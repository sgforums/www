It was based on the true story of what actually happened. The truth was that he was more than just a colonel. He was dealing with intelligence, and knew alot of classified information; you can imagine what would happen if he gets caught...in essence he becomes a value-added package on top of his Top Priority status... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"><br><br>But I agree with you on that part. We are all expendable. It was an irrational decision.

Or at least have Shugart and Gordon pick the enemy off from the Blackhawk. Once you leave the helo, you basically lose two elements: mobility and optimum tactical view of the scenario.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"></div>

Or be left behind and captured as a POW? Nobody would. The bn/bde commanders cannot guarantee that they will win the battle. They can't even guarantee that you will come back alive. The only promise they can make you, is the one that will try their damn best to bring you back alive; and should you fall in battle, they will at least bring the body/dogtag/remains back.<br><br>No it's is not some SF gung-ho attitude. I have no idea what to call this spirit, so I'll just loosely term it "brotherhood". It is something every fighting unit should posess. This will make everyone in the unit give their best, give the enemy hell; knowing the fact that should they falter or fall, their brothers <strong>WILL</strong> be there for them.<br><br>Call it the least we can do for our brothers in arms, give them a glimmer of hope. And in the case of the KIA who gave their lives for the cause, the very least we can do is take them back. Don't let them "ke si ta siang" while you get your ass safely home by hiding behind rocks and trees.<br><br>Years later, the world might forget the battle. But to those who were there, they would harbor no regrets having done what they could, when they could.<br><br>Furthermore, the SF snipers went in fully knowing there was a chance they might not come back. The BG even asked them if they knew what they were doing. They said yes then and went in. While they brought the pilot back, they themselves perished.<br><br>They took a risk and failed, but they still achieved something great in bringing the pilot back. If all our commanders don't have the balls to take risks at appropriate times, then I will be truely worried about the SAF.</div>

Hardly a good case to try to prove your point.<br><br>As someone said, COL Hambelton was a USAF EW specialist, and highly sought after by the NVA and their Soviet sponsors, and thus the Americans would do their utmost to get him out alive. Expendable? It hardly seems expendable when they mounted one of the largest SAR missions of the entire Vietnam war, spread over 11 days, and lost 3 SAR helos and 2 OV-10 FAC planes just get him out.<br><br>There was no carpet bombing of the area scheduled, it just so happened that the area COL Hambleton was in was packed to the wazoo with NVA troops because of the Easter invasion. Thus he had to move to a safer area before the SAR guys could get him out<br><br>In the meantime, heres a couple of links on the mission, theres also a full length book if anyone is interested:<br><br><a href="http://www.wpafb.af.mil/museum/history/rescue/res13a.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.wpafb.af.mil/museum/history/rescue/res13a.htm</a><br><br><a href="http://www.b66.info/Anecdotes/anecdote6.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.b66.info/Anecdotes/anecdote6.htm</a><br><br><a href="http://www.scopesys.com/cgi/bio2.cgi?bio=P119" rel="nofollow">http://www.scopesys.com/cgi/bio2.cgi?bio=P119</a></div>

All 4 were injured, incapacitated and alive?<br><br><strong>2) Knowing a mob of hundred with guns etc moving toward the crash site.</strong><br><br>And knowing that the very same mob would have torn the 4 crew from limb to limb if the CWO Durant's crew were alive?<br><br><strong>3) Not knowing when would any other frlendlies available for support.</strong><br><br>So, we leave the possibly alive friendlies down there to die?<br><br><strong>4) Knowing very well that 2 men against mob of hundred will not survive for very long.</strong><br><br>The operative word here is probably. There was a high chance they would not make it out alive, and Garrison as well as Shugart/Gordon knew that. But they also knew that if they didn't try and that cost 4 of their guys their lives they will never live it down the rest of their lives<br><br>The reason behind sparing no effort to rescue your friendlies is simple. It is to let you soldiers know that if they will get nothing less that 100% effort when it comes to support from their fellow soldiers if they are ever in a tough spot. If soldiers/pilots knew that their fellow soldiers will leave them to die because its the "rational" thing to do, how much effort do you think soldiers will put into carrying out their missions? Or even worse, won't they surrender at the first sign of being left behind and spilling the beans to preserve their lives?<br><br>As I've put across to you in an earlier Courageous thread, its easy to use 20/20 hindsight, dehumanise yourself and prattle on about logic and rationality till the cows come home without an iota of empathy. But try thinking for a moment if you were in Garrison's/Shugart's/Gordon's shoes, and it was your good buddy/brother down there. I'd like to hear you talk about being rational then.<br><br>I'm not saying the decision to go down to aid the crew of Super Six-Four is right or wrong. I'm just saying what I've been saying all along in this thread, we cannot judge other's decisions until we have, or at least tried to imagine how it would be like, to walk in their shoes.</div>

I have no idea what to call this spirit, so I'll just loosely term it "brotherhood". It is something every fighting unit should posess. This will make everyone in the unit give their best, give the enemy hell; knowing the fact that should they falter or fall, their brothers [b]WILL</strong> be there for them.<br><br>Call it the least we can do for our brothers in arms, give them a glimmer of hope. And in the case of the KIA who gave their lives for the cause, the very least we can do is take them back. Don't let them "ke si ta siang" while you get your ass safely home by hiding behind rocks and trees.<br><br>Years later, the world might forget the battle. But to those who were there, they would harbor no regrets having done what they could, when they could.<br><br>Furthermore, the SF snipers went in fully knowing there was a chance they might not come back. The BG even asked them if they knew what they were doing. They said yes then and went in. While they brought the pilot back, they themselves perished.<br><br>They took a risk and failed, but they still achieved something great in bringing the pilot back. If all our commanders don't have the balls to take risks at appropriate times, then I will be truely worried about the SAF.[/b]</blockquote>A grunt suppose to have "never say die" attitude, a commander should have a rational mind becos his decision affect everyone under him and the objectives.<br><br>The outcome is that one pilot captured, and additional two good men killed, are you sure it is success to send them in in the first place? What did they actually achieved?<br><br>First thing you must remember that no one knew anyone has survive the crash, they might be that everyone were dead. If that happened, the two snipers would be stuck and be killed or captured eventually and achieving nothing. ( 2 vs 100)<br><br>If the situation was one or more did survive the crash, if the two snipers did not went in, will they all be killed or captured?<br>Nobody know , but chances are some might be captured or killed right?(1-3 vs 100).<br><br>Even with all of them survive the crash and with snipers sent in, what are the chances of them getting out w/o being captured or killed?<br>(5 vs 100).<br><br>You see I have listed out all the possible outcomes for the decision to be made by the BG, odd are against them becos of the superior number that the other side have  and all dun look good.<br>The BG should be looking at all the pros &amp; cons and decide, knowing that the odds were against them and no means to change that becos he was unable to know when additional support was available to the two snipers.<br><br>Actual situation, was two additional men were killed, and the pilot was captured by the militants. The decision to capture him instead of killing him was made by the militant becos they want to have him for POW exchange.<br>So even w/o the two snipers been sent in, the militants might not even kill him.<br>And two snipers might actually achieve nothing,only as you called it "brotherhood spirit".<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hi All,<br><br>As for the rescuing of downed airmen or other POWs, it is not just a matter of dollar and cents like how many $$$ to train one pilot vs $$$ to train a SOF operative.<br><br>When a pilot go into combat, he/she needs to know that if he is downed, his countrymen will do all they can to get him out. That is why when a pilot is downed, they will risk a SAR chopper with "two" pilots at least one or two airmen/gunners to get him out. Why risk one heli, two pilots and two airmen for "one" guy. It is not just $$ and cents but doing what you need to do.<br><br>Similarly, when it comes to $$$ and cents why bother to even have a medic or cassavec your injured troops, if one is injured just leave him lah and continue with your mission. right??<br><br>It is not economic terms why one will rescue pilots or help injured soldiers but it is just something you need to know.<br><br>As for the BAT21, true story but don't know whether the movie got all the facts straight, he is a highly valued intelligence source and needs to be extracted at all cost.<br></div>

Like I've said, its easy for armchair warriors like you to to say what he should have done, what he shouldn't have done while sitting safely behind your keyboard.<br><br>You've obviously never read the Mark Bowden book, and like the Bat 21, using Hollywood dramatisations to draw your conclusions, because if you've read the book before shooting your mouth off, you would have realised that Shugart, Gordon, and the crew of Super Six Two circling above the Super Six Four crash site, reported that they have seen both Durant AND co-pilot Ray Frank alive AND moving. So your assertion that the 2 snipers and Garrison did NOT know if anyone survived on Super Six Four is just plain rubbish.<br><br>So if you want facts, lets talk facts gleaned from the books Blackhawk Down and In the Company of Heroes (Mike Durant's own book on his experiences in the Mog).<br><br>- Super Six One went down while spinning, hit a house on its way down, got it's nose crushed in the crash and ended up on it's side. Yet there were 4-5 suriviors out of 6-7 on board.<br>- Super Six Four went in an open area without hitting anything, it was relatively intact, no flames, no explosion, it was upright. Even with no eyeball confirmation of survivors, with the information above at hand, would it be wrong to assume there are survivors?<br>- Most importantly, it had been confirmed that both Durant and Ray Frank were observed to be alive.<br><br>Weekend warrior critics of Garrison, like you, picked on his decision to leave the final say on the 2 snipers going in to his subordinates and the snipers himself. Had he taken your suggestion and vetoed the attempted rescue, leaving Ray Frank and Durant on the ground to fend for themselves while Super Six Two circled above with 2 Delta snipers watching as they got captured, or worse killed and mutilated by the mob, I can picture the same weekend warriors castigating Garrison for leaving his pilots down there "to die" and accusing him of micromanaging the battle by remote control in his office in Mogadishu airport. With armchair generals armed with 20/20 hindsight like you, its damned if he does, damned if he doesn't.<br><br>Sure thing Gary, thats right, if its a difficult job, so don't do it at all.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>Walk the walk, or at least try to imagine walking the walk, before you talk the talk Gary. And try not to use Hollywood hogwash as exact narratives of history, because more often than not, they're historically inaccurate.</div>

So your assertion that the 2 snipers and Garrison did NOT know if anyone survived on Super Six Four is just plain rubbish.<br><br>So if you want facts, lets talk facts gleaned from the books Blackhawk Down and In the Company of Heroes (Mike Durant's own book on his experiences in the Mog).<br><br>- Super Six One went down while spinning, hit a house on its way down, got it's nose crushed in the crash and ended up on it's side. Yet there were 4-5 suriviors out of 6-7 on board.<br>- Super Six Four went in an open area without hitting anything, it was relatively intact, no flames, no explosion, it was upright. Even with no eyeball confirmation of survivors, with the information above at hand, would it be wrong to assume there are survivors?<br>- Most importantly, it had been confirmed that both Durant and Ray Frank were observed to be alive.<br><br>Weekend warrior critics of Garrison, like you, picked on his decision to leave the final say on the 2 snipers going in to his subordinates and the snipers himself. Had he taken your suggestion and vetoed the attempted rescue, leaving Ray Frank and Durant on the ground to fend for themselves while Super Six Two circled above with 2 Delta snipers watching as they got captured, or worse killed and mutilated by the mob, I can picture the same weekend warriors castigating Garrison for leaving his pilots down there "to die" and accusing him of micromanaging the battle by remote control in his office in Mogadishu airport. With armchair generals armed with 20/20 hindsight like you, its damned if he does, damned if he doesn't.<br><br>Sure thing Gary, thats right, if its a difficult job, so don't do it at all.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>Walk the walk, or at least try to imagine walking the walk, before you talk the talk Gary. And try not to use Hollywood hogwash as exact narratives of history, because more often than not, they're historically inaccurate.</div></blockquote>You're wrong, You are just been emotional and illogical, just like two snipers!!!<br><br>The BG  has of course reviewed all his option when the 2nd crash  happened, he tried to divert a group of men to 2nd crash but they were stuck.<br><br>Next of course to send a sufficient group men via helo but he did not have such luxury, otherwise if he has more than 10  men he would has given the order for them to go in but no, he has only two snipers in the air.!!!<br><br>He and his commanders knew that 2 men will not survive long against a 100 that was why they did not order them to go in !!!!<br><br>Only after the third requests from the snipers that he has relented even against his initial better judgement.<br><br>Why did he let them in? Was his initial assessment wrong?<br><br>No, his initial assessment was right, he relented based on emotions rather than logic.<br><br>You talk abt hindsight, do I really need any?!?<br>2 men against a hundred, what the chance of them surviving and able to escape capture or kill especially with casualty?<br><br><strong>None!!!!<br>A standard military offensive against heavily defended objectives is 3 : 1 to be successful.<br>Now you are talking defending an area with no fortifcation against the enemy number more then 20-50 times against yours?!?<br>A BG and everyone here should know that it can't be done. And I am not the only one here to say that!!!</strong>.<br><br>You talk abt looking at the mob and how they going to slaughter the survivor etc, yes it was difficult for the snipers to see this, that was why they wanted to go in , letting emotion ruled over their logic just like you did in your reply.<br><br>My view on this based on rationality, the BG as a commander with many men under him should likewise make rational decision, not emotional one. This case clearly show why it should be.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by Viper52:</div><div class="quote_body">Exactly! Thats what I've been saying all along!<br><br>Gary is using 20/20 hindsight, taking human emotions and the human psyche out of the equation, going by the assumption that Hollywood movies are 100% historically accurate and drawing his skewed, biased opinions.</div></blockquote>I dun think so, the movie is quite accurate and the reality is even worse. Let me quote from the citation for MOH :<br><br><blockquote>..........When Master Sergeant Gordon learned that ground forces were not immediately available to secure the second crash site, he and another sniper unhesitatingly volunteered to be inserted to protect the four critically wounded personnel, despite being well aware of the growing number of enemy personnel closing in on the site. After his third request to be inserted, Master Sergeant Gordon received permission to perform his volunteer mission. When debris and enemy ground fires at the site caused them to abort the first attempt, Master Sergeant Gordon was inserted one hundred meters south of the crash site....... Master Sergeant Gordon used his long range rifle and side arm to kill an undetermined number of attackers until he depleted his ammunition. Master Sergeant Gordon then went back to the wreckage, recovering some of the crew's weapons and ammunition. Despite the fact that he was critically low on ammunition, he provided some of it to the dazed pilot and then radioed for help. Master Sergeant Gordon continued to travel the perimeter, protecting the downed crew. After his team member was fatally wounded and his own rifle ammunition exhausted........</blockquote>It clearly show the crash site was "hot" with large number of enemy that they aborted the first attempt to land and have to land the 2nd time abt 100m away.<br><br>Later part said that they have exhausted all their ammo as well as those recovered from the wreck. This indicate a heavy fighting against a large group of enemy.<br><br>The citation is more or less agree with what have been shown on the movie.<br><br></div>
