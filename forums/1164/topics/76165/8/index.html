The moment you say you don't know, what rounds, you already clearly stated that you are not in a position to jusify their firepower, to do the job effectively !<br><br>If you send 2 guy in with M21 &amp; a car-15 with "amoured pirecing" rounds, and ask them to do anti-personal which the rounds is not suited for, then sending them in is not questionable ?  Is it not the job for professional commanders to know their ammos and their purpose, even viper52 and other like you, read about it from books ! Oh so the commander who send them in may not read enough books on guns and ammos, or we presume he have amnesia and forgot what rounds they are all issued. Whatever it is still a mistake on someone part ! </div></blockquote>Erm, even if they were using the greentips, it was too late to draw out as all the armed forces at that time would be using that round anyway after they phased out the M855 rounds. The greentip is supposed to be the standard issue round and I think they're still using it in Iraq today.<br><br>The reason is several. There was a lot of debate over the NATO and the US M855 5.56mm rounds when they were first introduced because their wounding ability was considered inhumane under the Geneva convention.<br><br>According to "theory" indeed, military rounds are supposed to injure, not kill the target. This is because an injured soldier is a larger liability then a dead one. An injured soldier takes more fight out of the enemy as some have to tend to him while a dead one is well, dead. Hence rounds that wound, and not kill make stragetic, though not tatical sense. In that sense, the greentip was designed to wound the target, and not kill it, unlike the M855 (Whose fragmentation was some sort of an unintended discovery)<br><br>Of course, they had no time to know that the sammies didn't really care if the rounds fired at them wounded or killed them, they just wanted to get their chops in without caring about losses and injuries. Against that kind of unconventional enemy, the M855 would be the best, but sadly, the military is a stiff organization and I doubt anybody saw this obvious coming.<br><br>So even if they returned to base also no point, that is, if they were using the greentips, for that would have been standard issue.<br><br>BTW, an M14 7.62mm actually does less damage then an M855 5.56 round, the effect is pretty similar to an AK wound, except the bullet tends to yaw after penetrating to a shallower depth in flesh.<br><br>Of course, the D-boys themselves, who were experts in weapons and ammo, would know the consquences of using the greentip versus an M855 round and given the choice, they would have elected for the M855 as spec ops have to kill, not wound their targers. Though it is not known if they were given that ability to choose their rounds or if they had no choice.<br><br>By the way, I dunno how Gary calculates the odds, but one percent seems ridiculus to me. It's a highly fluid situtation down there and the deck of cards can change in an instant. Those two D-boys didn't put themselves into danger foolishly and they certainly knew what they were doing and the risks involved. They getting killed if more of an effect of the fortunes of war then bad planning. The situtation was not hopeless, it was uncertain.<br><br>I suspect Gary's ultraconservative way of leading and hard headed thinking would get more people torn up. And if we follow his line of reasoning, he would be the only trooper electing to stay behind after the convoy decides to saddle up and return because according to him, it seems insane to return into an uncertain situtation for a blackhawk.</div>

Just like in the Saving Private Ryan movie the contradiction between military objectivity and moral obligations towards all soldiers and their families at home.<br><br>Then, the next step to handle such situation, or maybe the ultimate solution, is that the rescue team shall be totally non-human, but human-like.  The best illustration is a derivative of the Terminator cyborgs.<br><br>These humanoid war machines can wear skins to best suit the hostile environment where the prisoners are held or about to be taken prisoner/overrun by enemy.  Blending well with the enemy forces, their mission is to get as close to the prisoner(s) and guarding them against abuse or torture, while remaining undercover, until the most opportune time to release and escape with the prisoner as steathily as possible.<br><br>If cover gets blown, their primary roles as hunter-killers of the enemy would be activated to waste the entire enemy encampment before getting the prisoners out in one piece</div>

Count me in!<br><br>I tried donating some years back, but the mobile blood bank rejected me as I had been to Tekong a few months before the donation drive, and declared it on the blood donor form that I had taken anti-malaria medication.<br><br>Tell you what, can you start up a new thread on donating blood, and the details on how we can go about doing it, I'll make it a sticky thread for everyone to see.

You can have the best gun in the world, but if the ammo you use is unsuitable for the job at hand, the gun will be instantly rendered unsuitable for the task.</span></blockquote>Nowhere did the word useless come up in my argument, nor did I use that word.
