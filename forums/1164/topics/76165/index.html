            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by SpecOps87:</div><div class="quote_body">Hi guys,wonder if any of you guys watched BlackHawk Down?Anyway,if you recall,there is a scene where the 2 Delta Snipers requested to go in and provide cover for the Durant's downed BlackHawk as his site is in danger of being over-runned by hundreds of Mogs. Both Delta snipers were killed in the end and had their bodies dragged across the city.And Durant was captured and held for 11 days.<br><br>Just a general survey here.Will you do the same,for someone you just occasionally meet on base?<br><br>For starters,I will do the exact same thing done by the 2 Snipers.Extreme selflessness in the face of fire.And the fact that in war,its not politics or wat the commanders say.But I'm there,not to proof a political point or watever.I there to fight for those around me,and the belief that with each enemy i kill,there is one less enemy to threaten us with.And I will expend all but one round of my ammo and start hand-to-hand combat.When in danger of being captured,I will take my own life.You can have my body,never my soul nor believes.</div></blockquote>those who fight along side with mi is my brother.. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Just want to add my view on this incident, and I only based on what I have seen from the movie.<br><br>In the first thing, the BG should not have let the two snipers in to secure the area for 2nd down Blackhawk not matter how they plead for it , becos he could not guarantee that they will receive support in a very short time and at the same time knew that they will be surrounded by a mob of a hundred with guns, rifles and RPG.<br><br>Sending them in is a grave mistake by the BG , he should know that they will most probably will not survive and thus let two good men to die.<br><br>As for two men and the BG, they have let emotion rule over rationality.<br><br><img src="http://www.ravenshield-fr.com/images/RS_animation4.gif"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Gary1910 made the most sense out of all this.<br><br>In that same situation, I wouldn't do it, unless I have bucket loads of ammunition provided for me.  And personally, I wouldnt use a sniper rifle or rifle.   A nice SAW at least or GPMG.  Throw in a couple of Grenade Launchers as well as LAW tubes.  When in doubt, flamethrowers add a nice touch to things.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Was just wondering, according to that situation, the two delta snipers were in a blackhawk, could'nt they hover over the crash site and provide the same(or if not, better) help they could have done on the ground?

A plane already costs more than the snipers' entire training ever will. A pilot knowledge of his plane and the skies is much harder to replace than 2 snipers with their tactical knowledge and expertise.<br><br>No I don't like it either, but it's reality. Someone from our special forces told me that once. Sg would send in a team of special forces even it's just to rescue 1 pilot. That's even though we have tons of pilots around and only a handful of special forces members.<br><br>And of course it depends on the situation, like in the movie, no one can you to force to go in and create a perimeter. The situation is just too unstable, and it's not known whether the pilot is still alive.<br><br><strong>Was just wondering, according to that situation, the two delta snipers were in a blackhawk, could'nt they hover over the crash site and provide the same(or if not, better) help they could have done on the ground?

            <div class='col-md body'>Everyone is expendable including pilots, looking at the situation, it is to me grave tactical mistakes becos two soldiers won't last long in that situation.<br><br>Rescuing a down pilot by SF is another, with calculated risk and special training to do so.<br><br>If the risk is too high, even a Col will be left there.<br>I remember a movie abt a down Col in Vietnam, he was actually survieying an area to be carpet bomb becos of large concentration of enemy movement.<br><br>Becos of the high enemy concentration , many attempts to pick him by helo have failed, even losing pilots. But the plan to carpet bomb still went ahead even he was still in the area, becos he was also expendable.<br><br>Since he was in the loop of the plan he managed to evade the enemy and went into safety b4 the bombing started.<br><br><img src="http://www.ravenshield-fr.com/images/RS_animation4.gif"><br></div>
