If you put "not suitable bullets" to a M16, you cannot use that case to say my point that M16 is more suitable in that situation.</div></blockquote>Storywolf, no I did not leave the part about armour piercing out. Read the below quote which ws part of my <span style="text-decoration: underline;">VERY first </span> reply to you about M-16s in the situation, with the important parts set in bold<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;"><blockquote><div class="quote_from">there were much dissatisfaction with the ammo used in the battle, since <strong>it was designed to defeat body armour </strong>[/quote]<br><br>As for the 2nd part, its just splitting hairs. The fact is that the book stated clearly that the M-16/ammo combi used in the battle left much to be desired, and if there was more research done by you into the battle, the point about the M-16 would not have been brought up.<br><br>You cannot just compare guns, you have to factor in the ammo as well. You can have the best gun in the world, but if the ammo you use is unsuitable for the job at hand, the gun will be instantly rendered unsuitable for the task.<br><br><blockquote><strong>If normal 5.56 round are put in, the for distances below 300m, the 5.56's velocity make up for its short coming of the 7.62. So in a way it is still as capable a round to take down anyone. The only problem is for further distance, then, the 5.56 is disadvantage.</strong></blockquote>Not that you're wrong, but again, we're specifically discussing the guns/ammo used in the Mogadishu battle here, not in general.<br></div><div class="quote_body">[quote]<br>By the way, I don't memorized or put too much faith in facts on rifles and bullets from novels from pilot and journalist. </div></blockquote><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">  Mark Bowden's book is based largely from interviews with the Ranger and Delta soldiers who took part directly in the battle. The crticism of the ammo was levelled by the soldiers he interviewed, not by Mark Bowden himself. He just put their criticism into print. And Mike Durant is a NightStalker from the 160th SOAR, not your typical Air Force chopper pilot. I would dare say he knows his guns and ammo.<br><br>The books are narratives, not novels. There IS a difference.<br><br>For what it's worth, I'd put more faith in those books than the movie. Any day.</span></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>HEy man,bout the M-14 and M16s and Car-15s.Please note that the optical scopes fitted to their weapons are reflex scopes.They juz provide a 1.5X to 2.5X zoom feature to their weapons.And besides,the fact that the M-14 round delievers a heavier knock-down punch is definitely true.And the M-16s and Car-15s are loaded with the Army's new  "Green Tip" round.Its basically a 5.56 round tipped with a Tungsten Carbide Penetrator and is designed to punch through armour.Since noe og the sammies are wearing body armour,it is like sticking them with an ice pick.It just makes a clean punch through the body.Thus,there is not enough knocking power to knock them down.The point of shooting at the enemy is to make sure they get hit and they stay down.Thus,we should not question how the 2 operators get killed.<br><br>But,we must realise that its what they did that truly mattered.And its the fact that they volunteered and were not ordered to go in and secure the site.So why don't we give them our greatest admiration and salute the fact that they scarficise themselves so readily and self-lessly?<br><br>And btw,any ppl in Spec Ops community here?Please tell me if its advisable to load the magazines with ball,an armour piercing round and tracer?So that you get a mix of rounds?Thanx!!!</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I dunno why they were using green tip AP rounds against the sammies (I'm not sure if it has anything to do with the army deciding to be more green by replacing its old lead bullets), but in any case the old FMJ M855 and its modern variants 5.56mm the M-16 usually uses causes far more damage then an AK-74 round.<br><br>The higher velocity and smaller size of the 5.56 round tends to make it fail from hyrdrostatic pressure buildup when it enters flesh to a sufficent depth (4-5 inches), causing it to breakup into several fragments which in turn scatter at high velocities within the body, causing explosive decoupling of tissue and massive internal trauma.<br><br>The AK round, which heavier, is far more stable and punches a small hole. More damage is only done after the bullet has penetrated a considerable distance within flesh, about 14 inches I believe where it will tumble and finally end up base first. But the damage and trauma caused is far less then that of an M-16 round.<br><br>If you are hit by a fragmenting 5.56mm round in the torso, chances are you are likely to have taken a nonsurvivable wound. The main issue is that the 5.56 lacks takedown power, that is, while it can kill a person dead with on hit, usually unless it's a CNS or shot to the heart, the target usually has time to charge you, empty a magazine, or trample on you. A 7.62 has more knockdown power, but it's good to note that no round we have, except maybe a .50cal, which can blow off large chunks of the body, can actually knock down a person, people dropping when they are hit is more of a reflex action then the actual energy of the round.

Indeed.</div></blockquote>IIRC , i once read that the AP 5.56 round was actually meant to be use against modern body armour becos the standard 5.56 could not penetrate the modern body armour.<br><br>But when the AP is used against someone that do not have body armour , it actually went in and out thru &amp; thru , causing less damage than the standard 5.56mm round as you described above.<br><br>Well , anyway I am no medical doctor but I have ever seen on movies and heard story that at time when someone is shot once or more, it might not actually stop the person from fighting as long as he was not hit at some vital organs like the heart or brain or spine I think.<br><br>Sometime , ppl do not even realise that they are hit until they see blood on their body.<br><br>I remember once during NS that one man has actually has one of his finger sheared off &amp; did not realised it until someone told him so.<br><br>Another story abt the real story abt Israeli tank gunner, his tank was actually hit by a APFSDS which penetrated thru and out the turret and sheared off both his leg, he did not realised it &amp; continued fighting.<br><br>Therefore at time , even one who are fatally injured does not mean that he could not fight on for a while.<br></div>

But of course, the only fact you are concerned about was "100 on 2" which I dunno where you drew it from.<br><br>(Considering nobody actually saw the engagement, one wonders if it actually played out the way it did in the movie.)<br><br>And if you haven't listened to the commentary, go do so now, <strong>don't expect us to do your homework for you</strong>. So far you have been doing little but shooting from the hip based on your own shaky and personal opinion of a dramatization and then expecting people to put you straight. For goodness sakes and everybody's sanity, please get your facts right before you post anything.<br><br>Nobody's gonna deny your right to your own point of view, no matter how silly or wrong it may be. As you can see from my signature, while I don't agree with everything he's saying, I certainly found them funny as you are starting to become slightly amusing as well.<br><br>Anyway, I am amazed you can deduce the actual emotions and their context of the people and their actions in the situtation based on actors preformance in a dramatization in which Ridney Scott, which respecting his attempt to tell the story, himself has taken several liberities for the sake of making a movie.<br><br>At the same time, you said that you did not trust the book and the pilots, a nonfiction narrative and the people who were actually there and probably know a heck load more about actual combat and the tools of war then you can ever hope to know.<br><br>I think this entire pointless debate would have been avoided if you had simply done your basic homework before you came in here with lots of style, but no substance.<br><br>There were plenty of factors and things that could have been done, have been done, and have not been done in that incident. At the end of the day, was<br><br>And please, spare people the 100 on 2 canapoly crap. As I stated a few posts before, these were D-Boys, and they certainly weren't going in there to take on 100 (how on earth do you even know the number) sammies and fend them off the save the pilot. Due to many things beyond their control, things went wrong and they got killed. You can't simply pin this on a bad call on their part or the commander. It's just war. Things like this happen. You can be the best trained person with the highest level of skill, but still die. Wait... why am I telling you this? Oh yeah, because you didn't listen to the commentary.<br><br>What matters is that these soldiers did their duty to the best, or even beyond their call of duty given their situtation, and their actions were extraordinary. That deserves a MOH by any book.<br><br>If you didn't notice, there were situtations where small numbers of americans were isolated and had to fight off far larger numbers of skinnies as well. I don't see you harping on that.<br><br></div>
