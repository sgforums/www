And that is why unlike you, I'll not judge the actions of others so flippantly and summarily unless I'm sure I can do better than them.<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from"><strong><br>The BG  has of course reviewed all his option when the 2nd crash  happened, he tried to divert a group of men to 2nd crash but they were stuck.<br><br>Next of course to send a sufficient group men via helo but he did not have such luxury, otherwise if he has more than 10  men he would has given the order for them to go in but no, he has only two snipers in the air.!!!<br><br>He and his commanders knew that 2 men will not survive long against a 100 that was why they did not order them to go in !!!!<br><br>Only after the third requests from the snipers that he has relented even against his initial better judgement.<br><br>Why did he let them in? Was his initial assessment wrong?<br><br>No, his initial assessment was right, he relented based on emotions rather than logic.<br></strong>[/quote]<br><br>Again, you're plucking partial facts and pure fiction, and moulding them to suit your own judgemental opinions. From Blackhawk Down (the book not the Hollywood version):<br><br>1) The first request from the snipers was not vetoed outright by the Colonels in the C2 bird. They were told to hang on because no-one was sure if there were survivors. This prompted Super Six Two to go low over the Durant crash site, where both Ray Frank and Mike Durant were confirmed to be alive by those on board Super Six Two. The Colonels then told Super Six Two to hold on (again, not a veto) and take down as many targets as possible from the air, which the snipers did, while waiting for the 2 convoys to try to reach the crash site.<br><br>2) It was then observed from Super Six Two that both convoys trying to reach the Durant crash site were in trouble. That was when the pilots (not the snipers) asked for the snipers to be inserted AFTER telling the snipers of the odds (in case the 2 Delta couldn't see for themselves), to which both snipers concurred with the request and agreed to go in.<br><br>Now, to quote from the book directly (bold are mine to highlight points):<br>-----------------------------------------<br><span style="font-style: italic;">Up in the command bird, (Colonel) Harrell pondered the request. It was terribly risky, maybe even hopeless. <strong>But one or two properly armed, well-trained soldiers could hold off an undisciplined mob indefinitely.</strong> Shugart and Gordon were experts at killing and staying alive. They were serious, career soldiers, trained to get hard, ugly things done. They saw opportunity where others saw danger. Like the other operators, <strong>they prided themselves on staying cool and effective in extreme danger</strong>. They lived and trained for moments like this. If there was a chance to succeed, these two believed they would.<br><br>In the C2 bird, seated side by side, <strong>Harrell and Matthews weighed the decision.</strong> Their entire air rescue team was on the ground already on the first crash site. The ground convoy wasn't going to get to Durant and his crew fast enough. But dropping Shugart and Gordon would most likely be sending them to their deaths. Matthews turned down the volume of their radios momentarily.<br><br>"Look, they're your guys," he said to Harrell, "They're the only two guys we've got left. What do you want to do?"<br><br>"What are our choices?" Harrell asked<br><br>"We can put them in or not put them in. Nobody else is going to get to that crash site that I can see"<br><br>"Put them in" said Harrell<br><br><span style="color: red;"><strong>So long as there was even a tiny chance, they felt obliged to give it to the downed crew.</strong></span><br></span><br><br>------------------------------------------<br><br>Therein in the last sentence, is the difference between good soldiers and armchair critics like you. They had loyalty to their men, while you, will leave them to die in the name of "rationality" and "logic" while debating statistics. Error in judgement? Maybe. But illogical and ermotional? You're delusional<br><br>Now had you read the book, you'll have realised the decision was not made on a whim, like you're claiming throughout this entire thread based on watching a Hollywood movie. Duh.<br></div><div class="quote_body"><blockquote><br>You talk abt hindsight, do I really need any?!?<br></blockquote></div></blockquote>Yes. Look at your own judgement and the circumstances which you've made them under. You never once stepped into their shoes, you've never considered the circumstances they were in, you've never even bothered to read the facts from the book. As I've said all along in this thread, no one is fit to judge the 2 snipers actions until they've been through a similar situation, and you, Armchair General gary1910, sitting safely behind your keyboard, is ESPECIALLY not fit to judge them simply because of the fact that you are not objective enough to.<br><br>You just looked at the results of the battle, crunched some numbers and plucked some inferences from a Hollywood movie and drew your pea-brained conclusion. If thats not hindsight, I don't know what is.<br><br><strong></strong><blockquote><strong></strong><div class="quote_from"><strong><br>2 men against a hundred, what the chance of them surviving and able to escape capture or kill especially with casualty?<br><br>None!!!!<br></strong></div></blockquote>Wrong again!!! Slim, but not none. And whether as a soldier (the snipers) or a leader (the 2 colonels), you owe it to your comrades to try no matter how slim the chance, especially if you knew that theyÂ’d do it for you.<br><div class="quote_body"><blockquote><br>yes it was difficult for the snipers to see this, that was why they wanted to go in , letting emotion ruled over their logic just like you did in your reply.<br></blockquote></div>Again, assumptions suit your own tinted views while paying little attention to facts. Which witness did you ask to ascertain that emotion ruled logic? Which combat report did you read to draw that "conclusion"? Or did you just interpret that from watching a Hollywood movie?   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br><strong></strong><blockquote><strong></strong><div class="quote_from"><strong><br>My view on this based on rationality, the BG as a commander with many men under him should likewise make rational decision, not emotional one.

            <div class='col-md body'>Viper, debating with you is really wasting my time. Not only you resort to name calling, bloody immatured kid. All the postings you have did not change the odds at all!!!!<br><br>Your only reason that the snipers should be send in becos if there is any possibility of saving of down fellow soldiers, they should be regardless of risk! How stupid can one be!!!!<br>Becos if the chances is so slim, getting more friendlies been killed to do it is simply stupid!!!!<br><br>The way I see it is that the risk way too high, even the quote from the book agree. Two snipers not matter how well trained they are , they are still humans with rifles and pistols, not superman.<br>Against at least a hundred men with rifles and pistol and some RPG, the  chances of survival  is still none, even with all your quotes and new info from the book !!!!<br><br>In think in the history warfare, I believe that  is not a single case where 2 men could actually fight off 100 similar armed  men determine to kill them!!!!<br><br>Let me say this again in my previous post where you conveniently ignored:<br>A standard military offensive against heavily defended objectives is 3 : 1 to be successful.<br>Now you are talking defending an area with no fortifcation against the enemy number more then 20-50 times against yours?!?<br><br>You said it yourself that the snipers is survival  is slim, even they could hold the perimeter, they eventually  will run out ammo , which was the case.<br><br>Even with unlimited ammo, where could they go with an injured soldier surrounded by enemy at all side???<br><br>So who is being delusional, one who do not look at the odds, making decision w/o regard to risk and value.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br>And thingy abt the MOH,  they are awarded for their bravery not their intelligence.

            <div class='col-md body'>Hey guys,calm down man.Lets discuss this as adults and not go into name-callshin and all that crap.The point here is,that no matter what,the downed crew still deserves a chance and oppunity to be rescued.They have done their job,and the commanders knowingly let the 2 Delta snipers in so as to provide some form of morale boost for the crew if they are alive.And,we cannot in watever way belittle Gordon and Shurghart's part.They fought to the very end.It really pains me to see,and read that 2 men who are real warriors to the very ends.<br><br>These days,if not all,most military forces are made of paper-pushers.Who want <strong>stars</strong> and not [b]scars.So it is really heart-wrenching to see that the 2 Delta snipers volunteered themselves into the hot zone knowing fully that they might be killed in such heavy hostile activities.We salute them.And the only way for soldiers,is not to be a paper-pusher,but to make sure they walk the talk.And when the nitty gets gritty,they are able to pull the trigger, and give up their lives not for their country,but for their fallen brothers-in-arms.Coz when the first shot passes your heads,politics and all that load of crap goes out the window.The only thing that matters is,the man next to you.The onli person you can rely to cover your six and also do his part to make sure you two have the best chance of survival.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>First of all, there was quite a bit of evidence proving Mike Durant (the pilot) was still alive after the crash. I'll reiterate some more in addition to viper.<br><br><strong>A Blackhawk is built with shock absorbers to withstand a terrifically hard impact, so long as it lands in an upright position. And Durant's Super 64 Blackhawk was indeed upright.</strong><br><br>Quoting from the book it wasn't mission impossible to attempt rescue :<br><br><strong>"This was not a hopeless mission. One or two properly armed, well-trained soldiers could hold off an undisciplined enemy indefinitely. Shughart and Gordon were experts at killing and staying alive. They were career soldiers trained to get hard, ugly things done."</strong><br><br>Randall Shughart and Gary Gordon weren't your average run-of-the-mill peng kia. They belonged to the Delta Force. Enought said<br><br>Now, let's look at the judgement from the PoV of a higher ranked personnel of in the SAF. My <strong>CO</strong> screened the Black Hawk Down movie to the entire battalion right before our ATEC. After the movie, he addressed the bn and asked,<br><br><strong>"Would you do the same? Go in to rescue the pilot?"</strong><br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">*note : it's not exactly what he asked, but the essence is there*<br>No I'm not carrying balls here. I've aready ORDed. And no I did not like our CO. He implemented lots of rules and regulations that made life very hard on us ground level commanders. Though I have to admit he was a not-bad (i refuse to use "good" ) CO tactically. We got recon 2A-very-very-high, scored better in ATEC than any other combat unit that workyear including guards and cdo. Almost kena Charlie Mike for recon 1, knn sibeh heng ...</span><br><br>Anyway he replied that he would do the same thing. I presume he meant same as Col Harrell since, well he is the CO afterall. He said he would send in men to rescue down/missing/stranded men. He mentioned points to which I agreed, possibly for the very first time. What he said was about fighting spirit and brotherhood. All in my previous post ... go read it again.<br><br>Now you have it, from a infantry CO from SAF.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Just to add my 2 cents to this thoroughly discussed and chewed over issue. But in line with what meander has put up and with the current nicoll accident in mind, I must confess that my first impressions of what the 2 snipers did in Somalia was that it was a waste. But as viper pointed out, my pov was based on the film that I watched. Didn't managed to get the book though I was told that the film was really just an adaptation and facts that couldn't get compressed into the movie timeframe were left out.<br><br>After sifting through the arguments (name calling aside), I believe that this is a good case for us to reconsider and discuss - which was what people have been doing. Call it hindsight - but it is a useful tool for us to learn and reflect even before we have a chance to get into such a decision point ourselves. This what people in many schools do - it is called Case studies. Using real life cases for discussion and learning. I think we have been doing that and like all real cases, there is actually no correct answers. There might be extreme ones which is really up to one to accept but the real answers often are subtly different based on one's background and experiences.<br><br>My learning point, based on what have been discussed and what our leaders have decided to do in the nicoll highway case, is that one should try, as far and as best as we could, to rescue or help those in distress - simply because we would want others to do the same for us in the same situation. If I was Durant, I would really want the guys to drop in and pull me out NOW!. But when the odds are really down and we have done all that in our conscience to help - then we need to make that really cruel and difficult decision to halt all actions. Again - there is really no simple and clean cut yes or no, when or how. You call the shots, you bear the consequences. No one can really be the true judge of it, I think.<br><blockquote>Originally posted by meander:<br><strong>To those who say : <span style="font-style: italic;">"No, screw the pilot, leave him there.

We are all expendable. It was an irrational decision.

Lightly armed and armoured relative to the opposing forces whether they knew it or not.  They could have brought in the overwhelming firepower of the nearby M60s from the start, knowing these stuck-up 'Rangers Lead the Way' 'heros'.  Their doctrine is outdated in the light of street warfare.  Frankly, they need to make themselves heavier and be willing to be less mobile in order to fight this kind of war.  Either that, or let the regular Marines or Army/Armour lead the way instead.</div>

Funnily enough, I don't see the 2 snipers nominated or even winning that.<br><br><strong>[quote]<br>Maybe we should have the "Intelligence" awarded to<br>you?!? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"> </strong>Sticks and stone gary, sticks and stones.<br><br>What I know is not true will not hurt me.

Sniper are expert in killing people and survival, only if they are not seen ! The greatest danger a sinper is to be seen and shot at, They are totally unequip for gun fight with mobs ! Their main weapon is  mount with a 10x or at least 8x scope, which is tune to shoot at 600m to 700m, at the crash site with mob so near, that rifle is almost useless. Their seconday weapon should be a M16 variants. In the crash site, they became nothing much than 2 infantry with rifles, unable to use their unique sniper skills.<br><br>Yes they may have got medals for it, yes that is for their bravely which we all admired but that does not mean the decision correct. If getting medals is a measure that decision are correct, then we should count the medals that was given out the the people in the mob for killing the snipers too.<br><br></div></blockquote>Storywolf, if you want to look at it from just a purely military perspective, talk 3:1 odds, military textbooks et al, you might have a case. But as have been repeated over and over again, things are not so simple in this case. Before we call judgement, we must look at things from all those perspectives before making that call.<br><br>I shall not repeat them any more, because the same points have been made over and over again in various ways.<br><br>Besides, Shugart was known to be armed with an M14 semi-automatic rifle. Reading through the book, it is doubtful if M16 variants would be more useful in their situation, as there were much dissatisfaction with the ammo used in the battle, since it was designed to defeat body armour and the mobs didn't use any, there were several occasions when the Rangers and Deltas found that their 5.56s went right through without doing much damage and each target required several rounds before being stopped for good. Hardly something you'd want to in the snipers' position.<br><br>The M14, with its 7.62 x 51 NATO, made sure that the targets stayed down when hit.</div>

So what kind of <strong>real combat</strong> experience do you have to make that tag untrue when applied to you?<br><br>The older regulars have already agreed on this, and meander has already pointed out above, if we want to judge the actions of military men in a combat situation from in front of our computers without having been in real combat ourselves, we already are armchair generals.<br><br>As for the other "names" I supposedly called gary, I've already stated my case. If he wants to be thin-skinned see them as personal attacks, by all means.<br><br>To sum things up, if we want to be armchair generals, the least we can do is to try to be<br><br>- objective about it<br>- do proper research about it<br>- Keep an open mind, explore all perspectives<br>- do not rush to judge, and let personal bias colour our opinions and most importantly<br>- Show respect for their actions and sacrifices, even if we disagree with their actions<br><br>What Gary Gordon and Randy Shugart did took a special kind of courage and character, and their sacrifice deserves more than to have their actions and intelligence questioned by someone without an iota of combat experience, who was trying to dig himself out of a hole he put himself in the first place be judging without knowing all the facts<br><br>Certain individuals have showed an blatant and stubborn refusal to do so even to the slightest bit, and IMO, there is little surprise they should be called out for it.<br><br>I'm done on this topic if my counterparts are, but if they're game to continue, so am I.</div>
