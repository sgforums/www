Master Sergeant Gordon then went back to the wreckage, recovering some of the crew's weapons and ammunition. Despite the fact that he was critically low on ammunition, he provided some of it to the dazed pilot and then radioed for help. Master Sergeant Gordon continued to travel the perimeter, protecting the downed crew. After his team member was fatally wounded and his own rifle ammunition exhausted, Master Sergeant Gordon returned to the wreckage, recovering a rifle with the last five rounds of ammunition and gave it to the pilot with the words, "good luck." </blockquote><a href="http://www.army.mil/cmh-pg/mohsom.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.army.mil/cmh-pg/mohsom.htm</a><br><br>So is the citation from the US Army Centre of Military History wrong or I am wrong abt the large number of skinnies?!?<br><br>Read thru the whole citation, then make your conclusion abt the mob and the arrival of a large mob b4 they were inserted which the two snipers as well as their commanders were fully aware of the situation.Remember that were still two commanders in the air surveying the area, even Durant did not see how they were hit, the two commanders saw what happened, otherwise how they did know a large mob was approaching ???<br><br>So am I wrong that the commanders as well as the snipers knew that they will be facing <strong>a large mob of with automatic fire as well as RPG?!?</strong><br><br>Am I wrong that they knew they did not know when is additional support coming in?!?<br><br>The citation indicated them clearly!!!<br><br>Now we have three sources, the book , the movies as well as the actual citation from the US army , so which is more believable?<br><br>You guys give a lot of info but the odds still remains.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Gary is indeed the one who is caught up with emotionism here.<br><br>He can't get it out of his mind that the D-boys didn't go down there to fight 100+ skinnies or establish a perimeter. They were going down there to get the aircrew. Unlike Gary, who is mad enough to dream up such ideas, professional D-boys avoid firefightrs unless they really have to. Gary just can't get it out of his head that they weren't going in on a sucide mission. The outcome nevertheless.<br><br>Unfortunately, things did not turn out quite that way for them, and one thing that Gary has failed to prove, despite his exausive attempts to fit a square peg into a round hole, was that the D-operatives chose their actions based on emotionism and irrationality.<br><br>What's obvious is that they weren't going in there to fight sammies off (even the most irrational would know they didn't stand a chance), they were going in to get the crew otta there, and probably to some safe area they could hold out for a while until help arrived. It was a dangerous undertaking that went wrong. Could their plan had worked? Certainly, but it was risky and could go wrong, and it did.<br><br>How would they be considered irrational? If they decided that they could acomplish their mission by fighting off the mob on their own, and that was their main action plan. Which is nuts and certainly wasn't in their decks. They were forced to fight the mob, they certainly didn't camp out and wait for the mob to come to them while they sniped away.<br><br>Of course, need I mention after the battle one of the operatives actually went into the enemy zone for three days and three nights to recover the bodies of his comrades, and he did it. Now, 1 guy against a hostile city. I wonder what that reflects on his rationality.<br><br>The best I can determine is that Gary suffers from a bad case of hollywood logic, where the only solution he sees to the problem is by force and action alone. While they ended up using up all their ammo and having to fight to the finish. One wonders if that was their actual intention or plan when they went in. And if that wasn't their intention, their undertaking certainly wasn't irrational, or emotional. It was a calculated risk that went wrong.<br><br>If Gary's logic is to be followed, every soldier who died when the odds were against him is irrational or emotional.</div>
