            <div class='col-md body'>I know it is a bit strong but I find most "PEACE" lovers are senseless and are demonstrating for the sake of demonstrating.<br><br>No signs of terrorist in Iraq? So Saddam who invaded Kuwait for no good reason, Saddam who caused so much misery for the Kurds and Irana is NOT a terrorist? Someone who invaded Kuwait is not a terrorist? And so when USA invaded Iraq, it is a bully? What kind of logic is that?<br><br>Do not forget that after Saddam invaded Kuwait and was defeated, he was given 12 LONG YEARS to abide by sanctions but for 12 LONG YEARS, even the UN could not be 100% sure the SADDAM has abided by the sanctions? He was  given a 2nd chance but did SADDAM even want it? For 12 long years, he outrightly defied the UN sanctions and though there may not be proof that he has links to Osama or any terrorists, how good can a man be when he praises the work of the terrorists in the 911 incident?<br><br>Strangely enough, when Iraq invaded Kuwait, there were not so many PEACE LOVERS and DEMONSTRATORS who "RAN" to Kuwait and  be a Human Shield there? Why now USA attack IRAQ, these "PEACE" lovers are so quick to condemn USA? Is it about the war or is it because it is USA?<br><br>I  appeal to peace lovers out there, that no war is a win-win situation. It is always lose-lose. But it doesnt mean that if there  is no war, the situation would be win-win in fact in Iraq's case, it could even be an extremely lose-lose situation if Saddam continues to be in power.<br><br>Use your common sense before you appeal for NO WAR. I know its in fashion to shout "PEACE" and shouting for war makes you an evil man in the eyes of these legalistic "PEACE" lovers. But  as we all know, being fashionable is not always right.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>A joke someone sent me...<br><br><blockquote><br>How to deal with Peace Activists<br><br>With the current war, many of us will encounter "Peace Activists" who   will try and convince us that we must refrain from retaliating against   the ones who terrorized us all on September 11, 2001, the Bali attacks   and those who support terror. These activists may be alone or in a gathering... most of us don't know how to react to them. When you come   upon one of these people, or one of their rallies, here are the proper  rules of etiquette:<br><br>1. Listen politely while this person explains their views. Strike up a<br>conversation if necessary and look very interested in their ideas.  They   will tell you how revenge is immoral, and that by attacking the people who did this to us, we will only bring on more violence. They will  probably use many arguments, ranging from political to religious to   humanitarian.<br><br>2. In the middle of their remarks, without any warning, punch them in the nose.<br><br>3. When the person gets up off of the ground, they will be very angry and  they may try to hit you, so be careful.<br><br>4. Very quickly and calmly remind the person that violence only brings about more violence and remind them of their stand on this matter.  Tell  them if they are really committed to a nonviolent approach to undeserved  attacks, they will turn the other cheek and negotiate a solution. Tell   them they must lead by example if they really believe what they are  saying.<br><br>5. Most of them will think for a moment and then agree that you are   correct.<br><br>6. As soon as they do that, hit them again. Only this time hit them much   harder. Square in the nose.<br><br>7. Repeat steps 2-5 until the desired results are obtained and the idiot   realizes how stupid of an argument he/she is making.<br><br>8. There is no difference in an individual attacking an unsuspecting  victim or a group of terrorists attacking a nation of people. It is<br>unacceptable and must be dealt with, perhaps at a high cost.<br><br>We owe our military a huge debt for what they are doing for us and our   children (or future children). We must support them and our leaders at   times like these. We have no choice. We either strike back, VERY HARD, or   we will keep getting hit in the nose.
