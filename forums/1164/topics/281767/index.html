Some 85,000 Chinese soldiers attacked Vietnam through twenty-six points along the border. 3 weeks later, the Chinese announced that the campaign was over.<br><br>In spite of Vietnam's stategy of holding back its major forces to protect them from the onslaught, the Chinese lost an estimated 20,000 killed and wounded. Vietnamese casualties have not been announced to this day. (US casualties in the dozen years of fighting amounted to slightly less than 60,000 killed)<br><br>News clip on YouTube :<br><br><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ECbhcqdIN5g" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ECbhcqdIN5g</a><br><br>=====================<br><br>The US meanwhile, remained bogged down in Iraq.<br><br>Moral of the story- Singapore, or any other army can win a battle or a war, but should the victor hold on to territory and bleed? Should armies follow the Chinese model instead - bash up your enemy, then withdraw after you declare a victory (whether real or imagined)?<br><br>Up till this day, both countries claimed victory, but the fact remained that all the northern provincial capitals fell to the Chinese, and Vietnam would not dare to provoke the Chinese dragon in any way again.<br><br>Is the SAF ready to withdraw after battle? Or will the SAF prefer to bleed like the Americans?<br></div>

ThatÂ’s why they occupied Gaza strip, Golan Heights to absorb any mortar firing, rockets from likes of Astro etc.<br><br>Sg is even more samller than Israel, if unfortunately a war breaks out, beyong a swift war, maybe need to control such a buffer area like what Israelis have done and this thread may give you a clue: <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br><br><a href="http://www.sgforums.com/?action=thread_display&amp;thread_id=273272" rel="nofollow">http://www.sgforums.com/?action=thread_display&amp;thread_id=273272</a><br><br></div>

And the West was playing the Â“China cardÂ” against USSR coalition. Back in 1979, when the world was still in the cold war, Vietnam, being a number in USSR coalition then, actually was considered an cold war enemy by West. So, the PLAÂ’s war against Vietnam in 1979 was also considered a pro-west movement.<br><br></div>

In fact, at the opening phase, the NKPA were better equipped than the PLA who came to save them later on.<br><br>- The PLA was an expeditionary force with little or no armour, arty or air aupport. So forget about combine arms etc. Infantry was all the PLA had.<br><br>- The terrain were often barren hills with no cover and the UN were dug in on hills and mountain ridges. Some places where armour cannot climb even if they existed for the PLA. If not full frontal infantry assaults, then how else can anyone capture an objective?<br><br>According to a book I read written by a US Colonel during the war, he commended the cunning of PLA commanders in manuevers and marvelled at the discipline that allowed an entire PLA division to be hidden from US air recce during daylight in the barren Korean landscape.<br><br>He also praised the courage of the average PLA grunt.<br><br>The PLA conducted some skillful ambushes that nearly destroyed a US division or corps - all done with just infantry and some arty mostly mortars.<br><br>...<br><br>The PLA lost many troops in Vietnam cos not becos the PLA was utter crap - yes they were rusty and old-fashioned, but they were still solid infantry force.<br><br>The main reason is simply that the Vietnamese at that point were just too damn good. No army in the world at that point can go to Vietnam and come out in one piece.<br><br>That the PLA managed to penetrate deep into Vietnam showed their strength if not their skill. And they did achieve the limited goals they set at the onset of the war so you can't say they lost.<br><br>Losing a lot of men may count as a defeat for some armies, but then we're talking about the PLA. Just as NVA/VC lost a lot of men against the French and US but they won both wars no matter what anyone says.</div>

Their citizens were 200% behind the war effort ALL THE WAY during WW2.<br><br>It's just that after WW2, the US itself was never really threatened and most of the wars US fought seemed pointless to its people.</div>
