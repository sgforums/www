To suggest that USA's attack open up a whole new world of wars, that is ridiculous. If that is so, why did World WAr I or II stopped? It stopped because all recognised EVIL forces were  stopped. If the theory of ripple effect is so true, world war II wouldnt have stopped, because it will just go on and on but it did stop. So now, what makes you think this think wun stop, USA has invaded Iraq, it has not announced plans to invade  any more. It may have stopped if all EVIL has been taken out. After a war like this, feelings and emotions rise, it is normal that many countries will start feeling insecure, it is the same after every war. So to suggest so QUICKLY that this war is bad and will cause major ripple effect sounds to me a bias towards USA rather than being objective.</div>
