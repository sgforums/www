The US is there for one purpose: Money. Money in the Iraqi oil contracts, money to rebuild Iraqs shattered infrastructure from 12 years of US bombs and Saddams destruction, money from the arms sales to rebuild Iraq's devastated armed forces. If the US wanted justice served it would have done so in 1991<br><br>I agree that the "No blood for Oil" slogan is puzzling, because a more appropriate one would be "No blood for money"<br><br>Heck, Saddam is no longer in power, so at least theres something to celebrate about.</div>

Take the opportunity of unsuitable weather(how long will it last, 6 months at most?) to:<br><br>- Allow the inspectors to carry out their work eventually fail Iraq on cooperation/adhering to UNSC resolutions(almost a certainty with Saddam) and<br><br>- brining up force levels to a higher level (example moving the 4th ID and their associated equipment into place) so stronger forces will be in place once weather cools again. Then maybe the war wouldn't have hung on a thread when the Marines almost got bogged down in Nasiriya.<br><br>No one is asking the US to wait forever.

            <div class='col-md body'>Who cares what everybody feels... seems like people are siding with Saddam simply on basic of race and religon, not that who is really doing more harm to the iraqi people...<br><br>It Saddam was really the nice cool leader that some arabs support, I think the best judge of that would be the iraqi people, who on their own accord, without be coherced by any regime, started tearing down his images and stomping their foot on them. The iraqi people have spoken, they want saddam out, even if it means that some of them are going to die in the war. Better to die in the path for a better future then back to saddam's hell.<br><br>And that's what's matters, the opinion of the iraqi people, not what pro-us or pro-iraqi people may say here. What the iraqis have chosen now is clear. It's obvious they do not want indefinate american rule, and will have to form their own govt, but it's something they want, and saddam is not part of the picture in that govt.<br><br>Of course, there's little sense in the americans really wanting to occupy the country indefinately as well, not in the sense of costs, but also because a truly friendly regime will not be created by american oppression, but by a country in which the freedom of the iraqi people to choose their govt. is realized. Besides, the US pratically ahs the middle east on a noose, consuming 40 percent of the world's energy resources anyway. If arab nations want the US to fail economically and military in this operation, then they are in sense, predicting their own demise as well. America keeps the money flowing in the gulf. If any self-interest was involved in this war, it's not the capturing of iraqi oil reserves for a monopolostic free grasp on it as if they dun have enuff oil (no dobut to much world disconsertation), but to open up another friendly regime that will supply them this resource in return for cash. It benifits everybody, the americans and as well as the iraqi people would can now finally have the cash to make their country rich and prosperous the way it was supposed to be, free from tinpot dictators like saddam.<br><br>It sure beats oil-for-food.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I believe everyone is entitled to his/her opinion. In my case I think the war is justified regardless if it is make in the name of democracy, freedom or money/oil. For democracy, freedom, it means a better life for iraqis and its neighbours, no more fear of torture, rape and less likely of occupation in neighbouring small countries. For money/oil, it might mean a better world economy for us all. Afterall, better to have a madman controlling the oil and propping up the worldwide economy (considering the fact that world's fortune depends a lot on US economy) than to have a dictator controlling the oil and using its proceeds to fund WMD program and threatening the Gulf stability.<br><br>It may be true that iraq have difficulty delivering WMD using a ballistic missile but there are always other methods of doing so. By carrying the core of a dirty nuclear bomb on a suicide bomber. By carrying a small vial of bio-agents required to release it into the environment. For a diehard terrorists, if they had the will, there will be a time when they will succeed. When that happens, isn't it too late to say "see I told you so".<br><br>If sanctions and inspections had worked, why is it that iraq was caught redhanded with illegal missiles? If he is innocent, why does he ordered interferrences with UN weapons inspectors? He could have cooperate fully with UN and discredit US if there are no WMD to be found. By doing so, he would have achieve a political victory in the arab world. However he chose not to do so, surely all these unanswered questions will leave the international community pondering.<br><br>As for harbouring terrorist, after the news that a palestine terrorist was caught in iraq, that sure say a hell lot about iraq. There have been intelligence sources that iraq was giving money to palestinian suicide bomber to kill Israelis. If that it not supporting terrorism, then what is. If the dictator aka saddam aka piece-of-s.h.i.t is such a "noble" arab, he should be giving land to palestine and let them settle in his country.</div>

All along I just held out my view that this war is necessary to rid Saddam. I know there are civilian death and injuries...... still it's a lesser evil when compared to them being gased and murder/killed by the regime. I believe thousand more would have died and treated unfairly if otherwise.<br><br>At least now Iraqis have a chance at a better future for themselves and their children with Saddam out of the picture <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_idea.gif" alt="Idea" title="Idea"><br><br></div>

The pictures reveal that someone has written the words 'Ali Baba - Haram(i)' (which means Ali Baba - thief) in Arabic on the prisoners' chests.<br><br>The article quotes a US military officer as saying that this treatment is an effective method of deterring thieves from entering the park and is a method which will be used again; another US military officer is quoted as saying that US soldiers are not allowed to treat prisoners inhumanely.<br><br>"If these pictures are accurate, this is an appalling way to treat prisoners. Such degrading treatment is a clear violation of the responsibilities of the occupying powers," Amnesty International said today.<br><br>"Whatever the reason for their detention, these men must at all times be treated humanely. The US authorities must investigate this incident and publicly release their findings."<br><br>Article 27 of the Fourth Geneva Convention clearly states that "Protected persons are entitled in all circumstances, to respect for their persons, their honour, their family rights, their religious convictions and practices, and their manner and customs. They shall at all times be humanely treated, and shall be protected especially against all acts of violence or threats thereof and against insults and public curiosity".<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Here is my position on this whole sordid Iraq conflict.<br><br>There is no question that Saddam Hussein deserved to be toppled. This is regardless of whether or not he possessed WMD or harbors terrorists. He is a reprehensible man who needs to be brought to justice.<br><br>However, for the US to have instituted regime change without explicit UN sanction and hence in defiance of international law is replacing a bad problem with a worse one. It is like burning your house to the ground to kill a cockroach. By this move, the US has created a world where it is acceptable for one nation to preemptively attack another without UN sanction, simply on the <strong>suspicion</strong> that it is a threat. This undoes a century of diplomatic progress and returns the world to the state it was before even the creation of the League of Nations.<br><br>Think about it. Now it is acceptable for Indonesia to attack us if Mega wakes up some day with a delusion that we are a threat. The US will stand aside because that is its own policy. The UN will stay silent because the US carries a veto. Even the international (i.e. US controlled) media will say nothing, since they have been whipped into a war frenzy. Now any nation can go to war with any other and nothing will happen. No sanctions, no UN peacekeepers, no bad press. Think about it.<br><br>Even if Saddam Hussein tore babies from the wombs of the pregnant women he had raped and ate them pureed with a nice Chianti, this is not worth it. There are worse things than even a hundred Saddams, such as a world plunged into an international cold war with a dozen enemies on all sides. It is like the Romance of the Three Kingdoms, except worldwide.<br><br>This kind of world only works if you are stronger than everybody else, i.e. it only works for the US. But for everyone else, the world is now a terrifying place. Look past what CNN and BBC is saying and you will find that everybody is scared. This war benefited no one but the Americans, and we are not Americans.<br><br>Be afraid, be very afraid.</div>
