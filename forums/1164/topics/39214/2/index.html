The previous UNSC resolutions and weapons inspections ran for years, and were finally bearing results before Saddam kicked them out in 1998.

By talking about morals when your Iraq policy is all about money like the US, thats HYPOCRISY. Do you know the difference in meaning between the 2 words?<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="Arrow" title="Arrow"> Admitting?  France and Russia admitted and openly declared their actual reason for opposing war?

The US went to war WITHOUT a consensus. What kind of precedent are they setting? And whos next? Now anyone with a stronger military can march into their neighbours land on some lame pretext for "regime change" because of the wonderful example set by the US. With this geopolitical implication in mind, whos the real threat to world peace and stability? In case you still don't get it, let me repeat again:<br><br>I am opposed to a war against Iraq WITHOUT international consensus and PROPER PROOF of Iraqs wrongdoings. I will happily support a war when the above are adhered to.<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="Arrow" title="Arrow"> Right.

Hmmmm, isn;t the rest of the world at fault for NOT supporting the US in this case?<br><br>And don't try to lecture me on how Saddam has mistreated his people and caused regional instability. I saw the news when he gassed the Revolutionary Guards and Halabja, I saw the newsclips of him invading Kuwait and his men line up Kuwaitis to be shot by the beachfront in Kuwait City. What were you doing then?<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="Arrow" title="Arrow"> LOL, can't remember , but i think I was doing what any 3 year old would be doing. . .<br><br>You talk about responsibility, spending on public etc etc as a condition for allowing a country to build nukes?

And how pray tell did you arrive at the conclusion? Lets examine a few facts:<br><br>* North Korea's missiles are known to have a range of at least 800 miles, and it is already known that a newer version that can reach 1000. Saddams Al-Samoud(a locally modified SA-2 Guideline SAM) missiles have trouble reaching 200.<br><br>* Iraq has been under sanctions since 1991, making it difficult to smuggle weapons in. North Korea has no such problems giving it unfettered access to the market in WMD.<br><br>* Iraqs WMD program has been severely damaged in Desert Storm, and set back by a couple more limited military strikes since then, in addition to being subject to constant surveillance by U-2s and American satellites. N Korea's WMD program has been allowed to continued unmolested, save for the occasional satellite pass.<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="Arrow" title="Arrow"> North Korea also happens to not have started a war in 50 years, or maybe thats cos they never formally ended the Korean War, but anyway, they have not conducted any large scale military operation in 50 years.  Though yes, they have counducted terrorists strikes against SKorea.<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="Arrow" title="Arrow"> Who said North Korea has been allowed to continue as they wish?  What was the US surveilliance plane that was almost shot down by the NKoreans doing there?  US and other countries have also attempted to close NKorea's reactor by promising them oil shipments and help with nuclear reactors that do not produce weapons-grade nuclear material.<br><br>And Iraq's the bigger threat?

No post-Desert Storm UNSC resolution on Iraq's WMD authorises the use of force should Iraq not cooperate. US tried to get a "use of force" clause added to 1441 but was shouted down by most of the UNSC who insisted that such a clause must be voted on in a SEPARATE resolution, which the US tried to bribe, beg, threaten and browbeat the UNSC into voting on one using the rubbish it calls proof of Iraq's non-compliance. Unfortunately the UNSC refused to, and reduced the US into violating the UN Charter to carry out Dubya's agenda.<br><br>If theres clear, undeniable proof of Iraq's non-compliance, which I'm sure would have been discovered had the inspectors been given more time given Saddams track record, what makes you think consensus from the UNSC would not been forthcoming?<br><br>Yes, the world needs people who make things happen, but not a brain-dead, stubborn Texas redneck cowboy masquerading as one</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I know it is a bit strong but I find most "PEACE" lovers are senseless and are demonstrating for the sake of demonstrating.<br><br>No signs of terrorist in Iraq? So Saddam who invaded Kuwait for no good reason, Saddam who caused so much misery for the Kurds and Irana is NOT a terrorist? Someone who invaded Kuwait is not a terrorist? And so when USA invaded Iraq, it is a bully? What kind of logic is that?<br><br>Do not forget that after Saddam invaded Kuwait and was defeated, he was given 12 LONG YEARS to abide by sanctions but for 12 LONG YEARS, even the UN could not be 100% sure the SADDAM has abided by the sanctions? He was given a 2nd chance but did SADDAM even want it? For 12 long years, he outrightly defied the UN sanctions and though there may not be proof that he has links to Osama or any terrorists, how good can a man be when he praises the work of the terrorists in the 911 incident?<br><br>Strangely enough, when Iraq invaded Kuwait, there were not so many PEACE LOVERS and DEMONSTRATORS who "RAN" to Kuwait and be a Human Shield there? Why now USA attack IRAQ, these "PEACE" lovers are so quick to condemn USA? Is it about the war or is it because it is USA?<br><br>THere could really be a agenda to Bush attacking USA but hey, at least this war is gonna bring some positive to humans in Iraq esp the women rather than letting them suffer under Saddam.<br><br>Saddam was the one who killed the civilians in this war, not Bush. Who was the ONE who brought the war into the urban areas? Who was the ONE who surrounded themselves with civilians? SADDAM did, because he knows that if bombs come in, it will kill civilians and thus USA will be labelled 'EVIL', 'KILLER' and many more...IF SADDAM truly  loves his people would he bring the war into an  area where there are so many civilians? He is the true KILLER. Unfortunately, many 'BRAINLESS' peace lovers again fell into the trap and shouted for "DOWN WITH USA" because the bomb fired is by USA but they forgot who put the civilians there to be bombed.<br><br>I appeal to peace lovers out there, that no war is a win-win situation. It is always lose-lose. But it doesnt mean that if there is no war, the situation would be win-win in fact in Iraq's case, it could even be an extremely lose-lose situation if Saddam continues to be in power.<br><br>Use your common sense before you appeal for NO WAR. I know its in fashion to shout "PEACE" and shouting for war makes you an evil man in the eyes of these legalistic "PEACE" lovers. But as we all know, being fashionable is not always right.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>And the geopolitical repercussions of the US's unilateral actions in Iraq starts. I've predicted this in my earlier posts in this thread before, now any country can see the US action in Iraq w/o UNSC approval as <span style="font-style: italic;">carte blanche</span> to do as and when they please. Only this time its between 2 <strong>certified</strong> nuclear powers who have <strong>not</strong> signed the NPT and have <strong>not</strong> made a "no first use" of their nuclear arsenal.<br><br>Not a good sign of things to come,<br><br>---------------------------------------------------------------<br><br><strong>India warns it may strike first as Pakistan is like Iraq</strong><br>Islamabad's nuclear arms and support for Kashmiri guerillas make it a better case for intervention than Baghdad, says Delhi<br><br><a href="http://straitstimes.asia1.com.sg/asia/story/0,4386,182731,00.html?&lt;br%20/&gt;" rel="nofollow">http://straitstimes.asia1.com.sg/asia/story/0,4386,182731,00.html?<br></a><br><br>NEW DELHI - Asserting the same right of pre-emptive war that the United States used to justify its invasion of Iraq, Indian officials have accused Washington of failing to end Pakistan's support for guerillas in Indian-controlled areas of Kashmir.<br><br>They also warned that India may be forced to take limited military action against its nuclear-armed neighbour.<br><br>In a series of recent public statements, Indian officials have stepped up accusations that, contrary to assurances he gave the US last spring, Pakistani President Pervez Musharraf has been giving free rein to militants fighting to end Indian rule in the disputed Himalayan region.<br><br>While India has made such charges before, it has lately begun to draw parallels to the US-led invasion of Iraq.<br><br>Foreign Minister Yashwant Sinha told Parliament on Wednesday that Pakistan's nuclear capability and alleged support for the Kashmir groups make it a 'fitter case' for intervention than Iraq.<br><br>Indian officials said that following a brief crackdown on militant groups last summer, Pakistan is now permitting the operation of up to 120 training camps for the fighters and is once again helping them cross the ceasefire line - called the Line of Control - that separates Pakistani and Indian forces in Kashmir.<br><br>Moreover, they said, intercepted messages provide strong circumstantial evidence that two of Pakistan's largest militant organisations - Lashkar-i-Taiba and Hizb ul-Mujahidden - collaborated in the March 23 massacre of 24 Hindus in the Kashmiri village of Nadimarg.<br><br>A senior official in India's Home Ministry, which handles internal security, said in an interview this week that at least 3,000 'trained Pakistani cadre' are currently operating in Indian-held Kashmir.<br><br>India regards these people as terrorists. Pakistan said its assistance to those it describes as 'freedom fighters' is limited to diplomatic, political and moral support.<br><br>It has condemned the Nadimarg massacre and called for an independent third-party inquiry into it.<br><br>'This is creating the impression that the United States is unable to put sufficient pressure on Pakistan,' Indian Foreign Secretary Kanwal Sibal said in an interview.<br><br>'If these terrorist attacks on a large scale continue, then at some stage in terms of our public opinion, the government will find it very difficult to continue to absorb this.'<br><br>Mr Sibal said that comparisons between Pakistan and Iraq were rhetorical in nature and were not intended as 'advance indication for any kind of imminent action' against Pakistan.<br><br>Nevertheless, Western diplomats both here and in Islamabad are worried about the potential for military conflict later this spring, when mountain snows recede and militant infiltration typically increase.<br><br>They fear that India, which nearly launched a war on Pakistan last year following terrorist attacks against the Indian Parliament and other targets, may feel it has no option but to take action if there is another incident on the scale of the Nadimarg massacre.<br><br>While such a response would likely be limited to air strikes on training camps or army posts on Pakistan's side of the Line of Control, diplomats worry that the situation could escalate out of control.<br><br>Both countries have small nuclear arsenals.<br><br>Western diplomats assert that the case against Pakistan is not as clear-cut as Indian officials claim, but they have been dismayed by what they regard as Mr Musharraf's failure to fulfil the promise he made last spring to permanently end militant incursions into Kashmir.<br><br>They said they generally concur with the Indian assessment that after dropping sharply in June and July, infiltrations increased - by how much is unclear - in the latter half of last year before trailing off in February due to heavy snowfalls. -- The Washington Post[/b]</div>
