            <div class='col-md body'>Hmmm.. .  I was seriously pissed with the views of stupid idiot at the <a href="http://www.Channelnewsasia.com/showdown" rel="nofollow">www.Channelnewsasia.com/showdown</a> forum, so i typed this out and tried to post it there, but somehow couldn't work. . . lucky i typed out in notepad, else would have lost the thing. . .dunno why i can't post on  the CNA forums. . . decided to post it here:<br><br>I am highly in support of the war effort in Iraq and would like to express my opinions.<br><br>While many were worried about the Aacademy Awards not being able to reflect the mood of the war, I feel that this should not have been our main concern.<br><br>Actors and actresses are by nature outspoken people.  And many of them are against the war effort in Iraq.  However, is it morally right to oppose the war NOW? At this juncture in time when thousands of US troops are in combat zones in Iraq?  How would opposing the war effort do any good?  When the acceptance speeches of the various winners are used to criticise the US war effort, I feel it is not doing justice to the fact that US troops are risking their lives in the gulf.<br><br>I am also puzzled by the 'No Blood for Oil' slogan, one which has recieved mass appeal among anti-war protestors.  We should ask ourselves if the US is actually fighting for more oil.  If the countries in the coalition really wanted more oil from Iraq, wouldn't it make more sense, both politically AND economically, to lift UN sanctions on Iraq?  Also, if cheaper oil ws available to US consumers, then where would the small-time oil producers in the US find their business?  It is also worth noting that many of these small-time producers showed great support for Bush during the elections and that as such, Bush would not want to alienate them.<br><br>Slogans such as 'Babies vs. Bombs' also do not make any sense.  There is no specific campaign to bomb Iraqi babies that I am aware of.  Would we rather that these babies grow up in a hostile and oppressive country with little links to the outside world?  Or should we take a chance and give these babies a chance at growing up in a more friendly environment.<br><br>People all over the world want peace.  I want peace too, despite the fact that I am in support of military action taken against Iraq.  However, my idea of peace is very very different from that of the anti-war protestors.  My idea of peace is a stable world where WMD do NOT  lie in the hands of dictators, and that peace is brought to people on a larger scale.  The idea of peace for many anti-war protestors is that of everything continuing as is and with no major wars that will destabilise their precious economy or cause the price of their household items to rise.<br><br>For those who question why the US attacked Iraq first instead of North Korea, my opinion is that it is because Iraq is sitting on alot of oil.  No the US does not want this oil for itself at ridiculously low prices.  However, the fact that Iraq has oil allows it to barter or sell this oil through the black market in return for more weapons.  Iraq's ability to build up a powerful armed forces with WMD is much higher than that of Nort Korea's due to Iraq's oil resources.<br><br>Many countries and protestors have complained about the US going to war without the backing of the United Nations.  My point of view is that is it the entire United Nations or is it a select few with a loud voice, for example France?<br><br>Remember that the French were responsible for helping Iraq build the Osirak nuclear facility to produce plutonium and that it was eventually the Israelis who had to bomb this nuclear facility before it went operational.  This does not make the French very credible and proves that they are not exactly very discerning.  While the US once supplied Iraq with weapons, the French almost gave them the ability to create their own nuclear weapons!<br><br>If those out there protesting against the war effort really cared about the Iraqi people, why did they not help the Iraqi masses in the first place through humanitarian aid?  Why only now does their 'care' for the Iraqi people show?  Is it because in this case, not only do the Iraqis suffer, the protestors themselves stand to lose from higher market prices?  Many anti-war protestors have not even thought about why the US is going to war.  It is my view that many are simply joining in such protests so that they can FEEL like they're part of something big.<br><br>The number of assasination attempts on Saddam, coupled with his few live public appearances, bear testimony to his popularity among the Iraqi people.  The tactics that he has used to ensure the survival of his military also shows he lack of concern for his own people.  Actions such as using his own civilians to shield his soldiers and placing targets of high military importance in civilian areas play upon the fact that the US government rational and is restrained by many forces, which include that of public opinion, which do not allow them the indiscriminate massacre of civilians.  Iraq knows that the US are unlikely to attack their military installations if these are placed in civilian localities, or that the US has a high chance of hitting Iraqi civilians, which will be a publicity boost for the Iraqi government since it puts the US government in bad light.<br><br>Those who have read the news will also know that Iraq has claimed that its FARMERS have shot down 2 US AH-64D Longbow Apache choppers.  If this were true, doesn't it mean that Iraqi civilians should also qualify as targets?  Since they pick up arms and take a hostile action against opposing forces, they shouldn't be protected by the Geneva Convention and therefore are legitimate targets.  But can and will the US attack this hostile part of the civilian population?  I doubt so because the US government will once again be restrained by politics and public opinion on such an issue.<br><br>In conclusion, the US is right in its war effort against Iraq.  Their actions will help bring about greater peace than the combined actions of all the anti-war protestors.<br><br>PS. Note that I do not consider all peace activists anti-war protestors. There is a difference in being anti-war and wanting peace because there are occasions when war can actually help to conclusively stabilise an unstable region by removing a rogue power.  The current situation in Iraq is one good example.<br><br>Also, for those who wonder why US is persecuting so many Muslims, read the writings of Dr. Akbar Ahmed, and Islamic scholar and Professor of International Relations.  There is no problem with Islam, the problem is the interpretation of Islam by a few sick individuals.</div>

            </div>
            <div class='col-md body'>Much of the opposition from the Iraqis to the US war against Iraq stems from the fact that the US failed to deliver in the Gulf War in 1991.  In 1991, when many thought that the US would topple Saddam, it pulled out after Kuwait's sovereignity was restored and Iraqi forces retreated.  This has created a certain uncertainty among the Iraqis about how far the US is willing to go in their push to topple Saddam this time round.<br><br>It is exactly that because that the French have vested interests in Iraqi oil that they do not want the US to butt in destroy this economic oppurtunities for them.  It is worth noting that putting more oil on the international market will drive down oil prices and hurt oil producers in the US as well.  These are the same oil producers who contributed to Bush's election campaign funds.  Iraq needs large amounts of hard currency to rebuild their country after Saddam is toppled.  That is where the money from oil is going, rebuilding the Iraqi economy, not serving the own needs of the US.<br><br>While lifting UN sanctions may result in US not getting the largest share in Iraqi oil, I believe that the US administration would not want to go to war and face opposition from so many protestors just to get the lion's share in iraqi oil.  The economic and political costs do not justify the economic boost that the US may obtain from Iraqi oil.<br><br>The US is not exactly suffering heavy losses here.  Each and every loss is identified in name by the media.  The amount of media coverage for each death for the coalition forces gives the impression that the casualty rate for the coalition forces is very high, however, this is not the case, especially if the compare it to the number of Iraqi military deaths and number of Iraqis taken prisoner.<br><br>No this will not be another Vietnam because I do not believe this war will drag for extended preiods of time like in Vietnam.<br><br>If Saddam falls, a new leader would have to rise from among the loyalists to the current Iraqi regime for any insurrection to be successful.  If a new leader can rise to stage sustained insurrection against US forces, the US would have failed becasue they would have removed Saddam only for him to be replaced by another similar character.<br><br>The current objective is Baghdad, civilian and military concentrations are being avoided, largely also to reduce the loss of lives of both forces.  I believe support for the current regime will be greatly reduced once the US has taken over control of Baghdad and Iraqis are shown the US intention in invading Iraq.<br><br>Yes the invasion of another country is never right.  But when the intention for the invasion stems from a want to topple a despotic ruler who has proven in the past that he will not hesitate to seek oppurtunities to expand his own territory for selfish gains (Kuwait), I that the invasion can be suitably justified.<br><br>You claim that the invasion of another country is never right, what then, about Iraq's unprovoked invasion of Kuwait?  Was that right?  In any other country, what would have happened had its leaders taken it upon themselves to take carry out an unprovoked invasion against another sovereign country?  Would the leaders of the counry which invaded another country be allowed to stay in power?  Shouldn't there be any street protests from Iraqis against their leaders decision to invade Kuwait?  In a coutnry where people are more outspoken, largely because they are allowed the oppurtunity to do, people have forgotten that people in Iraq are unable to voice their opinions freely.  In America, a country which happens to be more democratic than iraq, even a relatively justified move against Iraq resulted in widespread opposition from the American masses.  What does the fact that the American masses are allowed to make their voice heard show?<br><br>Lastly, consider Saddam's decision in placing military installations in civilian areas.  This very fact shows that he also knows that the US would not like to attack civilian targets.  Even the human shields wasting their bloody time camping in Iraq, they prey upon the US reluctance at incurring civilian casualties on that opposing side.  The fact that people think this strategies work shows that the US is rational and is carrying out a measured attack on Iraq.<br><br>If you are complaining about why the US invaded Iraq first instead of North Korea, read my original posting.</div>

The US initiated the UN for better security and cooperation in all countries of the world, but as the recent Gulf War shows, it only say but do not do.<br><br>Many countries have not backed the war, hence the US went into the war without a UN-backed resolution. Isn't this a scenerio of the Japan/Manchuria war? And in that fateful war, Japan also attacked Manchuria for the same purpose, to gain natural resources. Being the world's unrivalled superpower does not give it the right to do whatever it deem fit. Disobeying the wishes of the UN which the US so strongly wanted to form shows the disrespect and the arrongance the US shows.<br><br>Reasons for the war includes "mistreatment of civilians" , "weapons of mass destruction", and "collabration with the Al-Qaeda".All these so far have been disbunked except for the case of the "mistreatment of civilians". If this is the case, there is so many other countries ill-treating their civilians, to even worse extent than Iraq. For one example is N.Korea. Weapons of mass destruction. No concrete evidence has been given by the US, only words. Saying they have is not the same as PROVING they have.Again there is no evidence. And once again N.Korea has the WMD, but is under no prosecution by the US. It has regularly intruded into S.Korean airspace and has openly defied the US and the UN. Why is there no action taken against them? Al-Qaeda. again there is no concrete evidence. It's like saying Bush has a mistress,and prosecuted him for it though there is no evidence.<br><br>The US has incured the wrath of many people in the world with its arrogance and nonchalent attitude to the wishes of many people in the world. The Iraqi people has put up a brave fight so far. Why? They feel the US is invading them, Saddam has improved since the last Gulf War, and most importantly this IS THEIR LAND. No army has the right to come in and take over it by giving stupid reasons with no real evidence. I wish the Iraqi people the best in their struggle for freedom. The same freedom the US people prides so much on.</div>

Definitely longer than 3 months. The previous UNSC resolutions and weapons inspections ran for years, and were finally bearing results before Saddam kicked them out in 1998. Answer me this: Do you seriously think the couple of months between resolution 1441/arrival of inspectors and the war is anywhere near enough to properly inspect Iraq?<br><br>No, by allowing money to dictate their their policy of Iraq and admitting as much, France and Russia are showing CONSISTENCY. By talking about morals when your Iraq policy is all about money like the US, thats HYPOCRISY. Do you know the difference in meaning between the 2 words?<br><br>Did you actually even read my reasons for opposing this war as it is now? The US went to war WITHOUT a consensus. What kind of precedent are they setting? And whos next? Now anyone with a stronger military can march into their neighbours land on some lame pretext for "regime change" because of the wonderful example set by the US. With this geopolitical implication in mind, whos the real threat to world peace and stability? In case you still don't get it, let me repeat again:<br><br>I am opposed to a war against Iraq WITHOUT international consensus and PROPER PROOF of Iraqs wrongdoings. I will happily support a war when the above are adhered to.<br><br>And don't try to lecture me on how Saddam has mistreated his people and caused regional instability. I saw the news when he gassed the Revolutionary Guards and Halabja, I saw the newsclips of him invading Kuwait and his men line up Kuwaitis to be shot by the beachfront in Kuwait City. What were you doing then?<br><br>You talk about responsibility, spending on public etc etc as a condition for allowing a country to build nukes? So I suppose the good citizens of North Korea are well-fed, rich middle class folk and the government surplus is too high hence the government spends money on nukes?<br><br>So North Korea's spending on the military at the expense of its population is perfectly fine with you?<br><br>You say "Kim Jung Ill's possibility of rapidly building up a large military force is much lower than that of iraq's".<br><br>Really? And how pray tell did you arrive at the conclusion? Lets examine a few facts:<br><br>* North Korea's missiles are known to have a range of at least 800 miles, and it is already known that a newer version that can reach 1000. Saddams Al-Samoud(a locally modified SA-2 Guideline SAM) missiles have trouble reaching 200.<br><br>* Iraq has been under sanctions since 1991, making it difficult to smuggle weapons in. North Korea has no such problems giving it unfettered access to the market in WMD.<br><br>* Iraqs WMD program has been severely damaged in Desert Storm, and set back by a couple more limited military strikes since then, in addition to being subject to constant surveillance by U-2s and American satellites. N Korea's WMD program has been allowed to continued unmolested, save for the occasional satellite pass.<br><br>And Iraq's the bigger threat? Whatever it is that you've been smoking, stop before it does some REAL damage to your brain,</div>
