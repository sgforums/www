One very clear example of this pushing around is how the US would try to force countries which US servicemen and even have committed crimes in to evade trial, more than once citing a presumption that their citizens would not get a "free and fair" trial. Remember the rape of 12-year-old schoolgirl in Okinawa by Marines, the road accident in S Korea when 2 S Korean schoolgirls were killed, and closer to home how the US interfered in our trial of the American punk who vandalised cars, citing caning as "cruel and unusual" punishment? Whats that if not infringing other countries sovereignity and pushing other countries around?<br><br>No bad effects now, sure. But the potential is there.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>How the civillians the US have killed up to now and are going to kill will never reach anywhere near the sum Saddam totalled in the egomanicaial hell of his regime. And at least the allies are trying their best NOT to harm civvies, Saddam goes OUT OF HIS WAY to harm them during his reign just to make his backside a little more comfortable in his throne.<br><br>If the Arab nations were really concerned for the Iraqis and their brothers and wanted to do something intelligent about it, they should have disposed Saddam themselves rather then wait for some americans to do it.</div>
