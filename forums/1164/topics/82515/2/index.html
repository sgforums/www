            <div class='col-md body'>conscientious objectors such as JW have to serve military prison time. I had a fren in 21 SA and he told he that whenever he does guard duty, you can see them doing area-cleaning around the outside of Kranji DB area, such as cleaning out the garbage house. They will occasionally come to the guardroom to sign out for the garbage house key...Apparently, they sign "JW" under the rank column. He even ask them once how long they have to serve prison for, and apparently its for 3 yrs. They wear a different kind of prison attire however; white t-shirt and blue shorts. They also have no reservist man.. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br><br>I used to see them regularly last time when I booked in early at Kranji Camp through the 41 SAR/21 SA gates, before the order came down forbidding us to do so and I kena forced to walk the long, long way to the 3 Gds gate...knn   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cry.gif" alt="Crying or Very sad" title="Crying or Very sad"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Oh, I see now. &amp;, yes, the 3 Guards entrance was a quite long walk away to book in-book out, though personally I held that Amoy Quee Camp is comparatively farther (if your unit is sited within its deep reaches) ...<br><br>The old 21SA used to operate self-propelled mortars mounted inside the M113 - we were spiritually more Armour than Arty. The explosion wiped out the whole of Alpha Battery's Detachment 4, killing one &amp; rendering 4 permanent downgradees due to sharpnel injuries (the DC in the buttocks, the 2IC in the face, the layer's fingers blown off &amp; another mortarman in the back). Only the driver escaped unhurt.<br><br>The official investigation tracked it on the dead mortarman, who'd supposedly found a grenade &amp; hid it from the end-of-exercise oath-taking. I recall how, with the rest of my unit personnel, the conspirational theorists (who speculated if the truth died with the dead) &amp; lynch hunters (who wanted my BC &amp; CO charged, let alone the Chief of Arty &amp; other big shots who came down for the military funeral) were quickly put in their place - if only out of freaking respect for the departed.<br><br>It was, overall, quite a difficult time for us NSFs to get over. My PTSD was actually triggered off by a couple of sporting accidents when I was in NUS, but back then it did cause deep, deep philosophical conflict like what is life, is NS worth it, etc. (Hokkien peng-style, since we were all drawing sub-$200 salaries ~smile~).<br><br>As with the recent Commando incident, the foremost instinct was also to close ranks &amp; seek simplistic comfort in some sort of transcendal comradeship. That has its place - I'm human myself - but it won't, &amp; can't, hide the sinfullness of the deed. The dead mortarman was a great guy (one of the few Hokkien-peng taking the initiative to befriend the Air-Level arrivals) &amp; I'm sure he didn't mean to cause what he did, but I couldn't look the other injured guys in the eye &amp; not see their hurt or sense of wrongedness. I mean, I would've fought in any foxhole with him, but he was still a moron who caused serious casualties for an idiotic act.<br><br>But what's done was done. I felt for our BC (who darted into the M113 after our medic froze) &amp; hoped his career wasn't derailed - thankfully, saw his name a few years later in the National Day award list with a higher rank/staff appointment. I didn't ROD with my 21SA batch either due to the extra half-year &amp; then NUS, but read in Pioneer Magazine that they won Best Reservist Unit one year - so that's a pleasant surprise too.[/u]</div>
