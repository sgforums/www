              <p>Singapore will buy four Gulfstream G550 special mission business jets, configured for Airborne Early Warning missions. The aircraft will replace four Northrop Grumman E-2C Hawkeye aircraft currently in service. According to the Singapore MOD, the G550 AEW will be capable of flying 9 hours missions at an altitude of 41,000ft (12,500m). Singapore will receive the first aircraft by 2008, and all four are expected to be operational by 2010. While Singapore has not released further details about the electronic and radar suite to be installed in the aircraft, the only system currently available for this platform is the Israeli PHALCON radar, developed for four Israel Air Force G550 AEW aircraft known as <em><a href="/products/n/nachshon.htm"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0000ff;">Eitam</span></span></a></em>, currently being delivered by IAI/Elta. The first aircraft was handed over by Gulfstream on September 2006.</p>

              <p>JDW has reported that the first of five platforms will fly into Singapore during September 2008.</p>
              <p>Soon it will be mid-2008, anyone know with some degree of certainty when the first of these new AWACs will touch down into Singapore ?</p>
              <p>It seems that the present RSAF Hawkeyes has been flying reliably for the last 20 years, and will continue service until these Gulfstreams are operational in 2010.</p>
              <p>Meanwhile, the US Navy continue to develop the current AWAC platform into the Hawkeye 2000 series - with new electronic suites that allow a new class of carrier based AWACs to have some features found in the J-Star platforms, enabling these flying asset to track slow moving ground target.</p>
              <p>Its radar system is further enhanced to also augment the naval Aegis system, by providing an earlier warning to track hostile missile launches from land that threaten the Carrier Battle Group.</p>

              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">G550 features PHALCON AESA, which tops the performance of APS-139 of E-2C Hawkeye greatly. Understandable, the data processing ability of G550 should improve much as new DSP hardware frog leaped during the last decade.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;"> </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">However, I’d rather say the E-2C’s airframe is quite aged. What the most expensive part of AEWS is the Radar and sensor suite, CEC units rather than the airframe. If wanting to upgrade the old E-2C fleet to new E2-2000 standard, the only thing can save is the aged/cheap/yet unreliable airframe. Better retire the old E-2C after all. </span></p>

            <div class='col-md body'><p>Yep... I'm not sure if the US Navy is going to remanufacture the Hawkeyes during the upgrade, but that is definitely something we can't do, and the airframes are already so old. Anyway, we have only 4 aircraft to replace, unlike the US Navy, so we might as well get a new aircraft with better systems-- not to mention all the perks that we might get from ordering a similar package to the Israelis in terms of interoperability of equipment and upgrades, development of new electronic packages, etc.</p></div>

              <p>When we bought the E2C in the 1980s, there wasn't that many selection for AEWs.... other the the eastern bloc solution, there is only the E3 AWACS (super expensive) and the E2C... I think the IAF was operating E2C also...</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The E2C is carrier capabable and the USN needs a platform that can operate off the CVNs... and hence the upgrade program....</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>there are now solutions whereby the platform is based off a commerical a/c.... this will definitely result in lower operating cost (in terms of airframe and engines etc etc)....</p>

              <p>Anyway, which airbase did you spot a similar Gulfstream G550 jet at ?</p>
              <p>Since the E2C is operating out of Tengah, it is unlikely that the new AWACs will operate from another airbase.</p>
              <p>If you spot a similar Gulfstream taking off from another airbase, most likely it could be an executive jet flying in some US military brass or senior government staff on a short visit to Singapore. </p>
              <p>Reading some of the specs on the IAF Gulfstream fitted with their Phalcon AEW, if similar or enhanced version is fitted into the RSAF Gulfstream platforms - it will surely boost the operating effectiveness of the RSAF.</p>

              <p> If the assumed VIPs can get fried sitting in your observed White Gulfstream jet with external conformal parts - then the RSAF aircrew manning the Gulfstream AEW will be similarly fried.</p>
              <p>They will surely not taste like the western KFC, but more like local ''satay''.</p>
