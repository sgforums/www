            <div class='col-md body'>Just bought this revisionist history of the Battle of Midway.Only one word-brillant and awesome.It includes many technical stuff never revealed before such as IJN carrier doctrine-highly recommended for the hardcore naval buff.It is also fairly sympathetic to Nagumo and is highly critical of Yamamato.<br><br>It challenges 8 well known myths of the battle<br><br>1)The Americans triumphed against overwhelming odds at the Battle of Midway.<br><br>2)The Aleutians Operation was conceived by Admiral Yamamoto, the commander in chief of Combined Fleet, as a diversion designed to lure the American fleet out of Pearl Harbor.<br><br>2)During the transit to Midway, Admiral Yamamoto withheld important intelligence information from Admiral Nagumo, the operational commander of the carrier striking force. As a result, Nagumo was in the dark concerning the nature of the threat facing him.<br><br>3)Had the Japanese implemented a two-phase reconnaissance search on the morning of 4 June, they would have succeeded in locating the American fleet in time to win the battle.<br><br>4)The late launch of cruiser Tone's No. 4 scout plane doomed Admiral Nagumo to defeat in the battle.<br><br>5)Had Admiral Nagumo not decided to rearm his aircraft with land-attack weapons, he would have been in a position to attack the Americans as soon as they were discovered.<br><br>6)The sacrifice of USS Hornet's Torpedo Squadron Eight was not in vain, since it pulled the Japanese combat air patrol fighters down to sea level, thereby allowing the American dive-bombers to attack at 1020.<br><br>The book reached my place yesterday and I can't bring myself to put it down!

In other words,the flight decks were full of planes ready to launch.The book says this is rubbish-there were no bombers at all on the flight back when the US dive bombers attacked,only a few Zeros ready for the next Combat Air Patrol detail.<br><br>In other words, the painting below is historically inaccurate.<br><br><img src="http://img414.imageshack.us/img414/4002/turning8qo.jpg"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Thanks Marco on the head's up.<br><br>I've gone through the Combined Fleet webby and it does contain alot of useful information. Anyway, I checked out the games portion and saw them reccomending "Carriers at War" which is a very very old game based on naval battles, in fact, mainly naval carrier battles.<br><br>You know what, I've downloaded that and played it and it's really good fun. Nothing better than getting an unexpected enemy sortie when my CAP is on deck refueling...<br><br></div>

The Japanese knew what/how many aircraft each US carrier embarked, so if TBDs were attacking, the Dauntlesses could NOT be far behind. They should have allocated sufficient Zeros to CAP at higher altitudes. That might have saved them from annihilation.<br><br>Then again, I disagree vehemently with Yamamoto's dispersal of his forces, especially the carriers. Kido Butai's four fleet carriers (Akagi, Soryu, Kaga and Hiryu) had about 96 Zeros in total. No more than 50 were performing CAP at any one time, since the others had to escort their Vals and Kates to hit Midway. 50 Zeros to protect such a large inviting target?!<br><br>I'm a strong advocate of force concentration. The Aleutians maneuver was a big waste of time and resources. Had Yamamoto grouped Ryujo, Junyo, Hosho and Zuiho together with Kido Butai, Midway would most likely have resulted in a stunning Japanese victory. That said, had he waited until 5 or 6 fleet carriers were available and used them for the earlier Coral Sea operation, Shokaku and Zuikaku might've been available for the Midway operation.<br><br>The USN would've been dealt her gravest defeat in history. However, given US industrial might (almost TEN times that of Japan's), this would've merely postponed the inevitable, albeit by many many months ...<br><br></div>
