We can't possibly fight wars in air-conditioned areas, can we?'<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>Indoors fitness test runs 'too soft' </strong><br>Mindef hopes clubhouse IPPT tests will be more convenient, but NSmen worry image of Singapore soldiers will be hurt<br><strong><br>IT'S soft. It makes soldiers look silly.<br></strong><br>These were among the reactions of NSmen to a move to let them do their 2.4km run indoors, on treadmills.<br><br>Their main worry? It will turn out 'soft' soldiers.<br><br>The run, considered by many to be the toughest part of the Singapore Armed Forces' annual Individual Physical Proficiency Test (IPPT), is now done outdoors at stadium running tracks or selected SAF camps.<br><br>But for a trial year from Jan 5, NSmen can choose to run at Safra National Service Association clubhouses in Tampines and Toa Payoh. Their gyms are air-conditioned and have piped-in music.<br><br>NSman Melvin Tan, who is in his 20s, asked: 'Has the SAF gone soft? We can't possibly fight wars in air-conditioned areas, can we?<br><br>'Running on treadmills is quite different from running on uneven surfaces, which have slopes and the like.'<br><br>Former NS officer Chim Howe Lai, 51, said: 'We have to fight a war in our natural environment, not in an air-conditioned hall or gym.'<br><br>Others conceded that treadmill runs would help them, but they were still against it.<br><br>IT professional Goh Hung Kuang, 28, said: <strong>'Anything that makes the test easier for me is, of course, a good thing. But, ultimately, it's ridiculous.</strong><br><br>'To use treadmills and air-conditioning for a simple run is a bit much. A lot of things in the army depend on image and psychological effect, and <strong>something that is so comfort-centred can make soldiers look silly.'</strong><br><br>Regular joggers said that running on a treadmill is far easier than pounding on pavement.<br><br>But Safra president Cedric Foo, who broke news of the idea on Sunday, said convenience for NSmen was the main reason for the trial.<br><strong><br>The Minister of State for Defence did not address the 'softie' issue but said that treadmills would be adjusted 'to simulate...actual test conditions'.<br></strong><br>But even the convenience factor was doubted by some.<br><br>Each IPPT test can see 50 or more NSmen taking part. Since they run around a track or around the camp, all can start the run at the same time.<br><br>Safra said it will wheel in more treadmills during an IPPT test. Even so, the number that can be crammed into a gym is limited, so those taking the test may have to wait their turn.<br><br>NSmen have to complete their 2.4km run in under 15 minutes.<br><br>When contacted yesterday, the Ministry of Defence said it would address the issues raised by the NSmen soon.<br><br><a href="http://straitstimes.asia1.com.sg/topstories/story/0,4386,223141,00.html?" rel="nofollow">http://straitstimes.asia1.com.sg/topstories/story/0,4386,223141,00.html?</a><br><br>[/quote]<br><br>its heartening to see that most ppl r not for this silly idea.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"><br><br>hm.. mr foo again...  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_neutral.gif" alt="Neutral" title="Neutral"><br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Fitness test not a combat training activity<br><br>I REFER to the letter, 'Soldiers should train as they would fight' (ST, Dec 2), by Mr Chia Ying Chng and the article, 'Indoor fitness test runs 'too soft' ' (ST, Dec 3).<br><br>The Individual Physical Proficiency Test (IPPT) is a standard physical-fitness test comprising four static stations and a 2.4km run in T-shirt, shorts and track shoes. It is not conducted under field conditions and is not a combat training activity.<br><br>SAF servicemen are trained and conditioned for combat by undergoing a series of field exercises (in skeleton or full battle gear) and not by how they take their IPPT. The combat training the SAF puts soldiers through is compre-hensive, tough and realistic.<br><br>The 2.4km run on a treadmill in a Safra gym will require the performance standard and effort of an equivalent outdoor 2.4km run. The treadmill will have the gradient adjusted to compensate for the gym environment. This has been calibrated after careful study by the Defence Medical and Environmental Research Institute, working together with the Army's Training Department and Army Medical Staff.<br><br>The equivalent standard on the treadmill has been cross-validated by having servicemen perform both outdoor and treadmill tests. There is therefore no compromise on the IPPT standards.<br><br>The SAF offered NSmen the alternative of taking their 2.4km run in Safra gyms to make it more convenient for them. We recognise that NSmen have to balance demands on their time from their family, career and NS duties. Where we can make it more convenient for them to carry out their NS duties without compromising operational readiness, we will do so.<br><br>COL BERNARD TOH<br>Director, Public Affairs<br>Ministry of Defence<br><br></div>
