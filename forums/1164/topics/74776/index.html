            <div class='col-md body'>Don't worry about so much being a pioneer, its not as tough these days. Being posted to seletar means u have the possibilities of in the water bridging unit.<br><br>seletar also houses a guards unit and they also have infantry pioneer platoon. Infantry pioneer focus mainly on clearing obstacles and laying obstables. mostly sufficient for human to pass through only, not much of a heavy stuffs like bridging. Most of the time (i heard) infantry commanders don't know how to deploy infantry pioneers, so use them as labourers..  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br><br>anyway, getting hands or fingers chopped off is in the past when manual bridge like MGB and bailey bridge is around. I heard of ppl having their fingers chopped off when they lay the top panel of the MGB cos its super heavy that it can do that. these bridges have been phased out and not likely that u'll touch them.<br><br>Just keep your fingers where they are and don't anyhow poke them into any holes that u see and u should be fine.</div>

(nice game)<br><br>actually engineers dont just do mines, they do many things like boobytrapping, demolition, bridging, fortification countermobility and anything under the sun or moon, wet or dry, and still need to fight like infantry if required. whatever things a soldier dont/cant do they call the engineers. pioneers are the ones always going in first (and get killed), thats why they are called "Pioneers", and last one to come back.<br><br>looking at it, if there is a river/sea in front of a Division, they cant cross means they cant cross. be it the Division wanting to advance or retreat, there's nothing they can do about it.<br><br>who they gonna call?<br><br>engineers are indeed very respectable pple. you should feel damn proud about it. esp when pple ask about your vocation, they always shake their heads and say "siong" when you reply "engineers"...... ego boosted.</div>
