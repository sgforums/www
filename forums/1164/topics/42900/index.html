            <div class='col-md body'>Hi guys,<br><br>another really cool website about French Leclerc. Enjoy.<br><br><a href="http://www.kithobbyist.com/AFVInteriors/leclerc/leclerc1.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.kithobbyist.com/AFVInteriors/leclerc/leclerc1.html</a><br><br>Yet another site about Western MBTs...<br><br><strong>Big, Bad Battle Tanks</strong><br>Four of the world's most formidable tanks -- representing the UK, France, Germany, and the US -- are put to the test.<br><br>From Britain, the Challenger 2 tank has a 360-degree turning turret, an L30 gun that can fire eight rounds -- ammunition that includes armor piercing depleted uranium shells -- in 45 seconds. With a price tag of $5.5 million, and its relatively short attack range of 450 kilometers, FFM gives it an overall rating of six (out of 10).<br><br>Next up, from France, it's the Leclerc. While it's the only tank with an automatic loader in our test, it's still the slowest, firing at only six rounds per minute. Lighter and faster than the others, the Leclerc has a top speed of 75 kilometers per hour, and has a good attack range of 550 kilometers. The $7 million ticket, however, means an overall FFM rating of three.<br><br>The Germans bring us the Leopard 2 battle tank, a relative bargain at $4.5 million. The Leopard 2 is equipped with a long L55 firing gun, and can travel at a top speed of 72 kilometers per hour. It's also built with third-generation composite armor, which should help a crew of four survive a hostile encounter. The Leopard 2 gets an FFM rating of three.<br><br>Weighing in at 70 tons from the US, is the M1A2, a next-generation armored tank that helped the US win the Gulf War. At $5 million, it's not overly expensive. However, the parts are the most costly of the four tanks. The M1A2, which can travel at 72 kilometers per hour, is equipped with three machine guns and two smoke grenade launchers to mask it from enemy thermal imaging devices, and its cannons can fire three rounds in 12 seconds for a quick pounding. All in all, it garners a five FFM rating.<br><br><a href="http://www.techtv.com/futurefightingmachines/story/0,24330,3383178,00.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.techtv.com/futurefightingmachines/story/0,24330,3383178,00.html</a>[/b]</div>

            </div>
            <div class='col-md body'>Unfortunately a gizmozed T-72 with such an FCS ain't gonna cut it, these tanks have chronically underpowered guns, ammo and turret traverse and gun elevation rates. And that's gonna make the FCS pretty useless because while it can track the target, it can't lay the gun on the target itself as fast as let's say a power loaded Abrams turret. Almost any other modern tank can snap off a shot moving on far rougher terrain then the PT-91 tin can can. The addition of the FCS appears to be a little gizmo upgrade that while does somewhat improve the absymal accuracy of the tank against western tanks, it's actual effect is much less then the MAF would have liked to have seen.</div>

If you talk about the first 6 to 8 round burst in a minute for a human loader compared to the Leclerc 12 rounds per minute burst. I say, they are about the same.

            <div class='col-md body'>The americans did toy around with an autoloader for the M1A2, but they figured that a 19 year old with a strong arm was for the moment, a lot smarter and could help in the maintaining of the tank as well. An autoloader as to be fixed, and it can't scrub the gun barrel.</div>

Light tanks and MBTs each have their roles in battle. While a light tank will certainly not survive an engagement with an MBT, there are many things that it can do better:<br><br>1. There will be more of them for the same price. This means that they will be available for many more missions which it would be a waste to send MBTs on, such as convoy escorts or infantry support. They can also be everywhere on a battlefield, while MBTs need to be carefully hoarded.<br><br>2. They are smaller and can go more places than the MBTs (especially in closed terrain). Some are even parachute-droppable or helimobile. The first rule of a gunfight is to have a gun. If your huge MBT cannot get to the battleground, who cares how powerful it is?<br><br>3. They can perform the majority of armor missions as well as an MBT. The only armor mission they are worse at is antitank combat. They can support the infantry, exploit breakthroughs, perform assaults, raids and economy of force missions just as well or better than MBTs.<br><br>4. They are logistically easier to support. This means they can keep up a higher tempo of operations all else being equal. Again, this leads to more missions completed, and more tanks on the ground.<br><br>This leads to light tanks and MBTs having totally different jobs in war. MBTs cannot do everything a light tank can, and vice versa. Do not forget how the Germans used tanks. The light tanks were used when they were in the Blitzkrieg years, while the heavy Tigers only came out when they were defending against the final Allied push.<br><br>Due to their great power but small numbers and high logistical cost, MBTs need to be marshalled to centres of gravity, either striking en masse at the opponent's, or defending one's own. Given the local terrain, using MBTs on the attack is very difficult, so the latter role is more likely. Light tanks should instead roam the battlefield in packs, attacking flanks and targets of opportunity, only occasionally gathering to exploit breakthroughs or strike vital targets. Light tanks will probably be on the attack in the local terrain.<br><br>Of course, the other part about this region not having MBTs is also wrong. One country has had them for 30 years: Singapore. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"></div>

I think the Type 90 MBT was based on the German Leopard 2 design with an auto-loader. Even their IFV are pretty interesting.</div>
