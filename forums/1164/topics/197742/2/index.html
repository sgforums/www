            <div class='col-md body'>The person who decided that the SAR-21 should not be able to use M-16 magazines burnt a lot of bridges. I just can't imagine what advantage there is in taking such a drastic step.<br><br>And now that they find that it is impractical to mount a M203 on the SAR-21 (or for whatever reasons), we now have a silly situation in the rifle companies with SAR-21, M16/M203 and Ultimax SAW. The last 2 uses M-16 mags but not the SAR-21.<br><br>At the same time they also decided that the SAR-21 doesn't need good iron sights or a bayonet.<br><br>Just to have a weapon shorter than the M-16, we traded it for a weapon that's heavier, bad ergonomics, no useful iron sights, expensive, no bayonet, no magazine commonality with SAW and M16/M203, no grenade launcher, not suitable for lefties.<br><br>I served in the infanrty and am of average height of 1.73m. I never once found the M-16 to be too long. And everyday I used the M-16, I appreciated its accuracy, light weight, balance and great ergonomics.<br><br>I'm afraid we might soon find out for ourselves why Malaysia decided to switch back to the M-16/M-4 after a decade with the Steyr AUG bullpup.<br><br>I think the most urgent thing for the army is to address all these problems with the SAR-21.</div>

Which we have A4SU Super Skyhawks, F5E Tigers and F16A/B Vipers...<br><br>Now that RSAF phased out A4SU Super Skyhawks, as a need to balance the various ground strike roles, interceptor roles and advanced air strike roles and not over burdening our current fleet of F5E Tigers anf F16 Vipers, further variants of F16C/D Blk 52+ Vipers were procured, giving the Vipers multi-roles, multi-operations fighter... F15SG Eagles are purchased as their air &amp; ground strike capabilities were proven to complement the Vipers, thus leaving F5E for interceptor roles...</div>
