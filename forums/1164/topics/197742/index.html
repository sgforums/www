            <div class='col-md body'>hey folks, wad do u all think is the most immediate need to be replaced or purchase to enhance our land forces? other than our old, and ageing AMX-13, wad other things do u see as the most pressing needs or wad do u wish to see ST engg produce for the army. For me, I hope they can get a local design, breech loaded version of a MAW to replace our 84mm. The weight should preferbly 10kg plus minus and do not rust that much. A GPMG is also needed as our FN GPMG are most old and quite heavy. For me, it should be ideally at around 9 kg. wad are ur thoughts? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>

The newer variant is lighter than the one we are currently using.<br><br>The I-HAWK and the Rapier should be replaced soon too.

I realised that our current fighter force has been reduced by the retirement of older types and new ones not being bought in sufficient numbers. Of course, the expected argument is that " An advanced warplane can do the job of 2 or more older ones " I beg to differ. This argument is true ASSUMING that your potential adversaries remain at a particular technological level and do not purchase any new equipment at all! In fact, this was highlighted by the Royal Australian Air Force, which stated that while the F-35 was an advanced 5th Generation aircraft, the projected buy of 60 warplanes would barely be sufficient to maintain the edge given by the current combined fleet of (100+) F-111s and F/A-18s.<br><br>For instance 20 - 40 F-15Ts to replace 68 A-4/TA-4SUs appear completely reasonable at first. Not so when we take into account the rising numbers of Sukhoi Su-27s and its advanced variants entering service in the region. Add to the fact that it is extremly difficult to have a 100% flyable fleet due to equipment failure or maintanance, a sufficient fleet size must thus be maintained.<br><br>After adding all warplanes locally based, overseas detachments and even those on order, I estimate the RSAF frontline fighter fleet to be over 130 warplanes. (TA-SUs and S211s not included as these are considered secondary combat assets) However, if the F-5s are retired before any replacement aircraft enter service, the RSAF fighter fleet may drop below 100 aircraft, a situation we have never been in since the late 70s.<br><br>Of course, these are my personal views. For all we know, the RSAF may have enough aircraft in storage to nearly double our strength in times of emergency. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>
