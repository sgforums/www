"The USA has looked at the Future Combat System [FCS] and we find that to be an attractive idea. We can explore along a similar line."

Not to mention, with the new rounds from the AK74 and the SS109 bullet from the later model M16s version, penetration is supposed to be better.

            <div class='col-md body'>Yes, no doubt in a FIBUA/CQB environment Speed is Life, protection is too.Anyway,the vest need not be that heavy,it can be modular and be able to hold inserts such as ceramic plates,steel plates etc. Lets say in a low risk environment, we'll use the armour without inserts, in a high risk environment, we'll up the inserts. Won't that be of better?

DID has covered the USA's M1117 Guardian ASVs, with orders numbering over 1,200 and production resuming in Hurricane Katrina's wake. We've also covered Iraq and Britain's acquisition of Force Protection's Cougar variants, Belgium's buys of Dingo and Iveco Panther vehicles as the mainstays of its future fleet, Canada's emergency buy of RG-31 Nyalas, Denmark's order for MOWAG Eagle IV vehicles (no longer HMMWV-based like the Eagle III) and Duro trucks, Germany's additional purchases of KMW Dingo 2 vehicles, and Israel's potential purchase of same; and Norway's emergency procurement of Iveco Panthers.<br><br></blockquote><a href="http://" rel="nofollow"></a><a href="http://" rel="nofollow"></a></div>
