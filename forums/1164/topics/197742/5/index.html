You are told off because your understanding of war is shallow and childish.<br><br>If u were really targeting the belly, there is another option. its called an A-T mine. Hizbollah just proved over the past week that it works even against Israeli Merkavas. They didn't even need RPGs...<br><br>The organic infantry section IS pretty weak in a heavy anti-tank role. The reason is because THEY WERE NEVER MEANT TO BE USED AGAINST HEAVY ARMOUR.<br><br>The organic infantry section is also pretty weak in an anti-air role for the same reason. Even if u saw a low flying jet, no one expects u to whip an Igla outta your arse to shoot at it.<br><br>What is the point of arming soldiers to fight enemies they were never intended to fight? the excess metal becomes dead weight and will only get in the way.<br><br>There are other options available.<br><br>Besides, if u actually bashed headlong into an enemy tank platoon, you must be really deaf to let that happen cos i cannot imagine how you could not have heard them from miles away...<br><br>You CANNOT not hear a tank platoon... that gives u more than enough time to consider your options and call in back-up if needs be.<br><br>I think everyone appreciate your attempts at intellectual conversation, but i really do wish that you would moderate your tone. You are excessively condescending for no good reasons.<br><br>And while it is tempting to say that we ought to just arm every trooper with an RPG, you have to be aware of a few things: one more piece of equipment brought to the field is one less piece you could have carried with you.<br><br>The trade-off could be food, water, ammunition, communication, optics and most importantly, field endurance. A soldier that just trudged 20+ clicks with a full combat load and an RPG isn't in much fit shape to do much else... We're not supermen. Now, if your RPG fits in my SBO pouch, i don't mind...<br><br>And as i mentioned, tanks don't move quietly. And they are mostly road bound. You can try using them to bash through thick jungle but if time is of the essence, you wouldn't.<br><br>So what is the point of arming troopers with RPGs again? when with superior intelligence and convergence, you know where the tanks are gonna be and u can despatch superior assets to deal with them?<br><br>War is not fought with isolated weapon platforms.<br><br>There is a perceived gap in SAF's armour. That, we have known for years... Can the problem be solved if u gave every trooper an RPG? or if u bought a boatload of flashy new heavy tanks? i don't think so...<br><br>So lets not over-simplify the problem shall we?</div>

You are told off because your understanding of war is shallow and childish.<br><br>If u were really targeting the belly, there is another option. its called an A-T mine. Hizbollah just proved over the past week that it works even against Israeli Merkavas. They didn't even need RPGs...<br><br>The organic infantry section IS pretty weak in a heavy anti-tank role. The reason is because THEY WERE NEVER MEANT TO BE USED AGAINST HEAVY ARMOUR.<br><br>The organic infantry section is also pretty weak in an anti-air role for the same reason. Even if u saw a low flying jet, no one expects u to whip an Igla outta your arse to shoot at it.<br><br>What is the point of arming soldiers to fight enemies they were never intended to fight? the excess metal becomes dead weight and will only get in the way.<br><br>There are other options available.<br><br>Besides, if u actually bashed headlong into an enemy tank platoon, you must be really deaf to let that happen cos i cannot imagine how you could not have heard them from miles away...<br><br>You CANNOT not hear a tank platoon... that gives u more than enough time to consider your options and call in back-up if needs be.<br><br>I think everyone appreciate your attempts at intellectual conversation, but i really do wish that you would moderate your tone. You are excessively condescending for no good reasons.<br><br>And while it is tempting to say that we ought to just arm every trooper with an RPG, you have to be aware of a few things: one more piece of equipment brought to the field is one less piece you could have carried with you.<br><br>The trade-off could be food, water, ammunition, communication, optics and most importantly, field endurance. A soldier that just trudged 20+ clicks with a full combat load and an RPG isn't in much fit shape to do much else... We're not supermen. Now, if your RPG fits in my SBO pouch, i don't mind...<br><br>And as i mentioned, tanks don't move quietly. And they are mostly road bound. You can try using them to bash through thick jungle but if time is of the essence, you wouldn't.<br><br>So what is the point of arming troopers with RPGs again? when with superior intelligence and convergence, you know where the tanks are gonna be and u can despatch superior assets to deal with them?<br><br>War is not fought with isolated weapon platforms.<br><br>There is a perceived gap in SAF's armour. That, we have known for years... Can the problem be solved if u gave every trooper an RPG? or if u bought a boatload of flashy new heavy tanks? i don't think so...<br><br>So lets not over-simplify the problem shall we?</div></blockquote>Thank you.  Glad someone else pointed out his "intellectual" mistakes.<br><br>Btw, four-niner, I wasn't disqualifying from this thread because you haven't served NS.  I was just pointing out that if you want to make suggestions to the SAF, it might be a good idea to really know what the SAF is doing.  Your ignoring the Spike and Milan capabilities is a glaring oversight.  Amongst other things that were correctly pointed out CX (thanks!).<br><br>You have every right to contribute.

            <div class='col-md body'>Frankly,I did say that we need body armour for our Army most. Though its not a weapon, I did say that's the most important. Though its costly, the spending on body armour is the same rationale on why SOF/CDO etc...will be tasked to rescue downed pilots in war.</div>
