Just 'cos we have 300 SM1 tanks doesn't mean we have to replace all 300 with MBTs.  I'm no expert but I would think that 100 MBTs with perhaps another 100 new light tanks would suffice.

            <div class='col-md body'>Actually the Malaysian army is equipped with RPG-7 which is of Pakistani origin. One infantry section have 2 RPG gunners. Now that will provide a very serious threat to our armoured forces especially the softer skin ones.<br><br>Maybe Singapore should seriously consider buying the right and technology to produce RPG launchers and rockets locally. After all this supposely cheap and crude weapon have claim many victims from the high-tech US military, both in Afganistan and Iraq. RPG weapon system have many types of rockets for a variety of targets. I think it could be used to replace the heavier and cumbersome 84mm.<br><br>I believe Russian and Eastern bloc military technology should be considered as well as Western ones.

Just 'cos we have 300 SM1 tanks doesn't mean we have to replace all 300 with MBTs.  I'm no expert but I would think that <span style="color: orange;">100 MBTs with perhaps another 100 new light tanks </span>would suffice.  After all we do have other armoured vehicles too.<br><br>Its just like the A4 Skyhawks.  I don't think RSAF intends to replace the exact number of Skyhawks with the exact number of F-15s.</div></blockquote>That would be inadequate to equip all our armoured regiments. And we must bear in mind that the threat environment from armour in other Asian countries has increased as well. Buying 300-500 new 120mm equipped light tanks should not be a problem as well. In fact these should cost much less than the planned (eventual) 40 or so F-15SGs. These would be a welcome addition to the around 100 MBTs we have according to unofficial sources such as Jane's. However, just 100 new light tanks would be sorely inadequate against an experienced and determined foe equipped with large numbers of ATGWs and other anti-armour weapons.</div>
