            <div class='col-md body'>I think the scope of the recent Israel-Hezbollah "engagement" has expanded out of Lebanon.  This thread will deal with further updates on the middle east situation.<br><br>Latest news:<br><br><strong>Israel Finds Evidence That Syria, Iran Arm Hezbollah With Russian Weapons</strong><br><br>Mosnews<br>Wed, 16 Aug 2006, 01:04<br><br><a href="http://www.defencetalk.com/news/publish/Israel_Finds_Evidence_That_Syria_Iran_Arm_Hezbollah_With_Russian_Weapons.php" rel="nofollow">http://www.defencetalk.com/news/publish/Israel_Finds_Evidence_That_Syria_Iran_Arm_Hezbollah_With_Russian_Weapons.php</a><br><br>This is the first hard evidence officially linking Syrian arms to Hezbollah, dug up by the Israelis since the conflict began.  There is a possibility of further conflict between Syria,  Iran, (Hezbollah) and Israel, and very highly likely, involvment of US Forces in the region.<br><br></div>

And the way I see it, the kidnapping of the corporal happened to provide a strong pretext for invading Lebanon and engaging Hezbollah head-on.<br><br>Otherwise, I don't see how they're going to convince their own people as well as the world of the necessity of violating another country's sovereignity without a good enough pretext. With the kidnapping though, it's far easier to tell their people that 'we're getting that boy back' and to tell the world of the danger of Hezbollah.<br><br>Don't get me wrong; I'm not condoning what Hezbollah did. It was an act of cowardice on their part to be kidnapping people and hiding among the civillian populace. However, the way I see it, rescuing the corporal became secondary to destroying Hezbollah - and the Israelis failed on both counts.</div>
