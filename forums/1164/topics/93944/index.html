Currently no budget airlines is going to Libya as I know.<br>2. Budget airlines don't ferry heavy equipments like tanks and artillery, you still need specialized equipments to ferry them over, like C-130. Or do you intend to over-run the country with infantry only?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br>3. You think such a mass deployment of men and equipment would go un-noticed by any country? They will probably just shot down the airplanes with all our men on it, and the invasion would be over before it even began.<br><br>Wait till you go into the military, you see. Deployment of men and equipments don't just happen at a snap, meticulous planning is required and that's very time-consuming. It's not like C&amp;C where you can move/attack/defend with just a click of the mouse.<br><br>Lastly, the Rambo-type hero you are looking for only exists in the movies. Chionging alone into enemy lines gets you killed 99.99% of the time in the real world, unless you are so damn incredibly lucky that every bullet shot at you missed, or you are invisible and the enemy can't see you in the first place.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_eek.gif" alt="Shocked" title="Shocked"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Try spending a saturday night just being part of an ambush against some imaginary enemy in Lim Chu Kang or moving with heavy fieldpacks for kilometers before attacking a useless objective filled with trees and other obstacles soaking wet because of the rain. I spent 3 years doing this and i still feel i havent learnt enough to go to actual combat. You think its worth sending our boys to some fight overseas jut for the sake of "combat experience". Are you willing to so? Oh i forgot.. you havent even learnt how to even draw arms yet. so in the meanwhile dont bother us with your bull and go back and play counterstrike and rainbow six till the shock of being a conscripted soldier with low pay hits you in mths/years time</div>
