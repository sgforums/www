            <div class='col-md body'>Im not with the idea of senting troops regularly to overseas for gaining experience in battles unnecessarily,however tvdog from what you say, must as while deem SAF as a useless piece of shit if you are not confident that we can fight murderous troops in all those countries as you listed. You are right by saying Caesar is over confident, however you are under estimating our armed forces.<br><br>Singapore have not fight any battle for 40 years so how sure are you that we cant be as brutal as aggressive as the troops of our enemy? The Malay Regimental soldiers in Singapore are all green horns as while as most of the Japanese soldiers in Manchuria, isnt it still so that the two soldiers fought fearlessly and brutally in Singapore and manchuria respectively?<br><br>When you throw a well trained soldier into a hostile environment, it is likely that he is going to fight brutally, not for his country but for himself. The love for life, can never be estimated (over or under). It is a fact that any well trained soldier will be better off with technological gadgets, same goes to the USMC as well as the VietCong. However why history have shown again and again that well trained technological savvy soldiers might not always win?<br><br>Is it because technology blind people? Or well trained Soldiers are not as efficient as murderous soldiers? Well is the answer lies in between. The fault is with tactics, not exactly not technology nor training. The american soldiers were well trained in the art of killing and were equipped with the best technology, however they lost their match to the Congs because of the wrong adoption of tactics. However the Americans with the same properties won the Japanese eventhough the Japs were as brutal because of the adoption of right tactics.<br><br>Thus i see that Singapore with all our technology and training will be at a lost if we adopt the wrong tactics and vice versa, we will be at advantage if we use the right tactics in war. I dont know whether do we have the tactics to win those rag tag soldiers as while as their ability to win us.<br><br>To those who think that SAF without experiences is in deep shit:<br><br>Since with the right tactics, why shouldnt we confidently go to war unnecessarily? The thing that i identify is, why should we give in to chances? Why should we allow chance to take away our brothers, sisters, husband, wife and children while fighting a war that is none of our business, just to show how garang our SAF can be?<br><br>Would you say that the MAF is highly efficient and garang because of the fighting in Somalia market? If you think so, you are a fool. Would you say that the US army is not efficient because of her setback in Iraq? If you think so, you are a greater fool. Then what is the Israeli Armed forces with their victories in all the wars except for LIC?<br><br>If Malaysia will to hold her feet further, not falling back, their proud 'victory' in Somalia will turn into annual national mourn. If US army will to leave iraq after winning the battle and not hold her foot there, US army will not suffer so many setbacks and probably less people will think that the US army is not efficient.<br><br>So my point is, senting soldiers to fight skirmishes, low intensity conflicts in theartres none of our bloody business, doesnt prove anything. In fact, only when a total war in your homeland occur, where the purpose of winning the war strikes the heart of all soldiers that prove something.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>It seems that the thread-starter's intention is to provoke an extreme response. I have little respect for for such a person if he truly believes in what he espouses. I do wish he gains greater insight later on in his life. Such foolishness is aggravating.<br><br>Does the SAF really need the combat experience? What do we define as that? We do enough studying of other nation's or army's mistakes and history. Is such theoretical knowledge not enough?<br><br>I personally find it tasteless if we intend to do it as a means to "test" our resolve or techniques. There is only 1 litmus test, the battlefield. But this test is very unforgiving and is ultimately the wrong option, it teaches us nothing which we already know about ourselves.<br><br></div>
