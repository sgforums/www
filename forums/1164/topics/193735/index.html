            <div class='col-md body'>I found myself bitten by the AR pistol bug recently, and decided to put one together using parts left over from my previous AR rifle builds. The only new parts that I had to order were the pistol-length barrel (in this case, 10.5 inches), buffer tube and adjustable gas block. The results:<br><br><img src="http://i57.photobucket.com/albums/g236/screwthepap2/AR_Pistol_01.jpg"><br><br><img src="http://i57.photobucket.com/albums/g236/screwthepap2/AR_Pistol_02.jpg"><br><br>I would have completed the build earlier, but the gas block was on backorder for quite a while, and it arrived just yesteday. If the weather cooperates tomorrow morning, I'll be taking it to the gun club's outdoor range for its initial firing.<br><br>Hope the bloody thing doesn't blow up! <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br></div>

From what I have seen, an AR15 pistol is usually held like a handgun with both palms wrapped around the grip (extremely awkward, as the gun is very front-heavy), or somewhat like a rifle, with the support hand holding the handguards and the cheek against the side of the buffer tube (also very awkward as the tube doesn't extend far enough back to rest on the shoulder).<br><br>As you can see, the AR15 pistol is a thoroughly impractical concept: it is too large and unwieldy as a handgun. However, it <span style="font-style: italic;">is</span> a blast to shoot, as a rifle cartridge shot out of a short barrel does not give the powder enough time to burn completely within the barrel, resulting in a HUGE fireball when the projectile exits the barrel!<br><br>I shall see how it performs at the range later this morning. If, for whatever reason, I do not like it, I can always convert it to a conventional rifle. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>holding the grip in 2 hands might work if u have strong arms and hands. But the recoil will definitely cause the "pistol" to jump tremendously.<br><br>a normal recoil on the M16 is enough to give my right cheek a slight bruise. i wouldn't want to imagine the aftereffects of the recoil for this "pistol"<br>either  u are gonna be shooting the birds or maybe some sheep/cow off in the distance on a hill..</div>

Mine always tear up the bolt after a 1 to 2 thousand rounds! the bolt just crack!....<br><br>GO the SBR on the rifle ! it would be better if it comes with a collapsable stock  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_twisted.gif" alt="Twisted Evil" title="Twisted Evil"><br><br>DaveC</div></blockquote>Actually, with the exception of the somewhat longer (for a pistol, that is) barrel, I wanted to keep it as compact and light as possible. A good forward grip would require some sort of free-floating handguard for a solid mount, and that would just add weight.<br><br>Did you by any chance get your short-barreled AR from an outfit called Model 1 Sales? They're notorious for using non-milspec parts in their builds, and almost everyone who has purchases a pistol upper from them eventually reports a broken bolt.<br><br>I put an extra-strength buffer spring in it to help deal with the higher bolt carrier velocities inherent in a pistol setup; I'm also shooting reduced-power handloads (55 gr. projectiles, with a measured muzzle velocity of around 1900 fps) to mitigate the battering. That seems to be working so far as I have not noticed any unusual wear in any of the parts.</div>
