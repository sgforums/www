              <p>Hmm I called him last night to ask more details about the planned game on 18th since he asked me to do so in his email to me. In his email he also gave the contact number of a person named Bob but that number also cannot get through, doesn't seem to exist. We talked for a while before he said he had a 2nd line and will call me back.</p>
              <p>When he called me back he started accusing me of recording the call when all I did was ask him to hold on while I switch to my Bluetooth headset. He even started abusing me with vulgar language like F**K. Like huh wth?</p>
              <p>Anyway I discussed with my friends who were interested to go for the game and we think that PtePinkY doesn't seem to be very trustworthy. During our phone conversation I asked him if he could provide photos of the previous game to prove that it really happened cos my friends' parents quite dubious cos its in batam and not locally, but PtePinky gave some excuse that he cannot cos he'll get into trouble with Mindef.</p>
              <p>Also I just read the links (and forwarded to my friends) that Lard Dummy posted and we kinda agree that PtePinkY has some serious character defects man. So I think all 8 of us won't be going for the game already. This sounds too much like a scam, especially if he's so worried about someone recording the phone conversation.</p>

              <p>okay. i shall say this one last time. i do not collect cash in any form.</p>
              <p>the money mentioned in this post are to be paid to the operator after the game and i am not collecting a single cent.</p>
              <p>ferry tickets, like wise. pay it to the ferry company yourself.</p>
              <p>for picture wise, i cant provide any for the moment since our good friend LD is creating some shit for me on Mindef.</p>
              <p>for the recording part, why would a normal person record a conversation? i am sure of it since there was a beep every 5-10 seconds? to be an evidence against me to mindef? sorry buddy. i am careful on the game plan to avoid any more trouble with mindef.</p>
              <p>if a scam refering to scaming u to batam and kidnap you?</p>

              <p>Sorry to everyone for repeat msg .. something wrong with my comp.</p>
              <p>Anyway , I don't know what you ( Dawn ) are up to ..  And my friends and I don't intend to risk anything to find out more about you.</p>
              <p>And for your info , everyone who uses a bluetooth headset will know that there will be beeps when you select settings. Mine was a new phone and I was unfamiliar with the settings.</p>
              <p>I guess you have something against your own conscience that makes you afraid and cautious. So please note that my friends and I are not going for the 18th game anymore. Good luck with your Mindef trouble.</p>
