              <p>The airsoft wargame in Batam was a success! And the next game is planned. The charges for the last game were S$50 not S$70. Sorry for the wrong information on the previous thread. The exccess were refunded to the players at the end of the game. Total expenses on average is S$105(The ferry and taxes cost S$48) and extra bbs shared.</p>
              <p>Lets ignore LardDummy since i have confrmed his identity as a competor which leads wargames overseas.</p>
              <p>Due to the high demand, 26 players turned up for the game.</p>
              <p>This game, we are going for a FIBUA instead of CQB.</p>
              <p><br>Date: 18 January 2009</p>
              <p>Time: 7.30am</p>
              <p>Meeting place: Habour front ferry terminal</p>
              <p>Price: S$50 for transportation to and fro game site from batam waterfront city, 200bbs, airsoft guns(ak47 or mp5A4/5), protective clothings, and mask or goggles. S$47 for ferry tickets and taxes.</p>
              <p>Extra bbs at S$15 for 1500 bbs</p>
              <p>Game is limited to 50 players. 17 confrmed players currently.</p>
              <p>Again, its for hobby, not for profits unlike some greedy operators who want to monopolise.</p>

              <p>haha gotta clarify for this. I am a guy and 100% straight. ask my dad why Dawn.</p>
              <p>And for pinky, that has a long story to go with.</p>
              <p>This will be a light forested area, not just CQB.</p>
              <p>gotta clarify that i have not been to this new place but its the same operator we went with for the CQB.</p>
              <p>Fight would usually be around 30 mins to 1 hour? depending on players and tactics actually.</p>
              <p>If we want a bigger game, we could invite indonesian players. But one very big advantage is that they are usng their personal guns which could get up to 600fps.</p>

              <p>Hi Pinky,</p>
              <p>How are you, I am back from my holiday and I feel GOOD! Sounds like you had a lot of fun in Batam. I donno why you think I am a competitor who brings groups to batam for airsoft. Got such operator meh?</p>
              <p>Pinky ar Pinky. First you accuse me of being "Mr A*****Y K**O, if i am not wrong or call sign A*****N, it is
                                      you." now I am a airsoft operator. Who will i be next, Santa Clause? 2009 coming liao, we be friends again ok?</p>
              <p>BUt hor, I still don't have any interest to play airsoft with you la. I already said in my previous posting that I wanted to find out how much the game cost. I really have no interest to go with you ok?</p>
              <p>And post the pictures ok? Let us what the setup is. You already recovered from your leg operation and no more on MC correct? So why not show the pictures, you can mark out the heads of the players to protect their privacy. Or if their privacy is so important then you post your own picture lo. Come lah dont shy.</p>
              <p>The 26 who played, got any feedback or not? Tell us shiok or not le.</p>

              <p>Now I m a "mr chong"? hahaha whatever you say :)</p>
              <p>Pinky, are you in trouble with Mindef again? You mean that
              instead of going DB again, they are just going to kick you out? If "mr
              chong" is the person responsible for you being able to finish your NS
              days earlier, you should be thanking him.</p>
              <p>Yes, Pinky was sent to the Dentention Barracks in 2008. Pinky even
              has a police record and was in IMH for a while cause he pretended to be
              crazy (that was the reason Pinky gave us, true or not I cant say) to
              get a lighter sentence. I heard recently that the police visited his
              house.</p>
              <p>Pinky, do you really want me to list down all the bad things you
              have done to people in the past? Because I can get the victims to come
              forward to tell everyone about their experience with you.</p>
              <p>To
              Jetson and Ho Sei Bo, I leave it to you guys to think about who you
              want to trust. I have nothing to gain from revealing all these facts. I
              know a lot of readers will say I m kaypo. But let me give you an
              example, if you know someone has cheated in the past and you see the
              same pattern again, will you not try to sound out a warning?</p>
              <p>Having
              seen the many things Pinky has done to so many people, it will be
              irresponsible of me to stay quiet. If I have to be the bad person here
              because I m trying to do the right thing, then I will just be The Dark
              Knight.</p>

              <p>well, the mouth is yours and you have all rights to say all you'd want.</p>
              <p>yup. thanks to you trouble with mindef. if you're able to get me out of my ns days, i will be damn happy. but this is not the case.</p>
              <p>detention barracks in 2008, i think you would want to refer to stomp. And for police record and imh? do you have any evidence in saying that i have been there? i believe that you should go there for a check up for your non stop imagination of this.</p>
              <p>and for the bad things i have done to the people in the past, go ahead. humans do make mistake. and you'd refer to victims, go ahead. get them to share!</p>
              <p>and wait, you were refering me on cheating? hey. get things right NOW!</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>And by the way, you are just not happy that i am playing laser tag with another operator, organising paintball and airsoft at cost. There is no such thing as monopolise here. You want to make your money, i want to have fun.</p>
              <p>You want to frame me, go ahead. Looking for 1001 excuses and trying to get mindef to screw me? I abide the law and the law aint gonna touch me. Lets see... Making a false report... hmm?</p>

              <p>Will get the pics up soon(i hope thanks to Mr chong aka xterix).</p>
              <p>No choice with the bbs. Thats what they quote. But the enterance fees seemed high since they are only providing bdus(no 4 la actually), mask, guns, transport to and fro the jetty to gamesite.</p>
              <p>$15 for 1500bbs i think would be reasonable in batam(since a packet cost of 3500 S$12 in hk without shipping) and their own mark up. cant compare the prices with hk right?</p>
              <p>and i believe that they are using .20g japanses bbs. the last time, they were using ksc.</p>

              <p>Alright :)</p>
              <p>Well, that's the nearest proximity to singapore where u can play airsoft. If its really fun to play there, then i guess it shld be worth it. I could bring my own gear for the game right? Save maybe customs might question thats all...</p>

              <p>Hi Moonstriker,</p>
              <p>I
              have no issues with Pinky organising airsoft games. I m not an airsoft
              operator and as I mentioned, I have nothing to gain from whether he
              organises airsoft games or not. I dont really care if Pinky plays with
              operator A or operator B because once again, I m not an operator. I do
              know for a fact that he was kicked out from an airsoft club and I can assure you that no one in that club is unhappy that he has moved on to another operator.</p>
              <p>Pinky
              thinks he knows who I m just because I said I would report him to
              Mindef for playing airsoft while he is on long MC after recovering from
              a leg operation and coincidentally it seems someone else did report
              this fact to Mindef.</p>
              <p>With regards to his past record, I think you may appreciate this
              more than the local Singaporeans here since you are studying in the US.
              You may be aware that sex offenders in the US are required to disclose
              their past and are not allowed to be in close proximity to places where
              children frequent. The rationale for this is to create a safe zone for
              children and to let parents be aware of potential dangers. Having said
              that, I suppose as normal civilians, we will never get a chance to
              confirm another person's criminal record so I will withdraw what I said
              about Pinky having been sent to jail and having stayed in IMH.</p>
              <p>And since it appears that my posts are unwelcomed, I will cease posting from
              here on. I wish all of you guys luck in associating with pinky. If he
              has changed, good for him. If he is still the same old person he has
              always been, well, dont say you werent warned :)</p>
              <p>By the way, this was the last post on his blog.</p>
              <p>http://jon-oceannut.blog.friendster.com/2008/10/damn-law-that-got-no-eyes/</p>
              <p>"Damn! Got into trouble by the stupid law again. I still gotta say
              its not totally my fault just like the one 4733 case last january. My
              buds know what it actually ment la. Dont wanna go into details.</p>
              <p>Dear came just now. Wanna fry some beehoon since am really
              financially dry already. Then some shit happend and the cops are
              comming. Damn! Time to run!</p>
              <p>I ment to limp!</p>
              <p>So limped to the nearby park and spoke to dear. As the speaking go
              by, i got to know dear even more than i ever had for the past almost 2
              months i got to know her.</p>
              <p>Got back 2 hours later and the cops are long gone. So heck them la!"</p>
