            <div class='col-md body'>I don't think SAF should learn too much and adopt whatever tactics and strategies from these American Experience wholesale.  In Mogadishu and Iraq, the Americans were engaged in COIN ops. They were not engaged against another professionally trained military.<br><br>Whatever improvements and implementations they have made MAY only be applicable to fighting ill trained insurgents.<br><br>In actual FIBUA action against another military, we won't be seeing rag tag militia men shooting out of windows on their own, or just be popping an RPG every now and then.   The intensity of firepower brought on would be ten fold and more accurate. Instead of AK pot shots, it would be carefully laid MGs and SAWs + sharpshooters.  Instead of single shot RPGs, we'd be up against Grenade Launchers and AGLs.  What is learned from Mogadishu and Iraq MAY not apply in our case.<br><br>I think the Brits actually showed the Americans how to tackle FIBUA back in 2003 when they took Basra.  Massing firepower at critical points, taking sector 1 block at a time. Once the sector is secured.  Bring up more firepower to secure the sector before moving on to the next sector.</div>

The militia always seem o have a habit to at one pull of the trigger send an entire mag down range...its almost like they are spraying and praying. So yeah, given the choice I would rather be trained to hit what I aim then just empty mags down range.</div>
