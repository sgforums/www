Well it seem like a good ideal especially when when RPG rounds hit the wall, as wall fragments fly may hit the soldiers.<br><br>But one must not forget, one can get shot at one if one is seen by the enemy, and in urban / fibua, staying close to the wall usually help to hide soldier better, walking too far from the wall make one too easy.<br><br>The advice of not close to the wall, is actually not hugging it , that is because bullet do the bounce off a wall at a angle, but it will follow along the wall, and hit anyone hugging it.<br><br>In real, think the best is to stay close to wall enough to get come camo into the environment, but not hugging it till bullet that travel along the wall will not hit you.<br></div>

Btw, have also watched some SWAT unit videos, where they have this tactic called the "wall flood" where the shooters basically line themselves against the wall upon entry and start shooting. So I mean contary to the "stay away from the walls" warning, they are actually pretty close up to it. So yeah...wondering what's the diff. in the techniques used.</div>

Btw, have also watched some SWAT unit videos, where they have this tactic called the "wall flood" where the shooters basically line themselves against the wall upon entry and start shooting. So I mean contary to the "stay away from the walls" warning, they are actually pretty close up to it. So yeah...wondering what's the diff. in the techniques used.</div></blockquote>That is a different situation altogether. You see in SWAT you know no one is going to take a pop at you as the enemy's general location is known.

I still think it is wholly unneccessary though as I doubt it matters all that much how close you are to the wall when you are sbeing shot at with anything from 7.62mm to RPGs!!! Hence I think it was added to make the delta guy look, in american parlance, "shit hot". Just like the whole nonsense with "this is my safety".</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Oh well, still at least it broadens my perspective. So when moving in a FIBUA / Urban environment, the best is to play by ear the situation. Just curious, with the 7 men section, what is the ideal placement of the troops?</div>
