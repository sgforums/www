            <div class='col-md body'>Im quoting from this site:<br><br><a href="http://www.singapore-window.org/sw03/030125mm.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.singapore-window.org/sw03/030125mm.htm</a><br><br><blockquote>Five manufacturers from the United States, France, Russia and Europe have submitted their aircraft for the NGF project which will replace the A-4SU Skyhawks and eventually the F-5S Tigers currently in service with the Republic of Singapore Air Force (RSAF).</blockquote><blockquote>Defence industry sources told The Malay Mail that the three aircraft Â– Boeing's F-15E Strike Eagle, the F/A-18E/F Super Hornet and the Eurofighter Typhoon Â– are the leading contenders for the NGF project. The contract is expected to be signed by the end of the year.</blockquote>F/A-18E/F? What a surprise..I thought Rafale should have been in the list of top three.<br><br><blockquote>Since the Super Hornet is on the Malaysian shopping list, the Strike Eagle (to be known as F-15S in Singapore service) and Typhoon are said to be most probable choice for Singapore.</blockquote><blockquote>The Malay Mail learnt that if Singapore chooses the Typhoon, the Storm Shadow will be included in the package as part of a government-to-government deal.</blockquote><blockquote>It is also believed that Singapore's Typhoons will be armed with the Meteor beyond-visual-range (BVR) air-to-air missile, which is being developed for the Royal Air Force (RAF).</blockquote><blockquote>If Singapore chooses the Strike Eagles Â– which most pundits believe they will Â– it is expected that it will be cleared to purchase long range air-to-surface missiles, the AGM-84E SLAM and AGM-142 Raptor.</blockquote>Wah, got SLAM and Raptor<br><br><blockquote><strong>The Strike Eagle has a much better chance being selected for the NGF due to the "special" relationship between Singapore and the US</strong>. If it does proceed to select the Boeing aircraft, it could strike a deal with the US to lease Strike Eagles in service with the US Air Force for training until its own aircraft are delivered.</blockquote><blockquote>The Singapore NGF is expected to be in service by 2007, almost at the same time when <strong>Malaysia's Super Hornets and Sukhoi Su-30MKMs</strong> are expected to be delivered. </blockquote></div>

I thought the Viper's radar/computer continuously calculates the impact point (CCIP) and it is one of the most accurate in the world. Vipers can also do blind bombing using the Continuosly computer Release Point (CCRP) attack mode. It also has a dive-toss attack mode. I wonder how the Super Skyhawk's avionics compares since I thought ST Aero upgraded them to be almost as capable as a A version Viper. With the C version, I thought the Vipers would fair a lot better than A4SUs. Could it be that the Vipers pilots were still pretty inexperience in using the Vipers for blind or visiual bombing with dumb bombs?<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>All i wan to say is if RSAF choose F-15T , we r in the same situation as wad th eKoreans are in choosing the F-15K, is more towards politcal agendas rather than the requirements that we wanted....The Americans packages are just sweeteners to boost up their selling products.....<br><br>just my thoughts</div>

Just because the number is a difference of 1 doesn't mean its a "why not" case.<br><br>F-15E is a good choice no doubt, but there are more cons than pros to it. You will not only have to view the plane's capabilities, but also the needs of RSAF. Not to mention America's reluctance at tech transfer.<br><br>I think you should not let Area00 get the better of you. We don't deal with games here.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote>Originally posted by Joe Black:<br><strong></strong><br><br>I am suprised that F-16s missed their targets. I thought the Viper's radar/computer continuously calculates the impact point (CCIP) and it is one of the most accurate in the world. Vipers can also do blind bombing using the Continuosly computer Release Point (CCRP) attack mode. It also has a dive-toss attack mode. I wonder how the Super Skyhawk's avionics compares since I thought ST Aero upgraded them to be almost as capable as a A version Viper. With the C version, I thought the Vipers would fair a lot better than A4SUs. Could it be that the Vipers pilots were still pretty inexperience in using the Vipers for blind or visiual bombing with dumb bombs?<br>[/b]</blockquote>Our A4s don't bomb all the time, there's something else. I asked my f-16 friend about the missing target thing b4 and he told me that f-16 is too fast. It makes sense but doesn't that make the f-16 useless. Maybe I should ask my f-16 pilot friend. Forget it. There's once that one f-16's bombs completely missed the target island. The ordnance people can't even find the bomb. (inert won't explode, just smoke). Singapore A4s are just a skyhawk on the outside but not sure about the inside. We are phasing it out not becos its useless but because there isn't much airframe hours left. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_sad.gif" alt="Sad" title="Sad"><br><br>One thing I saw at an exercise, quite funny. These 140 sqn pilots walk up to the side of the taxiway. When a f-5 taxy past, the 140 guys salute him turn 180 degrees and "moon" the f-5 pilot. The f-5 pilot lanlan. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"><br><br></div>
