            <div class='col-md body'>Hi, not an officer, but I seem to recollect that there was a period in the 80s, where cost cutting was cited as the reason that SAF stopped giving swords to every commissioned 2 LT ( or CPT  for the medical officers).  I did not ask my officer friends.... But the "story" stuck in mind, as some years later, I met an older friend who was from the 1970s batches of OCS. He had a sword proudly mounted in his living room .  We got to talk about it . He was not a SOH winner and he said that during his time, each 2LT had one, but he heard that it was discontinued. This discussion happened in the late 80s.<br><br>Does it mean that the tradition has now been re-instated? Anyone can comment?</div>

However, it does help in making you a potential SOH canididate. The main thing is your attitude and your work ethics as grading by your fellow platoon mates weigh quite heavily when it comes down to selecting the reciepiant.</div>
