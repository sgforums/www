            <div class='col-md body'>No name given for this missile in the article.  It just labels it as a long range supersonic cruise missile.  It seems to be based on the KH-35 Kayak anti ship cruise missile, except that it includes a ramjet propulsion system besides the rocket booster.<br><br>The missile can be used to attack installations as well as large warships.<br><br>Guidance appears to be some form of GPS-Datalink, as well as millimeter band radar and infrared imaging.<br><br>Launching altitude for this Air Launched Cruise missile will be approximately 10,000 to 20,000 meters, at launch speeds of Mach 0.8 to 1.5.<br><br>It will cruise at an altitude of 15,000 to 20,000 meters and continue to accelerate to approximately Mach 4. Maximum range of 400km, and uses a Hi Lo attack profile.  Missile will climb to cruising altitude and will descend on terminal homing.  Most likely sea skimming from then on.</div>

So if there's any conflict with the US, it would be most prudent to knock out most if not all of their GPS network satellites to ensure that they are unable to guide their weapon systems?
