              <p>In short, it's not so much how much explosives you can pack into your round as to how capable your round is at moving that explosive to your target. You can have a 40mm grenade that packs a lot of explosives but it's "mailing" options are limited or you can give that same amount of explosives in several smaller, but much more capable packages.</p>
              <p>Personally I'll go for the smaller format once it's perfected.</p>
              <p>And of course, there are only so many 40mm grenades you can carry as opposed to twice the amount with the new format, not to mention things like rate of fire, sustained fire, engagement envelope, precision are superior to the old 40mm. This means that a unit using the new format will be significantly more effective then a similar unit using the old format.</p>
              <p>So to end off, I don't know why lionnoisy is so desperate to put down the new format as something unworkable that will never come out for "tomorrow's war" except that fact that it will threaten the 40mm market that ST is heavily invested in, given it is so much more effective that what ST has come out with.</p>
              <p>Somehow the idea that ST will not eventually retool to make the new format once it's established is did not occur to him.</p>
              <p>In short, it seems that lionnoisy reminds me of a certain kind of video game player that puts down other video games that are not his favourite not because they are bad video games, but simply because they threaten the popularity of his favourite game.</p>

              <p>I don't think you are getting my point, which is kind of strange considering how obvious it is.</p>
              <p>The problem with the 40mm is that it's engagement options are extremely limited, even if you have a more explosives, the ability to send them to the enemy are hampered by it's slow flight time and large CEP as well as the difficulty of having to use an lobbing shot to engage even targets that are moderately close ranged.</p>
              <p>So what this means that in practice a lot of 40mm is actually wasted on missed shots, or are totally unable to engage their targets at all.</p>
              <blockquote>
              <p>I try to imagine - I shot 1 x 40mm round at a target 200m  &amp; you to make up the same payload - shoot 3 x 20mm rounds at a target 200m .  My round will hit and kill all enemies.

              <p>Erm what makes you think the 25mm grenade lacks the explosive power to take out a group of enemies?</p>
              <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">I've checked the lethal radius of both grenades, they check out at about the same. In fact the 25mm smart grenade actually has a LARGER kill radius of 10m vs 5m for the old 40mm HEDP due to it's airbursting effect. Killing power is not an issue here.</span></p>
              <p> But that's a moot point considering that 25mm smart airbust packs more then enough explosives to take out a group of enemies in one shot. I do not see any reason to doubt the killing power of the 25mm.</p>
              <p>Also if you are talking about things like new thermobaric grenades and the like, killing power is not really an issue more then the ability to send that killing power to the enemy. The main weakness of the 40mm (which you have no even adressed), is it's slow projectile that makes it very difficult to aim especially at longer ranges.</p>
              <p>Also you are not accounting for the fact that you have an increased engagement envelope afforded by the 25mm grenade. You can shoot further, faster and with more precision then the old 40mm grenade.</p>
              <p>So I don't know what you are talking about. You only look at amount of explosives and leave out things like range, ease of use, precision and the like that matter as much, if not more. I think it is you who needs to justify your case and not me, you are focusing on a very limited scope to make your argument while ignoring just about everything else.</p>
              <p>Going by your logic, one could reckon there's no need for a 40mm grenade at all because a hand held SFG grenade is far more powerful then what we can pack into a 40mm shell.</p>

              </blockquote>
              <p>Am I one?</p>
              <p>Anyone the opposite of lionnoisy would be someone who knows his stuff and argues for them well, in which case I would indeed not mind you saying I am the opposite of lionnoisy.</p>
              <p>Note that I have gone over in detail about the advantages of the new format grenades over the old 40mm, and you so far have failed to really produce anything concrete to refute them beyond vauge dismissals. I have pointed out how the greater range and precision of the 25mm affords more options to the infantryman.</p>
              <p><strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">Also I've noticed that in your points you do not seem to have done any homework on the new round, given your points made on it's range as well as the tactical advantages it offers to the user in terms of time on target are vastly off. In fact it almost seems to me that you are making your comments based not on knowledge, but on figures that I frankly have no idea where you are pulling out from except from assumptions.</span></strong></p>
              <p><strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">And I am not accusing you, I will quote your examples.</span></strong></p>
              <p><strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">Firstly, you made the mistake of getting the action of these new grenades entirely wrong, saying that they behave like tank rounds and rely on penetrative power.</span></strong></p>
              <blockquote>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #000000;">Those new generation rounds like - 20mm rounds - the concentration is speed on launch - for the penetration power, it shoot straight and fast and penetrate more like your tank rounds.  </span></span></span></p>
              </blockquote>
              <p><strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">Where in the world did you get such an idea? This is nowhere even near anywhere how the new grenades work! </span></strong></p>
              <p><strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">And penetration is certainly not part of its job description.</span></strong></p>
              <p><strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">After I corrected you, you backtracked and then came up with more points, which was as follows:</span></strong></p>
              <blockquote>
              <p>Let compare - speed 20mm vs 40mm - how much faster 0.1 sec ? I am happy with 40mm delivery speed. If ability to go 0.01 - 0.03 sec faster ... it is just better to have.</p>
              </blockquote>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>This is not only entirely wrong, your first estimate of 0.1 second is 10 to 20 times less then the actual time advantage it offers to the user, and your 0.01-0.03 sec faster it is wrong by a factor of 100!</strong></span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>The new rounds are considerably faster then the old 40mm, by a factor of nearly 2.5. This means that the rounds arrive a lot faster then the old 40mm, sometimes nearly thrice as fast.</strong></span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>Even at moderate ranges like 200 meters, the round arrives on target a nearly two seconds before the old 40mm.</strong></span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>How does this happen? Firstly the 40mm not only has a slow projectile speed of 77mps, you have to lob it significantly in order to reach the ranges you want, this means that the projectile has to travel additional distance in the arc to reach the target increasing the flight time. Increased flight time means greater projectile instability and CEP (affected by wind and the like), as well as the possibility of the enemy moving out of the lethal radius of the round as well as extremely large lead estimations.</strong></span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>The new rounds however are nearly 2.5 times at fast at 185-200mps, which affords them a much flatter arc when they are fired. This actually travel LESS distance then a 40mm when fired at the target at the same range, vastly increasing their time on target.</strong></span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>And all this matters quite a bit in battle, especially if you are trying to give squad support with grenades.</strong></span></p>
              <p><strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">And at long ranges like 400m, the new grenades beat the old one by a lot, you are talking about enough time to actually take cover in the region of 4 seconds. and the difference is extremely significant why? Because the time lag is significant enough that the enemy can actually move out of the killbox.</span></strong></p>
              <p><strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">Note that 2-4 seconds is a BIG difference from the 0.02 and 0.03 sec faster that you claimed. In fact the time advantage is about 100 times faster then what you claim!</span></strong></p>
              <p><strong><span style="color: #ff0000;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Where you got 0.02 and 0.03 I do not know seriously... but in any case the advantages afforded by the 25mm are not simply "nice to have", the can be an absolute lifesaver, you are talking in the ballpark of a 250 percent increase in performance in a very vital area such as muzzle velocity and time on target.</span></span></strong></p>
              <blockquote>
              <p><br>Let compare - range 20mm vs 40mm - ? vs 400m. Most of 40mm are 400m, I am happy with 400m. If further of course would be good. But it is hard to say 20mm has longer range. Please note that South African designers of the Milkor MGL ("M32MGL" in U.S. service) developed a new "Extended Range Low Pressure" (ERLP) 40x51mm cartridge. This round extends the range of the 40 mm grenade from 400m (440yd) to 800m (880yd).</p>
              </blockquote>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>This is another area in which you got your facts totally wrong again. The new grenades can reach out to 1 click, where the old 40mm can only reach 400 meters.</strong></span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>1000 m is a big difference from 400m, I don't see how you can say that "it is hard to say 20mm has longer range"</strong></span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>But this is not all, there is more.</strong></span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>Now range is one thing, but the ability to engage with precision at range matters as much as well. If you look at the stats for both rounds, you'll realize that the new format grenades are better as well.</strong></span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>Firstly at 400m, the 40mm grenade is not good for anything but area targets (that is dispersed targets), this is because at that range the CEP of the round is so high that it is practically useless for attacking point targets like windows or a dug in enemy. It does not matter even if the 40mm round is smart airbust because the CEP is large enough that despite the enhanced radius of the airbust, it is still ineffective in engaging point targets.</strong></span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>And I've shot at targets with the 40mm at 400m before, the round not only takes very long to arrive, it is also not good for anything other then area bombardment. Additionally the enemy can very well move out of the kill radius of the round in the time it took to reach him, meaning you to lead the target and guess where he'll be anywhere from the 5-7 seconds it takes for your 40mm to reach the killbox. </strong></span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>Contrast this to the performance of the new grenades, they can engage point targets up to 500m, which is 300-350m greater then the old grenades in point-target performance (150-200m). Additionally, beyond that they have an additional 200 meters where they will be optimal for area targets (700m) and their maximum range is a further 200 meters (1000m) where they still retain their ability to engage area targets.</strong></span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>All in all on one target for range, you are talking about a 200-250 percent increase in performance, and that is not factoring in things like smart munitions and ease of use as well as the greater volume of fire that can be sustained with the new munitions.</strong></span></p>
              <p>I would like to hear your thoughts on the greater range, precision, rate of fire, and speed of the new format grenades.</p>
              <p>In fact it seems to me that your entire case is based on one point, and that is pretty much the 40mm has more explosives then the 25mm, and as I have pointed out, this is NOT the only factor. There is no point having so much explosives when you can't effectively send it to the target.</p>
              <p>So who's the fanboy who blindly sticks to his case here? Prove to me in concrete terms why the 40mm is better and I'll agree, but your points so far are not up to scratch. And note that I'm not speaking blindly here, I've shot the 40mm HEDP before and is well aware of what it takes to aim and use this round. It does not take anybody with a bit of common sense to realize the advantages afforded by the new format grenades.</p>
              <p>Who is blind here to miss out the fact that the new projectile is up to 250% faster?</p>
              <p>Who is blind to miss out the fact that it can engage point targets over twice the distance of the old round, and area targets over twice that as well?</p>
              <p>Who is blind to miss out that the infantryman can carry twice the amount of rounds?</p>
              <p>In fact the only thing that seems visible to you is the amount of explosives... which I find very odd indeed.</p>
              <p>So I think the onus is on you to prove your case, calling me a fanboy of new technology and calling me rambo will not help, it's just a strawman argument.</p>
              <p>I do not blindly support something just because it is new, I just did the math and it pointed to the new format.</p>
              <p>I have no vested interest in advertising for the 25mm grenade anyway, am I getting paid by them? Nope. I made my own conclusions from the facts I gathered about the new grenade format, as well as my own experiences with the old. And frankly it's pretty obvious which one gives you a significant tactical advantage.</p>

            <div class='col-md body'>
              <p>What I am saying is this, all things considered there is no question which is the superior grenade. In fact the entire rash of developments in the old 40mm grenade was in response to the performance of the new format to keep it in service to the forseeable future.</p>
              <p>But if you are talking about the new generation of things? It won't be found in the 40mm grenade any more then adding superchargers to the P-51 Mustang in response to the Me262 allowed the prop plane to dominate into the jet age.</p>
              <p>My take on this? The 40mm format retains flexibility in application as it can do more then just kill stuff (whitestar, smoke, CS), but if you are talking about a killing weapon for the soldier, then it is obvious that a new format is needed other then a highly arcing, slow tactically limited weapon like the 40mm grenade. In fact the reason why the 25mm grenade is so much better is not so much as in it is so advanced then the fact that the 40mm is crappy at sending explosives across the battlefield:</p>
              <blockquote>
              <p>The <a href="http://www.atk.com/AdvancedWeaponSystems/advanceweaponsystems_xm25.asp"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0066cc;">XM25</span></span></a> provides the soldier with a 300 to 500% increase in hit probability to defeat point, area, and defilade targets out to 500 meters. The weapon features revolutionary high-explosive, air-burst ammunition programmed by the weapon's target acquisition/fire control system.</p>
              </blockquote>
              <p>What this means is that your pk is dramatically increased by 3-5 times over the old 40mm system. And worse, if two sides were to face off, one with the 25mm system the other with the 40mm system, the side using the 40mm will be vulnerable to the side with the 25mm system long before they can even get in range (1000m vs 400m), and at 500m the 25mm becomes good enough to engage point targets while the side with the 40mm can't even start to shoot for another 100 meters.</p>
              <p>And even when the 40mm side closes to 400 meters, just within their maximum range to use, their rounds have such a huge CEP and long projectile flight time they are only good for stationary, area targets while the 25mm side can engage them with precision fire all this while. In fact the 40mm side will not have a good chance of hitting point targets against the 25mm side until they close to 200 or 150 meters, plenty of time for them to get chewed up.</p>
              <p>And not that even within close engagement range, the 25mm system offers an increased rate of fire as well as longer sustained fire over the ammunition limited 40mm GL system. All in all the math indicates the 40mm side is in for a rough fight.</p>

              <p>Going by your logic, one could reckon there's no need for a 40mm grenade at all because a hand held SFG grenade is far more powerful then what we can pack into a 40mm shell.</p>
              <p>Am I one?</p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>The new rounds however are nearly 2.5 times at fast at 185-200mps, which affords them a much flatter arc when they are fired. </strong></span><strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">And at long ranges like 400m, the new grenades beat the old one by a lot, you are talking about enough time to actually take cover in the region of 4 seconds. and the difference is extremely significant why? Because the time lag is significant enough that the enemy can actually move out of the killbox.</span></strong></p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>This is another area in which you got your facts totally wrong again. The new grenades can reach out to 1 click, where the old 40mm can only reach 400 meters.</strong></span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>Now range is one thing, but the ability to engage with precision at range matters as much as well. If you look at the stats for both rounds, you'll realize that the new format grenades are better as well.</strong></span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>Firstly at 400m, the 40mm grenade is not good for anything but area targets (that is dispersed targets), this is because at that range the CEP of the round is so high that it is practically useless for attacking point targets like windows or a dug in enemy. </strong></span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong></strong></span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>And I've shot at targets with the 40mm at 400m before, the round not only takes very long to arrive, it is also not good for anything other then area bombardment. Additionally the enemy can very well move out of the kill radius of the round in the time it took to reach him, meaning you to lead the target and guess where he'll be anywhere from the 5-7 seconds it takes for your 40mm to reach the killbox.</strong></span></p>
              <p>I would like to hear your thoughts on the greater range, precision, rate of fire, and speed of the new format grenades.</p>

              <p>Your arugement is that 20mm round is better then 40mm round and should replace it.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>My argument was 40mm round have its advantages also - it will not replace by 20mm - it have its place , and co-exist with 20mm.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I have stated that 40mm have its own advantage, which you 20mm round cannot beat . <br><br>Look at what the words that you twisted out of context - "one could reckon there's no need for a 40mm grenade at all because a hand held SFG grenade is far more powerful then what we can pack into a 40mm shell" ?  This statement just is exactly what i am trying to say - every weapon have its own use, like SPG grenade ... there is a time when it is more handly to use then 20mm or 40mm !!! <br><br>Unlike you which blindly just say that 20mm is totally advantage over 40mm - i am just trying to remind you that yes 20mm may have the range and speed , but there is other factor like payload !!! which come in effect !!! - You cannot just blindly argue on range and speed !!! I also bring up - that fact that people also come up with longer range 40mm which can also reach 800m - you ignore it !!!</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I have seen navy seal shoot 40mm into a window 100 -200m alway acurately !!! It works. 40mm is mean to be indirect fire - that the way arty works. Tell me if enemy is dig in if 40mm cannot hit them how in the world 20mm can ? it drill into the earth is it ?</p>

              <p>if you want precision - you shoot the guy with rifle !!! - you use 40mm as arty - which is indirect fire - area target !</p>
              <p><br>I am telling you may blindly love 20mm but 40mm is here to stay - you cannot replace it with 20mm as it still have its own advantage over 20mm. 20mm will just complement it .</p>

              <p> You can't even get your facts straight, and not to mention the round in question now is the 25mm format.</p>
              <p>And yes, if you are talking about for the purpose of killing, the 25mm format is intended and will eventually replace the 40mm round. This is not my argument or intention, but the argument and intention of the US military as well as others looking into it.</p>
              <p>So blame me for what? It's you who didn't read the literature on the subject.</p>

              <p> Wrong. If you are talking about the intention of the 40mm round for killing, the intention is to eventually phase it out for a superior format, which as it stands now is the 25mm.</p>

              <p>40mm has no choice but to be indirect fire because it is simply too slow.</p>
              <p>What will the same navy seal do with a new format grenade that affords him a 300-500 percent hit to kill probability on that same target? His combat effectiveness will drastically increase.</p>
              <p>Also that same seal with the 25mm will be able to pop a window at 500 meters, far futher then he could with the 40mm.</p>
              <p>That same seal will have a drastic advantage over a smiliar seal using the 40mm.</p>

              <p>Rubbish once again. The smart airbust of the 25mm is designed to kill such a target, in fact is is actually more effective then the old 40mm HEDP then killing a target behind cover.</p>
              <p>Also, if the enemy is out of your engagement envelope of 40mm how are you going to hit him?</p>
              <p>Use a better round lah.</p>

              <p>if you want precision - you shoot the guy with rifle !!! - you use 40mm as arty - which is indirect fire - area target !</p>
              </blockquote>
              <p>LOL, this point is pretty funny. Nice attempt to rewrite the field manual on infantry tactics though.</p>
              <p>Wrong again. If you lack precision you can't even kill your target at all.</p>
              <p>What you are using are singular and vauge examples. Just because a seal can drop a 40mm into a window at 200 meters does not mean that this is a feat that can be replicated with reliability across the entire army.</p>
              <p>Add in things like having to have many different users from the average infantryman to spec ops forces, and other factors in combat you get this thing known as Pk, or probability of kill.</p>
              <p>And the fact is, the Pk of 40mm is low compared to other options. This means that for a single target it does not matter if a seal could drop a round into a window at 200 meters ONCE or that you've seen it once. What matters is that the entire army can repeat this feat with efficency.</p>
              <p>And unfortunately they can't. It's a well known fact that 40mm leaves much to be desired, that's what they need a superior round.</p>
              <p>With it's puny kill radius, large CEP, slow velocity and long flight time the 40mm is hardly an ideal arty package, and in fact it's indirect flight path is bane rather then boom for it.</p>
              <p>This is because infantrymen engage targets within their LOS, engaging something within your LOS with slow, indirect fire is nonsense.</p>
              <blockquote>
              <p>Why are you so blindly on greater range, precision, rate of fire, and speed ???  If you so blindly think fast,rate of fire, precision and speed , then you are blind !!!</p>

              <p>As opposed to what?</p>
              <p>Your vauge and failing arguments that aren't making any headway in anything?</p>
              <p>I am sorry but you need to do your math. If I can engage a targer further, faster and with more precision then you what does this say about my ability to kill you compared to what you who are armed with something vastly inferior?</p>
              <p>I would like you see you using the same argument arguing for the "co-existence" of the british longbow versus the assault rifle.</p>
              <p>Frankly, your arguments are getting quite funny.</p>

              <p> You are also telling me a lot about your ability to make coherent arguments.</p>
              <p>ROFL.</p>
              <p>Anyway I am telling you that new format grenades will eventually replace 40mm for the purpose of killing if things go as plan and the technology is worked out, and that has always been my point.</p>
              <p>40mm may survive in other applications where they are good for, but in as far as coming to kill the enemy they are running out of time.</p>

              <p>Personally I don't think ST and SAF work very well together... at least when it comes to things like infantry weapons. The most bread and butter weapon, the SAR is still to make its rounds around the SAF despite it being in existence for nearly a decade. In fact when I was in service which was not long ago even our grenadiers in a front line unit have not gotten the SAR-21 M203, which means there is a lack of compatiability between our SAR-gunners and our grenadiers. Can't swap mags if needed.</p>

              <p>Wow, so now instead of actually facing your opponent in the field of debate, you are setting up some arbitary standards of judging the matter?</p>
              <p>The case in point has no time frame, I am saying simply is that once the situation allows for the new format grenades to be perfected, there is no question about their superior killing ability over the old format grenades. And also I am arguing for the fact that a unit using the new round would be far better off then one using an old round.</p>
              <p>Pretty much you are trying to argue in vauge and ambigious terms, such as length of service and the like. Being in service or being popular does not mean that something is sucessful not should you actually go into war with it.</p>
              <p>In simple terms, I don't care if 40mm is still in service 10 or 20 years from now. What matters is that my men go into battle with the greatest advantage afforded. Chances are if you are stuck with an old thing is more of having no choice or lack of ability to get something better instead of it actually being useful.</p>

              <p>That's your reading into my position.</p>
              <p>My position is simple but you have failed to grasp it. The new format grenades are superior to the old ones and offers the grunt more killing ability. What militaries do with that knowledge is not my concern, though I suspect they are more likely to see reason then you.</p>

              <p>Unfortunately you fail to appeal to the law of logical congruence.</p>
              <p>Why should not your example be taken to it's logical extreme? If you made a valid and solid point it should be able to wistand intellectual rigour and testing.

              <p>You are the one going by singular and isloated examples and ignoring the cold, hard numbers.</p>
              <p>My point is simple, I don't care if something can be put through a window by a Navy at 200 meters or what diameter it is or not. If it's better it's better. If it replaces or does not replace something is not my concern. But naturally militaries are always in the habit of improving their stuff so chances are your beloved 40mm will go the way or the dinosaurs or be forced to change and adapt their roles.</p>
              <p>But in my opinion of course, is that once technology is perfected there is no question of what the military will do or choose. You don't fight a war by hanging onto legacy systems once you have something better at hand. In fact various attempts to replace the M-16 is not so much proof that the M-16 cannot be dispensed with, but that the US military reconizes they need something much better then it.</p>

              <p>In fact I have spelt out much more clearly then you what the 40mm can and cannot do. Instead of writing "I can take out groups of enemies" or "I've seen a navy seal do..." I have gotten down to the numbers and did my math.</p>
              <p>So while you write about navy seals I can point out that same navy seal</p>
              <p>So what's totally ineffective? Only in your world of one-track, black and whites there are.</p>
              <p>The facts are simple 400m vs 1000m max range, 300-500% improved Pk, 150-200m vs 500m point target performance, 200+% improvement in flight time. I make my conclusions from there.</p>
              <p>"Write till it is totally ineffective" is your assumption and you went on to make a unnecessary and weak argument on the number of people killed and injured by it which does nothing to add to your case. Did I say the 40mm was unable to kill? Nope, that was your little pet case and you're proving something that everybody already know that did nothing but made you look like you didn't know how to argue cohorently.</p>
              <p>I am afraid you are your own worse enemy in this thread. </p>

              <p> Oh boy, you really pwned yourself hard this time...</p>
              <p>This is a good example of you not doing your homework once again. The new format grenades are still in <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">development</span></strong>, so what makes you think that something that is still in development will magically find adoption in militaries worldwide. Is the JSF currently in widespread use? Is network centric warfare in widespread use yet? Is the FCS AFV or AAAV in widespread use?</p>
              <p>Are these systems vastly superior to current ones and slated to eventually replace them?</p>
              <p>Yes.</p>
              <p>Just FYI, does the US Army's attempt to find a better alternative to the 40mm to equip their troops count as a big user to you?</p>
              <p>LOL.</p>
              <p>You don't seem to know just about anything about the actual affairs of things given you have done little in this thread but make a long string of embarrassing factual errors in your posts and then trying to crying about your opponent being more prepared then you, how funny and sad.</p>

              <p>For the reason given in my response above, you just about wasted your energy typing this paragraph. It seems that common sense and basic reasoning is not your concern and now you are trying for desperate arguments to booster your failing case... but it is unfortunate that you've made just another embarassing mistake by trying to argue against a future combat system by going for it's current adoption status when it's not even in that stage yet, a simply fact you could have picked up had you bothered to even read the relevant articles.</p>
              <p>So who's the ignorant one here speaking bird talk?</p>

              <p>USA made a mistake by developing ABS in individual weapon first,</p>

              <p>Don't avoid the question and ask for more examples. You asked for examples and got it now you have to answer the question.</p>
              <p>How is STK even unique, or the first in this concept of ABM given others have already done it?</p>
              <p>Even Rheinmetall Defence, which is a defence contractor that is much bigger then STK long has this figured out. As they said, the concept is NOTHING NEW and have their own line of 40mm ABM... the only difference it seems is that this is so chicken feat for them that they unlike STK, do not see the need to scream about it in local papers like the Straits Times to influence people like you who don't seem to know anything at all about all things military so you can start to extrapolate fantastic abilities like killing tank-optics at extreme range for it:</p>
              <p>As the Germans said:</p>
              <p>"<span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>The basic concept isn't entirely new</strong></span>. RWM Schweiz AG already developed its 35 mm Ahead ammunition <span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>for air defence more than ten years ago</strong></span>," says senior scientist Pierre Freymond. "The Ahead projectile contains a programmable time fuse that is inductively programmed at the muzzle. The fire control unit calculates the fuse setting time on the basis of specific parameters (such as air pressure, temperature, range and muzzle speed)."</p>
              <p>Note, 10 years ago. STK is simply using a decade old idea.</p>
              <blockquote>
              <p>I need</p>
              <p>laser range finder for both calibres</p>
              </blockquote>
              <p>Please don't demostrate your ignorance of military technology.</p>
              <p>Why would you need a seperate range finder for both calibers? All you need is one and you shoot accordingly to the range as indicated by your sight.</p>
              <p>Why increase weight for an extra range finder that will tell you redundant information? Do you need seperate salt shakers for your soup and fries?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <blockquote>
              <p>With billions of defense budgets.how come there is no</p>

              There is already a dual caliber weapon long in use by the US for decades:</blockquote>

              <p>Adding smart munitions to this is nothing new, just teaching an old dog new tricks, for some reason you seem to think that STK is the only company who knows how to do it.</p>
              <p>If you are talking about why there isn't any smart grenade launcher in use currently, use your common sense:</p>
              <blockquote>
              <p>Look at above proposed XM 8.Rifle plus single shot GL.Old stuff lah.</p>
              </blockquote>
              <p>That is practical, not old. Instead of trying to figure out how to keep messing around with heavy and slow 40mm rounds, this is just a stopgap while they work with a new format, you want to mess around with stacking 40mm grenades or coming up with a clunky SSW to load them in a magazine be my guest.</p>
              <p>What is old stuff? Trying to make old 40mm grenades "smart"? Or working to develop a new, faster, and more effective round?</p>
              <p>Instead of just teaching new tricks to a limited 40mm grenade format, the US is researching on a new ammunition format that is up to 500 percent more capable in engaging targets then the old 40mm HEDP format.</p>
              <p>It is obvious you have run out of examples and are just trying to twist each and every example, no matter how bad the point you create is in a weak attempt to try to show why STK even has anything on the yanks.</p>
              <p>Unfortunately it's not working.</p>
              <blockquote>
              <p>I mean rifle plus grenade.Rifle + shot gun is ready or soon wil be ready</p>
              <p>for Yankees.</p>
              </blockquote>
              <p>Another case of your not doing your homework.</p>
              <p>This has long been in use, for some reason you seem to think it is "ready or soon wil be ready for Yankees"</p>
              <p>What's next? You're going to ask if the AK47 is "ready or soon wil be ready for Ruskies?"</p>

              <p>More correctly the question should be "advanced firearms" concepts, are there anymore?</p>
              <p>Firing air burst rounds is just one part of an advanced infantry weapon, what is more important if the other concepts are being implemented on not just the Squad Support level but also for the normal grunts.</p>
              <p>Unfortunately for lionnoisy, STK is neither ahead, nor the first in this field... plenty of weapons developed by other countries are already in the game. Note that below is an not-complete list of advanced firearms being developed and produced by other nations.</p>
              <p>Some can fire air bursting grenades, some are future-warrior capable, but they are all on par more advanced then what STK is marketing in the SSW. </p>

              <p>Korea OICW- more powerful KE module then ST SSW as well as capable of smart grenade launching.</p>
              <p><a class="thumbed_image" rel="lightbox" href="http://inlinethumb22.webshots.com/5397/2373087570098563662S600x600Q85.jpg"><img src="http://inlinethumb22.webshots.com/5397/2373087570098563662S600x600Q85.jpg" alt="" width="288" height="222"></a></p>
              <p>Australia OICW concept, using their metalstorm technology to stack 40mm rounds. The KE module again is more powerful then STK's SSW.</p>
              <p>Note that the balance of this weapon, due to the fact that the HE module is above, rather then overslung, is superior to the front heavy SAR-21/M203, worse if the SAR-21 is using a stacked grenade launcher (technology ironically borrowed from the aussies lionnoisy tries to knock).</p>

              <p>Israeli TAR-21 OICW variant -a modified TAR-21 rifle fitted with electronic sighting and fire control unit and tactical data interfaces.</p>
              <p>Note the Israelis have developed smart grenades as well.</p>
              <p>This variant once again, will have a more powerful KE module then STK's SSW.</p>
              <p><a class="thumbed_image" rel="lightbox" href="http://files.uzitalk.com/reference/shows/shotshow2004/FN2000.jpg"><img src="http://files.uzitalk.com/reference/shows/shotshow2004/FN2000.jpg" alt="" width="288" height="129"></a></p>
              <p>Belgian FN2000, dual caliber, capable of firing smart grenades with FCS addon. Not surprisingly, a more powerful KE module then ST's SSW yet again.</p>

              <p>Even the venerable M-4 has been decked to be capable of this ability, in the Land Warrior system with advanced sighting systems.</p>

When associated with IMI's new time-fused, air-burst 40mm grenades, MPRS uses a built-in communications device to set the grenade's programmable fuze to explode the grenade at the required distance and height above the target or around a corner, to achieve the desired air-burst effect.</span><span style="color: black; font-family: Arial;"> </span></span></span></p>

The grenade is fired through a ballistic trajectory toward the target, transmitting images of the target through its descent. IMI is cooperating with Israel Aircraft Industries MLM division to develop a command and control system which will be based on MPRS elements and establish effective management and control of infantry units. The system will interface with the warfighter's fire control systems, day/night observation systems (such as binoculars and recce grenades) and personal role radios.</span></span></span></p>

              <p>The Israeli MPRS is already working and the concept is sound and proven, not to mention they save a lot of money and time by using their TAR-21 (which is a generally superior infantry weapon to the SAR-21) as a base.</p>
              <p>Our SSW can truly be considered to be in production when we see our grunts carry and use it in the field. Not all our soldiers have recieved the SAR-21 or the SAR-21 M203, what makes you think such a specialist weapon like the SSW is anything but years away from even being issued?</p>

              <p><strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">Should we give lionnoisy a break?</span></strong></p>
              <p>Well he could give himself a break by actually using some basic, decent common sense before he tries to post in here. Is it any surprise that he always gets mauled?</p>
              <p>What other results can come from the following ideas:</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>1. Use Fantail UAV crash into targets, repeated claims of Fantail as the smallest UAV in the world (untrue).</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>2. Launching F-18s off Landing Helicopter Dock Ships</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>3. Despite only having fired 20 rounds in his NS, he somehow tries to tell infantrymen in here that carrying the SAR-21 in one hand by scope handle as an extremely important combat tactic when "running for your life", leaving soldiers completely defenceless and unbalanced.</p>
              <p>The real reason it seemed that lionnoisy was so insistent on it was simply because a scope handle was a feature the TAR-21 did not have but the SAR-21 did, and hence wanted to play it up even if it made no sense after realizing that the TAR-21 is practically a superior infantry weapon in almost every respect... which is not surprising given the TAR-21 is a more expensive weapon built to higher standards by the Israelis. But lionnoisy just can't accept it however.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>4. Arguing that 200 ton blast rated Mandai Underground Ammunition Facility on par with Cheyenne Mountains' massive multimegaton nuclear bunker.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>5. Repeatedly arguing that the Australian navy must somehow have a ship to guard each and every single mile of their 18,000 km coast as well as vast Ocean, leaving out the fact that not even the USN is capable of such a feat.</p>
              <p>6. Claiming that a large and slow, 76m/s 40mm round is the way to go given people are looking for a better, faster and lighter solution. Apparently this is not because the 40mm is better, but simply because Singapore happens to make a lot of it and lionnoisy just cannot help but see the need to "boost" its reputation.</p>
              <p>He does so by claiming that our locally manufactured rounds are capable of amazing feats like disabling AFV vision at extreme range and what have you not, as well as claiming that Singapore is at the frontier of developing and manufacturing smart, air bursting munitions when this is not even true given the concept is hardly new, and that other nations have developed it before we did.</p>
              <p>Also note that some of the ST inventions he is so hot about actually use AUSTRALIAN technology, namely in the stacked grenade launcher, but he is quiet about that for some reason and tries not to play up that part.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>7. Proposing the use of inline skates for our infantrymen to save fuel and gain battlefield mobility, when contradicted by experienced soldiers in here he tried repeatedly to defend his idea without adressing any of their points, as usual going about his routine of not answering the glaring holes pointed out in his theories and to keep on raising new and useless questions.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>And the best one:</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>8: Creating a clone to support himself when he could not win in virtually all his arguments, when exposed he panicked, went crazy and started making bizzare excuses about how his account was hacked before dissappearing for a few days.</p>
              <p>But as time has shown, he is a person that just does not learn from his mistakes, as eventually the itch will build up enough that he will just have to post something.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>So tell me, not say people don't want to give him a break, he is the one that can't give himself a break and keeps pwning himself with his ineffective and dishonest behavior in here.</p>
              <p>If he had any common sense, he can be a bit more humble and realize that Singapore's Military is not the best is alot of things and admit our limitations, but unfortunately that is utterly unthinkable to him.</p>
              <p>To him the SAF is just another tool to further his rah-rah about Singapore, which is actually a real disgrace to the people who have done the SAF proud.</p>
              <p>So you tell me, give this guy a break from what? His actions are a joke and against everything a real soldier stands for. There is no honour, intergity and courage in his behaviour in here.</p>
