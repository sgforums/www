            <div class='col-md body'>Let me help you define the term.<br>----------------------------------------------------------------------------<br><br>An aircraft carrier is a warship designed to deploy and recover aircraftÂ—in effect acting as a sea-going airbase. Aircraft carriers thus allow a naval force to project air power great distances without having to depend on local bases for land-based aircraft. Modern navies that operate such ships treat aircraft carriers as the centerpiece of the fleet, a role previously played by the battleship. The change, part of the growth of air power as a significant part of warfare, took place during World War II. Unescorted carriers are considered vulnerable to attack by other ships, aircraft, submarines or missiles and therefore travel as part of a carrier battle group.<br><br>Aircraft carriers today<br>Aircraft carriers are generally the largest ships operated by navies; a Nimitz class carrier powered by two nuclear reactors and four steam turbines is 1092 ft (333 m) long and costs about $4.5 billion. The United States has the majority of aircraft carriers with a dozen in service, and its aircraft carriers are a cornerstone of American power projection capability.<br><br>Nine countries maintain aircraft carriers: United States, United Kingdom, France, Russia, Spain, Brazil, Italy, India and Thailand. In addition the People's Republic of China's People's Liberation Army Navy possesses the former Soviet aircraft carrier Varyag, but most naval analysts believe that they have no intention to operate it, but instead are using Varyag to learn about carrier operations for a future Chinese aircraft carrier. Canada, China, Japan, Pakistan, Australia, Chile and Singapore also operate helicopter-carrying vessels.<br><br>Aircraft carriers are generally accompanied by a number of other ships, to provide protection for the relatively unwieldy carrier, to carry supplies, and to provide additional offensive capabilities. This is often termed a battle group or carrier group, sometimes a carrier battle group.<br><br><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aircraft_carrier" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aircraft_carrier</a></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Amphibious assault ships, usually shortened to amphibs, phibs or popularly known as gator freighters, denotes a range of classes of warship employed to land and support ground forces on enemy territory by an amphibious assault. The largest fleet of these types is operated by the United States Navy, including the Tarawa class dating back to the 1970s and the newer and larger Wasp class ships that debuted in 1989. While grossly resembling aircraft carriers, the role of an amphibious assault ship is fundamentally different: its aviation facilities have the primary role of hosting helicopters to support forces ashore rather than to support strike aircraft.<br><br>.....<br><br>Singapore (Republic of Singapore Navy)<br><br>* Endurance (2000)<br>* Resolution (2000)<br>* Persistence (2001)<br>* Endeavour (2001)<br><br>.....<br><br><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amphibious_assault_ship" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amphibious_assault_ship</a></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>The Endurance class amphibious transport docks are the biggest class of ships in the RSN. They were designed and built locally by ST Marine to replace the old County class tank landing ships. Each ship is fitted with a well dock which can accommodate four landing craft, as well as a flight deck which can accommodate two medium lift helicopters [11]. The ships provide sea transportation for personnel and equipment for SAF's overseas training, as well as a training platform for RSN's midshipmen. The ships are also actively involved in humanitarian and disaster relief operations, notably in East Timor, the Persian Gulf and the recent tsunami-hit Indonesian province of Aceh. The four ships form the 191 Squadron of the RSN.<br><br><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/0/02/RSN_Endurance_class_LPD.jpg"><br><br>RSS Endurance during IMDEX 2001<br>Â© Jane's<br><br><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/f/f1/RSN_Endurance_class_LPD_2.jpg"><br><br>RSS Endurance, RSS Persistence and RSS Endeavour in Meulaboh, Indonesia as part of 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami humanitarian relief efforts<br>Â© MINDEF<br><br>An amphibious transport dock (also called a landing platform dock or LPD) is an amphibious assault ship, a warship that embarks, transports, and lands elements of a landing force for expeditionary warfare missions. The United States Navy operates several of this type of ship; their helicopters, vertical take-off and landing aircraft, and air-cushion or conventional landing craft support of the United States Marine Corps's "vertical envelopment" assault doctrine. The ships are generally designed to transport troops into a war zone by sea, primarily using landing craft, although invariably they will also have a limited airborne capability.<br><br>Amphibious transport docks perform the mission of amphibious transports, amphibious cargo ships, and the older LPDs by incorporating both a flight deck and a well deck that can be ballasted and deballasted to support landing craft or amphibious vehicles.<br><br>In Service<br>[edit]<br><br>United States Navy<br><br>* San Antonio<br>* Austin<br>* Trenton<br><br>[edit]<br><br>Royal Navy<br><br>* Albion<br><br>[edit]<br><br>French Navy<br><br>* Foudre<br>* Ouragan<br><br>[edit]<br><br>Republic of Singapore Navy<br><br>* Endurance<br><br>[edit]<br><br>Spanish Navy<br><br>* Galicia (Same design as Dutch Rotterdam)<br><br>[edit]<br><br>Royal Netherlands Navy<br><br>* Rotterdam<br><br>[edit]<br><br>Decommissioned<br>[edit]<br><br>United States Navy<br><br>* Raleigh<br><br>[edit]<br><br>Royal Navy<br><br>* Fearless<br></div>

And they have 2 carriers there with extra land harriers even.<br><br>Our frigates will be more useful in offensive and convoy protection than tied down to protect carrier. Rather then thinking of how to put 1 or 2 planes on ship like frigate, you would rather put vls storm shadow on the frigate instead. This will soon be available ,and hopefully our frigate will go for that, and we be able to hit land targets without even planes, which is a cheaper and better options.<br><br></div>
