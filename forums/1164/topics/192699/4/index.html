Look at how the ill-fated Atlantic Conveyor was used as a helicopter carrier during the Falklands/Malvinas War in 1982. The Brits have had some success using the Royal Fleet Auxiliary Argus as a helo carrier too.<br><br>Closer to home, check out how the US Navy has used some of its maritime prepositioning ships (MPS) ro-ro ships as helo carriers.....  with Seahawks as their air group.<br><br>If you have a good hull form, it's not rocket science converting it into a flat top for V/STOL aircraft or helos. Many carriers that served during WW2 were converted from merchant ship hulls, examples include the Bogue-class and Kaiser-class escort carriers, which served with distinction, and assorted Imperial Japanese Navy types Junyo, Taiyo Chuyo, Unyo etc that had a poorer combat record due more to tactical shortcomings and inept operational deployment rather than their design limitation.<br><br>And who said a V/STOL aircraft needs to be manned....... Harriers are yesterday's story.   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br><br>P.S. Speaking of STUFT.... interestingly, the hull form of the Endurance-class ships appears to have been based on the Tropic-class 400-TEU ro-ro/lo-lo commercial vessels, Tropic Tide and Tropic Sun, built by STEM.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>IMO, modified super tanker ship should be good enough..<br><br>Singapore need to purschase Harriers whereby Harriers can take off from land air base and fly to the super tanker ship (which act as sea forward fuel base) and land and refuel and then fly to provide fire suppression  ,Close Air Support using cluster bomb, mavericks, and unguilded rockets to strike enemy near the coastal area and then fly to super tanker ship for refuelling and fly back to airbase..<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by ^Delta^:</div><div class="quote_body">Not true at all... It was revealed last year by the US that Singapore was one of the potential export customers to be given priority for early delivery of the F-35. (From JDW) However delays in the program have pushed proposed delivery dates to a more realistic 2014. Given the need to replace aged F-5 fighters, it is simply not possible to wait 10 or 20 years.<br><br>However, expect fierce competition from Dassault and EADS which are expected to pitch their wares once again with advanced variants of the Rafale and Eurofighter respectively, along with Saab offering an advanced Gripen if the RSAF opts for a less expensive option. More F-15 Strike Eagles may be ordered beyond the requirement of 40 if all options fail.<br><br></div></blockquote>I don't expect them to sell such cutting edge technology freely.  Similary ours will be another reduced in capability version.  Now since you can't add third party stuff in.  Makes it very difficult to see IOC.</div>
