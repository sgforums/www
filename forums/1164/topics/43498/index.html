With the revised NS training system, the majority of NSmen will only need to serve at least seven high-key ICTs.  A two-day Basic Individual Training (BIT) programme that focuses on physical fitness, marksmanship and refresher training has also been introduced in the last three years of their 13 years of NS training.  This ensures that NSmen maintain their currency in basic soldiering skills.  Mobilisation exercises will also be conducted during the BIT phase to maintain operational readiness......<br><br>more from the link......<br><br></div>

I did four ICTs, all high-keys, does that mean that I only have 3 more ICTs to go. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>That is good.
