America and Japan came up with a series of sanctions, North Korea responded with another underground nuclear test on Jan 10.<br>US intelligence confirmed that North Korea is not ready to use any nuclear weapon (not possibility of a nuclear war), and decide to carry out first strike against their nuclear facilities.<br>Jan 15, 2007, North Korea army marched across 38th parallel, ....<br>UN in an emergency meeting passed resolution to condemn the invasion, and call on all friendly nations to join in the fight against North Korea, a UN military coalition is formed....but,<br>China and Russia, though join in the condemnation, promise material supplies, humanity assistance but no troops. For nationalist reason, no Japanese troops allowed on the Korean pennisular, but Japan opens all military facilities to be used by the allied coalition.<br>What will Singapore do?<br>1. send in medical and comms units.<br>2. plus warships for naval blockade.<br>3. plus a squadron of F16 to strike against invading forces.<br><br>are we prepared to commit land fighting forces?<br>are we ready to fight in such severe weather conditions?<br>to really make a difference, what size of land forces should we send?<br>what are the problems we might face if we fight alongside an international forces?<br><br>hope this is just a paper discussion.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>The most probable action taken will be a statement condemning the attack in line with the UN and perhaps send in medical support and one LST to support the operations. There's a very low chance that the fighters might be sent in but I doubt they'll even think of sending troops so all you slackers can rest easy.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Well, let's take it this way, If North Korea attacks South Korea, they will have their Artillery firing at Seoul, that will kill many civillians. It is also know that the North has much of it's troops along the 38th Parallel, so they would sure be a sudden rush of invasion along the whole border, that itseld would be a problem. And if China and Russia were to help with Logistic and weapons stuff, the North could be advancing very rapidly and taking control of the South very fast.</div>
