            <div class='col-md body'>Fighting as part of a UN coalition force is much less politically sensitive in Korea than in the Middle East. The enemy is clearly the dictator and his army, it is not ambiguous as in the middle east, different ethnic groups and different religious sect, all with different interests. North korea do not have many sympathizers, there will not be any diplomatic fall out. You are not likely to have terrorists carrying out retaliating raids in your home ground.<br>It is also not fighting for the american interest, for there is no oil reserves. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br><br>If everybody agrees that we should not send in any fighting forces, we are all agreeing that SAF is for the defence of Singapore only.

America and Japan came up with a series of sanctions, North Korea responded with another underground nuclear test on Jan 10.<br>US intelligence confirmed that North Korea is not ready to use any nuclear weapon (not possibility of a nuclear war), and decide to carry out first strike against their nuclear facilities.<br>Jan 15, 2007, North Korea army marched across 38th parallel, ....<br>UN in an emergency meeting passed resolution to condemn the invasion, and call on all friendly nations to join in the fight against North Korea, a UN military coalition is formed....but,<br>China and Russia, though join in the condemnation, promise material supplies, humanity assistance but no troops. For nationalist reason, no Japanese troops allowed on the Korean pennisular, but Japan opens all military facilities to be used by the allied coalition.<br>What will Singapore do?<br>1. send in medical and comms units.<br>2. plus warships for naval blockade.<br>3. plus a squadron of F16 to strike against invading forces.<br><br>are we prepared to commit land fighting forces?<br>are we ready to fight in such severe weather conditions?<br>to really make a difference, what size of land forces should we send?<br>what are the problems we might face if we fight alongside an international forces?<br><br>hope this is just a paper discussion.</div></blockquote>Singapore should do nothing ! By then US, Japan &amp; other Nato countries would have enough troops to take care of the situation.<br><br>Singapore should just stay put, where it army force will play a more important role of stabilizing this region, and keeping trade route and supply route open. This role is more important is it keep the back of the allied coalition forces cover and secure their supplies and reenforcement routes.<br><br></div>
