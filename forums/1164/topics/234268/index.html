            <div class='col-md body'>i recently saw this post on the defencetalk.com forum, in which a forummer posted some close up shots of a new ST designed frigate. I was wondering what are the chances RSN might want to adopt this design. The ship is definitely larger than the Formidables and it seems to have spaces for 6x8 VLS system. Thus some land attack cruise missile can be placed on them. It can also serve as a mobile long range air defence system if we get something beyond Aster15. From the picture, the radar dun see to be like the Herakles and I think RSN ought to get better radar as our neighbours are improving in terms of air defence. SMART-L/APAR combination, Sampson or EMPAR? Could the future RSN ship be mounted with them?<br>Another thing is that in the pics there seem to be this diamond shape thing on near the missile position, wad could they be? Chaff, or hidden CIWS?<br><br><a href="http://www.defencetalk.com/forums/showthread.php?t=5800" rel="nofollow">http://www.defencetalk.com/forums/showthread.php?t=5800</a></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I think the future plan for RSN in general is to have larger vessels both for transportation and for naval warfare. I think we should get an LPD with at least 4 helo platforms on them. The existing Endurance can only carry 350 men and 18 tanks thus we need a platform that can carry at least a battalion worth of ppls. Larger insertion platforms are also needed as the existing FCEP and FCU can't carry ppls to shores that are cluttered with debris, eg. Tsunami aid in Indon. Small vessels also rroll like mad even in the calmest of water.<br><br>As for combat fleet I think we should transfer th smaller vessels to PCG thus allowing them to have a brown water capabilities, and allowing us to expand our forces without straining manpower.<br>I believe any future corvette must have at least 80m worth of length to ensure better sea-keeping.<br>We should also get new frigates at least 130m in length. These vessels will act as air defense platform with 64 VLS while the rest are general purpose frigates. Lastly, we should convert one or two of our Endurance to become a missile carrier, in which land attack cruise missiles will be placed on them. This will increase our dimensions of attacking capabilities while at the same time create a mobile air defense screen.</div>

Building cruise missle capability, multi-mission capable LHD/LSTs will bring about alot of whining from others. Sad no one gave a hoot about those 18 MLRS platforms.

They probably weren't designed for endurance however but I wonder if the RSN ever intended for them to deal with mines in the Sumatra strait.<br><br>For the anti-submarine vessels, they are pretty small and secondly obviously lack endurance. Now if we intended them for escorts, they are darn slow escorts and probably have a lower cruise speed than our frigates. Judging from the fact they are characterised as patrol vessels, their capabilities are limited. I reckon that if we grab boats like the Visby, not only will they be stealthy, their larger size gives them far greater flexibility now than before.</div>

They obviously can't be escorts since they don't have the speed to keep up with the MCVs for starters. I won't count on them to protect the fleet from submarine attack which is probably why we acquired submarines anyhow. I'm of the opinion also that ships can't be jack of all trades which is why a CVBG has dedicated anti-submarine frigates and destroyers as the offensive arm and defensive arm.<br><br>Our fleet, even with the new frigates, is still very much a coastal fleet with a largely defensive posture. Most likely they are tasked to handle naval blockades and that's as far as I think they would go, aside from possible support of amphibious landings, which in my opinion is a tricky proposition at best.</div>

This could be done at short notice probably before any event of hostilities.<br><br>Hulls 6 to 12 can probably mount 4 or 8 Harpoon SSMs at short notice if needed. However, they would probably be just launch platforms supplementing the firepower of a task force with assisted guidance from the larger corvettes or frigates needed for long-range engagements.<br><br>But just a sidenote that the MCVs are longer than the PVs, not the other way round. The exact length would be 62.4m for an MCV versus 55m for a PV, as taken from Jane's. Each MCV is thus around 100 tons heavier than a PV.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>maybe we can have small fast attack craft armed with maybe ATGMs that lurk in swamps or estuaries and ambush enemy ships and run at high speed eg 40knots? these small craft may have profiles on the radar that resemble small sampan or fishing craft and being small size and speedy, offers a smaller target to enemy gunners and definitely not worth an exocet<br><br></div>
