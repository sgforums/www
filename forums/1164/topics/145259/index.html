            <div class='col-md body'>The two sjoormen class subs are to be decommissioned in 2010. Seriously, the Sjoormen class subs are used only as a training platform for singapore.<br>The vastorgotland class are Air Indpendent Propulsion submarines. It is thought that singapore will get two of them from Sweden. This subs are new in submarine terms. The subs are launched in 1987-1990. The new subs are a major destabilizing factor as we will be the only ones operating AIP subs in the region.  It is also expected that singapore will get the eurotorp 2000.<br>Each of ther subs are expected to cost about 300 million.<br>Actually, it is suspected that Singapore crew is already training on it.<br>Recently, Singapore participated in a navy exercise in the pacific as part of the swedish contingent. Apparently, our crew surprised the Americans as we were able to stalk and "launch a torpedo" on one of their carriers.<br><br>The reason why AIP subs are superior:<br>1) Conventional diesel subs have a weakness, they need to snorkel to renew their air. If not the air is too stale in the submarines, thus about one a week they need to surface to snorkel.<br>2)AIP subs carry pure oxygen tanks to substitute the air. They carry enough air to allow it to remain submerged for up to 8 weeks.<br>3) they are quieter than nuclear subs.</div>

Re-charging is done by running the generators onboard which needs air. If the submarine did not snorkel while charging batteries, the air supply in the submarine will be depleted very fast and the crew will die of suffocation. This is suspected to be what happened to the China Ming class sub 371 in yellow sea in 2003.<br><br>Of course, you also get a chance to ventilate the sub, but thats not the main reason.<br><br>All AIP sub carries liquid oxygen in tanks (and hydrogen in tanks in the case of fuel cells AIP) so that the AIP engines do not need to breath air for combustion.</div>

Yes you read me correctly. So i guess we must have been training on the subs. This is because only the Vastorgotland subs and Gotland subs are suitable for both baltic and warm waters.

Yes you read me correctly. So i guess we must have been training on the subs. This is because only the Vastorgotland subs and Gotland subs are suitable for both baltic and warm waters.

Seriously, the Sjoormen class subs are used only as a training platform for singapore.<br>The vastorgotland class are Air Indpendent Propulsion submarines. It is thought that singapore will get two of them from Sweden. This subs are new in submarine terms. The subs are launched in 1987-1990. The new subs are a major destabilizing factor as we will be the only ones operating AIP subs in the region.  It is also expected that singapore will get the eurotorp 2000.<br>Each of ther subs are expected to cost about 300 million.<br>Actually, it is suspected that Singapore crew is already training on it.<br>Recently, Singapore participated in a navy exercise in the pacific as part of the swedish contingent. Apparently, our crew surprised the Americans as we were able to stalk and "launch a torpedo" on one of their carriers.<br><br>The reason why AIP subs are superior:<br>1) Conventional diesel subs have a weakness, they need to snorkel to renew their air. If not the air is too stale in the submarines, thus about one a week they need to surface to snorkel.<br>2)AIP subs carry pure oxygen tanks to substitute the air. They carry enough air to allow it to remain submerged for up to 8 weeks.<br>3) they are quieter than nuclear subs. </div></blockquote>Apparently heard that they sneaked into the CBG and was in periscope AND firing range of the Carrier.And that was with the Sjoormens only.</div>
