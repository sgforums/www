In fact the greatest strength of the game was how they overcame the AI limitations.  If each AI soldier acted on their own, they would be more than easy to take out by a human player.  BUT because they moved together as a squad, and executed their squad movements, they became a fierce fighting platform.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>If you haven't played blitzkrieg before go get it! The game might not be available in Singapore because i bought it in Australia. The game's got all major weapons from WW2. It plays in a 3/4 top-down look like warcraft and c &amp; c. You cannot possibly rush the enemy as you have limited infantry and tanks in the beginning. Tactics is important and artillery is very important.<br><br>The artillery really fires from one end of map to the other. Plus u must deploy and transport around using  trucks. Depending on the calibre, they have different ranges, damage, firing rate and deployment rate. Plus the game also adds counter-artillery fire because when enemy artillery fires on u... the map will show the approximate location of the batteries. So u have to choose a suitable artillery platform. They have self-propelled and towed howitzers as well as primitive MRLS.<br><br>Tanks have different armor values, gun damage and pentrative values. As usual the frontal armor is strongest and the back is the weakest. Some tanks are bigger and heavier then others... this is very apparent when u compare the German panzers with the allied ones. The allied missions are freakin difficult because ur shermans cannot possibly take on panthers and tigers head on. U have to flank them.<br><br>Infantry in this game are not cannon fodder. They can dig trenches and fortify a position. they can enter buildings... stop tanks by destroying the tracks... sometimes infantry can capture anti gun platforms and aa guns after killing the crew. Scouts/snipers when proned cannot be seen by the enemy unless they're really close, they can snipe and takeout AA guns so that you can follow on with an air-strike. They can use their binoculars to extend vision.. basically they provide intelligence.<br><br>theres just too many features for me to name all of them. Its the best real time military strategy game ive played that accurately portrays real-life combat tactics. Its created by nival interactive and they will be releasing more WW2 strat games soon, cant wait for it.<br><br>Other games i played that were good are... Operation Flashpoint... Jane's USAF and Longbow series.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I think most of us have tried Call of Duty. It's fun, a total blast but not really realistic; a direct evolution of the Medal of Honour series. The scenarios are played like puzzles to be solved or are almost totally linear, the AI isn't as good as Op Flashpoint (or so it seemed to me). I won't deny the quality of the work though, it's definitely A+ with good entertainment values.<br><br>What it does really, really good is keeping the action uptempo with movie-style theatrics (Saving Private Ryan &amp; Enemy at the Gates(title?))<br><br>In other news, what in heaven's name was Portugal doing?!<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by the.raven:</div><div class="quote_body">u guys should try call of duty</div></blockquote></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Totally agree with V1NS@niTY. Blitzkrieg is great. At least much better than C&amp;C series.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>Used to play Close combat : A bridge too far..good game too..anybody know how much are the classics going for.?<br><br>Call of duty..to me, it's fun for the first few hours..then it gets boring. AI is stupid, realism lacks ..( germans can get up immediately after getting shot on the chest with an M1 gerand) But the game play is there, at least.<br><br>Nobody tried Ghost Recon? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_neutral.gif" alt="Neutral" title="Neutral"></div>
