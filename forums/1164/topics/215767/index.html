Charles Baxter, together with Dr. Rosemary Tan, CEO of<br>Veredus Laboratories, have evaluated the medical laboratory capabilities on board a U.S. Navy<br>afloat unit and determined that rapid testing for avian bird flu (H5N1) can be performed to<br>internationally recognized standard, ultimately saving lives. Dr. Tan has also conducted training<br>sessions for the Seventh Fleet command ship USS Blue RidgeÂ’s medical department on<br>laboratory procedures dealing with the H5N1 virus.<br><br>The ship-based avian flu testing laboratories will be using VeredusÂ’ avian flu H5N1 kit, which<br>has been developed and tested over the last few years. It is used to detect the pathogen as it is able<br>to detect minute amount of the RNA of the Avian Flu virus in infected humans or animals. This<br>highly specific and accurate test will give the laboratories the capability to rapidly identify the<br>H5N1 virus within hours.<br>The lab results and using the fleet response kits will allow the unit to perform the necessary<br>decontamination and disinfection procedures in the event of an on-board infection to provide<br>protection to unaffected crew members and prevent any possible spread of the virus into a port.<br>U.S. Seventh Fleet Surgeon Capt. Baxter added, Â“This laboratory test will help the shipsÂ’ overall<br>medical readiness and allow Seventh Fleet units to continue its mission with minimal operational<br>impact.<br><br>Having the ability to rapidly test and identify individuals infected with the H5N1 virus<br>will allow us to contain the spread of the virus in infected persons and allow us to focus our<br>medical resources more efficiently. With limited supplies of Tamiflu and no proven avian flu<br>vaccine, having this capability is paramount to Force Health Protection and will be critical in an<br>actual pandemic.Â”<br>Â“Currently the gold standard to confirm the H5N1 infection is by viral culture. This process takes<br>approximately 10 days once the specimen is received at a reference laboratory. There are also a<br>limited number of certified viral culture labs available worldwide. In a pandemic these labs<br>would quickly become overwhelmed and unable to meet regional demands. That could<br>significantly affect morbidity and mortality rates,Â” said Dr. Tan. Â“Molecular DNA analysis,<br>embodied in this H5N1 afloat test kit, is quickly becoming accepted as a very specific, sensitive<br>and accurate detection method in viral infection. This kit has been tested in parallel with viral<br>cultures of Avian Flu cases in Indonesia, Malaysia and Vietnam with excellent results.Â”<br><br>Â“Exploit Technologies is pleased that Veredus is able to leverage on world class research from<br>A*STAR researchers to develop a robust solution to address a global need to rapidly detect avian<br>flu,Â” said Mr. Boon Swan Foo, Managing Director of A*STAR and Executive Chairman of<br>Exploit Technologies Pte Ltd. Â“We are proud that Veredus is able to develop an afloat detection<br>test for the U.S. Navy.Â”<br><br>As the avian flu viruses are constantly mutating and changing, our double-checking test means<br>that we can provide a high degree of confidence and comfort to our end users when they use our<br>tests,Â” said Chua Chee Min, Managing Director of Veredus Laboratories.
