(should I miss out anything, forgive me.)<br><br>Some background info:<br>I'm a JC student.<br><br>So basically, most of my friends received their enlistment letters within the course of the past week and this week. And I've not gotten mine, rang MIW hotline up, machine tells me my enlistment date is yet to be confirmed, I will be mailed 2 months before my enlistment date, so I'm not expecting anything to be mailed to me in the next week either.<br><br>Am I to assume that I will be in the.. next batch or something?<br><br>What about being posted to navy, police, etc? I'm not too sure about this, but, I refuse to believe the posting is THAT random.<br><br></div>
