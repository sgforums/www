As such, we are now in a dilemma as the Government had spent so much on the purchase,Â” he told reporters after paying a visit to the manufacturing plant here yesterday.<br><br>Zainal Abidin said the ministry was in the midst of taking measures to address the problem.<br><br>Â“It will probe why there is no agreement with the company, DRB-Hicom Defence Technologies Sdn Bhd (Deftech), for the supply of spare parts.<br><br>Â“We view the matter seriously and will follow the development closely,Â” he said, adding that the ministry will work hand in hand with the relevant parties to find a solution.<br><br>Deftech had secured a RM1.1bil contract to supply 211 armoured carrier vehicle units Â– the ACV300 Adnan Â– to the army by August 2004.<br><br>Zainal Abidin said at present, minor parts could be purchased from the manufacturer but there was no agreement to procure the bigger components.<br><br>He admitted that the present situation would worsen if no action were taken to rectify the problem.<br><br>The rest of the vehicles were still under warranty and were being maintained by the manufacturer, he added.<br><br>http://thestar.com.my/news/story.asp?file=/2006/2/9/nation/13344305&amp;sec=nation<br></div>

We are in the midst of buying the track pad spare parts,Â” deputy army chief Lt Jen Datuk Wira Mohammed Ismail Jamaluddin said.<br><br>He said in a statement yesterday that the spare parts for the ACVs needed to go through stringent testing before they could be fitted on the vehicles.<br><br>On Wednesday, Deputy Defence Minister Datuk Zainal Abidin Zin spoke of the unused ACVS, which were bought three years ago for RM1.2bil.<br><br>He said they were lying idle due to difficulties in getting spare parts because the purchase agreement did not have a clause for maintenance and supply of the parts.<br><br>Lt Jen Mohammad Ismail said the army was aware of a Â“slight delayÂ” in securing the spare parts, adding that the tests would be completed this month.<br><br>The spare parts, he said, were from a local manufacturer.<br><br>Meanwhile, Opposition Leader Lim Kit Siang said Defence Minister Datuk Seri Najib Tun Razak must explain why the purchase agreement of the ACVs had no clause for maintenance and the supply of spare parts.<br><br>Â“What has Najib got to say about gross ineptitude and irresponsibility of Defence Ministry officials, or is no one to bear any responsibility for such professional negligence?Â” he asked in a statement.<br><br>Lim cited a report from the July 2004 edition of the JaneÂ’s Defence Weekly, which stated that the Turkish-produced Adnan 300 Series ACVs were equipped with the Baktar Shikan anti-tank guided weapon from Pakistan.</div>

Adnan IFV may not be considered as a potent combat vehicle but if THEY apply this experience to their PT-91 (Now, THIS is what I considered as a Potent Vehicle in this region) with ample stocks of spares,  then we better stick our neck out longer....  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_eek.gif" alt="Shocked" title="Shocked"><br><br></div>
