            <div class='col-md body'>Another issue is that of magazine compatibility.<br><br>SAF's SAR-21 uses a proprietary magazine that is not compatible with the M-16/M203 and Ultimax-100. (Though a version using the M-16 mag is available.)<br><br>The logistic side of this situation must be undesirable - especially with SAF penchant for standardisation.<br><br>I think it is a great idea to have a translucent plastic magazine for visibility of rounds remaining.<br><br>But, with out incredible ability at making arms, isn't it possible to make a plastic mag that is compatible with the M-16?</div>

But the Utimax must be the more accurate platform for full-auto fire as the recoil is so minimal.<br><br>On another thread, someone mentioned that the SAR-21 had less IA at atp detail (what's that?) - compared to the Ultimax.<br><br>This could be several reasons:<br><br>* At the time, the SAR-21 was firing semi-auto. The Ultimax was firing full-auto bursts.<br><br>* The Ultimax used for training are about 10 over years old. The SAR-21 are brand new.<br><br>Still, I agree that the craftsmanship of the Ultimax (I have fired) is really shoddy and leaves much to be desired. And IA like double feeding is very common. And the Ultimax is hopeless at firing blanks so SAW gunners all use "universal rounds" - bang bang bang bang....</div>

The SAR-21 overall length is only 80.5cm vs 98.6cm for the M-16S1. It is  18cm shorter.<br><br>But is that a lot? I just picked up a ruler and 18cm is about the distance from my wrist to my fingertip. Not a lot.<br><br>To give up a good conventional for a heavier, inconvenient to use bullpup... I really don't think it is worth it.<br><br>In terms of handling, ergonomics, balance, reloading speed etc bullpups especially the SAR-21 fails.<br><br>But, I feel the bigger problem isn't whether the new weapon is a bullpup or not. The big problem is that the new weapon's magazine isn't compatible with the M-16. And as I mentioned, the M-16 magazine continues to be issued for the M-16/M-203 and the Ultimax.<br><br>So you have a logistic situation not encountered since the adoption of the M-16S1.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>WOw ! more guns discussion.... I would say lets look at the fundamental flaws of the M16,M4 system... we have a very weak magazine system, the follower and spring and angle makes guns prone to jamming becasue of poor mag design.  HK found that out on the SA-80 for the british and basically redsign the M16 magazine!  Unless SIngapore adopt the new magazines, I would say SAR21 using a better design magazine may be a good idea.<br><br>2ns, M16 direct gas system is a major flaw in the gun systm.. I can attest to this because of the amount of M4/M16 firing in both FA and burst and semi... in lots of competition , if the weapon is not clean after prolong firing, your FA burst can come slower and slower, becasue carbon built up where the dirt foul gas is dumped into the bolt carrier! and my god the crystalized carbon that you have to remove after firing with some wire brush.<br><br>SAR21 uses a piston based system thus keeping the rifle relatively easy to maintain! just like my AK74, AUG, FAL etc etc.... Infact the M16A2 and M4 uses in Iraq is REQUIRED to be clean everyday in Iraq! and my freind simply have an AKMS in his humvee! and it pops everytime you pull the trigger ... and the guns have not been clean for months. Not saying AK need not be maintain but the better system would provide an easier maintainance schedule.<br><br>IN fact HK redesign the M4 system and here comes HK M416... a piston based M4 with some inetrnal modifications and a new M16 mags!<br><br>DaveC!</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I think he could be refering to the barrel of the grenade launcher itself - not the barrel of the rifle. The barrels of the grenade launchers I've seen on the SAR21 are a little shorter than the standard M203 GL.</div>
