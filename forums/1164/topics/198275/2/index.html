            <div class='col-md body'>The problem with the quadrant sight is that you often have to aim off which obviously makes accuracy an issue.<br><br>Sure, practice makes perfect, but then why bother having the quadrant sight then?  I can practice with the leaf sight till I get really accurate results with it too.<br><br>This way can do away with a contraption that makes the rifle harder to carry by hand, pokes you in the back when you sling it the "wrong" way and causes you to sign 1206 if you haven't taken extra care with its parts.</div>

I used to like the SIG-550 series a lot especially with all the rave reviews etc. But then I looked closely at the pictures and saw that the mag release is the AK-type. In fact, it looks like a weapon that's based loosely on the AK. Is this true?<br><br>Do you have a SIG-551 in your arsenal? I'm sure you have fired one...<br><br>What are some of the great things about the 551?</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>YEs! SIG 551 uses AK type mag release ! its all in the training! infact it gives a  positive lock on this kind of mag release ... thus we don;t have the problem like our M16 where it drops or did not sit properly! which is why we need a tap after each mag insert.<br><br>Yes it is loosly AK design ( thus the reliability) but the fit , craftsman and tolerance makes the accuracy!<br><br>The overall quality and make of the rifle is phenominal! non assualt rifle I have seeen is so well made ... its made like a swiss watch! .. its sight system is superiroor to our M16, accuracy is awesome....., reliability ( piston base) is very good, mag design is much more superior, you can clip them together, don;t jam easily like out cheaply made M16 mags!, sturdy and feel and very rugged!  winter trigger design that ease usage in winter conditions!, it is pretty IMHO<br><br>the only downside of the SIG is , its EXPENSIVE, does not have adjustable buttstock length to ease body armour and other SBO device , a little heavier than our M4. Ergonomics is not as good as the M4.<br><br>I can go on! but you get what I mean! overall, it is all rounder type Assualt rifle.<br><br>maybe a new HK made M416 or some piston based M4 might change my mind in future!<br><br>DaveC</div>
