            <div class='col-md body'>This topic keeps coming up. There is no technology in the world that is designed in isolation. Every new technology is based on something else in the past, particularly for mature technologies like military hardware. No matter what weapon you are looking at, you will ALWAYS be able to say that it is "based on" something else, or "copied from" something else. This is true for any country's weapons, even the latest US hardware.<br><br>The real question is HOW MUCH did Singapore add to previous technology. "How much" meaning how much improvement in efficiency the improvements create, and how innovative the differences are. In most of the weapon systems we use, the improvements have been very significant. For example, the Endurance class LPDs have a unique arrestor system on the heli pads that allow the helicopters to launch and land even when the deck is 45 degrees from horizontal, allowing heli-ops to occur in all sea states. The SAR-21 is the first rifle to be fielded in any army which uses permanently factory zeroed sights, and has a unique mechanism that lowers peak recoil.<br><br>We Singaporeans have a weird tendency to look down on things from our own country. We get a little help to build something or the design uses elements from another and straight away it is just a copy of something else. This is true for many things, not just weapons. I will never understand this "reverse patriotism" that many Singaporeans exhibit -- so different from people elsewhere. Other people praise our technology (the Marines are thinking of buying Ultimaxes to replace their Minimis), but we must be ashemed of it. Can't get it...</div>
