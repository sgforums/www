We hardly need to <span style="font-style: italic;">invent</span>--from scratch, as it were--the required item. We need to know the technology, to be able to apply it, to be able to manufacture stuff locally, i.e., to have access to stuff without having to be at the mercy of a foreign supplier. But that's quite different from having to <span style="font-style: italic;">invent</span> something totally new--at least not in every case.<br><br>Cheers</div>

What matters is what works, and what provides good egronomics, in which the ray-gun polymer bulpups have been a solid design to base our weapon on.<br><br>But it is not deniable that these two rifles are similar... it will probably be better expressed that the SAR-21 is inspired, rather then a copy of the TAR-21. It can't be called a copy any more then the Panther tank is a copy of the Soviet T-34.<br><br>Of course, we could have traded notes with the Israelis on the development of our respective rifles, but I don't think that's something the brass would discuss openly...</div>
