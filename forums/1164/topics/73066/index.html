It is reportedly equipped with Israeli and Russian avionics and the AI31F turbofan engine from Russia. The J-10's radar and fire control system is reportedly the Israeli-made ELM-2021 system, which can  simultaneously track six air targets and maintain a weapons lock on four. The plane is said to have capabilities similar to the Su-27, the Russian MiG-29 as well as the F-16, but with an estimated cost of less than $10 million, it could rival other jet makers on the international market.<br><br>Red Chinese J-10 Aircraft</div>

China and Israel started collaboration in the early 1980's and full-scale co-operation was underway by 1984.
