            <div class='col-md body'>I would not give much credence to an article that has made a couple of glaring and basic errors. Singapore`s CAF would not be making those mistakes. That makes me wonder if he added his own ideas. Who is the writer anyway? Have not heard about him previously. Maybe not.<br><br>If you recall, Singapore has already expressed a need for (up to)80 frames in total about 3 years ago in an interview with Janes.  The new jets are meant to replace the super Skyhawks and F-5E(partially or as a whole). Of course, the latter is dependant on the status of the F-35 project.  What that means is that Singapore is prepared to purchase a lot of air-crafts to replace both the sky-hawks and F-5Es.<br><br>Come on, the only reason Singapore buys in small batches is because of the sensitivity; internally and externally. Remember when we bought 70 F-16s in stages. If SIA can splurge billions at one go to buy dozens of new planes, you would not think that Singapore Inc will be in a hard position to buy fighter jets that cost just as much or less.<br><br>It is pretty obvious that the F-35s will only come in the next decade. It does not make sense to make an order now for a plane to materialize next decade. And it does not make sense to buy a plane as a 'stop-gap' to last a few more years that is less capable than the F-15SGs and F-35s. I believe that  RSAF`s investments in newer F-16s are over. The future lies in the F15SGs and F-35s. And if you look at the numbers extrapolated by the RSAF, it becomes clear that we would, in fact, be buying more F-15SGs. I think around 40-50 in total would be purchased eventually as shotgun has already said. All the more so since more countries in SEA will be operating Su-30s in our area of operations. We have to bear in mind that Singapore will not allow other countries in our region to achieve some sort of parity with the RSAF; numbers or capability. The only reason that the number of frames has dipped in recent years is because of the abysmmal condition of the MAF and Indo AF. Of course, there is also the new China and balance of power.<br><br>Moreover, I recalled reading that the F-5Es are good till about 2013-2014. Of course, this does not mean that we should wait till they are dropping from the skies but that says a lot about the urgency to replace them.<br><br>And I do not think that there will be any more new competition. I remembered Prof Lui from DSTA saying that during one of the AA. It will just be either the F-35s or F-15SGs. And since the F-35s will be late, it is highly likely that the new planes will be F-15SGs. I believe that the next batch of F-15s will be purchased next year. I think around the `newsy' period during Singapore Airshow 2007. I do not think that the next batch is meant to replace the F-5Es but to replace the Super skyhawks or an upgrading of capability to match newer threats; no matter the amount of spin they put into it.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>The talk about the Sukhois outmatching all the other air-crafts out there is rubbish. They are based on DACT exercises that has got nothing to do with one on one encounter to see which plane is better. Only misinformed nationalist users would parade them as the best there is.

            <div class='col-md body'>Buying F-16s as a stop-gap measure would still entail the latest systems(like AESA) to make it as closely viable as the real thing.  That would increase the price per unit. But that would still make it a less capable platform than a F15SG.<br><br>It does not make sense to do that. You might as well get a more suitable and better platform and use it for as long as it can be used. If maintainence cost is the only factor, we would not have chosen the F-15SGs in the first place but another F-16 variant.  There are viable trade-offs and needs.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Personally...I believe still that we will get more Vipers based on the fact that operating cost per unit is lower, and we get greater bang for our buck. A F16 though may be less "advanced" and upgradable den the F15, it no doubt is still a competant aircraft. What we want is first strike capability, a higher number of F16s in the air will gurantee that. No doubt the Sukhois that are entering our region are capable, but their numbers are far too low to actually present a significant threat to the Vipers we have. That's the key...overwhelm and destroy.<br><br>"Thus it is that in war the victorious strategist only seeks battle after the victory has been won, whereas he who is destined to defeat first fights and afterwards looks for victory. " quoted from Sun Tzu. Yes it may be nice to have the hottest sleekest toy on the market...but is it practical? And does it get the job done? Or are there alternatives on the market that is more value for money? Its not as if by getting more Vipers, our doctrine is to simply let the opposing Air Forces run out of missiles and rounds for their guns before we engage them, but simply because you have more planes to attack 1 plane, the more pressure there is. Its like being marked on the soccer field...same logic, different places. As such...my money is still on Vipers and with whatever spare money going into avionics and weapons systems upgrade, possibly getting of even more advanced weaponry.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>The F-15SGs can remain viable for a long time still. Can our Blk 52/54 vipers be viable in the long run(say post 2015)against newer opponents ? We would not buy Vipers for them to last less than ten years and watch them become obsolete. And you would need newer planes to operate and synergise better with newer over-arching systems like the CAEWs.<br><br>If you are looking at the newer vipers, I think they can cost as much as &gt; $60 million a pop with AESA, CFTs, etc.  You might as well get the F-15SGs which has greater range(hence more flexibility), greater carriage and a more powerful(second only to the F-22`s radar i think) AESA radar.<br><br>UAE`s 80 Blk 60 vipers which comes with the latest avionics(including AESA) and systems cost as much as 8 billion USD in 2000(excluding inflation). Are you willing to fork out that much money when you can get just as many F-15s which would increase your capabilities significantly?  Why do you think the latest F-16s were dropped during the competition? We could have gone for an all F-16 fleet. But we did not.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote>No doubt the Sukhois that are entering our region are capable, but their numbers are far too low to actually present a significant threat to the Vipers we have.</blockquote>That`s 18 sukhois from Malaysia and 12(?) in Indonesia with more to come surely; especially from the Indonesian side. 30 Sukhois in total. Nope. Id put my faith in more F-15SGs rather than the current 12 + 8 we have opted for. Times are changing. The aerial strategic balance is changing as well. Where we can be contented with F-16s versus poorly run airforces with planes that can hardly fly, we would have to contend with leading fighter jets of the new century.   Of course, there is always China and India and the need to help keep the balance of powers in SEA.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I personally doubt the capabilities of our region SU...<br><br>Don't fire me on this, SU is a great piece of hardware, but the software is as important. training, strategies development, tactics, maintenance, optimise in the utilisation of the avionics, etc, etc. All contributes to the how potent this weapons will be in the battle space.<br><br>The network warfare system that SAF has developed (I am really confident in) has greatly multiply the existing force by many times over. So is there really a need to have such big number of advance fighters ???<br><br></div>
