            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by FireAndHell:</div><div class="quote_body">A coincidence perhaps.....but this announcement comes at a time when the Isrealis have recently concluded an undetected swoop onto syrian territory to bomb a certain target w/o being detected until it's over.<br><br>Perhaps it has proven the true capability of the F16s and F15s that an "old" workhorse with the right pilots and enhancements to the plane can still go into enemy territory with impunity. That's what RSAF may be looking for and it has proven itself !!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz"> </div></blockquote>The true capacity of the F-15 &amp; F-16 is when they are deep into enemy territory, or on extended endurance air patrol  that is in line with SAF stategy - bring the fight to the enemy and not fight on home ground.<br><br>Extract from a australia analyst article on why in Typhoon even with agile ability in supersonic flight in some situation will lost the fight to F-15.<br>" The clean Typhoon, with 50% internal gas and 6-8 AAMs is firmly in the class of the F100-PW-229 powered F-15F, on dry thrust, and about 15% behind the F-15F on reheat. Where the Typhoon falls behind the F-15F is when its operating radius is stretched and additional external gas is being carried. If we take a Typhoon with 3 x 1000L external tanks, and an F-15F with 2 x 600 USG external tanks, we have configurations which deliver very similar endurance and operating radius for a point intercept. In the latter situation, approaching the target, the Typhoon is around 12% behind the F-15F in critical reheated thrust/weight ratio. If we compare a Typhoon with CFTs, 3 x 1000L external tanks against an F-15F with only CFTs, we get a shortfall of about 20% in thrust/weight ratio in addition to the drag penalty of the external tanks. These are very approximate estimates, not accounting for combat gas, but even doing a very accurate simulation would yield the inevitable conclusion - an F/A-18 sized fighter, no matter how agile when clean, cannot compete in thrust/weight ratio with an F-15 sized fighter at extended operating radii. "<br><br>Also note that Typhoon does not have the low level terrain peneration &amp; range and load capability of the F-15, F-16 and rafale.<br><br>So we should be glad that we got the F-15SG and F-16 instead of Euro fighter.<br><br>Eurofighter was design by British - basically influence by history - UK survive is because their fighters squarons win the dog fight battle with germany fighter over the sea .... that why they wanted a good air to air typhoon with great agile and only need to fight nearer to home.<br><br>But US - is a plane that may not be the best but have the long leg - Mustang which turn the tide and win the war.  The Mustang, when equipped with drop-tanks, for the first time allowed heavy bombers to be escorted deep into Germany and back by fighters and greatly decreased losses as a result. When Luftwaffe chief Hermann Goring spotted a Mustang over Berlin he said Â“the war is lostÂ” Â– he was not wrong<br><br>Thus if we look at F-15SG - it is the best  choice something that bring the fight to enemy and its performance over far out enemy terrority is better then any other aircraft even in air fight.<br><br>Unless we want to do our air fight closer to home , then eurofighter will then be the better choice.</div>

Carlo Kopp?) </span> in his analyst between the Typhoon &amp; the Eagle.  And if he (or she) was so spot on, why didn't the RAAF chiefs discounted the Eagle earlier on and yet ordered the Rhino as the interim (replacement of the The Pig) pending the introductory of the Lighting II into RAAF service?

Don't forget, the Typhoon is a joint project by 4 countries (UK, Germany, Italy &amp; Spain).  The Brits may be comfortable with the Typhoon being short-legged as Britain itself is an island separated from continental Europe.  But the Germans?  Spanish? Italians?  They have shared borders and I seriously doubt they are comfortable with meeting any potential aerial adversary just outside their airspace.<br><br>Btw, UK 'survived' (I think you are referring to the Battle of Britain?) not b'cos of the advantageous in the short-legged capability of the Spifires &amp; Hurricanes then.  The Brits are forced to operate close &amp; take on the Luftwaffe as they (the former) don't have a choice in both the Spits/Hurricane numbers vs Luftwaffe numbers arrayed against them!  And don't forget the very shortfall in pilots available to the RAF in early 1940.  No doubt the RAF operated over own territory, it also meant that shot-down RAF pilots could be quickly returned to their bases and get into the fight again, as compared to downed Luftwaffe pilots who baled out over England and will see their fighting days over as they will be sent straight to POW camps in either England or shipped to Canada.  In addition, RAF were lucky as the short-legged Luftwaffe could only operate from France and from Norway (bombers only w/o figher escort).  But in today's scanario, with the advent of stand-off missiles &amp; long-legged fighters/bombers (in the class of the Flankers/Blackjet/Backfires) coupled with AAR, the RAF will not be facing an an enemy that sufferred from the limits that faced the Luftwaffe of the 1940s.  Btw, traditionally the scope of (patrol) ops for RAF is the GIUK (Greenland-Iceland-UK) gap, and that's where Tornado F-3 long range was appreciated.  Come on, I don't think any decent fighter pilots would like multiple AAR attempts esp in a hot job, surely no one wants to be caught with their pants down when the enemy pops-up when in the 'act' of AAR!  <strong>Any pilots here want to disagree with me? </strong><br><br>Personally, by the time the RAF meets any aggressor near their shore, I'll be worried that do they (esp those in non-STOVL types) have a place to land after their encounter in the air or they can still identify whatever is left of London.<br><br>Yes, the Mustang helped to war the war over Germany BUT not b'cos it has the range but alot of other factors. eg the Luftwaffe senior leadership had always treated the Luftwaffe as a tactical AF rather than a Strategic AF etc.  Tactical as the German Army commanders had always treated the Luftwaffe as a flying artillery to help the army in its blitzkreig.  Like after bombing, the softened-land targets will be immediately exploited by a ground army.  But when come to the Battle of Britain, w/o a land army, no matter how hard the Luftwaffe pounded the UK land defences, such acts is considered fruitless &amp; pointless as the short gains could not be exploited on the ground therefore it became simply as an aerial attrition that took a beating as RAF Spits/Hurricanes could pounce on returning fuel-starved 109 pilots.<br><br>The fact is no doubt the Typhoon was derived in the 1980s, but along the years it was evolved to meet futures threats esp it wqas evolved to be super manoevorable to meet the SU-27/30 series.  And mind you, dogfights don't happen in high Mach numbers but more in subsonic speeds.  If give me to select between the victor between a Tphoon/Flanker encounter (discounting BVR missile enagements), I would pick the Typhoon having a very slight edge over the Flanker.  And how about an Eagle/Flanker engagement? errrr......<br><br>Therefore, I seriously doubt the Typhoon to be considered just a short-legged fighter and I don't think the current RAF planners share the same myopic vision that plagued the 1940s Luftwaffe in having a short-legged Typhoon.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"><br><br>P/s I had came across an Int'l Avaiation mag report that there was an incident that happened in UK airpace during that time when the Typhhon was being delivered for trials and apparently 2 Lakenhealth-based Eagles decide to takle on the 'newbies' and they (Eagle pilots) came out shock over the engagement...now I'm not sure did this engagement did take place but apparently this 'piece' of info was suppressed by the official media.<br><br></div>

The single-seat version of the E?<br><a href="http://www.patricksaviation.com/wiki/F-15F" rel="nofollow">http://www.patricksaviation.com/wiki/F-15F</a><br><br>Now I must admit I'm no expert in the stats provided by this Aussie Analyst (<span style="font-style: italic;">who?  Carlo Kopp?) </span> in his analyst between the Typhoon &amp; the Eagle.  And if he (or she) was so spot on, why didn't the RAAF chiefs discounted the Eagle earlier on and yet ordered the Rhino as the interim (replacement of the The Pig) pending the introductory of the Lighting II into RAAF service?  But hey, this topic should not be discussed here in this thread.....so I would take this OZ analyst reporting with a pinch of salt.<br><br>Anyway, the Typhoon is NOT a design dictated by the Brits and its capability defined by them only.  Don't forget, the Typhoon is a joint project by 4 countries (UK, Germany, Italy &amp; Spain).  The Brits may be comfortable with the Typhoon being short-legged as Britain itself is an island separated from continental Europe.  But the Germans?  Spanish? Italians?  They have shared borders and I seriously doubt they are comfortable with meeting any potential aerial adversary just outside their airspace.<br><br>Btw, UK 'survived' (I think you are referring to the Battle of Britain?) not b'cos of the advantageous in the short-legged capability of the Spifires &amp; Hurricanes then.  The Brits are forced to operate close &amp; take on the Luftwaffe as they (the former) don't have a choice in both the Spits/Hurricane numbers vs Luftwaffe numbers arrayed against them!  And don't forget the very shortfall in pilots available to the RAF in early 1940.  No doubt the RAF operated over own territory, it also meant that shot-down RAF pilots could be quickly returned to their bases and get into the fight again, as compared to downed Luftwaffe pilots who baled out over England and will see their fighting days over as they will be sent straight to POW camps in either England or shipped to Canada.  In addition, RAF were lucky as the short-legged Luftwaffe could only operate from France and from Norway (bombers only w/o figher escort).  But in today's scanario, with the advent of stand-off missiles &amp; long-legged fighters/bombers (in the class of the Flankers/Blackjet/Backfires) coupled with AAR, the RAF will not be facing an an enemy that sufferred from the limits that faced the Luftwaffe of the 1940s.  Btw, traditionally the scope of (patrol) ops for RAF is the GIUK (Greenland-Iceland-UK) gap, and that's where Tornado F-3 long range was appreciated.  Come on, I don't think any decent fighter pilots would like multiple AAR attempts esp in a hot job, surely no one wants to be caught with their pants down when the enemy pops-up when in the 'act' of AAR!  <strong>Any pilots here want to disagree with me? </strong><br><br>Personally, by the time the RAF meets any aggressor near their shore, I'll be worried that do they (esp those in non-STOVL types) have a place to land after their encounter in the air or they can still identify whatever is left of London.<br><br>Yes, the Mustang helped to war the war over Germany BUT not b'cos it has the range but alot of other factors. eg the Luftwaffe senior leadership had always treated the Luftwaffe as a tactical AF rather than a Strategic AF etc.  Tactical as the German Army commanders had always treated the Luftwaffe as a flying artillery to help the army in its blitzkreig.  Like after bombing, the softened-land targets will be immediately exploited by a ground army.  But when come to the Battle of Britain, w/o a land army, no matter how hard the Luftwaffe pounded the UK land defences, such acts is considered fruitless &amp; pointless as the short gains could not be exploited on the ground therefore it became simply as an aerial attrition that took a beating as RAF Spits/Hurricanes could pounce on returning fuel-starved 109 pilots.<br><br>The fact is no doubt the Typhoon was derived in the 1980s, but along the years it was evolved to meet futures threats esp it wqas evolved to be super manoevorable to meet the SU-27/30 series.  And mind you, dogfights don't happen in high Mach numbers but more in subsonic speeds.  If give me to select between the victor between a Tphoon/Flanker encounter (discounting BVR missile enagements), I would pick the Typhoon having a very slight edge over the Flanker.  And how about an Eagle/Flanker engagement? errrr......<br><br>Therefore, I seriously doubt the Typhoon to be considered just a short-legged fighter and I don't think the current RAF planners share the same myopic vision that plagued the 1940s Luftwaffe in having a short-legged Typhoon.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"><br><br>P/s I had came across an Int'l Avaiation mag report that there was an incident that happened in UK airpace during that time when the Typhhon was being delivered for trials and apparently 2 Lakenhealth-based Eagles decide to takle on the 'newbies' and they (Eagle pilots) came out shock over the engagement...now I'm not sure did this engagement did take place but apparently this 'piece' of info was suppressed by the official media.<br><br>[/b]</blockquote>Britain survived the battle of britain for a number of reasons.<br><br>One, they operated over friendly territory, and had then, sophisticated radar systems that permitted them to intercept the Germans. Their pilots that were shot down could be picked up, patched up, and sent back to their squadrons.  Luftwaffe pilots were either captured or worst, froze to death in the Channel.<br><br>Second.  Like you said, the Germans had a tactical air force, not a Strategic one.  Luftwaffe escorts had limited fuel that they could only engage or fend off the Brits for short period of time before returning back to base.  German bombers were also less effective in the role they were supposed to play.<br><br>Third, a less known detail. The luftwaffe expended much of their veteran flight instructors over the Netherlands in transport planes.  Many of them were shot down, and valuable flight instruction experience lost.<br><br>Britain was rather useless in contributing to the Strategic bombing campaign over Nazi Germany simply cause their fighters couldn't escort the bombers all the way.  It was until the Mustang showed up, where the Americans were able to have their bombers escorted all the way to the target area and back.<br><br>Personally, I wouldn't give the Typhoon's agility too much credit in modern air warfare.  Most people who follow up in this, or even if you ask Air Force officers who are senior enough will tell you that no one wants to press for a merge.  Especially if you are numerically inferior. Hence, it is unrealistic to discount BVR engagements.<br><br>Secondly, high off-boresight weapons such as the Sidewinder X, R-73 makes agility less of any issue.  As usual, superior turn rate is preferred over the ability to sustain a high-aoa-energy bleeding turn.  If they don't kill in that turn, they are in trouble. Even if you get shot by one of these missiles, that little agility edge isn't going to save you.<br><br>As for whether the RAF planners are myopic, I wouldn't say that.  But I'd say that they are politically committed typhoon already, and cannot back out.  Besides, its not a totally lousy plane or anything.  It serves its purpose as a dual role fighter, and has exceptional handling.  No reason to call the Brits myopic.<br><br>Neither is there any reason to deem the F-15SG to be incapable of handling flanker threats.  You can't kill what you can't lock.  Its not stealth, but it has the next best thing, powerful jammers.<br><br></div>

You seem to alway ignore the fact that the moment you eject the tanks , you will not have enough fuel to ferry flight home !!!<br><br>Ok then you just prove my point !!! F-15 with conformal tanks can fight it out and come back ....!!! Typhoon have to eject it's tanks to fight, but then in the process it does have enough onboard fuel to come back !!!  - this is not a question of who is the better fighter my friend, it is the question of internal, conformal fuel loading capacity !!!<br><br>Please do not use F-15A to compare with euro fighter !!! F-15E is a redesign with structure changes and improvement + better engine !!!<br><br>1st flight date of F-15E is 11th December 1986<br>1st flight date of EAP (eurofighter) August 1986<br><br>They are actually not that far apart in development dates - except people mistakenly use F-15A first flight date to compare with eurofighter !!!<br><br>So you are saying all things new must be better then new ones - very dumb comments ... !!! Every plane have its good and bad !!! I am just mention a weakness in eurofighter - and here you are like a spoilt kid jump up and down screamming no way !!! Grow up, everything has a weakness - the eurofighter was design to be a top air to air plane it be stupid to put a big internal fuel tank inside to reduce its performance !! While a F-15 is for long range mission -thus it give up some air to air performance for super huge tanks !!!<br><br></div></blockquote>Estimation of the distance and amount of fuel usage is critical. Jetison the drop tank,u still have the internal fuel to send u back if yr estimation is well planned.<br><br></div>
