"We have decided on three aircraft to meet Japan's next-generation fighter requirements. But the F-22 is a modern, hi-tech fighter - so yes, of course, we are very interested. But of lot of things would need to be cleared before we would have a chance of acquiring the F-22."</div>

At some point maybe yes, but not now."<br>-Chris Chadwick, VP and General Manager Global Strike Systems, Boeing -- June 19th, 2007, Aviation Week Show News,</blockquote><a href="http://www.nxtbook.com/nxtbooks/mh/paris062007/index.php?startpage=36" rel="nofollow">http://www.nxtbook.com/nxtbooks/mh/paris062007/index.php?startpage=36</a><br><br><blockquote>Boeing is also offering a mix of Super Hornets and Eagles to Japan. The Japan Air Self-Defense Force has a requirement to replace its upgraded F-4EJ Kai Phantoms, however Japan is pushing strongly to acquire the F-22 Raptor--an aircraft that is far from being a Phantom replacement. Apart from the extraordinary cost, the greatest obstacle to Japan's F-22 plans is a formal U.S. prohibition on exports.<br>"We just don't see the Congressional ban being lifted," Kronenbert told Show News.[/b] "A few months ago (U.S. Deputy Secretary of Defense) Gordon England told Australia that the F-22 would not be released for international sale. Also the Defense Security Co-operation Agency has said that it would take $1 billion in non-recurring costs just to redesign the aircraft for a co-production release in Japan. That's really problematic and it would take three or four years just to figure out how to do that.<br>"An F-22 refusal has to be figured into their thinking, even thought it's not directed against Japan specifically. But the bar is not going be lifted and F-22 production comes to an end in 2009 or 2010 so that in itself was always going to be a problem for their program."<br>-Excerpt from "Boeing IDS Looks to Asia for Growth" by Robert Hewson, Aviation Week Show News, June 20th 2007,</blockquote></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Noted: JASDF already operates F-15s.<br><br>I wouldn't be too surprised if the Japanese were to opt for F-15E/K/SG as well.  With their defense agency escalated to a full ministry, we might see more "force projection" capability build up, as well as induction of more "offensive" capabilities, such as the Strike Eagle.<br><br>They need the capability to strike-long, strike-far.  Most of their potential targets for strike requires them to fly over an expanse of water, hence a dual engine aircraft would be preferably.  The Jap MoD would be more than happy to accept a Strike Eagle deal if they can get their hands on the F-22s as well.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Typhoons for Japan<br><br>Frankly, I believed this public announcement by the Japanese on interest in the Typhoon is purely politics or simply put as .... indirect pressure on the US to release the Raptors to Japan.<br><br>I would believe the true Japanese intent on the Typhoon if:<br><br>(1) The Public Tender for new Fighters was won by the Typhoon consortium, &amp;<br>(2) The Contract (for Typhoons) is signed.<br><br>Remember, the Japanese have publicly discounted the Rafale on the ground that '<span style="font-style: italic;">it is a difficult to maintain (of the Rafale)'</span>....this I believe is more a refection of the no experience gained on maintaining/operating non-US fighters by the Japanese.  Look, the Japanese are aware that the Americans  will call them bluff if they mentioned Rafale but the Americans will stood up if the Typhoon is mentioned.<br><br>It will be just like after the Koreans had ordered the F-15K for their AF and a follow-on tender was announced, BAE and Dassault ignored this 2nd Tender as they suspected that the true Korean intent is to use their products to drive a bargaining chip with Boeing for price reduction for a F-15K follow-on order.<br><br>So, until I see the above 2 scenarios, I would take this Japanese public announcement on Typhoon as <span style="font-style: italic;">'yah' yah'</span>...</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>there is a political wild card consideration into F-35. but against we are talking about few years away. If next year election move to democrats. The US state department will be more likely to take human right policy as part of friendly countries. Any arms deals and release of sophiscation to foreign country may depended upon its relationship.  anyway many things could happen in between.<br><br></div>
