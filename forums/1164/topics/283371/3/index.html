That way, if you really need to drop those tanks, you won't lose fuel at all.<br><br>On strike missions, if a flight thats carrying air to ground ordinance and external fuel tanks usually will not merge.  Once AWACs informs them of a threat (aircraft known to have A2A capability) vectored towards them, they generally will opt to drag, take an Rmax shot if and scoot.  Any fighters on barcap or escorts will handle them instead.  They will probably hold on station somewhere until they are cleared in, if not abort.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>in my opinion, i think the f-35s are out for now as they are still pretty much in the development stages. it will take a while mre before we do see them attain operational status for US or UK. the stealth capability although a plus point but nt as stealthy as the F-22 raptor. plus the chinese n russian will come up with more  sophisticated radars to detect these aircrafts.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>The F-16Cs we have now are more than adequate to cover the interceptor role of the F-5s.  Hence, I think the RSAF would be looking at more tactical roles.  How to use our aerial superiority to best support the ground forces. I'm just worried the M'sians beat us to the SA-10s.</div>
