I do not regard thier airforces very highly. hehe. Take the Malaysians for example. The airforce and government should be sued numerous times over the deaths of countless pilots and servicemen due to shoddy servicing and derelict aircraft. You know that it is like so because even relatively newer aircrafts like the hawks are raining from the skies. A Sukhoi crash(god forbid) would literally turn the airforce into a practical joke.<br><br>But you are not going into battle with this presumption would you? So, I disagree with you in this respect.

The upgrades will begin in first quarter 2009.<br><br>The Raytheon APG-63(V)3 AESA radar combines the operationally-proven APG-63(V)2 AESA software and the revolutionary hardware advances of the F/A 18E/F Super Hornet's APG-79 AESA radar to create a high performance system that is reliable and affordable.<br><br>"The AESA radar greatly improves the Eagle pilot's situational awareness, targeting range and accuracy," said Jim Means, director of Proprietary Programs for Boeing Global Strike Systems.<br><br>The AESA radar will ensure the F-15Cs continue their combat-proven air supremacy well into the 21st century.

The Royal Saudi Air Force decision marks the first time an F-15 operator has switched engine models.<br><br>For more than 20 years, GE's F110 family has been the best-selling engine on single-engine F-16C/Ds worldwide, including in the Middle East. Recently, the F110 engine has made important progress in powering the twin-engine F-15. The F110 was first selected for 40 F-15K aircraft in 2002 by the Republic of Korea Air Force, followed by Singapore's selection last year for its new F-15SG fleet.<br><br>The F110 has considerable experience on the F-15. In 1999, the U.S. Air Force completed a highly successful field service evaluation of the F110-GE-129 powering the F-15, during which time the engine surpassed 1,900 engine flight-hours. First flight of the Korean F-15K occurred in early 2005.<br><br>"This is an important day in the history of the F110 engine program," said Russ Sparks, president of Military Engine Systems at GE Aviation. "For decades, GE has supported Royal Saudi Air Force aircraft, but this is an opportunity to power and support its front-line fighters."<br><br>The F110-GE-129 engine model to power the Royal Saudi aircraft incorporates GE's Service Life Extension (SLEP) hardware, which includes the core of a successful CFM56 commercial engine, 3D aero technology and upgrades to the combustor and high-pressure turbine. The enhancements can help provide up to a 25 percent improvement in cost-per-flying hour, a significant on-wing increase and elimination of special inspections.<br><br>GE Aviation, an operating unit of General Electric Company, is a world-leading provider of commercial and military jet engines and components as well as integrated digital, electric power, and mechanical systems for aircraft. GE Aviation also has a global service network to support these offerings.<br><br>..................................................................................................................<br><br>i say it again.

"But we at the Defence Ministry have not decided that it is absolutely necessary for Japan."<br><br>Ishiba said the strongest alternative among planes manufactured by other countries was the Eurofighter.<br><br>"The French Rafale is difficult to use. We certainly wouldn't choose a Russian fighter plane. So I think it would be the Eurofighter Typhoon," he said.<br><br>The Eurofighter is built by a consortium including BAE Systems (BAES.L: Quote, Profile , Research), Airbus parent firm EADS (EAD.PA: Quote, Profile , Research) and Alenia Aeronautica, a unit of Italy's Finmeccanica (SIFI.MI: Quote, Profile , Research).<br><br>Ishiba denied that U.S. reluctance to export the F-22 to Japan was linked to a leak of classified information relating to the joint U.S.-Japanese ballistic missile defence system. But he said Tokyo nevertheless needed to improve its handling of classified data.<br><br>A scandal erupted this year when Japanese naval officers were reported to have leaked classified information about the Aegis radar system used on U.S. and Japanese missile-defence capable ships.<br><br>"It is a fact that Aegis information was leaked. So I feel strongly that Japan's information management system is not good enough," Ishiba said, adding that tougher penalties and more reliable ways of detecting leaks were needed.<br><br>Â© Reuters 2007.
