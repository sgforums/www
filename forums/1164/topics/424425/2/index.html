              <p><br>Its not a question of modern but of capability. The airframe design may be dated but that has rarely been an issue for air combat. The aircraft being new builds are actually new. Both aircraft were designed for specific roles and excel at them. There are a number of capabilities built into the F-15SG that even the newer F-35s will not be able to fully replicate.</p>
              <p>The 60 year old B-52s and KC-135s are far older yet the last pilot to fly the aircraft probably hasn't even been born yet.</p>

              <p>It stuck to US planes for political reasons. It could have chosen the a "little" stealthy Eurofighter but instead chose an old plane in the form of the F-15E. Those are definitely not steathly.</p>
              <p>Non-plane wise the RSAF was comfortable enough to choose the Russian Igila over the American Stinger.</p>

              <p>Irrelevant discussion. The F-15SE features can be retrofitted which renders the F-15E with a significantly lower RCS than the typhoon.</p>
              <p>btw, the first link does not state that the rcs is lower. It does state that LO tech has been implemented. LO tech has been implemented on board F-15s since the 1970s eg LPI modes for F-15 radars. A phased array radar is as un-LO as it gets (unless its switched off). If you understood what an AESA + onboard F-15 EW does, one would understand the context of rcs discussions.</p>
              <p>the second link is a fan-site. Since its in German, it would be helpful if you can identify which part of it states a lower RCS pls.</p>

            <div class='col-md body'>It is foolish to purchase this expensive bomber.   Who are our likely enemies?  They are nearby, hence missiles, artillery are sufficient to incapacitate them.   The West (US, UK) are  differrent as they like intervention in other countries to show their prowess so that they can sell these military hardware.   So far after the WWII, the West have been attacking weak countries ( Afghanistan, Kosovo, Iraq, Libya which in my view, not a good match to gauge their military superiority.</div>

              <p>BJ, it can be used as a fighter too, and a fairly good one, though I do agree on the weaker countries part. We need a new bomber though as we retired our A-4s, so we have a job (ground support) but no plane to do it.</p>
              <p>Aircraft have two big advantages over indirect fire.</p>
              <p>1) The pilot actually "sees" or has radar contact with the target, so is much more likely to kill it, unlike artillery where you need a spotter to do target aquisition and BDA.</p>
              <p>2) A plane can loiter around an area and perform interdiction. Arty cannot as it has to move to avoid counter fire.</p>

              <p>You know, you have a real tendency to support the exotic or underdog option for the sake of being different / contrarian. You're willing to go the different way because it's the only hope of it being the smarter way.</p>
              <p>Which is cool if there aren't any very compelling reasons to the contrary.</p>
              <p>I've been there. Now I'm in my twenties and it's just not so cool anymore.</p>
              <p>You could field some incontestable arguments if you put your mind to it, but you're starting with the conclusions and not the reasons.</p>

              <p>Again incorrect. The F-15SG was pitched against all the best contemporary fighters available at that point in time (~yr 1999 to final selection in 2005). Unfortunately the fighters that weren't available included the F-35 and the F-22s.</p>
              <p>Neither the Rafale and Typhoon were sold with an AESA radar which I don't think you understand the benefits of. In terms of munitions load-out, avionics, pilot training, maintenance, performance, future upgrade path and sustainability, etc, all of which are clear the F-15SG comes up on top in areas where it matters to the RSAF.</p>
              <p>There are many reasons why the Rafale cannot find an external buyer and the Typhoon faces cuts from even its own users.</p>
              <p>You have confused the F-15SG with the leopard MBT purchase which is a 2nd hand purchase as opposed to a newbuild. Also you have confused the F-15SG with the F-15E. Much in the same way the current F-16D Blk 52+ are definitely different and much more advanced that the F-16s of 20 years ago.</p>

              <p>The Su-30s are just as modern--the 15 is a bloody old aircraft.
              SG shouldnt have bought it.</p>

              <p>It's hardly old, the innards of the plane are about as cutting-edge an Eagle you can get.</p>
              <p>Unless you are a radically new design like the F-22 or some 5th Gen fighter, any airframe Gen 4.5 or what is going to be somewhat long in the tooth, even the Su-30 is based on a older airframe.</p>
              <p>No need to get yourself in a twist over it... might be an issue in a knifefight but BVR your radar and avionics and missiles are going to be more of a factor then how many gees you can pull.</p>
