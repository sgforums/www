            <div class='col-md body'>DANA R. DILLON quoted Tim Huxley as follows in his "Contemporary Security Challenges in Southeast Asia" published in the Spring 1997 issue of Parameters.<br><br><a href="http://www.carlisle.army.mil/usawc/Parameters/97spring/dillon.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.carlisle.army.mil/usawc/Parameters/97spring/dillon.htm</a><br><br>"In insular Southeast Asia the principal source of friction is the historical animosity between Malaysia and Singapore. Singapore has been portrayed as "a Chinese nut in a Malay nutcracker,"[34] but this metaphor belies the actual situation. The Singapore Armed Forces (SAF) are specifically designed, equipped, and trained to conduct military operations on the Malay peninsula. Should widespread internal instability in Indonesia or Malaysia result in violence against ethnic Chinese, threaten Singapore directly or indirectly, or threaten the island state's extensive economic investment in those countries, the SAF is clearly capable of protecting Singapore's interests however it chooses to define them.[35] A Singaporean invasion of any ASEAN country would most likely result in the complete collapse of ASEAN. In fact, the possible repercussions are so devastating that <span style="color: red;">one observer has called Singapore's strategy "a sort of regional 'doomsday machine.'"[36]</span><br><br>34. Tim Huxley, "Singapore and Malaysia: A Precarious Balance," Pacific Review, 4 (No. 3, 1991), p. 210.<br>35. Dillon, p. 58.<br><span style="color: red;">36. Huxley, Pacific Review, p. 210.</span>"<br><br>Does anybody have the original text where Tim Huxley called Singapore's strategy a sort of regional doomsday machine?<br><br>Cheers,<br>Sunho</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>The rotation of the top military officiers have its uses. This is to allow them to gain experience in as much field as possible so that when war starts should one dies there is another one who can take over. The chances of SPF and SCDF officiers dying in war is significantly lower due to them being civilians and are non-combatants<br><br>But personally i think those officiers can't stay for long is due to the fear of an attempted military coup to take over the government. This have happened before in many ASEAN countries such as neighbouring Indonesia and many times in Philippines. When an officier stays at a top post for too long he will consolidate power and corruption may occur.<br><br>Of course one may argue that this is very unlikely in present day Singapore but this is a very real problem back in the early days of nationhood. So i guess the changing of top military brass to facilitate their entry into politics is one way of preventing a coup back then. Some how this is carried till now due to the merits of this system as these ex-officiers are very good candidates for senior government posts.

This is to allow them to gain experience in as much field as possible so that when war starts should one dies there is another one who can take over. The chances of SPF and SCDF officiers dying in war is significantly lower due to them being civilians and are non-combatants  [/quote]<br><br>Wow. I'm going to jump your throat right now. That's a very dumb statement. Top military officers are rarely neutralised during war. There's no need to stockpile on them.<br><br>I think COAs and CDFs are as non-combatant as the PM. Unless you can illustrate otherwise.<br><br><blockquote><strong>But personally i think those officiers can't stay for long is due to the fear of an attempted military coup to take over the government. This have happened before in many ASEAN countries such as neighbouring Indonesia and many times in Philippines. When an officier stays at a top post for too long he will consolidate power and corruption may occur. </strong></blockquote></div></blockquote><strong>Wow. Another one. The SAF is as de-politicised as you can get. The only time when it marrs this image is when the CDFs and COAs cross over to become politicians.<br><br>And you seem to suggest that the strain of military coup is especially present in ASEAN countries. Is that an argument even?<br><br><strong>[quote]Of course one may argue that this is very unlikely in present day Singapore but this is a very real problem back in the early days of nationhood. So i guess the changing of top military brass to facilitate their entry into politics is one way of preventing a coup back then. Some how this is carried till now due to the merits of this system as these ex-officiers are very good candidates for senior government posts.
