              <p>yeap.</p>
              <p>but point being is that the firm future direction is there. IIRC, no one in nato is looking at a future heavy armoured force. COTS yes, tracked armoured vehicle, very unlikely.</p>
              <p>besides, they have to produce something out of FRES to justify the money budgeted and spent on it. and money is tight with campaigns in afghanistan and the new queen elizabeth class carriers in the pipeline.</p>

              <p>dont quite agree.</p>
              <p>in the sense, yes, its signficant as its the first time Britain has bought a weapons platform for us (instead of the other way round)</p>
              <p>but relative significance, in terms of overall sales and plans/position in british army procurement programs, current and future? a tiny drop in the ocean perhaps ?</p>
              <p>bottomline :selling to the royal marines is something. getting and fighting for the chance to be chosen as the key mainstay component of FRES, the rapid wheeled vehicle, is non-existent given the fact that the bionix dosent meet the requirements, nor was it shortlisted/ considered.</p>
              <p>if the situation were somewhat different, say if the UK was looking for a tracked 1-1 replacement for its warrior IFVs and the light tanks of the household calvary, maybe the bionix would stand a chance. but with FRES, its clear that the UK is moving away from that direction, and more towards a wheeled IFV/striker CBT/c130-airlift capable concept.</p>
              <p>kinda like CNY, everybody buy orange to give to each other then someone goes and buy a grapefruit and tries to substitute it for a prange. totally out of future plans context. USMC and britain both buy MRAPs for service in Iraq and afghanistan, are MRAPS going to become the standard mounted vehicle for future combat situations ? unlikely. its there to meet a specific need.</p>
              <p>40mm grenades, STK happen to be the world's largest manufacturer of it. maybe more of a case of pragmatic economics ? go for the lowest cost bidder ? the queen E class carriers are expensive. so are the typhoons and the operational costs of the afghan units.</p>
