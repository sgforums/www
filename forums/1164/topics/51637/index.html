            <div class='col-md body'>Perhaps they can ask the ROCaf if they are interested. But i don't think the indonesians will get much for the A/Bs. The US is already flooding the market with their surplus A/B stocks.<br><br>The skyhawks...lagi tidak bisa...already 3rd hand. (Hand me downs from the israeli air force who got them 2nd hand). Perhaps they can trade in with the Argentinians for their Pucara COIN aircraft..pretty useful in low-intensity conflicts<br><br>Looks like its russian redux for the indon air force again...itz yesterday once more<br><br></div>
