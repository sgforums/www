The 51mm and 39mm refers to the case length of the round.   Even if it were possible to chamber the round, the bolt will not close.   The case of the Russian ammo is tapered while that of the Nato is parallel.   Furthermore, the chamber pressure for the Nato round is so much higher than that of the Russian one.<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by Tango1:<br></div><div class="quote_body">its all part of how the soviets build their weapons....typically tailored towards utilizing captured NATO ammo stocks if there was ever a WWIII. so even their MIGs and SUs have nozzle adaptors that can accept NATO-sized fuel nozzles should they overrun NATO airbases. Another example is the 82mm mortar that can fire U.S. 81mm rounds, but not the other way around.....widely done during the Vietnam war.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"> </div></blockquote>It _might_ be possible to fire a captured 81mm mortar <strong>bomb</strong> (NOT round as you stated - I should know - I was from the artillery) in an 82mm mortar.   But that is because of the architecture of mortars and mortar bombs.<br><br>From what you had said, one may infer that it is possible to fire a 100mm tank round from a 105mm gun, but one would be wrong!</div>
