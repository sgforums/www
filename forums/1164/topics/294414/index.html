Plenty of natural resources... the only sad thing is that, they do not love it and they do not treasure it<br><br>with proper management and care, Indonesia can be set to compete with nations like china Japan USA...<br><br>but they are lacking in foresight and they apparently are not managing themselves well.. one day.. it will be at their loss... where they start to wake up...<br><br>by then too late.</div>

He's released from jail after only a 26-month sentence. The same court gave the Christian Sunday school teacher on the right three years for teaching others to turn the other cheek.<br><br>Welcome to Indonesia...... I spit on the unfairness and those highly paid Ministers , Generals, and mentors in Singapore who continue to carry the Indonesian oversized balls......</strong></blockquote>I agree with you completely.<br><br>But unfortunately, the reality is that a place like Indonesia will never be well-governed, If tthe government of today falls, the next government will be equally ruthless - be they Islamic, Javanese or Acehnese etc.<br><br>It is funny as most of these SE Asian peoples had empires going back more than a thousand years like the Cambodians, Javanese, Siam etc yet today, they are still medieval in many ways.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>What I am trying to say is that, with Indonesia at least, maybe our government is right in supporting them. (Though this is contrary to what I said earlier.)<br><br>The current Indo government is still relatively " moderate " and enjoys a certain amount of popular support. If they fall by violent means, the next government that rises in its place will definitely be worst.<br><br>But Burma is a different case.</div>
