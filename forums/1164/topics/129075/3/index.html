            <div class='col-md body'>the M-79 and other grenade launchers are not grenade launchers as such - they are self contained gas capsules with the bb's loaded into tubes.<br>on activation of the gas system, these balls are sent out in one go [and often with an impressive gas cloud display] - numbers [25, 165, etc] vary depending on the capsule used, but they are not very powerful and are more for display or close-quarters useage.<br><br>the squad machine guns - the M249 / minimi and the M60 variants [i own a M60e3 shorty myself] operate on a different system to the standard 'electric gear/motor' system used in mainstream airsoft guns.<br>in stea dof the gears and air piston, these use a bellows system, which although allows a high rate of fire, means that they fail quite often.<br><br>alot of people take the route of replacing the internals with the mainstream electric gears and motor system [of say, an AK or a M16 variant].<br><br>CO2 is the old system of airsoft guns, originating in japan, but they were banned from the field after players kept fiddling with the regulators and raising their velocity dangerously.<br>Tokyo Marui, with their experience in remote control cars, motors and gears, built up the AEG range of airsoft guns, and due to their cheapness to both buy and run, and the fact that they were not as easily modified in terms of power as the CO2 guns were, meant that they basically grabbed the airsoft market very quickly, and most of the gas airsoft companies disappeared overnight, hence the rarity of CO2 powered guns.<br><br>in the west, CO2 powered air rifles and pistols are very popular, but cannot be legally use for 'gaming' as they are rated as too powerful.<br>airsoft, however, is rated as safe, and sufficiently low powered enough to be recognised as just a toy in some areas.<br><br>this does lead to the oft-heard confusion of pellets, CO2-powered guns, etc.<br><br>airsoft uses bb's.<br><br>air rifles and pistol suses pellets, and often lead ones.<br><br>airsoft can use co2, but often its hfc134 [freons replacement in refrigerators], 'green gas' [similar to propane?], but the most common form of power is derived from electric motors, of the type found in r/c cars.<br><br>typical range for airsoft is about 30-40m with any kind of 'hopeful' accuracy.<br>you can lob further but..well.. thats just not sporting..<br><br>stock power of airsoft is 0.80 Joules.<br>equates to about 280fps.<br><br>the 1j playing limit advocated in most fields abroad is 328fps [for all types of guns - smg, rifle, sniper, bolt-action]<br><br>air pistol fps might typically be 480fps.<br>air rifles are often 600fps and above.<br><br>so you can see the massive differences between airsoft and air weapons, and its a very important and fundamental difference.<br>authorities often get mixed up and think its airsoft that shoots at air rifle and pistol powers when they obviously are not.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>The reason why we modify our guns is because it is an "arms race" situation. Everybody's weapon is modified for increased strength. You want to hurt them as much as they are going to hurt you.<br><br>There is an honour system of shouting "die" when you get hit and then leave the game. But you cannot find honour among such gatherings so it's got to be so painful they would give up.<br><br>Also, the excitement increases with the pain level. Otherwise we'll be playing paintball. How fast your heart beats, how fast you run when taking cover also depends on how painful being hit is.<br><br>Furthermore, after modification, your weapon can reach out to 50m. Without modification, maybe 30m.<br><br>Modification usually involves changing the motor to a more powerful one, changing the recoil spring, upping the battery power. Finally, you have to replace some of the gear wheels with tougher ones so they can take the increased strain.</div>
