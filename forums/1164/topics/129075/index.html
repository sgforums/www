            <div class='col-md body'>once airsoft is legal there will surely be jokers taking them on the streets and shooting ppl. with lead pellets there WILL be skin penetration. with chewing gun you are talking about stalled lifts and MRT. what more the potential for injury?<br><br>after all at the moment half the fun of owning an airsoft is the very possession of it, because well its illegal. i have played with the airsofts owned by friends (all in sg) and it was harmless fun we shot at birds and cats harassing his pets. we once formed a firing squad and shot at a watermelon in his living room, after i had been inspired by a pic of a real desert eagle disintegrating a watermelon. even at pointblank range the plastic pellets would not fully penetrate the watermelon skin. however i imagine lead pellets would be much more lethal<br><br>i used to be on the school air pistol team and once i sneaked an apple into the range and shot at it (this with a full-spec feinwerkbau competition air pistol with lead pellets) and the shot went clean through. like the one with potatoes i think it would have gone through many apples. such guns are truly dangerous weapons!<br><br>i'm for the status quo.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>well ban lead pellets then, make sure they're not suitable for use in airsoft models, and impose a fine or law that might be something like exposure of a replica model of guns and they can only be used in ranges lah, s'pore like not open minded leh... and of course, everything comes with a risk, it's only how you handle it...<br></div>
