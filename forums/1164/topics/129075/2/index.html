Rubber ones should be all right. But it is still better to use Airsoft products for military or police training, IMO.

You would really understand what is true cover and what isn't.<br><br>Once we were playing this game called "sniper". There's only ten of us, 2 SAF-trained Singaporeans including myself and 8 HK seasoned wargamers. We took turns to be the pair of "snipers" while the other 8 hunt the snipers.<br><br>This particular instance, the other SAF guy and a HKer were snipers and they managed to kill off the other 7 men in my team. They didn't listen to my advice and didn't do fire movement, preferring to creep around the bushes. They got picked off one by one.<br><br>Instead of hunting, I became hunted as the odds now not in my favour with me against 2 of them.<br><br>I took cover behind a bush and this HK guy kept shredding the branches above my head with pellets from my left. I had to keep my head down. I was flat on the ground on returning fire every now and then.<br><br>Suddenly the other SAF guy appeared and rushed me from the right and I saw him just in time.

Anyway, did you put it inside your hand luggage? Sharp items should be checked in.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>nay. a lot of negative events could happen with the introduction of such toys in singapore. but of course even casino get the go ahead with appropriate social safety net in place... why not? maybe we can tax airsoft ten time more heavily than liquor or a placement of a million dollar deposit.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_twisted.gif" alt="Twisted Evil" title="Twisted Evil"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>It was a real khukri, but it wasn't a high grade one like those the ghurka contingent use. The blade wasn't stainless steel and instead was some soft metal.<br><br>Anyway, back to airsoft.<br><br>I know a few friends whom have managed somehow to smuggle these toys back to SG. One has a battery-operated MP-5 with retracting stock, a few had CO2 pistols, and one brought back a CO2 MAC-10 - very rare. I won't telll you how they did it so you'd have to use your imagination.<br><br>In HK, you can still buy these items. I saw a M-60 GPMG even! Also M-79 grenade launchers and M-203. How these work I don't know.<br><br>Shotguns and revolvers are especially problematic. The shots are very weak as too much gas escapes. And the revolving mechanism of the revolvers break down very quickly.<br><br>You can stop dreaming about them becoming legal in Singapore as they look too realistic. If you are seen with one you can expect to get shot by the police.<br><br>And they can very very dangerous espcially after modifications. I had a CO2 92F pistol that could shatter a glass jar from a distance of 10m. All metal construction, heavy as hell, and Zoik - it was Japanese - albeit a very old model I bought second-hand from a friend. It was one of those whose slide action doesn't move when you fire. Less realistic but all the power is directed to propelling the pellet instead of moving the slide.<br><br>HK is a funny place. The laws concerning airsoft aren't very rigid or clear. But HK is a place of "unwritten" laws - grey areas. You can buy them, shops can sell them, and there are certain "designated" places where you can play with them where the police wouldn't freak out. But generally, you are supposed to keep them covered in public.</div>
