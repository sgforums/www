This is due to Nepal being sandwiched between these two huge countries. And the Gurkhas are those which look more like Chinese with a good tan.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"></div>

So I assume its part of the police "field" uniform.</div>

These were also unarmed but no SBO.<br><br>Their instructor was also a gurkha in his mid-20's - very co.cky and was trying to look intimidating.<br><br>The embarrassing thing was that on this hike I also met some SAF NSFs trainig with full combat gear.
