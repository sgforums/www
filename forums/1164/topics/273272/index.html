            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by y33bas:</div><div class="quote_body">After 72 hours after Singapore successfully invaded the johor state of malaysia, a cease fire is sought by the UN Security Council. The border will be sealed up to prevent any in or out flow of civilians. What is Singapore going to do with the new found hinter-land? A new found hinterland would pose new problems to the SAF. Will that area be transferred to the administration of the Singapore Government? What is SIngapore going to do to cope with the new social, economic problems if it acquired johor?</div></blockquote>Its very unlikely that Singapore will get to keep Johore assuming such a scenario really did happen. I am also assuming that the Malaysians attacked us first and that we invaded Johore out of self-defence by counter attacking.<br><br>Firstly, our SAF is made up of mainly NSF and NSmen, to sucessfully assimilate Johore into our Singapore territory will take many years of occupation much like what is happening in Afganistan and Iraq. With these non regular soldiers stationed long term in Johore who will work and support Singapore's economy? These men made up a very significant part of Singapore's workforce.<br><br>Secondly, occupation after the main hostilities end is lots of work, in fact much more troublesome than the actual invasion itself. Again as shown in Iraq and Afganistan. Lots of manpower and money have to be spent. This is on top of a heavily damged economy due to lack of the peace-time workforce, foreign investments pulling out and much reduced maritime and overland  trade.<br><br>Thirdly, as Malaysia is a member of the UN and that their capital and government is still intact. They will definitely go to the UN for help to reclaim back their lost lands. The rest of the muslim nations will definitely support them and threaten us with jihad should we not comply.<br><br>So it is very unlikely we get to keep Johore but with the help of our international allies such as USA, we will get somthing in return. For example we will eventually return Johore back to Malaysian government administration but they will have to ensure a demilitarised zone in the state of Johore where no military or paramilitary forces are to be stationed there. This will include army camps, air and naval bases. This is with the exception of the Malaysian police which is to maintain peace and order.<br><br>Our RSAF will have official and undeniable authority to over-fly Malaysian airspace to enter the South China Sea training area. Our RSAF is to conduct joint patrols with the RMAF over Johore. Our RSN will also be able to sail into Malaysian territorial waters to conduct joint patrols in Johore waters with their police coast guards.<br><br>Malaysia is to give up the claim over Pedra Branca and recognise Singapore's sovereignty over the current disputed island. The issue of water supply to Singapore should comply strictly to the earlier signed agreements and that there should not be any doubts to be expressed by the Malaysian politicians in the future especially during elections time. The Singapore government will gain control over the Malaysian railway(KTM) lands in Singapore as compensation for their aggression. The KTM can still run the railway but the land which their Tanjong Pagar railways station and tracks sit on now belongs to the Singapre government.<br><br>They may also need to pay a fixed sum of war reparations by instalments either in money or in natural resources which Malaysia have plenty due to the fact that they are the aggressors who fired the first shot.<br><br>At the same time the Singapoe government will keep the Johore Sultan in place and give him due respect as before such as visiting him during Hari Raya, this move is to demonstrate our good will and our peaceful intentions. And also because the Malaysian Royalty still wield great influence and power in the Malaysian government. Johore is one of the biggest states in Peninsular Malaysia.<br><br>Singaporeans in Johore may have certain concessions such as our business and property owners in Johore will have fair and equal chances and opportunities to contracts, rights and services respectively as compared to the Bumiputras. Singaporeans in Johore are not to be subjected the paying corrupt officials such as policemen and custom officiers which is currently the norm.<br><br>I believe a fair and reasonable solution is the key to securing future peace in our region.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>yeah..i believe that is the most appropriate thing that the Singapore government will do after acquiring Malaysia as replied by tankee1981. Without taking care of the administration of johor but yet taking the upper hand of overlooking the country of Malaysia. It is much more easier to settle for a one time solution rather than taking it into their own hands of running part of johor themselves. HOWEVER, do you remember that Singapore actually was part of Malaysia before? Would some politician suddenly think that keeping Malaysia is actually better in the long run since it will benefit Singapore in the long run because the availability to resources like food and water? Even if we were to return johor Malaysia, i think the government will actually be very scared that another scenario will happen again.<br><br>Then..what would happen if Singapore conducted a poll by the residents of johor to decide to stay with Singapore or Malaysia? Like a repeat of the 1965 formation of Malaysia through referendum? Would UN council recognize such a vote by the residents of Malaysia if most voted to stay with Singapore?</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Those of you who are privy to these scenarios would already know. So, this is my personal opinion yeah <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"> Just to set the record straight..<br><br>Even if Singapore does not fully mobilize her 320,000 conscript reservists, she has 75, 300 active troops currently. That is more than anything the Malaysians can marshall in such a short time. The Malaysians do expect us to come in and lose territory. There is no way they can keep the equivalent of a defensive line to prevent Singapore from entering Johor. They do want to keep a buffer of sorts as fighting headlong in Johor would mean the end of the MAF as we know it. Thier`s will be a war of attrition and will. Incidentally, our`s will be the same too once we have Johor. But they understand that thier economy will completely be in pieces once we come in and gain control of the air.<br><br>That said, this would most likely end in a cease-fire. However, the SAF is prepared to occupy Johor for as long as it takes. Troop rotation is the key. Similar to the Israeli occupation to the West bank, Golan and Gaza. There will be casualties but if that is the lesser of two evils, then it has to be done. And honestly, Mindef has thier homework. Our key industries will not be emptied of a workforce. One key thing to note is that the proportion of our reservist forces have not risen in spite of the rise of population; at about 300,000. That is not an incident. It is intentional.<br><br>War is one thing and occupation is another thing. You do not need as many troops for `occupation.'  And Malaysia is not Vietnam or Iraq. In fact, you will find the population quite docile. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"> Add that to the simmering race problems inherent in the country and you will certainly get certain segments of the population who would rather join us.<br><br>The muslim world is weak and divided. They work only for thier own interests. Look at the Middle East. And Indonesia is not exactly good buddies with Malaysia; especially if Malaysia starts the conflicts with an eye to take Singapore.<br><br>Lastly, the world will not sit idly. 80%-90% of East Asia`s oil flows through Singapore. And Im not even talking about trade; especially to the US`s western sea-board. The majority of these nations are Singapore`s allies and strong friends.<br><br>The end of the conflict would see Singapore`s strategic hold becoming stronger with the expected series of concessions made; some of which have already been related by Tankee.<br><br>The Malaysians know that there is little they can do to coerce Singapore to do anything. Hence, they are reduced to making loud farts from across the causeway which incidentally do more harm to themselves than anything. Look at the tin-pot monkey, Mat-hatter. At the very end, the world sees him as an senile and totally without leverage.<br><br>However, the biggest drawback in my opinion ( and a relatively new phenomenom) to a Singaporean invasion is the advent of muslim fundementalists who will make this thier war as well.  We will have to watch our `sixth' more than ever before.<br><br></div>

Only wannabe terrorists. But control has been quite effective though there has been lapses in Indonesia.<br><br>At any rate, Singapore will only go to war if war is forced upon us. That means we have little choice. These ancillary issues(if they turn out to be the case.
