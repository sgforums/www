The border will be sealed up to prevent any in or out flow of civilians. What is Singapore going to do with the new found hinter-land? A new found hinterland would pose new problems to the SAF. Will that area be transferred to the administration of the Singapore Government? What is SIngapore going to do to cope with the new social, economic problems if it acquired johor?</div></blockquote>Boy,malaysia can still last more than 72 hours unlike singapore because they have overseas territories like the massive sabah, sarawak and numerous islands bigger than singapore.My point is they can easily relocate their command post anywhere, making it hard for rsaf to bomb.Singapore move to pulau ubin?? Communication break down,we lose.... don't count on the container lan room to direct the army.......</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>no matter what in a war the racial element will be a key advantage in theory to the war planners in singapore. but who knows what will actually happen until you're there?  as for sabah, sarawak..i think they are too far away to deploy reinforcements.
