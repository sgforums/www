So, there would already have been losses as a result of Singapore`s coordinated assaults from land and air. It is also obvious that our military plans would already accomodate the issue about guerillas. It is only to be expected if you are occupying territory. The ones we can see, we would bomb, shoot missiles/rockets, saturate with artillery, etc. We would have to vigilant for those who cannot see. Of course, we can also infiltrate into the local population as well to know more by then. Like I said, race relations in Malaysia is on a knife`s edge. There will be some who welcome us definitely.<br><br>Im not being optimistic. More of a realist where this scenario is concerned.</div>

We would not simply declare war;war is thursted upon us. This scenario is predicated on that assumption.That means we would have no choice but to force the issue.

War would be the only viable option available by then. Especially, if negotiations, protracted or not, fails.

Incidentally, a lot of decisions which are in our favour is swayed by this fact.<br><br><blockquote><br>The "logic" with UN punitive would start with Economic Sanction together with the threat of force. We saw collective security come into play during the liberation of Kuwait, but that is when all the Gold has been taken and oil field has been burn.<br></blockquote>Do not be fooled. The UN is a tool of great powers and the `rich and famous'. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"> If you manipulate them right and are good buddies with the powers that be, you will get a better reception. Which is what diplomacy is for anyway. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Albar is the Malaysian PM`s poodle. Remember how he was like during Mat-hatter`s reign? He has sinced toned down his rhetoric under a more rational and sane PM in Badawi.  During the height of the Indo-Malaysian crisis, he was quoted as saying that god himself would intervene if both latter countries confront one another.<br><br>The SAF is indeed an insurance policy. But it`s much more than that. The SAF gives power and leverage to our diplomactic influence and drives. That power and leverage is a sub-set of how much powerful the SAF is at a given point of time.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Like what the others had said, yes SAF might have be able to mob 75,000+ soldiers and RSAF 4-1 ratio but thinking of of we do a lighting strike all the way to the capital,isn't is costly to do so??? We are going to suffer serious losses and lose land too. It might be cheaper to juz hold on to johore and dig in to defence ourselves...</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>IMHO..... we will take the whole of JB in under 1 weeks.... then ask for cease fire under the UN....Willingly return 3/4 of JB back to Malaysia if they will agree to a peace talk..... then we hold on to the 1/4 of JB under the excuse of using it as a DMZ.<br><br>More or less what the Korea are doing..... very uneasy peace. We will always be under the threat of terrorist attack. Therefore not really worth the effect unless Malaysia attack us 1st.</div>
