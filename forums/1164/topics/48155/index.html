the second on Iraq - was widely criticised when it emerged part of it was copied from a 12-year-old thesis by an American student.<br><br>The first document to make the case for war, published last September, is being investigated by MPs.<br><br>Downing Street has denied Mr Campbell's intervention amounts to an apology.<br><br>The prime minister is under increasing pressure over the way the government made the case for war in Iraq, with coalition forces yet to find weapons of mass destruction.<br><br>The Conservatives have repeatedly called for an independent inquiry into whether intelligence documents were changed on the orders of Downing Street to strengthen the case for military action.<br><br>Meanwhile, intelligence officers are holding a "smoking gun" showing they came under pressure for evidence to use against Iraq in the run-up to the conflict, it is reported.<br><br>The Independent on Sunday says intelligence services were so concerned about demands made by Downing Street they kept detailed records of communications with the prime minister's staff.<br><br>The Sunday Telegraph reported Mr Campbell wrote a personal letter to Sir Richard Dearlove, chief of the Secret Intelligence Service (MI6).<br><br>The paper claims senior intelligence officers were furious the document had been made up of their own information combined with other sources.<br><br>'Excellent terms'<br><br>In response to the paper's story, a Downing Street spokesman said: "Like many other stories on weapons of mass destruction, this one is totally overblown.<br><br>"What happened in the wake of the controversy surrounding the second dossier was that Alastair Campbell spoke to those who had been responsible for its production to demand tighter procedures.<br><br>"He also assured the (intelligence) agencies that far greater care would be taken in dealing with anything that might impact on their reputation or their work."<br><br>The spokesman added: "Alastair is on excellent terms with the head of the Secret Intelligence Service."<br><br>Downing Street said it would not characterise it as a "letter of apology".<br><br>But a Conservative Party spokesman said: "We don't need an apology from Alastair Campbell - what we need is an independent inquiry into what was going on in Number 10 over the presentation of intelligence reports."<br><br>And Tory leader Iain Duncan Smith told BBC One's Breakfast with Frost programme: "The government's credibility, the prime minister's credibility is on the line because nobody believes what he says anymore.<br><br>"The only way to clear that up, and to make sure that our troops and our intelligence services are trusted in the next few years during the reconstruction, is to have an independent inquiry."<br><br>'Honest appraisal'<br><br>Chancellor Gordon Brown insisted that "the evidence and history will prove that Tony Blair made a courageous and the right decision over Iraq".<br><br>"I believe that all countries, when we passed the UN resolution... believed that there were and are weapons of mass destruction," he told the programme.<br><br>Home Secretary David Blunkett said: "I think it would have been better if we hadn't published that dossier because it was about the background to Iraq - it wasn't about the identification of WMD."<br><br>The letter had been "an honest appraisal" by Mr Campbell, but a line should be drawn under the issue, he told BBC's The Politics Show.<br><br>'Not doctored'<br><br>The second dossier, entitled Iraq: Its Infrastructure of Concealment, Deception and Intimidation, was distributed to journalists on Mr Blair's trip to Washington to discuss plans for war.<br><br>There was a furore when it was revealed parts were lifted from a thesis on the internet.<br><br>The Sunday Telegraph claims it was not first cleared by the Joint Intelligence Committee before being published.<br><br>That committee approved the first dossier, published in September, which is now subject to an inquiry by the Commons foreign affairs select committee.<br><br>The Intelligence and Security Committee is also investigating that report, which the government denies was doctored in order to muster support for war.<br><br>A key point of contention in the first dossier was the claim that Iraq could launch a chemical attack in 45 minutes.<br><br>Downing Street is standing by the intelligence provided in that report.<br></div>

A little history might provide perspective. Since 1991, United Nations weapons inspectors have found and destroyed weapons in Iraq that include a supergun, 48 Scud missiles, 500,000 litres of chemical-weapons agents, 1.8 million litres of precursor chemicals, and large quantities of equipment related to biological warfare.<br><br>Still, inspectors were sure large quantities of weapons were missing. In July 1998, for example, UN inspectors found a document showing that Iraq had deliberately overstated - by 6,000 - the number of chemical bombs it had used in the Iran-Iraq War. The 6,000 chemical bombs are still missing.<br><br>But it is also clear that the United States government overstated the threat posed by Iraq. It exaggerated what it knew and made definitive statements where the intelligence was murky. Mr Richard Butler, the UN's chief weapons inspector during the late 1990s and a supporter of the war, wrote last week in The Australian: 'Clearly, a decision had been taken to pump up the case against Iraq.'<br><br>This should not surprise us. For decades, some conservatives, including many who now wield great influence, have had a tendency to vastly exaggerate the threat posed by tyrannical regimes. It all started with the now famous 'Team B' exercise.<br><br>During the early 1970s, hard-line conservatives pilloried the Central Intelligence Agency for being soft on the Soviets. As a result, CIA director George Bush agreed to allow a team of external experts to look at the intelligence and come to their own conclusions. Team B - which included current Deputy Defence Secretary Paul Wolfowitz - produced a scathing report, claiming that the Soviet threat had been badly underestimated.<br><br>In retrospect, Team B's conclusions were wildly off the mark. Describing the Soviet Union, in 1976, as having 'a large and expanding gross national product', it predicted that it would modernise and expand its military at an awesome pace. For example, it predicted that the Backfire bomber 'probably will be produced in substantial numbers, with perhaps 500 aircraft off the line by early 1984'. In fact, the Soviets had 235 of such aircraft in 1984.<br><br>The reality was that even the CIA's own estimates - savaged as too low by Team B - were, in retrospect, gross exaggerations. In 1989, the CIA published an internal review of its threat assessments from 1974 to 1986 and concluded that, every year, it had 'substantially overestimated' the Soviet threat along all dimensions. For example, in 1975, the CIA forecast that within 10 years, the Soviet Union would replace 90 per cent of its long-range bombers and missiles. In fact, by 1985, the Soviet Union had replaced less than 60 per cent of them.<br><br>In the 1990s, some of these same conservatives decided that China was the new enemy. The only problem was that China was still a Third World country and could hardly be seen as a grave threat to the United States. What followed was wild speculation about the size of the Chinese military and accusations that it had engaged in massive theft of American nuclear secrets. This came to a crescendo with the publication of the Cox Commission Report in 1999, which claimed that Chinese military spending was twice what the CIA estimated.<br><br>The Cox report is replete with speculation, loose assumptions and errors of fact.<br><br>The book it cites in its footnotes for its military-spending numbers, for example, does not say what the report claims.<br><br>Iraq is part of a pattern. In each of these cases, arguments about the threat posed by a country rest in large part on the character of the regime. The Team B report explains that the CIA's analysis was flawed because it was based on too much 'hard data' - meaning facts - and neglected to divine Soviet intentions. The Chinese regime is assumed to be a mortal danger because it is Leninist. Saddam Hussein was assumed to be working on a vast weapons programme because he was an evil man.<br><br>Let's never forget that these regimes are nasty, and that does matter greatly. But threat assessment must be based not simply on the intentions of an adversary, but on his capabilities as well. This is an important lesson as we move forward to deal with repressive regimes like those in North Korea, Iran, Libya and Syria. They are evil and may need to be confronted. But let us do so with a clear and accurate picture of the threat they pose, not some figment of our fevered imaginations.<br><br>What we discovered about the Soviet Union after the Cold War was that it was every bit as evil as we had thought - indeed more so - but that it was a whole lot less powerful than we had feared. That is what we will probably discover about Saddam's Iraq.<br><br></div>

But for Iraqis, depending on handouts, even after 12 years of sanctions, is anything but normal.<br>The refrigerator was completely empty.<br><br>Not partially empty, with a few leftover eggs, a small block of sweating cheese, maybe a few soft tomatoes.<br><br>It was barren. All four shelves dark, cavernous and empty.<br><br>My host, Sanaa, looked embarrassed. "It shouldn't be this way," she said. "I'm educated. I'm a trained engineer. Still, we have no food."<br><br>A mother-of-four, Sanaa was a petite woman with large eyes and a stomach that curved inwards. She cut a forlorn figure in the darkened kitchen.<br><br>It was a sweltering Baghdad afternoon. But this middle-class neighbourhood, like the rest of the city, was suffering yet another electricity blackout.<br><br>Dressed entirely in black - black trousers, black blouse and headscarf - Sanaa said she was in mourning. Not for the destruction wrought upon her country. Her grief was far more personal.<br><br>"My father died a few weeks ago, during the war, as the bombs were falling on Baghdad," she said.<br><br>"He was old, yes, but he died from weakness. The sanctions and the wars killed him before his time."<br><br>But even in her distress, Sanaa was acutely aware of her duties as a hostess.<br><br>"I would offer you some coffee and biscuits," she said, looking around at the empty shelves. "But..." She trailed off, spreading her hands in a gesture of defeat.<br><br>Picnics and garden parties<br><br>Years ago, before sanctions, before Iraq's successive wars, the biggest health problem amongst Iraqi children was obesity. Hunger was never deeply felt.<br><br>Summer was a time of picnics and garden parties laid out with long skewers of grilled kebabs and platters of rice and lamb so large and heavy, it took two grown men to carry them.<br><br>Food was once at the heart of Iraq's culture of hospitality. Today, Iraqis are lucky if their potatoes last through the week.<br><br>Not that potatoes are even part of the government's ration programme.<br><br>Sanaa showed me the sheet of postage-stamp-sized coupons every Iraqi family uses to claim its monthly rations.<br><br>"We get sugar, a sack of flour, rice, cooking oil, soap, detergent, milk, lentils and beans," she explained.<br><br>"But no meat or bread or vegetables. It's very difficult. We can afford meat maybe once a week. But mostly, it's rice and potatoes. Rice I have left over from rations before the war. And potatoes - they're filling and they don't rot easily."<br><br>The resumption of rations means Iraqi families will have the basics once again. But it's hardly the same as eating well, feeling full and happy and able to cope with daily life.<br><br>So many Iraqis complained to me of their children going to school hungry; of their daily struggle in the summer heat, feeling weak and tired; of the sick dying for lack of proper food and clean water.<br><br>All this in a country potentially rich enough to feed itself and others.<br><br>Dose of humiliation<br><br>Today, even the wealthiest Iraqis are struggling.<br><br>The lucky ones employed in essential services, like electricity boards, schools and hospitals occasionally receive $20 handouts and a dose of humiliation.<br><br>They're lined up by their new paymasters and photographed by the world's media - all to prove that Iraq is returning to normalcy.<br><br>And what can you buy for $20? In the market, a scrawny chicken costs $2. A kilo of lamb $3. Vegetables are considered poor value for money since they rot so quickly in the heat.<br><br>And petrol - bubbling from the ground in Iraq, but suddenly as scarce as Saddam Hussein. Rather than queuing day and night for petrol many people have simply abandoned their cars. A taxi ride to and from work costs $4. Multiply that by five days, and your $20 salary may well have never existed.<br><br>Sanaa tells me of a relative who was first forced to sell all her jewellery, the pride of any Iraqi woman. Then the family's furniture: the couches, beds, wardrobes, chairs and tables, and finally, the rugs, even the books, to pay for her husband's cancer treatment.<br><br>He died, leaving the family alone and destitute.<br><br>"The Iraqis," she says, tears of frustration filling her dark brown eyes, "our spirit has been broken.<br><br>"The Americans promised us freedom. George Bush said he would liberate us. I want more than liberation. I want to buy my own food in the market. I want a decent job, a salary.<br><br>"I don't want to keep a gun in my house to shoot thieves and looters. My children want chocolate and biscuits. Why should we trust the Americans? They are hiding in the Ministry of Oil. They have no idea what our life is like."<br><br>Generosity<br><br>It was difficult not to feel Sanaa's frustration. I imagined my own life in London interrupted by armed gangs, and the lack of food and electricity.<br><br>Yet none of the Iraqis I met expressed even a trace of hatred or contempt for the West or for Westerners like me.<br><br>Despite the misery induced by a Western-led war, they were deeply friendly and hospitable.<br><br>If there is a measure of hope for Iraq, it lies in the generosity and skill of people like Sanaa. The doctors, teachers, engineers and technicians who have volunteered to keep Baghdad's limited services running.<br><br>As I left her empty kitchen, Sanaa gave me a motherly hug.<br><br>"Next time you come," she said. "Insha'allah, we will have more to offer you."<br><br></div>

And he insisted that any allegation that the intelligence was politicised was false.<br><br>The defence secretary said he was hopeful about getting a sizeable set of foreign forces in Iraq to help with peacekeeping, with the first ones likely to arrive in September.<br><br>The US was in various types of discussions with 41 countries, he said.<br><br>Mr Rumsfeld is on the first leg of a tour of Europe, which is still smarting from its divisions over Iraq.<br><br>He will be thanking Portugal and Albania for their support before travelling to Germany, an opponent of US policy.<br><br>He will then head to Belgium for the Nato meeting, to discuss changes to forces and command structures in the alliance.<br><br>The meeting comes at a time when the US is studying significant changes to its presence in Europe as part of a worldwide military reorganisation - perhaps scaling back traditional bases in Germany and using more facilities in former Soviet bloc countries.<br><br></div>

(ST, June 7).<br><br>Mr Tan's article poses a number of questions about weapons of mass destruction (WMD) in Iraq. Other people have asked similar questions. But the search for WMD is still ongoing. Nobody at this point in time can say conclusively that there was no WMD in Iraq.<br><br>Objectively, therefore, we should await the findings of the experts instead of passing judgment based on assumptions or beliefs. But the more disturbing assertion in Mr Tan's commentary is the implication that WMD was the sole reason which led Singapore to support the war on Iraq. This is not so.<br><br>Let me reiterate and elaborate on the Singapore Government's position. First of all, the Government is not embarrassed by what, in Mr Tan's judgment, is the so-called 'glaring failure' of the Americans to find WMD. We have taken a strong, principled and consistent position on Iraq based on Singapore's national interests.<br><br>Foreign Minister S. Jayakumar had set out Singapore's position clearly and comprehensively in his statement in Parliament on March 14, which may be accessed on the MFA website www.mfa.gov.sg He made it very clear that our support for action against Iraq hinged on wider concerns than just its WMD.<br><br>A key concern was the need for all United Nations members to scrupulously comply with UN Security Council (UNSC) resolutions. Hence, we insisted on the need for Iraq to disarm immediately and comply with all UNSC resolutions.<br><br>This position dates back to the First Gulf War when we joined the international community to condemn Iraq's invasion of Kuwait. Since then, it had persistently defied the UNSC for more than 12 years, flouting 17 UNSC resolutions. Iraq obstructed the UN for many years, forcing the UN to withdraw its weapons inspectors, leaving a four-year hiatus without any inspections.<br><br>In November last year, the UNSC unanimously found Iraq in material breach of its obligations. UNSC Resolution 1441 (2002) gave Iraq a final opportunity to disarm voluntarily or face serious consequences.<br><br>Iraq failed to do so and, given its proven record of deception and defying UNSC resolutions, there was no way of being sure about what it may or may not possess without moving into Iraq and removing Saddam Hussein.<br><br>Saddam made no secret of his desire to acquire WMD. He actually used chemical weapons against his own people. And the search for WMD in Iraq is not over. We should not prejudge the outcome.<br><br>Singaporeans cannot afford to strike postures fashionable with the oppositionist media in America and Britain at the expense of the security of Singaporeans.<br><br>Should we have waited until the Jemaah Islamiah exploded bombs in Singapore before acting against it? Similarly, should the US have waited until all its critics were convinced before acting against Saddam?<br><br>A small nation in terrorist-infested South-east Asia does not have this luxury of libertarian posturing.<br><br>TAN LIAN CHOO<br>Press Secretary<br>to the Foreign Minister<br></div>

Hindsight is a wonderful thing.<br><br>When the decision was made to go with the United States it was done conscientiously, in the name of prevention. For some, a situation is not real until it exists.<br><br>The 9/11 situation in America was predicted, by its intelligence agencies, as a possibility but no one paid too much attention to it because it was not real until it happened, and by then it was too late.<br><br>Singapore was right to go on the empirical knowledge it had about the dictator, as well as other available information.<br><br>To foresee a possible tragedy, or to discern one in the making, and not do anything would be a pretermission of grave responsibility to the people who voted the Government into power. Whether it is the arrest of one, or a group of subversives, who have not brought their destructive designs into reality, or to support the removal of a dictator whom history has shown will not hesitate to annihilate his relatives, own people (Kurds) or neighbour (Kuwait), this cannot be called a rash act, or one made to feather our nest, as implied.<br><br>The alternative is to do nothing, or fail to do anything, to prevent a possible disaster because others believe it is unjust to take preventive action before the event.<br><br>If this is so, in containing Sars we took unjust action in curbing personal liberty, to some measure, in anticipation of infection of others.<br><br>Singapore, therefore, did what was right and that was to protect its citizens from any possible harm.<br><br>We must make the effort to help ourselves before we can expect others to help us.<br><br>DUDLEY AU<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Well, the principal reason behind Singapore's support can be summed up in 1 word: Money<br><br>- Money from reconstruction opportunities in Iraq.<br><br>- Money from fast-tracking the US-Singapore FTA<br><br>- Money that will be pumped into the local economy when the US sees Singapore as an ally which allows use of facilities for stopovers and prepositioning of equipment.<br><br>Theres also the small matter of what we perceive as security by aligning with the lone superpower in the world. For Singapore's sake I hope we're hedging all our bets on the right horse.<br><br>The MFA reply does contain a few factual errors:<br><br>UNSC Resolution 1441 never allowed use of military action against Iraq. The specific language was "serious consequences" but it also specified a new resolution was required to declare war on Iraq. So 1441 doesn't authorise war on Iraq, neither did ANY other resolutions pertaining to Iraq's WMD<br><br>SEA terrorist infested? I'll admit SEA has a terrorist problem, but its not like you can't throw a stone in SEA without hitting a terrorist.<br><br>You can't compare action JI with Iraq, one is a terrorist group, the other a sovereign state, Saddam Hussein or not. Invading Iraq without UN mandate is a violation of the UN Charter, taking pre-emptive action against JI is not.</div>
