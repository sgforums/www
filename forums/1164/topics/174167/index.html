            <div class='col-md body'>Fighting NATO is already hard enough on it. No way on earth could they fight the PLA and NATO on two different fronts separated by thousands of kilometers. After all, it was just a period of sour relations, that's all. I don't see much profit to be gained by attacking their communist 'brothers' at the cost of fighting a two-front war.<br><br>At the most they would have kept a holding force behind in the East just in case the US Seventh Fleet decided to attack the Soviets there. Oh, and to hold back any possible Chinese invasions until reinforcements could be sent there. No way can the Soviets invade China.</div>

Robert Leonhard regarding this issue:<br>"The development of AirLand Battle began with the assignment of Gen. Donn Starry as TRADOC commander in 1977. An experienced armor officer and former corps commander, Starry served to focus attentionon what he referred to as the "Central Battle" - a future decisive confrontation between NATO and Warsaw Pact forces in Europe. With growing concern over the expansion and modernization going on within the Warsaw Pact, officers in TRADOC and V Corps developed of mathematical, computer-assisted "battle calculus" with which to study the huge decisive battle they envisioned.<br>.......................................................................................<br>Inevitably, battle calculus had to reveal the bad news: even factoring in the latest technology and equipment that the West could offer, the force ratios and anticipated loss rates in the Central Battle would eventually produce a Warsaw Pact victory........................

            <div class='col-md body'>Other than the readable and almost believeable Clancy's "Red Storm Rising" , there has been a lot of material of "what if"; others more improbable than some.<br><br>Far as I can make a final analysis, both NATO and Wasaw Pact were preparing for very different wars. NATO thought that the WP would use chemical, spanez attacks and big stick OMG manuvers; while WP thought NATO would preempt "Airland" like in Iraq/Kuwait in 1990. Both were wrong, nothing happened.<br><br>Forget Alan Toffland's "the next war" or Inforwar, what took everyone by suprize was 9-11 and the collaspe of economic infrastructure of USSR. The real 'cause bellus' (Sp?) of next war is water and energy ...and maybe diseases (AIDS and H5N1 pandemic).<br><br>China is already feeling that security of water is paramount. Japan went to war in 1941 over energy. H5N1 fatality rate is 50%.<br><br>In a toss-up between systems (eg. NATO vs WP or other previous "head to head, line in the sand" situations), what matters is not what technology or political beliefs exists but more proasic concerns like survival and 'way of life' arguments. Nothing sharpens the senses like extermination and "us vs them".</div>
