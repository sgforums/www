            <div class='col-md body'>Soft interogation - bring you to a room (cant confirm since i was blind folded) for questioning. They will use tricks to make you talk, using cigs, food etc. Never Never take the bait. Just tell them your rank name and ic, dun be smart alec, keep your mouth shut. Anyway, for me they suddening kicked the chair and i fell on the floor ... took me by complete surprise. That's the easy part.<br><br>Hard interogation - crawl in mud, water hose up your nose and inside the mouth (we didn't had water tub in those days, thank god), dench with ice water, kneel on rocky ground and move on knees (pityful), various exercises, iguana crawl* on rocky ground and best of all, kneeling with a piece of wood stuck btw thigh and calf while the "cardre" hold (push) your body downwards, pure pain * flash back* two of my course mates cried, damn depressing while waiting for your turn.<br><br>* Iguana crawl - crawl on belly (hands are tied behind the back while holding the foot up), only way to move is to use your thigh and shoulder. Improvised version, same as standard version except with wood ( tree branch) stuck btw thigh and calf. I had it all <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_sad.gif" alt="Sad" title="Sad"> No sure if they still do it. For me, it's the worst part of the training.<br><br>I had to go thru two rounds, the second was quicker but damn sian when they call out my number. Soft intero - 10 min  per session, hard - 20 to 30 mins per session, seems hours though. The course i went thru only had 20 plus trainees, so they had plenty of time to toy (fool?!?) around. Think the course is much larger nowadays, thus shorter "personal" treatment?!?!?<br><br>Anyway, course should have toned down since the unfortunate incident. My heart goes the victim and his family.<br><br>Rest of the training was good (especially survival training). 3 days without food and water. dun worry there are plenty of fruit trees and wild boar pits.<br>For me, water was the main problem damn thirsty. Dun try to take food from recruit camp, integity man. Cardre came in the middle of the night and chop doen our hut, had to rebuild before first light, luckily they kept away on th second night.<br><br>Overall, physically and mentally demanding course, just endure the POW treatment.<br><br>btw, i'm serious with toilet breaks. They untied my hands so i can pee. Thye still ave a humane side.</div>
