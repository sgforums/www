            <div class='col-md body'>In Singapore, I frankly doubt if the military will step in to remove a duly elected government. The issues I see are this:-<br><br>1) it is not in our nature/ culture to intervene in a violent or potentially violent way in affairs of the state<br>2) as the military commander in Singapore, you are faced with several dilemmas all happening at the same time. THe top 2 dilemmas you face are the loyalty of your troops , bearing in mind they are conscripts and in fact they may have elected the same government you are trying to oust. The other dilemma is what if you do not get the support of the police and other army units and in turn you are branded as the "traitor". We Singaporeans are too conservative to put our necks out.<br>3) the fact that the military considers stepping in , is in itself a "nuclear option". Just imagine the economic chaos that Singapore will be in.  Foreign investment will stop immediately and foreign labour will move out, stock market will crash. Singapore has no natural resources to sustain herself , unlike our neighbours. I think our commanders are sensible and pragmatic enough to consider this as important.<br><br>The likely scenario ( and I believe what the government is trying to imply) is where another political party, probably very radical in ideology, has replaced the PAP as the dominant party in Parliament.  Then the military may act if they are convinced that such radicalism will also cause a downfall of Singapore. In which case, the nuclear option is no longer a non-viable option, since to do nothing in the face of radicalism will also be damaging to Singapore.</div>

Anyway, anyone has ideas of where Thaksin is headed? I suppose he will be headed here, but would his family be given round the clock protection? Anyway,just to stray alittle, his daughter is hot!!!</div>
