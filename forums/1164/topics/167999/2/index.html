            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote>Some people really ARE pompous aren't they?  Here's a hush-hush secret for you all... Not everything revolves around you. And not everything revolves around Singapore.</blockquote>A statement more relevant for the policy-makers of the the Malaysian government. Some sense of sanity have since returned lately with Badawi in charge though. But a particular invalid grunts from the sidelines every now and then. But he`s losing his touch or influence.<br><br>The Thaksin government may have erred in thier response to the incessant attacks on his southern border. Not to mention a real policy failure there. The Malaysian government would probably not do any better. And a Malaysian government sympathetic to the plight of Malays there makes the job for Thailand all the more difficult.. Plus open-houses on para-military camps to get weapons for free in Malaysia.<br><br>Malaysia`s recent purchases are meant to replace old inventories and to increase her over-all capability vis-a-vis developments around the region and the world. But poor coordination, lack of funds, internal corruption and (i feel) confusion as to ways to move forward make thier job difficult. Just look at their NGPV project. It`s abysmal. But that`s them. It`s thier country. They run it the way they want it.<br><br>Calling it an `Arm`s race' is to simply generalize the whole matter. On one hand, you have countries modernizing thier inventories to make them more relevant in the world. This would encourage others to do the same. On the other hand, you would need to take into account the status-quo and strategic circumstances in the region.<br><br>For our parts, it is only necessary that we remain one step ahead though the gap is certainly large right now. Singapore`s immediate threat is Malaysia and Indonesia. That will be the case for a long time to come.<br><br>China is certainly not an immediate threat to Malaysia and Malaysia, like the rest of SEA, is totally incapable of matching her military`s growth pound by pound. All countries in SEA would have to do thier part in balancing the new spheres of influence from India and China. At any rate, Malaysia would be more comfortable with China than the US though they are hardly bed-fellows. I think China certainly cares less and is more interested in ensuring she increases her influence in the region.[/code]</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>NEW DELHI: China's growing naval ambitions have for long been worrying India. But for the first time, there is evidence of how much effort the Indian agencies have put in to monitor the neighbour's growing military prowess.  The evidence available with DNA is also a rare peak into India's growing snooping abilities beyond its immediate borders.<br><br>Sources say that Indian surveillance capabilities have been pressed into full steam to monitor the latest acquisition of Chinese military: two Russian submarines acquired in October. DNA is in possession of a photograph, taken from a Tupalov-142 long-range maritime reconnaissance aircraft that was pressed into service to monitor the two Chinese submarines while they were somewhere near the Cape of Good Hope.<br><br>The new Kilo class submarines are on their way to China.<br><br>The entire surveillance exercise started sometime in last week of October when Peoples Liberation Army Navy took possession of the two submarines that were part of an order placed with Russia in 1996 for four of them. Two were taken possession of by 1998. The submarines, mounted on a massive Merchant Vessel Tai an Kou, left St Petersburg, passed to Atlantic Ocean and reached the Cape of Good Hope, when the Indian surveillance capabilities picked it up.<br><br>Ever since the merchant vessel has been under surveillance, believed to be primarily by Navy's Tu-142 maritime reconnaissance aircraft based in Chennai. The Russian planes are capable of flying non-stop for some 16 hours, and have highly advanced abilities to pick up low-noise nuclear submarines and also take extremely powerful images like the one with DNA.<br><br>The Navy rarely speaks about the exact role of the aircraft and seldom has the public been told about its abilities and the role it plays. The Chinese submarines rounded the Cape of Good Hope sometime around November 20 and are now believed to be somewhere in the Indian Ocean.<br><br>Though India has been concerned about China's growing naval capabilities, there is very little that it can do to stop the massive military sales between China and Russia. In fact China and India are Russia's biggest military buyers.<br><br>Source : <a href="http://dnaindia.com/report.asp?NewsID=1000163" rel="nofollow">http://dnaindia.com/report.asp?NewsID=1000163</a></div>
