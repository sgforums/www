            <div class='col-md body'>As much as I hope it'll never come to this but have anybody thought bout how they would react if the SAF gets smashed in battle? Don't you think its victory disease if we keep thinking that we're simply gonna blitzkrieg through any potential adversary. How would the general population react if news reports keep coming about one or more of our combined arms divisions being surrounded and pounded into submission? Personally, I don't expect any mercy. If it ever came to such a situation,thats it for Singapore as a sovereign state man.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I don't think the kind of war the SAF fights is one that is for explicitly offensive gains. A pre-emptive strike is possible but I highly doubt it is our plan to go all imperial-japanese on other nations- and I certainly hope not. The NSF duty is to protect Singapore and what the matters, not go about some political hyperpower projection.<br><br>As for victory disease I think you have to <span style="font-style: italic;">win</span> some victories first before you can get it. Defeated armies tend to change and learn from their mistakes while an opponent that has won might be tempted to keep to an increasingly outdated battle plan.<br><br>I for one do not think that the average soldier of the SAF cannot fight if push comes to shove, but leadership is another big issue... where a lot of the higher leaders might not be fighting men as much as they tend to be book-smart scholars farming cash with little idea of what is happening on the ground.<br><br>I think "peacetime disease" is a larger problem for the SAF, where the whole thing becomes so tilted towards standards, apperances and processes to run the military so efficently in peacetime that actual combat ability is compromised. That is a greater danger I think... I wonder how the nation would react if NSFs really had to fight in some conflict... would the parents start to protest?</div>
