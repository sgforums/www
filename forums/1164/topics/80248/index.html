On the procurement timeline, the NGF (Rafale, Typhoon, F-15) is next, perhaps within the next 5 years. At the end of the foreseeable line is the JSF. Singapore requires a fighter to replace the F-16s sometime within the next decade, thats where the JSF comes in.<br><br>The US is very particular nowadays about exporting arms, especially such a high technology stealth fighter, so its important for Singapore to at least have a part in its development to secure her chances of buying the plane.</div>

In fact for the JSF it is consider faster already it will come out less than 10 yrs. Looking at the market, there is nothing in the market that in the class of JSF, so it is only nature Singapore is interested. Think singapore is interested in the VSTOL version also <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"> .<br><br>We have to keep spreading out our purchase, so at least we have a good mixed of aircrafts, which mean there is alway so latest, some mid life and some phasing out. If we wait, we may end up with a unbalance airforce, and suddenly find we have to replace everything at one goal, which is too expensive as cost of planes ,equipment and training is not well spread out.</div>
