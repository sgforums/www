            <div class='col-md body'>U.S. Special Forces Playing Key Role in Iraq War<br>Wed April 2, 2003 11:16 PM ET<br>By Will Dunham<br><br>WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. military's special forces are playing a key role in the Iraq war, as illustrated by the rescue of American prisoner of war Jessica Lynch.<br><br>Officials said on Wednesday that a team of Army Rangers, Navy SEALs and Air Force pilots rescued Lynch in a nighttime raid from a hospital near Nassiriya in southern Iraq. Lynch, 19, had been captured on March 23 in an ambush by Iraqi forces of an Army supply convoy.<br><br>"There's a reason why you have regular units, and we're seeing right now you need them to hammer the Republican Guard. But if you understand the need for the broad sword, you should also understand the need for the dagger," said retired U.S. Army Col. Kenneth Allard of the Center for Strategic and International Studies.<br><br>U.S. defense officials lauded contributions made by U.S., British and Australian elite special forces, but said much of their activities remained secret.<br><br>"The western corridor of Iraq is owned by special forces -- British, Australian and U.S. special forces. So that's pretty significant -- let alone all the other operations they're doing in the other areas of the country," a U.S. defense official, speaking on condition of anonymity, told Reuters.<br><br>The special forces are units of the U.S. armed services that carry out commando missions such as rescues, manhunts, secretive attacks, spotting bombing targets and reconnaissance, often deep in enemy territory. There are an estimated 45,000 U.S. military special operations troops.<br><br>The CIA also conducts paramilitary operations of its own, relying mostly on former military officers.<br><br>Special operations long have been part of the American military, as well of the militaries of many other nations. For example, "Merrill's Marauders," led by Brig. Gen. Frank Merrill, clandestinely penetrated deep behind enemy lines in the Burmese jungle in World War II, disrupting Japanese supply and communication lines and capturing a key air field.<br><br>"Special forces are of growing importance in an era in which you are combating not just conventional militaries but a whole range of new threats," said analyst Daniel Goure of the Lexington Institute, a defense think tank.<br><br>The Afghanistan war launched in 2001 put the spotlight on special forces like never before. Military special forces and CIA paramilitary personnel called in air strikes from warplanes using precision-guided bombs, and worked with opposition fighters to drive the ruling Taliban from power.<br><br>But efforts to track down Osama bin Laden, blamed by Washington for the Sept. 11 attacks, failed.<br><br>Special operations troops were present inside Iraq even before the official start of the war. In the Kurdish-controlled north, they helped pave the way for the insertion of Army paratroopers. In the west, they seized key air fields and searched for Scud missiles.<br><br>They also seized a dam that U.S. officials had feared the Iraqis might destroy in order to flood the battlefield.<br><br>Analysts said other chores being assigned to these forces include: searching for suspected chemical and biological weapons; hunting for Iraqi government leaders, including President Saddam Hussein; reconnaissance; coordinating efforts with opposition forces including Iraqi Kurds; and rescue missions.<br><br>"They're playing a much bigger role in this Gulf War than they did the last time. (U.S. commander) Gen. (Tommy) Franks is using them far more extensively than (1991 Gulf War commander Gen. Norman) Schwarzkopf did," said Mike Vickers, who spent 13 years as a U.S. special forces and CIA officer and is now an analyst with the Center for Strategic and Budgetary Assessments.<br><br><a href="http://reuters.com/newsArticle.jhtml;jsessionid=E2AL5ZY4J40YWCRBAELCFFA?type=focusIraqNews&amp;storyID=2498860" rel="nofollow">http://reuters.com/newsArticle.jhtml;jsessionid=E2AL5ZY4J40YWCRBAELCFFA?type=focusIraqNews&amp;storyID=2498860</a></div>

FULGHUM/WASHINGTON<br><br>In what may have been one of the most rapidly executed missions of the war so far, two F-117s of the 8th Expeditionary Fighter Squadron planned, loaded weapons, flew to Baghdad and bombed a residence where Saddam Hussein was spending the night--all in 4 hr.<br><br>For the Mar. 19 mission that kicked off the conflict, members of the target cell in the combined air operations center (CAOC) at Prince Sultan AB, Saudi Arabia, chose the EGBU-27 1-ton penetrating bomb.<br><br>Two of the four bombs were dropped from an aircraft flown by Lt. Col. Mathew McKeon, commander of the unit.<br><br>"They had directed the use of those weapons, and we agreed," McKeon said. "That was a good choice because it took weather out of the equation. The EGBU-27 allows us to go ahead and drop with the [combined] GPS/INS guidance. But if we can see the target, we can also lase it [for even greater accuracy]."<br><br>However, the assignment must have come as somewhat of a shock because no one in the squadron had ever dropped one of those weapons.<br><br>"It had just been released to us in the last month or so," McKeon said.

            <div class='col-md body'>Big deal... it was designed to be survivable, but not invincible. Gevn right conditions, it will go down. What's so surprising? What matter is not if one unit is lost, but how well the system has been doing so far, and in the case of the A-10, it has been doing fantastic work.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Iraqi opposition wary of US governing plan<br>The Jerusalem Post<br><br>April 8, 2003<br><br>The day after the war could be today. With US forces biting off huge chunks of sprawling Baghdad, Iraqi opposition groups have grown restive as the imposition of an American military governorship for the next six months to a year seems inevitable.<br><br>Hamed al-Bayati, spokesman for the Shi'ite-led Supreme Council for Islamic Revolution in Iraq, warned that Iraq's Shi'ites, who constitute 65 percent of the country's population, could rebel should the US overstay its welcome.<br><br>"We've told our people to reject a military governorship," said Bayati in a telephone interview with The Jerusalem Post. "Appointing an American military governor is going to be counterproductive. We're going to see many fundamentalist groups use this as a pretext for attack."<br><br>They cite Afghanistan and Kuwait after the last Gulf War as examples of states that were immediately granted their independence. The fear, Bayati added, that the US appetite for oil motivates its impending decision to establish a military governorship haunts both Iraqis and the Arab world.<br><br>But the Supreme Council, headed by Iranian-hosted Ayatollah Muhammad Baqir al-Hakim, are alone in believing that "Iraqis are fully capable and have the right to control their own country and govern themselves."<br><br>For its part, the US contends that it is already setting the stage for the Iraqi opposition. It revealed Monday that it airlifted Iraqi National Council leader Ahmed Chalabi and some 600 Iraqi exiles to Nasiriyah to reduce tensions.<br><br>The Kurds of northern Iraq, steeled by centuries of statelessness into pragmatists, are burdened by no illusions that Iraq will be granted immediate autonomy.<br><br>The Kurdish Democratic Party (KDP) and the Patriotic Union of Kurdistan (PUK) are the only Iraqi opposition groups to hold territory inside Iraq. Though Iraqi Kurdistan is recognized on no map, the hardscrabble mini-state the two organizations slapped together is possibly one of only two democracies in the Middle East. Internet access is open and it boasts relative freedom of expression, a market economy, and now blossoming relations with the US.<br><br>"One cannot expect Iraqis to practice democracy so quickly. There can't be democracy without food, water, or electricity," a KDP official told the Post Monday.<br><br>Whereas coalition forces were met in the Shi'ite stronghold of Basra with fierce resistance, and at best neutrality, in Iraqi Kurdistan US Special Forces were literally pelted with flowers and dragged into homes for tea.<br><br>The Kurds like to say that they have "no friends but the mountains," but in this war, says the KDP source "it was like a dream. We never had any power, much less a super military power, in our side. Every other army has fought us, from the Turks to the Syrians, the Iranians and Iraq."<br><br>As many as 60,000 Kurdish Peshmerga, or fighters, are working under the Special Forces to quell regime strongholds in northern Iraq. In addition, the US is about to airlift 3,000 Iraqis in exile, many of them Kurds, back to Iraq to act as liaisons to the Iraqi people.<br><br>Bayati's comment drew the wrath of some opposition members who consider it an attempt to scuttle Iraq's only shot at stability. "The Shi'tes' mentality never changes," said a source from the PUK, "Why did they not rise up against Saddam? His was an irresponsible statement reflecting the position of leaders in Iran. But if [Ayatollah] Hakin arrived in Najaf, I doubt we'd have another similar statement."<br><br>"The Shi'ites don't trust Americans as we do," said the PUK source, "they need time, things are changing. They don't trust the foreign armies, but it is our position that the Americans are here not to occupy but to rebuild Iraq."<br><br>The concoction of Kurds loyal to the US and Shi'ites itching for immediate autonomy could be explosive, believes Ofra Benjo, an Iraq specialist at Tel Aviv University's Dayan Center.<br><br>Iraq has a long history of violence, she said. "This might eventually compel the US to utilize the tools of Saddam to enforce its rule. The question is how much power America wants to give the Shi'a."<br><br>"The burden to engineer a new society is upon them," Benjo added. She estimates that a bloody decade could pass before the US has transformed a Muslim-Arab society into a Western-style democracy.<br></div>
