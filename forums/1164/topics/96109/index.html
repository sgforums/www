            <div class='col-md body'>Seriously speaking, other than telling us the time of exposure of snap targets, there is no special requirement on the time taken to engage a target and fire off.<br><br>A hasty shot is never a good shot. Let's say that you are going to engage a moving target. What I do is to suck it in, watch the target move, plant my crosshairs ahead of the target, then constrict my air passage, slowly leaking out my breathe, and when the target reaches a known distance from my sights, do a quick snatch, all the while maintaining the "leak" even after the shot has been fired. That's due to a need to follow through. You can't do that with an M-16 though, the trigger pressure is too high, you risk missing from a snatch, but you can do that with an SSG due to its very light trigger weight and supported prone position.<br><br>Special care need to be taken for trigger modification also. For stationary targets, smooth trigger action is suitable. For snap targets, consider a double pressure.</div>

It's called the "crack and thump". The human sensory memory mechanism consists of this component called echoic memory(sonic). Echoic memory retains information for 7-8 seconds before it is being forgotten, compared to the human iconic memory (sight and vision) which lasts for only half to 1 sec. Unless actively excercised and recalled the moment it becomes registered, it will be virtually permanently lost within 10 sec. The echoic memory store retains whatever your brain registers while your central processing is busy with other stuff ie. running for cover, and is recalled and processed after that. Yes, you can count the seconds. But usually that is the business of the sniper, not normal infantry. Counter sniping uses this to find the other sniper.</div>

I doubt its true...probably a technical problem that caused them to made an emergency landing and somehow got caught. Anyway anti apache people have been using this case against the apache while the friendly people up north have been using this incident to make their case against SAF.<br>The flight of around 30 apaches were shot up pretty badly but I dun think any crash, I may be wrong though. Many were grounded due to the damage. Its actually a tatical error by the commanders for sending them in without any air support and far from any friendly forces.</div>
