            <div class='col-md body'>Fromt Strait Times Webby:<br><br>TOKYO - JAPAN was reported yesterday to be considering selling decommissioned warships to Singapore and Malaysia to fight terrorism and piracy, following a recent relaxation in Tokyo's long-time ban on arms exports.<br><br>When asked to comment on the Japanese newspaper reports, a spokesman for Singapore's Ministry of Defence told The Straits Times: 'There is no truth to the report.'<br><br>Malaysia also said it had not received any such offers.<br><br>Quoting government officials, Japan's Yomiuri Shimbun said Tokyo would propose selling used 1,000-2,000 tonne-class compact destroyers and other warships belonging to the Self-Defence Force, as well as Coast Guard patrol vessels.<br><br>If Japan eventually decides to sell the vessels, it would inform Singapore and Malaysia next month, when its arms export ban was relaxed, said the Yomiuri, whose report was lifted by the Associated Press wire agency.<br><br>The plan to sell used warships was a response to calls for help from South-east Asian nations in fighting terror and piracy threats, the Yomiuri said.<br><br>It added that the warships would be exported minus the cannons and other heavy armament because they were not needed to fight pirates.<br><br>Currently, decommissioned warships are scrapped.<br><br>Analysts, however, have questioned the Yomiuri report, with Dr Khoo How San, a defence analyst at the Institute of South-east Asian Studies in Singapore, saying he found it 'puzzling and intriguing'.<br><br>'Nowadays, it's what's inside warships that count, not outside. The older warships are useless to us.<br><br>'The Japanese could also be floating a trial balloon but the reactions are more likely to be flak than positive vibes. Countries in the region are not ready to embrace Japan as an arms supplier,' Dr Khoo told The Straits Times.</div>

Older warship usually are less automated and had a higher manning requirements.<br><br>Can't see how an obsolete destroyer typed warship could help fight terrorism. Maybe some patrol boats will be suitable. But how many PVs do we need?? and where are we going to find the people to man them.<br><br>Why not offer them free to the Philippines' Navy!

            <div class='col-md body'>Again - Japan said it'll strip the vessels bare, &amp; it's gonna be all hardware if we choose to buy. The submarines we purchased from Sweden in the latter '90s were all 25-30 years old &amp; post-decommissioned, but which we evaluated &amp; found of excellent value for refurnishment.<br><br>In any case I think we're getting lumped together with Malaysia (who has the bigger NGPV ambitions) &amp;, while I said we don't need more heavy capital ships per se, it's more with the presumption that we're already committed to building the stealth frigates. Dunno about the S'pore version, but the latter's cousin ships have a standard displacement of 3,500 tonnes (French La Fayette class) &amp; 4,500 tonnes (Saudi Al Riyadh class), according to an online site. In other words, S'pore already wanted bigger vessels to complement our corvettes &amp; attack craft, to serve as conventional maritime security - rather than just chase pirates.<br><br>Let's see what Japan actually offers; we can always say no thanks.<br></div>

This been classified by navy expert being the most powerful warship in the region except the japan aegis destroyers which they have only 4 themselves !!!<br><br>By the way of course japan will not be sell these 4 Aegis !!! they intend to sell us scraps of some old warship !!!
