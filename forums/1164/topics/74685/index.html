'When one of my friends questioned his action, the group of senior trainees attacked us.'<br><br>He did not mention if the groups of trainees were from different racial groups. But he said he and other trainees were assaulted because they refused to pay a sum of money to the senior trainees.<br><br>In Penang, camp officials found two tubes of methamphetamine crystals in the bag of a female trainee.<br><br>Sources told The Straits Times that cases of sexual relations between trainees have also been uncovered but it was not a widespread problem.<br><br>The authorities say although most trainees are disciplined, the fights and riots raised the concerns of parents pressing for solutions to problems in various camps.<br><br>The national service scheme consists of three months of military boot camp, community services and character building courses.<br><br>About 27,000 youngsters aged 18 began their compulsory national service last month, the first of three batches of 85,000 selected by computerised lottery.<br><br>The scheme was conceived by the administration of former prime minister Mahathir Mohamad to reverse years of racial polarisation.<br></blockquote></div>
