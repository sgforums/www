And the HQ is called battalion HQ and the CO is the Battalion Commander.<br><br>Confusing, right?<br><br>Actually does anyone know the difference between a battalion and a regiment? or is it just semantics - different word same meaning.</div></blockquote>Regiments are not battalions. Here, all infantry battalions are part of the Singapore Infantry Regiment family. The formal name during ceremonial parades, for example, is 544th Battalion, Singapore Infantry Regiment. There is only one Singapore Infantry Regiment, consisting of many infantry battalions.<br>The regiment can be a family of battalions, based on history, function, formation, training, etc, etc.<br>In Singapore, its just a grouping of the infantry formation, for training, doctrine, etc.<br>Battalions from the regiment are distributed across brigades and divisions for operational purposes.<br><br>Other examples - the Royal Malay Regiment in Malaysia, consists of only Malay soldiers. The regiment contains battalions of infantry, mechanised infantry and airborne infantry. For ceremonial purposes - they use their own unique number 1 uniform during parades. Also, for operational purposes, the various battalions of the Royal Malay Regiment are distributed across brigades and divisions.<br><br>The Royal Ranger Regiment in Malaysia, also consists of infantry, mechanised infantry and airborne infantry battalions. The regiment takes its name from some historical unit during the British times. If I'm not mistaken - the Royal Ranger Regiment accepts non-Malays within its ranks. Again, for operational purposes, the various battalions are distributed across brigades and divisions.<br><br><a href="http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/world/india/rgt.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/world/india/rgt.htm</a> Regiments and battalions in the Indian Army explained.<br><br>In any case, Singapore's military consists of mostly conscripts and focus is mostly on vocation/skills training only. All the ceremonial formalities and military organisation is often ignored, and nobody bothers anyway.<br><br></div>
