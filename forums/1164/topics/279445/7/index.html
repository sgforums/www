On the last day of the 5 day battle for the atoll, Company F, 32nd Infantry Regiment, found themselves pinned down by sniper fire. The men could not tell where it was coming from. The bullets paralyzed the men. Then they tried to dig deeper into the sand or cover themselves with palm fronds in an attempt to hide. For an hour the company "clung to the earth" just 150 yards short of the end of the atoll. One by one, ten soldiers were hit by the sniper fire and each time the medics risked their lives crawling forward to the wounded and dragging them back. The "will to go forward" had vanished. Only the arrival of tank support as a shield from the sniper fire energized the men of Company F to get up and move out towards their objective. They raked the ground in front of them with constant BAR fire, flushed out the sniper, knocked out enemy bunkers and cleared out the last enemy opposition on the atoll.</blockquote><blockquote>During the battles in the Ia Drang Valley in November 1965, the 1st Bn of the 7th Cavalry was attacked in force by North Vietnamese regulars. Despite the arrival of elements of the 2nd Bn 5th Cavalry, the 1st Bn was forced to fall back to its LZ and establish a defensive perimeter. An element of the 2nd Bn had been on the LZ all day, so the unit leaders did not make a thorough search of the area. However, a sniper had infiltrated onto the LZ and with one shot at close range severely wounded the A Co. Cmdr. Even after the enemy sniper had fired, he remained undiscovered. The damage to the morale of the unit was severe. They no longer felt secure even within their own defensive perimeter. One sniper firing one round instilled a sense of fear and insecurity into elements of two battalions.</blockquote><blockquote>On 12 June 1982, 3d Battalion, the Parachute Regiment, British Army, attacked Mt. Longdon, Falklands. Difficult terrain coupled with a well entrenched enemy made movement slow and dangerous. The snipers of the Argentine 7th Infantry Regiment kept the British busy with accurate fire during the day and (with the aid of U.S. made night vision devices) at night. At one point during the attack, an entire British company was held up for hours by a single Argentine sniper. "Men found themselves being hit more than once by the same sniper, a terrifying tribute to the accuracy of the Argentinean's fire." </blockquote>regarding the rocket...i didnt say that ...Gary did<br></div>
