            <div class='col-md body'>I think gary1910's post was very informative.<br><br>The Iraqi artillery were largely non-contributory also due to loss of communications to their fronts as well.  Neither did they have any reliable surveillance or recon assets they could use to target for their Astros.<br><br>The key to any indirect weapon deployment is information.  The artillery system needs to know WHERE to shoot, when to shoot. The Iraqis couldn't do anything simply cause the US military was able to maintain the chaos, and black out their comms at the same time.<br><br>To say that the Astros would be used to target "Somewhere" in Singapore, in hope of discouraging any military incursion from us is also a real probability.  Not impossible, if they decide to immediately adopt a cornered rat posture.<br><br>Otherwise, to simply dump rockets into Singapore would serve no purpose at all, while endangering their astros to detection and destruction.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>gary rightly pointed out that it is not correct to compare Scud and Astros. And the fear of Scud is not so much if it is just another artillery shell, but the possibility that it could deliver chemical warhead.<br><br>There are many ways to inflict fear and panic on the population by targetting civilians, Astros is just another delivery system of HE warheads, its impact is probably the same as a salvo of 155 mm artillery shells. I would think that when just one of the MY F18 manage to penetrate and drop a 1000 pound bomb anywhere in Woodland would have much greater impact, or a truck loaded with high explosive driven by suicide bomber, or a train exploded in tanjung pagar would also have cause greater fear and panic in Singapore.<br><br>there is really no need to over emphasize the impact of Astros, unless, it can deliver chemical warheads. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_twisted.gif" alt="Twisted Evil" title="Twisted Evil">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_twisted.gif" alt="Twisted Evil" title="Twisted Evil"></div>
