The concept of -guided- artelliry rockets is a new form of long range assault for ground forces that's more than in line with the long esthablished guided air dropped/air to surface/surface to surface munitions.  Hence you cant really say it's a "new" system.<br><br>Guided rockets means the seperation of missile/rockets have narrowed but cost and usage purpose being rather different.

LOL....man...<br><br>now, for a precision weapon system like HIMARS which u claim can land its rockets within 5 metre of a pin point at its stated range of 70 kilometres, why worry if u can keep on 'sniping' whilst at the same time see the opponents counter artillery had a good aim but see their rounds fell everywhere but the target.<br><br>BTW, have u considered that guided weapon systems are good as long as its guidence remain intact?  a bad weather and all of a sudden ur GPS go bonkers.  u may see ur rockets exploded in bintan instead of batam...</div>
