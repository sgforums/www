            <div class='col-md body'>Within 200m at range of 25km is pretty accurate gun for standard rds.<br><br>4PE =200m, so 1 PE is 200/4=50m, so the CEP is 50/25000=0.2%.<br><br>But the latter part, you have misunderstood the writer.<br><br>For example , let say the M777A1 battery of 6 need to destroy a SAM site at 25km away.<br><br>All 6 of them fire a burst rate of 3 standard rds at the target i.e. 18 rds, becos it will falls within 200m of target, it may or may not destroy the target, and probability get worst if the range is higher.<br><br>But with a GPS guided Excalibur rds, 2~3 rds should be sufficient to destroy the target with almost 100% certainty becos it will fall within 5~10m of the target, as long it is within max range.<br><br>So in reality, with Exclibur, it does not need as many ammo as in standard unguided rds in the above senario.<br><br>That's is also why traditionally, arty usually operate in battery of 6 or more, it is an area target weapon and the need to have many guns and rds to be effective but with GPS guided rds, it turn it into point target weapon.<br><br></div>

(FMTV) 5-Ton Trucks<br>1 M1089A1 Wrecker<br><br>Also included are support equipment, communications equipment, spare and repair parts, test sets, batteries, laptop computers, publications and technical data, personnel training and equipment, systems integration support, support services of a Quality Assurance Team and a Technical Assistance Fielding Team, United States (U.S.) Government and contractor engineering and logistics personnel services, and other related elements of logistics support.<br><br>The estimated cost is $330 million. This proposed sale will contribute to the foreign policy and national security of the United States by helping to improve the security of a friendly country that has been, and continues to be, an important force for economic progress in Southeast Asia.<br><br>The HIMARS will enhance SingaporeÂ’s military capability by providing a highly effective indirect area fire artillery system that is critical to successful deterrence and national defense. HIMARS supplements traditional cannon artillery by delivering high volume firepower in a short time against time-sensitive targets.<br><br>At shorter ranges, HIMARS complements tube artillery with heavy barrages against assaulting forces, counter-fire and defense suppression. Singapore will have no difficulty absorbing and integrating this system into its armed forces. The proposed sale of this equipment and support will not alter the basic military balance in the region.<br><br>The principal contractors will be: Lockheed Martin Missile and Fire Control at Dallas, Texas and Stewart &amp; Stevenson at Sealy, Texas. There are no known offset agreements proposed in connection with this potential sale.</blockquote><strong><a href="http://www.dsca.osd.mil/" rel="nofollow">http://www.dsca.osd.mil/</a></strong><br><img src="http://www.dsca.osd.mil/images/banner_2007.gif"><br><br><img src="http://www.sinaimg.cn/jc/2007-09-18/U1335P27T1D464514F3DT20070918093835.jpg"><br><strong><a href="http://mil.news.sina.com.cn/2007-09-18/0938464514.html" rel="nofollow">source of image</a></strong><br>Family Medium Tactical Vehicles (FMTV) 5-Ton Trucks</div>
