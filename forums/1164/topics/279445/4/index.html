while at the same time, these acquired tanks were supposed to provide direct support fire to SAF infantry fighting amidst the rubber estates and plantations commonly found in Singapore during the early 1960s.<br><br>It was only until Singapore had sufficient local expertise to set up an organisation that evolve into the present day DSTA, that equipment acquistions became more deliberate.<br><br>Since the existent of DSTA, Singapore's military equipment purchase is based on a clear and diligent research to the organisational doctrines that resulted in the needs and objectives for such millitary hardware; and with a purposeful and diligent search for the best existing equipment and platforms to meet such doctrinal needs to match the existing level of technical expertise available to handle the acquired hardware.<br><br>More importantly, the purchase of the various military hardware and platforms is based on the sound and professional research of an independent body and not based on the personal preference and choice of any Political Personality.<br><br>Obviously, the acquistion of what is needed by the SAF will also have to consider the comfort levels of our immediate neighbors so as not to cause unnecessary alarm; as well as for the acquired hardware to <span style="font-style: italic;">''fit and complement''</span> the general equipment standards of our immediate partner in the FPDA.<br><br>Under such circumstances, the SAF equipment  that do not complement the existing standards of our immediate FPDA partner, even after the equipment has been acquired - it will remain in the country of origin, with the SAF personnel being trained in its use in the host country.<br><br>Insofar as military sensitivity towards our neighbors, the Singapore Government has always been mindful not to be provocative.<br><br>Since the birth of the SAF in 1967, the sabre was rattled only twice by using the general mobilization call-up of essential components of the SAF - on both occassions, it was a direct response by aggressively hostile politicians urging the use of immediate force to abbrogate all agreements affecting our water supply.<br><br>Despite the consistent built-up of the SAF - in terms of technological quality and new military skills, Singapore has always kept the SAF at a very low profile - as reflected in the use of equipment that will complement the SAF exercise partners from other countries.<br><br>How this modest efforts can be seen as Singapore attempting to keep up with the northern Mats and the Sallehs surely must be a result of themselves being self-insecure ?<br></span><br></div>

North Country ought to feel worried IF we got those missiles and refused to comment about it.<br><br>IIRC, LKY mentioned that these missiles weren't aimed at anyone in particular, but were there to welcome those who have hostile intentions to Singapore.  Unless you're admitting that there are hostile intentions towards Singapore, you shouldn't feel offended.<br><br>All my life, I've never heard of Singapore responding to our neighborly squabbles with SAF unless we were first threatened with it.  Yet time and time again, North country's politicians scream for blood, lobbies the poisoning of reservoirs with chemical weapons and etc etc.  We only stood to defend interests vital to our national survival.<br><br>And then, there's all these accusations of RSAF aircraft intruding into M'sian airspace.  All this while no proof has been shown  to us that we have indeed done so.  All the accusations were based on "noise" and sightings by civilians.  Where are the radar tapes? Wheres the proof? None.<br><br>Finally, there's the notion of Pedra Branca being Malaysian' territory and request of joint military patrol while waiting for tribuna.  Again, M'sia brings in their "vaunted" arm forces on a unreasonable request.  Fortunately, they didn't like the idea of RSAF patroling KL skies when we suggested we make some claim on KL.  Its most unfortunate that we have to reciprocate in order for the northern politicians to see reason and logic.<br></div>
