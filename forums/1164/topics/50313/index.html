There was no explosion and it just went silent after that,' he said.<br><br>When contacted, a Ministry of Defence (Mindef) spokesman confirmed that the Skyhawk jet had made an emergency landing at 11.54 am yesterday.<br><br>'It experienced problems during a routine training exercise,' she said, adding that the damage to the plane was minor and that the pilot was not hurt.<br><br>Mindef will be conducting an inquiry to determine the cause of the incident, she added.<br><br>Super Skyhawks have taken part in the traditional flypast at National Day Parades.<br></div>
