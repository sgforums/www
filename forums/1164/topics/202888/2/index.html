            <div class='col-md body'>I feel that it is likely that Hezbollah  launch rockets o attack Israel with suicide bombings.  Now that you have a 4 ring circus on the ground, (Lebanese, UN, Hezbollah, Israel), they may actually launch surprise attack to lure Israel into retaliatory action and confrontation with UN and UN troops.<br><br>Whether the UN troops give way to the Israeli actions or stand against it (UN troops vs IDF?) would both reflect negatively of the UN's ability to "keep peace."  Again, world opinion would be unfavorable against the Israelis, and perhaps more will flock to the Hezbollah cause.<br><br>I'm not a seer, I'm just suggesting a probability.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>It's going to be tough to beat Hezbollah on the propangada front. Simply because Hezbollah's main idea is to cause as much damage as possible to their opponents physially or propangada wise and pitch that as a victory.<br><br>It dosen't matter if they have taken heavy losses or are military-wise gutted or have become a skeleton force. As long as they are able to keep talking and oppose Israeli with a minimal level of resistance they basically have things going for them. One rocket into Israeli, even if it causes very little damage is worth far more then several of their equipment and men killed by Israeli airstrikes.<br><br>It's going to be difficult for Israel to beat Hezbollah, for the simple reason it's hard to beat in the conventional sense. Nothing short of its total destruction would suffice, and that is very hard to do.</div>
