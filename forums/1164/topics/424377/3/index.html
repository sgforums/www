              <p>it doesnt matter if this is the 1st century or the 31st century.as long as men rule the planet there will be disorder.humans are destructive by nature and in each century from 1st century to 20th century humans have brought about death n destruction thru greed,stupidity,wanton violence and indifference.</p>
              <p>tell me which century or how many centuries did the human race saw any peace?i can tell u none........so whether it is the 21st century of 31st century there is always be imperfect humans who wanna run the whole show thinking they are the best.</p>
              <p>to say this is the 21st century and everything will be peaceful..........is extremely shortsighted.what makes u think the 21st xcentury is better n less violent than the 20th century or the 19th century??if u care to take a closer look..seems like the wars kill more thab ever as the centuries get more advanced!!!!hahaha..... think again!!!</p>

              <p>It's possible in the present century... If North Korea attacks South Korea, how much warning would SK have? Perhaps a few minutes before 100,000 shells a minute land.</p>
              <p>If you replace "shells" with "SCUDs" or "ASTROS", it's possible you may find yourself in the same situation.</p>
              <p>If the Indo government turns hostile, you will have strategic warning of a conventional buildup or terror plots years in advance, but that's about it.</p>
              <p>Say enemy MLRS are aimed at you and on permanent alert. Watcha gonna do about it?</p>
              <p>Say they fire a few rounds. Watcha gonna do? You don't see South Korea invading North Korea, or even retaliating over 60 years of provocation and hundreds of dead. And South Korea has the capacity to defeat and occupy North Korea. I don't think Singapore has the capacity to occupy even a single state or province of any other country. Even assuming you're allowed to draft other countries' citizens into the SAF. I believe they have the right to go home. Don't even think of putting them before a firing squad.</p>
              <p>This is a most unfavourable situation. Singapore has little deterrent to aggression beyond the ability to repel an enemy thrust, perhaps even decisively repel it, which *hopefully* leads to the collapse of the aggressor government.</p>

              <p>Will South Korea be surprised when 100,000 shells came down on them from the north this afternoon? No, the two countries are at technically at war with one another, and the south are always ready for such thing.</p>
              <p>Will Taiwan be surprised when hundreds of missiles rain down on Taipei tonight? Yes, even though  the missiles have been deployed at fujian facing taiwan for a long time. But the two sides are now on good term, and have their own people on the other sides, for tourism, for business, for visiting relatives....</p>
              <p>Will Singapore be surprised when suddenly a few Astros were fired at Singapore tomorrow? Yes, because Malaysia and Singapore are on the path of good relationship for better of our future, besides, there is no sign of any astros deployed in such as way that would threaten Singapore.</p>
              <p>There is more to starting a war than simply military maneuver. A tactical surprise is possible but not strategic surprise in this 21st century. But south korea, or Singapore will never wake up finding "....all tall buildings more than 20 floors will be torn down and execuations ....murdering  ....starvation....poisoned water...cholera..diarohea..burning everyday everywhere..men n wimen screamin ....murder,,burning..destruction...." </p>
              <p>a total destruction is possible if a terrorists in Russia or a rogue US general land an ICBM on us for whatever reason. When that happened, nobody will be around to scream or shout....of course, those who had run to oz would continue to blame the pap..... or may be they had been hoping for <span style='color: black; font-family: "Arial","sans-serif";' lang="EN-US">apocalypse in Singapore.</span></p>
              <p>The more likely scenario would be you get your routine recall but were issued live ammo and go into action without knowing what is happening. when that happened, you should be glad you were trained and you are armed.</p>

              Taipei tonight? Yes, even though  the missiles have been
              deployed at fujian facing taiwan for a long time. But the two sides
              are now on good term, and have their own people on the other sides,
              for tourism, for business, for visiting relatives....</p>
              <p>Will Singapore be surprised when suddenly a few Astros were
              fired at Singapore tomorrow? Yes, because Malaysia and Singapore
              are on the path of good relationship for better of our future,
              besides, there is no sign of any astros deployed in such as way
              that would threaten Singapore.</p>
              <p>There is more to starting a war than simply military maneuver. A
              tactical surprise is possible but not strategic surprise in this
              21st century. But south korea, or Singapore will never wake up
              finding "....all tall buildings more than 20 floors will be torn
              down and execuations ....murdering  ....starvation....poisoned
              water...cholera..diarohea..burning everyday everywhere..men n wimen
              screamin ....murder,,burning..destruction...." </p>
              <p>a total destruction is possible if a terrorists in Russia or a
              rogue US general land an ICBM on us for whatever
              reason. When that happened, nobody will be around to
              scream or shout....of course, those who had run to oz would
              continue to blame the pap..... or may be they had been
              hoping for <span>apocalypse in Singapore.</span></p>
              <p>The more likely scenario would be you get your routine recall
              but were issued live ammo and go into action without knowing what
              is happening. when that happened, you should be glad you were
              trained and you are armed.</p>

              <p>We make friends with all countries near and far through diplomatic, economic and cultural relations. We engage our neighboring countries to settle all disputes. We have no reason to believe they want to attack us. We build a strong defence during peace time, hopeful it is a strong enough deterrance for moron who might want to try their luck. We have sufficient means for early warning for any trouble, from an all out war to terrorists attack. We can sleep in peace, I can sleep in peace in Singapore.</p>
              <p>There are horrible places in the world, water are not drinkable even before anybody poison it. But there are also peaceful places in the world, Singapore is one of them. is the place you stay peaceful?</p>
              <p>Why do you fear that when you wake up in the morning you will get a mouth full of poisoned water when you brush your teeth? Why are you so scared that you would starve?</p>

              <p>It certainly are not the physical assets that matter, but the foreign reserves.</p>
              <p>If a country is completely occupied, other countries will freeze the reserves. But with time, when it is clear the situation is not reversible and there is more interest in developing trade than in holding grudges on behalf of a state that does not exist, they will be unfrozen for the victor's use. The other benefit is a distracting and unifying war for an unpopular regime. In some wars nationalism turns the people against opposition groups that are getting too popular.</p>
              <p>Actually the situation hitman described occurred in East Timor. The native population was either used as slave labour or suffered preventable deaths from abuse or deprivation.</p>

              <p>Hopefully this can continue for a few more decades and Taiwan can make the case at the international court for independence based on a century of separation, China's warlike actions and the starvation and destruction that Taiwan would have endured had China's invasion of Taiwan in the 50s succeeded.</p>
              <p>That will teach China to be more humble, to negotiate as equals.</p>
              <p>With reference to East Timor and Yugoslavia, regardless of past circumstances no country has a right to re-unite territories by force. They can go their own way.</p>
              <p>Japan just discovered rare earths on the seabed. Hopefully Taiwan can join Korea and Japan as a counterbalance to China, until such time it learns to behave.</p>

              <p>It is actually very very hard for us or for them to invade each other. dropping a few bombs from plane or missle (who has land based missle that can fly 600 miles across sea bet SG and Jkt?) in SEA?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>No one. So only land forces can do invasion. That is why blue water fleet is the only force projection in modern day. Both of us do not have it. Think of Desert storm - it was the largest logistic exercise in the history of men. It is no joke moving millions of tonnes of equipment, ammunition, POL (water, petrol, oil etc), food, people, vehicles, over even a small long kang of 10m. For 10m - already need to build bridges. What about 600 miles???</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>So it is left to who got better navy and air force  - so fight there. a few hundred sampans armed with a boatload of 12 soldiers each holding a rifle with 300+ bullets over rough seas is NOT going to harm people.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>but what is fearful are the hidden type - the lone ranger who slip in to plant dirty bombs or you know what lah....those will be so hard do detect. if you cannot detect you cannot protect or prevent easily.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>the only fear i have of indonesia is if their rich tourist stop coming to our casino that helped to make it number 1 or 2 now :)</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>so keep them coming and welcome their torist medical dollars. try Mount E - in any light any time of day - you hear bahasa spoken.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>so let there be peace...we co-exist happily :)</p>

              <p>It certainly are not the physical assets that matter, but the foreign reserves.</p>
              <p>If a country is completely occupied, other countries will freeze the reserves. But with time, when it is clear the situation is not reversible and there is more interest in developing trade than in holding grudges on behalf of a state that does not exist, they will be unfrozen for the victor's use. The other benefit is a distracting and unifying war for an unpopular regime. In some wars nationalism turns the people against opposition groups that are getting too popular.</p>
              <p>Actually the situation hitman described occurred in East Timor. The native population was either used as slave labour or suffered preventable deaths from abuse or deprivation.</p>

              <p>why compare Singapore with East Timor? even Kuwait is not a good comparison.</p>
              <p>Unless the UN recognizes the invader, there is no enforcement for anybody to give the occupier the frozen money, why can they simply keep the money for themselves? Iraq was a victor in kuwait for not very long, who else in the present era can occupy another country by force and became the bonefide owner of the land?</p>
              <p>Argentina attacked folkland to distract and try to unify the country under the unpopular regime, what happened next?</p>
              <p>The question boils down to Singaporean? Will We Fight? </p>
