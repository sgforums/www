            <div class='col-md body'><p>Indonesia lacks the force projection capability to attack mainland Singapore with a reasonable chance of sucess, whatever their size may be. Compare this to the easily mobilized and supplied Singapore military and it's going to be a bit of a force overmatch if they are trying to land troops on our shores. It's the ability to support  concentrate and bring your forces at the right place and time that matters. <br><br>So a outright invasion is out of the question given their current capability. What they can do however is to cut off sea routes and engage in low intensity warfare that will lead to economic and psychological attrition and it's the job of the Navy and Airforce to deal with these.</p></div>

              <p>On the Indonesian threat:</p>
              <p>I did not say the Whiskey class submarines are threatening, but were.  I typed everything in the past tense. Isn't that true when we had almost no navy?</p>
              <p>Their current "ex German Navy vessels which could not sail from sumatra to
                                                  sulawesi" are of course not a threat . They are used more for internal security to "police" their extensive island chain. Btw, if they literally cannot sail the distance, it's because some are not seaworthy and others are merely fast attack craft.</p>
              <p>On the maids:</p>
              <p>I would not necessarily agree on Javanese being "the most peaceful". The majority of Indonesian maids here are Javanese. When you read reports of  knife murders of employers and their children, most of the maids being unrepentant, "savage" is not an unfair statement. Undocumented child abuse and problem maids (some employers being at fault, some maids being lazy or genuinely "mental") being sent back are fact too. Incidentally many convicted maids escaped justice and were sent back after their trials. Probably for the sake of the Chinese in Indonesia.</p>
              <p>I also disagree that Indonesians are the most peaceful "among maids here". Send-back rates and crime rates are the reason Filipino maids are costlier. Indonesian maids are the cheaper and riskier option.</p>
              <p>It has nothing to do with race. You said that various Indonesian tribes are aggressive. They are not ethnically different from Javanese, but only culturally different. If you can fairly term them aggressive without being racist, I submit that they are aggressive attributing it not to race but to other factors. This fits in with how they treated the Chinese in 1998. The violence was certainly not isolated or sporadic, and sadly it was not even condemned. In this case, I hope it is not racist to call them racist.</p>

              <p>I suspect these "fighters" are more Hamas-type businessmen than true freedom fighters. Lose the war and they die, win the war and they go out of business. They are not interested in winning. Same for the army. As with all businessmen, don't get swindled.</p>
              <p>As for buying arms, that's quite hard when SGD will be worthless. We can't be doing manual labour, or even sell drugs. A few years ago, the police arrested some soldiers who were selling drugs. The army came and shot up the police station. Selling drugs is the surest way to get attention and die. (I have a feeling their families live on base and these guys don't book out, probably because the barracks are a palace. It's a different world there.)</p>
              <p>I suggest we consult some true veterans like these die-hard soldiers http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japanese_holdout</p>
