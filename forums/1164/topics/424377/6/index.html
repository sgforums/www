              <p>You can quote from Sun Tzu, but you need to know how to

              <p>You want to subdue your enemy without fighting - but
              when your enemy sinks your ship, and you dare not resist,  you
              are subdued already, and it is they who have broken your
              resistance. the indon must have learnt from SunTzu.</p>
              <p>When they attack and sink your ship, and they know you won't

              <p>This is just like the situation between China and Taiwan. Taiwan is dependent on China, but not vice versa.</p>
              <p>China has the option of both attacking and retaliation when attacked.</p>
              <p>Taiwan can only afford to retaliate after an attack. If it attacks, it will lose its weapon source, loses its economic ties, and becomes weaker militarily and economically.</p>
              <p>It does not attack, <strong>because it cannot afford to.</strong></p>
              <p><strong>Same for indonesia,</strong> if it attacks Spore, there will be confirmed loss of equipment due to damage. and worst of all, the resulting arms embargoes will ensure that these lost equipments will not be replaced, thus weakening the defence of the entire archipelago.

              <p>What a dilemma. Indon has been nice to us because the economy has been doing well. If this continues for some time, they might afford the means to buildup. Luckily corruption will save the day for us.</p>
              <p>Also, their economy is primitive and can go on without foreign investment. While Indon may be starved of arms, Singapore's arms must pass airspace and sea choke points that Indon will try to interdict from bases on its huge landmass.</p>

              <p>No sure how an RSN could be sunk in Indon territorial water, but if there is no provocation, fire without warning, RSN ship taken by surprise...and all data shows that indon's attack is intentional, our only response is to strike back at the vessels or aircraft, selective strikes if you want to call it.</p>
              <p>We will issue warning that any further hostile action will be dealt with decisively, and our initial action must prove that we can do it, and we are prepared to do it.</p>

              U guys dun know modern warfare, huh? as of rit now the reason singapore has such a huge military budget is to fund SE asia's largest navy and airforce, not to mention most technologically sophisticated army. Now its not abt manpower anymore. sure singapore's army is puny, but the only reason our neighbours still bother to look us in the eye and say yes to mutual exxistence is because of the fact that we have the strongest army in the whole of SE Asia. dun get things wrong. as it is Singapore has the capability to wipe out the 'navy' and airforce of malaysia in a matter of days. with no air and naval support, who do u think has the upper hand.
                 
              look at the gulf war. THAT war showed us even if Saddam had the world's third largets army at that time swarmed around the puny UN forces, a simple series of airstrikes wiped out saddam's supply routes, his airforces, his navy. His troops were crushed in a matter of weeks.
              
              You guys complain all day long abt how over-exagerated the milt budget is, but really, u look at things, Indoesia clearly doesnt like us, malaysia sees us as a threat, and the only reason malaysia still honours her water agreement was because of the very vocal threat that the minute malaysia cancelled her contract, Singapore would invade. NOW WHY would u think malaysia, especially our dear mahatair listen to that, if not for the REAL fact that singapore's armed forces DO pose a direct and strong threat to Malaysia?

              <p>1) They do anything more beyond waving their fist and they will grow hungry for years. Singapore is an economic imperialist in the region if you haven realise. Malaysia is financially healthier than indon, but still cannot survive without Singapore. we form the bulk of investment in M'sia and Indo.</p>
              <p>In the event that anything happens, we can and we will instantly pull the plug. Factories will be shutted down immediately, and these people will lose their jobs. Additional unemployment will only give these government headaches, since unemployment is always a big issue in these countries.</p>
              <p>2)Air drop. are you joking?</p>
              <p>Back in the 1950s it is still possible, with our military being backwards and primitive.</p>
              <p>Today, our radar, civilian and military, would have plucked you out from miles away.</p>
              <p>Missiles, fighters might still be able to get past our defence. But troop-carrying aircraft? They are slow, and theres 600miles to travel. and they have few functional military planes. they are just sitting ducks to be shot down if they even try.</p>
              <p>and Tuas and Lim Chu Kang are another joke right?</p>
              <p>One is a heavily guarded naval base, and the 2nd is exercise grounds of the SAF, and home to a couple of camps, and is of relative unimportance as a KINs. they can capture and sabotage lim chu kang for all we care, until we wipe them out.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>This is just like the situation between China and Taiwan. Taiwan is dependent on China, but not vice versa.</p>
              <p>China has the option of both attacking and retaliation when attacked.</p>
              <p>Taiwan can only afford to retaliate after an attack. If it attacks, it will lose its weapon source, loses its economic ties, and becomes weaker militarily and economically.</p>
              <p>It does not attack, <strong>because it cannot afford to.</strong></p>
              <p><strong>Same for indonesia,</strong> if it attacks Spore, there will be confirmed loss of equipment due to damage. and worst of all, the resulting arms embargoes will ensure that these lost equipments will not be replaced, thus weakening the defence of the entire archipelago. I think countries like Papua New Guinea would seize the chance of procuring the entire island, instead of the present half it owns. Not to mention China, who will occupy wherever that is resource-rich.</p>

              <p>I don't think Indon is that much dependent on Singapore. In a war, both sides suffer and we have to make sure that they suffer a lot more than we do.</p>
              <p>In the unlikely event that there is an uprising due to poverty (especially when indon is a large country with very uneven distribution of wealth), or support for extremists (religious...) and the government of indonesia disintegrate,  power taken over by rogue generals, then there may be a possibility of distraction, or diverting attention on domestic problem to spore.  When there happen, there is no logical consideration.</p>

              exactly. indonesia as of now does not have the economic and military capability to wage a war. Singapore, on the other hand, does, but probably wont do so.

              duh? like i said, Singapore has the largest military budget in SE asia, plus the strongest, largest, most sophisticated airforce and navy in SE asia. Indonesia is still using ww2 era ships and plane. go figure.

              Right now, Singapore can and already has an active invasion plan to invade and defeat Malaysia in less than four months. It can be done, and really, it is this very trump card that LKY waved in front of Mahatair when he made that vocal threat that if the day ever came when Malaysia cancelled, the water agreement, Singapore WILL invade. now ask urselves this: SO WHY to this day malaysia still honours that agreement?
                      
                      
              
              
              Even WW2 already showed that technology overrules manpower. Hitler sent in a few men, the most advanced armoured divisions and in a three pronged pincer movement, wiped out the polish army, airforce and navy in less than two months. flat. within two months hitler used his armoured  divisions to swarm over the whole of poland. Why? poland had no tanks, mere biplanes numbering in tens against hitler's luftwaffe( over thousands of planes) and hell, their troops were still using pikes and muskets and ancient rifles.

              <p>When that happened, occupy the Riau Archepelago and bomb JKT from there. Indonesia will also be in a state of war. When countries are at war, nothing will continue as normal. When the american fought war in vietnam, their life was not normal when they see the body bags coming back.</p>
              <p>Spore knows it has no land to fight a war, it cannot have an exended military campaign, its economy would come to a standstill in an all out war, it will take much longer time for an economic recovery following a war, even if it wins ....the question is not what can we do, but what should we do.</p>
