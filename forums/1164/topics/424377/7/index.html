              <p>Precisely, Singapore cannot have a prolonged military campaign, so the war must be chop chop, whereas Indonesia need only maintain the aggression.</p>
              <p>And also the body bags, this will be something new to Singaporeans. Where as the Americans and Indonesians have their service personnel killed in the line of duty all along, for Singapore would there be acceptance for a steady stream of KIAs coming in?</p>

              <p>Malacca Straits is international waters and is important not only to Singapore, but more so to Japan, China and others, and thus malaysia and indon. If the free flow of traffic through Malacca Straits is threatened by conflict among indon, malaysian and spore, with the money from china, japan and their partners in the middle east, kra canal becomes a viable option.</p>

              <p>We saw this situation in the Persian Gulf when USA was an ally of Iraq. USA asked all tankers sailing from Iraq to fly the US flag. USA protected the tankers from the Iranians.</p>
              <p>Of course Indon will allow Chinese or Japanese- flagged tankers to pass, but if they dock in Singapore, they will be fired on. Hence if Singapore wants oil, it will have to come from Malaysia or Brunei.</p>

              dun nid much will-power. conventional warfare now all technological. once Singapore's airforce and navy are finshed with indonesia and its ww2 era crap of a navy and airforce, i doubt there's ANY air or sea support left for teh indo army. simple. think gulf war. the troops did minimal fighting. within a few weeks, the world's most sophisticated airforce of the US literally crushed the million-strong armies of saddam without the UN troops lifting much of a finger. once supply lines and support are cut from above, the troops on the ground are essentially dead. THAT is modern warfare, not the ww2 era of manpower= win. 
              
              WW2: Hitler went into russia with ten times less troops and conquered close to HALF of russia . think about that.

              <p>We have anti terrorists unit to fight the terrorists. Our reservists are not trained to fight terrorists.</p>
              <p>Let the uniform group fight against the uniform group, and those who dont come in uniform be countered by people who are not in uniform. Do you wear uniform?</p>

              <p>We saw this situation in the Persian Gulf when USA was an ally of Iraq. USA asked all tankers sailing from Iraq to fly the US flag. USA protected the tankers from the Iranians.</p>
              <p>Of course Indon will allow Chinese or Japanese- flagged tankers to pass, but if they dock in Singapore, they will be fired on. Hence if Singapore wants oil, it will have to come from Malaysia or Brunei.</p>
              <p>Aside from keeping Malaysia on our side, if anyone has a solution to this problem please voice it here.</p>

              <p>The solution is to keep Indon and Malaysia both on our sides, or at least one of them on our side. If not possible, keep them on the neutral side, if they choose to stand on the side that is against us, then make it very very clear to them that they will suffer many many times more if they take stupid military action.</p>
              <p>How will they fire on the tankers docked in Singapore? why don't they simply fire at the Chinese and Japanese ships along the Malacca Straits, to prevent them from coming to dock at Singapore? What do you think would be the reaction of the chinese and the japanese if their tankers were fired upon?</p>
