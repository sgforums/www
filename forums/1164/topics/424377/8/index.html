              <p>first of all, malaysia would never have the balls to stand up against indonesia, much less for our sake. should malaysia even dare to look indonesia in the eye during a singapore indonesia conflict, they can kiss their entire east malaysia bye bye.</p>
              <p>all the SLOC are international water, the global powers will never stand idle if indonesia seeks to dominate/threaten/control the SLOC that is critical to the survival of the entire east asian nations.</p>
              <p>if indonesia so much as show that it seeks to control the SLOC, it runs the risk of being broken up into a dozen nations by superpowers covertly or overtly. its so easy nowadays to label any nation a terrorist state, and start the bombing runs.</p>

              <p>if shits really hits the fan and we goes to war with indonesia, i will rather have australia, thailand and china on our side. at the very least, the above 3 nations will hate to see a stronger, assertive and domination indonesia for their own nation interest.</p>
              <p>with thailand, malaysia will think thrice before they even dream of backstabbing us, we could even drop afew bombs in KL to make sure they get the message.</p>
              <p>with australia, america wont be far behind, and with or without NATO participation, indonesia is effective kaput.</p>
              <p>china will most definitely try to let america do the dirty job, but china aint no fools as they will be more severely impacted by an indonesia that seeks to control all of china and east asian economic and oil shipping lines.</p>
              <p>malaysia can sit this one out, they will probably be too busy looking for their missing fighter jet engine and keeping their ships afloat from leaking. War aint something malaysia can handle, they only got 48 tanks, indonesia will die laughing.</p>

              <p>If Sg and Msia need each other, join forces under FPDA, we're in luck. They are in a better position to supply ground forces while we supply air and sea components (air support, strike, UAV and manned reconnaissance, sealift, sea control) so our men can go back to work and earn money for this war. Tell Msia, "look, you know yourself it's not going to work the other way around."</p>

              <p>why would FPDA ignore 2/3 of malaysia's territory must give you pause as to the REAL reason why FPDA existed, and i can assure you its certainly not out of love for malaysia.</p>
              <p>despite malaysia's repeated attempt to expand the FPDA to cover its east malaysian territories, it was repeatedly denied by all the other participants, so honestly... even malaysia have no illusion about the FPDA and the "security" it provides.</p>

              and i seriously doubt UK-AUZ-NZ consider malaysia any better then
              indonesia.</p>
              <p>the BARE FACT that FPDA does NOT include east malaysia should be
              clear to you that non of the UK-AUZ-NZ powers are really interested
              in defending malaysia.</p>
              <p>why would FPDA ignore 2/3 of malaysia's territory must give you
              pause as to the REAL reason why FPDA existed, and i can assure you
              its certainly not out of love for malaysia.</p>
              <p>despite malaysia's repeated attempt to expand the FPDA to cover
              its east malaysian territories, it was repeatedly denied by all the
              other participants, so honestly... even malaysia have no illusion
              about the FPDA and the "security" it provides.</p>

              <p>You've done your googling and seen it a thousand times: FPDA counters Indonesia.</p>
              <p>You're just denying
                                  it here because you were stupidly advocating to bomb Malaysia and forgo any FPDA assistance.
                                  If you insist, let's see...</p>
              <ul>
              <li>The British Labour government announced in 1967 its new policy of military
                                  withdrawal East of Suez. Originally expected for the mid-1970s, the military
                                  disengagement was eventually moved to the end of 1971. This decision surprised Malaysia and Singapore,
                                  as they were dependent on their military ties with London. Modifying the decision taken by the
                                  previous Labour government, the new Conservative government decided to maintain
                                  some military engagement in the region by proposing to supersede the 1957 AMDA
                                  by a "loose consultative political framework". Consequently, the
                                  defence ministers of Australia,
                                  Malaysia, New Zealand, Singapore
                                  and the United Kingdom
                                  concluded the formation of the FPDA in London
                                  on 16 April 1971.</li>
              </ul>
              <ul>
              <li>East Malaysia was excluded from the ambit of the agreement as Australia wanted to prevent getting involved in
                                  territorial disputes with the Philippines
                                  and Indonesia over the island of Borneo. The exclusion of East Malaysia
                                  remains relevant today, as it implies that the FPDA could not be called upon in
                                  the case of a military clash between Kuala Lumpur
                                  and Beijing over the Spratly
                                  Islands in the South
                                   China Sea.</li>
              </ul>
              <ul>
              <li>Besides tense bilateral relations between Singapore
                                  and Malaysia, the formation
                                  of the FPDA followed the Indonesia
                                  opposition to the formation of the Federation of Malaysia in 1963. Viewed as a
                                  British neo-colonial design, Sukarno had started a campaign of Confrontation to
                                  oppose the new federation. While the downfall of Sukarno in 1965 and the
                                  establishment of ASEAN in August 1967 had symbolized the end of the period of
                                  Confrontation, regional relations continued to be characterized by mistrust and
                                  sources of tension. Despite the political reconciliation between Kuala Lumpur and Jakarta, Malaysia remained fearful of Indonesia.
                                  Likewise, Singapore had suffered
                                  attacks during the period of Confrontation and mistrusted Jakarta. Indonesia's
                                  annexation of East Timor in December 1975 was
                                  another issue that complicated Singapore-Indonesian relations. The city-state
                                  was, in 1975, still fearful of Jakarta's
                                  regional intentions and potential hegemonic ambitions. Indonesia and
                                  its potential regional aspirations were therefore a clear referent of the FPDA during
                                  the 1970s and 1980s. Jakarta
                                  would, for many years, remain sceptical about the arrangements. Jakarta saw the FPDA as inappropriate as it represented an
                                  "insurance against Indonesia's
                                  possible reversion to her old ways". President Suharto particularly
                                  objected to its possible expansion in membership to include Brunei. As late
                                  as 1990, the former Indonesian foreign minister, Mochtar Kusmaatmdja, called
                                  for the FPDA to be disbanded and replaced by a trilateral defence relationship
                                  between Indonesia, Malaysia and Singapore. Indonesia gradually softened its approach,
                                  however, and the former Defence Minister General Benny Murdani eventually
                                  declared in 1994 that "if the FPDA makes its members feel secure, then
                                  regional security is enhanced and Indonesia is happy".</li>

              malaysia's puny ass aganst indoneisa... *double ouch*... and we
              wonder WHICH IDIOT went around blabbering FPDA was formed to deal
              with indonesia.... haahahaha...<br> <strong><br> If Malaysia, Australia and Philippines are on the same team, why
              should Australia allow Malaysia to invoke FPDA in a dispute with
              the Philippines? Nevertheless Australia sees fit defend West
              Malaysia- how come?</strong><br> <br> and in the last part, by 1994 even indonesia dont regard FPDA as
              directing against it... you trying to make us laugh our ass off
              isit?<br> <br> <strong>If you take Jakarta's comments to mean</strong> <strong>that Indonesia has no objection to the FPDA, and is not
              trying to save face since it can't do anything about it, let it
              be.</strong><br> <br> for your information, you might wanna read the british govt THE
              DEFENCE REVIEW 1966... there you will realize that the brits by
              then were not concern about indonesia hitting singapore, they were
              there to (put it bluntly) to defend singapore against malaysia....

              <p>dont humour me... Jakarta aint as dumb as you think, the fact the FPDA is OFFICIALLY a LOOSELY CONSULTATIVE POLITICAL FRAMEWORK and its exclusion of EAST malaysia under the FPDA framework should be clear indication of the FACT of our desire not to form a military alliance against anyone, therefore FPDA sure as hell is not a military alliance with indonesia as the target!</p>
              <p>only problem is that you have been dreaming so long in LALA land, you are in self denial of the critical reality.</p>

              <p>and your purpose in stating an unrelated point is? dont try to fudge the issue with irrelevant quotes. the brits for all intent obviously would like to withdraw its troops from malaysia since the indonesian konfrontasi is at an end....</p>
              <p>but the undenialable fact of the matter is, by 1966 the brits were more concerned over a potential conflict between singapore and malaysia eversince singapore was separated from malaysia in less then friendly situation.</p>
              <p>it was well known back then, tunku abdul rahman told the brits his intention to force singapore to toe malaysia's line by threatening to turn off the water tap. and in LKY latest memoir, he spoke of the fact that even though he was the PM of an independent singapore, in the begining he was literary place under malaysian army "guard" and his daily schedule such as cabinet meeting are being dictated by KL until the brits came to save his ass.</p>
              <p>furthermore, its a well known fact then, that the british army presence in singapore was the only thing that ensured singapore's independence and prevented LKY chestnut from being roasted over the KL bonfire.</p>

              <p>as i said, the purpose is to put a leash over malaysia, what better way is there to keep malaysia under the leash then to have malaysia become part of the "consultative body"?? just use your brain and think lah... if you still have any left.</p>
              <p>were a 4PDA form just to protect singapore, malaysia would go amok and went on a emotional rampage and slam their heads into the wall, smokes will come out right from their ass, how is that gonna be beneficial to singapore security or keeping malaysia under leash?? hahahaaaa....</p>

Singapore doesnt NEED the west. with our own forces we can easily bomb the shit out of malaysia. mind you, SIngapore CAN invade and conquer malaysia, we HAVE the money, we HAVE the pre-emptive strike plans all done, we HAVE the power to do so. 
              
              ASK yourselves this: to this very day, malaysia honours a watr agreement which it is running at a LOSS. WHY? because there was a time when LKY once told mahatair: if you ever cut off the water to singapore, we WILL invade, and you WILL lose. 
              
              Here's some stats: singapore currently has the largest military budget in the whole of SE asia. PLUS, the strongest and largest navy and airforce in the whole of SE asia. PLUS, the second strongest economy in the whole of SE asia, losing to indonesia only in size, but not in stability and strength.
              
              When war breaks out, the nation whose economy can withstand a war and can strike first with the strongest air support wins. simple.
              
              bomb the shit out of KL? we dun nid the west for that. we got our own flyboys at the SAF to do that for us in a heart beat. 
              
              You guys complain so much abt the so-called 'inflated' military budget of singapore, but let me remind, indonesia and malaysia ARE NOT OUR FRIENDS. the ONLY trump card we have over them is deterrence. go ask ur parents or yourselves. rmb the day indonesia landed paratroopers on our first national day? malaysia and indo joining together to wipe out the little fledgling called singapore?
