              <p><span style="color: #333333;"><strong>Who
              called FPDA a military alliance? Britain withdrew permanent forces
              for cost reasons and deliberately did not make FPDA a binding
              agreement. Are you stupid? Where did I say FPDA is a military
              alliance?</strong></span></p>
              <p>guess wat... who is the one that has been YELLING protection
              under the FPDA, join forces under the FPDA, and that nonsense that
              FPDA was aim at indonesia,  read your own post again from the
              top of this page.</p>
              <p><span style="color: #333333;"><strong>If
              Malaysia, Australia and Philippines are on the same team, why
              should Australia allow Malaysia to invoke FPDA in a dispute with
              the Philippines? Nevertheless Australia sees fit defend West
              Malaysia- how come?</strong></span></p>
              <p>nonsense!! not to mention the FACT that there is NO clause under
              FPDA for malaysia to invoke in its dispute against phillipine, need
              i remind you that philipine has USA backing, or do you think
              australia is gonna take on USA+phillipine for malaysia's butt sake?
              hahahaaa </p>
              <p><span style="color: #333333;"><strong>If
              you take Jakarta's comments to mean</strong> <strong>that
              Indonesia has no objection to the FPDA, and is not trying to save
              face since it can't do anything about it, let it
              be.</strong></span></p>
              <p>dont humour me... Jakarta aint as dumb as you think, the fact
              the FPDA is OFFICIALLY a LOOSELY CONSULTATIVE POLITICAL FRAMEWORK
              and its exclusion of EAST malaysia under the FPDA framework should
              be clear indication of the FACT of our desire not to form a
              military alliance against anyone, therefore FPDA sure as hell is
              not a military alliance with indonesia as the target!</p>
              <p>only problem is that you have been dreaming so long in LALA
              land, you are in self denial of the critical reality.</p>
              <p><span style="color: #333333;"><strong>"The
              White Paper announced an intention to stay in Singapore under
              "acceptable conditions," as long as the Governments of Singapore
              and Malaysia want them to. Hopes are expressed that an end to the
              confrontation between Indonesia and Malaysia may enable Britain to
              withdraw some of 40,000 now stationed in
              Malaysia.</strong></span></p>
              <p>and your purpose in stating an unrelated point is? dont try to
              fudge the issue with irrelevant quotes. the brits for all intent
              obviously would like to withdraw its troops from malaysia since the
              indonesian konfrontasi is at an end....</p>
              <p>but the undenialable fact of the matter is, by 1966 the brits
              were more concerned over a potential conflict between singapore and
              malaysia eversince singapore was separated from malaysia in less
              then friendly situation.</p>
              <p>it was well known back then, tunku abdul rahman told the brits
              his intention to force singapore to toe malaysia's line by
              threatening to turn off the water tap. and in LKY latest memoir, he
              spoke of the fact that even though he was the PM of an independent
              singapore, in the begining he was literary place under malaysian
              army "guard" and his daily schedule such as cabinet meeting are
              being dictated by KL until the brits came to save his ass.</p>
              <p>furthermore, its a well known fact then, that the british army
              presence in singapore was the only thing that ensured singapore's
              independence and prevented LKY chestnut from being roasted over the
              KL bonfire.</p>
              <p><span style="color: #333333;"><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"> Now you are claiming FPDA is meant to contain
              Malaysia.</span> Lagi best! Why not 4PDA to protect Singapore
              only?</strong><br></span></p>
              <p>as i said, the purpose is to put a leash over malaysia, what
              better way is there to keep malaysia under the leash then to have
              malaysia become part of the "consultative body"?? just use your
              brain and think lah... if you still have any left.</p>
              <p>were a 4PDA form just to protect singapore, malaysia would go
              amok and went on a emotional rampage and slam their heads into the
              wall, smokes will come out right from their ass, how is that gonna
              be beneficial to singapore security or keeping malaysia under
              leash?? hahahaaaa....</p>
              <p><span style="color: #333333;"><strong>And
              it's funny you would rather trust Indonesia than trust Malaysia in
              war. Yeah, the US would've put an arms embargo on Msia, not
              Indonesia if you were right.</strong></span></p>
              <p>and you think that  US who put an arms ambargo on indonesia
              would not dare to do the same to malaysia should malaysia fail to
              bend over every american demand????</p>
              <p>you must be smoking with your ear... haahahaaa..... or you
              really think for one second that US fears malaysia more then they
              fear indonesia??? hahahahahaaa.......</p>
              <p><span style="color: #333333;"><strong>Pure
              cock and bull. You mean the Mal-Indo declaration of the end of
              Konfrontasi on 28 May 1966? Sukarno started Kon against Malaysia in
              1962, not Singapore which was not independent. In any case, "Formal
              relations between Singapore and Indonesia began with the
              establishment of a Singapore Liaison Office in December 1966. 
              Both countries agreed to establish formal diplomatic relations at
              Ambassadorial level from 7 September 1967. (quote Sg
              govt)</strong>"</span></p>
              <p>yeah... LKY is cock and bull, because he wrote that in his
              memoir, that he found out about the end of konfrontasi from the
              newspaper, and suddenly realised that now konfrontasi is between
              singapore and indonesia only, malaysia has conviently abandoned us
              and negotiated a settlement with indonesia without us.</p>
              <p>lucky for us, indonesia suharto was willing to live and let
              live... or we would be truely in a bind, thanks to malaysia.</p>

              <p>Yeah... You think Australia won't support Malaysia in a territorial dispute with Philippines, because it would incur USA's wrath? And the Tunku kicked Singapore out because he wanted to invade it later?</p>
              <p>You are getting better and better. Let's continue this and see what further wisdom you have in store! You're in this mess all because you committed yourself hopelessly to maintaining that the FPDA isn't directed at Indonesia, or better yet, at Malaysia instead.</p>

              All right, who was the "genius" who unlocked this thread? :P
              
              And the idiot who uses a nuke on Singapore deserves to get half the world pissed off at him. Maybe more than half, Malaysia and Indonesia would be majorly pissed off, and the rest won't be too happy when the abovementioned idiot irradiates the only resonable major shipping lane between east and west. The other possible route is through the Straits of Bencoolan through Indonesia, and playing "dodge the islands" through there with a supertanker is no joke.

              But big problem is that Singapore is a chokepoint, we're the only 1 of 2 routes connecting East and West (Well, 3 if you went through the Atlantic), half the world's oil passes through/by us. Imagine how much you can charge for toll. Oh sorry, Indonesians call it "processing fee".
              
              And we're the only non-muslim country in the huge chunk of "Greenland", the indo-extremists have been calling for an Islam caliphnate since independence, sore spot in their eye.
              
              And their accusations of us harbouring their "corrupt businessmen", especially those fleeing the Jakata anti-chinese riots are designed to turn their population against us and away from their government.
              
              So I'd say it's not totally impossible, just not very likely at the moment, but who knows in the future?
              
              Hope not though, the loss of life on both sides have the potential to be very high.
