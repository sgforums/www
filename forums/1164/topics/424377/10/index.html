              <p>But big problem is that Singapore is a chokepoint, we’re the only 1 of 2 routes connecting East and West (Well, 3 if you went through the Atlantic), half the world’s oil passes through/by us. Imagine how much you can charge for toll. Oh sorry, Indonesians call it “processing fee”.</p>
              <p>And we’re the only non-muslim country in the huge chunk of “Greenland”, the indo-extremists have been calling for an Islam caliphnate since independence, sore spot in their eye.</p>
              <p>And their accusations of us harbouring their “corrupt businessmen”, especially those fleeing the Jakata anti-chinese riots are designed to turn their population against us and away from their government.</p>

              I spoke to one of my friends who was an OCS instructor before, and he mentioned something very interesting I never knew. Arty is very hard to use against targets in Singapore because of the buildings. It's like shooting through a picket fence, the guy close to the fence can aim between the gaps, while the other guy has to be either very lucky or skilled to slip a round in just right to pass between the buildings and hit the target. More likely to hit the building instead. 
              
              Of course, to counter this, they can send the round high like a howitzer, but the higher the angle needed, the less range the piece has, so artillery fire from Singapore is actually more effective than fire coming into Singapore.

              <p>It should be no problem to engage targets in camps. If enemy arty has problems engaging our units, I hope it's units on the march that happen to be passing through an estate, not some mobilized units that we chose to place in between residential blocks. That would be some diabolical shit.</p>

            <div class='col-md body'>I'd pity the marching units, without cover against arty, they'll take losses. OTOH, our own arty would be free from harassment and can do a countershoot. Actually what I meant was not to hide mobile units between buildings, but our own artillery, something like 2 gunmen but one hiding behind protection, the other without.</div>

              <p>Hopefully SAF realises there are enough "clean" locations for units to shoot and scoot from, so it's not necessary to use such unorthodox shields. Imagine the impact on your morale to know your fellow soldiers may be using your house for cover. Besides losing your home, you will have to pay top dollar for one that a govt will certainly rebuild smaller.</p>
              <p>I'm sure the buildings compound problems with reconnaisance and laser guided air strikes as well.</p>

              Honestly speaking and probably for others too, I'd rather any arty round hit a building rather than people, even if it's my own home. 
                  
              If friendly arty survives to help you pound your objective so that you can walk in, vs having to do an assault into fortified areas, it might just save my life. In that case, I'd be wishing all arty rounds hit my home instead. Home can be rebuild, hard to reattach your arms, legs or head. :(
