              <p>1. Indon sinking our ship is just like NK sinking ROK's ship. You can ask for justice and Indon will say come and get it, it's a big loss of face. It's easier for Sg to compensate its own servicemen and call it an accident. Furthermore politicians there are very good at turning ANYTHING into anti-Singapore sentiment.</p>
              <p>2. If WE blew up a village, we should of course make restitution along the line of "we killed Indon citizens and we recognize the authority of the Indon govt to distribute the compensation" so they can dip their hands into it. Imagine if we paid 10X the sum directly, the politician would attack us for paying too little, say we are bullying poor villagers, don't respect human life blah blah...</p>

              <p>For No.1. I don't think there would be compensation to the servicemen families. As I have said this is during hostilities, and if a war situation is declared, then there is no compensation payable. After the emergency, a token amount maybe payable, this is for vote winning. Emergency/war time casualties would not be taken as a peace time accident.</p>
              <p>No.2 is a thought. Pay the Indon government so that the officials can skim from the top and whats left is filtered down. And alls well.</p>

              <p>Yup. That's why when indon maids murder their employers, we pragmatically declare them insane and send them back.</p>
              <p>I can foresee if a ship is sunk with 50 sailors dead, people here will be baying for blood. But our govt probably won't hiu them. This govt only knows to come up with some lame excuses nobody believes.</p>

              <p>The Qing govt indeed got cut to pieces because it was weak. But also because it tried to act strong even when it had no strength to act, it only furthered the process of being cut up.</p>
              <p>Massacring foreigners, whether right or wrong, provoked further invasion. Refusing to consider British strength when the Brits offered to a lease a trading post, whether a fair or unfair offer, provoked a British invasion. Japan's first contact with China was over Taiwan, began when China treated Japan with disdain.</p>

              <p>We hanged philippino maid, we hanged vietnamese drugs peddlers, we have also convicted a malaysian drugs peddlers to death, now pending appeal to the president, we canned the american kids even when clinton pleaded, which indonesian maids that deserved to be hanged but got off free ?</p>
              <p>if a RSN ship were sunk and you believe we will not do anything? I don't share the same belief.</p>
              <p>Right or wrong, fair or unfair, is a very important critiria in deciding if the actions are justified. If you think a weak nation deserved to be cut into pieces, then we are not talking world of civilization, but a rule of the law of the jungle, or babarians in sheep cloth.</p>
              <p>Beware, china is very strong now, and relatively there are many weak nations near and far.....they want trading posts, they want natural gas, they want to be heard, ....lan lan the whole world now start to learn mandarin.</p>
              <p>Today is the centennial anniversary of the uprising that led to the toppling of Qing dynasty. It is most appropriate to bring up how a weak country, even with vast land and population, can be bullied by a strong country from thousands of miles away.  The lesson learnt from the modern chinese history is that when a government is weak and allow foreigners to bully them, the people will rise up against them. when under foreign invasion, the people, both communists and nationalists would join force and fight against the japanese, any chinese, communist or nationalist, who help the japs, are considered traitors, æ±‰å¥¸.</p>

              <p>1) Why would Indo ever want to wage war on Singapore?</p>
              <p>2) By what means could they invade Singapore?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>a) they don't need more land, with so much land lying around being unproductive back home.</p>
              <p>b) Singapore has no resources. All wealth is digital, and can be transferred out of the country in seconds.</p>
              <p>c) Singapore is swarming with Chinese, christians etc. I don't think Indo would want to add more of this people into their population. It already has enough problem dealing with chinese and christian issues back home.</p>
              <p>d) Can they afford to fight a war? War need money you know.</p>
              <p>e) Do they have the means to sustain an invasion? Do you expect to send thousands of troops by sampans? or fly by garuda airline? Last i heard, they lack troop carriers, ships and planes.</p>
              <p>f) What do they gain from fighting with singapore? we are one of their biggest investors. Bite the hand that feed you, and you will starve.</p>
              <p>g) Singapore mostly import from indo. we can easily change our supplier. on the other hand, it is harder for indo to find a new customer.</p>
              <p>h) how long can they sustain an unpopular war? When the US wage war, they can bomb its enemy 24/7, with its factories churning out an unlimited supply of ammunition.</p>
              <p>Indo is still a weapon importer. It can launch all the missiles and bombs it wishes. but once they run out, there will be no one to sell new supplies. and its very likely to be subjected to an arms embargo.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Conclusion: For small developing countries, war is a luxury, fought only when you have very powerful backers, or if both countries are of little worth to the world.</p>

                      I don't share the same belief.</p>
              <p>Right or wrong, fair or unfair, is a very important critiria in
                      deciding if the actions are justified. If you think a weak nation
                      deserved to be cut into pieces, then we are not talking world of
                      civilization, but a rule of the law of the jungle, or
                      babarians in sheep cloth.</p>
              <p>Beware, china is very strong now, and relatively there are many
                      weak nations near and far.....they want trading posts, they want
                      natural gas, they want to be heard, ....lan lan the whole world now

              <p>Today is the centennial anniversary of the uprising that led to
                      the toppling of Qing dynasty. It is most appropriate to bring up
                      how a weak country, even with vast land and population, can be
                      bullied by a strong country from thousands of miles away.  The
                      lesson learnt from the modern chinese history is that when a
                      government is weak and allow foreigners to bully them, the people
                      will rise up against them. when under foreign invasion, the people,
                      both communists and nationalists would join force and fight against
                      the japanese, any chinese, communist or nationalist,
                      who help the japs, are considered traitors, æ±‰å¥¸.</p>

              <p>Singapore has often made punches well above its weight and size. There is not much to refute. do you think hanging a few poor indonesian maids will really make singapore stand tall as a sovereign country? I rather believe in what the doctors said about the ill mental health of these poor village girls.  </p>
              <p>When your warship got sunk, you compensate your own servicemen and call it an accident, that is a weak course of action, to put it very mildly, to put it more appropriately, your balls shrink, the fact is, it is an act with no balls! today, even the phililppines, with its pathetic navy, would not "compensate its own servicement and call it an accident" if their warship got sunk by the Chinese.</p>
              <p>"Knowing the limits of its power" is not an excuse to bow down to foreign power!! If indonesia is a power you need to bow, you should first bow to the abang up north, and you will never see light, for your head will forever be bowed.</p>
              <p>What political action can possibly be effective against a rogue general?  how to demonstrate SAF's ability if you cannot use it, or worse, your ship got sunk and you call it accident?</p>
              <p>The purpose of a strong SAF is to ensure a strong deterrence. For a strong deterrence to be effective, we not only need the SAF to be strong, we must show that we are prepared to use it.</p>

              <p>Singapore has often made punches well above its weight and size.
                  There is not much to refute. do you think hanging a few poor
                  indonesian maids will really make singapore stand tall as a
                  sovereign country? I rather believe in what the doctors said about
                  the ill mental health of these poor village girls.  </p>
              <p>When your warship got sunk, you compensate your own
                  servicemen and call it an accident, that is a weak course
                  of action, to put it very mildly, to put it more
                  appropriately, your balls shrink, the fact is, it is an act
                  with no balls! today, even the phililppines, with its pathetic
                  navy, would not "compensate its own servicement and call it an
                  accident" if their warship got sunk by the Chinese.</p>
              <p>"Knowing the limits of its power" is not an excuse
                  to bow down to foreign power!! If indonesia is a power
                  you need to bow, you should first bow to the abang up north, and
                  you will never see light, for your head will forever be bowed.</p>
              <p>What political action can possibly be effective
                  against a rogue general?  how to demonstrate SAF's
                  ability if you cannot use it, or worse, your ship got sunk and you
                  call it accident?</p>
              <p>The purpose of a strong SAF is to ensure a strong deterrence.
                  For a strong deterrence to be effective, we not only need the SAF
                  to be strong, we must show that we are prepared to use it.</p>

              <p>You can quote from Sun Tzu, but you need to know how to apply.</p>
              <p>You want to subdue your enemy without fighting - but when your enemy sinks your ship, and you dare not resist,  you are subdued already, and it is they who have broken your resistance. the indon must have learnt from SunTzu.</p>
              <p>When they attack and sink your ship, and they know you won't fight back, they've already won.</p>
              <p>The thread only asked for the outcome, didn't say anything about why indon want to wage war on us, so I guess what indon get out of it is not important.</p>
              <p>Your answer is clear, when indon wages war on spore, spore willl not fight back.</p>
              <p>My answer is also clear, when indon wages war on spore, spore will strike back.</p>
              <p>Lets hope indon would never wage war on us.</p>

I suggested that Communist jurisdiction has never set foot on Taiwan unlike how KMT jurisdiction once included all China, and as you said, before that it was historically non-Chinese aboriginal land.

              <p>Our understandings of China and its history are very different. I don't know anything about Thailand claiming Kelantan, so can't see the why it is compared to tibet and China.</p>
              <p>To me china today consists of over 34 different kind of people, including the Hans, it is not about colour and language. In fact, the only common thing among these people is the written chinese.</p>
              <p>china is definitely not defined by politics or nationality, are you part of the family?</p>
