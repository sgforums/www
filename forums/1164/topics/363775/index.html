              <p>China's strategy of modernisation of her military seems to have taken on a two prong approach.</p>
              <p>Its planning seem to be improving the technological quality, as well as the quantity of the new technologically advanced equipment.</p>
              <p>Even though China's military technological quality may not be comparable nor equal to that of the US - when based on the level of Chinese military technological achievements that have been established todate - it will still bring China's military quality  a few steps closer to the standards of the US Military when compared to a decade ago.</p>
              <p>To compensate for her lower technological quality, China will depend on quantity to overwhelm whatever technological advantage the US Military may enjoy.</p>
              <p>It is a strategy of using superiority in numbers to overwhelm the technological capabilities of the various high tech military hardware and platforms that the US military can possess.</p>
              <p>It is a strategy borrowed from the past - attacks in wave after wave - this time with equipment and not sacrificing the human life.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>It will be a challenge for the US Military to maintain its technological edge, and find a solution to this concept of "overwhelming quantity vs quality".</p>
              <p>If ever the USA should clash with China - over Taiwan or in the Korean Peninsular - the US Military will have to find a solution to have sufficient manpower, equipment and armaments to sustain the battles against being swamp by the massive waves after waves of China's low tech assault.</p>
              <p>At some point of the battle, in order to prevent itself from being swamped, the US Military will require a sustained and secure resupply of equipment, ammunition, and spares to withstand and carry the battle into China.</p>

              <p><br>China doesn't really need to win in the traditional sense, that of reducing the enermies' numbers to near or exactly 0.</p>
              <p>All it has to do is inflict enough damage that would affect the ability of the US to project its forces in other parts of the world. </p>
              <p>The Chinese do not need to actually have a fleet of comparable strength, just the ability to destroy the carriers. Without the carriers the US pretty much lose the ability to pose any serious threats to the Chinese mainland.</p>
              <p>I don't think the Chinese have the ability to stand toe to toe with the USA fleet, but if the objective is just the carrier i think they do have the capability.</p>
              <p>Of course,all my assumptions are based if the USA's invading China. But personally i doubt the US had the ability to pursue a war on the Chinese mainland, nukes would probably already be used by that point.</p>

              <p>The Chinese do not need to actually have a fleet of comparable strength, just the ability to destroy the carriers. Without the carriers the US pretty much lose the ability to pose any serious threats to the Chinese mainland.</p>
              <p>I don't think the Chinese have the ability to stand toe to toe with the USA fleet, but if the objective is just the carrier i think they do have the capability.</p>
              <p>Of course,all my assumptions are based if the USA's invading China. But personally i doubt the US had the ability to pursue a war on the Chinese mainland, nukes would probably already be used by that point.</p>

              <p><br>That would be difficult i reckon, you may intercept some of them but i doubt the USA could conceivably take out every one of PLA's nuke launch capabilities without compromising the ability of its conventional forces to conduct warfare.</p>
              <p> Too big of an operation, too much possibilities of something going wrong.</p>
              <p>And that is assuming that the PLA is led by complete incompetents, who would not exploit the constant changing stituations which i find doubtful.</p>

              <p>hmmm...don't think the US would take such as risk for Taiwan, probably not even for Japan.</p>
              <p>imagine Chinese making suitcase bomb, and there are thousands of overseas Chinese who are pro PRC, or for that matter, act in the name of Chinese; and what if they just supply the necessary weapons to anybody who are against the US.</p>
              <p>by then you won't be able to blame the north korean for being naughty. If pakistan extremists use the nuclear bombs supplied by china on India, ....hell breaks lose.</p>
              <p>there is no way the US president, with the right mind would ever consider such an option.</p>

              <p>A threat to everyone China is near... They've yet to back down from their 200 nmile restricted EEZ claims.  Nobody's restricting foreign vessels from passage through EEZs nor even requiring them to "seek permission." International Maritime Laws sure doesn't require that... that's something only privileged for territorial waters.  </p>
              <p>On the other hand, the Chinese Navy probably won't pose a "threat" in the present and near future.  They'd be swimming with the fishes if they decide to challenge the USN.  </p>

              <p>China has been encouraging US to sustain USD rates so no issue.</p>

              <p>As to "too many players", that's precisely US strategy. Make China expansion a regional issue rather than a China vs Taiwan/US issue only.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>On the other side, China has been trying to contain the issue. Russian+India border agreements. Signing treaty of amity to allay fears in the Spratleys.</p>
              <p>The key headache, other than Taiwan, is still diaoyu dao with Japan. The diplomatic battlegrounds are Vietnam and Korea. US-Vietnam relations has been on the up. China-Korea relations have been getting cosy. Its interesting to see the competing tactics.</p>
