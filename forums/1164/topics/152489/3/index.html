            <div class='col-md body'><strong>some of the grave consequences of Bush's decision to invade Iraq, for which he and his advisors didn't think through!</strong><br><br><strong>The Los Angeles Times</strong> reports that a greater concern is that 'skills' foreign fighters are learning in Iraq are being exported to their home countries. This is a particular concern for Europe, since early this year US intelligence reported that "Abu Musab Zarqawi, whose network is believed to extend far beyond Iraq, had dispatched teams of battle-hardened operatives to European capitals."<br><br>Iraq has become a superheated, real-world academy for lessons about weapons, urban combat and terrorist trade craft, said Thomas Sanderson of the Washington-based Center for Strategic International Studies [CSIS].<br><br>Extremists in Iraq are "exposed to international networks from around the world," said Sanderson, who has been briefed by German security agencies. "They are returning with bomb-making skills, perhaps stolen explosives, vastly increased knowledge. If they are succeeding in a hostile environment, avoiding ... US Special Forces, then to go back to Europe, my God, it's kid's play."<br><br>---------------------<br><br>Saudi Arabia's foreign minister, Prince Saud al-Faisal said the US ignored warnings the Saudi government gave it about occupying Iraq. Prince al-Faisal also said he fears US policies in Iraq will lead to the country breaking up into Kurdish, Sunni and Shiite parts. He also said that Saudi Arabia is not ready to send an ambassador to Baghdad, because he would become a target for the insurgents. "I doubt he would last a day," al-Faisal said.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Imo, the war cannot be justified, even if Saddam is a 'bad' man. You cannot invade another country simply because you don't like the way it is run.  If that is the case, then it will be justified for eg, for Malaysia to invade Singapore and vice versa. Hell, It would be justifiable for NKorea to nuke the US and every other country that doesn't approve of its practices.<br><br>You cannot lie to parliament or its equivalent so as to garner support for war.<br>Bringing a country to war is one of the most important and grave decision a Leader has to make because it will inevitably involve the taking and destruction of human lives and property on both sides. To resort to lies in order to bring a country to war is one of the most despicable and disgusting act a leader can ever do.<br><br></div>
