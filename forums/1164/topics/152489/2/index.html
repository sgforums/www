UNLESS that country is breaching the sovereignty of another, and the regime is deemed to be the cause of the act of aggression.  Besides, if u pass a resolution calling for regime change for a country, who the hell is gonna abide to that?  Their government won't.  Hence, it is essentially a death sentence for war.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>What has been done is done. There is nothing the rest of us can do but to hope for a better future. The weakness in the UN is to blame. The unstable situations in Middle East contributed to the inevitable war. The lack of OIL and the need to run its vast military units across the world contributes to it. The Sept 11th.  The dream of globalisation and as a world police is also a factor. We must all think of all the facts of WHY n WHY NOT!<br><br>US's intellgence credibility is at stake. Hell the WORLD is at stake! Mujahadeens running around blowing themselves up. I mean what better way to kill them all then to kill themselves in thier own ground. Its like in Star Trek..u dun see no middle eastern  people. Its like they just blew themselves up.<br><br>The thing is what should the UN or US do next time ? Will Nato even have any say.. will ASEAN be an effective military Coalition.. so on n forth.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>The Korean peninsular is in one massive stalemate now. But a lil bit more chia lat than China-Taiwan.  In the case of ROC - PRC, the status quo is desireable, to some extent.  No one is suffering cos of it.<br><br>But in DPRK, the status quo is causing deaths. Ppl are starving amd dissidents sent to concentration camps.  There are reports of DRPK testing Chemical and Biological weapons on dissidents in these facilities, which definitely qualifies as Human Rights Violations.<br><br>I believe there are a lot of ppl who want to see a regime change in DPRK.  At the same time, there are lots who do not want a war. Especially the Koreans who have lived thru the previous one.  That is ONE stalemate.<br><br>Second Stalemate is the nuclear weapons.  Heck, u have to give the North Koreans for having balls and playing the right cards.  They've got the missile technology to hit US assets, bases in the pacific. And yes, they can even hit alaska.  Alaska = Oil.  Alaska contains what is probably the US's oil reserve.  6-13 BILLION barrels of oil if they open up drilling.  That is not a place where the US wants to see become Radioactive.  Other possible targets in the pacific that could hurt the US are the asian oil pipelines.  Oil doesn't only affects the USA, but the whole world.<br><br>Hopefully it doesn't stay this way forever.  Firstly, maybe for some unknown reason, Kim Jong Ill might get kidnapped by aliens or die of mysterious heart attack.  Next leader, his Son may actually be more compassionate, and start working for the welfare of his people.  And we might even see a peaceful reunification of the Koreas.<br><br>If not, it will depend on the US's development of its Anti Ballistic Missile systems.  When the US is cocksure that their system is full proof, they may then actually hold the ace to trump DPRK's king. (no pun intended)  Militarily, the USA, can take on the DPRK.  Especially if its willing to commit 7 carrier battle groups into the pacific.  And with the South Koreans moving their capital further south, we might actually be seeing pre-emptive measures to a 2nd showdown in the Korean peninsular.<br><br>Then again, like in the 2nd Gulfwar, the Korean war never really ended. It has been a "ceasefire" all along.  Its just a matter of breaking the "Ceasefire."</div>
