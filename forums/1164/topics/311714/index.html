              <h1>Betrayal of the Gurkhas: Soldiers denied the right to live here hand medals back</h1>
              <p>Thousands of Gurkha veterans marched on Parliament yesterday where many
              handed back their hard-earned military medals in protest at their
              'betrayal' by Britain.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The renowned Nepalese troops have a proud association with the Army dating back 200 years.</p>
              <p>But they are angry at rules which pay younger veterans the same
              pensions as British-born soldiers while those who retired before 1997
              receive only one sixth as much.</p>
              <p><img style="cursor: -moz-zoom-in;" src="http://img.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2008/03_03/gurkhaDM1903_468x700.jpg" alt="The image “http://img.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2008/03_03/gurkhaDM1903_468x700.jpg” cannot be displayed, because it contains errors." width="373"><em>Protest: Damber Ghaly gave back six medals including his MBE</em></p>
              <p>They are also demanding an end to "immoral discrimination" whereby
              older Gurkha veterans are usually barred from settling in the UK as
              British citizens, despite putting their lives on the line for the Crown
              - and the ease with which many foreign criminals and huge numbers of
              illegal immigrants are able to stay in Britain.</p>
              <p>Fifty retired Gurkhas handed back their coveted Long Service
              and Good Conduct Medals at Westminster to express their disgust at
              their treatment.</p>
              <p>It was a hugely embarrassing spectacle for the Ministry of Defence,
              which relies heavily on Gurkha troops to provide manpower for
              operations in Afghanistan and Iraq.</p>
              <p>Ministers are refusing to change the rules, however, claiming that
              back-dating the more generous pensions would cost hundreds of millions
              of pounds and would be "unaffordable".</p>
              <p>The Army has around 3,500 Gurkha soldiers, all recruited in the
              hills of Nepal where 15,000 hopefuls compete for 230 places each year.</p>
              <p><img src="http://img.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2008/03_03/GurkhasR1903_468x312.jpg" alt="The image “http://img.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2008/03_03/GurkhasR1903_468x312.jpg” cannot be displayed, because it contains errors."><em>Protest: 50 Gurkha pensioners will hand back their precious Long Service and Good Conduct medals to the Government</em></p>
              <p>Famed for their curved Kukri fighting knives and terrifying ferocity in
              battle, the Gurkhas have served alongside British troops around the
              world since 1815 - including recently in the Falklands, the Gulf and
              Afghanistan - winning an unparalleled 26 Victoria Crosses.</p>
              <p>Their motto translates as: "It is better to die than to live a coward."</p>
              <p>A deal dating from India's Independence in 1947 pegged their pay
              and pensions to those of the Indian Army, to reflect the lower cost of
              living in their native Nepal compared to Britain.</p>
              <p>The MoD altered the rules last year after growing pressure, giving
              serving Gurkhas the same pay, conditions and pensions as British-born
              troops - as well as the right to settle in Britain when they leave the
              Army.</p>
              <p>The changes were back-dated, but only to include those who retired
              after 1997, when the Brigade of Gurkhas moved from Hong Kong to the UK.</p>
              <p><img src="http://img.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2008/03_03/CleggPA1903_468x344.jpg" alt="The image “http://img.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2008/03_03/CleggPA1903_468x344.jpg” cannot be displayed, because it contains errors."><em>Lib Dem leader Nick Clegg is calling for an end to the forced deportation of retired Gurkhas</em></p>
              <p>Around 22,000 surviving Gurkhas who retired before that date are furious, and claim the cut-off date is "arbitrary and unfair".</p>
              <p>A typical Gurkha private retired after 22 years with £1,200 a year for
              life - a reasonable sum in Nepal, but a fraction of what their
              modern-day counterparts receive under the new rules.</p>
              <p>They are also pushing for equal rights to settle in Britain.</p>
              <p>Damber Ghaly of the Gurkhas United Front handed back six medals
              yesterday, including his MBE, in support of fellow Gurkhas who have
              fallen foul of the rules.</p>
              <p>The 50-year-old, who served for 28 years, said: "It is very sad and
              emotional but I think it is the only thing we can do. I served in
              Kosovo and Bosnia where I was in charge of my troops.</p>
              <p>"It is not a case of being angry but we feel very disappointed and let down."</p>
              <p>The Gurkhas United Front's secretary Lal Prasad Gurung, who
              served in the Falklands, Hong Kong, Brunei, Kosovo and Bosnia, said:
              "We are the same as the British Army, but we are disparaged in so many
              ways."</p>
              <p>Peter Carroll, a Lib Dem councillor in Folkestone, Kent, where
              many Gurkhas have settled near their old base, said: "The greatest test
              of whether people should be part of a community is if they are prepared
              to die for it - and these people are the bravest of the brave."</p>
              <p>Lib Dem leader Nick Clegg told the crowd of around 2,000
              veterans: "When I told people what you get from the Government in
              return for the years of brave, loyal, uncomplaining success, people
              simply don't believe it.</p>
              <p>"It is quite simply a national disgrace. I will do everything I can to end this unacceptable and immoral discrimination."</p>
              <p>In the Commons later Mr Clegg challenged Gordon Brown on the issue,
              demanding to know why Gurkhas retiring after 1997 were more "worthy" of
              British citizenship.</p>
              <p>The Prime Minister said Gurkhas had served "loyally" in every part of
              the world and the Government had already acted to improve their pay and
              pension rights.</p>
              <p>MoD sources said the Government was concerned that backdating the
              changes to before 1997 would set a dangerous precedent for other
              retrospective pension upgrades.</p>
              <p>The Gurkhas' links with the British Army date back to 1814 when
              British forces fought a fierce war against Nepal, during which the
              adversaries developed a deep mutual respect and admiration.</p>
              <p>Realising they were unlikely ever to defeat the hill warriors, British
              commanders began to recruit them instead. By the time of the Second
              World War the Army had no fewer than 40 Gurkha battalions, with 112,000
              men.</p>
              <p>New recruits are selected each year through a series of gruelling
              "Dokho Races" in which young hopefuls must carry heavy baskets over
              steep tracks across the Nepalese mountains.</p>
              <p>Gurkha soldiers are mostly led by British officers, although
              since the 1960s the brightest Nepalese have undergone officer training
              at Sandhurst and risen through the ranks.</p>
              <p>Prince Harry served with a detachment of Gurkhas during his recent deployment to southern Afghanistan.</p>

              <h3>Desevering case Britain rejects</h3>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>Thousands of Gurkha veterans who fought for Britain have been denied the right to live and settle here. </strong></p>
              <p><strong>And there are plenty of other deserving cases who have been
              torn from their families and sent back to their home countries by
              officials. </strong></p>
              <p><strong>Yet at the same time, human rights legislation means scores of
              criminals and illegal immigrants have been granted the right to live
              here, usually at great expense to the taxpayer. </strong></p>
              <p><strong>Here the Daily Mail details some of the men and women who
              should be allowed to live in Britain - and undeserving cases who have
              been told they can stay.</strong></p>
              <p><span class="underline">Madan Kumar Gurung</span></p>
              <p>The 55-year-old served in the Gurkha Transport Regiment for 24 years, protecting British interests in Hong Kong.</p>
              <p>He patrolled the buffer between Hong Kong and mainland China with live
              ammunition, watching for signs of trouble. He later became a training
              officer for the regiment, testing the driving skills of young soldiers.</p>
              <p>Despite his decorated service, Home Office officials rejected his
              application for indefinite leave to remain in Britain earlier this
              year.</p>
              <p>During the year-long process, Mr Gurung has been unable to work or open
              a bank account, living off the charity of relatives and financial aid
              from the Royal British Legion.</p>
              <p>Yesterday he handed back his precious Long Service and Good Conduct medal in protest at his treatment.</p>
              <p>He said: "I feel anger and sadness about my treatment, having served for 24 years with complete loyalty.</p>
              <p>"Handing my medal back was one of the saddest moments of my whole life. I earned my medal through hard work and dedication.</p>
              <p>"But the medal means nothing if I can't remain in Britain. I cannot
              understand why the Government is not allowing me to stay when so many
              others are allowed to remain."</p>
              <p>He is appealing against the Home Office's decision, and says he will go on hunger strike if it tries to deport him.</p>

              <p><span class="underline">Deborah Phillips</span></p>
              <p>Despite being the sole carer for her increasingly frail 80-year-old
              mother, Miss Phillips must leave the country in the next few weeks.</p>
              <p>She has no intention of claiming benefits and would save the taxpayer the cost of helping look after her mother.</p>
              <p>But because Miss Phillips was born in the U.S., moving to England when
              she was three, she has been refused permission to stay. She must leave
              by the end of April.</p>
              <p><span class="underline">Camille Beutler </span></p>
              <p>The American-born teenager has been ordered to leave after the authorities rejected her application for residency.</p>
              <p>But to comply, the 15-year-old grammar school pupil will have to leave
              both her parents and three siblings behind - tearing her family apart.</p>
              <p>Her American mother Lee-Ann Korpal, 37, may now have to travel to the
              U.S. to live with Camille because they have no living relatives there.
              But that will mean leaving her</p>
              <p>British businessman husband Nick, 45, and their other children behind because he does not have a U.S. work permit.</p>
              <p><span class="underline">Verah Kachepa </span></p>
              <p>A family of five were deported to Malawi in 2005, despite a
              long-running campaign to keep them in the country supported by Tory MP
              Ann Widdecombe.</p>
              <p>Volunteer worker Mrs Kachepa and her four children, who had settled in
              the country - with the eldest daughter engaged to a solider and due to
              study nursing - were escorted from their home in Weymouth, Dorset, to
              Heathrow.</p>
              <p>Mrs Kachepa fell foul of immigration laws after her husband, who had
              been working here legally, abandoned her and returned to Malawi.</p>
              <p>The Home Office refused to allow them to remain, despite evidence that they would be in danger if they went home.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <h3>...And the undesirables we keep</h3>
              <p> </p>

              <p><span class="underline">Learco Chindamo </span></p>
              <p>Italian-born Chindamo will be allowed to stay in Britain despite his
              12-year sentence for killing headmaster Philip Lawrence at his school
              in 1995.</p>
              <p>An immigration tribunal last year ruled that Chindamo, 27,
              could not be deported when he is freed because it would breach his
              right to a "family life".</p>
              <p>Chindamo, who moved to Britain when he was six, is eligible for parole this year.</p>
              <p><span class="underline">Yonis Dirie </span></p>
              <p>In 2006, a judge was told he could not deport the rapist because Dirie had been granted sanctuary in Britain.</p>
              <p>The drug addict and career criminal, a Somali, was given a ten-year sentence at the Old Bailey for the rape in 1990.</p>
              <p>Judge Gerald Gordon, QC, had asked if he could recommend the
              40-year-old be deported for what he described as "a truly horrendous
              crime".</p>
              <p>But he was told that because Dirie had been given indefinite
              leave to remain in the UK, he could not be sent back to his war-torn
              home country unless the Home Secretary intervenes.</p>

              <p><span class="underline">Carol Ajoh </span></p>
              <p>The asylum seeker, who falsely claimed she was a lesbian, was allowed
              to stay in Britain in 2006 - despite being a married mother of six.</p>
              <p>Ajoh was not sent home to the Caribbean after a judge ruled it would violate her human rights.</p>
              <p>In the High Court, Mr Justice Collins said her 2002 claim that
              she would be persecuted in Jamaica over her sexuality was "totally
              bogus".</p>
              <p>But because she remarried and gave birth to three children while her
              case was being decided, he said it "lacked humanity" to remove her.</p>
              <p><span class="underline">Afghan hijackers </span></p>
              <p>In February 2000, nine Afghans hijacked a Boeing 727 and forced the crew to fly to Stansted so they could claim asylum.</p>
              <p>After a series of legal battles costing taxpayers up to
              £15million, they were denied refugee status but told they could stay
              here on "discretionary leave" for human rights reasons.</p>
              <p>It gave the men the right to work, housing and a full range of benefits worth tens of thousands of pounds.</p>
