Singapore currently does not have any vehicle launched anti-aircraft missile (other than MANPADS that you can put inside the APCs) as far as I know, and something like that would be a welcome addition to the inventory,<br><br>Problems would be whether the missile can be slaved to current mobile air radar used and putting it on tracks if the army wants something to travel with its tanks and APCs.</div>

It is way way way too expensive... and dun mind me saying also... we ARE expendable. I expect a next generation protection based on multi direction sensor with "Claymore" like devices position in 360 degrees. By the way how does the top-down attack ATGM detect that it is above the tank? Radar? Image? or ACTIVE or PASSIVE?<br>if ACTIVE... the job of destorying it will be easier.<br><br>about the BARAK missile... dun be too confident about its<br>capabilities... cos can i know if you are the one operating it or you just read the information from reports? only the operator will know its REAL capabilities. hahaha dun look at me also .... i not a missile operator. And... dun put all eggs into one basket... once the weak point is identified, it is as good as useless until the point is closed.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Top attack ATGMs track and home unto the target as any other ATGM, they simply fly a bit higher then usual so they will overfly and fire their warhead down into the roof. In our case, it'll probably involve firing "kissing cousin" warheads down onto malaysian PT-91s and T-80s, immolating the tank crews in their poorly chosen equipment...</div>
