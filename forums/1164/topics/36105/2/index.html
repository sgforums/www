Note tat singapore is still a very young nation not even reaching 50. if you had studied a bit of history, singapore nationhood might just be a mirage or a legend to future generation who are studying history. so BOYS and GIRLS please consider the bigger picture.<br><br>now back to the topic.<br>for ATGMs, i know that optical guidance is passive but... for the ATGM to know whether it is above the target it still require some kind of Active senors right?? of cos unless u are at much higher elevation aim the cross hair directly at the top of the tank.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Simple, top attack ATGMs, many of which are still optically guided, simply fly a few meters above the aim point... I'm sure if you are aiming from different heights then the malaysian MBT through, you have to compensate your aim accordingly...<br><br>However, more advanced ATGMs like the Javelin are fire and forget, you just pop off a round and bug out. This ATGM can have multiple flight attack profiles that you can select before attacking, direct fire to take out bunkers, or top attack, of which the Javelin will actually fly in an arc and home down onto the roof of the target, firing it's 8.4 kg tandem HEAT warhead capable of defeating 600mm of armor straight into the top thin armor of the PT-91. At a range of up to 2,500 meters and with the ability to fire and forget, those malaysians will not know what hit them...</div>
