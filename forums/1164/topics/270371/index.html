The loss of an individual weapon is an extremely serious thing! Especially when you are talking about the stuff the SAF uses which are assualt weapons far banned by civillian laws!<br><br>In one case, an M203 got lost, the M203 is a 40mm grenade launcher that can launch High Explosive Dual Purpose grenades out to 400 meters!

Such a compromise in intelligence is far more damaging, and will endanger more lives then 7 or 9 rocket launchers.<br><br>Have you even served NS before? It is drilled in from day one that losing your weapon and sensitive equipment is not an UNAVOIDABLE thing and you must protect them TO THE PAIN OF DEATH. In fact it is so serious that before you get your weapon for the first time, you must take an oath.<br><br>Seriously, if you think it's unavoidable, especially in peacetime and training... then it's plainly obvious you are drawing out a standard that is not seen in any professional military.<br><br><blockquote><strong>But how about<br><br>2.7 or 9 rockets launchers missing in Aussie.Can u remember?</strong></blockquote>Are you forgetting this case where an SAF 90mm AT rocket launcher somehow ended up in civillian hands not too long ago?<br><br>What about this dude that stole a grenade and used it to threaten the people he didn't like?<br><br>What about this guy who smuggled an M-16 out from camp, and used it to commit crimes in Singapore?<br><br>So what's so different between us and them?
