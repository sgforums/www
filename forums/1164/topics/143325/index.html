Williams.<br><br>The cities chosen as optimal targets are New York, Miami, Los Angeles, Philadelphia, Chicago, San Francisco, Las Vegas, Boston and Washington, D.C. New York and Washington top the preferred target list for al-Qaida leadership.<br><br>Bin Laden's goal, according to G2 Bulletin sources, is to launch one initial attack, followed by a second on another city to simulate the U.S. bombing of Hiroshima and Nagasaki. The optimal dates for the attacks are Aug. 6, the anniversary of the Hiroshima bombing, Sept. 11 and May 14, the anniversary of the re-creation of the state of Israel in 1948. No specific year has been suggested, however, this Aug. 6 represents the 60th anniversary of the Hiroshima attack.<br><br>One of the sources for the information is Khalid Sheikh Mohammed, the chief planner of the Sept. 11 attacks, who is now in U.S. custody.<br><br>al-Qaida has obtained at least 40 nuclear weapons from the former Soviet Union Â– including suitcase nukes, nuclear mines, artillery shells and even some missile warheads. In addition, documents captured in Afghanistan show al-Qaida had plans to assemble its own nuclear weapons with fissile material it purchased on the black market.<br><br>U.S. military sources also say there is evidence to suggest al-Qaida is paying former Russian special forces "Spetznaz" troops to assist the terrorist group in locating nuclear weapons planted in the U.S. during the Cold War.<br>At least half the nuclear weapons in the al-Qaida arsenal were obtained for cash from the Chechen terrorist allies.<br><br>===============<br><br>wow..........now how?</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Disagree on the China being more dangerous than extremists part...<br><br>Fundamental reason - China is a nation state... extremists aren't... which flows into 2 key concepts:<br><br><strong>1. Deterrence </strong>- After such a nuclear attack has taken place, even with overwhelming superiority in military power (thousands and thousands of nuclear warheads), the US cannot hit back without killing 1 million times more innocent people because of the key question "where?".<br><br><strong>2. Benefits of Co-existence</strong> - You can negotiate logically with a nation state, compromise and coexist with another nation state... With nation states, there is a strong benefit of coexistence and cooperation... with extremists, you can't as there is no such thing... due to their absolutism... you are either with me or against me... either you have a true God or you are 'Godless'... and extremists view all who are against them deserve to be destroyed...<br><br>This is why one is so much more dangerous than the other.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>What IF, China and Osama are actually working hand in hand.  Instigate terrorist attack on US Soil, at the same time, attempting to recapture Taiwan.  While the ruckus goes on in US, China-Taiwan,  The Arab Countries try to invade Israel again.  Russian Troops marches towards Europe ---&gt; God save the Ivans *grin*<br><br>I can already foresee US military having to stretch itself to handle potentially hostile situations around the world.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>The nuclear warhead will need to be detonated at a suitable height (more than 100 or 200 m above ground) for it to achieve the desirable effect. It will not be easy for Al Qaeda to get a suitable plane to carry the warhead. The chances for him to detonate a second one will be even lesser if he chooses it to be on a later date.<br><br>I think instead of a nuclear attack, he must be working on biological ones as well. The avian bird flu is a simple one to work on esp. if the flu become contagious. It will be very easy to spread the flu in a crowded New York metro. It won't have the one-day big impact as like the nuclear attack, but it is much more easy to carry out.<br><br>If he needs money, I will think he will choose the nuclear attack as he can sell short in London stock market and make big bucks out of it.</div>
