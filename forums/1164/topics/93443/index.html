            <div class='col-md body'>Ok lar ask u all questions<br><br>1. RSAF announced that we gonna have  2 different types aircraft right??<br><br>2. So ar, with the purchase of NGF, we are also to phase out A4-SU and F-5T  right?<br><br>3. RSAF indicated we gonna be a small participant in F-35 right?<br><br>4. when do you think the 2 types of aircraft going to take place in?<br><br>5. Our first F-16 came at 1988,RSAF normally keep planes for 30 years<br>that means 14 years more our first F-16 , furthermore around in y2k period<br>we still took F-16<br><br>6. Say F-35A is going to be 2nd type so which is going to be the 1st type?<br><br>7. Will A4-SU pilots and the F-5 Pilots be retrenched or post to other places?<br>Will they go learn another new plan or go overseas detachment?<br><br>8. I would like to know if there's a replacement for our neighbour's<br>SU-30 and MIG-29 and is USA going to offer it to them?<br>Is it going to be SU-35 or SU-47 for them?<br><br>9. Are we going to purchase 1 for 1 for every aircraft purchased?<br><br>10. Are we going to need lesser aircraft now?<br><br>11. How many NGF are we going to take in total?<br><br>12. 1 last thing, if u can't answer nvm.<br><br>i will write down these question and ask my platoon seargent next<br>time i step inside tekong! <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz"><br><br>So is the F-35 going to partner the NGF in the future to meet the 2 type requirement?<br><br>That means all 3 of the types of aircraft we using CURRENTLY going to completely GONE, in the period ?<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>1. RSAF announced that we gonna have  2 different types aircraft right?? &lt;&lt;&lt; RSAF has so many types of aircraft. Even a helicopter is an aircraft.<br><br>2. So ar, with the purchase of NGF, we are also to phase out A4-SU and F-5T  right? &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; A4 yes, f-5 not quite yet.<br><br>3. RSAF indicated we gonna be a small participant in F-35 right? &lt;&lt;&lt; Big boss knows<br><br>4. when do you think the 2 types of aircraft going to take place in? &lt;&lt;&lt; Take place in what?<br><br>5. Our first F-16 came at 1988,RSAF normally keep planes for 30 years<br>that means 14 years more our first F-16 , furthermore around in y2k period<br>we still took F-16 &lt;&lt;&lt; There is no fixed timing on keeping an aircraft, RSAF looks at the operation and usage. Once an aircraft has reached operation capabilities (costs too much to maintain and service), RSAF will look into replacing it.<br><br>6. Say F-35A is going to be 2nd type so which is going to be the 1st type? &lt;&lt;&lt; Could you link a report of this to me?<br><br>7. Will A4-SU pilots and the F-5 Pilots be retrenched or post to other places?<br>Will they go learn another new plan or go overseas detachment? &lt;&lt;&lt; Pilots do not get retrenched, they will be retrained, just like the ground crew and they will be posted to other units.<br><br>8. I would like to know if there's a replacement for our neighbour's<br>SU-30 and MIG-29 and is USA going to offer it to them?<br>Is it going to be SU-35 or SU-47 for them? &lt;&lt;&lt; USA offer what? their aircraft? politically, don't think so.<br><br>9. Are we going to purchase 1 for 1 for every aircraft purchased? &lt;&lt;&lt; Depends on operation and usage.<br><br>10. Are we going to need lesser aircraft now? &lt;&lt;&lt; Depends on operation and usage.<br><br>11. How many NGF are we going to take in total? &lt;&lt;&lt; Haven't even decide what to get. Don't count your chickens before they hatch.<br><br>12. 1 last thing, if u can't answer nvm.<br><br>i will write down these question and ask my platoon seargent next<br>time i step inside tekong! <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz">  &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; Your PS is going to know nuts about what happens in the RSAF.<br><br>So is the F-35 going to partner the NGF in the future to meet the 2 type requirement? &lt;&lt;&lt; F-35 is an aircraft, not a company. What partner are you talking about????<br><br>That means all 3 of the types of aircraft we using CURRENTLY going to completely GONE, in the period ? &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; We have alot of aircraft.

            <div class='col-md body'>16 March 2004<br>SINGAPORE JOINS JOINT STRIKE FIGHTER PROGRAMME<br><br>Singapore has signed the Letter of Offer and Acceptance to participate in the System Development and Demonstration Phase of the Joint Strike Fighter (JSF) programme as a Security Co-operation Participant (SCP). The JSF programme is a US-led multi-nation project to develop an advanced, cost-effective multi-role stealth strike fighter that can perform air defence and ground attack missions with precision engagement, enhanced combat survivability and lower cost of maintenance.<br><br>SingaporeÂ’s bilateral SCP arrangement with the US provides an early opportunity to assess the JSFÂ’s ability to meet the Republic of Singapore Air ForceÂ’s longer-term operational requirements for a multi-role fighter. Singapore will have insights into the JSFÂ’s development progress and be able to conduct studies for integration of SingaporeÂ’s requirements into the JSF. As an SCP, Singapore can also request early purchase of the JSF for delivery from 2012 onwards.<br><br>Singapore is the only Asian country to sign an SCP Letter of Offer and Acceptance for the JSF programme. The LOA follows a Letter of Intent signed in February 2003, which laid down the broad principles for the SCP arrangement.<br><br>Mindef News.</div>
