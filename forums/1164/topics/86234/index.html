How many live missiles do you expect the RSAF to expend every year? Besides, I've yet to see ANY evidence that the overall life-cycle costs of an F-15 is less than that of the Rafale. You're again looking at a very narrow part of a very big picture to argue your case.<br><br></div>

Esp different manufacturer say their is better.<br><br>Think the objective is not to just run out there and grab the best plane, but more of the most cost effective that can do the job.<br><br>There is a lot of arguement and question over the F/A 18E , think F16C is still the better choice, as it is the most cost efficient plane to run long term. So even the F18 E is better, it have 2 engines which eat up fuels, you may have the better plane, but more costly for replacement and long term maintanence.<br>While operating the F16C, you ensure you have money for replacements.</div>

Ties, especially military ties with France have never been stronger. On top of the AJT deal in Cazaux, theres Eastern Arc and Western Arc as well as ODAX exercises between the 2 Air Forces. Not to mention the small issue of the biggest RSN project is a colloboration with the French.<br><br>Of course they might do the same, but that is EXACTLY why we must diversify our weapon sources. You've just proven my point, thanks!<br><br><strong></strong><blockquote><strong><br>And, France has always wanted to get our deal...

Anyway, if you want to debate NGF, what does the Mirage have to do with it?</div>
