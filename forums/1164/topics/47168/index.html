            <div class='col-md body'>Budget constraints force revsiion of plans, but Suhkoi Su-30 acquisition moving forward.<br><br>Malaysia has reduced and delayed its planned acquitistion of Boeing F/A-18F Super Hornets, but appears to be moving forward with a reduced purchase of Suhkoi Su-30s.<br><br>Malaysia requested pricing proposal for 18 F/A-18Fs and 18 Su-30s and planned to go forward simultaneously with both deals this year.  But industry resources say budget constraints have forced it to revise its request to 12 aircratf of each type, while poliical issues could prompt Malaysia to compete the Suhkoi transaction ahead of long expected Super Hornet purchase.<br><br>Budget and politcal ussyes a threaten to delay Malaysia's acquitisation of three or four unspecified airborne early warning and control (AEW &amp; C) aircraft.<br><br>US companies fear the Iraq war and its impact on relations between Malaysia and the USA could slow the Super Hornet purchase and other potential acquistition of US equipment.  Malaysian prime minister Mahathir Mohamad has criticised the USA's involovement in Iraq, and politically, it would be diffcult to buy US arms until hostilities fade.<br><br>Mahathir visited Embarer last month as aprt of a trade mission to Brazil.  Embraer is offering Malaysia EMB-14SSAs with Ericsson Erieye radar.  Northrop Grumman is pitching ex-US Navy E-2C Hawkeyes upgraded with technology from newer Hawkeye 2000s and Boeing offered its 737AEW &amp; C.<br><br>Sources says Malaysia favours a jet, given its long coastline, but 737 us too costly.

Among the aircraft considered is the E-2 Hawkeye.<br><br>There is no allocation in the Eighth Malaysia Plan to procure the aircraft but RMAF will attempt to purchase them, he said.<br><br>Abdullah said 45 years ago, RMAF had only 12 personnel and one aircraft, but now it owned 200 aircraft with 15,000 personnel.<br><br>Electronic warfare had developed rapidly and airborne early warning and command aircraft (AWAC) are crucial for the RMAF to monitor the airspace effectively, he said.<br><br>The parade included the Air Force College Colours, and the 3rd and 9th squadron fly by involving 22 fighter jets - comprising F/A 18D, Hawk, and the MiG 29N - as well as the CN 235, C130 transport planes and Nuri helicopters. -- BERNAMA<br></div>

The AIM-154 Phoenix is a large terminal active radar guided missile designed to shoot down Soviet multi-engined anti-shipping bombers threatening USN carrier groups with their supersonic AShMs. It is not designed to deal with fast nimble fighters and is an anachronistic dinosaur in todays air combat environment.<br><br>As for the Tomcat, it was a good fighter in its day, but its time has come and gone and it should be replaced. Its now too old and too costly to keep in operation and should be retired, although, no offence to the Super Bug, it really leaves quite a bit to be desired as far as replacing the Tomcats capabilities are concerned.</div>

And so it is with air-power without Airborne Warning and Control System (Awacs) aircraft.<br><br>Defence planners insist on it for maximum effectiveness in deployment and logistics.<br><br>But they cost a bomb. The four Awacs aircraft requested by the Royal Malaysian Air Force will cost a total of RM4 billion Â— an amount which has to be weighed against other competing priorities and the country's exposure to external dangers. From the point of view of defence, this may well be money well spent if we are to protect our skies and seas from unfriendly intrusions, including that of piracy. As the air force is buying more advanced aircraft, an Awacs capability will be a necessary enhancement.<br><br>However, Defence Minister Datuk Seri Najib Tun Razak said in response to the RMAF proposal yesterday that, "There is certainly a need for it in the future but not at the moment. The purchase of such sophisticated aircraft will incur huge expenses as well as the need for proper planning. Therefore it cannot be done hastily. Besides, the Government is not in a position to do so financially now." In these circumstances, land-based radar is the only option even though its range is limited by the earth's curvature. There is still life and sufficient security without Awacs, although Singapore, a tiny and therefore insecure island amid much larger neighbours, has the advanced aircraft.<br><br>It is an irony that the best way to maintain peace is to have a credible military force that will deter foreign aggression. In these days of high-tech warfare, a defence force needs to be armed with the latest weapons, because technology does give the military a vital edge in an armed conflict. The reality is that courage and numbers alone are not enough in this era of electronic warfare.<br><br>Although Awacs is a necessary part of this process, at this particular moment it does not rate the highest priority.</div>
