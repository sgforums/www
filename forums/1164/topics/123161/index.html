So usually, I put my spare No. 4 and socks into the ALICE pack first...jacket on top of that..since I'm the signaller, I got my dumb signal set, together with 2-3 spare batteries also...I usually tear up up combat rations and distribute it to the sides of the ruck, with maybe two packets of rice, some biscuits, and fruit bars in the front pocket. I usually put another 2-3 canteens in my ALICE ruck...usually with the top few items, like poncho, groundsheet, hammock,   I remember having the rifle cleaning kit in my left pocket. Foot powder, toothbrush/toothpaste, camo facekit in the right pocket. oh yes...and my chewing tobacco/cigarettes in the left pocket too...together with the rifle cleaning kit.. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"></div>

In any case, that pack's a b!tch to lug around without the frame.  One of my signallers decided to undo his 20-foot line when he jumped, so when he released his ALICE pack at 200 feet, it went splat.  The signal set was fine because the frame took all the impact, but the unlucky sod had to lug the pack sans frame for the rest of the mission, and he decidedly did not have a good time.</div>
