The country of origin is S.Africa...so mebbe they do the handloading there? But frankly...how much more does a person save with handloading? And does it make more $$ and Sense to buy off the shelf for an army or to do reloading?<br><br>Btw Meia...don't mind me asking...you mentioned that the rifle cartridges go through a white-hot flame for annealing, but what about pistol cartridges?</div></blockquote>Interesting. I did not know South Africa supplied munitions to the SAF.<br><br>The next time you get an opportunity to do so, take a look at the base of a 5.56mm cartridge. If you see the letters <strong>PMP</strong> stamped there, it means the cartridge was manufactured by Pretoria Metal Pressings in South Africa. PMP is a division of Denel, South Africa's largest munitions manufacturer. I occasionally come across spent PMP 5.56mm cases at the range here, and have even reloaded a few.<br><br>Commercial ammo prices here have skyrocketed in recent years due to the increasing prices of metals on the commodities markets. You <span style="font-style: italic;">do</span> save a lot of money by reloading, particularly in the larger calibers. You also benefit from the ability to customize rounds for individual firearms and/or applications. To give an example, a 50-round box of Winchester 40 S&amp;W 165 gr. range/target ammunition typically goes for around $12. I am able to reload 50 rounds of 40 S&amp;W ammunition, using cleaner-burning powder and with better attention to quality control, for a little under $5 in raw component costs, broken down as follows:<br><br>Projectiles: $3.40<br>Powder: $0.65<br>Primers: $0.85<br>Cases: FREE! (Range pick-ups)<br>Total: $4.90<br><br>I haven't come across any pistol cases that are annealed, but that doesn't mean it's not done. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"></div>

Individual machines at the factory can be set up to load different calibers to meet production demands, and the settings may not remain consistent for any one caliber, resulting in variations in powder weight, bullet seating depth and/or neck crimping. In other words, the box of "premium" ammo you buy today may look and be marked as being identical to the same ammo you bought last month, but if they were produced in different production runs, there is the chance their performance may not be identical.</div>

I did not know South Africa supplied munitions to the SAF.<br><br>The next time you get an opportunity to do so, take a look at the base of a 5.56mm cartridge. If you see the letters [b]PMP</strong> stamped there, it means the cartridge was manufactured by Pretoria Metal Pressings in South Africa. PMP is a division of Denel, South Africa's largest munitions manufacturer. I occasionally come across spent PMP 5.56mm cases at the range here, and have even reloaded a few.<br><br>Commercial ammo prices here have skyrocketed in recent years due to the increasing prices of metals on the commodities markets. You <span style="font-style: italic;">do</span> save a lot of money by reloading, particularly in the larger calibers. You also benefit from the ability to customize rounds for individual firearms and/or applications. To give an example, a 50-round box of Winchester 40 S&amp;W 165 gr. range/target ammunition typically goes for around $12. I am able to reload 50 rounds of 40 S&amp;W ammunition, using cleaner-burning powder and with better attention to quality control, for a little under $5 in raw component costs, broken down as follows:<br><br>Projectiles: $3.40<br>Powder: $0.65<br>Primers: $0.85<br>Cases: FREE! (Range pick-ups)<br>Total: $4.90<br><br>I haven't come across any pistol cases that are annealed, but that doesn't mean it's not done. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy">[/b]</blockquote>Sorry for digging up old posts. But yeah, south africa do supply saf with 5.56mm balls round. But only recently like in the past 2 year. As for recycling of spent rounds, saf usually do not reload. The empty brass cart are sold off for money ( now u know why when returning ammo, the weight of RAI returned must be almost 90% of total RAI), and all rounds are brand new. For saf, the rounds usually have a life span of 10 years. If any info is wrong, kindly address it. Hope this clear some doubts.</div>
