            <div class='col-md body'><span style="color: darkred;">It is surprising that the Chinese Navy plan to build at least ten <span style="font-style: italic;">'modern'</span> tank-landing ship had preferred to follow a 6,000 ton LST design that is entirely unique to RSN, while other navies operate similar types of vessel classed as LSD and are of heavier design.<br><br>The following is an extract from a report that detailed <a href="http://www.encyclopedia.com/doc/1G1-135818480.html" rel="nofollow">'The evolution of China's military policy and military doctrine'</a>, which provide additional material for discussion:</span><br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">''In early 2007, the PRC Navy could accept into service a new type of a lead tank-landing ship (the entire series of approximately 10 ships). With an estimated displacement of 5,000 to 6,000 tonnes, it will have capacity to carry up to one tank company and up to an amphibious landing battalion. Right now the Chinese Navy has more than 50 amphibious warfare ships with capacity to land up to a marine corps brigade in the first assault wave. Putting into service a new series of amphibious warfare ships with improved specifications will almost double the Chinese Navy's capacity for amphibious landing of personnel and equipment--up to a marine corps division, which is already an operational-tactical level. ''</span><br><br><span style="color: darkred;">Note one part of the report - [officially denied] - had also included the following:</span><br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">''According to reports in the media, China's Navy modernization program includes the building of three aircraft carriers with a displacement of up to 40,000 tonnes with Su-27 class aircraft aboard (up to 40). (19) The keel of the first warship has already been laid<br><br>Judging by the existing experience, the aircraft carrier group could be comprised of up to six to eight surface warships, two to three attack nuclear submarines, and one or two auxiliary vessels.''</span><br><br><span style="color: darkred;">Although the report provide plausible reason for China's naval modernisation and expansion as a force projection to protect its growing global economic interests, it growth path seems to be more aggressive then defensive by design.<br><br>China is surely building up a Navy that will allow it to invade Taiwan - in the event that a Taiwanese maverick President declare independence - and with a navy strong enough to fend off any American naval intervention. </span><br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>They are going to need more than just 3 40K tonne Aircraft carriers, as the US Navy can bring to bare 4-5 90K tonne Aircraft carriers with their accompanying carrier battle groups. Of course, they can make the operation costly for the US Navy to persecute, but the question is how much are the Chinese willing to risk their fleet in a massive duel not seen since WWII.<br><br>That aside, I vaguely recall the French deploying a new class of LSTs which are significantly larger than ours and many navies are employing helicopter carriers which also serve to deploy troops.

SM-2 only can be launched subject to fire channel available, thereÂ’re only 2 APG-62 FCR on board Aegis DDGs. As such, if a combo attack from joint air &amp; naval operation, the engagement by CVGs will become very complicate. Because CVBGs not only need handle sea skimming subsonic AshM like C802/803, but also supersonic missiles like Sunburn and Club-S or Club-N, as well as supersonic Anti-radiation missiles like KH-31P. In a real war, I doubt a complicate system will function perfectly as theoretically predicted. The Israeli SAAR V is a vivid example, the capable 3D volume search radar even canÂ’t detect a single C802 in time. Imagining, in real war, any miss handled missile means a punch and probably the breakthrough point to destruct the coordinated air defens.<br><br>2nd, itÂ’s always true, Air power determines sea power. So the most reliable air defense of CVBGs is their shipborne fighter jets. Not Aegis, however, if itÂ’s too close to the Chinese coast, it may face superior numbered land based fighter jets, plus PLA shipborne fighters in future.

SM-2 only can be launched subject to fire channel available, thereÂ’re only 2 APG-62 FCR on board Aegis DDGs. As such, if a combo attack from joint air &amp; naval operation, the engagement by CVGs will become very complicate. Because CVBGs not only need handle sea skimming subsonic AshM like C802/803, but also supersonic missiles like Sunburn and Club-S or Club-N, as well as supersonic Anti-radiation missiles like KH-31P. In a real war, I doubt a complicate system will function perfectly as theoretically predicted. The Israeli SAAR V is a vivid example, the capable 3D volume search radar even canÂ’t detect a single C802 in time. Imagining, in real war, any miss handled missile means a punch and probably the breakthrough point to destruct the coordinated air defens.</blockquote>That's because they were caught with their pants down.

They just demoed the system against mortar rounds recently with 100% success. In theory, it is possible to use the same system and tweak it such that it might work against Ballistic missiles as well.<br><br>AS for the F-22s, the objectives of the F-22s will be to fend off the Chinese Fighter squadrons and attempt to keep them at bay. The need to launch deep strike missions will be likely turned over to stealth bombers and a possible new stealth bomber which is an idea that has been floating around for a while.<br><br>Also, it is highly unlikely the USN will approach too close to the Chinese shore since that is inviting trouble from shore based batteries. Likely the initial objectives will be to weather to wave of Chinese attacks and then at the appropriate opportunities, attempt to neutralise the shore batteries and perhaps launch some deep strike missions. It should be noted however, the USN with its current stock of fighters can't really launch deep strike missions since they lack the range to do so.<br><br><blockquote>SM-3 is designed to intercept Ballistic missile in boosting stage and midcourse, not in the descending stage of the Ballistic missile.

The Soviets themselves have shadowed US carriers before, sometimes undetected.

            <div class='col-md body'>Sorry, I have to say, some more basic knowledge on submarine warfare may let one know more facts behind the everybody known story.<br><br>1.	Basic fact 1, nobody use SSK to shadow CVGs, only SSN got the stamina &amp; pace which can barely chase a CVG constantly moving at a speed easily over 20 knots. If a SSK running at such a speed, the battery will be flat in hours and the generated noise can be easily picked up by anti-submarine warfare.<br>2.	But how come can a PLA SSK intercept a CVN thousand kms away from the Chinese coast? IMO, it actually reveals a more fearsome capability of PLA, That is PLA now can effectively detect and track CVGs thousand kms away from its coast. That ability requiring credible space/surface based surveillance asserts, airborne or space based Elint/Sigint asserts. Long range OTH radar, and C4IR network. Only PLA can track the CVGs moving, then can venture its SSK silently into the path of the Kitty Hawk CVN.  Do remember, Kitty Hawk CVG then was in a drill and only broadcasted roughly location in the seaÂ” off OkinawaÂ”, put Okinawa as the center and using  100kms  as the radius, you can easily draw a circle with a area over 31400 sq kms. No way, a slow moving PLA SSK can intercept the CVN by luck.<br></div>
