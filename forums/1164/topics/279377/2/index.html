            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by coolant:</div><div class="quote_body">Sorry, I have to say, some more basic knowledge on submarine warfare may let one know more facts behind the everybody known story.<br><br>1.	Basic fact 1, nobody use SSK to shadow CVGs, only SSN got the stamina &amp; pace which can barely chase a CVG constantly moving at a speed easily over 20 knots. If a SSK running at such a speed, the battery will be flat in hours and the generated noise can be easily picked up by anti-submarine warfare.<br>2.	But how come can a PLA SSK intercept a CVN thousand kms away from the Chinese coast? IMO, it actually reveals a more fearsome capability of PLA, That is PLA now can effectively detect and track CVGs thousand kms away from its coast. That ability requiring credible space/surface based surveillance asserts, airborne or space based Elint/Sigint asserts. Long range OTH radar, and C4IR network. Only PLA can track the CVGs moving, then can venture its SSK silently into the path of the Kitty Hawk CVN.  Do remember, Kitty Hawk CVG then was in a drill and only broadcasted roughly location in the seaÂ” off OkinawaÂ”, put Okinawa as the center and using  100kms  as the radius, you can easily draw a circle with a area over 31400 sq kms. No way, a slow moving PLA SSK can intercept the CVN by luck.<br></div></blockquote>Possibly. It should be noted that China has a fair bit of electronic assets. Also, as you say, an SSK will most likely choke and die while chasing the carrier, especially those with no AIP. I think at the moment the Chinese are also working towards satellite visual assets etc.<br><br>That aside, I am not sure. Chinese spies maybe?</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Oppps, How I missed this part AGAIN.<br><br><blockquote> Broadly speaking, the US has been working on the use of lasers to intercept artillery and mortar rounds with a fair bit of fast reaction time. They just demoed the system against mortar rounds recently with 100% success. In theory, it is possible to use the same system and tweak it such that it might work against Ballistic missiles as well. </blockquote>Ya, in theory, If you really know how the chemical laser function and limitations, you wouldnÂ’t count on such a source to destruct incoming BM hundreds kms away. Till now, how many years passed, how about the B747 ABL? Such thing can cheat media, not PLA.<br><br><blockquote>AS for the F-22s, the objectives of the F-22s will be to fend off the Chinese Fighter squadrons and attempt to keep them at bay. The need to launch deep strike missions will be likely turned over to stealth bombers and a possible new stealth bomber which is an idea that has been floating around for a while. </blockquote>Stealth bomber? You think the Stealth planes are really non-detectable? Once detected, the less maneuverable bombers are as good as dead. 1 or 2 billion bucks a piece, sounds nothing huh? You still owe me an answer why you so sure two nuclear armed giants will fight direct war into each otherÂ’s territories? You still owe me an answer why in korea war, PLA drove hundreds of thousands Yanks force back to 38 deg but Yanks still dare not to bomb single target within Chinese territory? If US bombs any targets within China, which signals itÂ’s upgrading the war, the war can be escalated out of control. TWO NUCLEAR ARMED GIANTS WILL NEVER FIGHT SUCH A WAY. The F-22Â’s available airbase near Taiwan is Okinawa, the other one is thousand kms far of Guam. How long can it stay in the theater that delivers substantially to the strategic level instead of some tactic shoot-downs.<br><br><blockquote> My bad, I was referring to the SM-2 for its primary role as an anti-missile and anti-air missile which has a range of up to 370km.</blockquote>Wow, so far, IÂ’m wondering how the X-band SPG-62 provides an illumining as far as 370kms! No, SM-2, see the JaneÂ’s report, currently No US aDS is capable to intercept such a ASBM.<br><br><span style="color: blue;"> Â“The US is not expected to deploy any effective sea-based defence by 2009 that could counter a DF-21 class anti-ship missile.Â”</span><br><br><a href="http://www.sgforums.com/?action=thread_display&amp;thread_id=174893" rel="nofollow">http://www.sgforums.com/?action=thread_display&amp;thread_id=174893</a><br><br><blockquote>Also, it is highly unlikely the USN will approach too close to the Chinese shore since that is inviting trouble from shore based batteries. Likely the initial objectives will be to weather to wave of Chinese attacks and then at the appropriate opportunities, attempt to neutralise the shore batteries and perhaps launch some deep strike missions. It should be noted however, the USN with its current stock of fighters can't really launch deep strike missions since they lack the range to do so.</blockquote>Then you know shipborne fighters have its combat range, if itÂ’s too far from the Taiwan strait, the time of stay-in-battle will be shortened as well, which means less impact to the offending force. Which means a less concern and wonÂ’t affect too much in landing operation as a determining factor. BTW, DF-21 Anti-ship Ballstic Missile got a range of 2000kms, how far you want to stay away?<br><br></div>

They have been in use for a long while and sold around etc.<br><br>Solid State lasers will eventually hit the MW range. Right now, they are straddling KW.<br><br>The B747 laser, last I checked, is undergoing development. You do realise that software development takes years right? And just so you didn't know, the S-300 systems China initially bought had serious system integration issues and God knows if they have fixed them yet?<br><br><blockquote>Stealth bomber?

I am only hypothesizing, and you go on jumping around as if I just insulted your ego. Did I say they are non-detectable? If not stealth bomber, send what? B-1As? If China invades and bombs Taiwan, isn't that itself escalating the war? What? Adopt a defensive posture only? Who are you kidding? Why should F-22s be based only in Japan? Isn't there Taiwan to defend?<br><br>Who are you to define the scope of the war? Face it, a fight over Taiwan will turn immediately into a full scale war. Already, the Taiwanese are adopting a more aggressive posture developing their own ballistic missiles. If not the US, Taiwan will bomb China on their own. What/ You expect the Taiwanese to be a bloody punching bag?<br><br><blockquote><br>Wow, so far, IÂ’m wondering how the X-band SPG-62 provides an illumining as far as 370kms!

Do you expect the bloody American military to go wank about their crap all the time or sit idly?

On one bloody hand you tell me they shouldn't escalate the war, on the other hand you insist they should. Moving too close to land simply exposes the USN to antiship missile batteries parked on the sea side. Never mind that damn BM of yours, the shore batteries will be enough of a threat.<br><br>And just so you don't know, the Israeli Arrow II does work against Ballistic missiles and I wonder what happens when someone decides to <span style="font-style: italic;">navalise</span> it just as the Soviets navalised their S-300.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>IÂ’m not groudless talking like you and just recall the most similar war pattern of Korea &amp; Vietnam war to illustrate my point that both US &amp; China wonÂ’t attack targets in each otherÂ’s own territory. USÂ’s intervene in Taiwan is the same in nature as it intervened in Korea in 1950s &amp; Vietnam in 1960s-1970s. That is, to contain China, in both cases, China responded militarily. In Korea, PLA fought directly with US face to face. In Vietnam, most of its operation is limited to AA warfare and transportation, you really think a small country like Vietnam can survive 10 years in the direct US invasion yet at the end defeat it? In both Vietnam &amp; Korea wars, when China still no credible Nuclear deterring force.  US still dared not to bomb across the border, Now, with China feature credible &amp; survivable nuclear deterring force, you ask me to follow your direct bombing each otherÂ’s wan wan game? No, I would rather follow the historical pattern to accesses the most likely scenario.</div>
