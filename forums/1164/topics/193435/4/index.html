I thought the Slinglish he did was 1st class!  2 thumbs up from me!!!<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br>Heng!  I felt that G3 although a good system, the delay roller block system makes the gun kicks like a SOB!! ,seriiously, same load on a G3 will kick th lights out of you compared with the FAL and M14.   also, the ergonomics of the G3 needs some critisism.. selector , cocking handle and all that needs some getting use to! and also if you have a fully loaded mag! it is hard load the mag to the rifle .. you have to change the way you use weapons, those M16 user will hate this ! say you have an empty mags, you remove the mag, charge the cocking handle to the rear, than insert the mag!  if you do it the M16 way of inseerting a full mag on the G3, you will have some trouble somtime to lock the mag in place.<br><br>Also! G3 does not hold bolt open on last round, after last shot!  tick! you have to change mag! no ease spring like the M16 or FAL!<br><br>Advantage of the G3 is that it is cheaper to produce because it uses roll steel instead of the milled receiver of the FAL.. better iron sights... looks really kool!   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz"> ...<br><br>The last but most annoying part for me about G3 is .... how dirty it is after firing ! It takes quite some effort to clean the G3, MP5, HK33 type weapon becasue of the gas blowing back to the bolt and bolt carrier thru the delay roller block system.<br><br>However, it is much more reliable than the FAL! hands down !  and much more accurate in terms of MOA accuracy becasue I guess the G3 has a floating barrel !!<br><br>Just IMHO!<br><br>DaveC<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>The Israelis, who never complain much about their weapons (cos they had so little of it in the early days) - had much to complain against the FN FAL.<br><br>After fighting one or two wars with it - Six Day War &amp; Yom Kippur? - they replaced it with something... Galil or M-16 I dunno.<br><br>They said that it was a good weapon but one that doesn't function in the sandy desert. Prone to jamming in the sandy environment.<br><br>They had a lot off respect for the AK the Arabs used - whom they said worked, no matter what you do to it. That's why they copied the AK in the Galil.<br><br>I love the FN FAL cause it is so sleek and beautiful. Which version, if any, of the FN FAL can fire full auto - I mean the rifle, not the LMG version.<br><br>I read a book that said in the Aussies in Vietnam used to jam matchsticks into some part of the trigger or sear and that'll cause their FN FAL to be able to fire full auto. This is illegal and they admit that it was a waste of ammo cos you'll hit nothing. But they said that in the jungle you can't see you enemies anyway. And a full auto burst from a 7.62 FN FAL sometimes had the effect of disheartening the VC.<br><br>Dave you should try sticking matchsticks into your FN FAL and see what happens!</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>moca<br><br>U are right!  the Isreali had so much problem with the metric FAL becasue the bolt did not have the sand cut to give way to the sand and grit ! .. As I have stated, FAL is not the most reliable ... in differnt weather we have to mess with the gas port to cycle the rifle better.. Also, in FA firing on the FAL, I have to switch the gas port to give it the extra ummmph. to cycle correctly...<br><br>If I have to fight in the sand box !

            <div class='col-md body'>I have seen pics of Australians with SLR in Vietnam with a hi-cap mag of 2x 20 round mags welded together to form one long mag. Too bad they didn't have any Bren 30-round mags on hand. But I think they use the original FN FAL version with the wooden furniture - metric or inch?<br><br>This is a ARS "rebuilt" weapon ... Aussie L1A1. Very like the one I saw during NS.<br><img src="http://www.arizonaresponsesystems.com/smith/fal/galleryfal/fal03.jpg"></div>

I guess thats why we go withthe 5.56!! but well worth it since it fits the L1A1.

            <div class='col-md body'>HI MOca<br><br>the ARS rifle looks like it uses a Type 3 receiver and as you know these are probably the Brazillian made Imbel receiver that can be mated to the Inch pattern rifle. I have one rifle built with British kits with the setup like the photo.. it works great but I do prefer the Type 1 over the Type 3 receiver.<br><br>The rifle kit is defeintly INch rifle...<br><br>If you want to be proper or anal about being correct, can go with a Type 1 Inch( with lightning cuts)  reciver by Entreprise Arms!  they have inch pattern receiver but their Quality control is a hit and miss deal.<br><br>DaveC</div>
