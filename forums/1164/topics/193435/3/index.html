            <div class='col-md body'>In SAF, we are required to pick up all our blanks and empty cartridges at the range or at live firing.<br><br>Especially picking up blanks is the worst cos usually you fire blanks in the forest during assault so they are really hard to find afterwards. Don't help either that they are black coloured plastic.<br><br>Live firing is usually done - for us infantry anyway - in open areas for safety reasons so the cartridges are easy to find. And they are shiny brass.<br><br>As also happens a lot of folks will just pick up a token amount but the instructors got smart and demand at least 80% recovery of the entire stock spent. We don't get to leave until we meet that quota.<br><br>I can understand you have to pick up the plastic blanks as they are completely non-biodegradable but I wonder what SAF does with the spent brass cartridges? Can they be reloaded or melted down?<br><br>One thing that is recurring problem with the spent cases be they blanks or live, is that people kept slipping on them. At the range at 300m where it is hard cement floor, I've seen a lot of guys slip and fall on empty brass especially when they are climbing the cament stairs into fox holes. Also udring FIBUA especially at night lots of guys would slip and fall or twist their ankles on empty cartridges on the floor.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Speaking of blanks, do you guys in the US use blanks much? What does a blank round in the US look like? What blanks do Hollywood uses? Especially on GPMG's where you can actually see the belted rounds, they look very real, unlike our SAF 7.62mm GPMG blanks which has an ugly-looking squashed head.<br><br>Our black plastic 5.56mm blanks are surely the worse shxt in the world, being really underpowered and prone to double feeding, and fouling the gas pipes and chamber reall badly. And worst, you need change the muzzle to this silly-looking nob with a little hole. Onn the Ultimax you need to attach this red thing that closes off the muzzle.<br><br>Those used in Hollywood look great. Fist of all, they are brass cartridges and they seem to be able to fire full-auto without problem. And secondly, they don't need any changes to the muzzle.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>No! we do not use blanks ! really have no use unless it is use for show! I think airsoft or paintball does a better training tool! NOw we use simunitions! but simunition is very expensive and it is only available for the law enforcements for most rifle simunition cartrdiges! ! and needs quite extensive modifications to the weapons.<br><br>Even in my time in SAF! we are required to pick up blanks from training area ! best part is at one time they get so anal about blanks that right after an ambush! we have to stop the excercise and pick blanks!

            <div class='col-md body'>its the mindset of the people,, in the US, you 2nd amendment dictates that you have the right to bear ARMS! ( Arms ) is a wide explanation! if in the era of bow and arrow, arms can be bow and arrow, it firearms than you can have firearms!<br><br>If you read US history! they form their country thru arms rebellion against the Bitish! thus govt having too much control is a scarry thing! ( again too much of anything or extreme can be bad since the govt can one day take over and change the world ! HItler is the best example) 1st thing he did is take away all forms of defences from the general population!than he go in and exterminate or do his crazy things with defenceless Subjects! .... Armed civilians are citizens, defenceless ones are Subjects!.... so what you want to be?????<br><br>in the US!most states other than those communisit state like Kalifornia, New York! Massachusetts where restriction of firearms are at its highest have the highest crime rate.   Not saying Texas is better or not but we do have conceal carrying permit where civilian goes thru training and proper background check and can carry in their daily life ! think about it! someone wants to rob you! and they don;t know if you are arm! .... in reality!  Crime actually reduces and it is a fact! from past history when Texas and Florida adopted the concel carry! crime drops!<br><br>As for most firearms ! Some people like military style weapons like M16, AK, or western style weapon like a Winchester model 1892, or hunting rifle like a Weatherby! all civilian can legally own semi-auto rifle! pistols! most of the assualt rifle in US are semi only.<br><br>However you can apply to buy full auto weapon as a collector! just like some people like fast cars , ming vase! some people collect weapons like me ! than you need to go thru a more vigurous background check and all that! than if your state is legal to own machine gun than !here comes MP-5 and M4<br>...  I also collect historical weapons like those of World War2.. to me that means more than having some Vase or monet painting! just a matter of preference! And living in the US gives you that choice ! Life is good!<br></div>

I agree totally ! i just have one underfolder becasue i think it is very koool looking!

You are qualify!<br><br>Which makes sense ! every adult should have the right to protect yourself as long as you are in the country legally.<br><br>TO own automatic weapons, Machine guns, short barrel rifle, sound supressors, you have to be  US citizen.  okay! 2 ways to apply for a class 3 NFA lisence.  one is your STate must allow Class 3 weapons.  than you have to apply the C3 lisence and have your district attorney, judge or local sheffif sign off your paperwork,..... than pay a $200 stamp fee to BATF ( Buera of Tobacco and firearms ( for every weapon)and than the price of the automatic weapon.  2nd way is to incorporate a corporation , than make yourself a officer in the corporation and register the gun to the corporation.  with the corporation way U don;t need to get the DA , judge or sherrif to sign you off.<br><br>THe problem boils down that a lot of sherrif or DA would not like to sign you off unlesss they know you!

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by moca:</div><div class="quote_body">Dave &amp; Meia<br><br>I'll assume you are both US citizens. So what kinds of background checks before you can carry a concealed firearm? Similarly, how do you qualify to own automatic weapons?</div></blockquote>Background checks are only part of the overall process required for a private citizen to obtain a carry license for a handgun. The application process can vary from state to state; I can only describe what the procedure is like for the state of Minnesota.<br><br>Citizens and permanent residents (a.k.a. "green card" holders) can apply for a carry license. You first have to attend a state-sanctioned firearms safety course. Such courses typically cover the situations and circumstances under which you are legally justified in using deadly force to protect yourself. The more practical aspects of daily carry pertaining to the proper use of holsters and concealment techniques are usually also covered. Candidates are also assessed on their firearms handling competency and have to complete a live fire exercise in which they are scored on accuracy. The successful completion of the course results in the issuance of a certificate that is valid for one year.<br><br>The applicant then has go in person to the county sheriff's office to fill in an application form for a carry permit. The certificate is attached and a $100 "processing fee" paid. The sheriff's office then performs all the necessary city, state and federal background checks, and if they come back clean, he has to issue you the carry permit within 30 business days by law.<br><br>Minnesota legally changed its carry permit process from "may issue" to "shall issue" back in 2003, after a long and drawn-out lobbying effort by gun rights advocacy groups that lasted many years. "May issue" means that the issuing authority (in most cases, the county sheriff) can deny your application despite your having met all the legal requirements; "shall issue" means that he is legally obliged to issue the permit if your meet all the necessary requirements.</div>
