I have since sold most of my AKM except one! the AK74 is so controllable and shoots as good as my MP-5 in Full auto!<br><br><img src="http://i3.photobucket.com/albums/y66/davechng/Guns/DSC00143.jpg"><br><br>Meia Gisborn, I do reload also, but mainly I reload for my SVD and Steyr SSG precision rifles.. for the assualt rifle I mainly use commercial grade stuff... maybe my reloading equipment needs some attention! I am using the Lee 1000 Progressive and the Turret! I know I need to get me the DIllion 650 or better.<br><br>YEs! COmmercial ammo has spiked like crazy in the US!.  7.62x39 we use to get it for $70 per 1000 rds now is like $120 in the gunshow ! .... fortunately we buy ammo of various carliber in the 10,000 rds lot so! I have enough till the shortage is over.<br><br>DaveC!</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Aren't you guys glad you did National Service - all that free ammo?<br><br>Dave, the best experience I had with shooting in the army are the night firing with tracers and illumination from mortars and other handheld flare devices.<br><br>Are you able to purchase tracer ammo and other illum ordnance? What about smoke grenades? Can you buy those?<br><br>What can't you buy in Texas? There has to be a limit, right?<br><br>Can you buy a 20mm anti-aircraft cannon? A old US 60mm mortar? M203 grenade launcher? Can you buy AP ammo for the Browning?<br><br>Also, there seemed to be no restriction on where you discharge your weapons and also no regulations on transportation? It seems you can just put 2 GPMGs and one HMG at the back of a pickup truck and drive around. So what if one decides to drive around a pickup truck with a mounted GPMG, is that allowed?<br><br>To be honest, this concept of civi owning GPMGs is not something I can understand. But if I were in Texas like you, I would slowly ponder this question while cleaning the tripod-mounted FN MAG in my front garden. : )</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hi Meia<br><br>for spent cases, since the shooting area is a flood zone!  few times a year the range is actually underwater ! so that clears the brass away! I do ppick up 5.56 , 30.06, .45 or 7.62 cases if they are boxer prime.  some freind go pick up those brass and sell them for scrap!  good money too!<br><br>HO Moca<br><br>Yes! I enjoyed my National service ,, back in the late 80s! am in 5th SIR! did quite a few big Battalion or Brigade live firing! Free ammo is really a good thing except in SAF!  or during my time, they can make the most enthusiats people with the most exciting skills like shooting and marksman a real chore.  and make it a real takan session.<br><br>Yes! We can buy tracers , infact I load my own tracers becasue it is cheaper that way! factory tracers are very expensive ! I like 30 caliber tracers becasue you can see them better.... I shoot them on my 7.62 or 30.06 rifles.  AP round is kind of a harsh harsh thing becasue they are not politically correct.  However, AP bullets are avialaible to be bought ! So! I do load AP rounds ... HOwver, as we know the M855, SS109, russian 7n6 5.45 ammo which is avialbale to be bought has AP quality..<br><br>Biggere caliber like the 40mm grenande launcher , 60mm motar can be bought but they are consider distructive device.  So! each round has a $200 stamp fee for the CLass 3 weapons registration!<br><br>However, 84mm or RPG-7 type weapons are not available to be bought!HOwitzers or anything like that is not available!<br><br>As for driving around with a class 3 ( machine gun) in your truck would not be recommended... although if you do have the proper papers, the police cannot arrest you unless you are pointing your weapons on people and create a civil unrest! AGain! I have seen reenactment where you see APC or jeeps with 30 caliber browning machine gun! but these people is on convoy and are on a reenactment type activities!<br><br>YEs! I Love the GPMG or they call it the M240B here in the US!  Miss the days when we do my GPMG course in the unit and safti! Good weapon ! make the M60 machine guns looks like toys and a joke.<br><br>I also love the Ulitmax 100 ... its light weight ! But except for the stupid drum! I don;t think it work as well as the M249 belt! as a SAW the feeding system on the U100 is questionable ! All drums don;t do well in the field ! My freind that is in Iraq have so much problems with the Beta mags!<br><br>DaveC</div>
