              <p>Don't know where you get your information, sport, but you need to start looking somewhere else.  In preparation for the invasion of Japan's home islands, MacArthur's own staff did their calculations twice and came up with a figure of more than 100,000 casualties for the invasion of Kyushu.  Note that this figure does not include the invasion of Honshu.</p>
              <p>Frankly, I think the 100K figure was optimistic.  As it is, in the preceding year, the casualty figure for the fighting in Iwo Jima, Okinawa, Luzon, Peliliu and the Marianas exceeded 200,000, and mind you, those were only the remote territories.  Do you honestly think the Japanese were going to bend over and spread their arses when it came to the home islands?</p>
              <p>Really, if you're going to make big claims, make sure you get your facts right first, okay pumpkin?</p>

              <p>While I don't agree with Ged's pumpkin here, I'd beg to differ on this issue.</p>

              <p>The "fighting spirit" is debatable. But ultimately if you cut off their supplies and continue carpet bombing, spirit, fighting or not is not going to save you.</p>

            <div class='col-md body'>
              <p>Thanks for the reference to Weber's essay.  I believe I've encountered that before.  </p>
              <p>I agree that the atomic bombs were unnecessary IF all that was sought was a Japanese surrender.  As Weber pointed out, the Americans and British were after the "unconditional surrender" of Japan.  Whether the terms of the surrender were eventually the same is not relevant. </p>
              <p>Herein lies the a rather philosophical aspect of "victory" and "defeat" and its application on Japan.  Firstly, Pearl Harbor was still freshly etched on American minds.  It was considered to be a sudden attack with no declaration of war, giving the defenders no opportunity to prepare for battle.  It was a departure from the accepted norms of a formal declaration of war.  Secondly, the Japanese also demanded "unconditional surrender" from its enemies; namely the British over Singapore. </p>
              <p>The rules they were laying down on Japan was its own rules it laid out at the beginning of the war.  The "Victors" offer the terms;  the "vanquished" shall accept the terms.  Hence, from a military-political perspective, Japan's offering of terms is unacceptable.  If Japan chooses to surrender, it will do so unconditionally and without terms because it is the vanquished, not the victor.  There is no denying that there was a "satisfaction" of vengeance involved, but those were the rules that Japan set out with.  As far as the U.S. and Britain was concerned, they were playing within the rules Japan began with.  Hence, until Japan surrenders unconditionally (by its own rules), the Allies would continue to bomb and escalate the violence. </p>
              <p>Another perspective is that Japan by that time was completely helpless.  It had no way to strike back at the U.S or Britain.  Nor could it take down the bombers that flew over head.  Because they had no power to strike back with, they also had no leverage or bargaining power against the Allies.  However, despite that the lack of ability to threaten the Allies, it had not surrendered unconditionally.  Hence escalated violence was viewed to be necessary in order to coerce them down that path.  And to demonstrate the promise of "prompt and utter" destruction unless they surrendered unconditionally, the atomic bombs were dropped on Japan, selecting civilian population as primary targets.</p>
              <p>When we look back at the Hiroshima and Nagasaki bombing, we criticize it as barbaric and a violation of human rights and the conduct of war. However, the second World War also marked and ushered in the era of strategic bombing.  Then, the prevalent thought was that a strategic air force, would be able to bomb the enemy into submission, targeting military, industrial and civilian centers to break the enemy's will to fight.  That was how strategic bombing was viewed and used. The atomic bombs were simply an extension to strategic bombing; a bigger and fiercer bomb.  </p>
              <p>With the above plausible explanations,  I disagree with Weber's dismissal of the Allies policy of unconditional surrender as merely a desire for vengeance.</p>

              <div class="quote_body">
              <p>Thanks for the reference to Weber's essay.  I believe I've
              encountered that before.  </p>
              <p>I agree that the atomic bombs were unnecessary IF all that was
              sought was a Japanese surrender.  As Weber pointed out, the
              Americans and British were after the "unconditional surrender" of
              Japan.  Whether the terms of the surrender were eventually the
              same is not relevant. </p>
              <p>Herein lies the a rather philosophical aspect of "victory" and
              "defeat" and its application on Japan.  Firstly, Pearl Harbor
              was still freshly etched on American minds.  It was considered
              to be a sudden attack with no declaration of war, giving the
              defenders no opportunity to prepare for battle.  It was a
              departure from the accepted norms of a formal declaration of war.
               Secondly, the Japanese also demanded "unconditional
              surrender" from its enemies; namely the British over
              Singapore. </p>
              <p>The rules they were laying down on Japan was its own rules it
              laid out at the beginning of the war.  The "Victors" offer the
              terms;  the "vanquished" shall accept the terms.  Hence,
              from a military-political perspective, Japan's offering of terms is
              unacceptable.  If Japan chooses to surrender, it will do so
              unconditionally and without terms because it is the vanquished, not
              the victor.  There is no denying that there was a
              "satisfaction" of vengeance involved, but those were the rules that
              Japan set out with.  As far as the U.S. and Britain was
              concerned, they were playing within the rules Japan began with.
               Hence, until Japan surrenders unconditionally (by its own
              rules), the Allies would continue to bomb and escalate the
              violence. </p>
              <p>Another perspective is that Japan by that time was completely
              helpless.  It had no way to strike back at the U.S or Britain.
               Nor could it take down the bombers that flew over head.
               Because they had no power to strike back with, they also had
              no leverage or bargaining power against the Allies.  However,
              despite that the lack of ability to threaten the Allies, it had not
              surrendered unconditionally.  Hence escalated violence was
              viewed to be necessary in order to coerce them down that path.
               And to demonstrate the promise of "prompt and utter"
              destruction unless they surrendered unconditionally, the atomic
              bombs were dropped on Japan, selecting civilian population as
              primary targets.</p>
              <p>When we look back at the Hiroshima and Nagasaki bombing, we
              criticize it as barbaric and a violation of human rights and the
              conduct of war. However, the second World War also marked and
              ushered in the era of strategic bombing.  Then, the prevalent
              thought was that a strategic air force, would be able to bomb the
              enemy into submission, targeting military, industrial and civilian
              centers to break the enemy's will to fight.  That was how
              strategic bombing was viewed and used. The atomic bombs were simply
              an extension to strategic bombing; a bigger and fiercer bomb.
               </p>
              <p>With the above plausible explanations,  I disagree with
              Weber's dismissal of the Allies policy of unconditional surrender
              as merely a desire for vengeance.</p>

              <p> </p>
              <p>Your points are all valid. And to an extent I do agree with atomic being a bombing of an extension to the strategic bombing.</p>
              <p>However there was one significant difference. "Normal" bombing did not target civilian areas. The atomic bomb, whether on purpose on not, did end up wiping out the entire city. And it's not as though it's a military city like Eglin AFB/Nellis AFB, or even one of the Saudi airbases.</p>
              <p>You could, on the other hand agree that bombing of Dresden set a precedent of targeting civilians (some say civilians were not targeted,  I beg to differ).</p>
              <p>However, I personally believe that if Japan's "normal" surrender was rejected, and strategic bombing continued, an unconditional surrender would come. I do not think all Japanese had a suicidal tendency and were willing to starve to death.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Take note that I'm not against the use of the atomic bomb. I don't see it as a "necessary evil". I see it as a strategic weapon, to be employed when needed. The loss of life has been regrettable, but if employed well, nuclear weapons will be cheaper than conventional weapons. It also has the shock effect none other has.</p>

              <p>I don't really go with that proposal, Chan.  Weber himself acknowledged:</p>
              <p>1) The Americans dropped 1700 tons of bombs on Tokyo.  The Japanese didn't surrender.</p>
              <p>2) The Americans dropped 4500 tons of bombs on Tokyo.  The Japanese still
              didn't surrender.</p>
              <p>3) The Americans dropped Fat Boy on Hiroshima.  The Japanese still
              didn't surrender.</p>
              <p>The pattern's there, mate.  Anyone who claims the Japs were "going to surrender anyway" is dreaming.  They needed to be told not once, but twice, with nuclear weapons that it was time to call it quits.</p>

              <p>Don't know where you get your information, sport, but you need
              to start looking somewhere else.  In preparation for the
              invasion of Japan's home islands, MacArthur's own staff did their
              calculations twice and came up with a figure of more than 100,000
              casualties for the invasion of Kyushu.  Note that this figure
              does not include the invasion of Honshu.</p>
              <p>Frankly, I think the 100K figure was optimistic.  As it is,
              in the preceding year, the casualty figure for the fighting in Iwo
              Jima, Okinawa, Luzon, Peliliu and the Marianas exceeded 200,000,
              and mind you, those were only the remote territories.  Do you
              honestly think the Japanese were going to bend over and spread
              their arses when it came to the home islands?</p>

              <p>yes, i read about how the Japs still have 1 or 2 million men to defend Japan and got thousands of planes for kamikaze and the Aliies thought it'll take at least 1946-7 to conquer the Japs !</p>
              <p>but there's no need to attack the Japs at all ! their navy is gone and they need to import oil, steel and other important materials and how are they gonna do that when they're blockaded and their merchant fleet also sunk?</p>
              <p>the Aliies can just starve the Japs into surrendering just like what the Germans tried to do to the British by attacking their merchant ships.</p>
              <p>don't forget theJaps started the war becoz they need the materials in the 1st place.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>no doubt the Atom Bomb ended the war more quickly - just that instead of soldiers dying, the civilians took over that job.</p>
              <p>the Atom Bomb is to strike fear into everyone in the world not to end the war ! if they want to end the war with the atom bomb, they could just bomb a sparsely-populated place to show its power without having to kill so many civilians.</p>

              <p>On the contrary, "strategic bombing" includes the target of civilians as a doctrine in the period of its birth.  To quote Stanley Baldwin, who served the third time as Britain's Prime Minister from 1935-1937, "The bomber will always get through... the only defense is in offense, which means that you have to kill more women and children more quickly than the enemy if you want to save yourselves."</p>
              <p> Another note is that it is argued that strategic bombing was more effective at causing civilian casualties than leveling military and industrial targets.  </p>
              <p>In hindsight, we can believe that Japan would have eventually succumbed to strategic bombing.  However, given the ferocity of the Japanese defenders on the outer islands and the Philippines, the American military command had no reason to believe that the Japanese would choose surrender unconditionally without escalating the level of violence.  The policy of war is to hit harder and harder until the other side agrees to your terms and bends to your will.  To slacken or show no resolve to raise the level of violence would work to strengthen the enemy's resolve to resist and lengthen the war.  Ironically, the Americans had to relearn the lesson in Vietnam. </p>
              <p>The demonstration of the will to fight, and / or the attack on the will to fight is imperative in war.  The Doolittle raid wasn't necessary.  It did little material damage to Japan at the expense of 16 bombers and their crew.  However, it signaled to Japan the American will to resist and retaliate against Japan.  At the end of the day, the war and the violence is an extension of policy and the exercise of the ability and will to impose one state's policy on another. Hence, the will and ability to impose or resist such imposition (aka "fighting spirit") is pretty much at the center of war.</p>
