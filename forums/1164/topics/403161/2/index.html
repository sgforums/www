              <p>Not everything Patton said was right, dragg, but this quote certainly is.</p>
              <p>Your job is in fact <span style="text-decoration: underline;">not</span> to die for your country. </p>
              <p>Sure, if your happen to crash into the other guy and take him out, you might get a posthumous medal and a pint raised in your name, but you would equally would have done your job if you had taken the other guy out while still staying alive.</p>
              <p>Even better, if you take yourself out without killing any of the other side's guys, all you've done is reduce your own manpower for zero gain.</p>
              <p>So yeah, whichever way you cut it, Patton was right.</p>

              <p>What rubbish!</p>
              <p>The fact that this video exists illustrates the sad reality that
              most Japanese only think of themselves as victims rather than
              perpetuators of the war and the atrocities they committed. This
              video is another sign of that complex. Current day Japanese suffer
              from some kind of amnesia, a result of a misguided education
              system. They can better learn from the Germans. Look, are the
              Germans worse off after they admitted to the truth of their

              <p>I am so "glad" that there are so many "experts" in history willing to make comments without arguments and references against the facts and viewpoints that have been academically studied by professors who have devoted their lives to its study.  Maybe these experts should engage in more academic approaches to their views of Japan during the second world war and provide their account of Japan's role in World War 2 with good arguments and references.  </p>
