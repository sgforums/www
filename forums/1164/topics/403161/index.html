              <p>What rubbish!</p>
              <p>The fact that this video exists illustrates the sad reality that most Japanese only think of themselves as victims rather than perpetuators of the war and the atrocities they committed. This video is another sign of that complex. Current day Japanese suffer from some kind of amnesia, a result of a misguided education system. They can better learn from the Germans. Look, are the Germans worse off after they admitted to the truth of their past?</p>

              <p>Note I am not an apologist for Imperial Japan, I am fully aware of the excesses perpetuated by its military.</p>
              <p>We need to note that for every evil Kempeitai officer, there is also a private who just wanted to get the war over and done with and go home to his family.</p>

              <p>Some thoughts of kamikazes before they died.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>To Masanori and Kiyoko,<br><br>Your father cannot be seen to your eyes, but he is always watching over you. Listen well to what mother tells you and don't make her worry. And when you grow up, take any profession you like, and become a respectable Japanese citizen. Don't be envious of your friends' daddies. Your Daddy, Masanori and Kiyoko, has become a god and is always watching you. You two study hard, and help your mother with her chores too. Masanori and Kiyoko, Daddy can't play horse with you anymore, but you two chum up and hang close to each other.<br><br>Your Daddy was a jolly fellow who got on board a big heavy bomber and wiped out the enemy. You two grow up and be as strong as Daddy, and please avenge my death.<br><br>From Father</p>
              <p>Lt. Col. Masanobu Kuno, Third Independent Kokutai, KIA 5/24/'45 at age 29<br>The will was written for his children, five and three years old.</p>
              <p>I felt the moment of transition from life to death approaching me minute by minute. I gave up my effort to sleep and let my thoughts wander around. My short life of 21 years is going to switch to the world of death tommorrow. Some vague thoughts about my soul being enshrined in Yasukuni Shrine, about the incomprehensive world of death, and other thoughts came and went. I thought thee were more things I wanted to do in my life, but then I wasn't sure what it was that I wanted to do. I didn't know what, but I was certain there was still much that I had left to do here. I felt embarassed to realize that I was still so attached to life after all this time. What a coward! Shame on myself!<br><br>I would say to myself "So are you ready now?" and there was a self that would answer " Yes sir! I'm ready to go", but there was still another self who never stopped yelling "I don't want to die!"</p>
              <p><br>Goro Nagamine, pilot of the H8K flying boat that flew as pathfinder for the Azusa Special Attack unit which struck the US fleet in the evening of March 11th, 1945, writes about his feelings the night before the mission.<br></p>

              <p>What rubbish!</p>
              <p>The fact that this video exists illustrates the sad reality that most Japanese only think of themselves as victims rather than perpetuators of the war and the atrocities they committed. This video is another sign of that complex. Current day Japanese suffer from some kind of amnesia, a result of a misguided education system. They can better learn from the Germans. Look, are the Germans worse off after they admitted to the truth of their past?</p>
