My friend was actually ticked off by the trainees minder(a Army woman WO) because she thought he was a trainee teacher (he was not) and he was snapping pics. He actually ticked her off back and then further embarassed her later when he told the WO off for  letting some of her charges lean against the aircraft exhibits despite the words "No step" and "No push" painted all over the planes.<br><br>Priceless was the look on the WOs face!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"></div>
