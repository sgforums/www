            <div class='col-md body'>Actually IIRC Israeli wanted their EL/M-2052 ASEA radar to be installed in their new F-16I (Israeli Blk52+) at the production line, but the US govt and the manufacturer do not allow it.<br><br>In fact, US has stated that new a/c purchased from them must be installed with their radar, if the user later want to installed a non US radar, the manufacturer will not provide any technical support.<br><br><blockquote>Not on U.S. fighters<br><br>As for potential customers of the new radar, industry officials acknowledged that U.S. government restrictions prevent Elta or its parent company, Israel Aircraft Industries Ltd., from integrating the new radar in U.S. F-16 and F-15 fighters flown by the Israel Air Force. Similarly, the planned U.S. F-35 Joint Strike Fighter is not a candidate for the EL/M 2052, since the Pentagon is insisting that only a home-grown U.S. radar will be offered with the new aircraft.<br><br>Livnat said EltaÂ’s principal focus for the EL/M 2052 is the international fighter upgrade market. He noted that preliminary market forecasts indicate that hundreds of fighter platforms could be made available for significant upgrades over the next 10 years.<br><br>However, Livnat emphasized that Elta is just now beginning to market the new radar, and therefore has no specific customer nation or fighter aircraft within its grasp.<br><br>Â“We donÂ’t want to rule out any platform, since we have experience in adapting our radars to many different platforms. It all depends on the countries that may choose to upgrade existing fleets for the air superiority and advanced strike role instead of purchasing new aircraft,Â” he said.<br><br>When asked about the new Elta radar, a senior executive from Lockheed Martin, prime contractor for the F-16 as well as the planned F-35, insisted that Elta would not be able to offer the EL/M 2052 on any American aircraft without the express approval of U.S. airframe manufacturers and the U.S. government.<br><br>Interviewed during a visit to Israel on March 28, the Lockheed Martin executive said: Â“The Israelis canÂ’t add a radar to their own F-16s or any F-16s on the market, for that matter, without permission from Lockheed Martin and the U.S. government. Without approval to provide the software interface, those aircraft cannot be supported Â… and I seriously doubt that there will be a change in U.S. policy regarding software source codes anytime in the foreseeable future.Â”<br><br></blockquote><a href="http://intellibriefs.blogspot.com/2005/05/first-israeli-designed-aesa-radar.html" rel="nofollow">http://intellibriefs.blogspot.com/2005/05/first-israeli-designed-aesa-radar.html</a><br><br>So unless IAF has by-pass the s/w codes, then RSAF is not buying them for our F-16.</div>
