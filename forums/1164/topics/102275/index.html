            <div class='col-md body'>Interested parties willing to build a new rifle system for the US Army?Read on... :p(Found on the US ARMY TACOM-Picatinny Procurement Network tenders announcement site)Apparently, the XM-8 rifle may be facing some developmentl problesm, which is why they have issued another notice for conceptual planning...<br><br>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br><br>The US Army is currently seeking sources for a Non-Developmental multi- configurable 5.56mm modular weapon system.The system shall consist of four     variants to include:<br><strong>Special Compact (SC),<br>Carbine,<br>Designated Marksman (DM),and<br>Light Machine Gun (LMG) (or Auto Rifle).</strong><br><br>All variants need to function in both semi-automatic and automatic firing modes, with the LMG primary firing mode being full auto. The SC variant will provide Soldiers an enhanced close quarter battle capability providing effective lethality through 150m. The Carbine is slated to be the standard issue individual combat weapon with an effective range  through 500m.The DM variant will provide accurate fire at longer ranges as well as offering an automatic rifle capability.The LMG variant will offer the role of suppressive fire through 600m. The mandatory weapon system family requirements follow.     Any vendor not meeting the following mandatory requirements may not be considered a potential source.<br><br>Multi-Configurable variants/80% parts commonality between SC, Carbine, and DM; 50% parts commonality between LMG and the other three variants; reconfigurable at the unit level.<br><br>Multi-Purpose Sighting System.Each variant shall include a resident     multi-purpose sight that enables the warfighter to rapidly and effectively     engage stationary and moving targets, both with reflexive fire at close ranges,     and with precision fire out to the maximum effective range of the variant (SC- 150m, Carbine-500m, DM-600m, LMG-600m). For close range reflexive fire, the     sight shall enable the warfighter to acquire, engage, and hit a close range     (50m) target in less than 1.5 seconds.<br><br>Accuracy.For soldier fired accuracy: SC (Moving Target) P(H) &gt; .40 at     100m; Carbine (moving target) P(H) &gt; .60 at 150m; DM (stationary w/ 500m zero) P (H) &gt; .50 at 500m; LMG (first 6 round burst against a single E-type silhouette in an 8 target array, zeroed to 300m) P(H) &gt;.04 at 600m.<br><br>Reliability.The Carbine, SC, and DM must demonstrate 18,000 Mean Rounds Between Essential Function Failure (MRBEFF) for Class III malfunctions (i.e., for non-operator correctable malfunctions which cause the loss of essential functionality) and 2,300 MRBEFF for Class I and II malfunctions combined (Class I malfunctions are operator clearable within 10 seconds, whereas Class II malfunctions require more than 10 seconds to clear but can be corrected by the operator with available equipment). The LMG must demonstrate 18,000 MRBEFF for Class III malfunctions and 1,900 MRBEFF for Class I and II     malfunctions combined.<br><br>Back-up sight. Accurately engage targets out to 300 meters without     removal of the MPSS.<br><br>Boresight/Zero Repeatability The weapon system boresight/zero shall be repeated when the OICW (Increment I) Limited Visibility Fire Control is     removed and reinstalled on the weapon.<br><br>Barrel Life.All variants shall have a minimum barrel life no less     than 15,000 rounds. ?<br><br>Ammunition Compatibility. The family of weapons shall use the same     ammunition.     Additionally, all variants must be able to fire standard NATO     issue ammunition (e.g., M855, MK 262). ?<br><br>Ambidexterity. All variants shall be ambidextrous with respect to:     fire mode selector switch, charging handle/forward assist, magazine release,     and bolt catch engagement.     Further, ejected cartridges shall not be channeled     in the rear direction to interfere with left handed shooters.<br><br>Adjustable Stock. The adjustable stock shall accommodate the 5th - 95th percentile warfighter and be rugged enough to withstand the rigors of     individual movement techniques. Desired system attributes include:<br><br>Platform for Area Suppression Lethality Module (ASLM). The system shall provide attachment points for a 40mm grenade launcher.<br><br>Platform for Shotgun Lethality Module (SGLM) ? The system shall provideattachment points for a 12- gauge shotgun.<br><br>Rate of Fire ? Carbine, SC, and DM shall have a maximum effective semi- automatic ROF greater than or equal to 45 rounds per minute without degrading reliability.The LMG sustained ROF in the automatic mode shall be at a minimum of 72 rounds per minute.<br><br>Acoustic, Blast, Flash Suppressor.The flash suppressor of allvariants shall allow for the attachment of an acoustic, flash, and blast  suppressor that can be attached and detached by the operator by hand or with  tools common to the warfighter?s cleaning kit.  All variants shall be capable  of firing with the suppressor attached or detached. The suppressor shall not degrade accuracy.     The flash suppressor shall minimize or eliminate the kick-upand blowback of dirt and dust particles toward the operator.The flash suppressor shall incorporate or act as a muzzle brake. The flash suppressor shall be designed so the operator can perform maintenance and cleaning without the aid of special tools.<br><br>Weight.Weights of each variant should be lower than their comparable     fielded systems. The Carbine shall weigh less than a comparably equipped M4     Modular Weapon System w/M68 Optic, Back Up Iron Sight, and PEQ-2A (8.11lbs). The Designated Marksman shall weight less than a comparably equipped M16 Modular Weapon System, w/4x scope, Back Up Iron Sight, and PEQ-2A (9.39lbs).The Light Machine Gun shall weigh less than an M249 with an M145 Optic (18.5 lbs).<br><br>Limited Visibility Fire Control.All OICW (Increment I) variants (systems) shall incorporate a resident limited visibility fire control with infrared aim light and illuminator.<br><br>Boresight/Zero Retention.The weapon system boresight/zero retentionshall be maintained throughout each mission and while being transported bynormal military means.<br><br>LMG Quick-change Barrel.The LMG shall provide for a quick-change barrel able to be replaced by the operator in under 30 seconds without headspace or timing adjustments while under combat conditions.Due to excessive heat, the LMG barrel shall provide the operator a visible means of determining cautionary heat levels.<br><br>Blank Firing Adapter (BFA). All variants shall be capable of firingblank ammunition with a BFA.<br><br>Length Requirement.The carbine total weapon length shall not be     longer than a fully extended M4 carbine (33.0?).The DM and LMG shall not be     longer than an M16 rifle (39.6?) and M249 SAW (40.75?) respectively.The SC shall take up no more room than a collapsed M4 (29.75?).<br><br>The Government requests that the following accompany any submission. Submissions shall not exceed 50 pages (8 ? X 11?), not including test data. Font shall be 12-pitch with one-inch borders.
