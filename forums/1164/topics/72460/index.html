            <div class='col-md body'><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Singapore fighter trainer runners on starting blocks</span><br><br>Hard on the heels of the three-way fight for Singapore's Next Generation Fighter Replacement programme, set to be decided in about 12 months, the tiny island-state will also soon be in the market for replacements for trainer aircraft to prepare pilots for the new fighter.<br><br>Industry sources say up to seven manufacturers responded to a Republic of Singapore Air Force (RSAF) Request for Information (RFI) issued last February for a new basic trainer aircraft to replace its 30 ageing SIAI Marchelti S211 jets.<br><br>The RFl requested informaÂ­tion on both turboprop and jet basic trainers. Following the US Air Force's change in the late 1990s from T-37 jet to 1-6 Texan turboprop basic trainers, Singapore may also be considÂ­ering the more cost-effective solution of turboprops.<br>Meantime, industry observers also believe the SAF could be issuing an RFI soon for replaceÂ­ments for iis ageing McDonnell Douglas Skyhawk advanced trainer, converted by Singapore Technologies Aerospace to two-seat TA-4SU configuration.<br>The RFI could go out by the end of this year, if the RSAF wants deliveries of the new advanced trainer to coincide with planned arrival in 2008 of the initial batch of next generaÂ­tion fighters.<br>But it is understood that the RSAF's TA-4SUS, some of which<br>are based in Cazaux, France, have had life extension work performed on airframes. The TA-4SU.S are used to transition pilots to all of the RSAF's frontÂ­line fighters - the A-4SU, F- 5E, and F-l 6. Advanced pilot training averages about 100 flying hours.<br><br>The RSAF conducts almost all of its basic training, which<br>averages 100 flying hours, through 130 Squadron, which has been based at KAA1- Pierce in Western Australia since 1991. But a handful of selected Singapore pilots go to the NATO Flight Training in Canada (NFTC] centres at Cold Lake, Alberta, and Moose Jaw, Saskatchewan, for final, Phase 4 advanced training.<br>Because the NFTC uses Bombardier CT-1SS (essentially BAE Systems Hawk MkllS) trainers, industry sources say the Hawk is a front-runner as a replacement advanced trainer. Various versions of the Hawk are currently operational in Malaysia, Indonesia, and Australia.It has been selected by Brunei, pending contract, and ordered by India.<br><br>BAE Systems officials say they will offer the Mkl28 version of the Hawk, the latest, which Bahrain is using, If Singapore requires deliveries before 2008, and the MH29 version if deliveries are required after 2008.<br><br>Meanwhile Aermacchi, which bought the S211 s' maker SIAI Marchetti in 1997, could be offering its new M-346, an extensively redesigned derivaÂ­tive of the Russian Yak-130.<br>The M-346 is considered one of the front-runners for the Eurotrainer competition. It is due to fly around mid-year, and production deliveries should be possible by 2007, just ahead of initial deliveries of Singapore's next generation fighter.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I doubt that RSAF will choose turboprop over jet trainers. After all, if there's a need to replace both the S211 and A4 in the long term, it would make more sense to get a jet trainer like the BAe hawk or M346 for both basic pilot training and AJT as well. But it'll be interesting to see what RSAF shortlists.<br>I guess another cost effective option is a partial privatisation of pilot training, similar to the Airgrading programme in Tamworth ie. leasing the trainers but having Singapore instructors train the pilot trainees.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Pilatus PC 7 for basic trainer - maybe enter into a wet lease arrangement. Better still just ship the trainees off to a school somewhere.<br><br>If really there is a need to replace the TA4S for a fighter trainer - 2nd hand SU25UB Frogfoot.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_eek.gif" alt="Shocked" title="Shocked"><br><br>Actually better solution is to supplement (get more airframes from Royal Saudi Arabia Air Force) and re-use the F5s.<br><br>Suppose it can ride on the T-38C ILS which will go to 2020.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>there's nothing wrong with turboprop aircraft for use in basic pilot training. Afterall, turboprop a/c such as the PC-7, Texan, Harvards have good handling characteristics and thrust compared to some jet trainers. My point though is that if there's a need to replace the S211 for basic training, as well as the A4 for lead-in fighter training, wouldn't it make more sense to get a jet trainer that can fulfill both roles at the same time?<br>Of course there's always the option of just replacing the S211 with a more cost effective turboprop a/c, and then continue using A4s or F5s for AJT, or even leasing jets from BAe or Aermachi to supplement AJT. It'll be interesting to see how RSAF will decide.<br></div>
