            <div class='col-md body'>Singapore`s strategies no longer revolves mainly around Malaysia and Indonesia. It`s not an insult. Singapore has better things to worry about given her newly expanded capabilities. It`s an evolution of years of investment in time, effort and money. It`s a result of changing geo-political dynamics. Where would Asean be if not for Singapore`s balancing act in various areas ? I mean it`s ridiculous thinking how far-fetched this sounds given the disparities in sizes.  It becomes comical just seeing how some countries in this region try to react to Singapore`s shadow. You`d think it does`nt disrupt military plans(of others)..the flip-flopping and all? And you`d think we would want to reveal everything we have ? I dont think that`s far from the truth.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Yes although i agree that SAF is superior in terms of equipment, organisation and communication. We still have our limitations for example as a conscript army our soldiers are less well trained in areas such as jungle survival skills and unarmed combat due to just 2 years of NS. I know for sure that generally their jungle survival skills is definitely better than ours and unarmed combat will definitely take more than 2 years to be proficient, what they are learning now are just the basics.

To some extent, a benign US and lesser powers have allowed that to happen. But a rising China and India is changing that. And now, the threat of militant Islam is complicating issues.<br><br>Hence, Singapore is unabashedly making sure that the US stays here for good, if not the other powers. That would mean helping their stay here in SEA. Such a goal would also be cun-current with Singapore`s own goal of staying on top of both Malaysia and Indonesia.<br><br>In addition, Singapore`s own military would also have to play greater role with the changed variables. It would invariably involve increasing the SAF`s capability to provide calculated and decisive injections of military strength(passive or otherwise) where possible and diplomatic and financial support when not possible. The eventual aim is to ensure that no one dictates anything in SEA; the balance is kept.<br><br>It also means keeping Malaysia and Indonesia under wraps. We stay on top(of the rest) and we`ll be in good shape.<br><br>As an extension of Singapore`s diplomatic goals to engage other powers, expect the SAF to play an even greater role in peace-keeping actions when called upon. Needless to say, it`s not just humanitarian. Countries are not charities.<br><br>There are challenges to the game of the day no doubt. Myanmmar, for one, is annoying. However, we have been playing it well enough. But best not to take it for granted.<br></div>

Conscripts have lived up to expectations and in many cases, did better than most professional armies. Most major wars would involve conscripts anyway.<br><br>At any rate, how do you define conscripts? The conscript forces of Israel, Taiwan, South Korea, for example, can literally 'own' the professional forces of many countries. Will the conscript forces of a particular country which are better educated perform better than one who can barely read? Will the soldiers of a country with a less than a billion USD dollars in budget perform better than the one with better budget? Are you a professional soldier if you are recruited and fight for two years as a professional in the army for a war your country is engaged in and resign after that? Or were you a conscript?<br><br>As you say, the man in the loop matters most; it is how they are trained and used which is critical.<br><br>Also, when life, land and family are at stake, morale takes a life of its own.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>A lot depends on the commander as well.<br>If ur commander panic when the 1st bullet start to fly. no matter how well equipped or trained u r, chances of getting out alife is slim, whereas if ur commander is steady &amp; experience &amp; knows how to motivate his men, a normal unit can sometimes out perform a regular unit.<br><br>My unit OC can do very well in his IPPT, but screwed up whenever we go for execises. Once he put on his helmet &amp; SBO, he can't think! He panic &amp; becomes stone when the action starts. Hope no war happens during my times, if not, probably the whole unit will go up the lorry becos of him.</div>
