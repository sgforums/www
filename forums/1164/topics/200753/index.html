            <div class='col-md body'>July 17, 2006 22:30 PM<br><br>M'sia To Build Two Frigates, Buy Eight Aermacchi Aircraft<br><br>From Ahmad Fuad Yahya<br><br>LONDON, July 17 (Bernama) -- Malaysia plans to build two frigates and purchase eight Aermacchi fighter trainer aircraft to boost efforts to enhance the country's defence capabilities.<br><br>Deputy Prime Minister Datuk Seri Najib Tun Razak said these would be part of discussions with several companies in the defence industry for programmes to be realised under the Ninth Malaysia Plan (9MP).<br><br>He said Malaysia had issued a letter of intent to build the two frigates with BAE Systems and that negotiations were in progress.<br><br>When the two new frigates are built, the Royal Malaysian Navy (RMN) will have four in its arsenal. The RMN now has two -- the KD Lekiu and KD Jebat.<br><br>"Though the specifications are almost the same in terms of their sizes, the defence systems will need to meet our latest requirements," he told Malaysian journalists when visiting the Farnborough International Air Show (FIAS) in Hampshire, outside London, Monday.<br><br>Earlier, he met British Minister for Defence Procurement Lord Paul Drayson and Britain's Head of Defence Export Services Organisation, Alan Garwood.<br><br>Najib, who is also Malaysian Defence Minister, said the government planned to use Sabah Shipyard in Labuan to build the frigates so that it would create job opportunities for Malaysians there.<br><br>The cost had yet to be determined because negotiations had not been completed but the government expected the programme to build the frigates to last about four to five years, he said.<br><br>"We are not looking at it solely in terms of the cost. We also want to see the impact the programme will have on the Malaysian economy as the vessels will be built in Malaysia," he said.<br><br>On the plan to purchase the fighter trainers, Najib said Malaysia planned to buy eight Aermacchi aircraft to add to 10 similar aircraft being used by the Royal Malaysian Air Force (RMAF) for training purposes.<br><br>The purchase was in line with the country's training requirements to produce highly capable RMAF pilots, especially in handling the sophisticated Russian-made Sukhoi fighters that the force was to receive soon, he said.<br><br>On the meeting with Drayson, Najib said the British minister explained to him about the Private Financing Initiatives (PFIs) implemented in the United Kingdom.<br><br>He said he was told that PFIs there were not limited to construction and maintenance of buildings but also involved training and certain services including search and rescue missions.<br><br>Najib, who arrived here yesterday for a week-long visit, is attending the FIAS to scout for the latest defence technologies that may be needed by the country in the future.<br><br>He is expected to meet British Defence Secretary Desmond Brown Monday night.<br><br>-- BERNAMA</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I have an entirely different view of the MAF. The ones I have met are disillusioned and disappointed with the current state of military capability. They are as equally worried about the Thais numerical advantage as they are of Singapore`s technological lead.<br><br>News about the new Lekiu frigates(so-called Block 2 Lekiu) have circulated  years ago. Mentioned no less by thier chief of navy in the critically acclaimed Asian Defence Journal <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"> An artist impression showed a leaner and sleeker ship but not stealthy. They have`nt been made yet though. They are busy with the Mekos.<br><br>Im not sure what kind of weaponry they are going to fit onto the new frigates(which has the same kind of dimension as the current ones); which are more like large corvettes with a heli-pad to me. Aster 30s are impossible to fit in. Aster 15s are slightly shorter so it`s highly unlikely too. There does`nt seem to be enough space. Also, I doubt they will buy anything we buy in missiles as the current trend might suggest. ESSMs and standards are out of the question too. They are going to have problems getting them from the US and paying; not to mention integrating them too.<br><br>Im thinking it will be seawolfs again or Sea-Rams(if they ever go around negotiating and buying them from the US) plus <strong>Exocet Block 3s</strong>. That would give Singapore a valid excuse to get something better though.<br><br>If the purchase goes through(if ever!!!), it would not mean an increase in inventory. They`re are replacing old ones which they ought to have retired years ago. Our ships(minus subs..<img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink">) are relatively very very young compared to thiers.<br><br>Why don`t they finish the Meko project first before going around to build new frigates and in East Malaysia to boot ? It`s just messy. Also, I understand they have financial constraints but if you`re getting just two more frigates, get something which outclasses the Formidables to even out the odds a bit. It`s baffling just digesting the kind of decisions that are made up north.<br><br>They certainly have a large number of trainers vis-a-vis fighter planes.<br><br>Anyone counting the days to the actual decision to buy the frigates and build them in reality?</div>
