If the Fokker attacks at 20,30nm,it should be safe if there is not air cover for the enemy task force.Are there any strategic SAMs systems on board any of our neighbours? As for your comment about the limited number of Fokkers,half a dozen or so is enough when each aircraft carries two Harpoons and considering the size and competency of the fleets of our neighbours. This is not the Third Battle of the North Atlantic with multi-regiment attacks by Soviet Naval Aviations Backfires against  US Carrier Battle Groups.But then again,there is never too much firepower,only too little.....Hahaha...</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>hmm.......yea Donetiz is correct.The range of the SAM in the reigon is around 30km while the harpoon has an optimal range of some 100km(60Nm)</div>
