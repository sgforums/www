As for .50 cals... Preferably within 500m.<br><br>Besides, the time u take to fire ONE 75mm round,  is enuff for most AFVs to fire a whole volley of their 20mm.  Besides, do u think the AMX-13 can acquire faster than modern IFVs?  Lets not compare with neighbouring vehicles for now.  Which do you think will survive?  Between a Bionix and an AMX-13 firing on the move over rugged terrain.  Chances are, the 75mm will miss, while the BX will plough enuff 25mm slugs thru ur engine block.<br><br>If the armor protection of the vehicle is not able to ensure the survivability of its crew, then u can also throw those "Human operator factors" out the window.</div>
