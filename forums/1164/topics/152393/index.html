            <div class='col-md body'>In cooperation with the Israeli electronics firm Elbit and Nimda, has planned and prepared a prototype up-rated AMX-13 light tank. The IDF had operated some 200 of this type as its first modern tank, received just before the Sinai campaign (1956) and had made several modifications , especially in regard to improving its performance in severe desert conditions. It has been sold to several Asian countries, foremost Singapore . The Israelis had, over the years of its service life (3 AMX-13 battalions took active part in the fighting of the Six Day War in 1967), amassed a large amount of combat and maintenance experience with this vehicle .<br><br>Now this, as well anther expertise, has served well to bring about an excellent, original solution to the problem of modernizing the obsolete AMX-13 light and restoring its service life for modern tank combat, especially for those countries whose economic infrastructure requires tanks of less than 25 ton ,due to restricted bridge-crossing capabilities or limited gauge rail systems for transportation .<br><br>The new combat profile of the Nimda AMX 13 is powered by the DDA-6V- 53 T Diesel engine which produces 275 hp at 2800rpm (the original SOFAM petrol engine produced 240 hp at 3200rpm), and weighs 612 kg .<br><br>A major problem - to refit the tank with its new DDA power train required a modification of the engine, enabling it to be fitted into the restricted engine department space with an angle inclination adapted base produced by the Detroit manufactures and specially designed for the project. The improved automation, which includes a dry type, mechanically actuated clutch and cooling system (a marked improvement ove the original problematic hot climate system which caused much trouble), increases the modernized AMX -13's range by 150 km .<br><br>A dramatic improvement in the tank's combat effectiveness is obtained by the inclusion of the Elbit LANCELOT Fire Control System, which greatly enhances the day or night combat capability, as well as first hit probability, thereby increasing survivability by reducing exposure time ; the original shape and low silhouette gave it excellent hull-down position selection capacity .<br><br>The Elbit LANCELOT system improves the first round hit probability by correcting the relevant systematic errors that occur when firing against stationary or moving targets with the aid of a digital computer , laser rangefinder and second-generation image intensifier. Gunner's day and night sight and an optional commander's control unit enable the crew to function excellently in two-man turret .<br><br>The main armament, originally the 75 mm HV gun (IDF) and up gunned versions, 90 mm (France) or 105 mm (Netherlands), can be retained to function with the modernized system. With long rod ammunition, the armour-piercing performance can be enhanced considerably with high cost effectiveness .<br><br><img src="http://www.israeli-weapons.com/weapons/vehicles/tanks/amx13/amx13_3.jpg"><br><br><img src="http://www.israeli-weapons.com/weapons/vehicles/tanks/amx13/amx13_1.jpg"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>The AMX-13 was a French light tank produced from 1953 to 1985. It served with the French Army and was exported to over twenty-five other nations. Including prototypes and export versions there are over a hundred variants including self-propelled gun, anti-aircraft systems, APCs, and TOW/ATGM versions. It is estimated that total production of the AMX-13 family was 7,700 units, of which around 3,400 were exported<br><br>The tank was designed at the Atelier de Construction d'Issy-les-Moulineaux in 1946 to meet a requirement for an air-portable vehicle to support paratroopers, the first prototype ran from 1948. The compact chassis had torsion beam suspension with five running wheels and two return wheels; the engine runs the length of the tank on the right side with the driver on the left. The uncommon two-part 'oscillating' turret is set to the rear of the vehicle and holds the commander and gunner. The original 75 mm gun, modelled on German designs, was fed with a automatic loading system in two six-round magazines. A weakness of the small size meant the magazines were mounted externally, thus requiring them to be reloaded outside the vehicle.<br><br>Production began at ARE (Atelier de Construction Roanne) from 1952, with the first tanks delivered the following year. In 1964 production was transferred to Creusot-Loire at Chalon-sur-Saone, as the ARE moved to building the AMX 30 MBT, and the numbers produced declined significantly.<br><br>In 1966 the standard gun was increased to 90 mm (the AMX-13/90) and the French upgraded all existing base models to this specification. Although there were many variants on the turret the basic chassis was almost unchnaged until 1985 when changes including a new diesel engine, fully automatic transmission and a new hydropneumatic suspension were introduced.<br><br>Production halted with the Model 1987. After sales support and upgrades are still offered through GIAT Industries.<br><br>The AMX-13 tank was phased out of service with the French Army in the 1970s. Current French light tanks are the ERC 90 Sagaie and the AMX 10 RC.<br><br>[edit]<br>Additional characteristics<br>Ground clearance: 370 mm<br>Fording: 600 mm<br>Vertical obstacle 650 mm<br>Trench: 1.6 m<br>Gradient 60 %<br>Side slope: 60 %<br>NBC system: None<br>Night vision: Optional<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Sabots don't detonate. They just pierce armor.  And things get "heated up" as it goes.<br><br>As the sabots pierce, it gets super heated due to the high velocity and friction with the armor.  This super heated round enters the tank, pretty much cooks everyone inside as well as cook off the rounds in the tank. Sometimes the round itself may break off, and super heated fragments would just fly about inside the tank and hit anyone.<br><br>Prob is, when used on a lightly armored vehicle such as the AMX-13... the chances that the SABOT will fly right thru could be higher.  Reason... well.  The AMX-13's armor too thin to cause much friction to the round, hence it wont get super heated further and fragment.  I believe that air friction to a Mach 4 round might heat it up, but its super heating caused by armor plates thats really the punch factor.<br><br>So what happened to the poor text AMX-13 was, mach 4 hyper velocity projectile pierces its armor, and flew right thru and out the otherside.  Air rushes to fill the vacuum behind the round, and rushes into the tank.  Sudden compression MAY kill crew.   Hence, I'd think HEAT rounds are more effective against AFVs or light tanks such as the AMX-13.  If not, 50.cal.  Save the sabots.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>The sabot acts to stabilise the flight trajectory of the round as it leaves the barrel.    The rounds that hit the target are nothing more than giant nail, usually smaller than the round itself, so the sabot acts in one way as a protective barrier for the round as it is fired and to stabilise its flight after it leaves the barrel.  APFDS rounds are kinetic energy rounds that depend on its exit velocity to penetrate armour.  Those who have seen the 75mm and 25mm ones, they're nothing more than giant nails, really. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"></div>

It uses kinetic energy to penetrate armoured vehicles, and is often referred to as a KE round. A fin stabilised sub-projectile or sub-calibre 'dart' of very dense material such as depleted uranium (APFSDS - DU) or tungsten steel (APFSDS - TS) is fired at very high speed (hyper-velocity). The sub-projectile has a high length to diameter ratio, and is often referred to as a 'long rod penetrator'. By encasing the sub-projectile in a lightweight sabot jacket the sub-projectile is able to be fired from a much larger calibre gun. The sabot in effect 'seals' the space between the barrel lining and the sub-projectile.<br><br>The difference in calibres between the gun barrel and the sub-projectile means that a disproportionate high charge/propellant level to projectile weight/drag occurs. This results in massive energy transfer to the low drag sub-projectile, the sabot ensuring all energy is transfered to the 'dart'.<br><br>The sabot round rapidly attains hyper-velocity in the gun barrel. As the sabot round leaves the muzzle of the gun, the sabot jacket is shed from the sub-projectile 'dart' by its own drag. ....<br><br>to read further go to <a href="http://www.army-technology.com/contractors/ammunition/apfsds.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.army-technology.com/contractors/ammunition/apfsds.htm</a><br><br></div>
