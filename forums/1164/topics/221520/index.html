            <div class='col-md body'>Hi,<br><br>We have seen numerous pics of US planes in formation with foreign jets eg:<br><br>- US A-10 &amp; F-16 in formation with Egyptian F-16, MiG-21 &amp; -15UTI during Exercise Bright Star '82;<br>- USN F-14 in flight with Croatian MiG-21;<br>- USAF F-15C with IAF SU-30.<br><br>So just wondering, does anyone here seen pics of RSAF planes in formation with a foreign military planes?  Esp given the many exercises that the RSAF conducts locally (with visiting allied planes) or overseas exercises (eg, to Thailand, Austalia, France, India, even the US) my recollection doesn't recall me seeing pictures of RSAF planes in formation with a foreign military jet (the only one which I remember seeing is a RSAF KC-135 'refuelling' RAAF F-111s in AirForces Monthly).<br><br>Regardless of the pics are RSAF 'intercepts', transports, choppers etc (btw, the planes MUST have RSAF roudels, US-based RSAF with USAF roundels doesn't count).  If you have, please post share them here.<br><br>Let me start off here with the followng pic as example (with the RMAF prize inventory with a visiting USN F-14);<br><br><img src="http://imagelink.org/image/3702.jpg"></div>

Blanco, President Bush, and all the other obsessions of the the national media combined, which strongly suggests the usual suspects were at best, not central to what happened and at worst, out to lunch.  What really happened with this crew is the subject of another story.<br>I continue to be fascinated by what the Republic of Singapore Air Force represents, namely the total collapse of reporting standards.  Besides getting many of their facts wrong, my former colleagues missed the best damn human interest story I've heard in years.   Pilots I interviewed mentioned sighting such an aircraft or hearing from someone who had. Later, one source who I will avoid naming here to spare embarassment scoffed and thought I made that one up, like other somebody invented baby raping.<br>I told him I'd heard about this mysterious RoS Chinook from one of his pilots, and that I'd found a web site in Texas that confirmed, vaguely, that there was some kind of helicopter that belonged to Singapore in the neighborhood.  And that I'd included the anecdote because it was just too damn juicy to pass up.  I am at heart a professional journalist, and willing to be a touch irresponsible when so moved.<br>As I later found out last week on the Web, the feisty little nation-state does not have enough airspace to run regular training programs for its tiny but world-class air force.   So our allies from Singapore permanently station aircraft with the Texas  National Guard in the U.S. And on any given day several hundred of its citizens, comprised of pilots, maintenance crews, and dependents, reside in the U.S and fly high performance fighters and helicopters for practice.  In what could serve as a metaphor for all the reporting on Hurricane Katrina, even yours truly had underestimated their contribution.  There wasn't a single Republic of Singapore Chinook that brought  those foreign friends to help the Big Easy in its hour of desperate need.  There were four.<br>http://dolinar.com/column/politics/superdome.html</div>
