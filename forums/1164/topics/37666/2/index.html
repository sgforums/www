Crew size is the most significant driver for the cost of a warship over its operational life."<br><br>"While recognising that the US DD(X) program is unlikely to be mirrored here in Australia, the technology developed for the DD(X), particularly that of the combat system, could allow the Australian Navy to make a generational leap for its next major surface combatants."<br><br>Raytheon will be responsible for the total systems engineering, software development, and combat system of the DD(X). In addition, the company will build and test a dual frequency radar suite, an integrated solid-state communications system, an integrated anti-submarine and mine warfare system, a revolutionary vertical launching system, and a multi-mission total system computing environment.<br><br>Mr Fisher said, "Raytheon Australia aims to be the pre-eminent systems integrator in the region; leveraging the technology and R&amp;D base of our parent company to provide leading edge and innovative solutions for naval and aerospace platforms, and command and control systems. W e will continue to work with the Australian Defence Force to ensure that they have access to the most advanced technology and capable systems worldwide."<br><br>In America, Representative Martin T. Meehan a member of the House Armed Services committee, praised the decision saying, "The DD(X) will revolutionise US sea power and Raytheon will be a key provider of leap-ahead technologies."<br><br>Raytheon Australia is a wholly owned subsidiary of Raytheon Company, a global technology leader in defence, government and commercial electronics, and business and special mission aircraft.<br><br>-ends-<br><br><a href="http://www.defense-aerospace.com/data/communiques/archives/2002Aug/data/2002Aug11739/index.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.defense-aerospace.com/data/communiques/archives/2002Aug/data/2002Aug11739/index.htm</a><br><br></div>
