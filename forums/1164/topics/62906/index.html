            <div class='col-md body'>I personally have not seen serious cases of power abuse. However, I must point out that within the system, there is serious potential for power abuse which can go by undetected. Let me give you an example :<br><br>I believe that you guys know that malingering and disobeying orders from superiors are chargeable offences. So is lying to an officer. (WTF, everything is a chargeable offence in the army, so goes the joke among my friends) The thing is, it is all up to the officer whether he want to charge you or not, even for very small things. Malingering, how would one define it? How much laziness would define as malingering? Disobeying orders. Forgeting to carry out a small order would also be "disobeying orders".<br><br>Few months ago, SAF just had a AHM donation exercise. We were all given a target of 21 dollars to raise. ("Strongly encouraged to donate", so were the words said. cannot force, because they scared people complain in papers, which happened) We were not allowed to request donations from the public, but from family and friends. Basically, just want money come out of our own pockets la. In the end, most HAM JI, come out 21 dollars. I refused, and came out with around $3. My officer was a good officer, chose to overlook this case. But in my friends coys, they were pressed, and they knew very well that if they didn't get  21 dollars, will have extra duty la, arrow sure increase. This kind of things, can you tell me its not an abuse of power? Sure, they wont punish you explicitly for not raising the required amount, but they will get you in other ways.</div>

When in army they always say must strike a balance between SAFETY and OPERATIONAL READINESS.<br>i guess by "splashing water on the POW course trainees", (as the original lesson plan states) basic endurance and self-discipline cannot even be achieved, let alone OPERATIONAL READINESS.<br>yes my condolences go out to those who unfortunately died during training while serving their 2 1/2 years...but what is "NS" without accidents occurring??<br>no offence to the public but i do pity those instructors involved..their level of experience should be high and rich enough to successfully conduct such high risks trainings..however it was jus inevitable that such unfortunate incident happened, and it caused them their jobs. Thousands had passed out from the course alive before.<br>SO...WELFARE OR NOT? SAFE OR NOT? RELISTIC TRAINING THEN??? YOU DECIDE</div></blockquote>i guess you are another one who think that the instructors didnt do anything wrong eh?<br>precisely..thousand have pass the course alive..but y only the recent death?<br>it is not inevitable..IT CAN BE PREVENTED!!!<br>basic endurance? its either you got hit on your head or something else..u cant train to be torture...no such thing as getting endurance for torture training..unless you like SM..<br><br>you offended me..i wont quit bashing you..<br>once again i will use the same theory as given by you..y not we implement shooting live round into our NSF..so to train them to endure pain n death.. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>it is hard for NS to be accident free..but we can minimise it..NS can be death free..<br><br>it cause the instructors their job..they deserve it..whats with the pity?<br>they wont accept your pity too...if they are real man wearing the red berets..they will accept this responsibility..<br>who are you to pity them? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>are you gona use your brain..YOU DECIDE!!</div>
