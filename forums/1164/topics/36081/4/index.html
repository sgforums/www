            <div class='col-md body'>Flight International 4-10 March 2003<br>Headlines<br><br>Defence Paul Lewis/Washington DC<br><br><strong>Singapore's JSF move raises A-4 contest fears</strong><br><br>Singapore's decision to join the Lockheed Martin F-35 Joint Strike Fighter (JSF) development programme as a security co-operation participant(SCP) is raising concerns among rival manufacturers that it will overshadow the competitve selection in the near-term of a replacement for the air force's McDonnell Douglas A-4SU Skyhawks by 2007.<br><br>Singapore becomes the 11th nation and the first from the Asia-Pacific region to commit to the JSF.  It has earmarked $50 million, which provides access to data, modeling amd country-unique system studies, but does not give programme office representation.<br><br>While the agreeement to join the system development and demostration(SDD) phase does not commit Singapore to ordering the F-35, its defence ministry acknowledges "JSF is a potential candidate to meet Republic of Singapore Air Force's longer-term operational requirements for a multirole fighter".  This concerns some companies expecting to bid for Singapore's 18-24 aircraft A-4SU replacement programme.<br><br>Observers say Lockheed Martin's hopes of selling Singapore additional F-16C/D Block 52s would be boosted if the nation were to defer a decision on adding anotehr aircraft before the F-35 is ready. Singapore already operates 49 f-16s and will begin taking delivery of another 20 Block 52s from December.<br><br>JSF has already undermined fighter competitions in Australia and Netherlands, which have both joined SDD.  Singapore's long-term goal is toreduce the number of different fighters in the air force's fleet from the current F-16, A-4SU and upgraded Northrop Grumman F-5S/T to just two types.<br><br>Rival manufacturers are pinning their hopes from Singapore needing a more modern air superiority fighter and the F-35 being available for export before 2015.<br><br>Contenders include Boeing F-15T and F/A-18E/F Super Hornet, Dassualt Rafale, Eurofighter Typhoon, F-16C/D Block 60 and Suhkoi Su-35.  Singapore is to expected to shortlist two to three aircraft in May before issuing a request for proposals and Marketing final fighter selection in February next year.</div>

That leaves 61.<br><br>Take away 23(1 lost) based in the US. That leaves 38 in Singapore after the 20 are delivered. Not exactly 1 for 1 anymore is it?   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br>The lease-to-buy arrangement was for the 1996 batch. While there has been no official confirmation of the purchase, I know from a friend in Aust who saw them 1st hand that at least one of the 5 Pitch Black Vipers wore a 1996 serial. I don't think the RSAF would being back a leased a/c when there are those in the US that we've bought right?<br><br>I really don't know, or want to comment on the NGF anymore, I personally will just sit back and watch events unfold   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>
