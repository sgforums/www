            <div class='col-md body'>Its NOT as simple as landing a VTOL on an LST an VOILA! You get an aircraft carrier, guys. First of all, can the flight deck handle the weight of the fighter? I doubt that the flight deck was built with the possibility of handling a plane in mind. <span style="font-style: italic;">Even</span> if the flight deck <span style="font-style: italic;">could</span> handle a plane, does the ship have the facilities to sustain and maintain the plane? You cannot just upgrade the ships facilities to handle a plane.
