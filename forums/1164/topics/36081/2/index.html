Its stealth (which for the conventional and naval version will approach the higher limits of the Raptor's, as claimed by L-M engineers) will give it a huge advantage over any conventional fighter. Its range (which will be substantially more than any fighter of its class, due to its very large internal fuel capacity) will give it long endurance in CAP missions. Its avionics, which are integrated (though to a slightly less extent than the F-22's, for the sake of easing future upgrading of the avionics system) will allow it comprehensive situational awareness of the battlespace, giving it the vaunted "first look-first shot-first kill" capability.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Has anybody thought about the implication of the signing of the letter of intent on the forthcoming order for the replacement of the remaining A4s?<br>Here's my take on this issue. Lockheed Martin may end up a loser in this case, at least in the short to medium term. Reason, you may ask?<br>Currently they are promoting the F16C/D Blk 60. Comparing to our current version, and the F-35 when it enters service in 2008 (For US service only), this plane is right in the middle in terms of capability (est.) and technology. By signing the letter of intent, RSAF will unlikely want to put all its eggs in one basket, all our aircraft coming from the US, and from the same manufacturer at that, Lockheed Martin!  I have nothing against LM, but there may be obstacles and snags whenit comes to technology transfer as in the past over the mission computer of the F16.<br>IMHO, the F15 is too expensive (for such an old design), and the SBug, well, too many negative comments to even list it here (I may be wrong though). SU-30, forget about it.<br>Thus, the only candidates worth looking into it, are the Typhoon and the Rafale. Comments anybody?<br><br>BTW, I think the next gen. aircaft will not only replace the remaining A4s, but at least 1 squadron of the F5s, if the options are taken up with delivery of the 1st 20 or so in 2007~9, with the 2nd batch in 2011~12. As the F-35 for export customers will only be available in 2012 (according to journals like Flight INt'l), the RSAF will most likely get theirs in 2015~17, replacing the remaining F5s plus the F16A/Bs, and then gradually the F16C/Ds after 2020.<br><br></div>
