I would take the sentence meaning that other than Taiwan there is a counry called Singapore, whose though has has a first rate military force, but due to our ethic chinese majority, were are just No Action Talk Only.<br><br>I seriously hope the writer would have relavant information regarding the state of our Armed Forces before making such a statement.<br><br>With regards to the professional and conscript question.me and Gedekan did have a small PM session regarding such a force. I agree with him that a professional army standard is higher. The level of training and focus can be greater as the soldier is bonded by the army's demands and policies. Being a volunteer, he has a positivie thinking and motivated to begin with. Not some negative NS is bullsxxt,crap kinda of nosenses. in a nut shell u can't compare an orange with an apple.<br><br>I was posed the same question couple of times over in the country i am studing. The locals ask whether was the SAF on terms and par with their regular army. Some of them in mockingly manner even. I just asked them if they ever wanted to be conscripted in the army doing what a soldier does if not u lose ur citzenship and jail..most of them just looked like a complete noob, even saying they have better things to do than to be in the armed forces. Well i think that was suffice to knock some senses into their already slack mentality.<br><br>lastly i hope the sentence highlighted in red was meant something else......<br><br></div>

In addition, they also have what they call Tactical Assault Groups, one based in the east and one in the west. You could probably compare these to our SOF. then of course there's their SASR as well.<br><br>so yeah, while their army is small, they certainly punch above their weight, methinks.</div>
