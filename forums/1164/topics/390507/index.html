              <p>We have seen a great deal of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles in recent operations. In the recent Airshow too, with technology we can reduce risking our pilots on dangerous missions.</p>
              <p>The United States has launched some 40 UAV-carried missile attacks inside Pakistan alone last year. Whereas British forces are relying increasingly on unmanned drones to attack targets in Afghanistan, mirroring controversial tactics used by the US.</p>
              <p>They are launched near areas of combat but are then "flown" by remote control, via satellite links, operated by pilots who may be thousands of miles away.</p>
              <p>The drone revolution addresses two urgent requirements for today's military:</p>
              <p>From BBC:<br><strong>There is no risk of your pilots dying</strong></p>
              <p>Pilotless planes promise to be cheaper to make and run than conventional fighter jets <br>The US military already has over 7,000 unmanned aerial systems, and the RAF is following in its wake.</p>
              <p>The RAF's 39 Squadron flies Reaper drone missions over Afghanistan from the Nevada base. The US authorities refused a BBC request to visit, but we were able to speak to RAF personnel there by phone.</p>
              <p>Andy Baverstock analyses the images beamed back from the Reapers' cameras. He describes his team's advanced situational awareness as they watch intently what's happening in Afghanistan.</p>
              <p>"Because you're doing it for so long, you can tell whether a group of people are moving tactically or whether it's a group of guys going to irrigate a field."</p>
              <p><strong>Ethics</strong></p>
              <p>How do they decide whether to use lethal force when they are so far from the battlefield? Wing Commander Jules Ball replies that they often respond to requests for support from soldiers on the ground.</p>
              <p>Otherwise, "we would most definitely be having to go to higher headquarters in order to ensure that what we were doing was appropriate, necessary, proportional and legal. We wouldn't be doing it autonomously if you like from 8,000 miles away".</p>
              <p>It is not just the military who fly drones.</p>
              <p>The CIA uses them to attack al-Qaeda and Taliban targets, sometimes on the territory of Pakistan, a US ally.</p>
              <p>The US government believes drones enable it to strike back at terrorist leaders where conventional forces have failed. Pakistani media have reported hundreds of civilian deaths in such attacks.</p>
              <p>CIA operations like this require presidential authorisation. According to the New America Foundation, a think tank, President Obama has been authorising drone strikes at a higher rate than President Bush.</p>
              <p>Such is the secrecy surrounding CIA operations that there are no clear rules of engagement. There is "no accountability after the fact" says Philip Alston, UN special rapporteur on extra-judicial executions.</p>
              <p>Vicki Divoll, who worked for several years as a CIA lawyer, refuses to confirm that such attacks happen as reported. But based on "what we believe to be happening," she reveals deep divisions within the CIA about the use of drones.</p>
              <p>Using drones to kill people has been "extremely controversial" at the agency, she says.</p>
              <p>"When the controls are manned by someone in a suburb of Washington rather than by someone in the field you become so detached that there's no cost, there's no limitation on you."</p>
              <p>The implications of the robotic revolution are profound.</p>
              <p>The US is already recruiting drone pilots from among young men skilled at computer games. Instead of flying into danger they may never need to leave the security of a cabin full of computer screens on home soil.</p>
              <p>Will this revolution change attitudes towards killing and make governments feel war is less costly or risky?</p>
              <p>Air Vice Marshal Tim Anderson, trained in British military tradition, has his concerns.</p>
              <p>But he hopes that responsibility for combat will still "imbue within operators an appropriate sense of culture and ethos, such that it never becomes a video game".</p>
              <p>What does it mean for the British pilot Mark Jenkins, based in Nevada, when he kills people remotely?</p>
              <p>"It's going to weigh on your mind. It does. I don't think you'd be human if it didn't. But I've got a family at home and I need to be there for my family, so I deal with it."</p>

              Israel unveils huge drones that can reach Iran 
              
              http://images.smh.com.au/2010/02/22/1151492/st_drone2-420x0.jpg
               
              Israeli soldiers look at an IAI Eitan, also known as the Heron TP, surveillance unmanned air vehicle. 
              
              Israel's air force has introduced a fleet of huge pilotless planes that can remain in the air for a full day and fly as far as the Persian Gulf, putting rival Iran within its range.
              
              The Heron TP drones have a wingspan of 26 metres, making them the size of Boeing 737 passenger jets and the largest unmanned aircraft in Israel's military. The planes can fly at least 20 consecutive hours and are primarily used for surveillance and carrying diverse payloads.
              
              At the fleet's inauguration ceremony at a sprawling air base in central Israel, the drone dwarfed an F-15 fighter jet parked beside it. The unmanned plane resembles its predecessor, the Heron, but can fly higher, reaching an altitude of more than 12,000 metres, and remain in the air longer.
              
              "With the inauguration of the Heron TP, we are realising the air force's dream," Brigadier General Amikam Norkin, head of the base that will operate the drones, said on Sunday. "The Heron TP is a technological and operational breakthrough."
              
              Israeli officials refused to say how large the new fleet was or whether the planes were designed for use against Iran, but stressed it was versatile and could adapt to new missions. The plane's maker, state-owned Israel Aerospace Industries, has said it is capable of reaching the Persian Gulf, which would put Iran within its range.
              
              "The Heron TP has the potential to be able to conduct new missions down the line as they become relevant," said Major General Ido Nehushtan, commander of Israel's air force.
              
              Israel believes Tehran is trying to develop nuclear weapons and has repeatedly hinted it could strike Iran if diplomatic efforts to curb the nuclear program fail.
              
              Israeli defence officials said the Heron TP could be a useful tool against Iran, whose leaders have repeatedly called for the Jewish state's destruction. In addition to providing surveillance, the aircraft can jam enemy communications as well as assist in communications between ground control and manned air force planes.
              
              The officials requested anonymity because they were discussing sensitive military technology.
              
              The Heron TP has been in development for about a decade. The aircraft first saw action during Israel's offensive against Hamas militants in the Gaza Strip just over a year ago.
              
              Palestinian witnesses have long claimed Israeli drones fire missiles in Gaza, both before and during the Israeli offensive. Israel has never confirmed its unmanned aircraft can fire missiles.
              
              Israel first began using drones in the early 1970s, and its fleet has steadily increased since then. The unmanned planes are now considered an integral part of the military and tend to accompany air and ground forces on various missions.

              <p>Unmanned weapons systems will probably be quite common in the foreseeable future. Also, by leveraging on technological advances manning levels are progressively being reduced on existing platforms -  look at the latest RSN warships, artillery systems etc. Increasingly, weapons will be operated remotely but a human will still be required in the decision loop.</p>
              <p>As for the infantryman &amp; he will remain the primary source of cannon fodder for still a long way to come - the starship trooper will still be needed for the next millenium.   </p>

              <p>Israel’s air force has introduced a fleet of huge pilotless planes that can remain in the air for a full day and fly as far as the Persian Gulf, putting rival Iran within its range.</p>
              <p>The Heron TP drones have a wingspan of 26 metres, making them the size of Boeing 737 passenger jets and the largest unmanned aircraft in Israel’s military. The planes can fly at least 20 consecutive hours and are primarily used for surveillance and carrying diverse payloads.</p>
              <p>At the fleet’s inauguration ceremony at a sprawling air base in central Israel, the drone dwarfed an F-15 fighter jet parked beside it. The unmanned plane resembles its predecessor, the Heron, but can fly higher, reaching an altitude of more than 12,000 metres, and remain in the air longer.</p>
              <p>“With the inauguration of the Heron TP, we are realising the air force’s dream,” Brigadier General Amikam Norkin, head of the base that will operate the drones, said on Sunday. “The Heron TP is a technological and operational breakthrough.”</p>
              <p>Israeli officials refused to say how large the new fleet was or whether the planes were designed for use against Iran, but stressed it was versatile and could adapt to new missions. The plane’s maker, state-owned Israel Aerospace Industries, has said it is capable of reaching the Persian Gulf, which would put Iran within its range.</p>
              <p>“The Heron TP has the potential to be able to conduct new missions down the line as they become relevant,” said Major General Ido Nehushtan, commander of Israel’s air force.</p>
              <p>Israel believes Tehran is trying to develop nuclear weapons and has repeatedly hinted it could strike Iran if diplomatic efforts to curb the nuclear program fail.</p>
              <p>Israeli defence officials said the Heron TP could be a useful tool against Iran, whose leaders have repeatedly called for the Jewish state’s destruction. In addition to providing surveillance, the aircraft can jam enemy communications as well as assist in communications between ground control and manned air force planes.</p>
              <p>The officials requested anonymity because they were discussing sensitive military technology.</p>
              <p>The Heron TP has been in development for about a decade. The aircraft first saw action during Israel’s offensive against Hamas militants in the Gaza Strip just over a year ago.</p>
              <p>Palestinian witnesses have long claimed Israeli drones fire missiles in Gaza, both before and during the Israeli offensive. Israel has never confirmed its unmanned aircraft can fire missiles.</p>
              <p>Israel first began using drones in the early 1970s, and its fleet has steadily increased since then. The unmanned planes are now considered an integral part of the military and tend to accompany air and ground forces on various missions.</p>

              <p>well the day will come when we no longer need pilots.....war will be over when the command and control system are destroyed.</p>
              <p>But in order to counter such attack, C &amp; C will need to be beyond reach by UAV. Comand and Control system need to be self aware than we have terminator......</p>
              <p>Thats it.....</p>

              <p><strong>PESHAWAR: An al Qaeda-linked militant who has called for attacks on China over its treatment of Muslims has been killed in a US missile strike in Pakistan, Pakistani intelligence and Taliban officials said on Monday.</strong></p>
              <p>China, a close ally of Pakistan, is worried about the spread of violence from militant strongholds in northwest Pakistan to its troubled far western Xinjiang region.</p>
              <p>Abdul Haq al-Turkistani, leader of a group called the Turkistani Islamic Party (TIP), was killed in an attack by a US drone aircraft in the North Waziristan region on the Afghan border on Feb. 15, they said.</p>
              <p>“Abdul Haq al-Turkistani was among three militants killed,” said a Pakistani intelligence agency official who declined to be identified.</p>
              <p>A Taliban militant official also said al-Turkistani had been killed in the US missile strike.</p>
              <p>Last year, al-Turkistani appeared in a video on an Islamist website calling for Chinese people to be attacked at home and abroad.</p>
              <p>“Their men should be killed and captured to seek the release of our brothers who are jailed in Eastern Turkistan,” al-Turkistani, sitting with an assault rifle by his side, said last year, referring to the region by an old name.</p>
              <p>Described by an al Qaeda-linked website as the leader of TIP, he accused China of committing “barbaric massacres” of Muslims.</p>
              <p>Xinjiang is home to 8 million Uighurs, a Turkic, largely Islamic people who share linguistic and cultural bonds with central Asia. Many resent a growing Han Chinese presen</p>

            <div class='col-md body'>There should be drastic change in RSAF.  It should invest less on pilots training and buying new fighter jets.  Since drones have been effectively use in Iraq, Afghanistan, Pakistan and now South Yemen by US and its allies, RSAF should go for drones training and buying drones.  You don't need a military expert to change course.</div>

              <p>RSAF centralises training <br>Move aims to foster closer camaraderie among personnel<br>Mar 23, 2010</p>
              <p>A NEW centralised command has been created to streamline the basic training of all Republic of Singapore Air Force (RSAF) soldiers.</p>
              <p>As part of the new thrust, <strong>training programmes will incorporate more use of technology</strong>, while personnel of all ranks will for the first time go through some basic modules together in a bid to foster closer camaraderie.</p>
              <p>New pilots, air traffic controllers and engineers will train together at a facility in Paya Lebar in courses that address both specific vocational needs as well as build core leadership skills.</p>
              <p>This will give leaders an understanding of the various components of the air force and aid their acumen in the battlefield, said Dr Ng Eng Hen, Second Minister for Defence, yesterday, in explaining how the latest restructuring would meet the operational needs of an evolving third generation military.</p>
              <p>Dr Ng, who is also Minister of Education, was speaking at a ceremony to mark the inauguration of the Air Force Training Command (AFTC) in Paya Lebar.</p>
              <p>The latest changes, some of which started last July, come on the back of recent refinements to streamline the RSAF's command structure.</p>
