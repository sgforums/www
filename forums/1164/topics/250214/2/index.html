            <div class='col-md body'>I was thinking MINDEF planners sees the RSN air defence system as a mobile integrated air defence system that can be linked to the RSAF. Remember back in Asia Aerospace exhibition, ST displayed this frigate that can carry 64 VLS on it. Who noes, we might be getting some Navalised SAM eg ASTER-30 or SM-2 missiles. Since the vessels are out at sea, lesser chances the enemy can pinpoint the location. Unlike air-bases on SG. These bases can be easy hit by enemy artillery.</div>

It never comes cheap, and because the ARM will always shoot at the emitter which illuminated its launching plane previously, so lure the ARM away from the old era radar by the decoy is not easy or just impossible if the radar never shots down at 1st place.<br>[/b]</blockquote>IIRC most Harm's don't home on jam.  Jammers emit noise, to drown out and disrupt radar returns, and ARMs don't home on this kinda noise.  Rather than using jammers, there are tactics to use multiple radars from multiple locations , emitting at different intervals to confuse weasels.<br><br>Weaseling is not as simple as popping an ARM at the nearest emitting radar.  There's an art and lots of planning to it.  You can't be sure if that emitting radar you are targeting is not a bait, trying to draw you into a corridor of tracking radars.</div>

ARM is still capable to home on number of types of Jammer.<br><br>As long as the RWR alarms you SAM there and the pilot will shoot his ARM if his RWR happens to be ARM capable. Pilot doesnÂ’t do planning &amp; thinking too much at a supersonic speed and  under constantly high G conditions and  has to face various threats from air or ground all in a while . ThatÂ’s why you put expertise in your RWR, modern RWR will have a processor behind to process unfriendly or neutral signals and a radar database for comparison. If the fighter jetÂ’s main antenna happens to be phase arrayed as well it can bring more details of signals it received to RWR suite. By analyzing such data, the RWR always can present the most likely &amp; dangerous threat to the pilot, if not 100% sure.<br><br>As for multiple radars from multiple locations, if intervals happened, it could well be that the different radars also jam each other. To have multiple radars involved is over kill in cost and resource demanding when you can just upgrade to an one-panel radar like PAC-2Â’s MPQ-53 to do all the tricky multi-radars job.<br></div>
