Probably you may wish to know many Jammers themselves are radar in principle but without receiver. Many types of radar are capable to be jammers by nature. Say, those AESA radars. If the jammer operates in the bandwidth which falls into the ARMÂ’s seeker ranger, why canÂ’t the ARM home on the Jammer?<br>ItÂ’s possible that Jamming signals donÂ’t appear on RWR , but how you so sure it will not be captured by the ARM seeker itself? HarmÂ’s seeker by design covers a much wider range of frequency. The pilot can choose AGM-88 ARMÂ’s other available operation modes if he doesnÂ’t want the ARM being cured by RWR. He can choose Â“ HARM As SensorÂ” mode which let the AGM88Â’s seeker to do its own search of emitting target or Â“Position KnownÂ” mode to pre-emptily fire at the jamming source provided he knows the jamming source from his own sensor fusion or other offboard ELINT/SIGNIT sensors. In Navy, Â“ HARM As SensorÂ” mode is known asÂ” TOOÂ” mode, and Â“Position KnownÂ” mode is called Â“Pre-briefÂ” mode.<br><blockquote>]I'm not in a position to explain why NATO radars are destroyed by friendly ARMs.  But a good clue to what causes this, could be a mis-identification by HTS? I DID hear some rumors regarding this, but not really validated. </blockquote>The mis-ID by HTS incident shows that pilot trust his RWR and shoots once his RWR prompts. If his RWR mis-ID the target then he shoots wrongly.<br><blockquote>Â… Definitely, if its an SA-6 going active, the shot will be taken.  But if its just an ordinary search radar?  It may blip on the RWR, but it may not Alarm.  </blockquote>Make the fact straight here, old generation SA-6 search radar will surely trigger the modern RWR if it detects the target fighter. Do remember, if the SA-6 search radar sees the fighter, the fighterÂ’s own antenna should have received the non agile and single waveform beam from SA-6 radar and modern RWR will alarm it rather than filter it away. If the fighterÂ’s RWR filters the signal, then will be SA-6Â’s receiver. If itÂ’s blip on modern RWR, then itÂ’s blip on SA-6Â’s search radarÂ’s own receiver as well. However, a modern phased array radar doing search may cheat the RWR due to its electronically steered beam can be low power in designated search direction and the phase array radar can use multiple waveform &amp; frequency agile beams to detect the same air target thus without trigger its RWR.<br><blockquote>A SEAD strike mission might see the pilot taunting the battery to turn on their FCR to take a shot, while a SEAD Escort might want to shoot at the search radar anyway.  Much of these also depend on restrictions applied in the operation.</blockquote>Volume search radar being suppressed is just as grove as the FCR being suppressed, How much difference will be to fire one ARM from several ones? A SEAD Su30Mk can carry 6 KH-31P ARM, How difficult is for different SEAD units to brief each other in order to do a coordinated attack?<br><br><blockquote>There were so much restriction placed upon NATO pilots in Allied force, that they prevented planners from deploying desired ELINT,SIGINT assets at the optimal positions to detect the SAM batteries.

Actually itÂ’s quite standard practice for the US force to bring in ELINT/SIGINT asserts in a major SEAD mission. Check here, how a SEAD joint with ELINT/SIGINT took out the IraqÂ’s IADS in 1991 gulf war. Do take note, the then Iraqi IADS were mainly consisted of 2G SAMs lacking of 3G elements like S-300/PAC-2/3<br><br><blockquote><span style="color: blue;"> The Allied assault on Iraq saw the collapse of a formidable integrated air defence system, probably the most lethal outside the Warsaw pact. The Iraqi system had much in common with the Soviet system, including equipment, deployments, operational doctrine and diversity of types. The ease with which the Allies crippled and then demolished this system testifies to fundamental flaws in Warpac air battle doctrine, which would have had a decisive influence in any NATO-Warpac conflict. What follows is how it was done.</span></blockquote></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Continued from last post<br><blockquote><span style="color: blue;">Planning and Preparation<br><br>The Allies had monitored the Iraqi IADS closely throughout the buildup period of Desert Shield, deploying a range of Elint (Electronic Intelligence gathering) assets to the theatre. These assets served the principal purpose of mapping out the Iraqi Electronic Order of Battle (EOoB), ie pinpointing the deployments and composition of Iraq's air defence batteries and supporting radar systems, and mapping out the stations and frequencies used for command and control of the network.<br><br>Key systems employed were various subtypes of the EC/RC-135 Rivet Joint, the high flying TR-1 (U-2), the US Navy's EP-3 and EKA-3B aircraft and the RAF's Nimrod R.1. These aircraft were strategically positioned to cover particular sectors of IADS coverage when Allied aircraft, in the period preceding hostilities, feigned penetrations of Iraqi airspace. This is the oldest trick in the electronic warfare book and the Iraqis fell for it repeatedly, lighting up their radars to engage the would be inbounds, in doing so they provided the monitoring Elint platforms with their positions and the identities of their radars, in turn betraying the composition of their batteries. It is also very likely that the Iraqis indulged in the luxury of live testing and calibration of their radars, further assisting the Allied effort.<br><br>The most capable SIGINT/ELINT system in service is the US Air Force RC-135V/W Rivet Joint, equipped with the highly capable Raytheon 55000 Electronic Support Measures (ESM) and 85000 signals intelligence (SIGINT) receiver systems. The Rivet Joint played a pivotal role in the Desert Storm campaign, and more recently in the OAF, OEF and OIF campaigns (U.S. Air Force).<br><br>With Elint equipment of appropriate capability it is possible to determine not only the type of emitter, but also often which model or subtype and its standard of calibration, all from the monitored and recorded emissions.<br><br>The Iraqis violated a fundamental principle of electronic combat by lighting up radars outside of actual engagements, and then not moving or reshuffling their assets to invalidate Allied reconnaissance. Were they to have done the proper thing, they would have moved batteries to dummy SAM sites, lit up in the presence of Allied Elint aircraft, and then shifted the batteries to implement a scheme of tactical or strategic deception. If this is implemented properly, and appropriate emission control discipline enforced, it becomes very difficult for the attacking party to map out what the real structure of the target IADS is. This in turn makes the planning of a pre-emptive strike very difficult, as with the increasing complexity of the deception the risk of not taking out all key assets in the initial hit increases vastly.<br><br>By the middle of January the Allies had a comprehensive picture of Iraq's IADS and were well positioned for a knock-out blow against the system, with substantial hard kill defence suppression assets in the theatre. Key systems were the F-4G Wild Weasel, a Phantom airframe fitted with a potent radar homing and warning receiver system (APR-47 RHAWS), which was supplemented by the HARM firing F-16C and F/A-18C. These aircraft were further supported by Alarm firing Tornado GR.1s of the RAF and HARM capable EA-6B Prowlers, A-7Es and A-6Es of the USN.<br><br>Jamming assets assembled in the theatre included USAF EC-130 Compass Call standoff communications jammers, Naval EA-6B Prowlers and the USAF's EF-111A Ravens. The protracted buildup was a major benefit to the Allies, who used the time to upgrade both hardware and software in many of the jamming systems, to precisely match the Iraqi inventory. Unlike the Israelis in 1973, who carried the wrong jammers and warning receivers for the threat at hand, the Allies had the best of intelligence and used it to the fullest.<br><br>The Allied planners envisaged a three pronged strategy for winning the electronic battle, concentrating on the simultaneous implementation of the following objectives:<br>Â•	suppression of enemy air defences (SEAD) via jamming, anti-radiation missiles, decoys and precision guided weapons delivered by penetrating aircraft and standoff platforms.<br>Â•	crippling the C3 network by jamming with EC-130 Compass Call aircraft, until key nodes could be destroyed by strike aircraft.<br>Â•	the use of onboard Defensive ECM by penetrating aircraft to defeat any SAMs which would get airborne in spite of the preceding activity.<br>The coup was meticulously planned, with the principal objective of the first phase of the SEAD campaign being the earliest possible paralysis of the GCI/EW network via the killing of key radar and C3 sites, this to be achieved by a series of simultaneous attacks by a range of different aircraft types.<br><br>Once the network was paralysed, individual area defences and point defences would have to light up their local radars to acquire inbound Allied aircraft and thus expose themselves. The local area defences would then be attacked by SEAD aircraft attached to inbound strike packages, with the twofold objectives of preventing attrition of strike aircraft and inflicting attrition upon elements of the IADS, thus implementing the second phase of the SEAD campaign.</span></blockquote></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>The RWR is smarter than that.  It has audio cues to inform the pilot what stage the SAM is in.  Different SAMs, different radars, different sounds as well.  There is no single tone that says it all.  Its ALMOST idiot proof, that if a SAM was launched AT you or is tracking someone, you WILL know and recognise the different audio cue.<br><br>What i meant is, an SA-6 search radar, may not be what the weasel wants to kill or suppress.  Search radars on the RWR or HTS may be spoofs or hoaxes used to draw away the 2 precious HARMs carried on the F-16s.

I think you made enough sense that theoretically it can do so.  But now what I'm saying is, maybe a pilot won't want to shoot unknown emissions since he cannot be sure its an enemy radar or anything worth shooting at all.<br><br>As learnt from Allied Force, not Gulf War 1, the classic SAM kill just doesn't happen anymore.  The entire KARI IADS was fooled into radiating and was killed by a massive SEAD strike operation using drones pretending to be BUFFs.  But in Allied Force, Serbian SAMS did not shoot or make unecessary emissions  unless the target was under 10k ft IIRC. Did that pose a problem? Well, yes and no.  While only 2 aircraft were supposedly shot down by the Serbs (1 being an F117), only 3 out 25 batteries of SAMs were destroyed as well, NATO aircraft were still able to carry out their strike sorties.<br><br>Did the SAMs accomplish what they had to by simply surviving? Yes! Because the Serbian SAMs were never quite neutralised, every strike package had to have an accompanying SEAD Escort package.  Even that was not enough, certain aircraft of the strike package itself had to carry Harms JUST in case the SEAD Escorts were unable to respond in time.  Which actually happened too frequently for comfort.<br><br>The Serbian SAMs inflicted what we call, "virtual attrition" upon NATO aircraft. They forced NATO to fly more sorties, use more fuel, carry less strike munitions and more jamming gear.<br><br>So even if you "Suppress" my SAMs, forcing me to take only shots that am confident of hitting, I am still dealing you virtual damage with the fact that my batteries are STILL operational.  Just quiet.<br><br>Restrictions not referring to just political restrictions.  But also to environmental.  Again, lessons learnt from Allied Force, the SIGINT and ELINT aircraft had difficulties looking into mountainous and hilly terrains.  The terrain itself masked the presence of such equipment.<br><br>Yes, fully agreed.  Even in Allied Force, the Russians commented that if the Serbs had just a SINGLE battalion of SA-10s, the NATO campaign would have been gravely complicated.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote>Originally posted by Shotgun:<br>The RWR is smarter than that.  It has audio cues to inform the pilot what stage the SAM is in.  Different SAMs, different radars, different sounds as well.  There is no single tone that says it all.  Its ALMOST idiot proof, that if a SAM was launched AT you or is tracking someone, you WILL know and recognise the different audio cue.</blockquote>I never say itÂ’s single toned, and actually I used the phrase Â“ ModernÂ” RWR to highlight todayÂ’s RWR can be very complicated which is even with microprocessor to handle signals.<br><br><blockquote>What i meant is, an SA-6 search radar, may not be what the weasel wants to kill or suppress.

Whereas, a fire control radar, or a radar that is locked is the real deal and truly deserves a shot. </blockquote>We are not going into details of tactics for both of us are not military pilots who are trained to do this. What the point is the ARM is effective to suppress your old generation radar which usually is powerless except shot down.<br><br><blockquote>So now, im not longer arguing whether a Harm can home in on a jammer. I think you made enough sense that theoretically it can do so. .</blockquote>Not only theoretically but also in practice.:<br><br><a href="http://www.missilethreat.com/missiledefensesystems/id.20/system_detail.asp" rel="nofollow">http://www.missilethreat.com/missiledefensesystems/id.20/system_detail.asp</a><br><br><blockquote><span style="color: blue;">In a report to Congress on May 28, 2004, the U.S. Department of Defense highlighted the major improvements that China has made to its air and missile defense systems over the past few years, including "[the] development of an antiradiation SAM [surface-to-air missile], most likely intended to target AWACS [Airborne Warning and Control System] aircraft and standoff jamming platforms."U.S. Department of Defense, "FY04 Report to Congress on PRC Military Power Pursuant to the FY2000 National Defense Authorization Act," May 2004.<br><br><strong>The report was referring specifically to the FT-2000, a Chinese anti-radiation surface-to-air missile system designed to counter electronic jamming aircraft,</strong> AWACS aircraft, and other air radiation wave targets. .. the FT-2000 is also believed to be capable of destroying tactical ballistic missiles, similar to the U.S. Patriot and the Russian S-300P systems on The FT-2000 is the direct result of a concerted effort by China to eliminate an inherent vulnerability in medium- and long-range surface-to-air missiles: jamming. For decades, air and missile defense systems like the Patriot and the S-300P have been susceptible to advanced techniques designed to confuse or immobile their interceptor missiles and keep them from reaching their targets. One of the most common jamming devices is S- and C-band airborne noise. If used properly, this and other deception mechanisms lead to what is known as the "suppression of enemy air defenses" and allows attacking aircraft and missiles to proceed to their targets without challenge.SinoDefense.com.<br><br>The FT-2000 was designed to neutralize and counter these airborne jamming devices. It contains a passive radar target seeker programmed to detect the specific electromagnetic signals emanating from its target. Essentially, the FT-2000 uses its target's own jamming frequencies against it. In addition, the FT-2000 has a passive homing system that does not transmit electromagnetic waves, thus minimizing the chances that its enemies will detect it in timeÂ… The system is equipped with modified HQ-9 interceptor missiles, each of which is 6.8 meters long, 0.47 meters in diameter, and has a launch weight of 1,300 kilograms. The HQ-9 missiles give the FT-2000 a range of 12 to 100 kilometers and an operating altitude of 3 to 20 kilometers. The mobile system is transported and launched on an 8 X 8 cross-country launcher with four canisters that resemble those used by the S-300P. </span></blockquote>Remember your unfinished Â“ mutli-radar multi-locationÂ” scenario? Yes, the FT2000 utilizes  4 phase arrayed passive radar in 4 different location to geo-locate the jamming source the FT-2000 ARM is essentially a S-300 SAM by airframe &amp; flight profile.  If the FT-2000 was fired alongside with other normal SAMs like S-300 and HQ-9, how can the SEAD mission to differentiate which one is ARM and which one is SAM? Keep jamming, the slow moving EC-130 jammer will be the preyby FT-2000, but stop jamming, other fighters may be the prey of S-300/HQ-9. now you see, how a ARM Â“ Home on the jammerÂ”<br><br><blockquote>Â…<br>The Serbian SAMs inflicted what we call, "virtual attrition" upon NATO aircraft. They forced NATO to fly more sorties, use more fuel, carry less strike munitions and more jamming gear.<br><br>So even if you "Suppress" my SAMs, forcing me to take only shots that am confident of hitting, I am still dealing you virtual damage with the fact that my batteries are STILL operational.  Just quiet.  </blockquote>Your SAMs are still there but for what usage when your supposed-to-protect asserts like airport/C3 centers etc all being destructed by air raids.<br><br><blockquote>Restrictions not referring to just political restrictions.  But also to environmental.  Again, lessons learnt from Allied Force, the SIGINT and ELINT aircraft had difficulties looking into mountainous and hilly terrains.  The terrain itself masked the presence of such equipment.</blockquote>Off topic,   Singapore doesnÂ’t have mountainous and hilly terrains to exploit but only Malaysia has which means itÂ’s not a good news for RSAFÂ’s EW platforms<br><br><blockquote>Yes, fully agreed.  Even in Allied Force, the Russians commented that if the Serbs had just a SINGLE battalion of SA-10s, the NATO campaign would have been gravely complicated.  </blockquote>ThatÂ’s all my point a 3G SAM upgrading is the only way to go. Same as the E-2C being replaced by the radar more advanced G550 CAEW. .<br><br></div>
