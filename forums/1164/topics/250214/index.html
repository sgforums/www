            <div class='col-md body'>Theater defense or not is immaterial as long as your SAM radar is facing or going to face new standoff threats like KH-31P ARM. As long as your SAMÂ’s radar triggers the Su-30 MKMÂ’s RWR, it will pinpoint the radarÂ’s location and upload the parameters to the KH-31P, then you can pretty sure whatÂ’s next, the KH-31Pthen will be launched following the radiation from the Radar. However, if the radar happened to be phase arrayed, in search mode, it can use less beam power to detect the su30 MKM without triggering the fighterÂ’s RWR. Even if the su30MKMÂ’s RWR being triggered, the KH-31P will find it hard to lock on the frequency agile main beam emitted from the ground Phase array radar. Thus, the survival chance of the phase array radar is much improved over old era mechanical scanning radars. If enemy suppressed your radar, whatÂ’s going to do with missiles? Upgrading a SAM system, 1st thing has to upgrade the radar.</div>
