            <div class='col-md body'>My advice is to get a commercial design. Our field packs are (IMHO) not yet at the level of US Military (COTS based) and may never get there due to cost considerations.<br><br>The seperate water bag is so that soldiers can drink when they are not wearing their field pack i.e. during the assault. However the problem is that the field pack squashes the waterbag and causes it to leak as a result. Some more discerning soldiers have a seperate waterbag carrier and just strap it on top of their field pack when it is worn.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Just do a search on ebay. Last time I was at sheares (in sept) they were still selling the ALICE pack so I don't think they would have it. You can find it for about USD 5.99 or so, but the international shipping would kill you... Unless you get all your khakis to order as well, or you order other stuff. Given that the MOLLE system has replaced the ALICE for about 5-6 years now I don't really understand why we haven't changed over.</div>

The problem is i'm not going to be in the army long enough to warrant buying expensive bits of kit...but the frequency of pack-humping is enough to drive anyone nuts!</div>
