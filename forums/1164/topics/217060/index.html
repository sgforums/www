The Leclarc uses an Auto loader like some one already said.<br>The M8 ags uses and autoloader.And like i say,new tanks are already headed in that direction.Not really a long time away.The US is already devloping them.<br><br>And no a human loader cannot keep up the rate of load.Even if he could for the full 30-40 rounds, can he do it after being on duty say 30 hours?fire off 5-15 rounds then wait and patrol then fire off another 15 rounds or so in the next engagment?Will be manage to keep up the rate?Or how about after firing 30 rounds,resup then go off and fire again to fire off that 30 rounds?I highly doubt.<br><br>And yes the gun does need to be in a certain position,but the newer loaders allow it to be loaded in most positions unless the gun is in some super high elevation.Otherwise a some degs up or down is ok.<br><br>Anyway,since most tanks and guns area headed that way,i guess our motar just got there 1st.<br>Afterall naval guns have been using autoloaders for quite sometime already though they are big.<br><br>But i would like to add that having an extra man in the tank is quite useful.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Your argument is not very logical. You tell me "tanks are not artillery". But then you are the one who said "because western tanks don't use autoloader...blah blah". But we are talking about Bronco Mortar here! That is artillery!<br>Also I'm not as dumb as you think....pointing out to me that flick rammer is not autoloader......I know that. But like I said the NEW german self propelled artillery uses autoloader. Why don't you go find out first before arguing? The one I'm talking about is pzh2000.<br>Also the french leclerc is the only western tank using autoloader because it came out after Leopard 2, M1 and Challenger.<br>And if you look at later western weapons, like pzh2000. it also uses autoloader.</div>

It never was put into production because it ended up to be more expensive than the M1 - less bang for more bucks.<br><br>Naval guns have autoloaders because they can utilise the 4 to 6 m space below decks for the ammo handling and automation system.  Also, naval guns are multipurpose and need higher rates of fire when firing at airplanes - autoloading is essential.<br><br></div>
