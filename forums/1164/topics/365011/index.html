              <p>Sunday 21 June 2009</p>
              <div id="article-wrapper">
              <p>A confidential record of a meeting between President Bush and <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/tonyblair">Tony Blair</a> before the invasion of <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/iraq">Iraq</a>,
              outlining their intention to go to war without a second United Nations
              resolution, will be an explosive issue for the official inquiry into
              the UK's role in toppling <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/saddam-hussein">Saddam Hussein</a>.</p>
              <p>The
              memo, written on 31 January 2003, almost two months before the invasion
              and seen by the Observer, confirms that as the two men became
              increasingly aware UN inspectors would fail to find weapons of mass
              destruction (WMD) they had to contemplate alternative scenarios that
              might trigger a second resolution legitimising military action.</p>
              <p>Bush
              told Blair the US had drawn up a provocative plan <span style="color: #ff0000;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>"to fly U2
              reconnaissance aircraft painted in UN colours over Iraq with fighter
              cover". Bush said that if Saddam fired at the planes this would put the
              Iraqi leader in breach of UN resolutions.</strong></span></span></p>
              <p>The president expressed
              hopes that an Iraqi defector would be "brought out" to give a public
              presentation on Saddam's WMD or that someone might assassinate the
              Iraqi leader. However, Bush confirmed even without a second resolution,
              the US was prepared for military action. The memo said Blair told Bush
              he was "solidly with the president".</p>
              <p>The five-page document, written by Blair's <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/foreignpolicy">foreign policy</a> adviser, Sir David Manning, and copied to Sir Jeremy Greenstock, the UK
              ambassador to the UN, Jonathan Powell, Blair's chief of staff, the
              chief of the defence staff, Admiral Lord Boyce, and the UK's ambassador
              to Washington, Sir Christopher Meyer, outlines how Bush told Blair he
              had decided on a start date for the war.</p>
              <p>Paraphrasing Bush's
              comments at the meeting, Manning, noted: <span style="color: #ff0000;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>"The start date for the
              military campaign was now pencilled in for 10 March. This was when the
              bombing would begin." </strong></span></span></p>
              <p>Last night an expert on international law
              who is familar with the memo's contents said it provided vital evidence
              into the two men's frames of mind as they considered the invasion and
              its aftermath and must be presented to the Chilcott inquiry established
              by Gordon Brown to examine the causes, conduct and consequences of the
              Iraq war.</p>
              <p>Philippe Sands, QC, a professor of law at University
              College London who is expected to give evidence to the inquiry, said
              confidential material such as the memo was of national importance,
              making it vital that the inquiry is not held in private, as Brown
              originally envisioned.</p>
              <p>In today's Observer, Sands writes:
              "Documents like this raise issues of national embarrassment, not
              national security. The restoration of public confidence requires this
              new inquiry to be transparent. Contentious matters should not be kept
              out of the public domain, even in the run-up to an election."</p>
              <p>The
              memo notes there had been a shift in the two men's thinking on Iraq by
              late January 2003 and that preparing for war was now their priority.<span style="color: #ff0000;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong> "Our diplomatic strategy had to be arranged around the military
              planning,"</strong></span></span> Manning writes. This was despite the fact Blair that had yet
              to receive advice on the legality of the war from the Attorney General,
              Lord Goldsmith, which did not arrive until 7 March 2003 - 13 days
              before the bombing campaign started.</p>
              <p>In his article today, Sands
              says the memo raises questions about the selection of the chair of the
              inquiry. Sir John Chilcott sat on the 2004 Butler inquiry, which
              examined the reliability of intelligence in the run-up to the Iraq war,
              and would have been privy to the document's contents - and the doubts
              about WMD running to the highest levels of the US and UK governments.</p>
              <p>Many
              senior legal experts have expressed dismay that Chilcott has been
              selected to chair the inquiry as he is considered to be close to the
              security services after his time spent as a civil servant in Northern
              Ireland.</p>
              <p>Brown had believed that allowing the Chilcott inquiry
              to hold private hearings would allow witnesses to be candid. But after
              bereaved families and antiwar campaigners expressed outrage, the prime
              minister wrote to Chilcott to say that if the panel can show witnesses
              and national security issues will not be compromised by public
              hearings, he will change his stance.</p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Lord Guthrie, a former chief
              of the defence staff under Blair, described the memo as "quite
              shocking".</strong></span></span> He said that it underscored why the Chilcott inquiry must be
              seen to be a robust investigation: "It's important that the inquiry is
              not a whitewash as these inquiries often are."</p>
              <p>This year, the
              Dutch government launched its own inquiry into its support for the war.
              Significantly, the inquiry will see all the intelligence shared with
              the Dutch intelligence services by MI5 and MI6. The inquiry intends to
              publish its report in November - suggesting that confidential
              information about the role played by the UK and the US could become
              public before Chilcott's inquiry reports next year.</p>
