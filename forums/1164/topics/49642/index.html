Even if it was flame bait, why stoop to the trolls level and give him what he wants? After all we're humans, not fish and are supposed capable of higher thought processing.<br><br>They saw something in Bahasa, assumed it was a direct attack on themselves or their families, and went spewing obscenities without a 2nd thought of the consequences. As it turned out, their response to what I don't deny, was a jibe from Kol turned out to be way over the top of disproportionate.<br><br>Nathan, you follow the policy of Kill First, Ask Questions Later, and wouldn't care if the victim is innocent? Thats your perogative, I hope for your sake you won't get to experience it for real life one day. But unfortunately I don't think the moderators want to see such attitudes prevail here from forummers when posting. I know I don't</div>
