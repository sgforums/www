            <div class='col-md body'>Well not sure of what we use anymore, sure hate the memory of digging mines !<br><br>But remember in thailand, was shown a activation device, that can switch between sound and light mode. That mean if set to sound mode, it will detonate on certain sound level. If set to light mode, you can cover it with a cloth and if you lift the cloth and light get in and it detonate.<br><br>We are suppose to see an actual demo on it but end up we are the demo, because someone set set it wrong, and while we are admiring it, it blow up ! It is armed with real C4, but lucky the is no stones or anything nearby so all only get concursion only and cover with dust.</div>

"<br><br>Well the proliferation of mines, have gaps in it that still allow countries to use it. It is more to protect irresponsible laying of mines. That mean you must fence it up and mark with proper markings and warnings. Also accept the responsibility of remove them after war.<br><br>A lot of countries like US and singapore cannot do away with mines. What they are doing advance research into technology in expiration date of mines. That mean, once layed, after certain time, they will self detonate, this remove the need to remove them and prevent the event of in long time forget about them and they end up dangerous when forgotten.</div>
