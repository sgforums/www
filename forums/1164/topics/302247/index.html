            <div class='col-md body'>This is what I understand about the conflict.<br><br>Judah was conquered by Roman Empire somewhere before Christ. Judah became a Roman province.<br><br>Around ~70 AD, a Jewish rebellion occured. Romans completely smashed the rebellion. Jewish temple destroyed and Jews expelled from Palestine/Israel. Jews subsequently scatter all over the world. Jews effectively become stateless.<br><br>Fast forward to early 20th century. Jews start to push for a Jewish homeland.<br><br>Fast forward again to post-WWII. The British,the mandate holders of Palestine/Israel at the time, grant the Jews a state in the area.<br><br>UN divides Israel/Palestine into a Israeli controlled zone and a Palestinian controlled zone with Jerusalem under international control. Arab nations aren't really happy about it. They attack Israel. Arab nations lose this war. The Palestine controlled areas lose large portions of territory. Lotsa Palestinians flee and become homeless and stateless.<br><br>That kinda sums up the roots of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.<br><br>I'm not entirely clear about the details. I might have gotten bits and pieces here and there wrong. Feel free to correct it.</div>
