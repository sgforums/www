            <div class='col-md body'>The 84mm is a great weapon that the US had also adopted, if I'm not wrong. And there is a newer, lighter version of this great recoiless rifle.<br><br>But even for platoon support this weapon is a little too clumsy especially for us Asians. Maybe still OK as a company support weapon.<br><br>When you're at live firing, try not to be near the 84mm guys. That beast is fxxking LOUD and the ground shakes when it is being fired.<br><br>Some of the worst military jobs are in the Army. And some of the worst Army jobs include Combat Engineers, Pioneer, 81mm mortar and the 84mm RR.<br><br>Every time I feel like shxt doing rifleman's job I remember the look on my friend's face when I bumped into his unit at a training area (I think in SAFTI).<br><br>He had a cute little miniature "golf club" and was a member of a Pioneer platoon.<br><br>Their job involve getting down and crawling and poking the ground for landmines with that golf club. Now imagine doing this at SAFTI, on hard-packed clay ground, with no trees and the sun raising temperatures to above 35 degrees.<br><br>I'll never forget the "WHY ME?" look on my friend's face. Those of you stll haven't go NS better study hard to avoid this fate. For all the 3G sophistication, this vocation is apparently still open in SAF. And there's still all them little golf clubs there waiting for you.<br><br>There is no job less glamourous or more demeaning that crawling the ground poking for land mines. Even being a GD man (people considered dangerous around firearms and useful only for area cleaning and manual labour) would be preferrable.</div>

But as the platoon moved forward the MG had to "relocate" a few times to provide fire support for different sections. But still very siong.<br><br>After FIBUA objective captured we moved on to capture FOFO objective - all in the same night.<br><br>By morning, we could hardly move, knees all jelly from all that walking, running and jumping in and out of windows and trenches. The MG gunner sgt fell asleep in between firing. KNN, then the observers or something.. those officers there to grade your unit's performance - make us redo the FOFO. But later gave us top marks. We got Best Unit.<br><br>edit:<br>Best Unit of our division. ahem...</div>
