            <div class='col-md body'>Jap, on the other hand, was not really on-par with the US, British or Germany. Jap was successful against China only at the beginning. Her industrial manufacturing base was too weak to support a prolong conflict with US (on naval battles) and China (on land warfare). Her technological development was behind Britain and US, but Jap managed to havest a lot of biological data through her cruel expeiments on US, Russian, British, Korean and Chinese POWs conducted by the Elite unit known as 731 unit in Manchuria.<br><br>Jap only effective fighting units are her 4 aircraft carriers that were lost early in the WW2 in Battle of Midway. Jap zero fighter enjoyed some degree of success in the early days esp Jap Zero verses  USN Wildcat and British Buffaloes fighters. But as more capable Allied fighters appeared at the front lines, Jap air superiority was lost. It was noted that Jap Zero fighters was shot down in doves by British Hurricanes and Spitfires, when Jap tried to attack the British Navy in India after they drove out the British from Burma in 1942. The Flying Tigers enjoyed a high degree of success against the Jap Zero as well using the US P40 fighter.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>German Army..great tactics, great discipline, great field craft<br><br>3 instances:<br><br>1st instance:<br><br>A German POW from a 88mm anti armor platoon was mocked by an American soldier. "Hey Kraunt, if your army is so good why are you a POW now?" The POW replied " Go up to Hill XXX, you see a trail of burning tanks there" Whatever the British army and your army threw at us we hit them, 1 tank came, we hit them, 2 came we hit, 3 came we hit, 4 and 5 we destroyed them all..we didnt miss a round.. we surrendered cos the tanks keep coming in and we ran out of rounds!"<br><br>2nd instance:<br><br>German land forces (Germany's strongest armed force comprised of the Heer and the Waffen-SS) in World War II or about 3 million soldiers. The USSR, for its part, lost as many as 12 million lives. Again, the red army kept pouring over the frontier. The German army collpased due to the sheer number of soldiers pouring in..<br><br>3rd instance:<br><br>Rommel's  Panzer Divsion, Kill Ratio 8-1 at its peak</div>

Can you see FG42, MP44, ME262 jet fighters and many more?<br>The Germans were the best trained soldiers during WWII especially the Waffen-SS units and the paratroopers.
