            <div class='col-md body'>Chinese Nationalist Troop fare very badly in WW2 against Jap.<br><br>To be fair, the command structure of the nationalist Troops are modelled after the German Army. Even the late Taiwwanese president Chiajng Jing Kok was trained in armour warfare in Germany.<br><br>Thus, when the Jap began her agression against China in 1933, the Chinese troops managed to repel many Jap attacks under the German "advisers". The nationalist troops managed to nearly eliminate the Chinese Communists in mid 1930s.<br><br>However, the Germany was forced to choose btw Jap and China as her world conquest ally in late 1936. Hilter decided to choose jap as a result all the Panzer tanks and 88mm AA guns that were supooised to shipped to China were held back in Germany. Worst of all, the german advisers were recalled back to Germany.<br><br>Thus, Jap decided to kick start the full scale invasion of China after the last German Adviser left in 1937. To complicate the matter, the Nationalist Strong Man Chiang kai Siax loved to jump guns on commanding every troopers in the field. Worst of all, Chiang kai Siax prefered to use out dated war tactics based on static defences and passive doctrines. Thus, the Chinese Nationalist Troops performed badly against the Jap after 1937.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>The Nazi German Wermacht was the Best. Period.<br><br>They had the best technology,<br>-MG-42 (the most feared weapon by the allied forces)<br>-V-1 and V-2 which country in the world at that time had ballistic missiles?<br>-Tiger MK IV this bugger can chew up shermans in no time... unfortunately it was introduced a little too late.<br>-Actually the Kar98 was a good rifle, it only sucked because it was bolt-action and had 5 rounds accuracy wise none could match maybe perhaps springfield.<br>-ME 262(correct me if im wrong) had jet power whereas the rest were still relying on props.<br><br>They had the will power to win.<br>Hitler was amazing in his speeches and that is why the germans are willing to die for their fuhrer for what he had promised them. I admire Hitler's tactics other than two mistakes of Operation Barbrossa and the failure to capture Bastogne. Otherwse we would be sprechen Deutsch right now.<br>I must agree that the Waffen SS had the best will to fight other than the polish conscripts.<br><br>The Kriegsmarine was superb in the construction of pocket battleships. I read in a book a couple of years ago that one German battleship suffered (approx) 32 small shells 36 medium shells 12 heavy shells and two torpedos but still managed to limp back to port for repairs. It goes to say how mighty their equipment was.<br><br>Most dissappointing part of Germany was the Luftwaffe. it was obliberated by the allies again the ME262 was introduced too late.<br><br>The german army of WWII on the whole was superb in command, equipment and morale.<br><br>I actually dislike the US Army. I must say Eisenhower was great but a little bit lucky as well.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>The German army was damn good, but their only downfall was that they were stretched too far across Europe, and having to help their useless allies like Italy in Africa.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>The Germans, definitely. They were finally done in mainly because of Hitler's arrogance and stupidity in thinking that he since he could conquer Wetern Europe, he could conquer Russia as well. In his words, 'We only have to kick the door down and the whole rotten structure will crumble'.<br><br>I've read an interesting book on what Hitler should have done to ensure success. Instead of conquering Russia, he should have just focused on capturing North Africa. Rommel had asked for just four armoured divisions for the job. However, Hitler was so obssessed with Russia that he could spare only little more than one division. Even then, Rommel came close to winning.<br><br>They could most likely have easily captured North Africa if Rommel were given what he asked for. They could have captured the Suez Canal at one end, and Gibraltar at the other... which would lead to the entire Mediterranean belonging to the Axis.<br><br>Sure, Russia has oil in the Caucasus. But that's peanuts compared to what the Middle East has to offer after the conquest of North Africa. The Brits couldn't have been able to reinforce the Persian Gulf. All that oil would have made the Wehrmacht even tougher.<br><br>Once they're done with the Middle East, they could go on to India if they wanted to. Heck, they could whack India from the West, and the Japs could whack them from the East.<br><br>This scenario sounds a little simplistic, but I would say that it has quite a reasonable chance of success.</div>
