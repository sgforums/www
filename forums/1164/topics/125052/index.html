            <div class='col-md body'>by placing one rock per day, the fence will soon turn into a wall, making it more secure......... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">  when the patrol realise that the wall is of human height, its time to ORD <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br><br>just joking.......i really have no idea</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>My point of view on the placing of rocks in the fence is that when there is anyone who try to cut the fence the rocks will fall off and create some sound which will alert the nearest sentry. This is a cheap improvised alarm system. Make sense?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"><br></div>
