I think you are mixing up your electical forces with the basic laws of motion.<br><br>Aren't you forgetting the impulse of accelerating a person? Everytime any load is placed on the escalator (or it has to accelerate a load) still it experiences a recoil force that is the reaction of moving the load. But due to the fact the escalator is many times more massive then the load it moves (a person), as well as to being secured, it does not seem to experience any recoil. But as a matter of fact it does.<br><br>Imagine an escalator moving very quickly <span style="font-style: italic;">not</span> secured to the ground and placed on frictionless sliding rails. The moment a person steps onto it, or even if the chain is started while the person is on it, the escalator will indeed, recoil and move back along the rails.<br><br>The escalator will not recoil if there was no load placed on it and all that was cycling was the mass of it's chain, because it is by all means perfectly balanced like a wheel spinning. HOWEVER, this moving mass still generates a recoil force which we know as torque. Even if somehow the railgun works as you mentioned (which it does not), significant torque forces will be generated.<br><br>Basically, for every action there is an equal and opposite reaction.<br><br>The circilar "recoil" system you describe as "mass" cycling will only work if there was an equal mass on the opposite side "cycling" as well. That is the only way of countering the vector force generated by the reaction of accelerating a projectile, it does not magically cycle around in the electical "loop". That just does not happen.<br><br>And I also dunno where you get your theory from... because the last I checked, nobody said that being recoiless was a feature of railguns at all... in fact they explictly mentioned that such a thing was impossible.<br><br>In fact, it is mentioned that recoil is a significant problem for railguns launching heavier projectiles at higher speeds, and there are even patents on how to migitate it:<br><br><a href="http://www.freepatentsonline.com/4840107.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.freepatentsonline.com/4840107.html</a><br><br>Also:<br><br><blockquote>The need for strong conductive materials with which to build the rails and projectiles; the rails need to survive the violence of an accelerating projectile, and heating due to the large currents and friction involved. <strong>The force exerted on the rails consists of a recoil force - <span style="color: red;">equal and opposite </span>to the force propelling the projectile, but along the <span style="color: red;">length of the rails </span>(which is their strongest axis)</strong> - and a sideways force caused by the rails being pushed by the magnetic field, just as the projectile is. The rails need to survive this without bending, and <strong>must be very securely mounted</strong>.</blockquote>So yes, railguns = recoil. The recoil forces cannot just remain in the barrel without having to go somewhere... and in a handheld weapon this means this impulse would transfer to the rest of weapon and eventually to the shooter. How much recoil the shooter experiences depends on how much is soaked up by the mass and recoil buffering features of the weapon (like the recoil system in the Barret).<br><br>In terms of the idea of a personal infantry railgun hurling rounds much faster then conventional bullets, the recoil of such a weapon would be a very big issue to overcome.

The response of the rail-gun/normal gun depends on their masses. The heavier the gun the less recoil acceleration (and lower momentum) if would experience.<br><br><span style="color: red;">If the normal gun and rail-gun had the same mass (and length over which the projectile is accelerated), they would experience the same recoil for the same projectile mass and acceleration.</span></strong> </blockquote>However, the main advantage of railgun systems (especially in mass driver applications), is the ability to provide lower impulse then a conventional chemical energy gun system, which gives all of the impulse at the moment of firing. (Though if you are talking about accelerating projectiles to extremely high velocities close to c., then obviously the impulse of a railgun would be tremedous no matter how long the rails you have)<br><br><blockquote>It's not necessarily something that gets gone over explictly in class, but:<br>Force * time = mass * velocity = momentum<br><br>The recoil is essentially the same.<br><br>In practice conventional (i.e. chemical propelled) artillery launches things other than the projectile (like some of the explosive gasses), and because conventional artillery does not have constant acceleration capability (conventional guns usually have most of the acceleration take place at the beginning of the shot), odds are that the conventional artillery piece would experience more recoil, both in the sense that the maximal force on the gun is higher, and in the sense that the total momentum change of the gun is higher. <strong>However, this is an practical efficiency issue, rather than some fundemental difference between the guns, and it's readily concievable that a rail gun that uses some kind of sled to accelerate a projectile could have more recoil per projectile mass than a conventional gun</strong>.</blockquote><blockquote>Clearly, if the acceleration of the chemically propelled charge is higher than the acceleration of the mass in the rail-gun, then the reaction force on the normal gun is higher. On the other hand, the force (pressure * area) of the normal-gun chamber falls off as the projectile moves forward in the chamber, so the acceleration, which is initially higher than that of the rail-gun, decreases to a level below - given the constraint on the problem that the muzzle velocity is the same for both cases.</blockquote>Nowhere do you see them talking about railguns being recoiless... in fact they are just like any other gun system and have to deal with their generated recoil some way or another.</div>

An interesting read, if somewhat uncivil at times.<br><br><blockquote><span style="color: blue;">Ben Says:<br>January 5th, 2007<br>there would actually not be any kickback do to newtons law because newtons law says that Â“every action has a reactionÂ” in a regular gun it is caused by gun powder exploding which creates a burst of expanding gases out of the tube, but in a coil gun there is not expanding air only electromagnetism that is dispersed out of the end of a wire after the projectile has been fired, it is also extremely feesable in the sense that it makes very little sound, you donÂ’t have to worry about gunpowder being wet or even having to carry the extra weight of it, also it can create more power, it can have greater range and as i said earlier, very little kick back </span><br><br><span style="color: red;">ACG Says:<br>January 23rd, 2007<br>Ben:<br>Nice words but unfortunately none are true. </span><br><br><span style="color: blue;">Ben Says:<br>January 23rd, 2007<br>ive actually found that out haha, i still find it hard to understand, but could you explain it again? </span><br><br><span style="color: red;">Errant Says:<br>February 1st, 2007<br>Hi Ben,<br><br>yes itÂ’s an easy concept to grab a hold of and assume - <strong>unfortunately recoil is a bad problem</strong><br><br>Have you done much on electromagnetism? ThatÂ’s not a dig  just a question. You see it isnÂ’t so much that the projectile has a force applied by the electric field as the coil and the projectile repel each other. By holding the coil fairly still you make the projectile take the Â‘bruntÂ’ of the force.<br><br>As in a normal handgun the gas pressure forces the gun and the projectile apart - this creates a recoil or a force backwards which you have to steady.<br><br><strong>So unfortunately altho physically the electromagnetic waves do not give us recoil they force the coil itself back - which does  </strong><br><br>I am working on a project now with a friend from university to get some kind of Â‘blow backÂ’ action similar to that of a normal handgun.

            <div class='col-md body'>ST: That is pretty much it. The accelerating rails in the gun will inflict a force on the barrel by Newton's 3rd law and the law of conservation of momentum, not least that even though the Lorentz force (F = q (E + v x B) )  is used to drive the projectile forward and the projectile is in contact with the barrel although I believe that there are cooling fluids that are being tested to see if they can act as a lubricant while allowing high accelerating speeds. Also, we must recall Faraday's law and<br><br>The main difference between conventional guns and railguns is that conventional guns must provide provisions for a localised explosion within the gun because such high localised barrel pressures are deleterious to the barrel. Pretty much the early firearms suffered from this problem and it was only later with improvement in metallurgy techniques that guns with higher barrel pressure tolerances than older guns came along and we can use more propellant than before and achieve better range and weight of projectile hurled. Battleship guns pretty much epitomised this since Japanese, American, British and German guns are of varying quality. American 16" guns were the best if I recall and could hurl a larger projectile than even the 18" Japanese guns. One might think of them as rocket engines which fire short pulses.<br><br>Now comes the railgun. The Lorentz force drives the projectile which must certainly be a charge (otherwise the RF fields will have little effect on the projectile) and from basic electromagnetics, F = q E and this is an action reaction pair. From Lenz's law, we know that oscillating magnetic fields produce an action reaction force too. So the net result is a force that drives the projectile forward.<br><br>I am not so sure of a Gauss weapon, but regardless, even electrons carry momentum, thanks to de Broglie. Photons too, and do note that for laser weapons that start to reach terawatt or higher, you will start to see some palpable recoil.</div>
