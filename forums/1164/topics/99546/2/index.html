Can someone decipher this post?<br><br>To be able to speak and write in good English is important as this allows better communication and lower possibility of misunderstanding between people regardless if it is leisure or at work.<br><br>Of course, it doesn't have to go to the extent of using the Queen's English but at least be at a (simple and proper) level that enables others (including non-native English speaking people from other countries) to be able to understand. The percieved notion that majority of the Singaporeans can speak proper English (just that they preferred to converse in Singlish) is obsolete. We should not continue to kid ourselves that Singlish speakers are equally proficient in English. If one who doesn't converse nor write in proper English often, eventually he/she will lose his/her language proficiency.<br><br>A true to life incident which I encountered while in UK. My friend was chit chatting (more likely a one-sided machine gun rattle) with an English man while on the train. For the whole session, I noticed that he just nodded his head and smiled. As soon as my friend excused himself to the washroom, he turned to me and said ,"Your friend is a nice chap. Pity that I could not really understand his English, otherwise I would have enjoyed this conversation very much. By the way, where are you people from?"<br><br>This incident clearly shows that speaking good English is essential in conversing with people from overseas if we want to make the other party understand what we are trying to say. Perhaps we should learn from the Dutch, while Dutch being their mother tongue is spoken all over Netherlands, they are equally at ease with English (not even the slightest hint of the language being  broken/modified). Same goes to the rest of Europeans, while some of them might speak in a heavily accented English, at least I find that they are easier to understand then some of our local Singlish speakers.</div>
