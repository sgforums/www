            <div class='col-md body'>CHING-KUO (IDF) INDIGENOUS DEFENCE FIGHTER, TAIWAN<br><br>The Taiwanese Ching-Kuo Fighter is developed and manufactured by the Aerospace Industrial Development Corporation based in Taichung. The aircraft is also referred to as the Indigenous Defence Fighter (IDF). The Ching-Kuo is an all-weather, multi-role fighter and is built in one-seater and two-seater configurations.<br><br>The programme to develop the aircraft, known as the An Hsiang or Safe Flight programme, started in 1982 with identification of the requirements for an air-superiority fighter. The rollout ceremony of the first prototype took place in December 1988, when the aircraft was named after the late President Chiang Ching-Kuo. The Ching-Kuo made its first flight in May 1989.<br><br>Ching-Kuo air superiority fighters have been operational in the RoC Air Force of Taiwan (Republic of China) since January 2000 and the last of a total of 130 entered service in July 2000. AIDC is developing an upgrade package which includes a digital cockpit and an upgraded radar.<br>WEAPONS<br><br>The aircraft has an integrated avionics and weapons control system.<br><br>A 20mm M61A Vulcan cannon is installed on the starboard side of the fuselage with a Photo-Sonics gun camera.<br><br>The aircraft has six hardpoints for carrying external stores, with two under the fuselage, one under each wing and one at each wingtip. The Tien Chien I (TC-1) or Skysword I short-range and the Tien Chien II (TC-2) or Skysword II medium-range air-to-air missiles are supplied by the China State Arsenals. TC-1 has a range of 5km and has an infrared seeker. TC-2, with a range of 60km, has active radar guidance and is armed with a high-explosive warhead weighing 22kg.<br><br>For ground attack, the aircraft can be armed with rocket pods, bombs, cluster bombs or air-to-surface missiles such as Maverick. The fighter is also being adapted to carry the TC-2A air-to-surface anti-radiation missile, which uses both active and passive radar guidance. TC-2A is being developed by the Chung Shan Institute of Science and Technology in Taipei. Anti-ship missiles such as the Hsiung Feng II, similar to the Israeli Gabriel missile and supplied by the China State Arsenals, can be carried on the fuselage or underwing hardpoints. Hsiung Feng II has a range of 80km, carries a dual-mode active radar and imaging infrared (III) seeker for terminal guidance and is armed with a 225kg semi armour-piercing, high-explosive warhead. Three Hsiung Feng II missiles can be carried - one under the central fuselage and one under each wing.<br>FUSELAGE<br><br>The airframe design was developed under the YingYan or Soaring Eagle programme. The aircraft is of shoulder-wing monoplane (single-wing) design, incorporating composite structure materials. The aircraft is built to withstand 9g loading.<br>COCKPIT<br><br>The pressurised and air-conditioned cockpit has a Martin Baker Mark 12 zero zero ejection seat and a single-piece bubble canopy. The cockpit is equipped with three multifunction displays and a head-up display.<br>AVIONICS<br><br>The Tien Lie or Sky Thunder programme covered the development of the avionics. The design of the avionics suite is configured in line replaceable units (LRU) to allow for system growth and the easy upgrade of systems as new technologies become available.<br><br>The aircraft uses a BAE Systems (formerly Lear Astronics) fly-by-wire control system and a Northrop Grumman (formerly Litton) inertial navigation system.<br>RADAR<br><br>The aircraftÂ�s radar is the Golden Dragon CD-53. The multi-mode pulse Doppler radar has look-down, shoot-down capability and can operate in air and sea search mode. The radar has a range over 80 nautical miles.<br>ENGINE<br><br>The TFE1042 engine has been developed by the International Turbine Engine Corporation (ITEC), a joint venture between the Aerospace Industrial Development Corporation (AIDC) and AlliedSignal. The programme to develop the engine was named Yun Han or Cloud Man. The engine, weighing 1,360lb, delivers 41.1kN maximum thrust. The modular-designed engine has full digital electronic controls.<br><br>The kidney-shaped air intakes are mounted low on the centre section of the fuselage, and the two engines are mounted side by side at the rear of the fuselage. The inspection schedule calls for a 2,000-hour hot section and 4,000-hour cold section inspection intervals. The fuel consumption is 0.81lb per hour per pound of thrust.<br><br>The aircraft is equipped with a variable speed constant frequency electrical power generator, which is supplied by Westinghouse.</div>

AEW&amp;C platforms, based on the Ilyushin Il-76, are now flying with the China Flight Test Establishment (CFTE).<br>Several photographs of these previously unknown aircraft have been released via Chinese sources in the same 'semi-official' way that the first images of the Chengdu J-10 fighter aircraft and other secretive Chinese defence projects have been leaked to outside observers. The images show aircraft carrying the badge of the CFTE, operating from Nanjing. No official information is available as to the status of the programme (or programmes) and observers are surprised at the level of advanced development that appears to have been reached.<br>Russia has already developed and deployed an Il-76-based AEW&amp;C platform as the Ilyushin/Beriev A-50 and A-50M 'Mainstay'. At the end of the 1990s, China attempted to acquire a similar capability from Israel Aircraft Industries, as the A-50I, using Russian-supplied airframes mated with the Elta Phalcon phased-array radar system in a fixed (non-rotating) radome. A development aircraft was flown in Israel but the deal was halted in 2000 under intense US political pressure. Israel has been adamant that no AEW&amp;C technology was transferred, although the bare A-50I airframe was handed over in 2002 to the Chinese authorities.<br>It should be noted that at least one of the aircraft seen flying in China has several key design features of the A-50I that are not found on Russia's 'Mainstays'. These include two ventral fins under the rear fuselage and the absence of the A-50's prominent fin-root intake.<br>Two different Chinese AEW&amp;C configurations have been observed. It is not clear if both are flying simultaneously. There may have been a staged testing effort to prove the final radome configuration or there may be two parallel programmes, involving at least a pair of aircraft.<br>One set of photographs shows an aircraft with its circular dorsal radome supported by a large tri-cornered mast. This arrangement may indicate the presence of a fixed phased-array radar, using three antennas in a triangular arrangement to provide 360? coverage. An equivalent antenna layout was part of the original A-50I design. The second AEW&amp;C configuration sees the radome sitting on two angled masts, similar to those of the existing A-50 design but with two horizontal bracing struts between the vertical supports. The radome on this aircraft appears to be deeper than that of a Russian A-50 - another pointer to the possible use of phased-array antennas in place of a rotating pulse-Doppler radar. Radar development for this programme may be the responsibility of the Nanjing Electronic Technology Research Institute (also known as the No 14 Institute), although there is a strong possibility of outside assistance, perhaps from Russia.<br>The origin of China's AEW&amp;C aircraft remains unclear, as does their number. JDW reported that China was seeking to acquire Il-76s from Uzbekistan in 1997, although Russia is unlikely to have permitted this. By 2003 China was understood to be negotiating directly with Russia for the supply of a new A-50 variant, the A-50Eh (Ehksport, export). This programme, known as Project No 5, is thought to cover the lease of two test and evaluation A-50 aircraft to be followed by the acquisition of three to six A-50Ehs. The programme is reportedly due for completion by 2005 with each aircraft costing $180 million-$200 million. According to JDW sources, the A-50Eh radar is able to detect a cruise missile-sized target in ground/sea clutter at ranges of up to 463km.<br>Taiwanese sources allege that a secret A-50Eh deal was concluded with Russia last year. Taiwanese press reports also state that the A-50s have been exercising with People's Liberation Army Air Force Su-27 (J-11) and Su-30MKK aircraft. The sudden appearance of Chinese A-50s in the Nanjing Military Region, so near the Taiwan Strait, has caused consternation in Taiwan and represents a major shift in China's ability to conduct integrated offensive air operations.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>In regards to PLA AEW capability.<br><br>Currently the PLA operates a small fleet of airborne platforms, including two KJ-2000 airborne early warning and control system (AWACS) aircraft, equipped with electronically steered phased-array (ESA) radars, being used to develop both the technology and concept of operations. Other platforms include: a Y-8 AWACS equipped with a beam-shape ESA radar, Tu-154M/D electronic intelligence (ELINT) aircraft, and H-6 surveillance platforms. Additionally, the PLA Navy (PLAN) also operates few Y-8 platforms for maritime surveillance and airborne early warning (with Racal Skymaster radar) roles.<br><br>Latest addition to the inventory is the Y-7 with Ericsson ErieEye (Still under development).<br><br>In regards to ROCAF or better known as Taiwanese AF (that is what they want to be called).<br><br>E-2T  nothing much to talk about...Everyone know what is it.

            <div class='col-md body'>When talking about ChinaÂ’s military, JaneÂ’s report is no difference with various China based military internet portal. 1 famous example is JaneÂ’s report on PLAÂ’s so-called WS-2 MLRS having a range up to 360km, finally, it turned out to be just a joke.<br><br>KJ2000 compared to E2T, is somewhat like compare a E3 to E2.<br><br>1.	E2T basically still an AEW&amp;C, however, with more roomy A50 airframe, the full function controlling console is on board  KJ2000, makes it a true AWACS.<br><br>2.	Comparing radar system, the 3 Active Phased Array Radar ( APAR, or AESA in US way) antennas are placed in a triangular  configuration inside the round radome on KJ2000 to provide a 360 degree coverage. The E2TÂ’s radar is still a mechanical scanned PD.<br><br>3.	With the more powerful airborne radar, the KJ2000 can search more than 500km in distance, make it only need flow alone ChinaÂ’s coastline within the Theater defense of land based S300 to cover whole Taiwan.<br><br>4.	 KJ2000  is also datalinkable to PLANÂ’s newly deployed type052C DDG with Aegis style 4-ararry APAR antennas . In comparison, the AegisÂ’s SPY-1 is still passive radar. The E2/Aegis combination is the backbone of the US fleet air defense. Likewise, the KJ2000/Type052C combo also gives a edge over the TaiwanÂ’s force.<br><br>Just as 1 of mine Taiwanese friend always mentions to me: Taiwan is too far from the god, and too near toÂ…Emm.. u know whereÂ…<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I agree the outlook for defence of Taiwan is not rosy. Although I personally would prefer to see Taiwan reunified together with a democratic China, this is not likely to be realised for some time, if at all.<br><br>Meantime, it is the lesser evil to maintain status quo and hope that in time, China will move towards some form of democracy.<br><br>If Taiwan's armed forces are not able to keep up with the rapid improvement in the PLA, in time to come, the CCP may just be tempted to retake Taiwan by force eventually. Let's hope this does not happen and some form of balance will be maintained.<br><br>I understand ROCAF took delivery of 2 E2C 2000 recently. This may be part of their strategic plans; however, I don't really know enough about the overall balance of forces across the straits to say whether the Taiwanese are either maintaining or losing their edge. Perhaps someone with better understanding about the subject could provide a little background info here.</div>
