            <div class='col-md body'>EmmÂ… u know some times we just like to talk about the juice Â“hardwareÂ” in a fanÂ’s forum, however, if comes to the reality, then  the boring Â“softwareÂ” side like combat readiness, personnel training canÂ’t be ignored.<br><br>If take consider both the Â“hardwareÂ” n Â“softwareÂ”, ROC force at the moment is still at the lead, however, the time is at the China side.<br><br>Taiwan force operates AWACS much longer than the PLA, and Type052C although with much advance stuffs, itÂ’s still more a trial model than a massive produced DDG. Sure there are many bugs in their software need to be figured out during the coming years by means of extensive exercise and training. To develop a skillful term also need time, LetÂ’s put in safe, at least 3 years are needed when those systems are full operational.<br><br>Regarding the role of ROC forces, I donÂ’t think itÂ’s fair to ask them to keep balance with mighty China. In fact, the US is talking about how long it could hold in face of PLA all dimensions attack, Yankees are asking for 1 month, Taiwan answers 2 weeks at least.<br><br>My guess is as long as Taiwan donÂ’t suicide enough to declare a Formal Â“independentÂ” which will invite PLAÂ’ attack. In any other scenarios, The US forces will come into intervene. Because another ally JapanÂ’s 80% ship traffics are passing by Taiwan. The ChinaÂ’s taking over of Taiwan will bring JapanÂ’s knees down, which means US</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>In my view,  China had learnt a lot in terms of preparing for war and fighting a war.  They had learn the lesson of both world war.  Economy is power.  To fight a war, you must have strong economy support.  See what happen to Germany and Japan during the WW2.  They have the most advance stuff but what happened to the end?  Having advance stuff and using it is one think.  Attrition is another thing.  Replacement rate.  Since ancient time.  attrition war is the most important aspect of warfare.  Who can lose more wins.<br><br>From now till 2008 at least, China will be only interested in building its economy powerhouse.  Till the days in became a econmy powerhouse.  China will not touch Taiwan.  As touching Taiwan will upset the American and the Japanese.  But all these are based on the fact that Taiwan don't stir Sh*t.  The trend in Taiwan is if the presidential Election in 2008 went back to KMT (Mr. Mah YC), there are chances of reunification.  Of course in PRC's term.  But who cares, as long as PRC allows KMT to be the provincial gov't, maintaining the status quo in Taiwan (Just like Hong Kong). I think that will work.  But again, the US will not allow this to happen too.  US need a reason to stay in Asia Pacific.  If China became the Big Bro of Asia, America will be in trouble as nobody in Asia will pay "protection fee" to them.<br><br>That is the reason US is trying to suppress China's economy growth as China have a lot of potential to be No1 if they are focus enough to know what to do.<br><br>History has shown that any empire or superpower can't stay in power for more than 400 years.  Everyone's got a chance.  The Rome, the French, the Brit, the German (very short one) had their.  Now the American and China next.  What you guys think.  Comment...</div>
