            <div class='col-md body'>Tallahasee Democrat News<br>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>Military tests robots for protecting bases<br><br>By Bill Kaczor<br><br>THE ASSOCIATED PRESS<br><br>EGLIN AIR FORCE BASE - The question of whether to use robotic vehicles instead of humans to guard the perimeter of Air Force bases is a no-brainer for Staff Sgt. Miguel Jimenez.<br><br>The Miami airman was plucked from his normal security force duties at nearby Tyndall Air Force Base to help with proof-of-concept testing at Eglin. It is designed to determine if semiautonomous vehicles would be practical for detecting, detaining and battling intruders at air bases and for forward-deployed units.<br><br>"If somebody wants to spend the money and send something like that out there instead of my life, I'm all about that," Jimenez said Tuesday.<br><br>The vehicles being tested cost from $200,000 to $500,000.<br><br>The most expensive is the Jeep-size, four-wheeled Mobile Detection and Response System. MDARS also has drawn interest from other services and is expected to go into production next year, said Walter Waltz, chief of robotic research for the Air Force Research Laboratory at Tyndall.<br><br>MDARS is equipped with radar, television cameras and infrared to detect people, vehicles and other objects. It carries a breadbox-sized, tracked mini-robot called Matilda that can be launched to search under vehicles, inside buildings and other relatively small places.<br><br>Scout is similar to MDARS but fashioned from an off-the-shelf, four-wheeled all-terrain vehicle, giving it added versatility because a human can ride it like a normal ATV when it's not being used as a robot. It also can carry a small tracked robot called Pacbot.<br><br>MDARS and Scout can be equipped with remotely fired weapons. An M-16 rifle and pepper sprayer are mounted on the Scout being tested here.<br><br>"We're taking the war-fighter out of the direct line of attack," said Capt. Adolfo Meana Jr., chief of the concepts division for the Force Protection Battlelab at Lackland Air Force Base, Texas.<br><br>"What we are hoping is the robots will actually detect the enemy first, will receive any of the initial hostile acts," Meana said. "If you shoot the robot we don't care. We know you're there, you're hostile, and we can keep our forces in reserve to move tactically against the enemy. The robots will save our troops' lives."<br><br>The vehicles can be programmed to patrol specific areas on their own and then alert an operator by radio if they come across something suspicious. The machines then can be remotely operated from laptop computers to identify, detain or attack intruders.<br><br>The vehicles have loudspeakers and microphones for challenging and questioning suspected intruders. A Phraselator enables the operator to select from a variety of languages.<br><br>Jimenez said he has found the laptop controls easy to use.<br><br>"If somebody ... uses PlayStation or X-Box, that type of thing, it's right up their alley," Jimenez said.<br><br>-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br><br>Pretty revolutionary yet it throws up a whole can of worms, especially how far can we fight in battle without the "warm bodies".Human systems do play a part as well as such AI units.One thing they might not have is the ability to make a judgement call on the fly.Sometimes, we can't rely too much on machines to do the work which we want carried out. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"></div>
