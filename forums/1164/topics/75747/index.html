            <div class='col-md body'>It is understood that these guys insert and extract in rather bizarre or unconventional ways, mostly mission-specific.<br><br>What could be most interesting is the various delivery methods/platforms available for missions in an urban setting, usually most likely to be pre-emptive raids or hostage rescue whereby deception and ISR are the key factors especially when tackling sophisticated terrorist elements.<br><br>What is then known is that STAR uses an imported tactical 4x4 armoured vehicle for this purpose (also known to be used by Indon)<br>but this has been around since early 1990s as believed.  Of course<br>unmarked vehicles as officially stated in official and unofficial media.<br>However, one could only speculate on the equipment contained within.<br><br>Ultimate of such machines would be the 'transformers' - extensively modified civilian vehicles that are able to quicky be converted through automation into fighting/mission vehicles, and yet still look benign to the public.  Not very far in vision from what the old 80s cartoon MASK portraying such vehicles, albeit it accepted that such technology was really too far-fetched.  Not sure now<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>for STAR, besides the rare heliborne, the vehicle u said is rarely used, it basically have a ladder so the guys can climb up straight from inside the vehicle. the top opening also allows the guys to get to the front of the veh faster. not to forget the sides of the car have attachments to fasten guys so they could be deployed immediately when the veh stops. note that the driver is sitting on the left side of the car instead of right, probably due to the fact that foreign countries driver seast are on the left.<br><br>abt unmarked vehicles, of course have.....in the hostage drama dat spanned 3 hrs+, the newspaper showed STAR guys departing from a 'civillian' van mah....</div>

Although don't know much about how the S'aaret Makal<br>is equipped</div>
