              <p>Hi everybody, so I'm kinda new to this forum, so pardon any rules or guidelines i may broach. The terms and conditions were rather long and arduous :)</p>
              <p>So i guess the body of this text is summarized in the title: What is NS all about? Some background info to put you guys into prespective.</p>
              <p>I'm a [other country citizen~ i'm paranoid :)] Singaporean, who left Singapore when i was 11 1/2 yrs (havnt been back in Singapore for a while), so i'm obliged to return and complete NS (just came to terms with that). I've currently finished my 3rd yr in university, and am going in to do my ippt this dec. Heard that it takes 6 months for MINDEF to process it before you get posted into BMT, which i hope to get into the July intake. </p>
              <p>So i suppose my priority concern is with the ippt. I was wondering if anybody reading has ever ran in the Washington, America (im not from there, but similar) climate compared to the Singaporean. I'm doing my 2.4km right now in 9min, but i heard that running in Singapore is like death, so what should i aim for? Not too worried about the other tests, except for the standing broad jump. Gold's like 242cm? How do you train for that?! I'm jumping at like 220cm right now...</p>
              <p>Secondly, i was wondering if anybody can confirm this; after bmt, can MINDEF post you into the civil defense or the police force? I thought BMT was a military training course, so shouldnt everbody end up in the military? And if so, how do you stay in the military? I mean, in terms of honour and glory, obviously the military's the way to go ;)... just kidding.</p>
              <p>Also, what are the requirements to get into OCS? My dad, way back from the 50's, was a platoon commander for the guards, and he said that if you had a degree, its like a guaranteed pathway to officers training. Is this true?</p>
              <p>In regards, I've heard that people get posted to the different sections of the army based on their degree choice. So, if im in premed, does that mean that there is no chance of getting into the OCS because they will post me to be a medical soldier? I don't really want to be a med officers bitch...</p>
              <p>Thanks in advance,</p>

              <p>Yes, with a degree, you are almost certain to be in OCS. </p>
              <p>However, you will also have to do relatively well for your SIT test.</p>
              <p>Don't worry about being a Medical Officer. If you do not wish to be one, you don't have to be one (Note that this is the only officer role which you can choose not to be).</p>

              <p>Since i will be finishing my degree, will i be put into a recruits group where everybody is like 20yrs over? cuz ill be 20 yrs old turning 21... will feel kinda out of touch with 17/18 yr old boys.</p>
              <p>Also, heard a rumour tht theres a group with just emmigrants in it... is this true?</p>

              <p>Your childish &amp; silly statements makes one wonder what role you were assigned to you during NS. You were also probably not in the SAF &amp; even if you were , then you had clearly not contributed at all to our nation.</p>
              <p>NS  is among other things also nation building. Singaporean 18 year olds from all walks of life ,races , educational &amp; social backgrounds  are thrown into a melting pot giving them a common experience and bonding which makes them , hopefully better citizens of Singapore. I am sure many of us in this forum are proud to have served NS and have become better persons as a result of this experience.</p>
              <p>Looks like you have neither learnt nor benefited from NS.</p>
              <p>The nation is happy that you are no longer serving as a reservist or whatever. Good riddance !</p>

              <p>Haha. I'm really excited. A 2 yr hiatus before med school is a needed break. My dad was a platoon commander for the guards and he has the most interesting stories ever. said it was one of his best times...</p>
              <p>only problem with NS is that if i were in Singapore, id be 100% for it since it builds character and really acts as a learning growth. However, since im not in Singapore, it actually sets me back compared to my current peers. Also, I know nobody in Singapore anymore (other than my relatives), so its gonna be sad. haha, but w/e, just gonna tear up the clubs and local bars.</p>

              <p>For many of us who do NS ,  it  was a  character building exercise both for ourselves and the buddies who went thro the experience together.

              <p>Funny, I saw a lot of Malays in Tekong when I was there.  They were PCs, Sect Comds, Platoon Sgts etc etc.  Maybe you didn't see them cos you didn't open your eyes wide enough or they were all on duty.  Ironically, I saw the most malay servicemen on Tekong than anywhere else.</p>
              <p>Btw, you said you were at Tekong twice?  Both visits or have you done your BMT there?</p>
              <p>As for the TS, don't worry about your age gap. Your section mates will be more excited than anything else and will ask you endless questions about the US and life there.  Of course, your American accent will come under close scrutiny, but it'll be more tongue-in-cheek rather than discriminatory.</p>
              <p>One tip though, don't call the Sergeants "sarge."  Refer to them as "Sergeants."  As for Medical Officer Cadet School, I'm not too sure of that.  I'm under the impression those who disrupted from BMT to study medicine would head back as Medical Officers and serve some kind of bond.  Since your medical school was not paid for by the Singapore government, I doubt they will bond you.  Of course, I won't exclude the possibility of a short tenure there.</p>
              <p>During my stay at Shangri-La Tekong, I encountered quite a few multinational platoon mates.  One guy who studied in an American school in Philippines, 2 Indonesians who came back to serve and another Indian who came back to serve.  </p>
              <p>Enjoy your BMT at Tekong and make friends.  Its fun when you have a whole bunch of dudes to bitch about training with.  And throughout your stay as an NSF in Singapore, you'd definitely meet a lot people from all walks of life.  Get to know them and find out more about this tiny little island.  Maybe you'd figure out what NS is about through your own experience. =D</p>

              <p>high positions for Malays, Indians, etc is for show only..........to show that S'pore is not totally dominated by Chinese.............go to Tekong or ask those new recruits there and see if there are many Malays there.......?</p>
              <p>ever since 9/11 the number of Malays in the Army have plunged off the cliff...........their numbers have skyrocketed in the Police..............so much for the multi-racial bonding BS............</p>
              <p>i was at Tekong twice and there were hardly any Malays there among the new or existing recruits..............i don't think i even saw like 5 of them..............of course, they may all be on MC or hiding those 2 days...........LOL</p>

              <p>My sect comm was a Malay, my understudy sect comm was an Indian Muslim ....and our sister sect also had a Malay dude for sect comm.</p>
              <p>And they all obviously came from Tekong as recruits.</p>
              <p>The exception was really my unit, or more of my SAF arm I served in. There, what you say really applies.</p>
              <p>Like I said, if you did not like your NS, that's too bad for you. I just went for IPPT with some of my buddies, and boy did we enjoy ourselves.<img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Cartoon/teeth.png" alt="teeth.png"></p>
