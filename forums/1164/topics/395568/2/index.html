              <p>So i guess the body of this text is summarized in the title: What is NS all about? Some background info to put you guys into prespective.</p>
              </blockquote>
              <p> </p>
              <p>NS was put in place almost immediately after Singapore was suddenly kicked out of Malaysia as a result of a failed attempt by a small group of political extremists - labelled by LKY as the Ultras in UMNO - to forcibly capture Singapore, by moving two battalions of the Royal Malay Regiment stationed in Johor - in an attempted <em>coup de'tat </em>to seize Singapore political leaders and the entire island.</p>
              <p>The attempt was aborted when news of the attempted move was leaked, and the then UK PM Harold Wilson warned the Malaysian PM - then Tunku Abdul Rahman - that if such an event should take place, UK will be inclined to withdraw its military force that was protecting Malaysia against the Indonesian Konfrontasi military campaign.</p>
              <p>The primary role of NS was surely for the defense of Singapore - and no country can afford to depend on another country for one's own defense.</p>
              <p>This was the hard lesson learnt during WW-2 - when British General C. Percival decided to surrender without putting up any further resistance as he had assumed that the Japanese force was more superior in numbers and had the upper hand.</p>
              <p>After the war, it was discovered that the UK and Commonwealth Military Force defending Singapore had outnumbered the Japanese by nearly 3 to 1 - when most Military Strategist will state that it will require an overwhelming attacking force ratio to overcome a well prepared defense.</p>
              <p>It was the shrewd gamble that Japanese General Yamashita played that won him the prize of capturing Singapore with a smaller force.</p>
              <p>History aside - NS will surely help one to prepare to face any challenges in life, as well as to find out where is the level of physical and mental endurance and how each will respond to situations.</p>
              <p>The training that you receive will benefit you anywhere in the world even if you are not the 'Rambo' type - especially when you can adapt what you have learnt during NS into real life practice.</p>
              <p>NS will surely make you self-reliant, alert, and concious to situations and events around you, and certainly make you aware about the security for yourself and your family - as some Singaporeans had remarked when they encountered disasters during their work or travel overseas. </p>
              <p> </p>

              <p>I'm a [other country citizen~ i'm paranoid :)] Singaporean, who left Singapore when i was 11 1/2 yrs (havnt been back in Singapore for a while), so i'm obliged to return and complete NS (just came to terms with that). I've currently finished my 3rd yr in university, and am going in to do my ippt this dec.

              <p> </p>
              <p>The IPPT test that you will be taking in December is to allow MINDEF to assess your physical status, and to allow them to decide if you are grossly overweight or below the fitness level that will require you to be first sent to "special training" before serious military training begins at BMT.</p>
              <p>This special Pre-NS training can be for a period from 3 to 6 months and depends on your present physical status.</p>

              <p>So i suppose my priority concern is with the ippt.

I'm doing my 2.4km right now in 9min, but i heard that running in Singapore is like death, so what should i aim for? Not too worried about the other tests, except for the standing broad jump. Gold's like 242cm? How do you train for that?! I'm jumping at like 220cm right now...</p>

              <p> </p>
              <p>How tough the weather can be for you will depend on the time of the year that training is conducted.</p>
              <p>The hot, humid and dry months in Singapore are between April through August; while the cooler wet months are usually from November through February. The remaining months can be similarly hot and humid in varying degrees.</p>
              <p>The hottest months in New York city will be close to the climate in Singapore in terms of the dry heat, and although the humidity level in Washington during summer may not be as high as in Singapore, it can be very uncomfortable when you have to emerge from cool spring and then going into cool autmn then into extreme cold winter.</p>
              <p>It is easier to adapt to the heat and humidity in Singapore when you are perspiring most of the time anyway - especially when undergoing vigorous SAF training.</p>

              <p> </p>
              <p>MINDEF will post you into SCDF or the Police Force - if the leadership positions need to be filled, as much as it depend on your medical status and educational records to determine which organisation can benefit from your abilities.</p>
              <p>During the preliminary interview - you will be asked about your attitude and preference for which organisation, and the reasons for your preference.</p>
              <p>Your views will be weighed with the physical and psychological tests that you will be put through during this preliminary call-up at the Central Manpower Base (CMPB).</p>

              <p>Also, what are the requirements to get into OCS? My dad, way back from the 50's, was a platoon commander for the guards, and he said that if you had a degree, its like a guaranteed pathway to officers training. Is this true?</p>
              <p>In regards, I've heard that people get posted to the different sections of the army based on their degree choice. So, if im in premed, does that mean that there is no chance of getting into the OCS because they will post me to be a medical soldier? I don't really want to be a med officers bitch...</p>

              <p>why is every name taken</p>

              <p> </p>
              <p>One thing for sure, you can believe in your dad - If ever you get selected to OCS - believe in it as a challenge to yourself.</p>
              <p>Take the challenge of the leadership role if you believe that you can be better then those who are assigned to lead you when you first get involved with NS. </p>
              <p>If you do make the mark by graduating OCS, measure your opinion again about the leader that you think you can be better, and appreciate him for having given you the inspiration to be one.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Being a graduate does not automatically qualify you for OCS - as much will depend on your performance during BMT, as well as with your physical and mental status in your ability to endure military training.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>If you are entering NS after successfully graduating in Medicine, you can still opt for the combat vocation, as some had done - which resulted in a happier and successful fast track career. Some have even opted to temporarily drop out of medicine after qualifying to be a fighter pilot, and returned to specialised in "aviation medicine".</p>

              <p>Also, what are the requirements to get into OCS? My dad, way back from the 50's, was a platoon commander for the guards, and he said that if you had a degree, its like a guaranteed pathway to officers training. Is this true?</p>
              <p>In regards, I've heard that people get posted to the different sections of the army based on their degree choice. So, if im in premed, does that mean that there is no chance of getting into the OCS because they will post me to be a medical soldier? I don't really want to be a med officers bitch...</p>
              <p>Thanks in advance,</p>
