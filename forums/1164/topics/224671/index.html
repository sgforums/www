Or maybe this is an export version, and if they bid for any of SAF's contracts, might include a different version?</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hmmm........ omparing the design on the fore ground with the one at the back, why the one in front has this non v-shaped hull? Ani significance in such design.<br>Anyway, the ship at the back resembles some wad like DCN's latest stealth frigate design, known as the Gowind series. It is said to have La fayette style stealth with a central mast shaped like a long cone. But this cone we see here resmbles some wad like the MEKO series. Does this mean ST is exploring partnership with the German company? So can we conclude RSN is starting to abandon small ship concept and start to invest on 1000+ ships?</div>

PCG is already doing ship escorting i guess. you dont need a ship with harpoon to shoot down pirates. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br>I think FREMM MAY be a more advanced version(not sure of the capabilities) because it is a rather recent project. might have some italian systems in it since its a joint venture. F124 is a nice ship but perhaps RSN prefer something that is multi-mission since in singapore we are so constrained by manpower until we are all so hype-up abt multi-tasking</div>
