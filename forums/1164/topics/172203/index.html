            <div class='col-md body'>MALAYSIAÂ’S Â“top gunsÂ” flying the Sukhoi Su-30MKM fighter planes may become the first in the world to opt for a different helmet system instead of the standard Russian equipment included in the arms package.<br><br>And while style may not be at the top of the Royal Malaysian Air ForceÂ’s (RMAF) list of criteria when it comes to weapons procurement, the Sunday Mail has learnt that the RMAF is looking at the French MSA Gallet LA100 flight helmet and Ulmer ECT-76VD oxygen mask as standard equipment for the 18 Su-30MKMs when they come on-line middle of this year.<br><br>The RMAF Su-30MKM deal, valued at RM3.42 billion, includes weapons, support equipment and a new avionics suite from Thales.<br><br>The French flight helmet and oxygen mask combination, however, is not the only contender. The Air Force is looking at several options but sources say the French combination is in the lead because the type was recently picked to replace the Russian Zsh-7AP/KM34DII sets used by the RMAFÂ’s MiG-29N fleet.<br><br>E-Clust Technologies Sdn Bhd, MSA GalletÂ’s representative for its LA100 (for use with Russian aircraft worldwide) flight helmet, was contracted to supply 30 units to the RMAF for an undisclosed amount.<br><br>Its chief executive officer, Azman Kamaruddin, when asked, refused to say how many helmet sets are being considered for the Sukhoi fleet but it is believed that the number could be between 60 and 70 units.<br><br>In 2004, the company received a request for information (RFI) from the RMAF for the LA100.<br><br>The RFI stemmed from complaints from RMAF MiG-29 pilots that the Russian set-up they were using were too heavy. RMAF MiG-29 pilots call the Zsh-7 flight helmet Â“The Russian BatuÂ”.<br><br>In a high-G environment, the Zsh-7, which weighs 2.3kg, exerted tremendous loads on the neck and spine. Add a helmet-mounted sight (HMS) and the helmet weighs a neck-snapping 4.8kg.<br><br>By contrast, the LA100 weighs only 940g.<br><br>Because of the high-G loads experienced during air combat manoeuvres, targeting with the HMS on the Zsh-7 was also a problem as the helmet tended to Â“pull awayÂ”, dragging the target reticle along with it.<br><br>The RMAF looked at five types, including the Gentex HGU-68/P of the United States and Helmet Integrated Systems LimitedÂ’s Alpha series of Britain.<br><br>Both manufacturers have a strong presence in the country since the RMAF also uses US and British aircraft.<br><br>After a comprehensive evaluation programme by pilots of the 19th Squadron in Kuantan, the RMAF went with the LA100, citing Â“ease of integration with Russian hardware, outstanding performance under operational conditions, and flexibilityÂ” as the main reasons. Excellent support from E-Clust and MSA Gallet was also mentioned as being a factor.<br><br>The final version of the trial helmets was received in April and the rest were delivered to the 19th Squadron earlier this month. The helmet made its first public appearance at the Langkawi Maritime and Aerospace 2005 exhibition.<br><br>The RMAF MiG-29 helmet deal is significant because it was concluded in 18 months, making it one of the fastest defence procurement processes in the country.<br><br>This also marks the second time that a Western flight helmet has been successfully integrated with Russian equipment. Although the Luftwaffe (German Air Force) has been using the Gentex HGU-55/P helmet for its MiG-29 fleet for some time, the helmet is heavier, weighing 1.8kg.<br><br>Azman said the successful integration of the LA100 with the MiG-29 has opened up new possibilities.<br><br>Â“WeÂ’re getting requests for information within the RMAF for other squadrons operating other fixed-wing types,Â” said Azman. However, he declined to elaborate further.<br><br>Â“Countries like India and Indonesia operate Russian hardware; specifically, the Su-30 multi-role fighter. Operators are looking for helmets that are lighter, more comfortable and easier to maintain and upgrade with equipment from other manufacturers. From an operational standpoint, the LA100 makes perfect sense,Â” he said.</div>
