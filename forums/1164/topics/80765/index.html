HEDP is "dual purpose" so it has both anti-personnel as well as anti-armour (minimal, only enough to penetrate thin-skinned vehicles) effects until HE which only have anti personnel effects.<br><br>What you had watched is basically a "drill", doesn't mean that they will do it each and everytime.<br><br>Not sure what is the standard load-out for a "Grenadier". But in reality very few people actually have involved in "real" ops before. right?<br><br>I don't think the "FlashBang" is a standard issue. The use of Flashbang is predominantly to protect hostages from being harmed. in a SAF FIBUA scenario, everyone in the building is considered hostile, so no need for FlashBang. In a Anti-Terror or HRT or SOF scenario, the above will not apply.<br><br>What you see is probably thunderflash is which will give a big bang and a flash and is suppose to stimulate a Grenade.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Live firing fibua is into a specially made room with lotsa of sandbags and wooden pillars...so that the richochet won't kill us trainees doing the life firing. as far as i could remember we only were allowed to fire two rounds into each corner before siaming for the next guy to come in. How this doctrine would work in real life really beats me since there won;t be those kind of "safety measures" to help us. Furthermore, when we did the flashbang grenade drill, it really made our ears ring - also wonder how that really works in real life cos you do get really disoriented when you have done a few rooms within one building.<br><br>the solution is probably to do more drills - practice made perfect...</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>FIBUA exe in SAF is usually a 2 men team to clear a room, when using blank is full auto but during live firing only semi auto in a very controlled situation , just to give you a feel. Reason , safety.<br><br>But in a real war, many armies dun practice such "room clearing" anymore, becos the enemy could have fortified the building with many booby traps ,explosive and ambushes etc.<br><br>Nowadays, armies simply surround the building, call in arty or airstrike to bomb the building to rubble or at least no enemy fire b4 sending the troops in just to make sure. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_twisted.gif" alt="Twisted Evil" title="Twisted Evil"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>To answer your question, LIVE firing Fibua in Singapore is conducted near Sungei Gedong camp (gotta report to this camp to commence firing here).<br><br>The ball projectile will not bounce around the wall as the fibua room has been designed to prevent this. The side walls are fortified with rubber matting just like those on running tracks. The wall you will be shooting at has dense rubber curtain reinforced with steel mesh. There is state of art ventilation system in place so that we will not be breathing in lead dust.<br><br>Only Ball Projectile up to 7.62mm is permitted to be fired here. No tracers, wadcutters, hollow points etc.<br><br></div>

Remember this is not Swat operations, your mission is to kill not to take alive.<br><br>The Flashbang is use in training in the place of grenades. The grenades is alway thow in first, after the grenade, the team will shoot in from door or window to ensure that all things is dead in auto before anyone even attempt to jump or step in, of course if call for another grenade can be use, by then no problem of richoet. It is not after grenade, and charge in ! that is stupid !<br><br>The HE is high explosive, for general use, while the HEDP is more for light armour or vehicles.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>in my point of view, ex for fighting in BUA is just to let you have a feel of what it is like, as a pioneer AGG during ATEC, we are all over the place waiting for the BN to come. our objective is to hold back the H-hour and cause lots of casualty to the BN, by having nature or man made obstacle for the BN to over come b4 facing us in or near the building or so call village. AGG were given the free play on obstacle as well as real time sit changes for the BN to react. what the eye and ears of the BN get in the morning say at 1000hrs may not be the same 2hrs later. dou ex enemy will be wipe out in the end. oni those unit can't really make it, the ex will be call off by ATEC Comd and carry on to the next mission, it does happen to some unit.<br><br>some may say "hey we have fire on the enemy objective..." so wat, the enemy oso have fire on you when you are moving in. let say you in defend of a BUA and fire start coming in what will you do? think abt it?<br><br>back to BUA, let say in real and in SG i dun think the Army will put one BN in just one BLK or in one town. so does the enemy, be it in a village or HDB like. I just need a PL or less say a section to be in a village or high level building, I have RO which will cause you to get cripple even b4 you can come near me, remember you are in my ground.<br><br>one thing, maybe not all will know or notice, that is b4 any town, building are plan to build, the army of that country are sure to be involve for he know what kind of space is needed for the troops and weapon if a fight had to be in that area.<br><span style="color: darkblue;">Qus: wat is the many small and long vertical opening on top some of the new HDB roofs top for? for decor? the architect like it? and on the small windows in some rooms of the HDB? for ventilation?<br>Qus: the lay out of some building in major juntion? why is it lay out in such way?</span></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Should change to fighting on fortify build up area. FOFBUA.<br>FOFO + FIBUA. New doctrine should come out for this type of ops years back.<br>Look at Gulf War 1 the under ground fortress Sadam has had and look at our Orchard underground link way and the one at Raffles Place link way and many more other link way and tunnel in use or under construction.<br><br>Maybe the PDF's can go more on this as they will be fighting in land.</div>
