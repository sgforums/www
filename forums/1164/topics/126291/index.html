            <div class='col-md body'>As the only Corporal in a platoon with too many sergeants, I got the job of PC runner.<br><br>The runner's job, for those unfamiiliar, is to be the PC's "field secretary". It is a tough job. I carry the heaviest load, I run more distances, eat last and sleep least.<br><br>The heavy load is because of the PRC-77 radio set. This Vietnam War-era radio weighs 12kg on its own not counting the 2 sets of antenae I carry with it.<br><br>Then the spare battery weighs another 2kg.<br><br>Sometimes after we take a rest during route march, I need my buddies to pull me up on my feet as the radio is such a heavy weight.<br><br>Besides the weight the other problem is the handset. During assaults or any fast movement, there is no place to hang the handset without it falling out. So my left hand is permanently holding on to the handset. Sometimes I have to hold it to my ear to listen to or relay messages while running. Sometimes I have to pass the "phone" to the PC.<br><br>Only my right hand can hold the M16. Wish I had a shorter weapon.<br><br>When it comes to eating I have to serve the PC first. When it comes to digging trench or shellscrape I have to dig for the PC and myself. After that when everyone can rest I have to lay comms lines. At night I stay awake manning the comms.<br><br>When everyone pack up I have to collect all the comms lines.<br><br>The only thing that made this job worthwhile was that I was in a very tight platoon and I get a lot of help and some respect from the other guys for doing a job everyone is thankful they're not doing.<br><br>Are there any other runners here?</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>tvdog, kudos to you for being able to go through this without any (or much) resentment. Further credit to your wanting to remain with the Plt even after your PC posted out. It reflects a lot on you and his style of leadership.<br><br>Although there is one thing i'm just uncomfortable with, that he made you dig his trench and shellscrape? i understand he may have had more "impt" things to attend to, but isn't that his personal responsibility? i can remember when Col Sukh was a Bde comd, he dug his own shellscrape AND questioned his Bn COs why their WEREN'T dug....</div>

Plus, there is also the trust built up after several in-camps.<br><br>In civvi life I'm a different person. Some of the other ranks are much more well-off or hold more senior and well-paid posts than the officers and NCOs in civvi life. But it don't matter. Everyone in our platoon - the gang boys, Malay boys, Indian, rich kids...  - all want to work together and excel.<br><br>But the only thing I hate about being a runner is that I would much rather be a rifleman. Not just that I would carry less weight etc.<br><br>I want to be a rifleman cos it's more fun. I actually liked soldiering and all that combat stuff. But actually it's mostly becos I am a huge firearms fan. I am naturally a good shot and always get the Marksman Monetary Award of 200 bucks. Plus another 200 bucks from IPPT : )<br><br>Being a runner is a bit too much of a mental challenge. During a chaotic night FIBUA attack for example you still have to remember all the callsigns, the codewords. And after the firefight when everyone is resting you still have to send sitrep and again, more bloody codewords to fcuk you up.<br><br>Sometimes during an entire night of activity I don't get to fire one single round from my weapon cos I'm so busy with the phone. Furthermore I'm sticking so close behind the PC that technically, if I discharge my weapon I'd probably hit him in the back or deafen him.</div>
