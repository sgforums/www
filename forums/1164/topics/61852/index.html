            <div class='col-md body'><span style="color: brown;">Filtering out the politics of the issues printed here, we can see the tremendous leap that PRC has made in modernising its military.<br><br>With many Western 'High Tech' Industries transferring manufacturing capabilities, technological know how, and quality control procedures into China, and with many Chinese students excelling in their pursuit of knowlege in US tertiary and research institutions, all these can only benefit PRC efforts to modernise the country and its military for competition in the Twenty First Century.</span><br><br><strong>JIANG ZEMIN'S GRIP ON POWER IN CHINA LOOKS SET TO PASS TO NEXT GENERATION<br>Son tipped for key military position </strong>By Ching Cheong<br>EAST ASIA CORRESPONDENT<br><br>HONG KONG - Chinese leader Jiang Zemin appears to be grooming his elder son, Mianheng, for a key post in China's military.<br><br>This is evident from three recent developments, the first being the surprise announcement he was one of three deputy commanders for China's first manned space flight.<br><br>The announcement was seen as a way to ensure credit for the space feat would also go to the younger Jiang, 52, who has a PhD in electronics engineering from an American university.<br><br>The second development was his being named adviser to a task force charged with digitalising weapon, control and command, communication and other systems for the People's Liberation Army.<br><br>This unit is under the direct supervision of the Chinese Communist Party's Central Military Commission (CMC), led by the elder Jiang.<br><br>The latter stood down as State President and Chinese Communist Party General Secretary a year ago, but kept the all-powerful chairmanship of the CMC, giving him last say on important matters.<br><br>Finally, sources say the Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS), of which Dr Jiang is a vice-president, recently agreed with the PLA's General Armaments Department and Shanghai government to build a research centre to String not found, develop micro-satellites for the military.<br><br>While there is no direct evidence of the elder Jiang pushing his son's career, analysts familiar with the Chinese system are sure he is involved.<br><br>A source said it was the CMC which decided recently to set up China's first fully digitalised division under the elite 38th Group Army and assigned Dr Jiang the task of supervising its formation.<br><br><strong><span style="color: blue;">When completed, it will become the world's second fully digitalised division - after the United States' 1st Heavy Mechanised Division.</span><br><br>The micro-satellites are to enhance the PLA's control, communication, command, intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance capabilities.<br><br>They will let the PLA monitor troop movements of potential enemies, enhance targeting and <span style="color: red;">take on an aircraft carrier battle group</span>.</strong><br><br>Dr Jiang is said to be well versed in digitalisation and micro-satellite technology. He graduated from Shanghai's Fudan University, obtained his Master's from the CAS Institute of Semi-Conductors and his doctorate from Drexel University in Philadelphia.<br><br>After returning from the US, he started a number of IT-related companies.<br><br>In 1991, he was named CAS vice-president responsible for research in IT-related dual-use technology. Since then, he has worked closely with the PLA's General Armaments Department.<br><br>Given his meteoric rise, it is an even bet he will eventually head the department and become a key PLA player.<br><br>Straits Time: 14 November 2003<br><br><a href="http://straitstimes.asia1.com.sg/topstories/story/0,4386,219806,00.html?" rel="nofollow">http://straitstimes.asia1.com.sg/topstories/story/0,4386,219806,00.html?</a><br></div>
