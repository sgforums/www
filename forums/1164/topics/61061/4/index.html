            <div class='col-md body'>BTW, this has nothing to do with army but it is a story that gives me the creeps. Good luck to all you night owls...<br><br>My Story: After reading the story written by LadyLurve about the sound of slippers in your office in Peninsula Plaza, i recalled a story.  For all of your information, if ever you found yourself alone and you hear the sound of slippers its best the you dont look around or look behind. Run as fast as you can. That sound is made the Pontianak herself.<br><br>Let me tell you how I know. For your information, I'm staying in Choa Chu Kang Ave 5. The Lim Chu Kang &amp; Choa Chu Kang Cemetary is nearby &amp; theres a "forest" next to my block. It was on a Friday night, it was 3am. I just returned from one of the clubbing sessions with friends. I didn't drink as I was driving. Better safe than sorry. I was feeling tired. Im sure you guys know that if you come home late you can never find a good parking space in a HDB flat. You will end up having to park the car right at the top. So on that day, I parked my car on Level 5.<br><br>My flat is on the next block. Once in level 3, I heard the sound of slippers behind me. As if someone was walking behind me dragging their slippers away. I didnt turned back. I quicken my pace as I feel something wasn't right. The hair on my neck stands. The air was still but there's a sweet smell in the air once a while smells bad. Smells something like Franjipani tree. I'm being muslim but somehow I didnt say any quran verses to fight my fear. I pretended nothing happened. They say these things are like dogs. They will know if you are afraid. I kept on walking till I reached my block. All this while I could hear the slippers sound behind. I never even once look back. This thing followed me all the way.<br><br>At the lift, I met my neighbour. He is an elderman about 45. He told me later he just returned from work. He is policeman. I said hi but he didn't&gt; say anything. He ran towards me, grabbed me by the hand and pulled me into the lift. I was too stunned to ask anything. He asked me, "how are you?" I said, "ok". He asked me, "You didnt see it?" I said, "See what?" He said, "Never mind, we talk tomorrow." I know what he is going to tell me. When we reached 15th storey, out of nowhere we could hear dogs howling. We wasted no time &amp; move in to his house. I slept in his house that night.<br><br>Next morning, I told him before I met him, I heard footsteps following me. Sound of slipper being dragged. He said he saw a pontianak standing behind me about 10 metres away. She was smiling. She must have followed me from the carpark. Then I asked him about the dogs howling. He said not to worry cos' if u can hear the dogs that can only mean that the "thing" is far away.<br><br>But if the dog is whinning that means the "thing" is nearby. No more late nights for me.<br><br>So people, the next time you hear the sound of dragging slippers, that could mean pontianak. So please whenever you walk with a slipper on, please don't drag you feet, sounds like pontianak walking.<br></div>

The place was a mess &amp; the layout was quite different from what we normally see from Levels 2-6...

Personally have gone up to 6th floor, din see anything, just that its abandoned.<br><br>1st story: once during guard duty they went up to 6th floor to keng, then saw a small girl's photograph propped against the wall with 2 green candles in front of it burning.<br><br>2nd story: once after ex or training, they went to the generator store to put back some generators. 3 of them went in the 4th was standing at e doorway when one of the generators at the furthest corner of the room just suddenly started up. The 3 of them(including my friend) kpkb at the 4th guy for being itchy fingered, until he countered back that hes at the oppo corner of the room. The 3 of them had their backs turned to the generator, and they all immediately got stunned when the impact of what the 4th guy was saying. They immediately ran out of the store and left it unlocked.</div>

That is why when sometimes he pee at night in the field and feel that something is around him, he will suddenly turn and unrinate in that direction. So, if you have the "mean MF" mentality as a soldier, they are actually more afraid of you.<br><br>I guess it is right. Think about it. The hair-raising fear you feel is actually generated by yourself in response to an external stimulus. But if you are able to F-care that feeling, the thing cant make use of your vulnerability even if it does a song and dance number in front of you. Plus the fact that you and "it" are both beings as far as the universe is concerned. Our fear of them stems from all past impressions of movies, tales and stories whereby humans are seen to be powerless towards them. If for example, if we grew up with movies and stories about human hunting them down and kicking their ass, the how would you response to an encounter now?</div>
