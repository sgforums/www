            <div class='col-md body'>I have some short descriptions....<br><br>During my bmt, it is said that the lower levels of my coy was "dirty".<br>Some fellow recruits would see a guy in full battle order in the middle of the night sitting in the room... til one night a white figure appear right infront of this recruit and he screamed (the next day ppl were asking about anybody heard a scream). He ran crying to the sergeant's bunk and a sergeant would slp in his section for the following nights. The thing is it happen to the last mono too...<br><br>While my friend was doing guard duty at 2-4am, he encountered a lady voice singing chinese song at a checkpoint which is right beside a golf course. It is very unlikely that someone is there....<br><br>lastly, the arrangement of the platoons of alpha and bravo is from below to top Pl1, 2 and 3, Pl4, 5 and 6 while charlie is from top to bottom, Pl7, 8 and 9. The story is that ppl kept seeing the ghost of this guy who jump from the top floor of charlie coy... and the arrangement was changed to confuse the ghost.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Saw with my own eyes. SBMT March Batch 1990. While marching to cookhouse for dinner one evening, saw all officers and NCOs of Hotel company burn paper money in a rubbish bin in front of COY line. Word was that the beds were moving by themselves with recruits sleeping or sitting on it.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Oh about Pontianak, I was about 10-12 yrs old. Cant remember that well. Used to take the BUS No. 61 or 63?? from Holland Road to Lucky Towers on Grange Road to visit my friend. Those were the days when 61/ 63 is a smaller bus that dont have doors and is empty most of the time. On a couple of occasions, I noticed a Malay lady who always wore traditional clothes and tie a bund with her hair taking the same bus. She wasnt pretty, I remembered thinking that she had a face of a horse. She always got on the bus before and after my stops. And being young and "silly" during that time, I always had a strong feeling that she wasnt human.<br><br>Anyway, since I had a bus card then, I use to take any bus that goes to the bus stop along Botanic Gardens to change any other buses that came along to go to Grange Road - to save time. One day, I was doing the same routine when I noticed that she was also on a non-61/63 bus. I had this strange feeling that she was following me and I know it because when I deliberately alighted at one the stop that is "less popular" most of the time along the stretch of the road. She followed me down the bus! I ran as fast as I could to Marco Polo hotel. From then onwards, I never took the bus again. To go to my friend's house, I detour by taking 191 to Lido Cinema and change a bus or cab to Grange Road.<br><br>But you know what, I am now 34 years old and I still can visual her face and clothes.</div>
