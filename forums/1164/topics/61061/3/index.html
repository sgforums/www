            <div class='col-md body'>my encounter in Tekong was a strange one. If I remember correctly there was a bunk in camp 1 foxtrot company was used as a storeroom but had an extra door on the long side of the bunk. I was told that someone commited suicide in it and haunted that bunk. So some priest came in and suggested to bulit an extra door on the long side of the bunk. It was build to free his spirit into the spiritual realm. The bunk was used as a storeroom from then on.<br><br>One evening, we had a night march and I was the platoon IC. We had to march along side of the bunks and the road took me next to the that particular bunk. I happened to look at my platoon when I passed by that door and I saw my whole platoon's future rank. It shone on their arms and I could see where they were posted to. After that night's march, I told 5 them what I saw and where they were heading after passing out of BMT. True enough, they were posted as I had said.<br><br>Strange as it seem that I saw no ghost throughout my whole bmt. It was only in my unit that I had constant encounters. I had to often battle with them. My unit was a former hospital where the mortuary was there in world war 2. Anyone from Seletar camp?<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>This is something I experienced myself.<br>'A' coy 99' BMTC 1<br><br>It was the night before the 24km POP route march. We were to wake up around 5am+ to prepare. So feeling excited and anxious, I had a light sleep. Midway though my sleep, I was awoken with sounds of banging on a metal cupboard in the bunk, I took a look at my alarm clock and it's about 4am++.<br><br>As I slept at the end of the bunk (@ the window), I can hear that the noise was coming from the other end of the bunk. I decided to ignore it at first thinking might be my bunkmate opening his cupboard, but the noise is persistant for a few minutes!! So decided to take a peek towards that direction. And guess what, I saw nothing and the sound is still there. Slowly I crept back into my blanket hoping it'll end soon. And finally about 5 mins of terror, the noise's gone.<br><br>So after a fellow bunkmate turned on the lights when he woke up, I walked up to the guy sleeping beside that cupboard where the sound came from and I ask him, "did you heard sounds from your buddy's cupboard?" And indeed he had......... Eerie....<br><br>I truly believe SAF knows something about these weird encounters in tekong. When Sispec first moved from Pasir Laba to Rocky Hills in Tekong, all our bunks and beds are blessed. How do I know? Coz' all our bunks and beds had some rice all over it.<br><br>During my unit time, my friend had an encounter in Lim Chu Kang too. But I only know parts of the story so not very clear. Maybe in the future when I know the whole story, I'll post it again</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Interesting to read all the posts - but for myself, I've never had any such ghostly encounters in NS or ICTs. I've been thru all sorts of training, including training on all areas and days in Tekong, and I have photos of my section resting on grave stones in Taiwan even.<br><br>I didn't do my BMT in Tekong - but I have to admit one thing - of all the training grounds I've been in - Tekong seems to be the creepy and unusual one. I remembered one particular night exercise there - it was just too quiet for my liking. There was not even sounds from any insects. Had to wisper to my buddy just to break the silence.<br><br>On a lighter side of things - I almost stab a wild boar that came a little too close to me during a night time exercise. Was in my arc of fire - but I knew it wasn't the "enemy" or human, so I had my bayonet out in my hand.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I've been to quite a few camps in my NSF days. But i would say that the place that gives me the most creeps is TEKONG! Once you are on that island, you feel different.<br><br>2nd on the list is that old temple behind lim chu kang cemetary near some PUB facility. Forgot the exact place.

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by HENG@:</div><div class="quote_body">u in stagmont?<br>heres a personal experience back in march or feb.<br><br>We have a multi purpose hall above the cookhouse. Its pretty old, and within the hall there are some storerooms which u can only enter from the hall itself. I knew the storeman in charge of the sports store. Once i was supposed to go collect some stuff from him, but he wasn't around. I had a rec with me, both of us wanted to slack a bit, so instead of going back to e office, we decided to wait in his store, since he never locks the doors. The doors were the normal double doors with a door latch, which opened outwards. The hall itself is enclosed by steel shutters when its not used. That day when we were there, it was all closed up. We entered the hall by a small access door at the back of the hall.<br><br>We went in, and i stood beside some stores facing the center of the room, my guy was sittin on e table in the store facing the door. While we were talking, he suddenly shifted his eyes to look at something beside me. I turned and saw the door opening slowly and steadily outwards. Then as we were looking, it stopped, then slowly and steadily closed back. Just b4 it closed completely, it suddenly slammed shut with a loud bang. That spooked me and i got him out of the store immediately. There was no wind, since the whole hall is enclosed, and the door to the hall is within the hall itself. And i am doubly sure its not the wind because the door opened OUTWARDs 1st, since it can only open outwards, and the store itself is also enclosed. </div></blockquote>did u try the door later that?? aiya....certain wind can also come into the hall mah. Want to KENG still scared...hhaa</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>This happened during the lunar 7th month, at Tengah, near to Limchukang cemetry. My fren whoose standing guard alone at the guardhouse, just past midnight. Suddenly he witnessed something really spooky...  The fan that's on the ceiling is long-spoilt, and it can't be switched on. Even the blades are long gone. But it slowly started spinning out of no reason. -there's no wind(as the guard house is very small and enclosed) He then tried the switch, flicking it on and off a couple of times to try to stop it. But it didn't stop. Instead it just continue spinning for a couple of mins before stopping by itself.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Just like to share with you guys, I'm lucky enough not see anything 'ghostly' in during my stay-in at 5 different camps in my NSF life. But I admit taking part in creating these 'ghostly' experiences to newbies to my unit.. hee hee..<br><br>Some tricks includeÂ–<br>* Dragging metal chains at 3am, along the corridor, just outside of the bunks.<br>* Slamming cupboards in the middle of the night, that's un-used and next to that of those newbies.<br>*Tying white bed-sheets using fishing line to the back of jeeps, and drive it past the guard houses (to scare the wits out of the guys standing gates)<br>*Making calls to guardhouses and simulating different characters(sometimes as a gay, sometimes ghastly..)<br><br>hee.. had hell-of-a-good-time doing all these! Whoeverer said NS is never fun??<br></div>
