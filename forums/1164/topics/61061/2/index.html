            <div class='col-md body'>this one happeded to my platoon ... way back in 89'.<br>I was in Echo Co. camp 1 Tekong in 89'.  One week end my section was doing guard duty and for some of you fellas who can remember echo co., its one of the rare cos that had 2 loos for the last platoon, platoon 19.  i.e. one loo on each side of the bunk.<br>well, I was not on the guard detail but some of my platoon mates were.  they passed by one of the loos in the afternoon and found that the loo light was on.  So they went in to turn it off.  My platoon mate then said that the basin tap was turned on and when he turned it off, one of the shower taps turned on.  The 2 guys in the guard detail then walked back to the guard room and reported the incident to the duty officer who, the 3 of them went to the loo and the officer verified the incident.<br>the unexplained points :<br>- it was a weekend and there were no one else in camp 1 except the guards<br>-   it was in the afternoon and the lights were turned on<br>-   the 2nd time the guards and the DO went back, the lights were turned on again<br>-   the taps turning on incident occured 2 times in a row.<br><br>From what I know, the DO reported this incident and it was filed.  The joke was when the platoon booked in the following Sunday, this incident was told to us only on Monday.  We never looked at the loo the same way again.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Would like to share a story (only that you don't publish my real name) that I experienced personally during my army days. This was 1991.<br><br>After BMT, I was posted to School of Signals at Stagmont Camp for 7 weeks of  Basic Signaler Course. Camp was an eye-opener as it was like a holiday camp compared to the crummy SBMT (well, I have another one on that) where I came from.<br><br>OK, as signalers, we have to go through radio and line course. Line means that we use field telephones instead of mobile radio sets. The most difficult part is to "lay the line" as we call it - basically run from point A to B and connect 2 telephones while making sure we give enough slack for maintenance. In Line training, there is this exercise to lay it in built-up areas, which is basically a building.<br><br>Off we went on a short ride to this abandoned govt blocks in Chua Chu Kang. It was an afternoon. We were split into 12 teams and 2 teams are tasked to lay line all the way to the 6th floor of each abandoned building by entering from the two staircase entrances located at each side of the building. To my best recollection, there were 6 blocks, 5 together and an isolated one about 50 meters away down a slope. My team together with another were bloody unfortunate to be tasked to lay Block 6 - yup, the isolated one. Was not so much about goblins and ghosts then but for the fact that each team is timed on their mission and the last team has to do push ups on the hot ground full of sands and stones - a real bummer. We had to work faster.<br><br>I was detachment-in-charge and my responsibility was to run as fast as I can to the block, run up the stairs to the 6th floor, cist the cable and connect it to the phone, check communications and run back to report with my mates. The other 2 of my mates have the responsibility of covering up the line and allow enough slack. As I ran like hell up the stairs, something made me look back at the corner on the 4th floor. I saw nothing. When I reached the 6th floor and started working with my pliers, I heard a female voice talking in the empty rooms. Pressed for time, I was not thinking much about it. But as I was finishing my job, the talking which I could not make out what was said as they were kind of mumblings, grew louder and it sounded like that female was losing an argument (you know how they are). Next thing I heard was a loud bang, exactly like slamming of a door. What made me froze for 3 seconds was that several other doors also slammed shut one after another.<br><br>At that point, I have finished my job, and ran downstairs by jumping each staircase from the 2nd or 3rd step. I didn't say anything because not being the last detachment to report back took utmost priority for me. When the exercise was almost done, we needed to collect back the field telephone and cables. I kind of suggested to my mates that we should share the work and one of them should go up and claim these items. (Yup, I'm that kind of dude then).<br><br>We went back to camp, returned the stores and waited for dinner. I still didn't tell anyone. In the bunk, I was sitting on the floor opposite this guy from the team that was laying the line at the other end of block 6. Thinking back, they had a rawer deal as their staircase entrance was facing the woods while mine was facing the command centre. Anyway, this guy look real pale and green. Then I sprang my questions. "Did you lay block 6?", "Did you hear any woman's voice?" The guy looked at me and was totally shocked out of his pants! He couldn't speak for at least 1 min and then told me his story.<br><br>When we were collecting back the equipment, this dude was unsure if his detachment ic was upstairs doing it, so he ventured upstairs to look for him. While he was at halfway between the 5th and 6th floor staircase, he called out the ic's name and got a female voice replying "Wo zai ze li" (I am here). Straightaway he dashed back downstairs. We tried to analyze and rationalize it because it was broad daylight (sunny and hot) and we had a female instructor present during the exercise. But all the time she was at the command post. Could it be a human hiding in the rooms? Finally, we approached our female sergeant (instructor) and told her our experience. She confirmed that she was at the command post all the time and the blocks are vacant. Later that evening, she revealed that we were not the only ones that "complained" about it. Apparently, previous platoons also encountered unexplained things there. After this event, the place was not used for any future line training exercises.<br><br>The story did not end...<br><br>1992 - I was in a unit and involved in this big division exercise just before my ROD. My unit was in Tekong and I had ultra sinang duties. With nothing to do at night, I sat around a bunch of store man and drivers listening to ghost stories. There was this driver that said that during his teenage days, they like to peep at lovers making out at night. One of the hotspots then was a bunch of abandoned govt blocks in Chua Chu Kang. But there was one incident whereby this girl was ditched by the boyfriends and she hung herself in one of the rooms. I couldn't believe what I have heard!<br><br>Immediately, I asked him to describe the place...it was the same BLOCK 6!!!<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>It seem that this thread has attracted a lot of non-military nuts here,I think I should continue with saga of the old Charlie coy Tekong Camp1 stories, so to scare the panties out of all the Gu Liang here <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br>Quote from the same forum reply to the one I hv posted earliar:<br><blockquote>&lt;&gt;<br><br>There seem to be an error here. Its Bravo Company, March intake. The OC is Capt Rennie Wee from Commandos. After this incident he had an accident in which he fell off the Officer Bunk located next to the cook house and was down graded for three months.<br><br>I want to relate another road march death, this time from Hotel Company. The recruit was found the next day at the side of the route. He was partially buried, and only through a very lucky encounter that his body was found. Till today SIB still classify the case as unsolved.<br><br>I can't tell you much specifics as it happened almost 20 years ago but it occured 3 months after the Charlie Ompany incident. When I was at Mowbrey Camp, its still a hot discussion topic, but nobody talks about the Charlie Compnay incident. Too bad luck to discuss...</blockquote></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>The next one verified the story:<br><blockquote>First time I heard of the "happenings" at Charlie Coy was back in Mar 1984 where I was doing my BMT. While going to the cookhouse, we say the instructors praying under the tree (candles, incense, joss paper etc) next to the chin-up bars. Then we heard from Charlie reecruits that one of the company mate was found sleeping in the toilet with his face in the toilet bowl.<br>1 month later while on our 24km road march, my OC Cpt Rennie Wee who was running ahead of the company saw one soldier walking by himself, he ran towards him and shouted/ asked him why he was marching alone and where were the rest of his platoon. The soldier turned around and my OC reaslised it was the dead recruit (not sure if it was the Charlie recruit or the Hotel recruit who had died only a few weeks earlier)<br><br>My OC who is commando train but obviously did't have a commando heart took a hasty retreat and kept quiet until end of road march. Then one week later, he had an accident and was downgraded.</blockquote></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>so sorry... heres the legend of datuk...<br><br>The last sultan of singapore was ousted, and exiled himself on tekong, i heard from my OC, this old Master Warrent, who'd just recently made senior warrent we've heard...<br><br>Seems after this sultan died on ubin, his body was brought back to mainland singapore for burial. B4 his death, he was known to all on tekong as datuk, as he was still influencial enough. One year, a lot of the villagers dreamt about datuk, telling them his birth anniversary was coming up, and he wanted to watch chinese opera. Seems most people ignored it, and a village promptly burnt to the ground. After this, the villagers got a opera troupe in to perform, and every year after that. When I was there for BMT, there was some sort of opera thingy performing during one of the days... so i guess there is some truth to it.<br><br>The villagers also have claimed to see datuk wandering along the piers, now known as the old pier, not the tekong ferry terminal. n fact people still claim to see him now and then. Once the villagers had obeyed him, and brought in the opera every year on his birthday, he supposedly watched over all the inhabitants of tekong. During the jap occupation, the japs gathered up the villagers and lined them up along the jetty to be excecuted. The villagers were wailing "Datuk Tolong Datuk Tolong(Datuk please Datuk please)" The japs, to show their patriotism, they raised a rising sun flag b4 the excecutions, but the flag string snapped and the flag fell down to the ground. It was raised again, but snapped again. The 3rd time it was raised, it snapped yet again. By then, the japs who were also superstitious, were feeling uneasy, and asked the interpretors what was going on. That when the interpretors relayed the story fo datuk to the japs, and the japs decided to spare the villagers for fear of offending Datuk.<br><br>Now my personal experience with Datuk is in a sense, astounding. Astounding enuf that i now firmly believe in the legend. My BMT was the obese batch. Every other week we had to undergo a sort of classification test, where criterias were to be met to be able to book out. For 3 successive tests, i was confined the whole weekend. Then, for the 4th test, that weekend I had a friend throwin' a party. I really wanted to book out badly... 'cause i wanted to go. Well... the criteria was to either lose at least 15kg from my original weight i think, pass the 2.4km run, or do at least 4 chin ups. I only lost 8 kg b4 i came up against an invisible barrier... my chin ups i managed 3, from previously 0, my 2.4km run, last timing was 13.3something... i was determined to pass it, but i knew i was gonna be confined... and i was very sad. As I ran, i was saying under my breathe "Datuk Tolong" and my timing for that day miraculously was 11.34. It was barely a week since i ran 13.3something and i managed a 2 minute improvement within less than a week! incredible? my platoonmates all said i was suddenly running very fast that day. So i met one of 3 criterias, but it wasn't enuf. I needed to meet at least 2. Well.... i was still disappointed, but feeling good about passing the 2.4 in good time.<br>That night i did guard duty. Next day, when i returned to my bunk, the 1st thing my buddy told me was: "Buddy! you're going home!" i told him to stop joking, but he told me it was true. Seems the OC had suddenly revised the system... instead of meeting fixed criterias, he was allowing those who had shown significant improvements to book out, and those who met the criterias, but who hadn't improved much since the start, were confined. When I heard that, I knew Datuk had heard, and helped. I got to go home, n go to the party. Ever since, I've told all my friends going into tekong BMT about datuk, and how they never know they might be able to get a little extra help from him.<br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"><br>Terima Kasih Datuk!</div>
