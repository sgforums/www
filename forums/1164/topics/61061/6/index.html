            <div class='col-md body'>A Platoon mate told me his recent experience.....<br><br>He was on scout course at that time, and was navigating around lim chu kang. ( Guys who trained there should know this place, where the poyan reservoir is. The track that heads north, the ending point where it acts as a dyke. ) His group came upon this old hut with only it's partitions around, no roof. It was getting dark and they decided to harbour around there. At midnight, a tune with a female voice starts singing.... they were hearing it as if from a distance. My friend:" Everybody shut up! ". He wanted to listen more clearly and just before he want to say anything, his friend:" Now you shut up, everybody go sleep ". At that time, my friend was still maintaining comms. After the navex, the team that comms with my friend said:" Wah! you all balls beri big, dare to bring radio outfield still on so loud over the comms? ". What the other team heard was the voice was very loud, however, what my friend heard, was from a distance.<br><br>Came ex.pegasus, he was deployed as blockforce at the same area. Again, the tune starts singing. It lasts around 15mins to 30mins. The same as his previous experience.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hi,<br><br>Share my reservist ghost story with you guys.<br><br>Back in Dec 2002, we had an 4 days 3 night exercise at Pulau Tekong. On the first day, we digged trenches facing Malaysia. On 2nd day, most trenches were ready. On that 2nd night, as I was inside my trench alone, the time was about 2am, I saw a few white translucent objects flying in front of such trees. There was a bright moon that night. At first I thought I was dreaming. I later confirmed with anothe platoon mates that he also seen white objects flying in front of the trees. One of my platoon mates even seen a soldier like white object sitting nearby.<br><br>Maybe we were all tired... Maybe we were all dreaming ...<br><br>The white objects btw were flying in the air. I couldn't see their faces. They were about 20m away from me. I wasn't scared then as I was really tired as I didn't sleep for 2 days.<br><br>Regards</div>
