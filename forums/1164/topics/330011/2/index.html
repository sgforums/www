              <p>Report from BBC on the situation in Somalia :</p>

              <p> </p>
              <p>The seas off Somalia, close to busy shipping routes, have some of the highest rates of piracy in the world. The country has been without a functioning central government for 17 years and has suffered from continual civil strife.</p>
              <p>Malaysian Deputy Prime Minister Najib Razak said the ships being deployed would provide protection for five MISC Berhad vessels, and would not launch rescue operations.</p>
              <p><strong>Counting ships</strong></p>
              <p>Officials in the semi-autonomous Somali region of Puntland say the ships are being held at the port of Eyl, a lawless outpost controlled by gangs.</p>
              <p>Puntland's minister for mines, who is leading a delegation to investigate the hijackings, told the BBC Somali Service from a hill overlooking the port that he could count eight captured vessels. He said another two were reported to be on their way to Eyl.</p>
              <p>The delegation had spoken to local elders, he said, but it had not approached the pirates. The latest vessel to be hijacked was an Egyptian ship which was reported missing on Thursday. Earlier this week a French sailing boat with two crew was seized. Pirates holding that boat are reportedly seeking a ransom of more than $1m (£0.56m).</p>
              <p>Puntland's ports minister said after the capture of the French boat that pirates in the region were well-armed and employ a lot of people.He said there was little co-ordination between those trying to tackle them.</p>
              <p>In June, the UN Security Council voted to allow countries to send warships into Somalia's waters to tackle the pirates, but the ports minister complained that international vessels "don't intervene".</p>

              <p>Quite true. I just don't like their mentality. Mainly having one race in the army isn't going to help. Also, like what you said, they are rather indecisive.</p>
              <p>Aiya, those who can't get in terms with the fact that not everyone is black are just babies sucking their thumb.</p>

              <p>Hello all, I am back after a nap.......</p>
              <p><a class="tinymce_control" href="330011?page=2#"><img src="../../../images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/ccmathteam.com/biggrin.png?1212956094" alt="Emoticons"></a></p>
              <p>About the RSN.</p>
              <p>Yes, this Navy was the best in chasing away Vietnamese refugees.</p>
              <p>Malaysian Navy allowed refugees to land at Pulau Bidong and the Indonesian Navy helped them land at Pulau Galang. Singapore Navy merely gave the refugees food, water and then led them out in their leaky boats to the South China Sea to drown by the hundreds. Don't believe me? Ask the old timers. The RSN all have blood on their hands, the blood of the drowned Vietnamese refugees, many of whom were actually oversea-Chinese.</p>
              <p>And the Singapore Commandos.......yes, the heros who killed the Pakistani hijackers at Changi  Airport,  hijackers armed to the teeth with butter knives and forks.....all killed even when they could not defend themselves. By the way, their leader had just become the new Pakistani President yesterday. Let's see if he has forgiven Singapore.</p>
              <p>Anyway, I am waiting for some action at the Gulf of Aden....these are real heros who fought in real battles</p>
              <p>Cheers <a class="tinymce_control" href="330011?page=2#"><img src="../../../images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/ccmathteam.com/biggrin.png?1212956094" alt="Emoticons"></a></p>
