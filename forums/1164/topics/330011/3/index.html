              <p>About the RSN.</p>
              <p>Yes, this Navy was the best in chasing away Vietnamese refugees.</p>
              <p>Malaysian Navy allowed refugees to land at Pulau Bidong and the Indonesian Navy helped them land at Pulau Galang. Singapore Navy merely gave the refugees food, water and then led them out in their leaky boats to the South China Sea to drown by the hundreds. Don't believe me? Ask the old timers. The RSN all have blood on their hands, the blood of the drowned Vietnamese refugees, many of whom were actually oversea-Chinese.</p>
              <p>And the Singapore Commandos.......yes, the heros who killed the Pakistani hijackers at Changi  Airport, hijackers armed to the teeth with butter knives and forks.....all killed even when they could not defend themselves. By the way, their leader had just become the new Pakistani President yesterday. Let's see if he has forgiven Singapore.</p>
              <p>Anyway, I am waiting for some action at the Gulf of Aden....these are real heros who fought in real battles</p>

              <p>Well, i hardly call getting pelted by rocks or bullets In an Apc "fighting". Peacekeeping force is peacekeeping force, u can bend it all you want and try to squeeze every drop of credit u didnt earn. Excuse me if RSN dont perpetuate violence, nor wish to make a big hooha over every little thing.</p>
              <p>And if rmn is as gd as you said, y didnt they take those vietnamese in? And if rmn are so insistent on helping those people, y did they let the refugee leave?</p>
              <p>Very good distraction by saying the blood is on RSN's hands though, or for throwing up distractions when u cant defend your points. Very malaysian. Feel free to wallow in ur past achievements.</p>

              <p>U piece of shit. U dont even know half the bloody story then u post here like u noe any shit about it. These effing hijackers were threatening to kill the passengers on board if the Singapore authorities do not acede to their requests. Are we bionic humans? Are we to know, back with 1991 technology, that they were armed with knives and forks? Did we know if they were totally incapable of killing the hostages? Use ur fucking brain, if u have any. Those commandos did the country and her people proud. They killed these scumbags in 30 sec, rescued every single passenger and crew on board. I think that if any Malaysian airline get hijacked, the best the Mudland govt can do is to offer barrels of PALM OIL as payment. Just so u know, these faggots had to resort to paying for their Su-30MKM jets partly in palm oil. Bloody useless people, and so are u.</p>

              <p>Being a hijacker will surely endanger your life, common sense. Even you don't bring any weapon, the sercurity force will shoot you down. One stupid life to secure the lifes of so many innocent people, good deal you know.</p>

              <p>ok some correction :</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>he he i think  some of you to young to remember this.. The malaysian not only allowed the vietnamese to live in an island as a refugees, they also provide all the basic necessities and protection untill it is save for them to go back home or  move to a third country..such as america... thousands of them are saved...unknown  to most of us..most of the  vietnamese that RSN stopped were also diverted to malaysia..RSN escorted them safely into malaysian waters and the RMN continue to escort them back to the island...there were only one cases of a boat sunk..after being escorted out by RSN..but that is not our fault.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>second correction.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Its not KD Pahang that went to somalia...the malaysian government deceptively lied...instead it was the KD Mahawangsa...as we know this ship are capable capacity for 600 troops, cargo space 1,000 cubic meters, 10 20-ft containers, 680 square meters vehicle space..the entire frakking brigade.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>that said.... i think the sh!t allready hits the fan...it is unconfirm but i think malaysian navy already started engaging the pirate...</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>By Abdiqani Hassan <br>Sun Sep 7, 5:30 PM ET<br><br>BOSASSO, Somalia (Reuters) - An unidentified warship off pirate-ridden Somali waters captured 14 pirates and destroyed their boat, a minister of the northern Puntland region said on Sunday.<br><br>Abdulqadir Muse Yusuf, fisheries minister for the semi-autonomous region said the pirate vessel met a warship <strong>"that we think could be American"</strong> and all the pirates on board were captured and their boat destroyed.<br><br>However, the U.S. Fifth Fleet, based in Bahrain, said <strong>there was no American involvement in the operation</strong>.</p>
              <p><br>Yusuf said local authorities <strong>were still investigating the identity of the warship</strong>."</p>

              malaysian not only allowed the vietnamese to live in an island as a
              refugees, they also provide all the basic necessities and
              protection untill it is save for them to go back home or  move
              to a third country..such as america... thousands of them are
              saved...unknown  to most of us..most of the  vietnamese
              that RSN stopped were also diverted to malaysia..RSN escorted them
              safely into malaysian waters and the RMN continue to escort them
              back to the island...there were only one cases of a boat
              sunk..after being escorted out by RSN..but that is not our
              fault.</p>

              <p>Yup, many Vietnamese detained on the island subsequently returned to Vietnam. Cause i got a good friend who is in NZ , his father was caught by RSN , sent to MY by the RMN n then deported back to Vietnam , which he again managed to smuggle the first generation of vietnamese to NZ n Aus. Thats why he is a respected elder in the Vietnamese community. He even speaks a bit of Malay due to the detention. lol Yeah n it was like ages ago.. before i was born.</p>

              <p>Are you on drugs? Your posts of late seem to be less rational then usual.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>FYI the decision to storm the aircraft was made after the hijackers threatened to set fire to the aircraft if their demands were not met and to that effect started taking steps to do so.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>You don't need a bomb to kill a lot of people in a plane, all you need to do is to set a fire and the entire thing literally becomes an oven. In any case there was a real threat to the safety of the hostages and hence the hijackers had to be put down.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Basically the hijackers came in unprepared and played thier cards too long, if you ask me more of their fault then the professionalism of the STAR members that took them down.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>On the other hand, I don't see the need to go about tooting my horn about each and every single thing the SAF does because it is their job as a military.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Also idwar, you should realize that your attempts to hijack the actions of your fellow countrymen that are serving their nation by putting themselves in harms way into some shallow propagandistic nationalistic drive to make yourself feel good and "patrotic" is actually a insult to what they do. Prehaps you should go reflect on your actions.<span style='font-size: 11pt; font-family: "Goudy Stout";      '><span style="color: #000000; font-family: Times New Roman;"> </span></span></p>

              <p>About the RSN.</p>
              <p>Yes, this Navy was the best in chasing away Vietnamese refugees.</p>
              <p>Malaysian Navy allowed refugees to land at Pulau Bidong and the Indonesian Navy helped them land at Pulau Galang. Singapore Navy merely gave the refugees food, water and then led them out in their leaky boats to the South China Sea to drown by the hundreds. Don't believe me? Ask the old timers. The RSN all have blood on their hands, the blood of the drowned Vietnamese refugees, many of whom were actually oversea-Chinese.</p>
              <p>And the Singapore Commandos.......yes, the heros who killed the Pakistani hijackers at Changi  Airport, hijackers armed to the teeth with butter knives and forks.....all killed even when they could not defend themselves. By the way, their leader had just become the new Pakistani President yesterday. Let's see if he has forgiven Singapore.</p>
              <p>Anyway, I am waiting for some action at the Gulf of Aden....these are real heros who fought in real battles</p>

              <p>not to encourage a nationalist flame war here but, having trained with malaysian infantry and seen them first hand. for the record, the malaysian RRR 1st batallion. i wouldnt be chest thumping all that here. most of them are ordinary blokes just like our conscripts. and surprise surprise ! their pay is about equivalent too. we have marked differences in the way we operate but if you strip away all the training, gear , tactics,education ,identity and nationality, we arent really all that different.</p>
              <p>Just to gently remind you armchair generals something, you may have a bigger tank , a faster jet or a more capable boat. but at the end of the day, the human being operating that isnt really much different on either side of the causeway. we have more in common ground then in difference.</p>
              <p><br>to engage in a flame war about singapore and malaysia is about as productive as comparing the taste of chalk and cheese (not that i want to try that in in any given case)</p>
              <p>idwar, no offence here intended , but before u talk about how the MAF is ready and raring to jump into action with pirates off the coast of somalia, do remember the asian tsunami relief response. singapore does not lack the capability to project or flex its military muscles. It merely lacks the motive to act.</p>
              <p>do not confuse lack of motive with a lack of power or the will to exercise it. very dangerous misconception to have.</p>
