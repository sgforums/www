Dual-warhead HEAT defeated by external SLAT n/or Chobham  armour creating multiple layers of armour.<br><br>Crew in centre of vehicle offered max protection/survivability.<br><br>Electro-Thermal Chem tech offers 50% improvement in gun performance - allowing smaller calibre (lighter) main gun n more ammo. Gun would be better than current 120mm guns.<br><br>Better mobility than current MBTs.<br><br>Low observable tech centred around RAM/shapping/composites.<br><br>Network-centric battlefield control tech offers better crew awareness.<br><br><strong>Electric Armour</strong><br><br>The ubiquitous RPG-7 can be picked up for a mere US$10 in most of the world's trouble spots but is capable of destroying a tank n killing its crew. When the grenade hits the tank, its shaped charge warhead fires a jet of hot copper into the target at around 1000mph.<br>It's capable of penetrating more than a foot of conventional solid steel armour.The new electric armour is made up of a highly-charged capacitor that is connected to 2 separate metal plates on the tank's exterior. The outer plate, which is bullet proof n made from an unspecified alloy, is earthed while the insulated inner plate is live.The electric armour runs off the tank's own power supply. When the tank commander feels he is in a dangerous area, he simply switches on the current to the inner plate.When the warhead fires its jet of molten copper,it penetrates both outer plate n insulation of the inner plate. This makes a connection n thousands of amps of electricity vaporises most of the molten copper. The rest of the copper is dispersed harmlessly against the vehicle's hull.But despite the high charge, the electrical load on the battery is no more than that caused by starting the engine on a cold morning.In recent demonstration of the electric armour,an APC protected by the new British sys survived repeated attacks by RPG grenades that would normally have destroyed it several times over.Many of the grenades were fired from point blank range but the only damage to the APC was cosmetic. The vehicle was driven away under its own power. The use of electric armour will protect it against all shaped-charge warheads including artillery n tank shells.<br></div>

That said, while infantry will always been the queen of the battlefield, you need armour to support them in urban ops. Infantry helps to take out the RPG teams, while the armour helps protect the infantry from snipers and enemy GPMGs.</div>

A question that has been repectedly asked for decades, almost since the birth of tanks.<br><br>I advice reading "Panzer Leader", a copy I saw recently at Border's.<br>It is by none other than the grandfather of German lightning warfare Blitzkrieg, Guridian. He had an arguement of why you still need tanks even when they are not totally invulnerable.<br><br>The answer is in tactics. Namely, massing of armour, surprise, use of terrain, attacking the weak points of defense, movement shifter than the enemy can recover.<br><br>Tanks are just tools. Anyhow use a tool wrongly, you wouldn't get the desired results. Use a tool correctly, you would get the result the tool is designed to perform.<br><br>If you don't fear tanks, then you have never been an infantry trooper seeing  tanks in action  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br></div>
