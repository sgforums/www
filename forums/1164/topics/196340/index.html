            <div class='col-md body'>Learning about calories to lose weight and gain weight<br><br>Most people who decide to lead a healthier lifestyle go on traditional diets. The truth is, however, that 95% of those who go on such<br>diets fail; what's worse, they often end up in worse shape than when they started.<br><br>Diets are both ineffective and potentially harmful; long-term health-oriented programs should replace them.<br><br>Low calorie diets, result in muscle loss, in preference to fat so that the most useful tissue is preserved for times of starvation. Fat<br>produces 9 cals of energy per gram compared with only 4 cal per gram produced by your muscle tissue.<br><br>However, muscle determines the overall metabolic rate of the body, so if muscle is lost, the metabolic rate will be reduced. This means<br>that when the dieter returns to a normal pattern of eating again, the lower metabolic rate will result in rapid weight gain.<br><br>The other problem with having a low level of lean muscle tissue is the feeling of fatigue, when doing simple exercise tasks. The<br>muscles and the liver both store energy supplies, in the form of glycogen.<br><br>This situation has developed simply because many people are looking for an easy way to lose weight that delivers quick results. No<br>such approach exists, yet the slimming industry continues to misguide people into believing that fast weight loss can be achieved with<br>minimum effort.<br><br>Achieving target weight requires lifestyle changes. These changes include regular exercise, a sensible approach to healthy eating and<br>the right mental attitude.<br><br>Why Dieting can make you FATTER<br><br>The conventional approach to dieting is a disaster. The first mistake is to call a program a Â“weight loss programÂ”. There are many<br>weight reduction programs, which if followed can produce rapid weight loss.<br><br>However, this weight loss is neither sustainable nor healthy as it involves dehydration and loss of muscle tissue.<br><br>When you are ill and bed bound similar results are produced in only 48 hours, especially if you have a complaint like food poisoning.<br>How much weight do you think is lost in the form of excess unhealthy adipose fat tissue?<br><br>DEHYDRATION<br>70% of the body is made up of water. It is easy to design a dehydration diet that results in losing 10 lb. of water within several<br>days. Many naive people are encouraged by these rapid results. Simply dehydration by 2-3 % of body weight can result in a<br>7% drop in physical performance.<br><br>LOSS OF MUSCLE TISSUE<br><br>If you lose weight too quickly, much of the weight loss will be muscle tissue. It is estimated that when people lose over 2lbs of weight<br>a week, 30-40% of the weight lost will be muscle.<br><br>This is a disaster for keeping the weight off in the long term because muscle is five times more active metabolically than fat tissue.<br><br>Exercise and Healthy Eating the First Priority<br><br>The aim of an exercise program is to lose fat without losing muscle and without reducing metabolic rate. The exercise needs to be<br>customized to fitness level and to specific goal of fat loss.<br><br>Together aerobic exercise and resistance training are the ideal combination of exercise to achieve fat loss and it should be part of your<br>lifestyle.<br><br>Aerobic Exercise<br><br>Aerobic exercise metabolizes calories and raises the metabolic rate. The heart rate needs to be raised to a comfortable level for 20 - 30<br>minutes at least 3 times per week. By exercising aerobically, calories will be burnt at a rate of 300 + per hour depending on your<br>weight and fitness level.<br><br>If you consider that just 1 pound of body fat has approx. 4,100 calories, then you can get a rough idea, of just how long it will take to<br>shed those extra pounds permanently. Look again at how long it took to put them on, normally years or a complete lifetime of your<br>own bodily abuse.<br><br>The debate of how hard to work: Personally I recommend that you work at a level that you know that you can maintain for a minimum of 20 to 30 minutes.<br><br>The debate comes in, when various fitness bodies suggest training at a high heart rate 75/90 % of max, for short periods or 55/80 % of<br>maximum heart rate for easier longer periods.<br><br>IÂ’m no scientist, but I have tried both methods on a number of clients, and have found like most things in life, it may work for one<br>person but not necessary for another.<br><br>In short try both methods, unless you are a complete beginner to fitness, in which case I would recommend training at a steady pace<br>for as long as comfortably possible.<br><br>Aerobic exercise will also raise the metabolic rate for approx. 24 hours after you have finished training. This helps to burn up extra<br>calories and prevents the metabolic rate declining.<br><br>Resistance (or weight) Training<br><br>Look in the section on this web site dealing with weight training for guidelines, or speak to a qualified trainer to aid you in both the<br>correct exercises and techniques for yourself.<br><br>Inactive people lose about 10 % of their muscle mass every 10 years after the age of 25. However with regular<br>resistance training it is possible to regain this muscle mass.<br><br>Resistance training should be carried out 2-3 times per week for approx. 30 minutes. Although not generally effective as aerobic<br>training for burning calories, resistance training will still burn about 250-500 calories per hour and will raise metabolic rate.<br><br>DonÂ’t feel that by doing weight training that you will develop a body that resembles a body builders, as these men and women spend a<br>great deal of their time as well as strict diets and grueling weight sessions to achieve the physiques that they have.<br><br>Another important point is that muscle will not turn into fat, if you stop training. The muscle tissue will naturally break down and<br>shrink in size.<br><br>Important point because lean muscle tissue weighs more than body fat, your actual body weight may stay the same, during the early<br>stages of your new lifestyle regime.<br><br>DonÂ’t be alarmed, the weight will come of, however if it does not, your overall ratio of body fat compared to lean muscle tissue, will<br>certainly be in a healthier ratio.<br><br>Try and avoid using the scales, unless they can monitor your body fat as well, instead measure your body at various points e.g. your<br>hips, chest, stomach and thighs. Using an item of clothing is also a good way to measure yourself, as with a bit of time and dedication,<br>you will find that the clothing fits you properly.<br><br>Healthy Eating<br><br>Good nutrition is very important for fat loss, and focusing on health and health promoting foods is far more productive than focusing<br>on fat loss and denial of favorite foods.<br><br>Adopting a whole food diet, avoiding salt, fat, sugar, additives, preservatives, processed and refined foods, needs to become part of a<br>life style change.<br><br>By increasing natural foods with a high fiber and water content (fruit and vegetables) more food can be eaten to appease the appetite<br>without gaining weight.<br><br>A whole food diet also has a much higher vitamin and mineral content than a typical diet containing processed and refined foods.<br>Dieting is such a negative term Â– I like to think of it as Â“eating to lose weight.Â”<br><br>The following charts compare the caloric value and expenditure values of different foods and activities respectively. It is important to<br>realize just how much work is required to burn off certain foods. For instance, to burn the amount of calories in a chocolate chip<br>cookie, it requires a person to walk vigorously for over 20 minutes. A cookie has a caloric value of 110 calories. A person must walk<br>for a 20 minute time period to burn off that one cookie.<br><br><strong>An excerpt from '6weeksrunningplan.pdf' found in www.stewsmith.com reproduced with the authour's permission.</strong></div>
