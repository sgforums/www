            <div class='col-md body'>Ok enough of talking about Jesus ! if Moca you want to talk about jesus please open another topic call "what wrong with calling jesus" I am sure Jesus will go there to drop you a line or two about not anyhow call him, he is too busy saving others in the world. Thank you.<br><br>What moca say about the wrong of SAR-21.<br>1) It is shorter, but heavier.<br>Not valid. There are version of SAR-21 that is light weight - got money got lighter ones .<br><img src="http://i86.photobucket.com/albums/k84/puzzylion2/mms.jpg"><br><img src="http://i9.photobucket.com/albums/a90/puzzylion/compactsar21.jpg"><br><br>2)It is more reliable, but many switches are in the wrong places.<br>How many switches on the SAR-21 ? Can someone please say !!! Wow one switch so difficult !!!<br><br>3) It is more compact for FIBUA, but mag change is slower.<br>Not valid . Already explain the changing of mag timing is not that significant, you are not doing western cowboy drawing of guns !!!<br><br>4) It has translucent mags, but you can't see the mag while shooting.<br>Not Valid. Kind of dumb if shooting you looking at target what how to see mag !!! Also all guns mag also have to turn a little to see see, what the different ?<br><br>5)It's got a scope, but the iron sights are crude.<br>Not valid . You shooting with scope what , iron sight is for backup .. if secondary - crude is ok , can shoot ok what, you want it beautify it is it .<br><br>6)Have they finally put a bayonet lug back on? Or do you use changkul when<br>SHTF?<br>Not valid. I see SAR-21 with bayonet, - maybe you are still using changkul for your own parade <img src="http://www.mindef.gov.sg/etc/medialib/imindef_media_library/photos/news_release/2006/jul.Par.0012.Image.gif?direct=1&lt;br%20/&gt;"><br><br>out of 6 you got 5 totally invalid .... so what is there to argue ?</div>

The cost of rebuilding them could've easily bought new weapons but British pride obviously frowned on that option.<br><br>Besides this example, we also got India's INSAS, which the Nepalese declared as crap even though they were given free.<br><br>The INSAS is the worst of the lot as it literally falls apart with all kinds of internal and external parts breaking.<br><br>QUOTE FROM INDIA TIMES: <a href="http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/articleshow/1245199981.cms" rel="nofollow">http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/articleshow/1245199981.cms</a><br>"major defects in assault rifles as well as light machine guns like change lever system, breakage of carrying handle, screw locking butt, crack of retainer and breakage of barrel bulge have come to the fore from forward areas," top army officials said."<br><br>Reading the whole article makes you want to weep.<br><br>And India is now in the process of replacing the INSAS with TAR-21 and AK-47.<br><br>Closer to home we have the Aussie and Malaysian-made Steyr AUGs with the usual reports of melting plastics and ejection failure etc. The Malaysians have decided upon a costly replacement with IMPORTED M-4s. I don't have the full report but they must be pretty bad for them to make such a decision.<br><br>The fate of the Aussie's Steyrs remains to be seen but universally - including the Kiwis whom were also supplied with this weapon - the feedbacks point to severe disatisfaction.<br><br>Even Dave C reports from the US that his Austrian-made Steyr AUG once had a cartrdge jammed or eat into the plastic or something.<br><br>Which should give us a lot of reasons to be proud of STK.

I don't have the full report but they must be pretty bad for them to make such a decision. </blockquote>Weird, cos I haven't heard much junk from the Aussies about their Styer... I mean until it started to be license manufactured there were no real issues about its reliability.<br><br>The Malaysian problems, as many have speculated... were due to their own inability to manufacture the weapons up to the proper standards.<br><br>AFAIK, the SAR-21s are nearly grunt-proof. Nearly because nothing is grunt-proof. They certainly can take more then your fair shair of bumps and knocks more then your M-16 without an issue- which is something considering it has a scope to take care of.<br><br>The only two SARs I heard of being seriously damaged by their grunts involved a friend's fellow Cadet who cooked his SAR accidently when he let it slip into a campfire while he was asleep, melting the butt and another grunt that apparently slammed his weapon hard enough to crack the scope.<br><br>On the other hand, my friend once threw his SAR in fustration after failing SOC, and the thing was fine.</div>
