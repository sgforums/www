I dare say we are third after Israel + USA and Israel + India. They do a lot of unreported tech transfers, which is both good and bad. I will not complain about that because it has benefits too.<br><br>India is a mountainous region, where are the special forces likely to be stationed? Kashmir and the Kush region, mainly dusty and cold temperate deserts/mountainous terrain. TAR-21 is much lighter and is proven in desert conditions during the Lebanon conflict.<br><br>Thirdly, India is a major power, but they don't really have a good track record in procurement policies.Sad to say, battle tested weapons will always get more sales than technically excellent weapons in countries that are in conflict or potentially getting into one.<br><br>Note that our weapon upgrades or weapon systems were sold to states that are not at war in their recent history or likely to be doing so in the future, e.g (Turkey : Yavuz/Terrex, UAE : SRAMS, Brazil : F-5 upgrades etc) with the exception of the Balkan conflict and the Croat use of the Ultimax.</div>

            </div>
            <div class='col-md body'>No debate, but obviously the M-16 can't fail like every couple of shots or it won't even be considered as an infantry weapon.<br><br>Fundamentally speaking however, the operating principle of the basic M-16 and co. renders it inherently less reliable then other system for it is a Â“dirtyÂ” system. A brand new rifle should work just fine but quite obviously more care must be taken to keep the rifle working in the field then say your typical piston firearm like the AK or the SAR.<br><br>So for the tropics where we see a lot of mud, water and soilÂ… we have always been aware of the fact that the M-16 system isnÂ’t entirely optimal for such an environment. Trouble is the system has very little tolerances to getting fouled, once it starts to show problem with the gas cycling itÂ’s time for a major cleaning or the rifle will start to get cranky.<br><br>So the piston for us at least, is a step forward in reliability. If your SAR gets fouled in the field, you still have the option of adjusting the gas regulator to restore functional reliability until you have the chance to do a proper cleaning. Which is quite a big plus if you are doing def. Ex in the mud and rain.<br><br></div>

Bullpups are rather dangerous for this to happen because the explosion usually happens right beside your head. So chamber explosions are an issue for bullpups not because they are inherently more unreliable, but because the same event carries a higher risk of injury or death.<br><br>In any case, from my personal experience and hearsay... chamber explosions were a rather talked-about topic in my time. We knew that they were rare but regular enough that it was an issue.<br><br>Depends on where you are as well, some units might just submit the report and hush it up... now where I was though.<br><br>Never personally came across an SAR chamber explosion, during my SISPEC an M203 did indeed blow up in the hands of this unlucky trainee. He was unhurt but the magazine was ruined (and had he put his hand there he would certainly be cut)... the weapon was a pretty badly damaged as well. I think the issue was with the rifle.<br><br>From what I gathered around as my experience as an instructor in BMTC, chamber explosions happen from time to time with our M-16s and AR-15s before they stepped up the FFF standards.<br><br>So what does this indicate? Depends on our NS experience... I mean there are several supposedly "common" NS events that I have never seen in my who experience... so only MINDEF has the numbers I guess.<br><br>As for SAR-21 chamber explosions... I think the only confirmed incident I came across was this NS man who drew a faulty weapon and fired it with the barrel rod stuck in the barrel... that would have exploded any weapon and had it been an Aug or SA80 he would almost certianly been badly injured or killed.<br><br>But thanks to the K-plate, he escaped with only superfical burns.<br><br>There were other incidents which were filtered down to us as notices and hearsay, they are highly similar involving firing the weapon with a part missing (hence the bolt could not lock and the gases escaped in a direct blowback) or with stuff in the barrel that should not be there. In all those cases the weapons were already not fit for firing, nor would any other make of weapon, given the same situtation, have escaped a chamber explosion.<br><br>So is the SAR-21 really more prone to chamber explosions? Or has the SAF decided to become more transparent with its incidents. We can only speculate, but I think the latter is far more likely.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Yes, my personal experience with the reliability of the SAR had it firing thousands of rounds per day during the NDP carnival without giving us issues with IA. What's more we didn't have time to properly clean the weapon before it had to be used again the next day, at the end the SARs were running for one whole week without proper cleaning on dirty blanks and we didn't have any major problems with the rifles fouling at all.<br><br>So it certainly deserves it's reputation for reliability. It's a weapon combining the best traits of the M-16 and the AK-47 into one modest package.</div>
