            <div class='col-md body'>i think it's the israel brand that was the deciding factor. somemore the tar-21 purchase is meant for their special forces, so perhaps they want something that's developed by the battle-rugged israelis than ST and also something that's lighter? aiya ST can produce the 5.56mm ammunition for this Indian deal not bad liao lor <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Yes, that's my second theory - that Israel is a more important strategic partner than Singapore. That's why they bought TAR-21.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>The third theory is that they feel that it is a loss of face to buy arms from a small country.<br><br>Call me over-sensitive.<br><br>But I sometimes feel that this is a really potential problem every time we fail to secure a major arms sales to a big country. Forget about Timor, Croatia etc.<br><br>Why can't we sell the Ultimax, Bionix, CIS 50, 40mm AGL etc to major armies? Most of us here will testify that these are pretty neat pieces of gear.<br><br>Yes, the 155 howitzers seemed to be doing best with licence production in Pakistan.<br><br>It must be our size and our lack of clout, then?<br><br>There are some people in the Philippines army who really liked the Ultimax but eventually, the major order went to - you guessed it - the overweight and over-priced Minimi.<br><br>It weighs and costs much more than the Ultimax but fires the same 5.56mm bullet. So the cash-strapped Philippines army ended up with less weapons than they could've gotten for the same money if they had went for the Ultimax.<br><br>WHY?</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Seriously.. from range videos..<br><br>I am not impress at all with the TAR-21... the recoil dislodge the shooters shot line up with every single shot. The TAR maybe be shorter and lighter, but that means shot barrel. The internal parts is also (in my opinion) seemed fragile. You practically needs a iron pick and a hammer to strip it. The coil spring could be remove from the butt-stock though.<br><br>The TAR-21 doesn't seemed to have much review at length in extended operations.. it's just too new. And Israel does have a strong worldwide media control to promote it. There is simply not much negative aspect to judge the rifle.. maybe it's that good.. but that also make my suspicious.</div>

I have experienced the joys of FIBUA with such a weapon...<br><br>However it is a nice quirk, but I think different designers have different ideas for the balance of their weapon.<br><br>The TAR-21 is back-balanced (from my experience with it), with the weight shifted to the rear to prevent muzzle drop while going prone or other difficult options... and also because it's more natural in the human wrist to keep a barrel down then trying to pull it up. One handed operation is also possible with the Tavor- BUT the back balance does not help in soaking the recoil and makes it worse in some cases... seemed to be one of the reasons why the Israelis who converted to it were critical at first (and not just because they were experiencing the switchover syndrome like us), but they adapted to it pretty well.<br><br>Oddly enough, still don't see this firearm in widespread Israeli use.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote>the charging handle, its just as awkward to use as the G36 charging handle</blockquote>What's so awkward about it? I found its egronomics superior then the charging system of the M-16... can be operated by either hand and does not require you to move your hand to an unnaturally rearward position to charge the weapon.<br><br><blockquote>the kevlar plate ...wtf? its good logically but i could do without that extra weight. </blockquote>As for Kevlar plate... it's Singaporean kiasuness... but a chamber explosion with a bullpup is no joke. As opposed to failures in a conventional layout where you might at worst be injured, a bullpup failure might kill you or take a large part of your face off. Seem the aftermath of an Aug explosion before? You do not want to be using the weapon at that time.<br><br>So yeah... that in mind, I don't mind the insurance. There might be nothing wrong with the weapon but if you get a batch of faulty ammo you are screwed. The kevlar plate has already saved several lives in SAR-21 chamber explosion incidents in the SAF so at least that's one feature we have that was tested by fire. So yeah, I'm for it.<br><br>In fact it should really come standard with any bullpup design.<br><br><blockquote>Firing selector is at the BACK of the rifle, not really good for tactical situations.</blockquote>How so? Are there any pressing tatical situtations that require a switch from semi to auto on the fly? I find it hard to think of any... often its either a case of you're already semi or already auto. Of course one also needs to consider that building a forward fire selector is a tricky prospect in bullpups that involves adding linkages. So no duff to ST if they wanted to avoid it entirely.<br><br>How long does it take to switch to auto anyway? Not even a second.<br><br>It would be a problem if the safety switch was behind, but that's not the case.<br><br><blockquote>Maybe its cheaper but spec-ops ARE willing to pay for a lighter,better and more expensive weapon.<br><br>And if im an Spec-op , i will too choose the Tar-21 solely for its reputation and no brainer fire selection position.Proven in battle , why not?</blockquote>The SAR-21 is designed in the lines of the AK47 and M16, in the context of a rifle that was intended for mainsteam use in the conscript Singaporean army, so it's not exactly surprising that it does not fit the spec ops bill the best... not any more then a stock AK47 or M16 fits your spec ops operator. There's a reason why it's called <span style="font-style: italic;">special</span> operations, after all... lol.<br><br>Not the normal variant at least. The SAR MMS or LW variants make more sense for spec ops use. But hey, if you are spec ops, why not spend?</div>
