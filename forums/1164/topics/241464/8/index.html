            <div class='col-md body'>30 rounds mags will not be the de facto std during war time. They know that. The drums will be shipped from stockpile when the time comes since they are factory loaded.<br><br>But imagine this... if you were a M249 gunner &amp; u ran out of belt ammo. Stranded in the field. No resupply train or even if they come, limited stock &amp; variety, no belt ammo only 30 rd mags or worse, loose rounds. Ur version of the M249 does not have the magazine adapter (to save cost, complexity and weight), say the paratrooper version of it. U'd be stuck with a 15 lb piece of metallic deadweight.<br><br>With the U100, u can thumbload the drums with loose rounds to half-capacity or till your thumb hurts, whichever comes first.<br><br>Or u can always pick up any 30 rd mag from the field or borrow from ur buddies no problemo. U can even conserve the drums by using 30 rd mags for non-critical light covering fire...<br><br>We got the right gear &amp; can be thankful for that...<br><br>A few thoughts:<br><br>1) Is the U100 able to take the SAR-21 polymer mags as is?<br><br>2) On a side note, I've been thinking of starting a new thread on whether the USMC will adopt the Ultimax 100...</div>

I remeber my NS time when some mags are M16 and some have the 2 holes for the SAW ! SO technically in war time unless all mags have the SAW conversion mags!  the regular M16mags will not work!  But ! 2nd probelm, SIngapore has gone to the SAR21 ! and the mags will not fit the U100! So! this issue is not relavent anymore!<br><br>The Mk.4 would have solve this problem but.. it is still using the Beta C mag which has so much reliability issue in Iraq !

            <div class='col-md body'>Dave, not that I want to re-invent the wheel by re-visiting the history of how the Minimi was adopted as M249 and all that but people lose sight of the history and context of things.<br><br>The fact remains that it replaced the M60, which was more like a GPMG by today's standards, 7.62mm, weight, size &amp; all. Not to slight the M249 but its easy to see why it was considered a major improvement over its predecessor - as a SAW.<br><br>But then again, the M60 itself as a replacement for the venerable Browning BAR was such a huge step backwards for the concept of the SAW anyway, the bar was therefore set very low. It was a compromise of a solution to be everything - aircraft, heli, tank, vehicle, fire-base, boat/ship mounting Â– but it was an awful SAW...<br><br>An observation of what is a political point must surely be made - it is a no-brainer that most of the countries adopted the M249 either because they were NATO (for standardization &amp; cross-operability purposes), or regarded the US as the reference point to save costs, or merely lacked real conflict experience to do any better. In times of uncertainty, adopting the same Â“SAWÂ” as the US was an iron rice-bowl management decision - uÂ’re less likely to see your head roll if the procurement decision proves to be a dud (Â“the US adopted it whatÂ…Â”).<br><br>Problems with the M249 as an inappropriate SAW (perhaps better for everything else) first surfaced during Desert Storm, which coincided with its implementation (in fact it was rushed straight from manufacturing to bolster the limited numbers in service) but it was a conflict too brief to do more than flag up the problems. As the USÂ’ first major engagement since WWII in desert conditions, the red flags were buried under all the other issues, such as Apache/heli rotor blades wear out, jet engine turbine failures, vehicle air filter clogs among a million other problems. Probably due to political reasons as well, it was swept under the rag as it would have been too unpalatable to condemn a newly fielded weapon as a flawed SAW platform.<br><br>However, it is this current prolonged conflict in Iraq/Afghanistan 10 odd years later that has raised such pressing concerns that the USMC deemed it necessary to issue a call for new specifications. Call it the IAR or what you will, itÂ’s a necessarily political move to justify to Congress yet more additional expenditure for yet another non-standard SAW/LMG by &amp; for yet another branch of the US armed services. The USMC proved up to its reputation as being no bullshit indeed by saying what needed to be said, with analysts almost unanimously agreeing it was testament to the problems with the M249.<br><br>I dun think we need to gloat like the SAF made the perfect decision (is there ever one?), but it was certainly very brave and a GOOD decision to actually create something that turned SAW design on its head. A good design stands the test of time, it was revolutionary, not evolutionary like the M249. Its vindicated by the fact that its born about the same time but has proven to be more relevant than everÂ… even rated far better as a SAW by analysts in these times. Perhaps it was by default thrust upon the SAF given the limitations of physique and our basic infantry unitÂ’s squad size, whatever.<br><br>When I made my first post, it reflected my beef on this thread with all the juvenile &amp; irrational bleating about why anything is superior to the U100, like belt-feeding, 200 rounds, even the look of the M249 Â– when it is plainly NOT the case. Even the C-Mag, which was bandied about like some Mattel must-have Christmas wishlist toy by so many, including you - I simply had to mention the reliability problems and ridiculous (to me at least) graphite lubing needed. And contrary to your earlier post, its reliability issues are so wide, it extends to hand loading to full capacity too.<br><br>Your clear fascination with the M249, belt-feed systems and/or C-Mags reflects this Hollywood-ish fetish with lots of rounds for Rambo like auto bursts, not withstanding the current major rethink about the M249 amidst all the issues it presented like reliability, complexity, cost, weight etc. which I raised in my first long post.<br><br>My point about the statistics is that if the current Â“most widely adoptedÂ” belt-feeding SAW in the Western/allied world is the subject of the top complaints by US troops, it goes to show that the M249 and belt-feeding CANNOT be better than what we have, the U100, which has even proven to out-hit it. What you repeatedly champion as being superior when you tried it as a gun nut is wholly different from lugging it under combat conditions.<br></div>

            </div>
            <div class='col-md body'>On a side note:<br><br>Recognise also one other thingÂ… dual belt/mag feeding on the M249 isnÂ’t just an issue based on whether the variant has the magazine port. By reliability issues, IÂ’m referring to issues like the M16 magÂ’s spring not being strong enough to feed the M249 - one reason being its very high rate of fire. ThatÂ’s what I meant by the cost/complexity/weight issueÂ… itÂ’s a feature which is at best unreliable and at worst a penalty better done without.<br><br>At least this much is clear, dual feeding has never been very practical nor perfect for any weapons platform. At least with the U100 &amp; M16, there was the talk in the SAF of adding the 2 holes to all M16 mags, an incredibly cheap measure, though IÂ’m not sure whether since my time, its been completed. My understanding is that a large number has been so modified. Again, as I mentioned before, the SAF has a huge stockpile of brand new ammo &amp; mags all over the island for any war, including secret underground sites dug into our Bt Timah granite hill areas. The training stuff that unfortunately we all use is NOT the real deal.<br><br>Some others on military nuts have speculated on the mag compatibility issue post-SAR21. So will there be a change to the SAR-21 LMG (nah!), modification of the U100 to take the same polymer mags or simply retention of the status quo? If the latter, at least thereÂ’s a huge quantity of M16 mags available for the status quo Â– CHEAP!<br><br>Whicheverway, its kinda obvious that magazine feeding and even ammo design is in flux. U canÂ’t replace a 40 year old gun w/o spending some $$$ on magazine streamlining! I remember my time when we had to use rubber bands to secure the M16 mags on M16s as insurance against big time detention in barracks. Anything would be an improvement.<br><br>Its not just a situation unique to the SAF with the recent adoption of the SAR 21.<br><br>The U100 Mk 4 xxx if adopted by the USMC could point the way to future feed strategy - U100 drum, M16 Stanag, XM-8/SAR 21 clear polymer or some new std. No country has any idea where the solution.<br></div>

Graphite lube is a proven form of DRY lubricant, its not wet. Its used in industrial machinery too. Its carbon powder based and slides because of the molecular structure of the carbon being in sheet/layer form.<br><br>In the case of the C-Mag, its because its so difficult to open up to maintain (requiring tools and a clean environment) that the manufacturers provide it to pre-empt users from applying normal oil based lubricants. Oil attracts dirt &amp; dust, compounding the reliability problems. In temperature extremes, it also causes the polymer/plastic parts to break down over time.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I am what people call a lurker, Just read and rarely(If ever post in this forum)<br><br>LET, your understanding of SAW U100/Minimi impress me.<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">As a Junior Member, sorry for been so blunt.</span>  This Thread is For SAR-21.  there are some issues with the fellow and it's being resolved.<br><br>SG combat concept for SAW differs from that of Other Countries (Very Normal)<br><br>U100 is mean for Assault Operation, be it 100 rd Mag/30 rd  Mag. Both serve the Purpose very well.   Nice, Narrow and light weight, the length can be reduce, but reducing the barrel lenght, range is affected.  Look at the Butt, some modifications can be done.<br><br><strong>Explanation, </strong><br>Dependent on Unit SOP (Infantry and Armour Unit differs on this also):<br>A typical "Text Book" single contact, takes the SAW about 160-200 rds are used, either 2 100 rds Mag or 1 100 rds, and the rest 30 rds Mag.   With the "Fresh" clip inserted before the final assault.<br><br>Minimi, if a problem is encounter with that Ammo Box(200 rds), it take slight longer to replace as compared with U100 100/30 rds system.  <span style="font-style: italic;">Minimi 30 rd Mag replacement timing is similar with U100 system.</span><br><br><strong>Belt Feeded Problems</strong><br>1. <strong>Weight</strong><br>Minimi, there are 200, 100 and the 30 rd version. Some will argue that the 200 rds is enough ammo for a single contact.  This I would agree, but the price/penalty is the weight of the whole weapon (As what Let had mentioned).<br><br>2. <strong>Cleaniness of Ammo</strong><br>Mag cover the Ammo, with less leakage as compare with belt system.<br><br>Minimi is a fine weapon when used in a Defensive Operation.  Long Belt of Ammo can be linked up to provide protection capability, without the need to replace the ammo box.<br><br>In a Defensive position, <span style="font-style: italic;">(I play alot of this as Aggressor Simulator)</span> In a Well kept Gun, rarely need to open up the weapon to reload, shot till tens of rds left, shift the next box over, link up, and continue to cause "Misery".<br><br>No need to worry about Dirt/Sand fouling up the Link and Jamming the weapon.<br><br>More rds can be put thro a Minimi, than a U100, partly due to the extra barrel supplied, and the Gas system.<br><br>In an Assault situation, I prefer to use a Mag system, as the ammo can be kept cleaner, and less chance of fouling.<br><br>3. <strong>Aiming</strong><br>In an Unsupported Position, U100 wins this area Hands down.<br><br>In a Tripod position Minimi is Far Superior Accuracy, no U100 Tripod is issued at the current ORBAT.<br><br><strong>Little Secret</strong><br>In some unnamed countries (X and the Union Jack Fellow)  GPMG ready to use ammo for Infantry, are kept either in a special Box Mag or , a cloth sleeve.  just to keep the Ammo clean and prevent jamming.<br><br><strong>Agree with Let</strong><br>U100 serve SAF purpose better.  Minimi is nice to have, if it can be easier on the weight department.<br><br>Keep This Thread is For SAR-21.   Thanx</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>With regards to the U100's 30/100 round mags issue...i suppose it boils down to this. Not sure if others have mentioned it but...SG is largely urban. If sh*t hits the fan, be sure to see our boys chionging up HDB,Condos, Commercial Bldgs. The drum is a good choice,when doing suppressive or coastal deployments when you have waves of baddies rushing you and all you need to do is lean back on the trigger and the enemies keeps on dying. But for the 30 rounders,its more streamlined, lighter then the drum and as such, for rushing into a HDB unit with 3/4 guys behind or ahead of me, ensures that I'm able to keep pace doesn't it? And you don't go Rambo, but you have a buddy with u in FIBUA/CQB. So even though you zap your rounds through very quickly, and have to duck to reload will be there to make up for the firepower.</div>
