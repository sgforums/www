They loved the scope though hah. </blockquote>I think your info a bit outdated leh... the first production run of the SAR for main SAF use HAD the backup iron sights (actually most scoped weapons have a backup sight of some sort). It seems the modifications made in response to the feedback was to make them stockier and more durable.<br><br>I'll say it before and I'll say it again, these backup sights work very well, and in fact they are easier to use then the M-16 iron sights (though probably not as precise)! They are good at 100m, and still usable at 200m... though you might as well use the scope at that range.<br><br><blockquote>Actually I think its quite true, from my experience with air rifles in school to rifles and pistol in the army, I have never seen anyone go from a wowo to a marksman, those who struggle will always struggle. Heard from friends who are in Sar21 units that they still have wowo shooters despite having a scope.</blockquote>Well from my experience training soldiers to use both the SAR and M-16, you will still get wowo shooters in both weapons. There will just be some shooters who no matter how much you coach them or teach them or give them as many aids... are simply unable to use any kind of a firearm. For some reason they just can't do it.<br><br>HOWEVER it is clear that the wowo rates are certianly much less then the M-16, mainly due to the simpler handling egronomics of the SAR, and the scope as well, which takes out a lot of the sight picture work that you get with the M-16 iron sights, which some soldiers just don't get.<br><br>Inability to use iron sights accounts for quite a bit of WOWO shooters and the SAR-21 converts this batch into proper shooters.</div>

I'll just give my two cents worth from my experience in coaching the greenhorns to shoot.<br><br>Shooting is not a skill that comes naturally to everybody, however it is possible to train somebody to become a good shooter. I believe most people fall into this group. The make of the firearm as well as the features can make this job easier or tougher.<br><br>However, there are indeed some people that no expense of effort can transform them into reliable shooters. For some reason they just can't seem to grasp the fundementals... and certainly not quickly enough in the timeframe we usually have in the two to three months of BMT (not all of which is spent on BTP) to transform them into good shooters.<br><br>The SAR-21 certainly cuts down on the number of non-combat effective shooters by turning marginal shooters into competent ones. Usually these are the ones who for some reason can't figure out how to get a proper sight picture with iron sights. So that improvement for the SAF is certainly quite material.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Not sure what some people mean by at 300m the M-16 gets off the first shot.<br><br>From my personal experience, there is no big difference in the amount of time it takes to aquire your targets.<br><br>Depends on your skill on the different sighting systems as well... some people not used to the scope might take longer to aquire a target with it then with iron sights. Conversion distress could be a big factor behind it... especially if it was a previous M-16 shooter converting to the SAR.<br><br>But of course, all things considered... getting your bead on a target with a 1.5x scope is a lot faster then iron sights, once you get used to it. Combat zeroing is also much more simplified.</div>

After that it will sell like hot cakes and Moca will then call it a good rifle because people buying it like AR - all because of changing a few words - yes folks, "the Pen is mightier than the sword" !</div>

For some reason they just can't do it.<br><br>HOWEVER it is clear that the wowo rates are certianly much less then the M-16, mainly due to the simpler handling egronomics of the SAR, and the scope as well, which takes out a lot of the sight picture work that you get with the M-16 iron sights, which some soldiers just don't get.<br><br>Inability to use iron sights accounts for quite a bit of WOWO shooters and the SAR-21 converts this batch into proper shooters.</div></blockquote>Not production models <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"> more like the 1st series produced for testing<br>hahha my news was like 2001 man</div>
