            <div class='col-md body'>Pity about the Yanks not being able to crack their next gen rifle puzzle though, but they really let out all the dogs to achieve their aims. But I suppose the relevant technologies had simply not matured enough for their to achieve their goals.<br><br><blockquote>Much of the cost and weight savings, not all of which have actually been achieved in the current prototypes, are from the weapon's electronic sight. The sight is much more than a 1.5x red dot scope, including IR lasers and pointers as well.<br><br>The baseline XM8 carbine (with its integrated sight), for example, can be compared to a M4 carbine with a host of previous-generation electronic add-ons like the AN/PEQ-2, M68 CCO, ACOG, and/or BUIS. <strong>Without the advantage of the next-generation combined electronics sight, the XM8 would be both heavier and more expensive than the firearms it is intended to replace.</strong> The XM320 grenade launcher intended to be used with the current M4/M16 firearms as well as the XM8 family, <strong>is heavier than the M203</strong>, but does include feature enhancements.</blockquote>But seesh, it was a cool gun.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Whoops, I didn't catch your post. Nope, I wasn't refering to you expressing surprise, just that that nobody should find it really surprising.<br><br><blockquote>I was pointing out that while the Americans are aiming for a 30% decrease in weapon weight over the M16/M4, the SAR-21 actually went the opposite way and resulted in a (30%?) weight increase over the M16/M4. </blockquote>Noted, but I think the reason as to why it's quite obvious in itself:<br><br>The SAR was designed under different circumstances, not mention more modest requirements to create a replacement to the M-16 more in step with its time while the whole American ACR project is a far more ambitious thing more akin to creating a totally new generation of small arms (one type, all guns) and getting the whole concept working to begin with.<br><br><blockquote>Is the XM-8 is officially dead, or just put on hold?</blockquote>It's has been dead for over a year now (as of 31st Oct 2005), after having being put on hold for a while. I think they tried putting the weapon up for other things but so far they have been unsucessful.</div>
