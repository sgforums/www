            <div class='col-md body'>Truth is, if you are in a firefight and need to reload, you ought to have found good enough cover that gives you more then enough time to do the action and more. I think far more people are killed by IAing weapons or not being able to shoot well then being unable to reload quickly enough. Lets not even talk, about the Yankie M249 gunners who have to mess with a belt system!And they are using such a thing on the squad level!<br><br>It's really your tatics in battle that determine all this rather then how many miliseconds you can shave off doing certian actions- granted these actions must be done in a reasonable time frame but beyond that it hardly makes sense to nitpick unless your tatics somehow rely heavily on reloading as quickly as possible... but I really can't think of any.<br><br>In terms of time taken, it is obvious you can never reload a bullpup as quickly as a conventional system. But the difference is really marginal and certainly not enough to put any competent soldier's life in danger... a reason why most of the latest rifle designs have been bullpups. Personally the magazine system of the SAR is a great leap forward in reliability over the older metal mags, polymer mags are the way to go man and they should really come up with a standard for it for all nations to use.<br><br>If you really don't want to worry about reload issues, try a C-Mag instead.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>True ... but a further redesign of the MP5 for 10mm and 0.40S&amp;W calibres have dropped the right side mag release button leaving only the paddle style mag release lever ... what would this indicate?<br><br>The design of the MP5 trigger group and magazine release (indirectly inherited from the CETME/G3)  resulted in the right side mag release button being somewhat further from the pistol grip than what a typical m16 user would be accustomed to.  What this means is that in actual use, quite a fair bit of users are unable to operate the mag release button without removing their trigger hand from the pistol grip.  The primary method of magazine release still remains the lever, with the button as a secondary backup. YMMV.<br><br>The original design decision in the MP5 for 2 methods of magazine release was more for redundancy than any particular ergonomic advantage of the M-16 style release button.  Moreover, this redundant design feature, found in the CETME/G3/MP5, is of the same design era as the M16 and most certainly predates the popular era of the M16, which IMO precludes any influence by the M16 design on the CETME/G3/MP5.  When H&amp;K redesigned the MP5 to accept 10mm and 0.40S&amp;W calibres, they dropped the redundancy to simplify manufacturing, retained the release lever and indirectly acknowledging the poor implementation of the mag release button.<br><br>Don't believe me?

Take a look at all the FNs, HKs, AKs and what have you out there ... they all use the thumb release catch.  In fact for most CT troops where speed is everything, the weapon of choice is the MP5, which also uses the thumb release instead of the m-16 style finger release ... surely that must mean something?<br><br>On an aside, one of the advantage of a thumb release catch is that it is truly ambidextrous, which means simplified weapons training as the drill is the same for both LH and RH firers.

            <div class='col-md body'>Not that I want to nitpick, but here's my take on what it brings to the grunt and takes away from the previous M-16.<br><br><blockquote>It is shorter, but heavier.</blockquote>Accounting for the extra features of scope and LAD, yes. But then again isn't that a moot point considering decking out a '16 with the same features brings things back to square one? Unless of course you intend to use expensive MARS sights.<br><br>Of course, the better balance of the SAR is also a big plus. And having fired both systems full auto before, the SAR is a lot more stable.<br><br><blockquote>It is more reliable, but many switches are in the wrong places.</blockquote>Seems to me the only real switch that we have reason to cry foul about is the place of the fire selector. The rest of the controls are where they should be, and the charging system is a big plus over rear-placed the M-16 system.<br><br>But I think a lot of it is due to which system you are more used it. Save for the position of the fire selector, I found the overall ergonomics between both systems reasonable and it's really a matter of how well you are drilled in your firearm.<br><br><blockquote>It is more compact for FIBUA, but mag change is slower.</blockquote>Ditto for all bullpups, however the time difference is not significant enough to affect your drills.<br><br><blockquote>It has translucent mags, but you can't see the mag while shooting.</blockquote>Don't really think translucent mags are really meant to be viewed while shooting or taking aim. So I'm not sure what you really mean. It provides an easy means for a grunt to check his ammo status without having to play the guessing game with the old mags.<br><br>Plus the new mags are a ton more reliable then the metal ones, they don't warp or dent and takes a lot of worries off loading a faulty mag and getting a misfeed. Polymer mags are the way to go man.<br><br><blockquote>It's got a scope, but the iron sights are crude.</blockquote>Ney, I tested them many times before. They are SPOT ON out to 100, still working up to 200, and beyond that you are better off using the scope anyway (actually you ought to use the scope as and when you can).<br><br>If I recall some of the early SAR marks actually had a fully functioning set of iron sights... but it was determined that this added redundancy was better adressed with a far simpler, and more reliable set of open pistol-style iron sights. And the sights work... though putting green dots to allow night shooting through them would be great.<br><br><blockquote>Have they finally put a bayonet lug back on? Or do you use changkul when SHTF?</blockquote>Un uh... the shorter length of bullpups make them far less useful for bayonet fighting. I mean while it's totally possible to mount a bayonet on a bullpup... it actually being useful is another matter entirely. There are a lot of things you can do in close combat (which you should avoid)  then just bayonet fighting. But I guess the old grunts might beg to differ... though I was of the transition batch that learnt more of the other techniques to make up for the phasing out of bayonet fighting.<br><br>Normal rifle CC methods still work...</div>
