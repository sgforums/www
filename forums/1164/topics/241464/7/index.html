            <div class='col-md body'>Not sure about belt fed though... that method also has its own issues- namely in the area of reloading time and the jangling sound a half-empty box of ammo belt makes at night if you are not careful. Getting your ammo into a disposable belt is also another pain for the section level weapon.<br><br>Hence, it seems that a lot of emergent proposed LMG designs turn to the magazine system for the answer, so I wonder if going belts is a step forward.<br><br>Heh, but it seems we're still waiting for the holy grail of magazine technology- the reliable high cap mag.<br><br>But come to think of it spring loaded drum mags have been around for a very long time... it is odd that we didn't think to come up with one that works and works well.<br><br>As to why the drum mag was withdrawn, one of my PCs in SISPEC was one of the people present to witness the actual moment that made that choice (some of them disagreeded with the change but lacked the rank to pull), apparently the main issue was not reliability but the inability to handload the drum to full capacity once the factory load had been expended... so some wise guy though it was lighter and more compact (though not egronomically wiser) to simply carry 3 mags of thirty then one drum which you could at most handload up to 50 when it should be taking 100.</div>

HOWEVER it does seem that in the current design thinking is leaning towards trying for the drum mags, especially when you get those SAW variants of the ARs.<br><br>Mags have several obvious advantages over belts when it comes to the section level firearm. Mags are reusable, present less of a logistical footprint then belts (due to the links), and prehaps more importantly can share ammo between all the grunts when it needs to be spread out.<br><br>Reload times... well I don't think it's a big issue. BUT one must remember we use the U100 a tad differently then how other armies use their SAWs, given we often employ it in the mobile assault role as opposed to its use as a static support automatic weapon, so a decrease in reload time might be useful from a mag based weapon.<br><br>But yeah, they really need to figure a good solution for the drum mag, as opposed to us relying on the 30 round mags for the SAW.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>good drum system needs lots of redesign on the drum mags! Maybe a newer iteration of the Beta Cmag would solve the reliability issues</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>The U100 Mk 4 uses the M16 type mag weld and thus could use the Beta C Mag! the C mag although can be loaded with hand and a small tool! is still not the perfect solution to the Drum issue!<br><br>Hopfully the designer from ST is not rellying on the Beta as their solution to the feeding drum problems!<br><br>I would like to see the U100 to be fielded correctly!  and I Do like the U100! I would love to buy one here in the US but they are not really available as a CLass 3 weapon here! So! pretty much we are SOL.  I've got a few M4 including one in piston running a few Beta mags!  they worked great until you bring these mags to the Desert in AZ! We had one machine gun shoot there and we get multiple jams on the beta C mags...<br><br>Agreebale with you all that Mags would be much more compact , less cumbersome! but unless they can improve on the reliability! I take somthing that is reliable 1st over anything! Reason also I went to a Piston M4 or SIG 550 series or FAL over the M16 system.<br><br>DaveC[/img]</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Please, unless you really know the facts, let's not make wild conjecture about the reliability &amp; safety. It is reliable &amp; certainly safe. The Croatians loved it during the Serbian war. There are no confirmed reports otherwise in all the 20 years.<br><br>The reason the U100 drum magazine is not widely used in the SG army is the difficulty with hand loading to the max (100 rounds) cost due to the strength of the spring. That &amp; the cost.<br><br>For training purposes, the need to reload regularly and the cost of sending it back for machine reloading makes it costly for peacetime use. Believe me, they have stockpiles of it ... when it comes to war time ... it'll be issued pronto.<br><br>Its the same case with all large capacity magazines since time immemorial. The Thompson sub-machinegun during WWII was the same. The mobsters (clean urban setting, dodgy money, macho scare factor) used the drum but ironically not the troops during WWII. Even then its not even anywhere near 100 rounds.<br><br>The cost is also an issue with all modern "large" capacity magazines. Look at the price of the P90 mag.<br><br>Some misconceptions I noted:<br><br>1) C-Mags<br>They are not the answer. If only because they need graphite lubricants in order to hand load!<br><br>Its tough enough to expect soldiers to clean/oil their rifles during combat. To expect them to lubricate their magazine is ridiculous to me. I'd rather be maintaining the rifle.<br><br>Incidentally, the American designer commissioned by Singapore to invent the beloved Ultimax 100 is also the inventor of the C-Mag. The original version was all black, nylon plastic. No lubrication needed. But the current C-mag makers put in a clear Lexan back to enable viewing of the remaining rounds. Penalty - the lubricant. If u dun use it, it'll jam too.<br><br>Of course, the cost of each mag again. The U100 drum is simpler.<br><br>2) Belt-feeding<br>I dun know why so many ppl yearn for belt-feeding. Be careful about the devil you ask for.<br><br>Read the US troops current top complaints. The M249 is one of them. The Iraq experience has shown that its slower to reload, mechanism is more complex &amp; prone to reliability problems especially when encountering sand/mud, cleaning/oiling/maintenance is a pain as a result, the gun needs to divert more gas to provide the energy to "pull" the belt through the system, which means that theoretically, given the same barrel length, less propellant goes towards pushing the projectile = less projectile energy/accuracy/range etc., the ammo on a per round basis is heavier &amp; more costly due to the metal links.<br><br>I guess the grass is always greener on the other side. If you use the 100 rd drum everyday, you will not be even wishing for belt ammo.<br><br>That forms the basis why the USMC is evaluating the LMG concept for which the U100 is the only EXISTING product that fits ALL its requirements without modification.<br><br>As to the perceived disadvantages, they are a non-issue:<br><br>1) Why do you need 200 rounds, when you know that the U100 is the most accurate LMG/SAW in the world? Our boys representing the SG army in the Aussie combat skills competitions ALWAYS top score against all the US/Aussie/NZ/Brit or whatever countries taking part - all using the FN M249.<br><br>The whole point is to concentrate the bursts into tight groupings. Make every round count. Use short accurate bursts. The U100 outhits the M249 ALL THE TIME.<br><br>Only Hollywood likes unlimited rounds. Real soldiers have to bloody lug them around.<br><br>The U100 means less weight penalty not only gun wise but ammo wise. The strain on the logistics chain is more manageable too.<br><br>2) The U100 weighs 10lbs as opposed to the 15 lbs of the M249.<br><br>I DON'T EVER WANT US TO BE USING THE M249. If u've ever done your road marches or jungle exercises, u'd be crazy to want to struggle with a weapon 50% heavier or with 200 round ammo boxes or worse... noisy clinky ammo belts!<br><br>Same barrel length &amp; overall gun length. But the U100 is infinitely more usable with a folding stock too.<br><br>3) The U100 can use the 30 rd mags wheras the M249 needs another complex /costly/heavy adapter.<br><br>4) Speed of loading / self-sufficiency.<br><br>Besides the oft mentioned doctrines of the SAW gunner as integral to the assault maneuvers, the SG army is quite unique with its 7 man squad. Population constraint, what to do? Yet still must maximise firepower right?<br><br>The SAW gunner has to be self-sufficient and able to reload as quickly as any other soldier using the 30 rd mag.<br><br>With the M249, you'd need another soldier for support, if not for quicker loading, then to carry the bloody ammo! Which the gunner tends to waste because he is far less accurate and tends to squeeze off using longer bursts!<br><br>See the vicious cycle?<br><br>5) Ability to handload - moot point<br>For goodness sakes, how the hell do you intend to hand link individual bullets from M16/M4s into belt form while in the field? Using glue? Sewing kit?<br><br>What has been bandied about is the issue of small mechanical loaders to "lever" the ammo reload in the field though, that could be the answer.</div>
