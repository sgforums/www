            <div class='col-md body'>Well for one, i guess is the ability to have dual feed.  The CIS 0.5 can use two differnt types of 0.5 ammunition whereas the browning can only have one.  The other IMHO is weight.  There are some other differences but i'll leave that to the others.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>If the admin finds that I disclosed sensitive information, please edit or delete my reply.<br><br>I have personally handled both weapons during the NSF and reservist day......<br><br>Handled the Browning 0.5" during NSF day, the weapon was a beast to carry, just the body is closed to 18kg!!! Imagine carrying that yourself to the M113 which is 1 km away....(old SOA and vehicle shed)..............'93<br><br>To prep the weapon is also troublesome, head space and timing "Go, No Go, Go, No Go" must be done else the weapon cannot fire and may even encounter chamber explode if handle improperly. Everytime you change the barrel, you must redo the head space and timing.........depending on your proficiency, can take 5 mins to 10 mins......must be done by 2 persons. 1 do the head space timing, the other insert the barrel and turn the barrel.......<br><br>Bloody lot of parts to clean and if not careful, will cut yourself or lose somet parts........ also RUST easily!!!!!!!<br><br>Was trained on the ST HMG during 1st ICT.....Ultra conversion in '97<br><br>The weapon is lighter, can be carry by a person. No need to do head space and timing. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br>Switching of barrel is a breeze. Pull back charging handle slightly, press barrel release catch and pull out the barrel. vice versa for putting back the barrel.<br><br>Cleaning/maintence, stripping and assembly is also a breeze.......... less parts to handle....... placed on the fixed pinter of the Ultra cupola, the weapon is BLOODY accurate!!!!! See the round hitting the oil drums continously...sibeh shiok!!!!!<br><br>As to 2 ammo belt feed, I dont remember seeing that.......in Ultra........<br><br>On the cupola, 2 ammo chute, 1 for the 0.5" HMG and the other for AGL....maybe dual feed ammo are for other uses.......airforce or navy...??<br><br>For the old 0.5, there are many types of ammo, ball round, AP, API etc etc.....differeiated by the coloured rings on the projectiles....<br>During L/F in Singapore, we fired only ball round. In Oz, we fired API and our battlion burnt off half of our L/F area ('93)  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz"><br><br>As I remember during the conversion, this new 0.5 only has one type of ammo. That is the SLAP round........shaped like tank's SABOT round.......never fired this round before but our instructors said that this rounds can easily destroy soft skin targets, sand bunker and concrete bunker. This ammo are only issue during op.....LF only fires normal ball rounds. You can also use this ammo to stab a person to death........is desperate........... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz"><br><br>For all potential VC/PC/PS, please remember now you have great firepower(2x40/50, 1xOWS and two tanks), you can now destroy enemy by fire follow by a mounted assaults to clean up enemy. Please dont anyhow dismount troops and asked them to flank 3-4 klicks to clear enemys!!!!!<br>Unless exercise play........<br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br><br>[quote]Originally posted by storywolf:<br>[b]<br><br>Well basically no one did much in upgrading the 0.5 much.

            <div class='col-md body'>Well, if u wanna cut someone in half with rapid firing rate with a .50cal, then I got nothing to say.  If enuff bullets hit a person no matter armor piercing or not... also will die.<br><br>But I believe, rather than zuah a person with 30over  .50cal rounds, a short burst from a 7.62 would do the job.<br><br>Btw, this is not my theory.  This was told to me by a 1st Warrant from Armor.   Personally, I rather not be on the recieving end to test it.<br><br>However, let me give u an example.  In mogadishu, the US Rangers engaged the "skinnys" with carbide tipped 5.56 rounds, a tougher round for piercing body armor.  They often see their targets get hit, but stand up to run away, and it took several more hits to knock them down for good.<br><br>Simply cos the round was hard, and did not fragment upon impact with flesh, and had the velocity to fly right thru, leaving little tissue damage.   And thats from the  muzzle velocity of an M-16 only.<br><br>Imagine the muzzle velocity for the HMG, and the toughness of the SLAP round which is meant to penetrate LIGHT armored vehicles.  How much tissue damage u think it can cause?<br><br>It is not a theory.<br><br>Some of the photos u've seen of people getting blasted by .50cal rounds, are probably fired from a Light fifty sniper rifle.  THAT causes extensive tissue damage cos those rifles use different rounds.   Those rounds have a softer core compared to the tungsten sabot of a SLAP round.   I think just the impact will cause severe internal bleeding alr...</div>
