I was trying to make the point that there are fighters "ready" to intercept at any moment's notice.  In some cases, jets sit with their engines running and INS fully aligned, just waiting for a pilot and clearance to taxi.<br><br>As for powering up the A/C, you'd still need to wait for the INS to align, unless you want to try running that alignment off the EPU.

Shut down the jet, and let it keep its INS alignment using the Stored Heading.<br><br>Still need abit of time to align after start up though.  But its a hell lot shorter.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Well frankly, im surprised that they allow a plane to continue flying without a flightplan or comms. They will have detected the plane on civilian radar even if their military ones were scanning at that moment.<br><br>Cessna bigger or MKM bigger for RCS? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">  Well i feel better at least.<br><br>It's obvious that they didnt comms the plane cause if they did, we would have been able to  contact the cessna and have no need to scramble. The cessna's radio was not functioning.  I'm very impressed by what they said based on assumption.<br><br>By the way, now i know WHY we are so going for stealth. HEHEHEHE. It's a small plane and completely "harmless".  It's a small fishing boat, and completely harmless too!!!!</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Any idea why it was diverted to Changi instead of say Seletar?  I mean what if it was loaded with explosives and this fellow pretended to comply &amp; at the last minute does a nose dive and KABOOM!!!  Massive explosion in the middle of Changi would ruin whatever investor confidence we had.</div>
