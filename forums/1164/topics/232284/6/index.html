            <div class='col-md body'>How much do you personaly know about Thaksin and how much does a Thai Know about PM Lee? Only from your point of view that you feel Thaksin is well loved and most respected in Thailand well everyone has a right to an opinion especially in a chat forum but dont make comparison between the King of Thailand and Thaksin,they are two people in  total different leagues.Like compairing CSJ with LKY.The topic is Singapore may lose Thai training camp.If that really happens then I will be here to criticise the Junta to the fullest but like I said earlier this has nothing to do with the King.Even a good father cant solve most problems in a family.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>The problem with the current Thai Junta is that it fails to differentiate law and wishful thinking. On one hand they want to stop Thaksin from going to the press and what not, but they must realise that there is absolutely nothing they can do about it. By de jure, anyone in the Singaporean Govt can meet him on unofficial capacity and any one can go talk and do business with him so long as it is not pertaining to the business of Govt and treat Thaksin like he is a Prime Minister in Exile, though he is technically, a PM in Exile.<br><br>That said, Thai Juntas traditionally like to have liberal interpretations of law, which is why you can have bloody riots like those a decade or so ago. That's the problem with military types. They interpret law like they can write it as what they want. Happens in the SAF, happens everywhere.</div>

The airspace is purely Thailand's sovereignty, which cannot be traded for any private interest whatsoever. Thug-Sin inked the deal in return just for his business interests with the Lee's.....without consent from the Thai public. The Thais have not benefited from such deal at all as you guys think. Worse it helps complicate the violence in the south. Thailand has been dragged into quagmire of being a Non-NATO ally because of one selfish man, Thug-Sin.</span></div></blockquote>You sir, like most idiots baying for Thaksin's blood, fail to conceive the notion of rule of law. The rule of law must be respected and if the law is found to be flawed, it should then be reformed by parliament or the equivalent body. The rule of law cannot be changed by mere mob-rule, especially when the mob in question hardly presents a significant slice of society. Mob rule implies that the rule of law is not respected and any one can do what they so like. It sets precedent and will have no doubt have many repercussions in the future. This is why Thailand has so many coups. The Rule of Law is not respected, and idiots think the gun rules all of it. The King should not have agreed to this coup, and the King most of all should have forced everyone to the negotiating table instead of authorizing the extreme use of force. The whole mess Thailand is in now, is because idiots like you favour mob rule over rule of law.<br><br>Unfortunately for idiots like you, Shin Corp is not a Thai Govt asset, nor were there provisions to halt its sale. So like it or not, and stuff this fact down your stupid throat whether it is burning acid or not, the sale was legal, and unless some obscure provision in the law was dug up, or the Junta decide to take the law into their own hands, typical of military types, the sale will go through.<br><br>And oh, by the way, airspace is Thailand's sovereignty, perhaps you could start by stopping all airlines except Thai airways from stopping in your territory. Technically, that's violating it too.</div>
