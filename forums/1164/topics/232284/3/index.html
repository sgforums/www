Hell, Beijing will always be pissed (with Taiwan) if the 5 stars is not flown over the Presidential Palace in Taiwan!<br><br><blockquote><strong>Haha, I would do that if you could share what Singapore has to gain from siding with Thaksin.

Look the authorities here may have thought that by informing Bangkok of Thaksin's visit beforehand and when nothin was heard from Bangkok, we may have deemed the visit is ok.  BUT, the lack of reply (from Bangkok) could be due to Bangkok's indecision on how to respond ('Yes' or 'no' to such a visit), so when the visit took place (amid Bangkok's decision), Bangkok was 'lost' and cry foul which may have shocked Sing (remember 'silence' = 'consent' or 'no opposition to such a visit'?).  Therefore, Bangkok's reaction was not expected, therefore the issue of 'how' and 'should' Sing distanced Thaksin' was not arised' here I believed.<br><br>My take from you here is different.  You were upset on why Sing allowed Thaksin in in the 1st place.  My take is , remember the upheavels that were happening against Thaksin when he was premier?  And somehow, Temasek Holdings even made the decision to buy into Shin Corp at the same time even when the commercial terms are favourable.  I was shocked that how come no one in Temasek Holdings did not see such a acquisition will be hugely controversial and unacceptable in Thailand esp during the calls that Thaksin is using his premiership to abuse power, generating policies that is favourable to his family biz etc.  Mind you, one do not need a crystal ball to look into the future and no expert to tell TH that things are not going well for Thaksin during that time.<br><br>It is akin to you don't need an expert to tell you that major powers is not in favour of NK having a nuclear bomb and yet you signed a commercial agreement exporting uranium to that country!  duh!

From my observations, the king is old already and no longer has the energy or back bone to do the things he want.<br><br>So, when the general wants the coup, he only can say he will support.<br><br>From me, it is just not possible for the King to dispose Thaksin as he has many many many many supporters from the North.

            <div class='col-md body'>Well, lets put things this way<br><br>a) Singapore and Thailand are both sovereign states, yes no?<br>b) Thaksin has a passport<br>c) The current Thai authorities did not have an arrest warrant over his head nor suspend his national passport, they only took away his diplomatic passport.<br>d) As a free Thai citizen Thaksin has the freedom to travel anywhere<br>e) I believe the MFA did notify the relevant Thai authorities<br><br>Sorry for reiterating various points but putting it together hopefully can get a clearer picture. Singapore like Thailand and the rest of ASEAN states value our independence as a nation, if Thaksin chooses to visit Singapore on a private visit as a free individual we have no reason to reject his entry. As for accusations of insensitivity, didn't we notify the Thai authorities beforehand of his intentions to meet the DPM? If we were to back down on this, what sort of signal is it sending to the other countries? That Singapore can be bullied into compromising issues of our sovereignty like who we allow to enter into our country? Especially when the person in question is legally (though not morally perhaps) a free man? The issue with Thaksin is one of Thai domestic politics and do not involve our diplomatic relations and nor should we implicate the King. Its a matter of the men in charge simply over reacting especially when the credibility of the coup is being questioned the longer the probes drag on without much of a result<br><br>Losing the basing rights is of course of regret if Thailand so chooses, and if that occurs we will have to accept that as their right. However it will do no good to any side to continue in such a manner and we should all just move on</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>A few comments from a newcomer.<br><br>1) Is it possible for someone in official position to present himself as a private citizen for his activities? For example can the Japanese PM visit the Yasukuni Shrine as a private citizen while holding the office? If yes, then the Chinese and Koreans have no ground to condemn any Japanese PM from visiting their shrine as a private citizen. If no, then the Chinese had grounds when they protested against LHL private visit to Taiwan. Similarly, the Thais have ground to be unhappy for a 'dissident' to visit our DPM privately.<br><br>2) Can we stop someone holding a legal passport and not formally restricted by his country in anyway to be interviewed by a foreign press legally stationed in Singapore? No, if there is no legal grounds. Unless subversive (against Singapore) speech was given, then there is again nothing wrong.<br><br>3) The Singapore government's is to provide and protect the best of interests to Singapore. There are no eternal friends, only everlasting benefits. We may never know if Thaksin will ever become a PM again since he has a strong support base in the north and he still wants to be a member of the TRT party.<br><br>4) The Singaporean officials should have already calculated and weighted the benefits and fallouts of this particular event before hand. I would say, as per SOP since this is not the first time and will not be the last. LHL's private visit to Taiwan created some issues. I would say, everything is within 'tolerance' and control.<br><br>5) The current Thai king is only next to Budhha in the heart of the Thais. No one can survive in the kingdom if he speaks ill of the royal family, especially the king.  He exerts crucial influence in politics through his privy counsellors who are mostly former PMs and top military commanders. He has done many things for his people, if not they would not have revered him so much. He is a strong supporter of democracy and constitution monarchy. He just wants what he thinks are good for his people, and being more wealthy without is not necessary a good thing.</div>
