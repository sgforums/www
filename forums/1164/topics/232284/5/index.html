They are not a freely elected govt, that came into power via a coup. As far as it is known so far, they are an illegitimate govt in power.  If they really want to keep their face, they should their best not to draw to much attention to that FACT by starting all this ruckus about ShinCorp and Thaksin's bak kut teh trip.<br><br>And it is not as if Sg has not given any face.  We've given the Thai King face by the fact that we are maintaining normal relations.  If the Thai King really has Thailand's best interest at heart, he'd start tugging on the leashes of those military dictators before they really do something that wrecks bilateral relations.<br><br>Finally, as a sovereign nation, Singapore does not have any 'Uncles.' Every nation and state are equals in the international community and should treat each other with respect.  The question Singaporeans are asking is not, "Why they can, and we cannot."<br><br>The question is, "Do you not respect OUR sovereignty?" The military govt should try to refrain from making such "threats" that they cannot act upon.  It would only serve to deplete the dwindling credibility that they have in light of their illegitimacy.</div>

Brader!!<br>Military People tend to use a different tone of language when blood rushes to the brain the choice of words may not sound right but the message is still the same.Here we have a decorated General with all that fruit salad on his chest running a Country,I am sure you too are familar with a General running a country and surely you dont expect a General to be made like a clown now do you?The King is a figure head like a President in SIngapore or something like that......He is not a politician and has to be impartial for self preservation despite being also a father figure and the most revered person in Mueng Thai (land of the free).Even a King or a President can be ousted and I believe you know that too.The uncle &amp; nephew thing was just a metaphor.There is a functioning Embassy in Orchard Rd and that clearly means that this Junta like the one in Myanmar is a recognized Goverment.Unlike Myanmar the Thai people will have their chance to elect and choose their leaders in the near future.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Here's something posted by Billybong. I think Mr georgie should be sacked!!! That guy is FM not to maintain good relationships, but making enemies siah.<br><br><blockquote><br>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>Thai FM warned S'pore over meeting Thaksin<br>Foreign minister Nitya Pibulsonggram says he informed S'pore counterpart George Yeo at Cebu summit that planned meeting with DPM Jayakumar was unacceptable<br><br>The Nation<br>Jan 20, 2007<br><br>Thai Foreign Minister Nitya Pibulsonggram said yesterday that he had personally warned his Singaporean counterpart George Yeo that there would be "reactions" from Thailand if former prime minister Thaksin Shinawatra was received by Singapore's Deputy Prime Minister S Jayakumar during his visit to Singapore last week.<br><br>Mr Nitya said that after having been informed of Mr Thaksin's pending visit to Singapore, the Thai Foreign Ministry notified Singapore "at least three times" that the treatment to be accorded Thaksin was "unacceptable"; to the Thai Government.<br><br>Speaking to a group of senior editors during their lunch meeting with Prime Minister General Sura-yud Chulanont at Baan Phitsanu-loke, Mr Nitya said his warning to Minister George Yeo during the Asean summit meeting in Cebu, the Philip-pines, had been unmistakable.<br><br>"I told him: 'We cannot accept the fact that Thaksin is going to be received by Singapore's deputy prime minister'," Nitya said. "I emphasised that it was something unacceptable." The Thai foreign minister said he also warned Yeo "there would be reactions" from Thailand if Mr Jayakumar received Thaksin.<br><br>Mr Nitya was apparently trying to counter media reports that the Foreign Ministry had not been forceful enough in impressing on the Singaporeans how serious the consequences of such meeting would be.<br><br>Despite Thailand's protest, the Singaporean government went ahead and arranged a meeting between Mr Thaksin and Mr Jayakumar which subsequently prompted the Thai Foreign Ministry to retaliate by suspending all high-level meetings with Singapore, including a ministerial dialogue scheduled later this month. The invitation to the Singaporean foreign minister to attend the dialogue was also withdrawn.<br><br>Mr Nitya said that while other countries were sensitive to the Thai Government's stand on Thaksin, Singapore had made itself an exception.<br><br>"It was a slap in the face to Thailand and tantamount to recognising the former government," said the Thai FM.<br><br>He added that that during his conversation with Mr Yeo, he had also reminded his Singaporean counterpart of President SR Nathan's recent pledge to General Surayud that Singapore would not do anything to "betray" the trust and understanding between the two countries.<br><br>"I looked Yeo in the eyes and reminded him that he had been there when President Nathan said that," Mr Nitya said.<br><br>Asked how the two countries would repair the damage from the row, Mr Nitya said the Foreign Ministry would assess the situation "on a daily basis" before deciding what to do next.<br><br>"But if you are asking me if I am going to fly to Singapore tomorrow, the answer is no," he added.<br><br>An informed source close to Surayud said that during their meeting in Cebu Chinese Foreign Minister Li Zhaoxing had told the Thai leader that China was very uneasy about Mr Thaksin's presence and activities in Beijing, where he spent most of his time after London following his ouster from power in the Sept 19 coup.<br><br>Mr Li also assured Gen Surayud and Mr Nitya that Beijing would not allow the former Thai leader to engage in any activities that would displease the Thai government.<br><br>"Li also assured Surayud and Nitya that no Chinese official had met Thaksin during his stay in China," said the source.<br><br>The source said the Chinese understood the situation very well.<br><br>"When Khun Nitya tried to explain at length to Li what Thaksin shouldn't be allowed to do while in China, the Chinese foreign minister even helped him to get straight to the point, asking him: 'So you want him to do nothing damaging to his own country, is that right'?" the source said.<br><br>Meanwhile, Gen Surayud said that former prime minister Thaksin was welcome to return to Thailand but only when the "terms" had been worked out. "He can return, but first we have to talk about certain conditions," he said, without elaborating.<br><br>The General earlier said that Mr Thaksin should only return to Thailand after a new government came to power following a general election.<br><br>He also insisted that the Thai Foreign Ministry's decision to suspend all high-level contacts with Singapore in retaliation for Thaksin's recent visit to the island state during which he met Mr Jayakumar was appropriate and necessary "to let Singapore know how Thai people feel".<br><br>But when asked for comment on the claim by General Sonthi Boonyaratglin, chairman of the Council for National Security, that Singapore had been eavesdropping on Thailand's communication channels, Surayud said it was only a "technical matter".<br><br>"If you ask them, they will of course deny it," he said.<br><br>On Thaksin's ongoing tour of the region and media interviews, the prime minister said his government had no objection as long as he was not accorded recognition by host governments the way he had been in Singapore.<br><br>In a related development, Singaporean Ambassador to Thailand Peter Chan met Interior Minister Aree Wongsearaya but played down the meeting as "a normal courtesy call".<br><br>"Mr Chan said Singapore would continue to work with Thailand to strengthen their longstanding good relations and looked forward to an improvement in relations," said a statement from the Singaporean Embassy in Bangkok.<br><br>Meanwhile, Mr Thaksin arrived in Japan late on Thursday on a private jet from Beijing. He is expected to continue with his attack on the government in Bangkok and reportedly will meet business leaders.<br><br>Mr Thaksin played down the trip, telling waiting reporters there was no pressing reason for his visit.<br><br>"Now is a time for me to relax, get together with my family and see my old friends,'' Thaksin was quoted by the Associated Press as saying upon arrival at Narita International Airport outside Tokyo.<br><br>Japanese officials reportedly said they were aware of Mr Thaksin's visit but had no plans to meet the former leader.<br><br>Tokyo University spokeswoman Kayoko Hayashi dismissed media reports that Thaksin was planning to deliver a speech at the university and receive an honorary degree.<br>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br></blockquote>Unfortunately, our govt apparently decided that it was a 'trivial' matter and permitted it to go ahead despite the warning signs.<br><br><blockquote><br>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>S'pore FM George Yeo confirms Thai warning over Thaksin's visit<br>But he assured his Thai counterpart that the former premier's meeting with DPM Jayakumar was "completely social and private".<br><br>AsiaOne<br>Jan 20, 2007<br><br>Singapore's Foreign Minister George Yeo, who is currently in Calcutta, has confirmed that Thai Foreign Minister Nitya Pibulsonggram spoke to him "two to three times" in Cebu about former Thai Prime Minister's visit to Singapore.<br><br>A spokesman for the Foreign Minister, responding to the Mr Nitya's comments reported in The Nation today, said: "Foreign Minister George Yeo said that he had the highest respect for Foreign Minister Nitya Pibulsonggram.<br><br>"Minister Yeo said that while he understood the Thai Government's concern, he also sought Minister Nitya's understanding of the Singapore Government's position.<br><br>"Minister Yeo assured Minister Nitya that Dr Thaksin would have no official meeting in Singapore and that his meeting with Deputy Prime Minister S. Jayakumar would be completely social and private."<br><br>Mr Thaksin, who has been living in exile since the coup, said in an interview on CNN this morning that he came to Singapore to play golf and meet old friends.<br>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br></blockquote></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>For the Past 40 years Thailand always have problem with their Government Body .<br>The Thai Public servant  always had a problem with corruption . Those with huge power will always be the one who get more , So now do you guys get a picture when someone like Taksin is being thrown down , it's not very difficult  to say someone with high greed not to be attracted to his post .<br>I have stay in Thailand for sometime however I just don't understand since the King is so good but why he can't stop the real corruption and how the Country is being manage since he is a fatherly figure and all Thais love him . So I do have a conclusion , it's the will and wall of greed which come within the Family and relative . The King is working all his life for his people and for sure some just don't feel that they get enough .<br>The general who overthrow Taksin is in trouble before the coup took place , he was actually will be replace by Taksin because of his inability with the South-Thailand work , the intention is clear " I'm not stepping down , I rather stay and I'll make myself the Top Man so that no one touches me " This explain When the coup took place it can only engage a coup and not the plan for rebuilding a Temp. Government . This Man again with his greed sadden many people like us .<br>Taksin may not be a  Good man but what he did for the Thais is much bigger than  What's he is wrong , look at our relationship with the Thais now , they are blaming Singapore for having a good meals with his old friends , if Taksin is still in charge will this thing happen ? This thais Government look down on Singapore , they say that we are not even near thread and by saying so don't you think that is it already offended our Relation . This man is born with a head but no brain  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_twisted.gif" alt="Twisted Evil" title="Twisted Evil"> . Taksin is Born better <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"> .<br>The King is still a Good man and the Prince will like his Country to be in charge by Someone like Taksin . Things are showing that the Thais want Taksin Back soon , that explain y many TV Station still take chances for his news .<br>Before Taksin was remove the main problem of Thailand , illegal Gambling and Yaba(Drugs) was being control but right now the problem is back to it same old days . The present Thai Gov. ban the Gov. operated 4D gambling and this open the doors for the illegal one and of cause others follow , for example cock fighting is back three time a week in thailand before you can hardly see them as darling as now . Drugs is back when Gambling is back as everything seem losen day by day .<br><br>Just sharing.<br><br>I got more to write about but will wait for more information................<br><br>Regards</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Very interesting alternative views and good points raised. Im not putting down the king, but its true as the country's leader why cant he solve the problem as all leaders are expected to? Is he under the control of the military? We wont know, but it does smell of it.<br><br>Also Thaksin's contributions to the Great Kingdom of Thailand certainly outweighs the cons, he severly clamped down on drugs although a bit brutally and it was for the better good for the people. Quote Kingdom of Heaven "Sometimes you would wish doing a bit of evil for a greater good (along the lines)" Not advocating violence but it was better for the people right? The manner in which it had be done could be better, agreed.<br><br>During the recession where Thaksin rose to power, he transformed the thai economy. Made progress and THAT is good.<br><br>I dont know about the General Sonthi getting sacked or relieved but if that is to be proven true, then the people who staged the coup are no different from what they call thaksin to be... corrupt.<br><br>Anyway I really dont think the Singapore government is that dumb to ignore warnings from the Thai FM. If it was purely private, there is nothing wrong. But yes the responsibility is on their shoulders to make sure their actions do not send out the wrong message. Perhaps they made a boo boo, perhaps they made a good decision. We as civilians really won't know if there is some kind of funny deal going on.<br><br>I think in terms of PRing, Singapore is doing a better job in showing its image as a friend. We still give courses to thai people despite the Thai illegitimate govt cancelling a meeting and proposing to chase the SAF out of Sai Yok and  accusing Singapore of conducting spying activities and reverting to walkie talkies.<br>Its quite childish im sorry to say.<br><br>Its a big question mark as to why other nations dont get s.h.it from the Thai govt when thaksin visits their ministers only Singapore. Until today they never justified that.<br><br>Right now the winner is really mr thaksin.<br><br>Cant wait for the current thai govt to collapse. May there be a fair elected government and hope the King will set things right.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Interesting new view points there.<br><br>No offense to Thai Royalty. However, it appears that Thaksin has done more for Thailand than the King did.  In some areas, perhaps Thaksin enjoyed greater popularity than the King. Perhaps the King felt somewhat threatened by Thaksin's popularity and approved the coup by the military. There was significant friction between Thaksin and the military elites, which saw some rather surprising change in commands.<br><br>I doubt that Thaksin, though popular, had any plans of ousting the monarch.  The Thais revered the King and it would have been unwise to try to cause dissension towards the him. However, the Generals may have been the ones who harped on Thaksin's popularity to the King to support the coup.<br><br>If there is anything this entire episode shows, is that the military should never been part of politics and be allowed to influence the country's politics.  In this case, the Generals were influential enough to overthrow a democratically elected Prime Minister.  Its really scary for a democracy for that to happen.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>He is very much under the influence with the economical direction of Singapore . Since day one he is wanted to be in politic , he want to change Thailand Direction . He make his business better just to back up his vision for the Thais , when his power in Thailand got stronger, his enemy become more , just look at all the one who betray him after he left the Country , they don't even dare to let him go back to his own Country . He make the worse mistake by selling his empire business to Singapore , this make him weak , this is the point of time that changes his life . Taksin vision is to make Thailand into a better Country and actually it's a true fact that it's becoming stronger , he as a strong man will sure be very reluctant to let the Thais to go back to the Country it was before , but when his mind was determinated he was blinded as well , he never though that the King can't be his friend . He take his chances but to him I think it's just a choice , a choice not to let others to come in to mess up his Vision for the Thais and I think he will never go to sleep without thanking this well earn lesson . " If today I lose my Power , The Thais will lose my vision and when someone with no better vision than mine then my Country will not be strong and people will suffer "<br>He is some how like the King himself surround by those who love him but doing the wrong thing behind him . Do you think he got a choice , do you think if the King got a choice , both this man need those trusted man but deep inside trusted man not necssary to have a trusted heart , you can depend on them but depending to them is what money can buy and most money can buy .<br><br>As usual just sharing<br><br>Regards <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_redface.gif" alt="Embarassed" title="Embarassed"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>For those who mentioned that Thaksin has played a bigger role for creating what Thailand is today, I urge you to think again. The King of Thailand has little direct power under the constitution but is a symbol of national identity and unity.<br><br>King Bhumibol Â— who has been on the throne since 1946 Â— commands enormous popular respect and moral authority, which he has used on occasion to resolve political crises that have threatened national stability.<br><br>He also mentioned he will not get actively involved in politics unless it comes to a point whereby the people of Thailand are deeply divided. There is a right time for every action and he chooses his next move carefully. He doesn't wish to be seen as a King who decides each and everything...<br><br><blockquote><br>Although Bhumibol is a constitutional monarch, he has several times made decisive interventions in Thai politics, including the political crisis of 2005-2006. Bhumibol has been widely credited with facilitating Thailand's transition to democracy in the 1990s, although in earlier periods of his reign he supported military regimes. Most recently, he did not oppose the September 2006 coup which overthrew the elected government of Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra.<br><br>Bhumibol uses his great wealth to fund numerous development projects, particularly in rural areas. He is immensely popular in Thailand, and is revered as a semi-divine figure by many Thais. Critics, mostly outside Thailand, attribute this status to the suppression of criticism of the monarchy. </blockquote><blockquote><br>During the 1970's, Bhumibol was a key figure in the Village Scouts and Red Gaur. In October 1973 after massive protests and the deaths of a large number of pro-democracy demonstrators led by students, Bhumibol asserted himself politically for the first time by opening the gates of the Chitralada Palace to fleeing students, and holding audiences with their leaders.</blockquote><blockquote><br>In 1992, Bhumibol played a key role in Thailand's transition to a democratic system. A coup on February 23, 1991 put Thailand back under military dictatorship. After a general election, held in 1992, the majority parties invited General Suchinda Kraprayoon, a leader of the coup group, to be the Prime Minister. This caused much dissent, and the conflict escalated to demonstrations and then to a large number of deaths when the military was brought in to control the protesters. The situation became increasingly critical as neither side would back down and the violence escalated.<br>Bhumibol summoned Suchinda and the leader of the pro-democracy movement, Major General Chamlong Srimuang, to a televised audience. At the height of the crisis, the sight of both men appearing together on their knees (in accordance with royal protocol) made a strong impression on the nation, and led to Suchinda's resignation soon afterwards. It was one of the few public occasions where Bhumibol directly intervened in a political conflict. A general election was held shortly afterward leading to a civilian government.</blockquote></div>
