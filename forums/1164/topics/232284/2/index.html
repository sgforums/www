We are only using existing air bases there.

The Thai foreign ministry have been notified of this current visit by our Singapore ambassador to Thailand,a few days before it actually occur.

Just like you, all of us will side with our host country.  If you think I'm emotional here, nope I'm not.  I'm just shocked with the latest development.  Withdrawing the invitation to the Sing FM &amp; the civil service meet-up, I can understand this but to up the retaliation scales by threatening to cancel a contract for Singapore to use a military training...that's a different matter.  Sorry, to say this, but such behaviour is akin to someone threatening to turn-off our water supply when things don't turn out well.<br><br>We definitely appreciate Thailand for allowing the SAF to train on Thai soil, but to use threats like that?

Sure, like u said, bangla workers go down to orchard road to "grab ass" during festive seasons.......thai workers don't. But do u know, when thai workers gather under a tree or along the grass patch, they will have bottles of beer n bits to chew on. Once they leave, they will leave behind all them beer bottles and trash. They don't bother to pick em up and put em in the trash bin. So we have the bangla "ass grabbin" and the thai leaving trash and beer bottles around. Both are equally the same. But I would take PRC workers anytime. Know why? Cause their government told them to behave and be model PRC workers when in other country. I have worked with Thai, Bangla and PRC workers. The ones that really worked their heart out are the PRC anytime  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz"></div>

Dumb examples if you ask me. If you wish to quote examples, you should suggest that Singapore forgo relationships with China just to forge greater friendship with Taiwan. That would be a great example of creating frosty political relationship for the sake of it. Wasn't our PM's visit a simple visit too?</div>
