We lost two sets during SAFINCOS, spent next 4 weekends combing the training area for them (somehow traineees dropped them during excercise). Found one 'worn' by a tortise (I kid you not), somehow it must have snagged the equipment and dragged it along for a bit before we found it. If so, say "hi" to her and send her on her way please.<br><br>BTW in Burnei - we had cicadas as big as mess tin (captured by hand then injected with meth spirit), they looked like a huge fly (bug eyes and double wings) and has a nasty habit of flying inside the bunks!! Outside we did not say much except huge spiders, giant ants (~3cm length) etc. Even say fresh water prawns in streams.</div></blockquote>Must excuse my recollection of the topography of the reservoir. Also the perspective of a recruit ,maybe 6 weeks into BMT, is different from a seasoned soldier. The river crossing was done in 1983 !!! Since 1984, I did not return to that damned island. Almost did on one occasion before ROD , as my company was slated to do some training there... but somehow I was attached out in same period, to do enemy simulation for Starlight.<br><br>What size was this tortoise? If it was large enough, Mindef could have a replacement for a independently mobile armoured vehicle simulator equipped with MILES !!!</div>

Anyway Tekong reservoir is too small and too shallow for any large wildlife. BTW the temple is still 10 minutes walk away from the crossing point (you must have got muddled up with the last rest point before the crossing site).<br><br></div></blockquote>That you are totally wrong. It is totally possible, croc been know to cross kilometer, even through jungle to find small water hole. If you track from mac ritchie to bt timah , you will see sign of croc warning in the middle which is away from water. This is because croc been spot in the middle of jungle.<br><br>A reservior may be view as small, but it can be fill with fishes. Also there be wild animals like wild boar to drink from it. One wild boar ate will let it go month without food.  Also it can be a small croc, about 1.5m so don't need that much food, a fish or 2 for a week will do.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Still more cool stories coming in... Thanks for the responses.<br><br>I must stress that I have not said much about the domesticated animals that NS men will keep at the Company line. We have had our share of puppies, kittens, snakes and golden arowana (yes, the famous "kim leng" !!!) back in the 1980s.<br><br>The arowana (about 12 inches long) was kept in a 3 foot fish tank in my platoon office.  It was brought in by one of the sect cmdrs whose businessman dad did not want it anymore. The OC did not like it on the grounds that the air pump consumed electricity and therefore the Singapore taxpayers' funds !!! Anyway, we were 19/ 20 year olds who did not pay tax and did not understand him at that time.<br><br>Some evenings, the duty section commander and I will conduct a "gecko parade". What this entails is that a nominated section (who is free from night training) will comb the company line for house lizards that are at least 2 inches long. All lizards will be caught and kept in jam bottles. Needless to say the lizards were rationed out to the arowana. On lizard -dry days, the parade will be a "stand-by cockroach" night !!!<br><br></div>
