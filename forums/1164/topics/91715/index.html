            <div class='col-md body'>Hi there,<br><br>Just wondering if anyone has seen and encountered rare animals in their training experience in Singapore (particularly). I guess I am asking an unusual question which is different from the usual "Has anyone seen or heard a ghost in NS?" question.<br><br>To start off with, I will relate my personal experience during NS....<br><br>This happened around 1984 (yes, long time ago). Was taking my BMT recruit platoon to the 100 m range near Mandai reservoir. It was late afternoon (5 p.m. or so), range was almost over and a bunch of us were standing next to the safety Land Rover parked at one side of the range next to a woodcutter's trail leading into the forest. We were "talking cock" and clowning around as usual.<br><br>As the sun was low in the horizon, it cast a nice warm glow and sunshine along the trail. I was enjoying the moment when I saw what I thot was a dog -like animal on the trail about 80 m away. But it did not move like a dog and in fact seemed to be grazing along the trail ... picking at the grass and plants. I moved about 10- 15m closer, and this animal looked up ... sensed that I was drawing near. At that moment, I saw its body shape more clearly and realised that in fact it was a Mousedeer ! A rare thing, previously thot extinct in S'pore, as our ancester hunted it for its meat.<br><br>After a few seconds, it decided that I was too close and trotted off into the belukar.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Plenty.<br><br>Seeing a wild boar during my Tekong BMT was a 1st for me, having grew up in the "urban" Jalan Besar/Beach Road area. Stumbling upon a super-sized spider was also balls-stinging then; no idea what type it was but it was as big as a frisbee, very reddish but not hairy so it couldn't have been an oversized tarantula.<br><br>Taiwan is full of stray dogs; I even "kidnapped" a mongrel to bring back to Meiling camp (from where it ran confusingly around the base for days). Anyway, I saw a 5-legged canine during my 2nd Hsing Kuang ICT. Also came across a shredded snakeskin in the bushes there; its size suggested it must've been very long, but wasn't a python. That's Arty recce for ya.<br><br>One thing that's always bothered me is that I saw no birds when I was attached to 6 SIR during their jungle-training in Brunei. Dead snakes (roadkill), living scorpions, jungle chickens, fishes in streams - all yes, but absolutely no birds for 5 weeks for some reason.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>There was i time where i went to the reclaimed land in Tekong for recce ex i am walking in tall grass then suddenly come to a open clearing in the tall grass with many trails leading to it. At first i don't think too much of it but then i suddenly remember what my BMT PC told me that this is a wild boar nest! This means that there is a female around with piglets,the females will be very defensive with piglets around and may charge. I quicky got out of the place.<br>The second time i saw a wild boar is the real thing,the male is huge like a baby rhino and definitely not look like a fat domesticated farm pig . It is leading its family and walk past us during our briefing... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hi Baer,<br><br>Your theory about the Hissing animal being a wild cat of some sort could be right. All I know is that I sensed that it was not a small animal and it was sort of bracing for a fight as it was surprised by me leaning on the tree. I am not kidding when the sense I felt was so strong that I had to draw my bayonet in anticipation of an attack by this animal !!!<br><br>Anyway... here is a second hand story, which has no collaboration. A regular NCO told me that he encountered a giant land tortoise in Seletar Reservoir forest area in the early 1980s. He claimed that it was greyish brown, looked like a small boulder and about the size of a car tyre.<br>However, I have seen large red-eared turtles (the kind that you can buy at the fish shop) with chinese character markings on them in Seletar. Apparently, some people buy and release them as good luck charms in the reservoir.  Those that I saw in Seletar were let go some years back, as their size was 5 to 6 times of the young ones you can buy from the fish shop.</div>

After all the saltwater croc is one of the most dangerous creature you can find.<br><br>Some unit like the armour now have anti-croc drill incoporated into their water crossing, something they brought back from australia, think 2 SAR with 5 rounds on the 2 safety boat. It is a good drill, but after reading so much on crocodiles, think they should have 10 round each. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br></div>

Anyway Tekong reservoir is too small and too shallow for any large wildlife. BTW the temple is still 10 minutes walk away from the crossing point (you must have got muddled up with the last rest point before the crossing site).<br><br>On other story<br><br><blockquote>second hand story, which has no collaboration. A regular NCO told me that he encountered a giant land tortoise in Seletar Reservoir forest area in the early 1980s. He claimed that it was greyish brown, looked like a small boulder and about the size of a car tyre. </blockquote>I hope it wasn't the tortoise which walked away with a MILES helmet gear. We lost two sets during SAFINCOS, spent next 4 weekends combing the training area for them (somehow traineees dropped them during excercise). Found one 'worn' by a tortise (I kid you not), somehow it must have snagged the equipment and dragged it along for a bit before we found it. If so, say "hi" to her and send her on her way please.<br><br>BTW in Burnei - we had cicadas as big as mess tin (captured by hand then injected with meth spirit), they looked like a huge fly (bug eyes and double wings) and has a nasty habit of flying inside the bunks!! Outside we did not say much except huge spiders, giant ants (~3cm length) etc. Even say fresh water prawns in streams.</div>

By the way, I am living and working in the UK now. Been disrupted from reservist since 1995. Hence, some of my terminology for the SAF is dated.</div>
