            <div class='col-md body'>SINGAPORE : In a sign of the times, the Police Security Command, whose mission is to protect VIPs in Singapore, has seen its <strong>manpower and capabilities increased by a factor of 50 percent over the past four years.<br></strong><br>From simple bodyguard duties, the officers now use the latest hi-tech gear and have greater fire power.<br><br>The incident that led to the start of VIP protection here was the 1950 attempt on the life of governor of the Straits Settlement of Singapore.<br><br>More than half a century later, the job is more complex and more dangerous.<br><strong><br>Where close protection would have been enough in the past, now fully-decked out Counter Assault Teams with high-powered weapons are on hand to neutralise terrorist attacks.<br></strong><strong><br>Working under these demanding conditions means security officers must be experts in close quarter combat, unarmed combat, and weapons handling.<br><br>And now sniper cover has just become part of VVIP protection.<br></strong><br>But the hardware is only as good as the person with his finger on the trigger.<br><br>And it is no easy target.<br><br>At a distant of 185 metres, snipers have to hit a target, called a clay pigeon, that is just 10 centimetres in diameter. If it were a human head, it would have disintegrated.<br><strong><br>One of the latest additions to the Security Command's high tech arsenal are four robots for Counter Improvised Explosive Devices, or IEDs.<br></strong><br>This gives officers a first response capability when facing suspicious items.<br><strong><br>Cameras and eavesdropping devices are also used to help detect undesirable elements who might be planning an attack against any VVIP.<br></strong><br>These Counter Surveillance officers provide a birds' eye view of the surrounding area and can give early warning to the security officers who are guarding the VVIPs.<br><br>Contrary to the human instinct to run from danger, these officers are ready, willing and able to do the opposite to protect lives.<br><br>How do they do it?<br><br>"It's a matter of training, training an officer to react against his natural instincts. To look at the situation, to respond quickly, and not just to react to his own instincts, but to be able to respond with the kind of training that he's been given, and to do it every single time," said Assistant Superintendent Kelvin Sng of the Police Security Command.<br><br>And just how do the families of these men take to them putting their lives on the line for someone else?<br><br>"I explained to them the kind of preparation and training we've gone through. They realise to some extent that their worries are unfounded. I do believe that it's actually an honour to serve in the unit," said ASP Sng. - CNA<br><br></div>

SecCom's CAT, Counter Sniper blahblahblah is just a small squad in SecCom...and shooting at 185m isn't at all difficult. the same can be done at 400m, 800m....no big deal, u just need a higher mag scope and steadier hands. somemore they using AWP which is idiot-proof, u dun really need to turn the 2 knobs much except to compensate for distance, especially in Singapore where the temperature stays relatively the same, doesn't snow and doesn't have heavy rainfall like in Europe or UK/US.<br><br>I have read the newspaper, saw dat the observer is wearing a veil, wah liew....not needed lah. if u have chosen a goodspot and is wearing a suitable colour attire, veil or without veil is the same.<br><br>Selection is 1/5 make it ? ha....dats alot. CAT's role is very very limited loh....could be replaced by STAR also, they also do VIp/VVIp/VVVVVVVVVVVVVIP escort mah.<br><br>Hellweek? aiyah, small case niah....if u are already a SecCom officer, wat else is new liao.</div>

Why, it's common to have a heavy vehicle for the people carrying the heavier stuff.<br><br>Now, im no bodyguard. But i have read up on this sparingly. Perhaps you have drawn a loaded pistol in the confines of a vehicle, under fire, and having to protect your principal? In such conditions, it should be more advisable to exit vehicle before taking aim, and engaging targets.<br><br>Let me tell you something, which you may or may not know of. There is a order somewhere in the GOMs which state clearly that any information released to the media has to go through several layers of vetting, one of which is MSD.<br><br>More often than not, a amount of disinformation is inserted in.<br>Further more, your choice of weapons is slightly flawed. If they were equipped with G36Cs and MP5Ks, what would be the practical purpose?<br><br>A M4 fitted with a Aimpoint and Surefire will do the job just fine. Besides, the heavy guys were filmed carrying full sized MP5s. Why should they use MP5Ks?<br><br>If there's something really missing, it's the usage of HEAVIER weapons by the assault force. A good example of what happens when RPGs and MGs are used against a convoy is shown in Clear and Present Danger.<br><br>But the people higher up thought of that, didn't they? So there'd be 40mm AGLs and Armbursts *somewhere*<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Brother Jonhson,the purpose of having a H&amp;K MP-5K or G36C is such that hard-hitting automatic fire-power can be deployed.And you point bout the M4 with Aimpoint,thats not a bad choice too.The idea of bodyguarding is,that when confronted with danger,the bodyguards will swiftly,evacuated the principle[the person being being protected] and ensure he{the principle] is not met with any danger.And after that,go after the baddies.And you said something bout them having Armbursts and 40mm GLs?NAhz...I don't think so.It will do too much collateral damage to the area and likely hood of injuring civilians is too great.So the thing is that no matter what weapon you use,you must be able to get your principle out ALIVE.<br><br>And me comparing the fact bout the guys in suits drawing their guns only after exiting the vehicle not making tactical sense is this.Look,you are in a vehicle,and the fact is that the vehicle is armoured.So,you have time to draw your weapon and make sure you are locked and loaded,while the Tatical team are behind shooting the crap out of the baddies,thus occupying them and covering you.And upon exiting,you may be met with some tango who is willing to shoot you point blank.So,having a gun drawn,it will at least give you a split second more to engage the tango instead of having to draw.Think of it this way,you have a gun and you are already in the midst of a gunfight,would you wait till you are outta protection then draw your gun or will you make sure that the moment you are out of the vehicle,anyone who tries to be funny with you is met with a hail of accurate and deadly 9mms?<br><br>Think about it.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>well...1 simple reason why u should not shoot from inside the vehicle, if they have a RPG, they just need to whack the vehicle to kill all the people....1 stone kill all birds. if u are outside the vehicle, u still have time to dive for cover. sigh....alot of things is outside theory one and there is more than reason why MP-5 is used...dun look at it from 'i-know-firearms-more-than-you-do' angle....such knowledge doesn't apply here....there is so much to learn and unless u are in SecCom or STAR or specialised law enforcement unit, else u won't pick it up.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Johnston,I'm going to say it one last time:Step 1,Draw arms in vehicle,Step 2,Lock and Load,Step 3,De-bus/exit vehicle,Step 4,move principle to a safe place/escape vehicle and Step 5,Engage the hostiles.<br><br>And why did I say that the guys in the suits,should retun and help with the firefight?Simple,think of it this way,in the scenario shown,you have four tactical officers engaging an unknown number of hostiles.However they do know your number.So,what if you were one of the four tactical officers who are severly out-numbered?Wearin Level III body armour doesn't make you god you know.And simply having another guy who knows what to do on your side helping you out makes a difference.<br><br>And my point of them having something firing 5.56 like the G-36C is that it will penetrate a vehicle's engine block.Which I doubt a 9mm can do.So,a carbine weapon like G-36C,M-4,Car-15,Colt Commandoes are essential too.Since they are a roving motorcade,how can have snipers to cover every part of the route right?Even mobilise entire SPF sniper unit plus request SAF snipers to join also not enough to cover lorz...And so far,none of this has happened yet.Correct me if i'm wrong,but even durin President Bush's visit,there is no choppers trailing the convoy neither is there so many snipers deployed around the motorcade.<br><br>And imagine,what a .50cal sniper rifle like the Barret Light Fifty can do to your armoured motorcade?And a couple of LAWS or RPGS to add alittle spice to the already hot firepower involved?</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Oh before I forget,Johnston,its not impossibe to get all douple taps in the Alpha region.I can slowly aim and take all day.Its about speed and accuracy here mate.It defeats the purpose if you shoot very accurately but take an a full 10minutes to engage 6 targets.And yes,I do agree that it is not easy to do so in a firefight,but in real-life,what counts is not the amount of Alphas you get.But the point here is that,you shoot the bugger,and make sure he goes down,and stays down.If he doesn't,give him a couple more so that you get a life insurance that the bugger stays down.</div>
