              <blockquote>While a terrorist incident is highly visible, espionage cases
                                      are not. In 1982, the ISD exposed and expelled two Russian spies
                                      for espionage activities in Singapore. One was Anatoly Alexeyevich
                                      Larkin, a Soviet military intelligence (GRU) officer, who attempted
                                      to cultivate a SAF army officer holding the rank of 2nd Lieutenant
                                      to conduct espionage against the SAF.<br> <br> The other was Alexander Alexandrovich Bondarev, another Soviet
                                      military intelligence officer, who was sent to take over a Soviet
                                      spy network which had a local agent working for it since the
                                      1970s.<br> <br> More recent cases include the ones when the ISD arrested two
                                      persons in 1997 and another 4 persons in 1998 under the ISA for
                                      involvement in espionage and foreign subversive activities
                                      prejudicial to the security of Singapore.<br> <br> Of the two persons arrested in 1997, one was a male Singapore
                                      Permanent Resident who was a deep-cover operative of a foreign
                                      intelligence service. He had used the other, a female Singaporean,
                                      as a collaborator.<br> <br> Of the four Singapore citizens detained in 1998, three were
                                      controlled agents for a foreign intelligence agency. One of them
                                      recruited the fourth person to collect intelligence on and to
                                      subvert a local community organisation.<br> <br> All six of them have been released.</blockquote>

              <h1 class="firstHeading">Singapore, a major commercial hub with loose export controls on weapons, both served as a transshipment point for weapons destined for Iraq, as well as providing chemical warfare precursors and being a site for manufacture, under license, of foreign-designed weapons.</h1>

"There is no point the <a title="Department of Trade and Industry" href="/wiki/Department_of_Trade_and_Industry"><span style="color: #0066cc;">Department of Trade and Industry</span></a> (DTI) ticking the box and saying, "They say this is going to our friendly neighbour Austria," or, "This is going to our dear old friend Singapore."

              <h2><span class="mw-headline">Mine warfare</span></h2>
              <p>Some of the most vivid images of the Iran-Iraq war were of Iranian volunteers charging into minefields, to clear them by sacrificing their own lives. Mine warfare in the Persian Gulf was one of the U.S. justifications for direct military action against Iran. It is relevant, then, to identify the sources of those mines.</p>
              <p><a id="Italian_mine_warfare_technology" name="Italian_mine_warfare_technology"></a></p>
              <h3><span class="mw-headline">Italian mine warfare technology</span></h3>
              <p>Italy exported land and naval mines both to Iraq and Iran before and during the Iran-Iraq War. Its mine industry revolved around three small companies: Valsella, Misar, and Tecnovar. The latter two were formed by former Valsella employees. All three specialized in landmines and mine-related products and were involved in direct exports and licensed overseas production. Most of their revenues came from exporta, driven by favorable banking and export controls, and public support of military development. <sup id="cite_ref-LMitaly_1-0" class="reference"><a href="/forums/1164/topics/#cite_note-LMitaly-1"><span style="color: #0066cc;">[2]</span></a></sup></p>
              <p>Given the importance of minefields, sometimes cleared with nothing but Iranian bravery, the significance of mines cannot be underestimated. See <a title="Italian support for Iraq during the Iran-Iraq war" href="/wiki/Italian_support_for_Iraq_during_the_Iran-Iraq_war"><span style="color: #0066cc;">Italian support for Iraq during the Iran-Iraq war</span></a> for the original Italian role when it directly exported mines, which, after the Italian government enforced export controls, moved its manufacturing to Singapore, using explosives from <a title="Oerlikon" href="/wiki/Oerlikon"><span style="color: #0066cc;">Oerlikon</span></a> of <a title="Switzerland" href="/wiki/Switzerland"><span style="color: #0066cc;">Switzerland</span></a>.</p>
              <p><a id="Move_of_Italian_work_to_Singapore" name="Move_of_Italian_work_to_Singapore"></a></p>
              <h3><span class="mw-headline">Move of Italian work to Singapore</span></h3>
              <p>"With the outbreak of the Iran-Iraq war in September 1980, Valsella began receiving government authorizations for exports to Iraq. A total of seven were granted, the last one issued in 1982 and expiring in January of 1984. The overall value of the exports amounted to more than US $110 million. But political pressures resulted in increasing restrictions on exports to Iraq. To skirt these restrictions, the company set up a new branch abroad in Singapore, where assembled mines with Vasella components and explosive from <a title="Bofors" href="/wiki/Bofors"><span style="color: #0066cc;">Bofors</span></a> in <a title="Sweden" href="/wiki/Sweden"><span style="color: #0066cc;">Sweden</span></a>, for shipment to Iraq in 1982. Mines were exported to Iraq until 1986.</p>
              <p>In 1984, Fiat gradually gained control over Valsella and Misar. By this time Valsella mainly focused on the R&amp;D of increasingly sophisticated landmines (like electronic mines and mines with remote control activation, with radio crypto-coded signals), while Misar carried out considerable research and development of naval mines, though not to the exclusion of land systems</p>
              <p><a id="Chemical_warfare" name="Chemical_warfare"></a></p>
              <h2><span class="mw-headline">Chemical warfare</span></h2>
              <p>In December 2002, Iraq's 1,200 page Weapons Declaration revealed a list of Eastern and Western corporations and countries—as well as individuals—that exported chemical and biological materials to Iraq in the past two decades. By far, the largest suppliers of precursors for chemical weapons production were in Singapore (4,515 tons). The Kim Al-Khaleej firm of Singapore supplied more than 4,500 tons of VX, sarin, and mustard gas precursors and production equipment to Iraq. No searches on this firm have had hits other than for this topic, suggesting it might be a front company for Iraqi procurement.</p>
              <p>"Chief U.N. weapons inspector Hans Blix came to similar conclusions on Jan. 27, [2002] when he delivered an "update" to the U.N. Security Council based on his inspection efforts in Iraq according to Timmerman, "...Blix's recent report to the United Nations documented many other instances in which Iraq has failed to disclose prohibited weapons. The Iraqi documents, revealed here for the first time, portray a worldwide procurement network that relied on top-drawer assistance from governments and major banks in Europe, Asia and the Middle East. Iraq's suppliers range from huge multinational corporations... little-known entities, such as an outfit identified by the Iraqis as "Kim Al-Khalleej" of Singapore, which they claimed supplied more than 4,500 tons of VX-, sarin- and mustard-gas precursors and production equipment."</p>
              </div>
              <p>The Iraqi disclosure mentioned various companies that have acted as third-country buyers for Iraq..."during the Iran-Iraq war India delivered precursors for warfare agents to Iraq - and later was found to have delivered quantities of the same materials to Iran. Baghdad's middleman at the time, an Iraqi with a German passport, founded a company in Singapore expressly for this purpose."</p>

              <p>Maybe lionnoisy is trying to do his part to keep national secrets safe by spreading misinformation...</p>
              <p>Things like rumours of F-18Es being ski-jumped off LHDs (or mini-cvs) as he calls them and rollerblades for our SAF troopers plus crashing Fantail into targets will certainly confuse any spy trying to use sgforums as a source of info.</p>

              <p>That was when the former Solicitor-General of Singapore - Mr Francis Seow - attempted to make a strong entry into Singapore Politics during the mid-1980's, and posed a threat to the planned ascension of LHL to the PM post.</p>
              <p>The Singapore Government claimed that the coffee house meeting between Mr Francis Seow and a senior US Embassy staff had conducted some kind of clandestine activity that interfered with Singapore's politics.</p>
              <p>Francis Seow was arrested, and the US Embassy staff had his diplomatic privileges removed and asked to leave Singapore.</p>

              <p>Incidentally, Singapore is no angel either, as the Malaysian had reported the arrest of at least two Singaporeans for espionage near a Malaysian naval facility - and when LKY was asked, for his response, he did say that ''this is no surprise, we do it, they do it, everyone does it''.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>From the Singapore Window  - it was reported that during SingTel attempt to takeover the Australian Optus Telco, the Aussies were uncomfortable that a national security asset was being taken over by a foreign government agency.</p>
              <p>During the course of corporate manoevering that generated public debate, ABC attempted to throw some light into the debate through interviews with personalities knowledgeable to the issues - extracts of the transcript provide some eye-opening details unknown to Singaporeans:-</p>

              <p><em><span style="color: #0000ff;"><span style="font-family: Arial; ">Given the close links between SingTel and the Singaporean government, the national security issue has provoked both public debate and deep concern in some sections of Australia's intelligence community.</span></span></em></p>

              <p>seriously, we need to get real. Despite all these being said, typical 5th column activites have never stopped since man started something called war. What we have to understand tho is that we have to also open our eyes and ears. Especially in times like this where S'pore is getting more and more cosmopolitan. Those foreign talents and ah tiongs coming in..we cant be 100% they are not potential spies or even agents working without diplomatic cover. Even the japanese as far back as the 2nd world war considered the duty of every citizen to forward intelligence gathered by their nationals abroad (See Ban kah Choon, <em>Absent History</em>). So the same could be said of these new influx of ah tiongs and what have you...</p>
              <p>Bottomline...be careful of wat you say...you never know who's listening...</p>
              <p> </p>

              <p>Well not really a  fumduck lar.  Its not easy to subvert higher ranking officers as most of them are very careful of what they say to people outside the SAF.</p>
              <p>Subverting a junior officer would be easier since they are not as highly paid and cautious.  Of course, there is the question of "What would subverting a junior officer do?"  After all, a junior officer is not gonna handle highly confidential documents or have intimate details of secret projects. Should be quite useless to any case officer rite?</p>
              <p>That unfortunately is not true.  A junior officer is still someone inside the organization itself and would have, or be able to find out who has the required information.  From there, a likely scenario would be that the subverted junior officer would identify a more senior ranking officer, and consequently, be placed under surveillance by foreign intelligence.  Certain foreign intelligence agencies were quite notorious for blackmailing at one point of time, and coercing some of these senior officers with questionable lifestyle habits would have been easy.</p>
              <p>I guess, what I am saying is that, even the subversion a 2Lt can lead to severe breaches of security.</p>

              <p>I also did some espionage on our noisy little lion, apparently he did speak about his military "experience" in NS before in an old post that I managed to find.</p>

              </blockquote>
              <p>Wow, explains his lack of knowledge of infantry tactics, firearms, and anything military in general if this is to be believed.</p>
              <p>It's funny how all the way back in '05 he's already on his disasterous one-track mind. He tried to claim the SAR-21 as superior to the then XM8!</p>
              <p>I like the way he went about the XM8</p>
              <blockquote>
              <p>It is so big.</p>
              </blockquote>
              <p>When it is just 3 cm longer then the SAR, and that is with butt EXTENDED. If the butt isn't extended it is actually SMALLER then the SAR.</p>
              <p>And lighter too.</p>
              <p>Speaks volumes about his intellectual intergity, sockpuppeting isn't really unexpected from him.</p>
