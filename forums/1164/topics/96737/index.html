            <div class='col-md body'>Dude.. Lots of things can happen in a hundred years. Why don't we give ourselves a easier time scale to look at? A hundred years is going to be a Long-Run scenario.<br><br>The Long-Run doesn't matter because we'll be dead, therefore unable to appreciate it.<br><br>In the next 10 years? 20 years? that's a more appreciable time-scale to look into.<br><br>In my best opinion, No. We are not an aggressor force. Therefore, SAF will likely only be utilised if there is a clear and present danger to our statehood. There is currently no such threat.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Dear Pal, I think we'll have to be realistic here, no doubt we may have a good tie with the US and a strong standing in the UN, but this are not justification for us to be complacent...<br><br>Firstly, our good relationship with the US lies mainly due to the interest (Establishments, trade etc...) we have in each other... if this factor is absent, i believe the US could'nt care less for a tiny country like us... furthermore, if Singapore were to be involved in a war, i doubt that they would come to our aid~ the cost involved is just to great... the interest that the US have here is just too minimal for them to come all the way here, we are unlike Taiwan which provides a buffer between them and China, thus they are more likely defend Taiwan compared to Singapore... Do not forget that the US is acting like a boss in the world, getting much involved in various international affairs. Would they have the ability to be deeply involved in Singapore's affair?? seriously i doubt so...<br><br>Secondly, no doubt the strong standing in the UN would provide a certain deterance against aggressors... but please bear in mind that Singapore is just a tiny country, unlike Iraq which US needs to take quite some time to take over, a well-planned operation would take us down within a short period of time (Presumed that SAF is complacent)... By the time UN gathers their member country, dispatch their peacekeepers... (which usually take months)... we would have fell...<br><br>Therefore, having a strong SAF and the will to defend our country is the only way to prevent this... I think its naive to think that people would come to our aid when time comes... Just a piece of my thoughts though.... no offence...<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>For better or worse, IMO Singapore is the most obvious SE Asian nation that's trying to keep the USA engaged in this region. My take is they wanna formally withdraw - see shutdown of Clark Air Base in the Philippines - to focus more on NE Asia as far as this side of the world goes.<br><br>That's why we refitted Changi Naval Base (to facilitate them), &amp; also why Australia chest-thumped about "deputy sheriff" - both saw a plausible military vaccum resulting from such a development.<br><br>A lot can happen in 5, 10 years, let alone 100.<br><br>The Spratly Islands is a flashpoint.<br><br>Taiwan is a flashpoint.<br><br>Pan-Islam movements (not just al-Queda &amp; the JI) have simmering in southern Thailand, southern Phillippines, &amp; certain parts of Indonesia for a long time.<br><br>Indonesia is also densely populated, some 2/3s of the USA population.<br><br>All of them can impact the geopolitical balance &amp; affect us directly.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Let's get our perspective right first...<br><br>Singapore is only an INDEPENDENT country for 39 years... not even half a century...<br><br>100 years ago, we were a British colony, what makes you think 100 years from now, we'll still be independent?? In 1959, nobody, including LKY could even imagine S'pore being independent, hence merger...<br><br>But looking at the regional situation, i dun think there is any reason for any country to attack us, except mayb if we irritate our neighbours so much, they'll want to get rid of this rich and proud Chinese dominated country...<br><br>However, I think the threat is more economic, rather then military... The worst scenario will be Singapore is so redundant in the global economy that there is no economic growth... and Singapore is forced to merge with a larger entity... whatever that may be........................ and Singapore will cease to be an independent country without a fight... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_sad.gif" alt="Sad" title="Sad"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Let's face the facts, anything can happen in 2 years much less 100 years.<br>Look at it this way, there have been major struggles throughout hsitory. Here's an extremely brief example:<br><br>2001 to Present: War on Terrorism<br>1945 to 1991: Cold War (14 years ago)<br>1939 to 1945: WW2 (59 years ago)<br>1914 to 1919: WW1(85 years ago)<br><br>To be frank, humanity has not even had 10 years of total peace at any time in history so how can you ask for <strong>100</strong>. Our track record is pathetic. The wars I've listed are the "major" wars, between them you have the Gulf War, Vietnam &amp; Korea as well as smaller conflicts like our own struggle against the Communists and the Konfrontasi with Indonesia.<br><br>With these facts in mind, we are more likely to "rest in peace" then to expect lasting peace...<br><br>On another note, a strong standing in the UN is only a good thing if the UN itself is strong. The UN was created after WW2 to prevent further wars. In fact, the FIRST purpose of the UN is to "to save succeeding generations from the scourge of war, which twice in our lifetime has brought untold sorrow to mankind". Yet, it seems that the UN itself has been dragged into conflicts like Korea and Iraq. With the USA even ignoring the UN and so many countries actually declaring that they'll launch pre-emptive, do you think the UN is really as strong as we'd like it to be?<br><br>Ties with superpowers, buffer zones and a strong armed forces are good deterrents but they are not guarantees... 100 years is a really big question mark to me...</div>
