            <div class='col-md body'>After seeing the movie 'Pearl Harbour' recently on tv, i realise that we are very fortunate to live in such a peaceful country. We mustn't take peace for granted and must always be prepare to face a crisis (terrorist/war) for singapore if it ready happen. No one know for sure ,who will be the attackers'.<br><br>I feel that we must be contended enough and not complaining about the little things in life during peace time compare it to a war.... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br></div>
