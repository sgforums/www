              <p>It has been recently reported that the RAAF shot down a target drone at a range  of 5 km  BEHIND a Hornet  using an ASRAAM.</p>
              <p>Targeting data was send to  launch aircraft  via Link 16 &amp; was provided by another platform . The ASRAAM was used in a LOAL mode.</p>
              <p>Wonder if RSAF can perform this trick with a AIM9X or other missile.  </p>

              <p>Erm... well I guess we can try... But to what purpose does it serve?</p>
              <p>The Hornet should have been toast already.  Kinematic performance of the missile fired by the "bandit" behind it, would be superior than a rear-war or u-turning ASRAAM.</p>

              <p>This demonstrates the worth of ASRAAM's LOAL mode coupled with HMS. It gives a Gen 3, Gen4 the ability to defeat super agile opponents like the Migs and the Sukhois.</p>

              <p>Okay, so the enemy is just a pilot flying his ejection seat trying to throw darts at the Hornet, is that what you are suggesting?</p>
              <p>If you wanna consider such a situation where a rear-ward firing ASRAAM is useful, lets just consider a potential match up.</p>
              <p>Hornet w/ ASRAAM vs Su-30MK w/ R-73 Archer.</p>
              <p>What kind of situation will a rearward firing ASRAAM be useful.</p>
              <p>1. On the merge, both sides will probably fire off as soon as they can, double kill.</p>
              <p>2.  Su-30 jumps the Hornet, gets onto his 6 o'clock. In such a scenario, the Su-30 better have missiles or else it has no reason to be there instead of bugging out.  Save the "I'm going in for guns" for the movies.</p>
              <p>People make decent assumptions when comparing capabilities.  Definitely not flying ejection seat vs Hornet w/ ASRAAM.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>A few rare scenarios for this capability to be useful.  Hornet 1 engaged defensive against bandit.  Hornet 2 locks on to the bandit but is unable to engage due to dangers of fatricide and stays further back.  Hornet 1 shoots the ASRAAM via data-link in a LOAL mode. </p>
              <p>That is the only realistic scenario i can think of at the moment.</p>

              <p>Haha! </p>
              <p>Seriously, the flying ejection seat was a joke.  But it was really meant to draw an exaggeration of what you were suggesting, eg, fail-R-73s, Guns-engagement against a missile armed opponents.</p>
              <p>Those are considerations that are inappropriate or impossible.</p>
              <p>Firstly, is it not unwise to consider our opponents to have inferior or failing weapons when considering potential tactical advantages of new technology?  </p>
              <p>Secondly, why consider situations that will never happen in combat?  "I'm going in for guns" do not happen.  Any combat pilot worth his salt knows when not to fight.  Air combat today isn't exactly like it was in the days of Baron Von Richtofen nor Vietnam. </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Hence in scenarios, why do I not consider a rear-hemisphere ASRAAM very useful? Simple reason, why hold the shot when I can plug one (better still, two) in his face on the merge?  </p>
              <p>The Sneaky-30 coming up on the Hornet's rear position doesn't really add up either.  The ASRAAM doesn't have very long legs, and a U-turn will burn up more fuel and get nowhere, hence even shorter range.  Thus, a R-73 can be launched further out and nail the Hornet.  </p>
              <p>Therefore, the only possibility i could think of, was a low-level turning fight against the Su-30 class threat, with rearward firing missiles to clear the defensive fighter's 6 without fatricide.  The only problem with this scenario is that, it is a very bad situation that should never happen. </p>
              <p>The way I see it, the significance of this experiment has little to do with the ASRAAM.  But rather the ability to hand off-targeting of a weapon to a 3rd party, and still achieve a kill.   The same idea with handing off AMRAAM inertial updates to a 3rd party until active range.  Let's say I have a boosted version of the ASRAAM that allows it to get to about 40km with LOAL and updates from AWACs.  These updates can bring the missile in range such that its own Passive IR seekers can locate its own target.  The target won't know what hit them.</p>

              <p>You're right.  Once someone rolls in on the 6'o'clock position, the pilot would instinctively execute a max g-turn and dump flares fully expecting an incoming heater-shot.   I cannot emphasize how automatic and important that process is, and how often a heater-shot really would occur, which is like probably 80% of the time.  </p>
              <p>In any circumstance, the incoming heater would track for the aircraft's engines unless the pilot is able to turn his hot exhaust away from the heater's seeker, and drop a whole bunch of flares to decoy the missile.  Hence, no pilot would fly straight into a defensive against a heater shot, which makes the entire rear-quadrant engagement questionable.</p>
              <p>What I do believe is significant is not as much as the rear-quadrant launch, but the ability to target with weapons via Link-16.  If you're familiar with slightly more legacy F-16s, we don't get to do that with AMRAAMs or Sidewinders.  We may know who our wingmen are targetting, but we can't shoot weapons based on what our wingmen have designated on their FCR.   I'm not sure what it is like today, but I imagine it has not deviated very far since this "rear-quadrant, link-16" launch was so hyped up.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Success rates of the AIM120 (B-C5s) have been more than impressive if you consider what it was meant to replace, ie AIM7.  The AIM120 will *almost* assure a 100% kill if it was launched within its NEZ (No Escape Zone).   Naturally, most engagements would occure outside the NEZ, where its success is largely determined by how alert and sharp the opposing pilot is.  And honestly, that is hard to explain without explaining in rather good detail BVR engagement tactics.  What I am saying is, depending on that enemy's "attitude", and range, the AIM120's kill probability will vary.  Any missile can be kinematically defeated given sufficient distance. </p>
              <p>Not sure about the R-73's performance in combat.  I imagine it should be equivalent to at least an AIM-9M/L's performance aside for its off boresight capabilities.</p>

              <p>Even Jane's IDR doesn't have information of the condition those AIM-120s were fired in.  That is the nature of BVR missiles as the target's aspect, altitude, airspeed and capability to accelerate, play an important part in defeating the missile.</p>
              <p>Without understanding the concept of the "No Escape Zone" and the "Weapons Engagement Zone" and the effects of target aspect, altitude and airspeed have on them, its hard to explain to you the probability of kill.</p>
              <p>To compare the AIM-9's pK to the AIM-120's is really comparing apples and oranges.  One is fired within visual range, with the target fairly close to the aircraft, the other is where the target is "conservatively" 20 nmiles out. Unless we compare the pK of the 2 weapons fired within the same perimeters, eg, "3 miles out, from a 6'o clock position at 500knots", there is nothing to compare.  In such a condition, I'm sure the AIM-120 will achieve greater than 90% despite chaff/flare counter measures + break turns. </p>
              <p>Unfortunately, they are different waepons for a different purpose, and hence comparing the pK directly isn't going to go anywhere.  Where the 120 can go, the AIM9 can only dream or fall like a rock to the ground.</p>
              <p>As for the R-73, all I can say is that it is a credible threat in WVR.  If its performance is only limited to the AIM9L/M, why would the Americans rush to create a new WVR missile called the AIM9X to match it's capabilities?</p>

              <p>just to clarify..the aussie's chose the AIM-132 for the hornets ASRAAM (and the f-35 at this stage),  we seem to think they are OK </p>
              <p>the 24 transitional super hornets (12 wired as growlers) on order will come with standard USN weapons and will have AIM-9x so they are operational from day 1,  there is no plan to spend the time or money to incorporate the AIM-132 on the supers at this stage</p>

              <p>i found this site worth a read, russia has some good missiles coming</p>
              <p>http://www.ato.ru/rus/cis/archive/17-2007/def/def3/</p>
              <p>Vympel expects to complete its development of the short-range Izdeliye
              760 missile — which is a significantly modernized version of the R-73
              weapon, outfitted with an inertial flight control system and course
              correction receiver, improved rocket engine and with new multi-mode
              infrared seeker. The Izdeliye 760 is expected to be a close counterpart
              to the Western-built ASRAAM and Sidewinder AIM-9X missiles.</p>

              <p>Thats right.  Same goes to say for the 9X and Python 4-5. </p>
              <p>However, even if dumping flares and executing max-g break turns into the missile doesn't work much, its still better than not doing anything.  Who knows?  Turning hard into the missile may cause its mechanical components enough stress for it to fail, by sheer luck?</p>
              <p>Sepecat, sure go ahead and believe what you will.  </p>
              <p>I do consider myself familiar with some parts of shooting an AMRAAM though not to its entirety.  There are several of considerations to making a good AMRAAM shot. Most of them are concerns over the missile's ability to reach the target with sufficient energy to make the smash.  The aircraft's fire control radar and computers usually calculates that and the HUD symbology would relay that information to the pilot over the missiles potential ability to kill the target based on energy state calculations.  Is that "Theory?" I leave that to you to decide.</p>
              <p>I am less inclined to statistical pK to gauge a missile for a few reasons.  </p>
              <p>Firstly, the sample size isn't large enough.  Just barely more than a dozen shots doesn't say for sure how reliable the weapon is, and especially so if they included earlier production batches of the weapon.  </p>
              <p>Secondly, accurate statistics should be done like scientific experiments in controlled environments.  I'm pretty darn sure whatever statistics available weren't done in such a situation where you have equally experienced pilots, and launch conditions.</p>
              <p>There used to be this Hughes/Raytheon "guide" on AMRAAM operations available of F-16.net, but I can't seem to find it now.  It explains the DLZs in much greater detail than I'm willing to regurgitate here.  Its not a very classified thing since a lot of information is freely available on the net.  The only thing I remember to be classified still is the "burn-time."</p>

              <p>Surely any pilot shud dump flares , chaff ,  turn into the missile etc if he's got a AAM on his tail.  As I said AAMs  do not always work as advertised &amp; the pilot can count on the modern AAMs not working 100 % &amp; must do everything to counter the AAM.</p>
              <p>A good  number of  the relatively modern AIM9L/Ms, Python 3s &amp; Shafrir 2s have been fired in actual combat &amp; the statistics on their Pk comes from a sizable  sample size. Anyone has the numbers ?</p>
              <p>However, for the newer missiles such as AIM120s real combat situations are not many. But  if  17 have been fired in real combat with only 9 kills, it  does tell you generally the  probability  of  achieving a kill with this AAM.   </p>

              <p>Honestly, statistics do lie.  Statistics can give us an idea what kinda of problem we are facing, but it doesn't tell us the source of the problem. </p>
              <p>For example, the AIM-7's abysmmal combat record had to be analysed to understand why there was a flaw in the idea of a Semi-Active Radar Homing missile.  It had to be guided all the way in order to achieve a kill.  Although it provided a lot of reach, it limited the pilot tactically, and was limited by the constraint of the illuminating radar versus target's RCS and/or aspect.  These are factors that statistics don't say.</p>
              <p>The AIM-120 has gone through several revisions ever the first one was fired in the Gulf War.  It is a missile that is still undergoing revisions, and previous flaws being rectified and capabilities improved.  Statistics do not tell us that as well.  </p>
              <p>Hence, it is more empirical to understand the dynamics of the missile's kill probability than just to examine the statistics.  Its not that the statistics isn't important, but its only a very surface level indication of problems.  </p>
              <p>The weapon's engagement zone for the AMRAAM is dynamic, but it can achieve very high kill probabilities if the target is close enough or the energy state disparity great enough in favor of the shooter.  It can guide itself to its target once active, or it can even home in on jamming emmission until it can burn through.  With newer rockets, it's end-game profile has also become more deadly as it now has more energy to defeat manuevering targets.  These things, statistics do not tell.  </p>
              <p>As far as it's class of missiles are concerned, in my opinion, its leading the pack in terms of operational use and revisions. </p>

              <p>At about 50 % Pk for AIM 120  in real combat  &amp;  even in scenarios  where the victors  had air superiority,  it is still an excellent record compared to other BVR missiles such as AIM7s. However , the statistics do tell you that compared to AIM7s  , AIM120s are a vast improvement.</p>
              <p>In the absence of data to show that there are currently BVR missiles with better combat rrecords tham AIM120s there is no doubt that  the AIM120  is the leader of the pack. With the AIM120D coming on stream ,  it will probably stay ahead for some time to come.</p>
