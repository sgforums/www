            <div class='col-md body'>source: Flight international<br>Date   : 21/03/06<br><br>Thailand has drafted a requirement for three airborne early warning and control (AEW&amp;C) aircraft as part of a new nine-year spending plan. Industry sources expect Bangkok will only consider small platforms, such as the Embraer ERJ-145 and Saab 2000. The requirement calls for the purchase of three aircraft Â“capable for AEW&amp;CÂ”, but stipulates that only two should be fully equipped.<br><br>The Swedish government has already offered to sell Thailand Saab 2000s with Ericsson Erieye radars as part of a proposal to supply the country with the Saab/BAE Systems Gripen fighter.<br><br>The Thai air force is now evaluating the Gripen, Lockheed Martin F-16C/D and Sukhoi Su-30 for its new fighter requirement.<br><br>ThailandÂ’s recently drafted wishlist includes 12 to 18 new multirole fighters, six transport aircraft each capable of carrying at least 40 troops, 12 8.5t combat search-and-rescue helicopters and six unmanned air vehicles.<br><br>Looks like soon we won't be the only one in this region to have AEW&amp;C capability .. erh .. how ah  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_eek.gif" alt="Shocked" title="Shocked"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Its not say like or don't like. The problem is whether its realistic or not. The prospect of us having an aircraft carrier even a small one in the next 5-10 years is not very likely.<br><br>Sure we have the money and can acquire the technology but do we have enough people to staff this aircraft carrier? Unlikely, because Singapore's birth rate have been decreasing steadily over the years even with baby bonus this trend is not about to be reversed any time soon. I don't think RSN want foreign talent to staff our pride of the SAF too.<br><br>Assuming we do have an CBG,which is meant as a show of force, where can they sail then? Our own terriotorial waters is already tiny and further more being cluttered with commercial shipping as we are an important stopover port of call. We sail into Straits of Malacca, the Indonesian and our friendly Malaysian foreign miniters will be knocking(maybe even banging) at our embassy doors in record time. Sail into South China Sea, we may be caught in the squabbles between the various claimants of the Spartly islands namely Malaysia,PRC,ROC,Brunei,Philippines and Vietnam. That is one very volatile area in this region.<br><br>Lastly we have 4 relatively new Endurance class LST which have already proven their versatility in both peace time and war time operations. If i am not wrong RSN rejected a bigger design of the LST by ST Marine and chose the Endurance class instead.<br><br>Personally i will wish RSN to have a small 2nd hand aircraft carrier just like what the Thai navy had but its just a fantasy at the moment because it will not be realistic, at least for the time being. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"></div>

The SAF has a total mobilised strength of 350,000, I totally dun buy the argument that we dun have enough manpower...<br><br>Jus ask around, people will say : " Aiya Spore not enuff soldiers la " This is a comment that irks me to no end. Someone ought to educate those people who dun noe what they are blabbering about, especially those taxi drivers who think they know everything. There was once I booked out during my NSF days and this taxi driver looked at me and said:" Waste of time Spore how to defend, ppl drop one bomb finish liaoz " I felt like punching him.<br><br>If they knew so much and were so clever, they would not be taxi drivers in the first place.

            <div class='col-md body'>You want a staff an asset like a aircraft carrier with reservists! you've gotta be kidding me.<br>Our total strength includes NSF leh.  If i'm not mistaken only 70% are regulars. Taking into account how many are in logistics and support as well as HQ staffers. Then it takes a crew of at least 1000 to operate a carrier. Not to mention sufficient escorts. Let's say we need 6 surface ships as escorts. At 80 per surface ship that's at least 640 men for the escorts. So we have a 1,600 sailors being used up.<br>Our frigates are ALL being used up to protect this asset. Leaving us every thing on big surface ships. Seriously. What kind of money and support are we talking about here? it's MASSIVE!!! i'd rather we bought 12 more frigates with that kind of money and requirements.<br><br>Edit:Anyway we're off topic here.To get back on topic I'm wondering why the Thais are suddenly decide to spend so much. 1st new fighters,now AWE&amp;C and if i'm not mistaken more tanks too right? Looking to replace the M60s?</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Are you sure the manpower for operating an Aircraft Carrier like Chakri Naruebet requires a thousand pple. Apparently, with sophisticated integrated combat management technology massive manpower necessities on the ship are significantly reduced an excellent ie.the delta Frigate and Endurance Class. Anyway, remain skeptical about the procurement of an aircraft carrier. The SAF would rather allocate the fund to the Airforce "Above All" ya!! Acquire more F-15SG and JASSM  if the US congress give the nod<br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>LPD will be good also nah.<br><br>with aircraft carrier or LPD we can do a lot of things, the waters ard here are very congested but see, these waters are ours and we must look to ourselves as guardians of this busy waterway. If an aggressor sends their CBG to our doorstep yes we have a few credible surface ships but realistically it's pretty futile odds dun u think, we can sink 1 or 2 but a CBG ....... there is no fair contest .. KNOCKOUT punch ... K.O !! end of story.<br><br>But if we have our own CBG in this theatre there is still a contest and no KO. Somemore our new navy base can accomodate and resupply 2 x Number 12 american shoe size carriers, 4 of them if need be so we already have the facilities in place more than enough for 1 pocket carrier or a few LPD.<br><br>But the main reason is cuz we are so small and who is to say a surprise pre-emptive strike on our key facilities won't clean us out. But if we have our own CBG it means a large part of our forces and systems are "forward based" in an unfixed locations any potential aggressor has to consider that we may still have the capability to provide a strong retaliation after sustaining a first strike.<br><br>ok les get back to the thread.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"></div>
