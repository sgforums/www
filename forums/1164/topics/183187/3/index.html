First,it uses GE F404 engine which is F**king ex and will raise the cost of LCA which already defeat the purpose of building LCA!

It will not be an indigenous fighter anymore.Plus cost rise which will not make it appealing for export!<br><br>For a missile based on SA-6,the rocket boast and aero-dynamic and flight will mostly unchanged? How is it going to be advance even with upgraded guidance system? The G lvl will hardly changed,together with speed,altitude and reaction time.. As someone mention,just becos India Armed Force accept its servcie doesn't meant it is great. Having a indigenous missile will boast the local industries capabilities is I believe the only meaningful purpose. BTW,there is no proof yet the missile will reach max of 60km! It is stated it is still under development! Few yrs ago,they say Kaveri engine will be ready in 2006 but what happen now? LCA is kept on delay and delay... Nothing is comfirmed until really accept in service.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote>Yr name already tells me a system induct into India armed forces and is in bad quality,totally irrelevant! ARJUN MBT is a great example.</blockquote>The Arjun MBT is one of the best MBT's of the world. It is of good quality with the latest tech and can be put in the same category as the MIA1.<br><br><blockquote>Arjun is overweight and the system fail under the harsh environment near the border ard Pakistan.</blockquote>It is true that during tests in the Thar desert where the temperature reaches 60 degrees Arjun engine has failed. It was later rectified. Let me also remind you that a similar test was conducted on the T-90 and it also failed the test. Bring any of your Chinesese tanks and it will also fail the tests.<br><br><blockquote>India armed force induct Arjun into the service just to save face for India. Later they T-90 will still be the main force of India and not their Arjun. </blockquote>The Arjun induction was slow because the army pointed to many changes for the tank and it took time to correct the problems. The main reason for going in for the T-90 is the cost of the Tank. Arjun costs 3 times that of the T-90. So for numerical superiority the army preferred the T-90. For qualitative edge they will be using the Arjun. The army has issued statements saying that the Arjun and the T-90's will be the MBT's of IA.<br><br><blockquote>Did u read quote i paste from yr dear official website of India armed forces?</blockquote>You mean BR. It is not the official website. Except that it contains large information on Indian as well as world military. Regarding the report let me remind you that it appeared in a newspaper. No one knows for sure how true is this report. Before the first flight of the LCA there were even reports of LCA being cancelled and it is not going to fly and many such negative reports which were all false.<br><br><blockquote>It will NOT MAKE IT in scedule and be delay which means it will not be combat ready,plus even inducted,it will just another BUY product</blockquote>You will say the same thing again and again even when it is inducted into the IAF. I will like to remind you that we are developing something from scratch. It may be very easy for a nation which has a sound aviation industry to finish a product. We are on our own and we are determined to succeed. The successful flight of LCA is one of the milestones in Indian aviation and military industry. After the success of LCA you will see many more aircrafts like the MCA already under design taking of the sky within a short period of time. The spinoff's from the LCA is immense from a trainer aircraft IJT (The Sitara) was designed and flown within a record time. It is said that they had created artificial legs for disabled people using the lightweight composite material used to create the wings of the LCA. Some of the Radar warning receivers (Tarang) etc developed for LCA was even used on the Sukhoi-30 MKI's.<br><br>I had never said that only Indian tech is the best and everything else is crap. The Indian tech is one of the best in the world.<br></div>

Â“We should be able to announce the overseas sale of the weapon by the end of this calendar year,Â” A Sivathanu Pillai, chief controller (R&amp;D), DRDO and managing director and CEO, BrahMos Aerospace, told reporters.<br><br>Since this is a joint venture between the Indian and Russian governments, sale to other countries has to be cleared by both, he pointed out.<br><br>Meanwhile, the Indian Navy has accepted the BrahMos system, which will be deployed on the three Talwar class destroyers being built by the Russians.<br><br>Â“We are producing the systems to meet the Indian NavyÂ’s requirements, since the Navy has decided that the BrahMos will be its major weapon for all future ships, whether these are built in India or abroad,Â” Dr Pillai remarked. Referring to the interest generated in countries in the Far East and other parts of the world for the supersonic cruise missile, Dr Pillai said these countries have no equivalent precision strike weapon.<br><br>Integrated trials for a dummy missile on an aircraft are scheduled for this year. This will see the airborne version of the BrahMos for deployment on the SU-30s of the Indian Air Force (IAF). Next year, the avionics will be established.<br>The changes needed for an aircraft-based weapon system will lead to a weight reduction of nearly 2.5 times its current weight since it will not need additional boosters to get airborne.<br><br>Dr Pillai ruled out any other products from the JV.<br>Â“The joint venture was created exclusively for the BrahMos and we have created variants. It is now a multi-platform, multi-target system. We have to undertake trials on submarines and air-based systems. This will create further variants,Â” he observed. The 290-km range, liquid fuel charged, 3-tonne missile carries a warhead of 200 kg conventional explosives. The cruise missile is a weapon of first strike, being a tactical weapon.<br><br>The Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO) will launch two Â“futuristicÂ” programmes during the current Plan period, Dr Pillai said. He was referring to a precision guided missile (PGM) programme to be undertaken at the Pune-based Armament Research and Development Establishment (ARDE).<br><br>Â“The PGM is for the future when intelligent and smart weapons will be needed. Future wars will be rapid, and the weapons will be precise, using the minimum of manpower. So, the ARDE is focused on two programmes, the PGM and the soldier assisted system, where everything from the soldierÂ’s clothes to the weapons used will be embedded with sensors,Â” Dr Pillai said, sketching a sci-fi- like scenario.<br><br>Among the smart weapons will be the precision guided munitions (PGM), which will hit the target precisely to do the maximum damage. This is at a technical demonstration stage, Dr BS Sarma, director, ARDE, stated.<br><br>The country-wide laboratories of the DRDO are working on various aspects of the two projects.<br>Earlier, speaking at the inaugural session of a national seminar on advances in electroceramics, Dr Pillai stressed the need for India to be part of the global developments.<br><br>Â“The world-wide electroceramics market is expected to be worth US $11bn by Â’07. Even a small part of this market is a huge amount,Â” he said, urging participants at the seminar to develop capabilities in this field.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Being a enthusiast of ur IA, yet you show no clue of the in-depth of your army. When was Hawk advanced jet trainer commissioned? In 2003 as you said? Actually, the article I posted is last July news, see the link below:<br><br><strong><a href="http://www.hinduonnet.com/fline/fl2215/stories/20050729000707700.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.hinduonnet.com/fline/fl2215/stories/20050729000707700.htm </a></strong><br><br>For me, IÂ’d like to read sth concerns more on facts, raw datas than sth beautiful in words, promising in claim but without basic checking on reality or intentionally  avoid it. Only a youngst or somebody with a propaganda in mind like to quote such articles as their source.<br><br>Ppl donÂ’t respond to your post too often doesnÂ’t mean ppl donÂ’t know your flaws of what u like to claim, thatÂ’s just the way ppl show their way of courtesy, and I think you should show some humility as well.<br></div>

There were reports that the kits and parts have arrived in HAL and they will start assembling the Planes and the first batch of them will be handed over to the IAF in the year 2007 onwards.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>From Jane's<br>Quote:<br>Indian SAM decision may influence other procurements<br><br>David C Isby<br><br>India's long-standing competition to select a new low-altitude system to replace the Soviet-designed S-125 (SA-3 'Goa') in the reorganised Western Air Command Area is considered one of the most significant in Asia, writes David C Isby. The value of the contract for 12 truck-mobile batteries is reported in the Indian press as INR1,500 crore (USD340 million).<br><br>While a number of other systems have been considered, the Israeli-designed Rafael-IAI Spyder MR system (using Python 5 and Derby air-to-air missiles) and the MBDA MICA vertical-launch system (VLS) are reported to have been short-listed since 2005. Both competitors have existing strong co-operative ties with Indian missile programmes. The Israelis are working with India on improved versions of the Barak naval SAM while MBDA has built a close relationship with India's Bharat Systems on a number of programmes.<br><br>The winner is expected to be announced in May or June, and the successful bidder will have a potential advantage in the upcoming Singapore competition to identify a replacement for both its IHAWK and Rapier Blindfire within the next few years. Singapore is also likely to be looking for a replacement for its RBS-70 surface-to-air missiles (SAMs).<br><br>While a formal procurement process has not yet started, Singapore is already being strongly marketed with a range of international competitors offering both single-system and integrated solutions. In addition to the competitors for the Indian procurement, a land-based version of the Eurosam ASTER SAMs already ordered for the Singapore Navy is believed to be under consideration. Singapore is also believed to have been offered new short-range missile systems (most notably from Russia) and a number of overhaul and upgrade packages for the RBS-70.<br><br>Malaysia and Pakistan also have long-standing requirements for medium SAMs that are likely to be filled in the near future. While both countries are being targeted by many producers, current thinking is that Malaysia is likely to select a Russian-designed system and Pakistan a Chinese-designed one. Other major land-based SAM programmes in Asia include the Republic of Korea's indigenous development of the M-SAM (Medium SAM), which is intended to replace the IHAWK, and procurement of the SAM-X (intended to replace the Nike-Hercules), and Japan's procurement of the PAC-3.</div>
