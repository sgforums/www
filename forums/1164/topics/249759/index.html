Just the threat of deploying them may make hostile nations see sense.Â”<br><br>A top Naval source said: Â“This means Britain will remain a significant military power.Â”<br><br>It is thought the decision was made after criticism of the Government over its plans to mothball Navy frigates and destroyers.<br><br>The ships will be built by a consortium of BAe Systems and VT Group which have yards on the Clyde and at Portsmouth.<br><br>They will have a Â“ski-jumpÂ” and a Â“catapultÂ” for launching planes. Aircraft will be able to land vertically after missions.<br><br>Former Navy officer Mike Critchley, of Warship World magazine, said of the vessels: Â“They put the Navy back in the First Division.Â”<br><br>j.kay@the-sun.co.uk<br><br>t.newtondunn@the-sun.co.uk </blockquote><img src="http://www.naval-technology.com/projects/cvf/images/CVF_20s.jpg"><br><br>2.<strong><a href="http://jczs.news.sina.com.cn/p/2007-04-21/1605440884.html" rel="nofollow">more images here</a></strong><br><br>3.<strong><a href="http://www.naval-technology.com/projects/cvf/" rel="nofollow">CVF - Royal Navy Future Aircraft Carrier, United Kingdom</a></strong></div>
