            <div class='col-md body'>By Duncan Lennox, Editor of Jane's Strategic Weapon Systems<br><br>The Patriot surface-to-air missile (SAM) systems deployed to the Gulf in January and February this year were in the media spotlight, particularly due to the controversies associated with the Patriot's performance in 1991. It is too soon to know the precise results from the engagements during the recent war in Iraq, but sufficient information has been made available to describe in outline what happened.<br><br>According to media reports, Iraq launched around 18 missiles at the coalition forces between 20 March 20 and 4 April. The US Army states that 13 of these were short-range ballistic missiles (SRBMs) or large surface-to-surface unguided rockets. The remaining five were probably cruise missiles. Of the 13 ballistic missiles and rockets launched, nine were successfully intercepted by a mix of older Patriot Advanced Capability 2 (PAC-2) missiles, including the PAC-2 Guidance Enhanced Missile (GEM) and Guidance Enhanced Missile Plus (GEM+) derivatives, and newer PAC-3 missiles. Of the remaining Iraqi missiles, three were not intercepted, since they were going towards empty desert or the sea, and one exploded at launch. It is believed that the majority of these Iraqi missiles were Ababil-100 (or Al Fatah) and Al Samoud 1/2 ballistic missiles fired at ranges of between 100 and 150km.<br><br>Tragically, two allied aircraft were destroyed by Patriot missiles during the conflict: a UK Tornado GR Mk 4 and a US F/A-18 Hornet. In addition, a USAF F-16 aircraft was locked onto by a Patriot radar, but the aircraft (reportedly assuming it was being targeted by an Iraqi SAM battery) responded by firing an AGM-88 HARM anti-radar missile at the radar, destroying the antenna. The results of detailed investigations are not available, but some comparisons can be drawn. The ballistic missile and rocket targets were travelling much faster than any aircraft and had trajectories outside the atmosphere. The cruise missile targets were similar to small aircraft and were flying at a similar speed to manned aircraft. Allied aircraft were fitted with an Identification Friend or Foe (IFF) system, which should have identified them as friendly aircraft, and the aircraft would presumably have been allocated safe lanes to return down from their missions. Patriot systems can operate in automatic (software-controlled) or manual (human operator-controlled) modes. The detailed investigations will have to examine all the tape recordings and establish what did or did not work, including the possibilities of human error, hardware or software faults and, of course, the general 'fog of war'.<br><br><a href="http://www.janes.com/regional_news/africa_middle_east/news/jdw/jdw030502_1_n.shtml" rel="nofollow">http://www.janes.com/regional_news/africa_middle_east/news/jdw/jdw030502_1_n.shtml</a></div>

It is a good plateform as a middle-defense line agaisnt the SU-30 which are up there trying to snatch our air superiority.<br><br>For our current anti missile capacity , we have the I-hawks which had been reported to have a limited anti-ballastic missile capacity , the Rapier can be use to engage sub-sonic cruisemisile , glide-bombs and UAVs.</div>
