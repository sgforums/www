            <div class='col-md body'><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_idea.gif" alt="Idea" title="Idea"> <strong><span class="large">Diary of a Chao RecruitÂ’s 7 days field camp in Tekong<br><br>Day 5<br>270803 Wednesday (Rainy)</span></strong><br><br>I woke up in the morning and found out we were somewhere near the Tekong Reservoir.<br><br>This morning we learnt 3 new drills: Sniper drill, Artillery drill and hostile aircraft drill. These drills were rather short so platoon sergeants made us practise our FCO drills again as he felt that we did not do as well as what he wanted yesterday.<br><br>Next up is a lecture on section movement. But it started raining cats and dogs halfway through the lecture. The lesson was cancelled and we head back to our harbor area. The rain today was the worst since the start of field camp. Our harbor area was socking wet and muddy. Seeing how things are already going so badly and the morale was at an all time low again, many of us took off our uniforms and began bathing in the rain. We were laughing and enjoying ourselves in the rain. It felt great since we have not bathe with water and soap for a long time. Come to think of it, this was also the first time in field camp that we were actually having some fun.<br><br>When the rain finally stopped, the lecture resumed. After the lesson we were given some time to rest. We made our way to the Tekong reservoir and sat at the banks enjoying the scenic view of the surrounding area, especially the lake, which seems to calm me down and I forget about all my worries for a time being. I cannot believe it but this was also the first time I took off my boots. Boy was I glad I was finally given a chance to dry my feet. Due to the rain these past few days, my socks and boots were soaking wet and you should take a look at the soles of my feet. They are so wrinkled I was having difficulties walking.<br><br>Later that afternoon, we were taught trench digging. We were shown a fire trench and a sleeping trench, which the instructors dug earlier. All of us were required to build our own sleeping trench and a fire trench for our own section tonight.<br><br>Later that night, we started work on trench digging. It sure is tiring work as we dug with SBO, helmet and rifle on. Can you imagine how heavy all that weights felt on us? I drenched myself from head to toes in my own sweats. We were only allowed to use candles as our only source of light, flashlights were not allowed. The candles burnt out pretty fast, most of the time, we were digging in total darkness.<br><br>My uniform felt heavy, but I still have to carry on because we have to finish digging by tonight or else we will have no place to sleep in. Not forgetting we still have to dig the fire trench big enough to accommodate 2 persons up to shoulder level. Before we knew it, it was already 1am plus in the morning. I was feeling very sleeping but the fire trench was still nowhere near finishing. Fortunately, orders were finally given for us to stop digging and we were allowed to sleep. I wasnÂ’t so enthusiastic about sleeping in the muddy trench (we were not allowed to put out our ground sheet over the trench) but that was the least of my worries at that point of time. I was so drowsy I lied down and slept like a baby. Zzz.<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="Arrow" title="Arrow"> <strong>To be continued...</strong></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by CenturionMBT:</div><div class="quote_body"> http://www.boeing.com/defense-space/military/f4/pardopush.htm<br><br>Pardo's Push<br>It was March 10, 1967, in enemy skies over Hanoi. The last of 44 F-4 aircraft were just coming off a bombing raid into North Vietnam when Capt. Bob Pardo and his wingman Capt. Earl Aman were both hit by enemy fire. Aman's aircraft was the worse off. Hit by two damaging blows to the fuel tank, he suddenly was down to 2,000 pounds of fuel instead of the 7,000 pounds he needed to safely return to the refueling tanker.<br><br>Pardo knew he had to do something quickly if Aman was going to make it out. First, he tried to use Aman's drag chute to help the wounded Phantom. With the drag chute extended, Pardo tried to maneuver behind Aman's aircraft so he could use the drag chute compartment to push the aircraft toward the tanker. No good. Turbulence was too great.<br><br>Pardo decided to try to use the tailhook on Aman's aircraft. He moved in under Aman's aircraft and got the tailhook against the windscreen of his F-4 Phantom. Success. By this time, Aman's aircraft was so low on fuel that Pardo told him to shut down the engines. Pardo's push was working, but the two aircraft had to stay directly in line with one another. Pardo would push for 15 to 20 seconds, lose the necessary balance and slide off to the side. Then he'd have to reposition and push again. By now the pressure of Aman's F-4 aircraft was cracking the windscreen of Pardo's fighter. As the spider web of cracks grew, Pardo became increasingly concerned. He moved the hook down the windscreen into a small metal area below. The hook stayed put, and the push continued. To keep his own damaged Phantom flying, Pardo shut down one engine for the last 10 minutes of the flight.<br><br>After pushing Aman's aircraft almost 88 miles, the two damaged Phantoms reached friendly air space. At 6,000 feet, with practically no fuel left, the two pilots and their weapons systems officers parachuted to safety.<br><br>"That was one hell of an airplane," retired U.S. Air Force Lt. Col. Bob Pardo recalled later. "For one aircraft to get two airplanes that far out of Vietnam speaks very well of the people who put it together." </div></blockquote>A bit more detail for you guys, the USAF pronounced this act as inadvisable, though Pardo was awarded a medal. The damaged F-4 that needed help could actually fly on its own, but it lacked fuel, so Pardo pushed it with the starboard engine at full-thrust, and the other F-4 shut-down the engines to reduce turbulence. The aircraft made it to Thailand, if I am not mistaken, where all 4 crew ejected. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Here's 2 stories on request of CeturionMBT.<br><br>1. Peter Sijan, F-4, in Nov 9 1967 was shot down over N Viet. His pilot was never seen again. Sijan was badly injured in the ejection, with frac shull, leg and arm. He reached the ground and in utter agony, managed to crawl through thick brush for 3 weeks evading Viet Congs at the same time. An A-1E was shot down searching for him. He was eventually caught by the Viet Congs. But amazingly, despite his weak condition, he overpowered the guard and escaped or a few hrs. Unfortunately, he was recaptured, and was brutally tortured for that. Despite the best efforts by fellow POWs, Capt Peter Sijan died of pneumonia 3 months later. He was posthumously awarded for his spirit.<br><br>2. Michael Blassie was shot down at An Loc on 1972 May, he was never seen again. His wingman reported that the A-37 was streaming smoke and fuel, and winged over and crashed. There was no response to the wingman calling for him to eject. Years later, The N Viet repatriated 6 bones reportedly from a crash site to USA as a gesture of "good will", along with them came a parachute, a life-raft and amazingly, a name tag saying "Michael Blassie". The USA decided to use the 6 bones to represent the unknown dead in Viet as they had no way of identifying the bones then. The bones were given ceremonial burial,sealed in the mausoleum, along with selected WWI and WWII dead that had been unidentified. In 1990s, DNA identification sparked interest in the bones again, and Clinton opened up the mausoleum and the bones were proven to be that of M Blassie, the bones were reburied in Airlington National Airforce.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_idea.gif" alt="Idea" title="Idea"> <strong><span class="large">Diary of a Chao RecruitÂ’s 7 days field camp in Tekong </span><br><br>Day 7<br>240803 Friday (sunny)</strong><br><br>We were once again Â“attackedÂ” by the commanders in the early morning. As usual things were happening so quickly most of us did not have the time to pack. I gathered all my equipments and simply throw all of them into my field pack and fall in with the rest of the company. As expected, many of my friends left behind some of their things because of the urgency. One even left his helmet behind! Ground sheets, ET blades were among the many things left behind too. Scolding followed, as usual.<br><br>With the morning chaos finally back to normal, and after a round of Â“make upÂ” session, we were ready for our final march back to civilization! The march started off with an imaginary artillery attack. Everyone ran, with the constant threats of casualties from the sergeants if we do not run fast enough. No one wanted that to happen of course, if the sergeant were to appoint one of us as casualty, the rest of us would have to carry him. So we ran as fast as we humanly can, not easy considering all those heavy things we are carrying on our back.<br><br>After a short rest, we continued our march. It was a long march, I do not even know where we are heading? But at least it was something different today, because for the past few days we have been marching in the night in total darkness, I finally get the chance to see the jungle of Tekong in daylight.<br><br>I lost track of time, but it was a welcoming sight when we finally see buildings ahead of us. We have reached SISPEC and will be going for our finally event, the BIC. We were briefed on what is going to happen by a warrant officer form SISPEC. Turns out we must crawl backwards on our back with our riffle at the front through bare wires and threw a grenade. It was an exhausting crawl with GPMG rounds shooting above us.<br><br>Recruits from other companies were there too. Found out that they will be returning to company line in toners while our company, been the garang company that we always are, will be marching back without any transportation.<br><br>Everyone was in high spirits, the field camp is finally over and we finally will be able to book out later in the afternoon. I couldnÂ’t describe my feelings I finally reached company line. I looked at the ground and thought to myself, Â“IÂ’m finally standing on concrete floor, no more mud and sand. I was overjoyed!<br><br>Our bunk and the corridors was a mess after we step through it, with sand and all our dirty equipments everywhere. Everybody was rushing to the shower rooms, the other were busy finding food to eat. Me? I switched on my handphone and see just many messages I got during my absence. It was a funny sight to see everyone dressed in admin attire for lunch, since all of us were so used to seeing everyone in dirty muddy no.4 for the past 7 days.<br><br>Everything was still in rush even though we are back. ThatÂ’s avoidable since we must get everything done if we were to book out in the afternoon. Needless to say, nobody wants to slow things down and delay our booking out. We spent the most amount of time on cleaning the riffle, followed by area cleaning and packing our stuffs for book out. We were allowed to pack our stuffs in our duffle bag, since we have so many dirty uniforms to wash including our field pack and SBO too.<br><br>It was the first long weekend for all of us. I canÂ’t wait to get home and rest on my comfy bed. But first I will be getting myself a hearty fast food meal at white sand shopping centre, after all, 7 days of combat ration have really make me crave for some quality yummy food.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br><br><strong><span class="large">The End</span></strong></div>
