            <div class='col-md body'>In Vietnam, Australian troops had their own idea of counter-insurgency warfare compared to US.<br><br>Aussies practiced their doctrine of counter insurgency warfare in which pacification of villages and denial of access of these villages to VC was of primary importance.<br><br>They set up ambushes around pacified villages and had great success killing VC as they come in at night to collect food, taxes, recruits and generally to intimidate the villagers into supporting them, creating a shadow government.<br><br>Australian ambushes effectively strangled this supply of food to the point that the VC division in their area was near starvation.<br><br>This caused some VC to surrender and provide useful intel, and the rest to spend more time on the problem of feeding themselves. And in being hungry, they also became desperate and careless.<br><br>But top US brass running ordered the Australians to abandon this pacification program and fight like the Americans. This means chasing the enemy in the jungles in the hammer and anvil strategy the US thought so highly of.<br><br>And producing body count was considered the only tangible results of winning the war.<br><br>So the Australians abandoned their pacification program and went hunting, The defense of the villages were left to poorly-armed and motivated local paramilitary units whose loyalty were questionable sometimes.<br><br>So, as many VC dead as the hammer and anvil could create, these casualties were quickly replaced as the VC again had uninterrupted supply of food, medicine and recruits from the villages. The VC were also supplied from the North, but these were mainly weapons and ammo. Food and money, they got from the villages.<br><br>This is typical American unthinking cowboy mentality. We would do well to stay well away from. This Australian account is not just a small footnote - the US lost the war in Vietnam to a very bare bones army because of their lack of flexibility, poor understanding of the situation and mainly - arrogance.<br><br>The point is: Would over emphasis on military ties with US lead us to think and act like them or would it, hopefully, teach us to do the exact opposite?</div>

But this depends on our judgement to take the initiative to strike first.<br><br>So what we are left to face will likely be a very conventional i.e. low tech land warfare.<br><br>Malaysians are currently concentrating on building airborne RDF battalions so it seems their strategy to counter our "Forward Defense" doctrine is to surprise attack first and land paratroops in our rear while their other forces mass for a frontal attack across the causeways. They will supplement these attacks with other "coastal hooks" which can come from the east, west or the south. Their goal will be to deny us any chance of a effective "Forward Defense" strategy by bringing the fight to our island. We can occupy as much of their forests as we want but they're gonna attack our city. Hence their employment of MLRS.<br><br>I think that us being a conscript army is not too big a problem. Another point is that the most effective units are not necessarily the NSF units. The reservist units are more experienced and also more mature and have a lot more to fight for. Israel's army is mostly conscripts also, as were many victorious armies during wars. So this is not a major problem.<br><br>For me, I think inexperience, over-reliance on technology and firepower, and under-estimation of our potential enemies' fighting prowess will cause a lot of problems.<br><br>We use words like "stupid" to describe our potential enemies. If you don't believe me there is one topic on this forum with a title of "stupid Malaysian Naval project". Many of us seem to think our potential enemies are always fcuking up or sitting around twiddling their thumbs while we talk loudly of "Forward Defense" or what super-duper combat ship or aircraft we will buy...<br><br>America was 100 times more advanced and well-armed than their enemies in Korea and Vietnam yet the enemy found ways to negate these advantages.<br><br>And our small size means that we can't even afford to lose one battle.<br><br>I think SAF has yet to develop an effective counter against the Malaysian's very low-tech MLRS. These will be used more as terror weapons to hit our city than as a military weapon. They can hide easily and fire salvoes at our airbases and- say Ang Mo Kio. We can only detect the launchers after they have fired their ordnance and we have no effective ways of completely destroying these rockets once they're airborne.<br><br>Another problem I sense is the lack of real killer aggression in our soldiers. In China where I now live people whom have served in the PLA say that the PLA still believes that you can only get tough and aggressive soldiers by using frequent beatings during training. The stick carried by their equivalent of CSMs and officers is actually used to strike soldiers when they fcuk up.<br><br>You may laugh or it sounds babaric but this is the tactic many armies like those of Japan during WW2, Russia, Korea and many specops use to produce killer instincts in soldiers.<br><br>During the time I served the instructors still pushed, dragged or kicked recruits in the backside and used very vulgar languages. Apparently now instructors can't use vulgar language and can only make a recruit do a limited number of push ups a day.<br><br>And SAF has decided we don't need bayonets anymore as evidenced by the SAR-21.<br><br>Wow...<br></div></blockquote>Their C-130 carrying their paratroopers , would be heavily marked , from what i know ,our air-defense system is much more advanced then what you see.<br>I don't think they will risk their paratroopers , just imagine 1 missile heading for it could cost it many lives.It's impossible for tanks to simply move through the causeway , so many people will notice it lahs.<br><br>just blow up the causeway and you get stranded tanks.<br>If im correct,  we got a swedish radar which can detect MLRS<br><br>In the future , you will be seeing Unmanned boats equipped with RPG/machine guns patrolling the singapore straits someday.<br><br>Malaysian naval ships , no doubt , are very advanced as well , but without the main technical know-how , because the Americans and Europeans are always known to withhold certain form of key technologies from the countries they sell the weapons to.<br><br>Unlike Singapore , in which it gains first hand experience in building naval ships , thats where you can know what kind of platforms you need , what kind of key technologies which you are lacking in etc..<br><br>Thats the critical differences , just like in real life , people don't sell you the best thing they got , they only sell you the 2nd best , cause they want to remain superior.<br><br>i will be the 1st to laugh if they hit our runways though.<br>Anyway , its so tough , even if they get the bunker busting bomb , i don't think they can destroy the H.A.S<br><br>The only problem facing us is jungle-warfare<br></div>

I am not saying they will definitely succeed but then you cannot discount that they won't. In war nothing is predictable.<br><br>Who could've predicted that Israel would nearly wipe out the combined Egyptian, Jordanian and Syrian armies in only six days in 1967? And then after that Egypt rebuilt her forces to successfully cross the river in force to catch Israel by surprise? Or that highly-trained US SpecOps had to be rescued by Malaysian troops in Somalia? Or that illiterate Mujahideen outfought the mighty USSR army? etc etc.... The only lesson here is: Nothing is Impossible. This applies to us as well as "them" - whomever they are.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>perhaps a better comparison between a MRLS system vs an ARTY system would be based on cost... assuming that firepower per rocket is equivalent or nearly equal that of an arty shell...<br><br>the reason why i use 30 minutes was based on my assumption that a rocket MRLS system would take around that long to reload... not really because i think its a good idea for arty to stay in one place for 30 minutes.<br><br>however, if we go right down to the devils of the details... the conclusion would still be the same... that is.. buck for buck.. arty gives a far bigger bang vs MRLS.<br><br>that is all i intended to say....</div>

How that impacts and affects the overall effectiveness of our military is something quite unique to us as I am not sure if that is the way other armies promote their officers thru the ranks (i.e. Scholars etc.).
