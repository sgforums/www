These will be used more as terror weapons to hit our city than as a military weapon. They can hide easily and fire salvoes at our airbases and- say Ang Mo Kio. We can only detect the launchers after they have fired their ordnance and we have no effective ways of completely destroying these rockets once they're airborne.<br><br>Another problem I sense is the lack of real killer aggression in our soldiers. In China where I now live people whom have served in the PLA say that the PLA still believes that you can only get tough and aggressive soldiers by using frequent beatings during training. The stick carried by their equivalent of CSMs and officers is actually used to strike soldiers when they fcuk up.<br><br>You may laugh or it sounds babaric but this is the tactic many armies like<br>And SAF has decided we don't need bayonets anymore as evidenced by the SAR-21.<br></div></blockquote>I think it is very unfair to say that SAF did not develop an effective counter against low-tech MLRS...  yes they may fire the first salvo.... so what it hit a few blocks of flats .... please don't over estimate the power of hit. This is not movies show which everyone have unlimited supplies and keep firing.<br><br>Remember there is weakness in MlRS too. They need relatively open ground. Also with artilliary tracking radar, where they fire from is can be calculated, thus before the 1st MLRS round landed, SAF already have the firing solution and our own artilleries already return fire back.  Yep you may say that the MLRS fire and move away, but don't forget we fire back area target also ! how many will be successful to get away ? If there is MLRS surviving, the planes will on sites to take out the rest with helicopters behind to hunt down the rest.<br><br>Also by then their supplies is cut off, with no fuel and ammo. You think the the MLRS can do much ?<br><br>You must ask also, can the other side also stop our howister rounds ? They also have no way to stop the rounds once we fired. You may argue yep their rocket bigger !!! But rocket big because most part of it is to carry fuel to propellel it . They fire one rocket ! We fire 3 rounds to make up the size then same same....  then compare rates right .... sorry man howister reload faster lah !!! haha...<br><br>Also what make you think Singapore is not into mulitple rocket launcher ? With every thing we running ahead ? you think we left out something so important ?<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote>Mighty and firepower do not EQUATE victory... but lack of might will invite war...</blockquote>Did I propose we "reduce" our firepower?<br><br><blockquote>all weapons are terror weapon...range of weapon is not everything, whats the point of being able to shoot beyond the moon but miss the moon by a billion miles?</blockquote>You are restating my very same points.<br><br><blockquote>that is stereotypical thinking... (about Americans) in war, there is no such thing as acting stupid and still win a war.... only that on hindsight.. people would always question about the "possibilities" of alternatives....</blockquote>All I can say is read up on books on American combat performance post WW2. Of course, you should read books that offer a more objective POV. US is better at packaging its propaganda better than anyone else so ...<br><br><blockquote>that would not be a fair assessment in my opinion, it belittles not only the USMC, but their opponents as well.... in my opinion, both sides give their best, but ultimately, there has to be a winner in any competition... but that does not automatcally implies that the looser is a bunch of cockups.</blockquote>That was a joke offered in a half-hearrted defense of our own beleagued Guards unit. The word "cockup" I was quoting someone else. So you can stand down.<br><br><blockquote>wrong... the overall combat capabilities of a unit is not merely measured by the number of push-ups each soldier can do... but rather the complete overall aspect of the unit including trainning, leadership and without a doubt... in the heralding modern age, the importance of technology and equipment cannot be understated and could very well prove to be the key determinants in any outcome.</blockquote>Again, where did I say it is not important to be well-armed and equipped with the latest technology.<br><br><blockquote>on hindsight... there will also be 1001 better ways, but then non of the 1001 ways guarantees anything nor victory as the enemy would also have 1001 ways to counter your 1001 better moves. </blockquote>The quote from this historian is saying that the Americans don't seem to learn from past mistakes. We are not talking about hindsight versus... etc.<br><br><blockquote>there is nothing wrong in holding americans in high regards... they fought and they won against adverseries that most other nation would not dare challenge.</blockquote>And against whom did the Americans achieve victories that other nations dare not challenge?</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>There is nothing to suggest that the quality of american troops is below average, if anything, they are probably one of the finest soldiers around. Individually and on the tatical level, they can more then hold their own.<br><br>The only problem is that it seems that they don't know what to do with all this quality, judging from the way they are deployed. The SAF has a wide diet of armed forces that it learns from, and now, moving onto the 3G force, it is forging its own path to tailor to its own needs... I'm just interested to see where all this leads.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>On the subject of military exercises - I've been involved on a number of exercises where my company or battalion (depending on the scale of the exercises) played the enemy troops. In most execises, we are told, ultimately, to let the larger, friendly forces, overrun us. Even if we played hard - we still let them win. People who have been involved in these exercises should know this better, and understand the circumstances and objectives of the exercise play, rather than to listen to "tales".<br><br>I've been on exercise with the US Marines - my company played enemy - going against a force of US Marine battalion plus, supported by their amphibious APC, plus the rest of my battalion (the remaining 2 companies plus the support company). Of course they will overrun us.<br><br>Same thing during BTEC - my company played enemy against one infantry battalion - we defend, then let them overrun us, as according to the needs of the exercise. Results - Infantymen going around with tales of how they beat a Guards unit.<br><br>But of course - my company have gone successfully against other larger forces. That is a different story.</div>
