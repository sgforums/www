Were they impressed? Hardly. Apparently, during tactical movement through the jungles, a shot was fired. Thai troops all hit the ground.

            <div class='col-md body'>In my opinion our weaknesses is:<br>- We have "text-book" generals-(look at the CDF..fat bugger...I belief he cannot even finish his 2.4km in 15mins!).<br>-Increase the service period from 2yrs to the old 2.5 or even 3yrs to ensure 100% understanding of the officer,specialists and men's tasks and job scope.<br>-Attach regulars and possibility of NSFs to real world ops.<br>-Be more transparent in findings of deaths caused by training accidents.This will ensure public faith in the SAF.Cover-ups only stain the good name of the organization.<br>-Run the SAF as a military organization,not as a goddamned CORPORATION!!!This is the biggest turn off for me manz..look at the OCS website...OCS Corporation.This is an army not a friggin mercenary!<br>-Lower reliance of technology..look at how the VietCong and NVA beat the US mighty technological superiority with the bare essentials.<br>-Increase troop survivability equipment like body armour,ballistic shields etc.(they look real impressive and are useful for FIBUA.Saw the one SAF is using.Will say that it will save alot of lives in combat)<br><br>Thats my 2 cents worth.<br></div>
