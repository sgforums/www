Its like blaming the doctors and ambulances for not appearing before your eyes when you suddenly meet with an accident on the streets(Personally, I'd find that creepy. Its as if they anticipated my accident).<br><br>Furthermore, if everyone acted on their own initiative, I think the outcome would have been more chaos instead of order.

However back to the Topic of our "Mindef" Leadership, Risk taking evaluations and participation in local "High risk situations", I do understand one thing. People who have too much to lose have less regard for risk taking.  So my point is they are too comfortable siting in their seats to stand up to walk to the real situations.<br><br>For TVDog who thinks MEDIC is not a combat vocation, you're very wrong.  Combat-medics carry heavier equipment than your soldiers. We're required to maintain our health as we're expected to be the last person to be reporting sick. We have to evaluate for officers whether a combat soldier is "Keng" or really needs attention. We need to face "Combat Stressed" Soldiers.<br><br>We carry needle scars from every year of Vocational training. When was your last visible scar from NS? We're either no situation to see or a real live injury to attend to. When was the last time you have to perform live situations?<br><br>From this many points and as a Combat Medic, I personally salute our SCDF nsf's for their commitment to service and live-situations.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>One thing I want to emphasize is the Mentality of our "Higher Ranking Soldiers".<br><br>If a soldier is getting too comfortable being paid peanuts and dares not take up activities because there is too much to risk? For example, now there are certain courses considered taboo to even talk about , since the dunking case, there should be an evaluation of what liabilities and treatment of situations. We know for sure we're not going to be very realistic in many risk involved trainings. In any operation, "Safety" should be the priority for our Singaporean Sons.<br><br>However, as far as domestic situations occur please do have a realistic approach. We have many elite soldiers who have been placed in risky ops before, they have handled killings. And my salutes.<br><br>There are many other opportunities to be taken. Training for war is not all about weapons. Its the greatest weakness to think that weapons can win the war. Logistics , resource handling, communications are just as, if not more important. The weakness is the in Minds of all our soldiers .  Taking things too comfortably.<br><br></div>

Where did those people who collected $$$ come into the picture, take the risks ??? More than surprising they paid others dusts just to risk others. Why they quarantined that many people ?? They were so serious about paying people's loss of income ?? What about those putting themselves at risk ? What about those who were risked suffered 1st hand the disease and volunteered to be their guinea pigs ? You can name many unsung heroes But those who died for it never received peanuts as bonuses less to say conpensations.</div>
