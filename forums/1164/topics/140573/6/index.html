The PLA is a pretty impressive force to be reckoned with, let's not be ignorant about this. Can they deploy all their forces and ensure morale? You bet.<br><br>Morale in the armed forces is extremely high and this is not propaganda. The company I work for hires quite a few ex-servicemen including one SWAT guy as bodyguards/drivers. Most of them are very proud to have served like you wouldn't believe. And almost all Chinese people are extremely nationalistic and patriotic to the point of being obsessive.<br><br>The PLA had been feverishly updating its weaponry and tactics since the first Gulf War when they saw what the US was capable of. Their infantry troopers had always been one of the finest in Asia and now they have upgraded their technology to build decent MBTs (in great numbers as usual) and their airforce is also trying to catch up.</div>

I thought this thread is supposed to be "possible weaknesses of SAF"? Why do you have to get defensive on my personal opinion and try to compare to PLA? A weakness is a weakness, doesn't matter how's the condition in other armies. I was just spelling out the impressions I got.<br><br>And did I say that I'm from China, or you just assumed that I'm from China? I'm from M'sia, but yes my ancestors are from China and I'm proud of that.<br><br></div>
