Din sell any guns to myanmmar ... only sold some old tooling equipment used for manufacture. Packed in aluminium foil then shipped out ... other words, we sold them a plant (source janes def)... but I think it's good, give the guys up north something to think abt.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Also, during the 80's when still small small boy, I worked part-time as a production operator during holidays for a well established international company specialised in making NVG.<br><br>During my 6wk stay there, saw 3 arabs with vry distinct iranian accent(I may be wrong), how I know they were arabs? They stared salivery at our chinese women who dun wear tudungs with short skirts like looking at porno pics in playboy magazine.<br><br>They ordered a huge cache of NVG's, night sniper/MG scopes, oversaw the  assembly paid in cash and left.<br><br>The order may have been made overseas but delivery in asia because of sensitivity(western double standards).<br><br>Think the company no longer operate here. They went "global" few years ago with the advice from our good government.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>hey buzz, just a thought here: whatever your anti-riot police shoot, dun make them shoot anything larger 2cm in diameter, else if they miss, which some of them sure will, or whatever they shoot bounces away, the rioters will pick up the objects and throw them back at the police, thats why base balls are a no-no, they'll pick up the baseballs you shoot and throw it back at you<br><br>and abt the 275 AMX-13, read the thread  'Light Tank'</div>
