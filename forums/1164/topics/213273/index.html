            </div>
            <div class='col-md body'>Just wondering which is the better way to assault buildings eg. a skyscrapper etc is it Top Down or Bottom Up?<br><br>Human nature when pursued to in a building is to run upwards.When I was younger, we often played war at my friend's condo and when engaged in running fights on the stairs, we have a tendency to run upwards.But, we all know that the higher up we run, the lesser chance of escape we have as we will eventually run out of place to run right?<br><br>Thus, would is be wiser to assault a building, lets say a 20 floor HDB block, does it make more sense for an assault force of say 40 to 60 shooters to heli-rappel or heli-drop onto the roof and fight their way downwards?Throwing grenades downwards is also easier and the assault force has the momentum to rush downwards as opposed to upwards.And if the defenders decide to pull a fast one, they may rush out of the building, but end up getting shot by the occupying force on top of the building or the remaining assault group may chase them on their helos.<br><br>However, when assaulting upwards, it is tiring for the assault force. And also, the defenders may leave obstacles to block the path of the assault force or make their lives difficult.The virtue being that the defenders may be pursued to run till they run out of places to escape to, and be forced to fight with greater determination as they have lost everything but their lives.<br><br>So if given the situation, with 100 shooters which will you pick? Assaulting top down or bottoms up?</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>So tactically, it will be sound to drop in above and commence assault there, with a blocking force around the target building to prevent anyone from escaping right? But when you are inside the building, in this case a HDB block with many levels, you've gotta factor in that there are many nooks and crannys in the various apartments. So does the assault force like leave a few chaps behind on every floor to guard so that those defenders whom manage to get away will not run back to those levels which have already been cleared?<br><br>Or do they just rush downwards all the way,without leaving trailers behind?</div>

Dominate first and the rest can be worried / improvised later.<br><br>I guess thats the difference between exercise and ops.  I'd think actual ops, they'd have a security force to sweep up after the assault is over, ie. Clear bodies, collect weapons etc..<br><br>Pardon me for askin, wat exactly was ur job again? =D  You seem to have a lot of prior experience in this .</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>The ideal "textbook" situation is always going to be a Top Down attack.<br>The advantages of such an attack are obvious.<br><br>Firstly, grenades roll downwards. Thus, it's easier for you to lob a grenade at the enemy than it is for the enemy to throw one at you.<br><br>Secondly, attacking downwards allows your support weapons to come into play. By attacking downwards, any escaping enemy are "flushed" towards the buildings exits. By siting MG weapons in position to guard the exits, any escaping enemy will be wiped out with no further risk. On the other hand, enemy always escape AWAY from the the direction your attack is coming from so if you attack top-up, you might find that you've chased all the enemy and trapped them in the top floor. This is BAD for the infantryman because a cornered and trapped enemy will more likely put up a more aggressive defence since they have no other alternative than to fight. Clearing this last floor will definitely result in more friendly casualties.<br><br>Lastly, attacking top-down will allow a force to side-step more enemy obstacles and traps since these are more likely to be placed at exits and entrances.</div>

However, if multi-level, I pity the shagged assault force once they reach the top.</div>
