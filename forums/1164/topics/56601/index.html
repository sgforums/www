            <div class='col-md body'>I have recently come across a new version of light tank  from the US in the Tom Clancy book titled "Armoured Warfare". However, the book is a bit old so the info may be a bit out-dated. He talk about the experimental XM8 Armoured Gun System by FMC. The XM8 has an aluminium hull and turret, and is armed with a soft-recoil 105mm gun, which can fired the same ammunition as the early versions of the M1 Abrams.  It have an autoloader adapted from the US Navy's 5" Mk-45 gun mount to handle and load the shells in the AGS. It will be capable of loadind a fresh round every 5 seconds, and should be quite reliable,based on the history of the naval gun mount and initial tests. Because of the autoloader the crew is being reduced from 4 to 3. It is powered by a 550-hp diesel enginewith a hydromechanical automatic transmission. XM8 will be capable of speeds up to 45mph/74kph, depending on the terrain and the installed armour package. What do you guys think? Sounds pretty good to me! <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"></div>

Is it canned?<br><br>Actually on a singapore context better to get a 105mm-guned BX than to pursue this.<br><br>Actually I rather doubt the ability of the 105mm gun to defeat Modern MBTs such as the improved Polish T-72s.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I think you mean our version of the M109 SPH. Basically, it is a M109 chassis mounting a new turret with a version of the FH88/2000 gun. Saw this back in Sungei Gedong trg. area back in Feb 2001 during my ICT. Can't remember whether it is 39 or 52 caliber though. Wonder when they will unveil this to the public...</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>The XM8 is very old news and has indeed been canned.<br>Cost were too high for a tank that was not going to deliver.<br>The tank's amour was suppose to be modulated.With mod 1 being a super striped down version of some 20tons i think.It would have been soft skinned and suvive ammo of up to 7.62 caliber ffrom the front.Baically anything bigger then an AK-47 could kill it.In mod 2 it weights 24 tons i think.It will be able to suvive  up till 20mm on the front.Mod 3 would be able to handle up a recoil anti tank gun 30mm i think not too sure about this.<br>With the mod 1 you can fit 8 into the hull of a C-5...with Mod 2...6 and mod 3 will have 4 into the hull.All this includes all supporting gear.<br>With Anti-tank weapons becoming more powerful the US saw that the tank was obsolete and canned the project as a mere RPG-7 could penetrate.<br><br>http://www.fas.org/man/dod-101/sys/land/m8-ags.htm</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Aiyoh, you anyhow wack your info one. The canning of the XM-8 AGS is prehaps one of the stupidest moves US Armed Forces red tape can come up with. No, the AGS is not an obsolute or flawed design. And by any measure it is actually the among most advanced light tanks ever developed. The reason it was canned was not because of cost overruns or any flaws on its part (which were well within limits compared to other sexier, but much less needed weapons programs). But criminally bad planning.<br><br>Your idea on AGS protection demostrates your heavy lack of understanding of the actual capabilities of this system. On level one protection, it can protect the crew from all kinds of small arms fire and limited exposive devices. It can certainly survive small arms larger then an AK-47, and most certainly protect from soviet 14.7mm heavy machine guns.<br><br>What's more the level of protection rises dramatically when the modular armor packages are installed. On level 3 armour, the AGS actually packs more survivability then a M60 Patton tank. It can certainly survive an RPG on level 3.<br><br>And project cost overruns are insane. If anything, the AGS was a dirt cheap program. The very tank itself used mainly off the shelf parts and even the same powerpack as their 5 tonner truck.<br><br>And your idea of the AGS role seems to be badly flawed as well. It is not supposed to fight MBTs, but rather, provide high mobile, deployable supporting armoured firepower to rapid deployment units. With the canning of the AGS and retirement of the Sheridan, US airborne troops are left without any kind of heavy firepower on their own. Unless you have any idea of getting 70 ton Abrams tanks halfway across the world overnight and use it with full fuel and ammo, you can see why the AGS was so useful, and it's canning unjustified.<br><br>If anything, scrapping the AGS program in the defence budget buys the US armed forces, 15 heavily invested in, overly expensive (and not really needed) Super Hornets for the marines (which they would likely end up crashing anyway). The same amount of cash which can buy over 50 XM-8 tanks providing rapid deployment units with their much needed firepower.</div>
