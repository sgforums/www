            <div class='col-md body'>SUBMARINES: Aussie Collins-class Sub Â“SinksÂ” US Boat<br><br>December 13, 2003:  Someone passing the Pentagon during the end of September would have noticed the lights burning brightly all night at the US NavyÂ’s Submarine Directorate. An Australian Type 471 Collins-class diesel-electric submarine had just Â“sunkÂ” an unidentified US Navy submarine (most likely a  Los Angeles-class nuclear attack sub, which the US Navy asserts is superior to any other non-US sub in the world today). The diesel-powered Collins-class is relatively modest, with a submerged displacement of approximately 3,300 tons. The nuclear-powered Los Angeles-class -- designed to sink Soviet submarines during the Cold War -- is far more sophisticated and typically displaces over 6,900 tons submerged.<br><br>In late September HMAS Waller (S-75) had Â“sunk the pride of the US nuclear submarine fleetÂ” with practice torpedoes during an unspecified exercise. HMAS Waller was launched in 2001. The RAN ordered six of these subs from Holland in 1987; the last Â– HMAS Rankin Â– was launched earlier this year. The class was designed by Swedish shipbuilders Kockums.<br><br>The US Navy has declined to identify the sub involved or provide details about the exercise. The unidentified US boat was Â“sunkÂ” with a Mk 48 practice torpedo. Both RAN and USN subs use this weapon. <strong>Also during the exercise, WallerÂ’s sister ship, HMAS Rankin, "sank" an unidentified Singaporean ASW ship.</strong><br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">to read more, visit </span><a href="http://www.strategypage.com/fyeo/howtomakewar/default.asp?target=htsub.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.strategypage.com/fyeo/howtomakewar/default.asp?target=htsub.htm</a></div>

Perhaps it's time the rsn request that the indian navy let it fight against more advanced subs in their arsenal than just simply their aging foxtrots, as it has done for a decade already.<br><br>Anyway, kudos to the ozzie sub captains for their cunning and skill.

            <div class='col-md body'>Accidents are part and parcel of the military training and operations. It is regrettable that the SAF has so much accidents in the past year or so, but they have to learn the lessons from all this and move on, hopefully for the better.<br>Even the most established navies experienced such accidents from time to time..., read the USN and RN.<br>For eg, the RN has had accidents with their SSN and frigates either running aground or scrapping their hull. The most famous would be the HMS Nottingham that ran aground off Australia, and has to be piggybacked back to the UK. For the USN, remember USS Greenville, the SSN that rammed the japanese trawler/training vessel, resulting in a loss of lives on board the japanese vessel.<br>The question is did we learn our lessons, and how do we improve? Just like the USN learned from the experience of the horrendous accident of the cruiser USS Belknap resulting from a collision with the  aircraft carrier USS John F Kennedy back in Nov'75.<br>That collision caused more than 15000 gallons of jet fuel being spilled onto the much smaller cruiser, creating a huge fire that melted away the Aluminium superstructure, and high casualties on the ship's crew. Well, the USN learnt the lessons of this tragic accident-the result, use of Aluminium was abandoned with practically the whole ship being made of steel- a good example being the Arleigh Burke class, which one of them, USS Cole, even survived a terrorist attack.<br>Lets hope Mindef learn from all these accidents, as well as those of other countries... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cry.gif" alt="Crying or Very sad" title="Crying or Very sad"><br><br></div>

Re-validate our tactics and organisation.<br><br>Who knows they may learn some lessons to better drive the techies in DSO/DSTA away from Star Wars......<br><br>You know the MAF bought M113s after they lost 13 guys in the Panhard vehicle to a RPG.<br><br>Of course SAF knew that 10 years before! <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"></div>

If he suspect a terror attack, he should have asked for help or, at the least, turn away. Doing a small turn to avoid a terror attack is in his own words "absolutely absurd". I think he lost situation awareness and hump thump an answer.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I'm afraid pointing to technology as SAF's wrong focus is barking up the wrong tree.<br><br>Technology is technology. An AK-47 is technology, so is that makeshift bomb those J.I jokers love to make. Weapons technology in whatever incarnation is technology. The question is however, how much technology, what level, and what context it can be applied to our situtation.<br><br>SAF's drive towards technology is not misfocused, or wrong, if anything, it is a good thing that should be taken to it's logical conclusion, and that is the technological superiority over our potential foe.<br><br>Lest anybody point out that technology failed the americans in Mog. let it be known that a bunch of rangers and delta troopers held off a whole city of militia with air support and superior weaponry. What would have happened to the americans had they no body armour or Little Birds to keep the Somalis at bay? Less body bags? I doubt it. Mog. was not a failure of technology, but a failure of stragetic planning, and command and control. If anything, it was the superior technology the americans had that actually kept the body count on their side so surprisingly low and morbidly high on the Somali side.<br><br>What is the problem here however, is not technology itself, but the true soul and mettle of the men behind the machines. And that is the area SAF needs to work on. That is building up a personnel corps that will be able to make utter and full use of their advanced technology. Yes, we can have land warriors that are equipped with thermal sights, OICW-SAR21s, body armour and battlefield computers, but these same land warriors should be able to rough it out in the field and have the true mettle of a soldier as well.<br><br>The problem is not that we have too much technology, but rather, our people still have some work to do to match up and make optimal use of that technology. Only a fool would look at technology with dislain. Maybe you would still like to fly a Hunter instead of an F-16 today because it was more Old School and thought a pilot how to really fly instead of doing so with those icky FBW computers?<br><br>Technology does not make us wimps, it is a tool for us to use. The SAF is not misaligned in driving for high technology, but rather, lets say that in it's drive for high technology, let it not lose out on the drive for quality troops as well.<br><br>To dump technology in favour of making a more old school army? In Singapore's context? That's insanity. Not unless we're North Korea.<br><br></div>
