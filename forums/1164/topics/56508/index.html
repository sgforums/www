His father has retired from SingTel but his mother still works for the telco.<br><br>He was on hand to explain to Defence Minister Teo Chee Hean the inner workings of the jet, after the minister inaugurated the two-day event.<br><br>Asked about Lt Yusri's appointment, Rear-Admiral (NS) Teo said: 'We need good people in the SAF and we evaluate people on their ability, aptitude, commitment to Singapore and their dedication to the SAF.'<br><br>And does Lt Yusri himself feel additional pressure to perform, being the only Malay fighter pilot in the RSAF?<br><br>He said: 'Pressure? I don't think so. I'm here to do my job, like everybody else.'<br></div>

When? IIRC, maybe before 911? Guess he was still a trainee then.

            <div class='col-md body'>This is an excellent step forward! I hope that the SAF will continue to allow more of our Malay brothers to be in vocations previously thought to be sensitive. I understand the reason behind this arrangement but times are changing and i hope that the big brass will change their policy as well.This will allow them to feel more important and vital to the defence of our country and at the same time prevent racial discrimination within a national institution like the SAF.BTW i am a Chinese. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Kudos to Lt. Yusri for making the grade!! The Malay community is extremely proud of his achievement. I'm sure many of our other young malay brothers who are aspiring to become fighter pilots will look upon him as their idol and role model !<br><br>Rest assured gentlemen, Lt Yusri is the first Malay fighter pilot in the RSAF, and he is certainly not going to be the last.   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"></div>
