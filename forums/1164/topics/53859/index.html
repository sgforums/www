            <div class='col-md body'>MINISTER FOR DEFENCE OBSERVES INTEGRATED SAF EXERCISE<br><br>The new Minister for Defence, Rear-Admiral (RADM) (NS) Teo Chee Hean, observed a Singapore Armed Forces (SAF) exercise on Pulau Sudong today. He was accompanied by Minister of State for Defence, Mr Cedric Foo, Senior Parliamentary Secretary for National Development and Defence, Associate Professor Koo Tsai Kee, Permanent Secretary for Defence, Mr Peter Ho, and the Chief of Defence Force, Major-General Ng Yat Chung.<br><br>Codenamed Vigilance, the exercise featured the recapture of an offshore island which had been taken by an enemy force. The Minister for Defence first watched two commando platoons rappelling from RSAF UH-1H and Super Puma helicopters and landing on Pulau Sudong using Zodiac boats. This was followed by infantry troops, M113 armoured vehicles and Light Strike Vehicles disembarking from waves of RSN fast craft to secure the beachhead. The Army forces then advanced inland to recapture the airstrip from the enemy. At the airstrip, RADM (NS) Teo saw a Chinook helicopter airlifting light artillery to support the operation. Two Super Puma helicopters also delivered additional logistics supplies to the SAF task force while the Chinook evacuated simulated casualties.<br><br>Exercise Vigilance involved regulars, Full-Time National Servicemen and Operationally-Ready NSmen, and demonstrated the SAFÂ’s operational readiness and proficiency in conducting integrated operations.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>cavsg is right that this is the first time theres been official mention of an airstrip in Sudong. However a few years ago CRISP published a satellite photo of Singapore which was reprinted in the Straits Times, and in the bottom corner of the photo, a runway can clearly be seen in Sudong. East-West orientation, relatively short.<br><br>IIRC all the other runways in Singapore were also not edited out from the photo, as was the usual practice.</div>

Something is not right. Surely there's a better way of doing it.

            <div class='col-md body'>U can found a futo on the said 'airstrip' in one the book published mid-80 for the public on SAF's .....anniversary.  It was featured on the the role of the AOCO vocation.   Too bad, i JUST threw that book away to free up the shelves for new addition.   6 years ago, my wife and I got a free ride onboard C-130 and its flight waypoints include over P.Sudong before heading back to PLA.<br><br>P.Sudong was indeed beautiful.  I had my chance to get on this island via scuba diving trip to P.Jong, situated opp Sudong.  Non of the PCGs was around to patrol the area.  It was hilarious when a couple of us reach the island, combing the coastline, molested the short coconut trees, imagine that we conducted all these activaties without being spotted.  Notes from another users - foreigners landing or illegal activites conduct in vinicity do indeed lead us think abt this intrusion seriously!<br></div>

It must be able fast enough to follow the fleet or if not must be light and small enough to be carry by the LST.<br><br><blockquote>one that is armoured (lightly perhaps) and armed with vulcan cannons - to provide suppressive fire during landing.  Bet there's one at least on the drawing board somewhere.</blockquote>I think i know wat hovercraft u are toking abt. The countries such as Russian are operating such hovercrafts however that wont be practical as i doubt it have the ability to follow a fleet . Even the americans are not operating such huge hovercrafts and they do admit that their hovercrafts are vulnerable to infantry weapon thus air support is needed.<br><br><blockquote>Anyway, please excuse my shallow layman knowledge...doesn't the hovercraft by virtue of it's superior mobility over water as opposed to a fast assault craft,</blockquote>For wat i know , the fast craft is fast enough. On top of that , which i had mentioned , the Fast craft can eat more lead than the hovercraft.<br><br><blockquote>have the ability to bypass the entrenched defenders' position and actually land and mass troops and armour at the enemy's rear where they are weakest?</blockquote>Take a beach as a straight line , if the enemy is the strongest at that line , even if the rear is the weakest , u still have to pass that line.<br><br><blockquote>I mean..why land right in front of an enemy where he's expecting you?</blockquote>Sir , u dun have to picture it as Normandy. U wont have to land infront of masses of enemy if the strike aircrafts do a good job. Besides , CAS will be carry out at the same time when u land. It is alot abt coordination....<br></div>
