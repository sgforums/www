            <div class='col-md body'>Remember the infamous Qing official - Lee Hong Zhang.<br><br>He was protrayed as a traitor in early to mid 20th century. But now, the chinese gov, at least, seems to have a change of mind. In the TV drama Republic (Chinese CCTV prod),  Lee Hong Zhang character had shed the cowardice image. Instead, Lee Hong Zhang had been protraying as a wise stateman with a heart for his country and people.....<br><br>Today, Mr Saddam was protrayed as a tyrant of Iraq.
