The outbreak of war should have sorted out whatever hatred one has kept inside oneself that is because each and everyone know that in time of adversity, we should all the more keep a lookout for one another.<br><br>If it is towards a certain field commander failed leadership and his men is not comfortable working with him, such problems are usually forseen through routine exercises and dealt with appropriately through AAR.

So if war do breaks out, anyone in his right frame of mind would prefer the quick and decisive victory to restore back the peace and tranquility.<br><br>In my opinion, no one in his right mind would go on a rampant gunning down your wartime buddies based on vengeance or accumulative hatred. The outbreak of war should have sorted out whatever hatred one has kept inside oneself that is because each and everyone know that in time of adversity, we should all the more keep a lookout for one another.<br><br>If it is towards a certain field commander failed leadership and his men is not comfortable working with him, such problems are usually forseen through routine exercises and dealt with appropriately through AAR. I personally view backstabbing as a possible scenerio yet rare where the bonds among commanders and theirs men should have been forge during NS and ICT.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_neutral.gif" alt="Neutral" title="Neutral"> </div></blockquote>this is too naive a view. if u think war sorts out whatever hatred one has for others in the same uniform, i sugest u have a look back in history. there has been far too many cases where people use war as an excuse to eliminate their rivals even though they're on the same side.<br><br>and oh yes, wartime "buddy" is a very subjective view. someone might not see himself as a "buddy" of his platoon commander or platoon sgt? and then what then?<br><br>im not saying if its right or wrong to gun down others on your same side. im saying if it happens, nobody can stop it.</div>
