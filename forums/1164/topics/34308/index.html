Norway is the first country to formally participate in the Eurofighter industrial partnership for enhanced versions of the weapon system.<br><br>The agreement covers industrial participation in the Eurofighter programme that will be jointly funded by the Royal Norwegian MoD and Norwegian industry. Areas of particular interest include high technology development work in weapon systems integration, sensors - including radar, and flight controls. The initial contract is valued at Â€20 Million.<br><br>Commenting on the agreement Filippo Bagnato, Chief Executive Officer, Eurofighter GmbH said<br><br>'We consider this agreement as a positive signal from the Norwegian Government that the choice of a replacement fighter has not been decided and that a competitive situation exists. The Eurofighter industry and nations will now work closely with Norway to demonstrate the strength and effectiveness of our partnership to deliver long-term benefits to the Norwegian Government and provide Norwegian industry with high technology work and jobs for its skilled labour force.'<br><br>Eurofighter Typhoon will formally enter service with the partner countries in 2003 and will be the mainstay of NATO air power for at least 30 years.<br><br>Under the partnership arrangement Norwegian companies will benefit from high technology work across the defence and aerospace spectrum. In particular this agreement will open the possibility of additional work within other programmes of the Eurofighter Partner Companies Alenia Aeronautica, BAE SYSTEMS, and EADS.<br><br>High Resolution Eurofighter Typhoon images can be downloaded the photo library. www.eurofighter.com/photolibrary<br><br>More information can be found in the following Royal Norwegian Ministry of Defence press release.<br><br><a href="http://www.eurofighter.com/news/latestnews.asp" rel="nofollow">http://www.eurofighter.com/news/latestnews.asp</a></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Norway joins development and signs LoU<br>Date : 20th March 2003     Source : Unspecified     Author : jwcook<br><br>The Royal Norwegian Ministry of Defence (RNMOD) and Eurofighter GmbH has today signed an overarching industrial participation agreement which will involve Norwegian industry in the further development of the Eurofighter Weapon System.<br><br>Eurofighter is a partnership made up by Germany, Italy, Spain and the United Kingdom. Participating industries include EADS-Deutschland, Alenia Aeronautica, EADS-CASA and BAE SYSTEMS, also referred to as the Eurofighter Partner Companies (EPCs).<br><br>The agreement lays down the general terms and conditions on how future cooperation between Norwegian industry and the EPCs will take place. It will be followed by separate contracts between Norwegian companies and the EPCs.<br><br>The RNMOD is committed to a contribution of up to 10 million Euros over a period of five years (2003 Â– 2007). This financial contribution is dependent on a similar contribution from participating Norwegian companies. All financial contributions will be made payable to the Norwegian companies on the basis of agreed work packages between the Norwegian companies and the EPCs.<br><br>In parallel with the overarching industrial participation agreement, the RNMOD is in the final stages of negotiating a Letter of Understanding (LoU) with the Eurofighter Partner Nation Governments represented by the NATO Eurofighter Tornado Management Agency (NETMA). This LoU will enable the Royal Norwegian Air Force to receive relevant operational information on the fighter aircraft.<br><br><a href="http://www.eurofighter.starstreak.net/Eurofighter/news/" rel="nofollow">http://www.eurofighter.starstreak.net/Eurofighter/news/</a></div>
