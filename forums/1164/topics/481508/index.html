              <p>Hi, I have recently been informed that I have passed the COMPASS test. They have scheduled me in for a medical checkup a month from now. I thought the standard sequence would be COMPASS test - - &gt; Interview - - &gt; Medical checkup? Can anyone please advise! How long will I need to wait after the medical checkup to proceed on to the next stage? </p>
              <p><span style="line-height: 1.231;">Two more questions:</span></p>
              <p><span style="line-height: 1.231;">Is the dropout rate of BMT/OCS high for girls? </span></p>
              <p>I read that the salary range for Graduate is $3360 - 5170. This range is according to the class of honours? Say, 3rd class will be $3360?</p>
              <p>Please kindly help to enlighten me on these questions. It would be awesome if you're actually working as one or have friends/siblings having this as a career. </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Thanks a lot! </p>

              <p>First thing - Don't be so kan chiong. Actually if this is your 'normal', you may not have the aptitude/suitability to be in C3. This is a job that requires an inherent calmness...</p>
              <p>The compass test/interview when/where/how long actually is all irrelevant. Basically in SAF, they decide and schedule at their convenience/slots, its not up to you to ask/request. It can be in any order, any time. This is military life, not civilian, no custoemer service to talk about.</p>
              <p>If you signed on as an officer, in BMT, you'll be assessed on your suitability to be an officer. Its not difficult to pass, no need to be smart aleck or extra smart. Just need to show that you can at least do what a basic soldier needs to do, ie:</p>
              <p>- can fire a rifle accurately (no need marksman, but must pass)</p>
              <p>- pass IPPT (no need silver/gold, minimum pass)</p>
              <p>- pass SIT test (situation test) that is assessed by NSmen (aka reservist) officers on your suitability to command and lead.</p>
              <p>Nerds/weak/cannot think/kanchiong like spider = fail. Do as normal and fulfil criteria = pass.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>If you care so much about the EXACT salary, this job is also not for you. While its a reasonable paying job, probably in the upper-mid-scale of society, you'll find your elite friends making more money and have all the freedom in the world.</p>
              <p>A military life is restricted, on-call, on-duty 24/7, leave is subject to approval, deployment overseas is non-debatable unless you're pregnant. You need real passion and love for the job to survive, else you'll feel cheated, jaded and hate SAF, hate government....so if you're anal about the exact pay you'll get, forget it la...u're going to live a very bitter life if you get in.</p>
