Moreover, Bismark's captain didnt managed to fill-up the oil tank fully during her last port call which was fatal as she couldnt steam at full speed when pursued by the subsequent british fleets coming after her. Unfortunately, a british torpedo plane damaged one of her rudder and turned Bismark back towards the pursuing british ships...<br><br>The british fired at her at point blank distance but couldnt sink her. It was bloody on the deck and Bismark's crew knowing that the british will never give up firing until sinking her, decided to sink the boat by themselves using explosives. Her captain who was still alive went down together with her while some of the crews managed to bail out to tell the story...<br><br>Bismark fought well but was not lucky enough in her maiden voyage. Unlike Yamato which was just big and a white elephant, Bismark is the ship the allied feared the most as it was equiped with the most accurate firing system.</div></blockquote>ney....HMS Hood is not a battleship, it is just a battle crusier<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><img src="http://img413.imageshack.us/img413/4305/yamatonr4.jpg"><br>Yamato<br>The Japanese Super Battleships YAMATO and MUSASHl were the largest battleships ever built by any nation. The YAMATO was completed just before the outbreak of the war in the Pacific and was Admiral Yamamoto's flagship during the Pearl Harbor attack and the Battle of Midway. The YAMATO continued to be the flagship of the combined fleet even after Yamamoto's death, but for most of the war this ship was kept almost in the backwaters of operation in the south and central pacific. It was not until the Battle of the Philippine Sea in June of 1944 that this ship was committed to action, and for the first time the US Navy got a good look at her. The MUSASHl was lost in the Battle of Leyte Gulf after taking an incredible 20 torpedoes and 10 bomb hits, even then taking over 4 hours to finally sink. The YAMATO on the other hand survived long enough to be sent on a one way mission to try and stem the tide of battle at Okinawa. The massive battleship was only 50 miles south of Japan when she was overwhelmed and sunk by US Navy aircraft, again only after taking an incredible amount of damage from torpedoes and bombs.<br><br><img src="http://img386.imageshack.us/img386/3509/bismarckda5.jpg"><br>Bismarck<br>The BISMARCK &amp; TIRPITZ were the largest and last Battleships to be completed by the German navy. At the time of their completion these were the largest, fastest and most powerful battleships in service in any of the worlds navies. The BISMARCK'S career was short and famous, her only war cruise catching the attention of almost the entire civilized world. From her quick and incredible destruction of the Royal Navy's H.M.S. HOOD until her own sinking 3 days later, almost every Royal Navy warship in the Atlantic was put on alert to help track BISMARCK down. The life of the TIRPITZ lasted a few years longer, laying in a Norwegian fjord, she successfully tied down many major warships of both the Royal and US navies that had to remain on patrol to guard against her breaking out into the Atlantic shipping lanes.<br><br><img src="http://img386.imageshack.us/img386/5567/untitledgn3.png"><br>Scharnhorst<br>The German Battleships SCHARNHORST and GNEISENAU were the most active of all the big ships that were built by the German navy prior to the outbreak of World War Two. The SCHARNHORST was an almost constant consort of her sister ship GNEISENAU when both of these ships carried out successful anti-shipping raids out into the vast Atlantic ocean. The cost to the allies in both ships sunk as well as ships and war supplies to track them down or keep them in check, far surpassed the effort it took the Germans to construct and operate these two ships. SCHARNHORST was lost in the Battle of North Cape on 26-DEC.-1943 while trying to attack an allied convoy headed to Russia. GNEISENAU was severely damaged in drydock and never fully repaired.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>If memory serves, ships like the Queen Elizabeth, though lesser in power to the newer battleships had nice reputations for fire control and targeting. The QE for example, led the Royal Navy's Mediterranean campaign, though she got hit by Italian frogmen.<br><br>The later King George Vs, especially Duke of York had excellent fire control radar and she would have been a better match to the Bismarck. KG V didn't have the radar installed or something. Prince of Wales was worse. She engaged Bismarck during a shakeout cruise with techs working on her equipment while at sea. Ridiculous.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>The Americans tended to build their ships without constraints, contrasting with the Brits that never built their ships up to that size. The only ship that reached that size was the Vanguard, an enlarged KG V. There was supposed to be a Lion class battleship that probably would have matched the Iowa, but it was scrapped towards the end of the war.</div>
