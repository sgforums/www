            <div class='col-md body'>i think for Yamato, it was created and built as 'most powerful battleship" in mankind history, thats on paper, given the armor and arnaments that she has.  unfortunately, the Japanese navy want her keep her wrapped with cotton wool to prevent her from any 'scratches' until its too late.<br><br>as such, and luckily, for that, she did not go out to fight a real battle before she goes down.  The only and last fight she has was, in a way, unfair fight, without air cover and such.  Compared to Bismark who fought and sunk ships and went down in a more 'bloody' manner, Yamato 'died' in a less gallant manner.<br><br>its an irony, i am glad that Yamato 'died' in that manner, rather than went out to sea and sunk more ships.  But from a military nut point of view, she should be given opportunity to shine - if only she fights on side of the allies....</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>At that time of the Bismarck's maiden voyage, the German Navy is sorely in one key area, Dual Purpose Guns. Therefore, when Bismarck left port, her AA configuration was rather inadequate with just several limited high-angle guns at best. Of course there are also light flaks placed on wherever deck space is available. Had there been DP guns fitted on her, she could have warded off the torpedo bombers.<br><br>Another drawback of the Bismarck's design was her poor distribution of armour. In fact, some areas which were designed to withstand up to 15inch shelling were penetrated by 8inch shelling.<br><br>I'll pick Yamato as the most powerful battleship in history. It would be interesting to see her duel one on one with the Iowa class battleship.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I don't think Yamato is the best...... on paper, it is the best. having 18" guns instead of the 16" use by the US or 12" use by the German.<br><br>But Yamato was never "Fully" use in naval warfare. In the battle of Midway, it acts more as a flag ship for the japanese navy...... didn't even fire its guns. After the 4 jap carriers were sunk...... Yamato sail back to japanese port and did not leave until the US naval were at japan's doorstep.<br><br>IMHO...... Yamato is only the most powerful on paper. The US battleship which live through more battle till today is the best......</div>
