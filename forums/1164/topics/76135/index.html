            <div class='col-md body'>Just before I ord, I heard from Senior Commanders while they are chatting that there is this "Legendary CO" in the (1 or 2) PDF. The reason that why he is regarded as legendary as during his unit (a NS unit) was enjoying their R&amp;R in Ex Starlight, few of his men kanna extortion by the local gangsters. The reservists refused to give and end up being beaten up the local gangsters. So when these poor reservists went back to their hotel, their peers saw and reported to their commanders and then subsequently the CO knew about the entire incident.<br><br>So this Legendary CO do is that he actually lead the entire NS Battalion to look for the gangsters that beat the reservists and walloped them until "they can't recognise their faces".. In the end the police came and thought that it was a gang dispute and brought the Bn to the police station for investigations... In the end, nothing happen to the Bn and the Legendary CO kanna "henta taki" for the rest of his career.<br><br>Hence I would hope if there is anyone who have heard of this matter or work with him or have participated in the above mentioned incidents shared with us your views...</div>
