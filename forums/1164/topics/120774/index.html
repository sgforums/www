            <div class='col-md body'>With its South Korean win as a template, Boeing is confident that the Republic of Singapore Air Force (RSAF) will follow by selecting the F-15T Strike Eagle as its new fighter. With heavy U.S. government support, Boeing clinched the 40-plane, $4.6 billion deal in Korea two years ago and is set to deliver the F-15Ks between November next year and August 2008. Various enhancements and new weapons on the F-15K may also be offered here, in a deal that would be partly foreign military sales, partly commercial.<br><br>Â“We go faster, farther and with more weapons,Â” claimed F-15T campaign manager Tom Lillis here yesterday. Example: a 1,000-mile range mission at high altitude carrying twelve 500-pound JDAMs plus four air-to-air missiles; a payload of 29,000 pounds if additional wing stations 1 and 9 are activated (otherwise, still 25,000 pounds); and a list of weapons already integrated that is as long as your arm, and to which SLAM-ER (standoff land attack missile extended response) has been added.<br><br>Lillis is a former U.S. Air Force jet jockey, and he offered airshow visitors some advice on how to judge the combat jets flying here. Â“Our contenderÂ’s thrust/weight superiority really shows in the vertical climb,Â” he noted. The Strike Eagle retains all the air-to-air capability of the F-15C interceptor, he added. But isnÂ’t that an old plane, now? Â“The Strike Eagle is 80 percent different, and it first flew in 1986, about the same time as our competitors.Â”<br><br>Lillis addressed concerns that the Strike Eagle is expensive to operate. The new digital map set, mission computer with commercial off-shelf hardware and APG-63 V3 active array radar (if selected, Â“would help lower the life-cycle costs.Â” Furthermore, Singapore could opt for a single-pilot operation on some missions to save on crew costs. Â“An existing international customerÂ” is already examining that option (this can mean only Israel, Korea or Saudi Arabia).<br><br>What about that perennial issue, source code? Singapore is bound to push for maximum technology release, including the ability to reprogram the mission computer in-house. Knowledgeable observers will recall that the U.S. downgraded the radars and electronic warfare systems in Saudi ArabiaÂ’s F-15S models for political reasons. Â“Singapore wants to maintain and adapt the new fightersÂ…(but) we have to abide by U.S. government rules because it owns this stuff, not us,Â” Lillis admitted. Earlier, Lillis told Aviation International News that Â“many of the systems being proposed for Singapore are more advanced than those currently installed on U.S. F-15E models.Â”<br><br>With plenty of room for growth (55 percent in power and 26 percent in cooling, and a U.S. Air Force plan to continue flying F-15Es until at least 2030, Boeing insists that the Strike Eagle still has a long way to go.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>if we purchase either the Rafale or Eurofighter. We will have the whole spectums of weaponary especially the Storm Shadow or Apache, Brimstone, Meteor (2010), Mica and etc. Thats gonna be impressive. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"><br><br></div>
