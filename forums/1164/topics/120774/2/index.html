            <div class='col-md body'>I don't quite understand the issue with the source codes......<br><br>If it's WVR weapons....you probably need to modify/add/control the HUD and HMD symbols? This one is problematic. I don't think you need source codes.<br><br>If the mission computer is COTS then it's possible to plug (VME or Compact PCI) a RSAF specific processor card that can talk with the other existing cards. Probably at cost of greater time delay.<br><br>Boeing can generate a set of APIs or Data and Control Packets for this specific processor to integrate the DASH or other weapons. But this require alot of planning to capture all the parameters you need for such integration.<br><br>If it's BVR or standoff.....assuming it's WSO's job.....then it's possible to use another MMC with video multiplex/mix into existing display units. All the information to compute the firing solution should be on the 1553 databus.</div>

In fact, keeping quiet is better... Leak too much, your rival knows what you are offering...</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>it was interesting - there was loads of press hype for the Eurofighter...<br>but for the F-15 there wasnt very much.<br>what was evident though was the continual appearance of pairs of F-15's with F-16's in the air over Singapore...<br><br>that probably says more than anything else..<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>remember that the ROKAF also operates F16s. so might not be related to the NGF contract.....<br><br>let us not jump the gun.</div>
