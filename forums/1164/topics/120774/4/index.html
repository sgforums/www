            <div class='col-md body'>Very true - he is the former CEO....but oh what a life he has led and how  Boeing is better off because of him.<br><br>In another time, playing around would be seen as nothing. Who knows..... he may sign a 100m deal with Sony (or Disney!) for the movie rights to his story!<br><br>He is still a potent force.....in spirit (as to be expected for his person and his life) and the envious "playing part".<br><br>Wrong place wrong time.......someone said "....just don't get caught."</div>
