            <div class='col-md body'>hmmm ray seems like you basically want an ocean going artillery platform.  not very useful tho. insurgents fighting in the middle east would be out of range of a battleship sitting in the persian gulf. they don't mass in numbers far from civilian areas to make bombardment feasible either.<br><br>conventional enemies like china or russia would sink it easily (assuming that the US ever does the now inconcievable act of striking coastal cities indiscrimanately).  billy mitchell showed long ago that a 2000lb bomb dropped near a well armoured battleship was more than enuff to blow the hull off. no amount of armour or countermeasures is gonna save the battleship from aerial or naval enemies intent on killing it.  remember that whatever countermeasures the US is likely to develop can be used on other ships so ultimately even its survivability is not going to factor in its usefulness if other more nimble ships can be as hard to kill.  you could have a group of ships protecting it like in a carrier but thats a huge cost for far less usefulness.<br><br>perhaps if you told us what you think a battleship could be used for specifically people would be more enthused with the idea.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by fudgester:</div><div class="quote_body">I doubt it. You'd need lots and lots of armour to defend against a Harpoon or a Gabriel, and that would weigh the ship down. And even then, that's no guarantee that the missile won't cause damage.<br>.</div></blockquote>When the US re-activated their 4 mothballed battleships in the 1980's, armour against modern missiles (such as Exocet, with up to 160kg warhead),  proponents claimed, was not an issue for battleships. That's because the battleships, with at least 16 inch (nearly 45 cm) of hardened steel armour is almost impervious to modern, relatively lighweight missiles (unless they hit at the right place).<br>Remember the biggest battleships, Yamato and Mushashi, had to be sunk by over twenty 500 pound bombs + torpedo hits. Of course credit goes to the crew for excellent use of waterproof compartments to keep these warships afloat so long. For a bigger missile like the Brahmos, I think you'll still have to have multiple hits to cause significant damage.<br>Although these BB have been retired, certain advantages they offer have been missed by the US Navy and Marine Corp - including their 16 inch guns for shore bombardment (range &gt;20 miles) as a prelude to amphibious landing. True, the WWII era 16 inch guns are less accurate than missiles and these ships require a crew of nearly 2000. But shells are cheaper to deliver than using aircraft (not to mention the loss of aircraft if shot down, political cost of a pilot captured as POW etc). Besides, many (including those on the receiving end) say the psychological impact of having a 16 inch shell (2700 pound shell, enough to clear a helicopter landing zone in the Vietnamese jungle) fired at you is nearly as bad as enduring a B-52 bombing raid. Anyway, the Littoral combat ship (LCS) is supposed to address some of these loss in capabilities (shore bombardment using two 155mm howitzers) plus its own stealth features, ability to operate in shallow waters, small crew (under 100), multi-mission capability etc.<br>I doubt if the BB will ever be revived, but sort of re-incarnated in another smaller, more survivable, more versatile form.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I think there is still a place for a mobile naval gun platform is this day and age. It may not need to be the size of a battleship but the power of artillery can turn the tide of war.<br><br>Imagine a floating platform with about 6 guns onboard. thats some serious firepower and its way more mobile than land based artillery systems. Of course it has to be protected as its defenses wont be very strong. Perhaps if possible throw in a few phalanxes and other air defense systems but the main job of the vessel will be to provide naval gun fire support for friendly troops.

You just need to ground stabilize the targeting pod and flip the laser arm switch.<br><br>Secondly, IMO infantry that are considered worthy targets are generally found near the front.  Hence are generally within range of friendly artillery if available. So you don't have to drop anything on them.  Infantry found deep in enemy territory, isn't really worth bombing since they pose no threat.  Even if they are targets of opportunities...<br><br>A bombardment battleship is definitely not the cost efficient way to go.<br><br>However, a nice large logistic ship, with ability to refuel, re-arm ships would be nice for really long missions.  Like a floating mini-naval base.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>i dun think missiles can replace shells for artillery bombardment. Perhaps the MLRS but not precision missiles. that would be too costly.<br><br>And i was not suggesting the use of battleships for artillery support, I suggested a smaller vessel with about six howitzers. Heck, it can even just be on a floating barge but that aint small either  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_redface.gif" alt="Embarassed" title="Embarassed"><br><br>But I just realised, why not put an MLRS system or two on a vessel? Smaller more compact and way more firepower with the capability to make the munitions smart when needed. It will be combining the best of both worlds.
