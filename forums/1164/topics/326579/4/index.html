              <p>And BTW you are still running away.</p>
              <p>You still haven't answered on degaussing for mines, why you ask if metal hulls are okay when degaussing has been around since WW2?</p>
              <p>Interestingly how come you are also quiet on the fact that despite being in the same weight class, the LCS is significantly faster then the our Formidable frigates? Our Formidable can only max out at 27 knots while the LCS can go up to 50, which is nearly twice as fast.</p>
              <p>Never do your homework and think you can anyhow ask questions rite?</p>
              <p>Please answer, or are you going to run away again?</p>

              <p>If you want to convince people that the LCS is such a bad idea, then use logic and facts to do it.</p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>So how come so far all your logic and facts have produced things like ships needing to teleport to areas of trouble at any given time, launching F-18s off "mini-cvs", crashing FANTAIL into things, carrying SAR-21 by one handle in battle like a handbag and inline skate force?</strong></span></p>
              <p>LOL</p>
              <p>So you think the USN is going to operate LCS without any configuration at all times until times of war? I think you're not thinking at all.</p>
              <p>Basically and I say this again, the LCS is supposed to give the USN an inexpensive, littorial ship to operate with the capacity to change its roles as and when needed to reduce on having redundant hull types or needing to build more ships to fufill a specialized role.</p>
              <p>If you don't want to accept this or think it's an unworkable concept for the simple reason the RSN or ST does not have it and it's threatening the imaginary popularity or "superiority" of the small brown water navy of a certain island nation then it's really your loss, you are the one who needs to constantly decieve yourself and remain blind and ignorant, choosing only to see the world through the "anything SAF does is good and if other militaries perform better or have better ideas they are flawed and stupid ideas because I need to feel good about my own SAF" glasses.</p>
              <p>Obviously all this is lost out on you who sits in one corner sucking your lollipop and repeating the same, debunked and lously points over and over again.</p>
              <p>I don't think the USN makes good choices all the time, but quite obviously, their rate of making good choices far exceeds your own, lionnoisy.</p>

              <p>For some reason lionnoisy makes a big who-ha when the Yanks take this technology further and actually implement hulls that can be configured as an when they are needed in short order. But oh wait, he's more known for having more noise then knowledge on the subject matter.</p>
              <p>What is funnier is that he's trying to paint this as a major disadvantage of the class when by any measure it is actually its strongest point. As opposed to having to constantly operate ships of differing types or finding a shortfall in certain hull classes when a certain need arises, the USN can now configure it's flexible hulls to tailor to their needs as and when they need, allowing them force-to-task-suitability that is otherwise not possible with having multiple redundant ship types.</p>
              <p>What is pure comedy he misses out the entire point of the concept and instead relies soley on his "what if, anyday, anytime" a single lone LCS faces a task that it is not configured for?</p>
              <p>Might as well ask the same question of our Formidible frigates. What if one day, "anyday, anytime" our Formidibles find themselves in a minefield and realize that they are not an anti-mining ship?</p>
              <p>What rubbish.</p>
              <p>Oh I am sure the largest navy in the world with the biggest budget and most powerful sensor network would somehow send out lone littorial ships with absolutely no support whatsoever to get surprised by the enemy.</p>
              <p>The greater rubbish is that he tries to say that 24 hours to change the ship's role is too much due to how "quickly" war can break out. Not only does he not explain how on earth this war is breaking out, he simply assumes as he does before, that mysterous stealth ships and planes will suddenly appear out of nowhere and show the "unsuitability" of whatever system he happens to fix his illogical gaze upon.</p>
              <p>Seriously... which power in the world is going to try to "surprise" the USN? And which navy goes to war within 24 hours? To sail the fleet to any location takes months of prep in harbour as well as actual sailing to location. If the LCS is going to war, the USN would have had plenty of time to prepare it for the intended task.</p>
              <p>Might as well say that all citizens in Singapore need to have a SAR-21 by their side at all times because "anyday, anytime" war can break out and going to our camps and drawing our weapons will take too much time.</p>
              <p>Seriously, this guy is totally pwned in here.</p>

              <p>Well you should check out his M4 thread, he's going to great lengths to argue that no computerized fire control system exists for the FN2000 nor does it have the capacity to fire air bursting munitions when there is an abundant amount of literature out there on the web that testifies to that ability.</p>
              <p>Additionally, the abilty of the FN2000 to use a FCS has long been established as one of it's modular variants when the rifle first came out in 2001.</p>
              <p>His main excuse "the FN official webpage dun have, ABM is difficult technology must learn to walk before crawl", and that all the sources out on the web must be faked, hoaxed or mistakened.</p>
              <p>LOL</p>
              <p>Now with pictures posted of the FN2000 with it's fire control computer, especially with details on how it works I wonder what he's going to say next.</p>
              <p>I think short of exploding an airburst 40mm from an FN2000 over his head, he'll probably try to find some other way to argue white to black.</p>

              <p>I am not saying SG technology is most advanced.</p>
              <p>But i can say SG  just do the basic right first,clearing the deck</p>
              <p>as much as possible before u talk about stealth technology.</p>
              <p>In most of the time,just do the basic things first.</p>

              <p>I might agree with your statement that Formidable indeed made more effort than the LCS as far as RCS is concerned and hence disagree with Asian Aussie.</p>
              <p>But I must say exposing your foxcle leaves a fair bit of space for more equipment, and frankly speaking, the yanks probably did not put stealth as a foremost property for this design, preferring performance and volume over stealth.</p>

              <p>lionnoisy has special abilities beyond the average human being. he can see stealth problems, and detect the limitations of all stealth vessels. he can even see the JSF's VLO stealth limitations because he has skimmed through a carlo kopp article, and be aware of even small tiny limitations.</p>
              <p>this intelligent superbeing has claimed that formidable class is more stealthy because he can see the difference.</p>
              <p>there are always the lunatic fringe who share the lionnoisy's understanding of it. im sure you belong safely to the sane, rational majority of folks who can see the pure simple idiocity thats lionnoisy spouts regularly, is usually a figment of his deraged imagination.</p>

              <p>concealed bitts sure can reflect less RCS than exposed bitts.Right?</p>

              <p>I wont shy to say SG ship,oil rigs design and building not so bad.</p>
              <p>Of course,we still have to learn from others in naval design etc.</p>

              <p>dude, haha , you missed the butt of the joke :P</p>
              <p>lionnoisy is implying that the MGB or RSN fearless class are
              actually stealth ships because they feature a clean nice looking
              deck design.</p>
              <p>if that dosent show how shallow, stupid and moronic he is, i
              dont know what does.</p>
              <p>lionnoisy has special abilities beyond the average human being.
              he can see stealth problems, and detect the limitations of all
              stealth vessels. he can even see the JSF's VLO stealth limitations
              because he has skimmed through a carlo kopp article, and be aware
              of even small tiny limitations.</p>
              <p>this intelligent superbeing has claimed that formidable class is
              more stealthy because he can see the difference.</p>
              <p>there are always the lunatic fringe who share the lionnoisy's
              understanding of it. im sure you belong safely to the sane,
              rational majority of folks who can see the pure simple idiocity
              thats lionnoisy spouts regularly, is usually a figment of his
              deraged imagination.</p>

              <p>Have I say SG ship is stealth?Thats mean totally invisible in radar.</p>
              <p>i dunt think any ship is 100% stealth.I just said--</p>
              <p><em>Look at SG ship try to be stealth--</em></p>
              <p><em>u can see no window and very 'clean' to<span style="color: #ff0000;"> reduce R</span>CS!!</em></p>
              <p>Did i say no RCS at all?NO!!I just say REDUCE.</p>
              <p>Just to reduce RCS!!Not 100% stealth.</p>
              <p>Will less window reduce RCS?Yes.</p>
              <p>Will no bitts on decks reduce RCS?yes.</p>
              <p>These all just a small things which SG can do to reduce RCS.</p>
              <p>We cant afford to spend billions just on one ship</p>
              <p>to be so called Stealth ship.We wont use a fancy name</p>
              <p>to build a new class of ship.</p>
