              <p>1.<em>LCS is NOT so stealth.</em></p>
              <p>2.<em>Also,</em>he said the umbrella concept cant work.</p>
              <p>Sg Ty once mentioned the umbrella concept can give LCS full protection.</p>
              <p>http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2009/feb/01/ship-shopping-list/</p>
              <blockquote>
              <p>Despite the stated requirement for <span style="color: #ff0000;">stealth,</span> it is not optimized in
                  either of the LCS prototypes. Both ships display relatively large radar
                  targets. The mono-hull (<a title="Lockheed Martin Corporation" href="http://www.washingtontimes.com/themes/?Theme=Lockheed+Martin+Corporation">Lockheed</a>) is derived from a fast yacht hull form and unsurprisingly, stealth was not an important consideration. The trimaran variant (<a title="General Dynamics Corporation" href="http://www.washingtontimes.com/themes/?Theme=General+Dynamics+Corporation">General Dynamics</a>) provides a radar "tunnel" to amplify the radar return from the ship when observed from certain aspects.</p>
              <p>Moreover, both hull forms have inherent large and/or noisy acoustic
                  signatures. Further, both prototypes will have predictability large
                  infrared signatures when operating at higher speeds. Neither of these
                  prototypes has anything but a very limited "point" air defense
                  capability. In today's expanding threat environment, any ship designed
                  to be a 21st-century warship is fatally flawed that costs more than
                  $550 million and does not incorporate multiple fire-control systems and
                  a reasonable area air defense capability against stealthy cruise
                  missiles. The argument that an air defense<span style="color: #ff0000;"> "umbrella"</span> for the LCS will
                  be provided by other air and surface platforms is suspect, if only
                  because the LCS is touted as a precursor weapons system, intended to
                  "sanitize" littoral waters.</p>

              <p><br>Looking at the USN ship, it is interesting to note that the foxcle is exposed on the deck. That will affect RCS, definitely. In contrast our frigates have theirs buried within the hull, making the forward deck rather clean. As to how much this affects RCS, I won't know.</p>
              <p>And if I read correctly, then I do not doubt that our frigate is superior in many ways, but that's because the LCS design is biased towards "austere", "cost-saving" designs. These are just my observations.</p>
              <p>Moreover it is interesting to note that this ship can act as a landing ship, mine-sweeper to name a few roles due to its modular design. Clearly, the LCS is a compromise between the different requirements, while our frigate......is what it is, albeit a light one.</p>
              <p>Therefore, why compare?</p>

              <p>I think we are clear now.</p>
              <p>Suppose u are the captain of LCS and in ,say, Mine Warfare mission package.</p>
              <p>But u are now tasked to destory a sub few hundred miles away.</p>
              <p>So a mission package of ASW will be delivered to u in rough sea</p>
              <p>at scheduled time and designated location,by heli or ship.</p>
              <p>When the package is delivered,your crews changed and tested</p>
              <p>the sys and if everything ok.You go to hunt the sub.</p>
              <p>Hopefully within 24 hours.What a genius!!</p>

              <p>off set the down sides:</p>

              <p><br>I think the LCS won't be totally useless against other threats even when it's carrying only one specialised module. Seriously, I don't think the US Navy is that stupid. It's gotta have some other defensive capabilities. Not very powerful, for sure, because if you wanna specialise with themodules, you have to give up other stuff like huge racks of missiles, but I like to think that the US Navy isn't suicidal.</p>
              <p>For example, if you look at the graphic posted by lionnoisy, the LCS has a helo hangar with space for Seahawk helicopters. Those can deal with some surface threats (eg small 3rd world nation missile boats) by firing anti-ship missiles.  Those helos can hunt subs too. (Worst come to worst, there's that gun in front. Maybe can scare people away.)</p>
              <p>Besides, I think the LCS isn't gonna work alone; it'll probably deployed in a aircraft carrier battle group, or escorted by crusiers or whatnot. Also, a group of LCS with different capibilities could well complement each other. For example, we can have one anti-surface ships, two anti-sub ships (because subs are worrying) and one mine ship as a composite battle group that can take care of itself.</p>
              <p>So the concept is more or less okay in my book. The only thing is, yes, the turnaround time for the modules and the logistics will be a headache.</p>

              <p>This time he is getting pretty funny, he's trying to suggest that the RSN can trump the USN...</p>
              <p>Lionnoisy as usual is putting up a lot of smoke and mirrors and showing us pretty much how little he knows about the subject, the LCS was never intended to be a jack-of-all-trades and master of none but instead a modular platform by which a navy can use to perform many different tasks that would require several different classes of ships of similar tonnage.</p>
              <p>For example, instead of having many different classes of ships for various duties, the USN can now configure each and every system to its requirements. Some rouge nation mining international waters? Instead of waiting for days to cart a minesweeper over, you can save plenty of time by simply configuring one of your LCS to that task. </p>
              <p>Additionally, what makes lionnoisy think that only one configuration of LCS will be operating alone? In typical naval operations you will have several different roles of LCS will be operating together.</p>
              <p>As usual, he uses his "what if miracle naval ships appear next to a single LCS out of nowhere nonsense" that he likes to use so often, which simply does not happen in reality due to the way the USN operates. The only foolish one here it seems, is lionnoisy.</p>
              <p>Simply put, lionnoisy might as well ask why that our SAF soldiers doing guard duty are only configured for one task, and that is anti-personnel. What if, one day, anytime an enemy tank suddenly appears right in front of them and all they have is their SAR-21?!! So he better suggest that they carry a MATADOR while prowing that is. What if enemy ROFLcopter suddenly appear? Our SAF soldiers better carry SAR-21 GL, MATADOR, and Igla manpad sams then and go about their rounds.</p>
              <p>Pure and utter rubbish, just like him trying to suggest F-18s will be launched off "mini-cvs"</p>
              <p>ROFLCOPTER!</p>
              <p>If anything, lionnoisy seems to miss out that the LCS actually gives the USN great savings in terms of training, logistics and maintenence when it comes to operating one flexible ship type that can be configured for multiple tasks in response to the situtation as opposed to having a fleet with many different ship types that are stuck with you more or less for the duration of the war. In any case, note the idea of the LCS was to create a flexible and CHEAP class to run in lieu of using more expensive systems for tasks for which they would be overkill.</p>
              <p>So what can I say about lionnoisy's hu-ha in here about the LCS?</p>
              <p>Blown clear out of the water.</p>
              <p>Say, for some reason lionnoisy is very quiet about how our Formidible stacks up against the USN Zumwalt class destroyers.</p>

              </blockquote>
              <p>Look at our SAR-21 that the basic SAF soldier still uses.</p>
              <p>How has it changed in the last 10 years since it's conception when so many advanced small-arms systems have come out?</p>
              <p>Even the US M-16 has gone through numerous upgrades and actually have more advanced sighting systems then the SAR-21 the SAF trooper uses.</p>
              <p>And for your information, some of our units still stuck with the US legendary rifle that is several versions below the current legendary version that the US is using.</p>
              <p>So what's all this promise about the SAR-21 being the rifle the help the SAF into the 21st century? It's only 2008 and already it's falling behind.</p>

              <p>Use your common sense, the idea of LCS is not unlike the idea of modular small arms, in which one common platform can be configured for different roles from micro-SMG all the way to LMG. Not unlike the FN2000 or the Tavor.</p>
              <p>An anti-mine LCS is not going to be operating alone without conventional cover from ASW or conventionally configured ships. The idea, which seems to be lost out on you not because it's hard to understand but because you just insist on trying to turn white to black and ending up not only failing that but making yourself look bad, is that the LCS was intended to be a platform that can be configured to multiple tasks, greatly saving on operating costs as well as affording flexibility instead of having to cart in multiple ships of different classes for one role.</p>
              <p>For some reason this logic seems to be lost on you, who keep insisting that for some reason, all LCS operate alone and will somehow stumble across something they are not equipped for.</p>
              <p>Can you push the pause button before you make anymore mistakes?</p>
