              <div class="info">By <a href="mailto:ascutro@airforcetimes.com?subject=Question%20from%20NavyTimes.com%20reader">Andrew Scutro</a> - Staff writer<br> Posted : Wednesday Nov 12, 2008 12:33:19 EST</div>
              <p>NORFOLK, Va. — The Navy on Monday confirmed the authenticity of
              photos revealing corrosion and oil leaks aboard the amphibious
              transport dock San Antonio, which began circulating on the Internet
              over the weekend. But a Navy spokeswoman added that the damage did not
              pose a danger to sailors and Marines on the deployed ship.</p>
              <p>Meanwhile,
              the lube oil system leaks, which forced the ship into a repair yard in
              Bahrain on Oct. 31 in the middle of its maiden deployment, are expected
              to take longer to fix than a previously expected two weeks, Pat Dolan,
              spokeswoman for Naval Sea Systems Command, said Monday.</p>
              <p>The extended overseas pit stop is due to trouble getting needed materials to fix leaks in the lube oil system, she said.</p>

              <p>Pulling a deployed ship <a href="http://www.navytimes.com/news/2008/11/navy_san_antonio_110608/">into the yard for repairs</a> isn’t exactly the way things are supposed to go. Ship builders often
              complain about the Navy’s shifting requirements, and that’s a fair
              point. But revised plans don’t explain shoddy construction. Did some

              <p>I think its hard for those who have not served in the navy, and especially on board a ship to understand the family like bonds that is built by the crew, and their affection for their vessel. </p>
              <p>I doubt that SgTrex had done this out of intentional disrespect to any of the crew members, nor would he be aware of an affection or respect towards an inanimate object such as ship.</p>
              <p>I prefer to leave this at his discretion whether to take down the pictures or not after understanding the sensitivity of this view.  If other moderators disagree, I leave it to their discretion to moderate his post.</p>

              <p><strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">Actually I perfectly understand the tragedy of RSS Courageous, and that is my MAIN point... should the issues and affairs of any military be used for our own "political" let's bash something agenda ala. lionnoisy?</span></strong></p>
              <p>Finally some people are getting the point that this behaviour is not acceptable.</p>
              <p>Unfortunately it is the actions of lionnoisy that attempt to hijack our military and the greatest traditions of it as well as impounding on the misfortunes (real of not) of other nations and their military for the purpose of <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">TRUE</span></strong> malice that do the most <strong>disrespect</strong> to our nation and it's military.</p>
              <p>An effective way to get him to answer or give pause is to point to the our own safety issues as well as accidents and use them the way he does, and these incidents need to be illustrated as well as given a twist with his own logic to show them for the true folly they are.</p>
              <p>My point at the end of the day is to illustrate just how ridiculus and discusting lionnoisy's behavior is, that is attempting to take the misfortune (real or not) of any military for our own agenda. I have no vendetta against the SAF and have served in it, what I'm doing is to parody a NOISYLION, the opposite of lionnoisy that does all he does, except with a anti-Singaporean bent to show just how ridiculus this kind of behaviour is.</p>
              <p>So my point is yes, you ought to be disturbed by this lionnoisy-kind of posting. If we truly know what is good for us the moderators ought to remove these kinds of postings entirely, that is postings hijacking the military and it's traditions and sacrifices done for a political purpose.</p>
              <p>So it's your call storywolf... personally it is my opinion that you move not to censor lionnoisy entirely, but "redirect" his more irrational posts and turn them into something funny, and something he does not expect. That will shut him up somewhat.</p>
              <p>But as long as he carries on the way he does, a noisylion will need to be around to counter the lionnoisy, as well as to remind (and shock us if we must) to the low nature of his acts, even if it is by parody and breaking our own O.B. markers.</p>

              <p>However, perhaps all of us can consider if it will be more helpful to engage some of Lionnoisy's argument intellectually, argumentatively even though he doesn't or refuse to see the point of it.  <span style="text-decoration: underline;">At least it benefits the rest of us as forum community when there is an active discussion going on. </span></p>
              <p>Sometimes, retorting lionnoisy in his own manner really doesn't contribute much to military related discussions? (Sure is funny sometimes though! <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"> )For all we know, he could be enjoying all this attention that he's getting.</p>
              <p>So in the case of his oil-leak of American ships, he is arguing that American shipyards are not making reliable ships. Is that a valid argument? Then there is a matter "Why" and "So what?"</p>
              <p>Does it matter in anyway?  Perhaps maybe some considerations like, does it implicate Singapore's security because we are very dependent on the USN for regional security and stability?   Or would it benefit us, cos USN ships would have to stop over here and make use of our facilities?</p>
              <p>In anycase, this is a break from his usual Aussie bashing rhetorics. </p>

              <p>Actually it's another one of his "backside itchy" posts... after his heavy pwning he has been reluctant to do anything too drastic and this latest "oil leak" post is an attempt to let off some steam by implicating that some other country managed to foul up without getting too much a response... basically I am not sure lionnoisy makes threads for any other reason other then to promote Singapore and put down other nations.</p>
              <p>At best his posts are boring, and at worse they're insane.</p>

              <p>1. You must be kidding if you think the USS Freddom is not a stealthy ship. Have a look at the latest pics and stop posting up dodgy pics that aren't even of the USS Freedom.</p>
              <p>2. The USS Freedom is an LCS not a frigate! It is a different class of ship, so stop trying to blow sunshine up your arse by comparing it with the Formidables. The role of the LCS is to combat littoral environment threats not blue water.</p>
              <p>Yes it may have lower armament, but look at its advantages - two helicopters, ridiculously fast speed of 40+ knots, incredible flexibility, two docks to launch boats.</p>
              <p>It's been designed exactly for what it needs to do. Yes it operates independently when you consider its role ie. littoral environment. The US navy will rather use their destroyers for blue water.</p>
              <p>And yes, 24 hours to change modules is not a long time. In fact it's a very very good turnaround, so stop trying to make it some sort of issue as if the US is not combat ready just because it takes them a day to fit out their ship.</p>
              <p>Ask yourself, how long does it take SG to fit out a Formidable with food, fuel, missiles, torpedos, and etc? Dumbass lion.</p>

              <p>Dunno much.</p>
              <p>But such flexibility is not such a great advantage in combat. The ship can do it, can the crew do it, even with extra training? Even if the crew is interchangeable too, or can swop individuals suitable for the different roles, do you honestly think it will work?</p>
              <p>If I'm the crew I would call it a curse. And I'm sure the USN knows that.</p>
              <p>It is really more advantageous rather in costs. The same hull for different roles....why not?</p>

              <p>Which navy sends out singular ships without support in an actual battle? The USN does not do it, the RAN does not do it, and the RSN for sure does NOT do it. Our Formidibles are not supposed to operate on their own, nor are any of our ships. The exception to this rule is submarines, which work better on their own.</p>
              <p>But I am not surprised you put such a argument, given it seems that you have this very wrong idea about navies is that they send out single ships out to sea with no support in sight for thousands of miles.</p>

              <p>Does this look like the USN operates ships on their own as part of their SOP? When you hear of naval exercises do you hear about ship A vs ship B anytime, anyday or fleet vs fleet operations based on possible real world senariaos?</p>
              <p>And use your common sense, a fleet of LSCs configured for different mission profiles can protect each other, something you would have EASILY found out had you even bothered to read anyhing about the LCS:</p>
              <blockquote>
              <p>It is designed to be a <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">fast, maneuverable and networked</span></span></strong> surface combatant for missions such as mine warfare, anti-submarine warfare, surface warfare and humanitarian relief.</p>

              <p>What is your understanding of <strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">networked</span></strong>? That the USN will operate singular LCS will stray far out into the ocean to face anyday, anyhow enemies?</p>

              <p>Anyway,the frigate is not supposed to shot a missile few thousand away.</p>

              <p>Hate to burst your bubble lionnoisy, but the basic configuration of an LCS like the Independence OUTCLASSES our Formidible by a lot.</p>
              <p>Go compare the facts:</p>
              <blockquote>
              <p>The design for <em>Independence</em> (LCS 2) is based on a proven high-speed <a title="Trimaran" rel="nofollow" href="/wiki/Trimaran"><span style="TEXT-DECORATION: underline"><span style="COLOR: #0066cc">trimaran</span></span></a> hull built by <a title="Austal" rel="nofollow" href="/wiki/Austal"><span style="TEXT-DECORATION: underline"><span style="COLOR: #0066cc">Austal</span></span></a> (Henderson, Australia). <strong><span style="COLOR: #ff0000">The 127-meter surface combatant design calls for a crew of fewer than 40 sailors, while the trimaran hull should enable the ship to reach sustainable speeds of nearly 50 knots (60 mph/90 km/h) and range as far as 10,000 nautical miles (20,000 km).</span></strong></p>
              <p>With 11,000 cubic meters of payload volume the ship is designed with <strong><span style="COLOR: #ff0000">twice the objective payload and volume so that it can carry out one mission while a separate mission module is in reserve.</span></strong> The large flight deck, 1,030 square meters (11,100 sf), will support operation of <strong><span style="TEXT-DECORATION: underline"><span style="COLOR: #ff0000">two</span></span></strong> <a title="SH-60" rel="nofollow" href="/wiki/SH-60"><strong><span style="TEXT-DECORATION: underline"><span style="COLOR: #ff0000">SH-60</span></span></strong></a> <strong><span style="TEXT-DECORATION: underline"><span style="COLOR: #ff0000">helicopters</span></span></strong>, unmanned vehicles, or large <a title="CH-53" rel="nofollow" href="/wiki/CH-53"><span style="TEXT-DECORATION: underline"><span style="COLOR: #0066cc">CH-53</span></span></a> class helicopters. <span style="COLOR: #ff0000"><strong>The stable trimaran hull will allow flight operations in high sea conditions.</strong></span></p>
              <p>Fixed core capabilities will be carried for self-defense and command and control. However unlike traditional fighting ships with fixed armament such as guns and missiles, <span style="COLOR: #ff0000"><strong>innovative and tailored mission modules will be configured for one mission package at a time. Modules may consist of manned aircraft, unmanned vehicles, off-board sensors, or mission-manning detachments - all in an expandable</strong></span> <a title="Open systems architecture" rel="nofollow" href="/wiki/Open_systems_architecture"><span style="TEXT-DECORATION: underline"><span style="COLOR: #ff0000"><strong>open systems architecture</strong></span></span></a><span style="COLOR: #ff0000"><strong>.</strong></span></p>
              <p>The large interior volume and payload is <span style="COLOR: #ff0000"><strong>greater than larger destroyers and is sufficient to serve as a high-speed transport and maneuver platform.</strong></span> The mission bay is 11,800 square feet (1,100 m<sup>2</sup>), and takes up most of the deck below the hangar and flight deck.</p>
              <p>In addition to cargo or container-sized mission modules, <span style="COLOR: #ff0000"><strong>the bay can carry four lanes of multiple</strong></span> <a title="Stryker (vehicle)" rel="nofollow" href="/wiki/Stryker_(vehicle)"><span style="TEXT-DECORATION: underline"><span style="COLOR: #ff0000"><strong>Strykers</strong></span></span></a><span style="COLOR: #ff0000"><strong>, armored</strong></span> <a title="Humvee" rel="nofollow" href="/wiki/Humvee"><span style="TEXT-DECORATION: underline"><span style="COLOR: #ff0000"><strong>Humvees</strong></span></span></a><span style="COLOR: #ff0000"><strong>, and their associated troops.

              <p>And note the LCS 2 can do all this while actually being LIGHTER then our Formidable as well as <span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>twice as fast with greater range, twice the ASW helicopter capacity as well as supporting other aircraft our Formidable does not have. It</strong></span> <span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>is also capable of carrying out RO/RO and transport operations that our Formidable cannot do.</strong></span></p>
