              <p>Did i say no RCS at all?NO!!I just say REDUCE.</p>
              <p>Just to reduce RCS!!Not 100% stealth.</p>
              <p>Will less window reduce RCS?Yes.</p>
              <p>Will no bitts on decks reduce RCS?yes.</p>
              <p>These all just a small things which SG can do to reduce RCS.</p>
              <p>We cant afford to spend billions just on one ship</p>
              <p>to be so called Stealth ship.We wont use a fancy name</p>
              <p>to build a new class of ship.</p>

              <p>does it matter ?</p>
              <p>it matters on a stealth ship, but does it matter on a normal, ship with no RAM or special design to reduce RCS ?</p>
              <p>the fearless class, whether clean or not clean , wont have any discernable impact on RCS.</p>
              <p>its like saying, black paint on the F15 will make it stealth and offer it stealth capabilities like the F117 (now retired) or the F22 and the B2 spirit.</p>
              <p>if something is not inherently designed for stealth, with its superstructure and engineering not specifically tailored for stealth operation, no amount of tweaking will make it stealth.</p>
              <p>but then again, its futile to explain this to you. you probably will continue on your unlogic and mindless ranting until you irk enough people and the mod comes in to censor / delete your post.</p>
              <p>now you shifting on to bigger things eh ? attacking the yanks for stealth ships ? FYI, american LCS can hit high speeds, offer modularity for different roles/functions/flexibility. lets not forget something.</p>
              <p>the americans have had stealth ships before you were even born lionnoisy. so please, give some credit when its due.</p>
              <p>http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sea_Shadow</p>
              <p>they are pioneers in the field of reduced RCS and RAM for naval vessels.</p>

              <p>Thank you for the clarification, sg stars.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Lionnoisy defines stealth as totally invisible on radar.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>What kind of bullshit is that? The definition of stealth is not totally invisible on radar, you dumbass.</p>
              <p>It is a given that this is not always a possibility. Stealth refers to the active attempt to reducing detectability.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>And where did you get your info that reducing windows improves stealth?</p>
              <p>Where did you get your info that reducing bits on deck improves stealth?</p>
              <p>The science of stealth is a lot more complicated than you think. </p>
              <p>I give you the example of Formula 1 where adding bits to the car can sometimes improve it. Therefore it is possible that adding bits to a ship can actually improve its stealth and not decrease it.</p>

              <p>im sure your eyes can see stealth.</p>
              <p>but radar technology is not that sensitive that it can detect small sampans/boats. you must understand some fundamentals behind radar technology,</p>
              <p>1) radar depends on reflected waves.<br>2) the waves bounce back and are picked up by the radar.<br>3) there are plenty of signals out there in the SEA.

              <p>Retired Admiral James Lyons had a <a href="http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2009/feb/01/ship-shopping-list/">piece up in the Washington Times</a> on Sunday.</p>
              <p>The whole thing is worth a read, particularly:</p>
              <blockquote>
              <p>The overall costs of the LCS are largely driven by the
              speed requirement of 50 knots. It can be safely assumed that between 30
              percent and 40 percent of the current hull, mechanical and electrical
              (HM&amp;E) costs are directly attributed to the speed requirement. It
              is not transparently clear what a 50 knot capability (as opposed to 30
              knots) confers in the threat today of Mach 1-plus air and surface
              launched guided-stealthy missiles plus 70-plus-knot torpedoes.
              Furthermore, in any type of seaway, the ship will not operate at 50
              knots nor will it operate at 50 knots in 20 feet of water unless the
              intention is to dig a trench in the seabed.</p>
              </blockquote>
              <p>and</p>
              <blockquote>
              <p>In the bid to reduce weight (for speed) both designs
              include significant amounts of aluminum, but little or no composites in
              their superstructure. One is almost all aluminum. We continue to ignore
              the lessons drawn from the Falklands war where British ships with
              aluminum superstructures burned to the gunwales in a littoral sea fight
              with Argentine aircraft-delivered iron bombs and French short-range
              Exocet missiles. Perhaps we should review the logic presented in the
              mid-1980s when we opted for an all-steel Arleigh Burke DDG-51 destroyer.</p>
              </blockquote>
              <p>Murdoc was once a rather strong LCS supporter, but that was when
              they were cheap and on schedule. That has changed, and so has my belief
              that this is a good program. Certainly no DD(X), but not something I
              want our Navy to hang its future capability on, either. Adm. Lyons
              suggests something along the lines of the Norwegian and Spanish Aegis
              frigates, and I’ve often asked “where is the 21st century FFG-7?”</p>
              <p>Claims that the LCS are important to keeping the Navy in the fight
              against today’s terrorism and piracy don’t really hold a lot of water
              with me. The aircraft carrier is still the heavy hitter in nearly any
              environment, and if we’re talking swarms of smaller surface combatants
              or dangerous littoral operations, shouldn’t we be talking about
              corvettes and PT boats rather than $550 million light destroyers?</p>

              <blockquote>
              <p>The Navy’s first littoral combat ship, the Freedom, has
              only been in commission for a little more than three months, but
              contractors are already aspiring to add new boats and accessories to go
              with the “pickup truck” warship.</p>
              <p>Defense giants Lockheed Martin and Northrop Grumman each used the
              mid-January Surface Navy Association symposium outside Washington to
              showcase designs for experimental, modular boats that could potentially
              deploy from an LCS close to shore and venture up shallow lakes and
              rivers.</p>

              <p>Now,
              Murdoc’s on record as supporting the idea of a true battleship (or even
              a monitor-type bombardment ship) for the fleet. But even if we were to
              get such a fine ship, it wouldn’t fill many of the roles the LCS is
              intended for.</p>
              <p>Build some BBs. Bring them on. But I really think a small
              corvette/cutter type ship would do more for the US Navy in today’s wars

              <p><em><a title="James Lyons" href="http://www.washingtontimes.com/themes/?Theme=James+Lyons">''James Lyons</a>, U.S. Navy retired admiral, was commander in chief of the <a title="U.S. Pacific Fleet" href="http://www.washingtontimes.com/themes/?Theme=U.S.+Pacific+Fleet">U.S. Pacific Fleet</a>,''helps me to prove that</em></p>
              <p>1.<em>LCS is NOT so stealth.</em></p>
              <p>2.<em>Also,</em>he said the umbrella concept cant work.</p>
              <p>Sg Ty once mentioned the umbrella concept can give LCS full protection.</p>
              <p>http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2009/feb/01/ship-shopping-list/</p>
              <blockquote>
              <p>Despite the stated requirement for <span style="color: #ff0000;">stealth,</span> it is not optimized in
                  either of the LCS prototypes. Both ships display relatively large radar
                  targets. The mono-hull (<a title="Lockheed Martin Corporation" href="http://www.washingtontimes.com/themes/?Theme=Lockheed+Martin+Corporation">Lockheed</a>) is derived from a fast yacht hull form and unsurprisingly, stealth was not an important consideration. The trimaran variant (<a title="General Dynamics Corporation" href="http://www.washingtontimes.com/themes/?Theme=General+Dynamics+Corporation">General Dynamics</a>) provides a radar "tunnel" to amplify the radar return from the ship when observed from certain aspects.</p>
              <p>Moreover, both hull forms have inherent large and/or noisy acoustic
                  signatures. Further, both prototypes will have predictability large
                  infrared signatures when operating at higher speeds. Neither of these
                  prototypes has anything but a very limited "point" air defense
                  capability. In today's expanding threat environment, any ship designed
                  to be a 21st-century warship is fatally flawed that costs more than
                  $550 million and does not incorporate multiple fire-control systems and
                  a reasonable area air defense capability against stealthy cruise
                  missiles. The argument that an air defense<span style="color: #ff0000;"> "umbrella"</span> for the LCS will
                  be provided by other air and surface platforms is suspect, if only
                  because the LCS is touted as a precursor weapons system, intended to
                  "sanitize" littoral waters.</p>
