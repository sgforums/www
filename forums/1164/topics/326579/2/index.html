              <p>In fact, it seems that the only reason you are trying to bash the LCS is because you need to find something to feel good about the RSN instead of having any real logical case to make against it.</p>
              <p>This is not too unlike the kind of people we meet who criticise other systems not because they are really flawed, but because they few threatened that these things will be better or more popular then what they like. Your nonsense in the SAR-21 vs Tavor thread, and now here, is pretty much a shining example of that.</p>

              <p>An anti-mine LCS is not going to be operating alone without conventional cover from ASW or conventionally configured ships. The idea, which seems to be lost out on you not because it's hard to understand but because you just insist on trying to turn white to black and ending up not only failing that but making yourself look bad, is that the LCS was intended to be a platform that can be configured to multiple tasks, greatly saving on operating costs as well as affording flexibility instead of having to cart in multiple ships of different classes for one role.</p>

              <p>Yeah, I concur. That's exactly what I said, too. LCS gives flexibility. It's not meant to be some 'supership'.</p>

              <p>For some reason lionnoisy makes a big who-ha when the Yanks take this technology further and actually implement hulls that can be configured as an when they are needed in short order. But oh wait, he's more known for having more noise then knowledge on the subject matter.</p>
              <p>What is funnier is that he's trying to paint this as a major disadvantage of the class when by any measure it is actually its strongest point. As opposed to having to constantly operate ships of differing types or finding a shortfall in certain hull classes when a certain need arises, the USN can now configure it's flexible hulls to tailor to their needs as and when they need, allowing them force-to-task-suitability that is otherwise not possible with having multiple redundant ship types.</p>
              <p>What is pure comedy he misses out the entire point of the concept and instead relies soley on his "what if, anyday, anytime" a single lone LCS faces a task that it is not configured for?</p>
              <p>Might as well ask the same question of our Formidible frigates. What if one day, "anyday, anytime" our Formidibles find themselves in a minefield and realize that they are not an anti-mining ship?</p>
              <p>What rubbish.</p>
              <p>Oh I am sure the largest navy in the world with the biggest budget and most powerful sensor network would somehow send out lone littorial ships with absolutely no support whatsoever to get surprised by the enemy.</p>
              <p>The greater rubbish is that he tries to say that 24 hours to change the ship's role is too much due to how "quickly" war can break out. Not only does he not explain how on earth this war is breaking out, he simply assumes as he does before, that mysterous stealth ships and planes will suddenly appear out of nowhere and show the "unsuitability" of whatever system he happens to fix his illogical gaze upon.</p>
              <p>Seriously... which power in the world is going to try to "surprise" the USN? And which navy goes to war within 24 hours? To sail the fleet to any location takes months of prep in harbour as well as actual sailing to location. If the LCS is going to war, the USN would have had plenty of time to prepare it for the intended task.</p>
              <p>Might as well say that all citizens in Singapore need to have a SAR-21 by their side at all times because "anyday, anytime" war can break out and going to our camps and drawing our weapons will take too much time.</p>
              <p>Seriously, this guy is totally pwned in here.</p>

              <p>You talk so much about needing to be on the spot all the time and no time taken to change stuff, but do you even have any idea how many days it actually takes to reach the spot? There is more then enough time to change the module of the ship in safe waters.</p>
              <p>What makes you think that the USN will not operate a significant number of different LCS types in the first place? The main advantage of this system is that it allows in field changes of ship roles, a task that is previously impossible if you sail into the area (which will take days anyway)</p>

              <p>Trying to invent problems again?</p>
              <p>Unfortunately while you try to spout problems, in reality these are already issues that are long solved.</p>
              <p>Do you know that in practice the refit and resupply of SSNs in war will actually take place out in the open sea with submarine tenders instead of having to sail back to port?</p>
              <p>Obviously the issues with refitting and resupplying ships out at sea have how been solved since the USN started doing this decades back. What is an LCS modules and crew transfer to them?</p>
              <p>An LCS module is chicken feet as opposed to the task of needing to load explosive ADCAPS and Harpoons onto a low-in-the-water SSN as opposed to a surface combatant.</p>
              <p>You are just trying to invent problems. I might as well say our SAR-21's reliance on batteries means that it's useless in the field once bad weather prevents the SAF from supplying us with our AA batteries to let our LADs work.</p>

              <p>What makes you think the AA ships can't work? Suddenly get a lionnoisy computer virus?</p>
              <p>Isn't the same logic going to apply to our own Formidibles if you want to mysteriously dream up nonsense problems for the LCS?</p>
              <p>Our Formidibles are not a picture of true flexibility, it is a jack of all trades but master of none. Basically put the problem with multi-role ships of such small tonnage is that you are trying to cram multiple different roles into a single hull, meaning that in battle the Formidible actually only brings 1/3 of it's tonnage to put out into firepower into any given role at any one time while a specialized LCS can put in far more.</p>
              <p>This is not flexibility, but simply old fashioned design. Our Formidibles are practically useless when faced with other forms of warfare such as anti-mine, but the LCS can simply be configured to that role.</p>

              <p>Really, so how come your stand in Speaker's Corner is not to challange authority? What a big joke.</p>
              <p>The biggest block for lionnoisy being to advance is not to use good logic and facts.</p>
              <p>If you want to convince people that the LCS is such a bad idea, then use logic and facts to do it.</p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>So how come so far all your logic and facts have produced things like ships needing to teleport to areas of trouble at any given time, launching F-18s off "mini-cvs", crashing FANTAIL into things, carrying SAR-21 by one handle in battle like a handbag and inline skate force?</strong></span></p>
              <p>LOL</p>
              <p>So you think the USN is going to operate LCS without any configuration at all times until times of war? I think you're not thinking at all.</p>
              <p>Basically and I say this again, the LCS is supposed to give the USN an inexpensive, littorial ship to operate with the capacity to change its roles as and when needed to reduce on having redundant hull types or needing to build more ships to fufill a specialized role.</p>
              <p>If you don't want to accept this or think it's an unworkable concept for the simple reason the RSN or ST does not have it and it's threatening the imaginary popularity or "superiority" of the small brown water navy of a certain island nation then it's really your loss, you are the one who needs to constantly decieve yourself and remain blind and ignorant, choosing only to see the world through the "anything SAF does is good and if other militaries perform better or have better ideas they are flawed and stupid ideas because I need to feel good about my own SAF" glasses.</p>
              <p>Obviously all this is lost out on you who sits in one corner sucking your lollipop and repeating the same, debunked and lously points over and over again.</p>
              <p>I don't think the USN makes good choices all the time, but quite obviously, their rate of making good choices far exceeds your own, lionnoisy.</p>

              <p><strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">Degaussing</span></strong></p>
              <p><strong>Degaussing</strong> is the process of decreasing or eliminating an unwanted <a title="Magnetic field" href="http://sgforums.com/wiki/Magnetic_field"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0066cc;">magnetic field</span></span></a>. It is named after <a title="Carl Friedrich Gauss" href="http://sgforums.com/wiki/Carl_Friedrich_Gauss"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0066cc;">Carl Friedrich Gauss</span></span></a>, an early researcher in the field of <a title="Magnetism" href="http://sgforums.com/wiki/Magnetism"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0066cc;">magnetism</span></span></a>. Due to <a class="mw-redirect" title="Magnetic hysteresis" href="http://sgforums.com/wiki/Magnetic_hysteresis"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0066cc;">magnetic hysteresis</span></span></a> it is generally not possible to reduce a magnetic field completely to zero, so degaussing typically induces a very small "known" field referred to as <strong>bias</strong>.</p>
              <p><span class="mw-headline">Degaussing ship's hulls</span></p>
              <p>The term was first used by (then) Cmdr. <a title="Charles F. Goodeve" href="http://sgforums.com/wiki/Charles_F._Goodeve"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0066cc;">Charles F. Goodeve</span></span></a>, <a title="Royal Canadian Naval Volunteer Reserve" href="http://sgforums.com/wiki/Royal_Canadian_Naval_Volunteer_Reserve"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0066cc;">RCNVR</span></span></a>, during <a title="World War II" href="http://sgforums.com/wiki/World_War_II"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0066cc;">World War II</span></span></a> while trying to counter the German <a class="mw-redirect" title="Magnetic mine" href="http://sgforums.com/wiki/Magnetic_mine"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0066cc;">magnetic mines</span></span></a> that were playing havoc with the British fleet. The mines detected the increase in magnetic field when the steel in a ship concentrated the Earth's magnetic field over it. Goodeve developed a number of systems to induce a small "N-pole up" field into the ship to offset this effect, meaning that the net field was the same as background. Since the Germans used the <a title="Gauss (unit)" href="http://sgforums.com/wiki/Gauss_(unit)"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0066cc;">gauss</span></span></a> as the unit of the strength of the magnetic field in their mines' triggers (this was not yet a standard measure), Goodeve referred to the various processes to counter the mines as degaussing. The term became a common word.</p>
              <p>The original method of degaussing was to install electromagnetic coils into the ships, known simply as <strong>coiling</strong>. In addition to being able to continually bias the ship, coiling also allowed the bias field to be reversed in the southern hemisphere, where the mines were set to detect "S-pole down" fields. British ships, notably <a title="Cruiser" href="http://sgforums.com/wiki/Cruiser"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0066cc;">cruisers</span></span></a> and <a title="Battleship" href="http://sgforums.com/wiki/Battleship"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0066cc;">battleships</span></span></a>, were well protected by about <a title="1943" href="http://sgforums.com/wiki/1943"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0066cc;">1943</span></span></a>.</p>
              <p>Installing such special equipment was, however, far too expensive and difficult to service all ships that would need it, so the navy developed an alternative called <strong>wiping</strong> (devised by Goodeve), which simply dragged a large electrical cable along the side of the ship with about 2000 amps flowing through it. This induced the proper field into the ship in the form of a slight bias. It was originally thought that the pounding of the sea and the ship's engines would slowly randomize this field, but in testing this was found not to be a real problem. A more serious problem was later realized: as a ship travels through the Earth's magnetic field it will slowly pick up that field, counteracting the effects of the degaussing. From then on captains were instructed to change direction as often as possible to avoid this problem. Nevertheless the bias did wear off eventually, and ships had to be degaussed on a schedule. Smaller ships continued to use wiping through the war.</p>

              </div>
              <p>After the war the capabilities of the magnetic fuses were greatly improved, by detecting not the field itself, but <em>changes</em> in it. This meant a degaussed ship with a magnetic "hot spot" would still set off the mine. Additionally, the precise orientation of the field was also measured, something a simple bias field could not remove, at least for all points on the ship. A series of ever-increasingly complex coils were introduced to offset these effects, with modern systems including no fewer than three separate sets of coils to reduce the field in all axes.</p>

              <p>u will tell me this is USN .Their fighting concept is different.</p>
              <p>Well.U may be right.Then u need other ship or ships to protect</p>

              <p>Whe u get the flexbility of changing fighting modules,</p>
              <p>dunt forget the other restrictions,ie must go in a group.</p>

              <p>Which navy sends out singular ships without support in an actual battle? The USN does not do it, the RAN does not do it, and the RSN for sure does NOT do it. Our Formidibles are not supposed to operate on their own, nor are any of our ships. The exception to this rule is submarines, which work better on their own.</p>
              <p>But I am not surprised you put such a argument, given it seems that you have this very wrong idea about navies is that they send out single ships out to sea with no support in sight for thousands of miles.</p>
              <p><img src="http://patdollard.com/wp-content/uploads/lincoln-group.jpg" alt="" width="1273" height="852"></p>
              <p>Does this look like the USN operates ships on their own as part of their SOP? When you hear of naval exercises do you hear about ship A vs ship B anytime, anyday or fleet vs fleet operations based on possible real world senariaos?</p>
              <p>And use your common sense, a fleet of LSCs configured for different mission profiles can protect each other, something you would have EASILY found out had you even bothered to read anyhing about the LCS:</p>
              <blockquote>
              <p>It is designed to be a <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">fast, maneuverable and networked</span></span></strong> surface combatant for missions such as mine warfare, anti-submarine warfare, surface warfare and humanitarian relief.</p>
              </blockquote>
              <p>What is your understanding of <strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">networked</span></strong>? That the USN will operate singular LCS will stray far out into the ocean to face anyday, anyhow enemies?</p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>If the Singapore table tennis team plays like you make your posts in here, they will lose all their games 0-11, and then they'll make excuses like being "layman" or the like. Maybe you need to learn something from them called "honest and proper hard work" and not just make many useless and pointless posts and try to pass off your laziness to actually make a proper argument as "fighting spirit".</strong></span></p>

              <p>Of course it's okay. Do you seriously think that the USN, with the MOST experience in the world refitting ships out at sea. But use your common sense, you don't always have to refit the ships at sea, the nearest friendly dock is always a possibility.</p>
              <p>The main advantage of modular ships are strategic, not tactical. This means that the USN has the ability to configure their fleet and project force for takes in timeframes not previously possibile as well as doing it at far less cost. Try seeing the forrest and not the trees son.</p>
              <p>And why your constant harping on bad weather and rough seas? I don't see you making the same argument about our Victory class ships that are poorly equipped to handle rough seas and bad weather compared to other surface combatants? Why? The sun only shines for the RSN ah?</p>
              <p>Unfortunately for you, you seem to think a lot of things are not ok but then they still turn out ok.</p>

              <p>You still haven't answered on degaussing for mines, why you ask if metal hulls are okay when degaussing has been around since WW2?</p>
              <p>Interestingly how come you are also quiet on the fact that despite being in the same weight class, the LCS is significantly faster then the our Formidable frigates? Our Formidable can only max out at 27 knots while the LCS can go up to 50, which is nearly twice as fast.</p>
              <p>Never do your homework and think you can anyhow ask questions rite?</p>

              <p>Oh wait, you forgot to mention about LCS 2 as well:</p>
              <blockquote>
              <p>The design for <em>Independence</em> (LCS 2) is based on a proven high-speed <a title="Trimaran" href="/wiki/Trimaran"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0066cc;">trimaran</span></span></a> hull built by <a title="Austal" href="/wiki/Austal"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0066cc;">Austal</span></span></a> (Henderson, Australia). <strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">The 127-meter surface combatant design calls for a crew of fewer than 40 sailors, while the trimaran hull should enable the ship to reach sustainable speeds of nearly 50 knots (60 mph/90 km/h) and range as far as 10,000 nautical miles (20,000 km).</span></strong></p>
              <p>With 11,000 cubic meters of payload volume the ship is designed with <strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">twice the objective payload and volume so that it can carry out one mission while a separate mission module is in reserve.</span></strong> The large flight deck, 1,030 square meters (11,100 sf), will support operation of <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">two </span></span></strong><a class="mw-redirect" title="SH-60" href="/wiki/SH-60"><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">SH-60</span></span></strong></a><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #ff0000;"> helicopters</span></span></strong>, unmanned vehicles, or large <a class="mw-redirect" title="CH-53" href="/wiki/CH-53"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0066cc;">CH-53</span></span></a> class helicopters. <span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>The stable trimaran hull will allow flight operations in high sea conditions.</strong></span></p>
              <p>Fixed core capabilities will be carried for self-defense and command and control. However unlike traditional fighting ships with fixed armament such as guns and missiles, <span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>innovative and tailored mission modules will be configured for one mission package at a time. Modules may consist of manned aircraft, unmanned vehicles, off-board sensors, or mission-manning detachments - all in an expandable </strong></span><a title="Open systems architecture" href="/wiki/Open_systems_architecture"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>open systems architecture</strong></span></span></a><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>.</strong></span></p>
              <p>The large interior volume and payload is <span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>greater than larger destroyers and is sufficient to serve as a high-speed transport and maneuver platform.</strong></span> The mission bay is 11,800 square feet (1,100 m<sup>2</sup>), and takes up most of the deck below the hangar and flight deck.</p>
              <p>In addition to cargo or container-sized mission modules, <span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>the bay can carry four lanes of multiple </strong></span><a class="mw-redirect" title="Stryker (vehicle)" href="/wiki/Stryker_(vehicle)"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>Strykers</strong></span></span></a><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>, armored </strong></span><a class="mw-redirect" title="Humvee" href="/wiki/Humvee"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>Humvees</strong></span></span></a><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>, and their associated troops. An elevator allows air transport of packages the size of a </strong></span><a title="Twenty-foot equivalent unit" href="/wiki/Twenty-foot_equivalent_unit"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>twenty-foot long shipping container</strong></span></span></a><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong> that can be moved into the mission bay while at sea. A side access ramp allows for vehicle </strong></span><a title="Roll-on/roll-off" href="/wiki/Roll-on/roll-off"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>roll-on/roll-off</strong></span></span></a><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong> loading to a dock.</strong></span> The habitability area is under the bridge with bunks for many personnel.</p>
              </blockquote>
              <p>And note the LCS 2 can do all this while actually being LIGHTER then our Formidable as well as twice as fast with greater range, twice the ASW helicopter capacity as well as supporting other aircraft our Formidable does not have. It is also capable of carrying out RO/RO and transport operations that our Formidable cannot do.</p>
