            <div class='col-md body'>this is what my sources tell me<br><br><blockquote>Thanks!<br><br>Guys here are waiting for the photos<img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>In Poland there is a discussion now - buy more Leopards 2A4 or buy PT-91M (or modernise existing the youngest T-72 to PT-91M). PT-91 is much worse that PT-91M version.<br><br>regards,<br><br>T.M.</blockquote>the comment by the polish officers about pt-91 (few years ago) were true the PT-91 (not PT-91M) were crappy..so the poland government were in the dilemma wether to buy a new leo or proceed with the upgrade (bulma labedy have proposed extensive upgrades for the pt-91m). But unfortunately the modernisation of the twardy cost money so they shelved it.<br><br>But when the malaysian inquiry and later select this tank and gave a very strict requirement for the tank upgrade...its like a dream came true for the poland gov. It means they can proceed the design development of the PT-91M using the malay money. So the PT-91M were in fact a new upgraded package alltogether.<br><br>Now the thing is there are people in Poland who wants to proceed with the more modern PT91M type tank (probably redesignated a different name) and there is another group who think it is cheaper just to buy the leo(which is very good tank especially if upgraded).<br><br>but most of the polish were not that eager working with the german and consider them a potential enemy. thats about it.<br><br><blockquote>About Panzerfaust-3 tests,<br>Germans wanted to sell the Panzerfaust-3T something about year 2000 - polish land forces should have a next generation antitank grenade launcher. For RPG-7 there are some new tandem warheads with 500 RHA (cover by ERA) but not sold to forces yet (manufacturer site - http://www.dezamet.com.pl/dezamet/plakat11b/plakat10.html ).<br>Of course, Russians have their new warheads for RPG. Especially specialist say that RPG-7VR was the version of weapon used againg this ABRAMS tank, that was penetrated of both sides (http://www.altair.com.pl/files/r1203_abrams.htm). So MoD guys organized with Germans the tests of PF-3T, they cowered steel with ERAWA-2, and it was shoot from several angles.  Germans claimed PF-3T to be able to penetrate 1000RHA behind ERA. After thest it appeared that half of it was achieved, 500 mm penetration in the steel. But there are also some mysteries with those tets - some of the bricks did not explode, yet it protected the steel. <span style="color: blue;">Anyway, Polish Land Forces did not buy the Panzerfausts, although this kind of weapon is very necessary - on west border we have Germans with amazing Leo2A6, Leo2A4, on easter border we have Belaruss and Russia, with thousands of T-80 and Poland cannot spent the same money as the Germans, and unfortunately does not have so weapon industry in very different areas. We have a peace now, but relations with Russia gets a little worse, and Germans now start to want some of their lands back. Who can images what can happen in 15 years. </span>So effective grenade lauchers are very needed, especially with some programable amunition. As i read some military analyzis from polish land forces, they want to introduce a new kind of RPG successor with about 1000 meters range.</blockquote>Wether they proceed with twardy developmen or leo is unknown yet. But my friend says it depend on the second tank regiment that the malay are forming. If they equip that with PT-91M he thin the poland will choose to proceed with the twardy.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>It is old news abt the Polish decision as stated by a Pole it is matter of nationalisation or Leopardization.<br><br>If it is for political reason then go for upgrade of those old T-72.<br><br>But it it is military,reason, then Leo 2 wins hand down.<br><br>Reasons are:<br><br>1) Getting the firesales ex-German warstock Leo 2A4 ( &lt; USD1m per unit) is actually much cheaper than to upgrades the T-72M1.<br><br>2) T-72 and PT-91 suspension are crap as compare to Leo2A4, likewise for PT-91M becos there is no upgrades done for it as well.<br><br>3) PT-91M has no opportunity to further upgrades of it's armour as it has reached the weight limitation for the T-72 design whereas Leo2A4 is designed to be able to handle even higher weight, from 55tons of A4 to 62tons A6, and A6M should be even higher due to more armour upgrades.<br><br>4) The infamous popping turret still exist in the T-72 and all it's variant including PT-91M( no upgrade could solve this unless you change the whole turret), the reason is the crammed turret where tank ammo are stored all over the turret, whereas the roomy Leo2 turret not only much more comfortable for the crew, all it's ammo is compartmentalised so lesser the chance of popping turret like T-72 that make it infamous in GW1.<br><br>5) The L44 is gun and ammo is already much better than in any T-72 variant, if you need better gun for Leo 2, you could still install the best tank gun in the world currently, the L55 gun.<br><br>For more info read this thread:<br><br><a href="http://www.militaryphotos.net/forums/showthread.php?t=86408" rel="nofollow">http://www.militaryphotos.net/forums/showthread.php?t=86408</a><br><br>As for the original thread in the Polish forum abt Leo 2 vs PT-91 , this is the thread, btw in Polish:<br><br><a href="http://www.nfow.pl/viewtopic.php?t=4022&amp;postdays=0&amp;postorder=asc&amp;start=15" rel="nofollow">http://www.nfow.pl/viewtopic.php?t=4022&amp;postdays=0&amp;postorder=asc&amp;start=15</a><br><br>So in reality, I think what your friend said is full of BS, regardless whether MY buy more PT-91M or not, becos getting ex-German warstock Leo 2A4 is still much cheaper than upgrading the T-72M1 to PT-91M and Leo 2A4 is much better than PT91M for some of the reasons I have given above!!!</div>

Not even the vaunted M1HA claims that.<br><br>Anything under 1000meters pose a threat, frontal arc or not.<br><br>So the question is not just on armor versus projectile.  First, its a challenge of the sensor suite, and the capability rapidly engage.  Western Tanks like the M1, Leo2s, and Challenger 2 wins hands down in these comparison so far.<br><br>And I would like to state, RPGs are not Mere popguns.  Those are indeed combat proven tank killers. Every tanker learns to respect that or face the fiery consequences.  If you're exposed to a T-72 from the front, 1000 meters, and an RPG, to the side, less than 200meters, which is a bigger threat?  Even money says the gunner would engage the RPG first.<br><br>Then we talk about crew survivability.  Tanks can be cheaply replaced compared to human lives.  Since GW1, we see how catastrophic failures commonly occur in Iraqi T-72s, T-55.  Why?  Because ammunition is not stowed separately and safely.  You think any of those guys got out alive?  Heh.<br><br>Test footage have shown that the compartmented ammunition storage in the Western Tanks such as Leo2s, can protect a crew from hellish ammo explosions.<br><br>Given a face off between the Leo2 and the PT-91M, my bet goes with the Leo2.</div>

There is at least one account, reported in the following Gulf War's US Official Assessment (scan), of an Abrams being damaged by three kinetic energy piercing rounds. The DoD report indicates that witnesses in the field claimed it was hit by a T-72 Asad Babil. The KE rounds were unable to fully penetrate and stuck in the armor, but because of the external damage it was sent to a maintenance depot. This is the only verified case of an M1A1 put out of action by an Iraqi MBT.[4]<br><br>Presumably the impacts set the storage boxes on fire. The tests at the impact point indicate the sabot shells were conventional, since no radiological trace was found there.<br><br>Other six M1As were allegedly hit by 125 mm tank fire in the Gulf war official report, but the impacts were largely ineffectual.........................<br><br>The most lopsided achievement of the M1A2s was the destruction of seven T-72 Lion of Babylon tanks in a point-blank skirmish (less than 50 yards) near Mahmoudiyah, about 18 miles south of Baghdad, with no losses for the American side (not surprisingly as a <strong>T-72 is unable to penetrate Abrams front and side</strong>).<br></blockquote>So far M1 is almost invincible when encountering T-72 even at range of 50y ards, is our Leo 2 has same level of protection?<br><br>Here some estiimates:<br><a href="http://members.tripod.com/collinsj/protect.htm" rel="nofollow">http://members.tripod.com/collinsj/protect.htm</a><br><br>Currently, based on the above estimates, our LeoA4 should have protection level similar to M1A1HA.<br><br>And if we uparmoured our Leo 2 to A5 standard, should have similar protection to M1A2SEP!!!<br><br>All are estimates, true or not  dun ask me but I will not surprised that the Leo2 and M1 have similar protection level, and if I am a betting man, I will bet on Leo 2  to win any time regardlss whether ERA protected T-72M1(PT-91M) or any new ammo for the 125mm gun!!!<br></div>
