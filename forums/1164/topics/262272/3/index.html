They also in the process of implementing BMS... right now their tankee are waiting for the PT91 so that all will fill up. But even the PT91M main purpose is to create a nukleaus of officers and tankee so that in the future these man could train and redesign the MAF armoured doctrine. So i guess rigt now no one should be worry much about the MAF CAD.</div>

Open your eyes big and read it one more time:  <span style="color: darkred;"><strong>Hopefully these tanks will not leak in water, like those in which ex-president Habibe purchased out-dated World War II tanks from Germany.</strong></span><br><br>In my earlier posting, I mentioned 2 issues.  The lst one concerned M'sia's intention to acquire tanks from Poland.  The other was about Habibe who most of us know him to be an Indonesian, procuring German tanks from Germany.<br><br>For the millions who live in S.E. Asian countries and who have been reading newspapers often and seeing Habibe's face on tv during Suharto's time, we alll know him to be an Indonesian.  There can be no mistake about Habibe's nationality.  You youself appear to be 'very blur'<br><br>Many of us who are living outside Indonesia are also aware that Habibe was adopted by President Suharto's family, when he was a young boy.  In his adult life, Habibe spent some time in Germany and was trained there as an Engineer.<br><br>For the time he spent in Germany, Habibe thought he had a good deal when he settled on a fleet of dyfunctional German tanks from Germany.  unfortunately some of them were found to have leaked in water.<br><br></div>
