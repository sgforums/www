            <div class='col-md body'>Penetration of the 30mm is 50% or 100% more than that of a 25 mm. I forgot which one.  Either way it's a lot better in terms of performance.<br><br>Giving my opinion on our Apaches.<br><br>The thing is not only are heli-pilots rare stuff (and the constant vibration has long term detrimental injury to your joints), we do not use AHs the way the US does...IE a hunting pack of X choppers.<br><br>I think we deploy AHs to go after higher priced targets/delay enemy counterattacks and slow enemy advance as ours work mainly in pairs to make full use of the Longbow radar.  Basically if we do that, we blunt their offense, keep them off balance even when we are still regrouping and are vunerable.<br><br>===<br>With regards to the A-10 thunderbolt, the general consensus is that the current planes are a "nice to have" for the US since they are flying so well.  If they really feel the A-10's crucial, they would have restarted the production line.  Dont forget that the A-10s are old and are without replacement. Not to mention , like all heavy armoured attack aircraft, AA missiles are a threat - since agility/speed/mobility is limited, you have to rely purely on your defense system to handle them.<br><br>The idea of a "Spectre" style Gunship would cost alot of $$$ and generate more whining from the neighbours than what's it's worth. I rather we have more SPHs that can do a less risky but equally painful job.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by SpecOps87:</div><div class="quote_body">Moca/Chino...whats your view on the use of A-10s to supplement our Apache tank killers?<br><br>Also...in-case somebody comes and kpkb say think of logistical costs and what not...I offer alternate solution with what we already have...the C130 converted to the Spectre gunship config. </div></blockquote>The A-10's UNIQUE role, if I am not wrong, is that of a dedicated tank buster. It has the ability to linger, take punishment, fly at a "relak-satu" pace and kill AFV with its gatling gun.<br><br>Its other role of aerial bombing, rocketing, firing guided munitions etc can also be fulfilled by any existing conventional fighter/bomber with equal effectiveness.<br><br>Again, I say the same thing: We already have more F-16's than MAF have MBTs. Do we need another dedicated tank killer?<br><br>IMHO, even if money/logistics is not a problem, we should get more dual role fighter/bombers like the F-16 instead of a purely dedicated tank-buster aircraft.<br><br>A fighter/bomber may stand a chance against enemy fighters and AA missiles. An A-10 less so (as I just noticed CM06 has also mentioned).<br><br>...<br><br>There must be good reasons why the A-10 is a one-off. No new A-10's are being procured and no new replacement for the A-10 is in line.<br><br>I think that as things stand, we already have enough assets to deal with enemy armour from the air already.<br><br>If we're really pressed, re-activate the Super Skyhawks - they are almost like the A-10 minus the gatling gun and armour. Definitely one of the best attack aircrafts every built.<br><br>...<br><br>C-130 Spectre Gunship idea is good if you have a lot of spare C-130s, which we don't. Also, C-130 Gunship role can be accomplished by existing fighter/bombers - which also stand a better chance of evading AA missiles and defending itself from enemy aircrafts than the gunship. We are not fighting jungle VCs.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>In brief, what happened? Or was it circumstantial? Nothing is immune. However, it is better to have the Apaches then not having it; especially with air-power on your side. As a matter of fact, more and more countries are buying attack helicopters. Has the Apache combat helicoptet failed in it`s objective when the US built/used it? Ans:No. It has fulfilled it`s original objectives.<br><br>Recently, I read about an ingenious device which can be equipped on a combat helicopter. It functions like the Trophy system(concept-wise but not execution) in that it releases miniture rockets which will eject a net at any projectile fired at it. The net will then capture the projectile and due to the weight of the net and projectile, they will fall to the ground. I`ll see if i can find it again.<br><br>The Apaches can be equipped with Aim-9 series missiles as well if Im not wrong.<br><br>At any rate, the current series of conflicts are proving the worth of attack helicopters but it also helps in coming up with better solutions to increase thier survivability. The Israelis are even considering increasing the armaments of normal medium-lift military helicopters so that they can function as aerial gunships.<br><br></div>

Whe the apache fly by a small town, an iraqi colonel saw it and call his counterpart at the nearby town using his handphone. So his friend arrange everything that can fire at the sky and wait. the apache got into the trap... and every single ac rtb with damage. In the end of the war only 2 apache return for operational duty.<br><br>i guess nat geo have diff pespective on this</blockquote>please provide evidence of this. link ? article? Do not say that you`ve heard this story about so and so. What are you? a rumor-mongerer? 2 out of 70 apaches return to operational duty in the end of the war ? Are you sure? Do you even know how many Apaches were deployed in the first place ? What a wuss...<br><br>The fact remains. Having it is a great force multiplier. And too bad for the monkies they train thier sights on.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I think the American's previous excursion to Iraq led them to believe that their Apaches were invulnerable to everything except Shorads.<br><br>I guess they were wrong... again.  Its no secret that the Yanks lost quite a number of apaches in the sandbox.  One of them happened to be a pretty well liked forumer on one of the Jet-sim forums.  Kinda sad, he only got his wings a few months ago before they sent him there.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>The story is true, one of the first few engagements of the war had the Yanks send in a massive Apache force to engage some Republican Guard division and the mission ended in failure after they encountered extremely heavy ground fire and had to retreat after losing a bird and have most of the rest seriously damaged.

I don't know if I could stomach this one.   The previous doctrine they used back in '91 worked!  They were using terrain for masking, and deployed the apaches into smaller hunter/killer packages that attacked from different directions.  Variation of altitude and maximizing the awesome range of hellfires.<br><br>It was a mistake they didn't have to make if they had kept their heads level and plan their missions properly.  The lessons were there before '91.  They simply forgot.</div>
