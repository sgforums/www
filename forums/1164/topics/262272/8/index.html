My friend express his first acount and opinion because it is his country. So far his information more reliable than any of us....because well he is there.<br><br>he says there were one group of nationalist who think the german were not trustworthy and also want to protect poland tank industry and its worker...then there is another group who think poland wouldnt survive without the help of nato and EU...and think that they should kow tow to what ever they demand.<br><br>one of them are gonna lose...its not about which tank is better anyway.</div>
