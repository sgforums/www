Open your eyes big and read it one more time:  <span style="color: darkred;"><strong>Hopefully these tanks will not leak in water, like those in which ex-president Habibe purchased out-dated World War II tanks from Germany.</strong></span><br><br>In my earlier posting, I mentioned 2 issues.  The lst one concerned M'sia's intention to acquire tanks from Poland.  The other was about Habibe who most of us know him to be an Indonesian, procuring German tanks from Germany.<br><br>For the millions who live in S.E. Asian countries and who have been reading newspapers often and seeing Habibe's face on tv during Suharto's time, we alll know him to be an Indonesian.  There can be no mistake about Habibe's nationality.  You youself appear to be 'very blur'<br><br>Many of us who are living outside Indonesia are also aware that Habibe was adopted by President Suharto's family, when he was a young boy.  In his adult life, Habibe spent some time in Germany and was trained there as an Engineer.<br><br>For the time he spent in Germany, Habibe thought he had a good deal when he settled on a fleet of dyfunctional German tanks from Germany.  unfortunately some of them were found to have leaked in water.<br><br>[/b]</blockquote>Just to put a halt on this WWII tank nonsense:<br><br>Indonesia did not buy any tanks from Germany.<br><br>The former East Germany however did supply Indonesia with a number of secondhand warships which were deemed surplus to requirements. These included 12 Frosch-1 class LSTs, 2 Frosch-2 class LSTs, 9 Kondor class minesweepers and 16 Parchim class corvettes.<br><br>The main addition to Indonesian armour in recent years was a small number of secondhand BTR-50 APCs and BMP-2 IFVs from Ukraine, drawn from former Soviet stock.<br><br>12 new-build BTR-80 APCs were also delivered from Russia in 2002.<br><br></div>

Against an enemy with AA capability it would be one big sitting duck as a gunship.<br><br>To supplement Apaches something small fast and nimble of the scout/attack class armed with TOW etc would be best.</div>

So, if we get A-10s, I think their capabilities will be reduced somewhat due to this restriction.</div>
