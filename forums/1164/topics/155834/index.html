            <div class='col-md body'>"Singapore chooses GE<br><br>Singapore has selected the General Electric F100-129 over Pratt &amp; WhitneyÂ’s F100-229 as the preferred engine for its new fleet of Boeing F-15Ts. GE is in contract negotiations with Singapore and P&amp;W has been informed that it will only be called in for negotiations should the country fail to complete a contract with GE, say industry sources, writes Brendan Sobie.<br><br>Last month Singapore confirmed it was in contract negotiations with Boeing for an initial eight to 12 next-generation fighters and had eliminated the only remaining contender, DassaultÂ’s Rafale. In its original proposal to Singapore last year, Boeing included pricing on both the F100-129 and F100-229. But GE and P&amp;W also submitted separate proposals to SingaporeÂ’s Defence Science and Technology Agency and the engine contract is being negotiated separately. The contract is expected to include two engines per aircraft, plus two to four spares, but it is unclear if Singapore will acquire eight or 12 F-15Ts. Singapore initially asked for bids for both eight and 12 fighters and is seeking options for another eight to 12 aircraft.<br><br>The selection of the F100-129 is a blow to P&amp;W, whose F100-220 and F100-229 now power SingaporeÂ’s fleet of Lockheed Martin F-16s. P&amp;W also has several joint venture maintenance companies in Singapore and services F100s locally with partner Singapore Technologies Aerospace."<br><br>From http://www.flightinternational.com/Articles/2005/10/04/Navigation/190/201960/Singapore+chooses+GE.html<br><br>what happened to commonality and the ease of logistics o.O</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I think someone said the GE one.<br><br>For a strike fighter, which would be carrying a heavy payload, an engine with more thrust is definitely desireable.  Carrying all those high drag payloads, LGBs, Mavericks, whatever, I would want an engine thats capable of pushing it when its needed.<br><br>I found a site that mentioned something abt PW 229 engine and the strike eagle.<br><br><blockquote>Asymmetric thrust is a potential problem only for F-15Es configured with PW F100-229 engines. In the event of an ATDPS failure above 500 KCAS or 1.1 Mach, the jet is subject to departure. Likewise, intentional asymmetric throttle inputs in this flight regime can also lead to departure.</blockquote>from <a href="http://afsafety.af.mil/magazine/htdocs/julmag97/pg15jul.htm" rel="nofollow">http://afsafety.af.mil/magazine/htdocs/julmag97/pg15jul.htm</a></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>The F-16 entered service powered by the Pratt &amp; Whitney F100 afterburning turbofan. Seeking a way to drive unit costs down the USAF implemented the Alternative Fighter Engine (AFE) program in 1984, under which the engine contract would be awarded through competition. The F110 currently powers 86% of the USAF F-16C/Ds.<br><br>The GE F110 provides 5,000 lbf (22 kN) more thrust than the P&amp;W F100 and requires more air, which lead to the increase in the area of the engine intake. The F-16C/D Block 30/32s were the first to be built with this larger intake and a common engine bay, able to accept both engines.<br><br>Initial orders were for the F110-GE-100 rated at 28,000 lbf (125 kN). Later developments include the F110-GE-129 delivering 29,000 lbf (129 kN) thrust and the F110-GE-132 delivering 32,000 lbf (142 kN)</div>
