            <div class='col-md body'>From what I gathered, so far only the elite units like guards and commandos are using the SAR. They intend to slowly phase out all M-16s over a period of time. The testing period was long over, they are going ahead with the plan.<br><br>As said before, it's a matter of getting used to the weapon's quirks, rather then criticizing it right off the bat because many of it's operations are dissimilar to the M-16, and hence supposed to be bad because they feel uncomfortable about it. Looking at it this way, if you get two people of equal skill who have had no prior training in both weapons and get one to learn the M-16 and the other the SAR, the guy with the SAR will almost certainly be more combat effective. The SAR will show it's worth once you stop treating it like the M-16. It's a rifle that's vastly easier to aim, use, maintain and shoot.<br><br>The military is a conservative organization, leave them to their own devices and they will still be using muskets today. To put it not likely, I've met this marine who thinks the M-16 with an M-203 is superior to the OICWS! He rejected the OICWS out of the bat without even bothering to truly learn about it's abilites and quirks. Yes it may look heavy and cumbersome and you probably cannot hand-to-hand with it, but in war games, it proved to be 5 times deadiler then units using the M-16 and in one match where an OICWS unit engaged an M-16/M203 unit in MILES, the OICWS unit only suffered one loss for totally knocking the opposition. The same goes for the SAR, trained up to the same level of skill, you are always going to be able to be more combat effective then with the M-16. And that's what matters, not petty remarks on how it seemed to be heavier (which is actually false), hard to balance (because they are not used to the idea of over grip CG, which makes it easy to control and even fire single handed), or the grip fatter (just plain biasness and petty egronomics) or recoil harder and so on... If ST spent so much just to turn out duds that are inferior to the M-16 in every aspect after so much study into how to make soldiers a better rifle then the M-16, they ought to be otta a job by now.<br><br>The problem seems to in the soldier's lack of education and open-mindness about the SAR, rather then any real poblem with the weapon itself.</div>

I say that gun is one hell of a gun. firing off is simply fantastic as compared to M16... no IA even firing hundreds of blanks...  however it is prone to misfire during cocking of the weapon.<br>maintainence wise... it is very easy even when compare to M16...<br>the only thing to note is that metal body. if the protective paints are wore off u will have a put in a lot of effort to remove the rust. hahahaha u will see the whole SAW covered with rust the next morning. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_sad.gif" alt="Sad" title="Sad">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_sad.gif" alt="Sad" title="Sad">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_sad.gif" alt="Sad" title="Sad"><br></div>

I used a carbine throughout my service...never really had that problem of jams...only needed to use 4 pieces out of a 5-piece cleaning rod... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">  I think the short barrel compensated for the under-feeding of gas to push back the bolt-carrier group. The only problem is that its loud, and the rifle kicks a bit...after awhile, we got used to it and adjusted for that.  Therefore, same type of ammo, but different lengths....that's my theory though...<br><br>The SAR-21 reminded me a little of my trusty carbine...short, compact, ergonomic, plus the addition of a scope too. I only wish that it came with a bayonet lug and attached bayonet. I know that modern warfare doesn't require it, but its always a dependable insurance. The bayonet could be a multi-purpose cutter like the U.S. version.<br><br>U.S. Marines? Hahaha!! They can't take our weather...plus, they are still stuck with the M-16A2 is becos' the Marines have the lowest priority among the 4 U.S. service branches in terms of military budget...that's why they are still stuck with the M-16A2, while the rest of the U.S. Army pretty much use M4s now.<br><br>The Marines were the same group that swore by the M-14 back in the old days....clunky, heavy, and often jams on auto-fire....the only good point is that it fired a 7.62 round, therefore packing a wallop, and that the accurized version was pretty good as a sniper rifle. But that's another category; as an assault rifle, it wasn't that good.<br><br>No offence to them; they are darn good soldiers; gung-ho and all. I would fight alongside them...I guess they tend to be rather conservative as compared to other branches in terms of technology.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"></div>

It's not about which branch has more experience or a longer tradition....it's about politics.The Marine's political clout in the Chiefs of Staff is smaller than the other service branches.<br><br>OICW is a good weapon. But a weapon can only carry you that far. Realistic training have to make up formost of it. The U.S. concept of fighting a war is based on technological superiority.

It gets us that far...we have to train hard and realistically for the rest of the part....</div>
