He arrived here Thursday after a four-day working visit to Japan.<br><br>Earlier, Najib and his delegation were briefed on and toured the sophisticated support battle ship at the port here.<br><br>Najib, who is also Defence Minister, said besides increasing the ATM's assets, acquiring the ship was also timely in view of the prevailing national defence requirements.<br><br>"It will be very useful in enhancing our capability in humanitarian operations. It can also be turned into a mini hospital equipped with an operation theatre."<br><br>The ship was built by Hanjin Heavy Industries &amp; Construction Co Ltd and is to be commissioned for use by the Korean navy soon.<br><br>It is equipped with the latest radar system and anti-missile weapons and could carry 700 officers and staff, besides helicopters, tanks, artillery, hovercraft and other vehicles.<br><br>Najib said the cost of buying the ship had not been determined as it would also depend on ATM's technical requirements and specifications.<br><br>"If we purchase it, it will be through international tender," he added.<br><br>On his visit to a Samsung Techwin artillery system manufacturing plant which also makes tanks, Najib said the system was highly sophisticated but the government had no plans to purchase it yet.<br><br>"In 2004, the ATM tried out the system.<br><br>"But it is not in the 9MP budget, but we will consider it if it is required," he added.<br><br>-- BERNAMA<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Alamak, you guys all fooled by the report from S Korea( the one in the original posting), firstly if you guys read the report, the description is "multipurpose warship that can also be used as a hospital ship"<br><br>Does it sound familiar?<br><br>That is becos SKorea also sell a LPD similar to our Endurance class which is also a multipurpose warship which was sold to Indonesia Navy , TNI-AL , 4 of them  and the first was a "hospital ship"<br><br>Here what the S Korean design LPD look like:<br><img src="http://i134.photobucket.com/albums/q93/ambalat/Indonesian%20Navy/KRIMakassar04.jpg"><br><br>2ndly, Dokdo class LPX  Helo carrier is certainly cannot be considered as a multipurpose warship, especailly not a hospital ship with a flat deck.<br><br>Lastly if you read the report from MY dated 11Mar, Najib said that they have no plan to purchase it yet, as there is no budget for it currently,maybe in the future, another MY fishing expedition, talk a lot but dunno when it will become a reality. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Actually, i don't really understand Malaysia defence procurement strategy/policy...<br><br>they are still operating 40 year old S-61 Nuri helicopters... surely that is now very unsafe and/or expensive to operate....<br><br>but at the same time, they are buying Super Hornets, Sukhois, a "brand-new" Submarine and now a brand new LPD...<br><br>talk about getting their priorities straight!<br><br>It is also kind of weird that they moved from the M16 to the high-tech Streyr which i believe is licence built... ..<br><br>and now moving to M4 which is based on the M16!<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Malaysia shop around and buy what they think is the best for them.<br>Then they try to fit themselves to the specs of their buy. Its only a matter of time that they outgrow the specifications of their hardware.<br><br>They should come to Singapore, who will provide them with what is suitable for them, and modify and adapt to the changing circumstances. Singapore can custom build for them.<br><br>Pride stand in the way.<br>Cost too, it will definitely not be cheap. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>RMAF can buy superbugs but they wonÂ’t get the crown jewel of APG-79 AESA, considered technically more advanced than the APG-63V3 on board F-15SG (but APG-63V3 is more powerful). IMO, Yanks should understand when RSAF purchased military hardware from them, they should prevent similar or more advanced stuff in the same class to be exported to the potential adverse for moral reasons.  But if RSAF had purchased Eurocanards then, it could have been a different story. Now with the F-15SG coming, I think RMAF either can go the Eurocanards from where the RSAF left behind or sticks to the Su30MKM buy or humbly accept a Superbug without super eye &amp; brain. Well, the reality is they are playing quite happy with the Su30MKM now, a good par with the coming F-15SG. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>
