BUT ITS the MOST CRITICAL arm of ANY ARMED FORCES!<br><br>without logistic and support... even the best front line army units will eventually crumble...<br><br>if SAF dont trust malays... they would be CRAZY to even have them in log and sup side!<br><br>if the malays are not trusted... SAF would do an IRAQ(shite) or USSR(non-russian) on them... by placing them on "malay" frontline infantry and guards!.... to use them later either as baits or cannon fodder.... to wear down the enemy.... and throw them away after they are no longer useful....<br><br>but no.... SAF aint racist... however.. i do admit that they are cautious.... and i think a singaporean malay would appreciate such caution as well... afterall.. can any malays vouch that all malays are loyal to singapore? we chinese... cant even vouch that our neighbour is loyal!</div>
