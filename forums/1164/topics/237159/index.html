It was up to a Colt salesman and a 4 of July watermelon shoot and USAF General Curtis LeMay.<br><br>As for why the XM8 was cancelled I would say that it is because of the 20 million of US tax payers money was used to develop it from an already fielded design. Which offers little or no advantage over the currently issued M16. The XM8 was an off shoot of the just as dead OICW program.<br><br>It weighs just as much as the M16, the M16 is just as modular, shoots the same round as the M16 just from a shorter barrel which brings us to another point, there have been complains about the 5.56mm lack of "stopping power" and yet the standard barrel length for the XM8 is going to be 12.5" vs the M16's 20" or the M4's 14.5". And I have a hard time believing that HK's octagonal rifling will offset the effect of the shorter barrel.<br><br>The XM8 is based off the G36 which is in turn based of ArmaLite's AR18. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br>What I don't get is the Heckler and Koch devotees who believe in their heart of hearts that if it comes from Oberndorf, it automatically represents the zenith of modern small arms development.

            <div class='col-md body'>Most of the real innovations in small arms took place beyond America though you had the M16 which was a very good gun but well politics had seen destroyed any form of innovation. Americans might piss on foreign guns, but damn hell are foreign guns for the most part superior to American ones.<br><br>Ironically, the Stoner fella was responsible for a number of guns, like the Bushmaster 25mm cannon. He has since passed on though, and I wonder who would likely equal his abilities. The guy was pretty brilliant and was responsible for lots of guns... which were also adopted by the US army eventually.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"></div>

It's one that's reliable, accurate and capable of putting down your target. Some people seem to have some kind of fetish for brand names and splitting hairs over features but I'm not to sure about that. The Germans certainly do make their stuff to a high standard, no doubt, but winning a fight goes beyond just your weapons.<br><br>I mean just about every country would like to boast their weapon is the best in this and that, but at the end of the day one wonders if the fact your weapon is expensive means if you know how to fight. Certainly it would be cool if your weapon allows you to do your job more efficently, but the rest is often splitting hairs.</div>
