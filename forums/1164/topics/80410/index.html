It must be clearly understood that the freedom Singapore enjoys is because brave Singaporeans in the armed forces protect that freedom every single day, every single minute and every single second. </strong><br><strong><br>The freedom that Singapore enjoys as a nation is contingent on those in the armed forces willing to make the ultimate sacrifice</strong> and we now have seen a brave Singaporean RSAF pilot do just that for his nation while training to defend it. <strong>I would encourage all Singaporeans to say 'thank you' the next time they see a member of the armed forces in uniform. </strong>Thank them for protecting your home, for making a sacrifice, and for protecting Singapore's freedom as a nation.<br><br>JONATHAN V.

A lack of concern to ourselves as we battle will bring us a chance of likely defeat. No harm meant. While recklessness indicates a lack of caution and control, abandonment is a <span class="large">deliberate</span> lack of self control and caution. If there is a machine gun nest in front of a soldier, knowing that he is defending his homeland and loved ones, does he stand up and charge towards it with utter 'abandonment'? Or live to fight another day?<br><br>And also..sending 700 men to catch 3 robbers (the tekong incident) is not "beyond overkill". It's the large amount of land to cover!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"> So maybe you'll expect that since 700 men is a "beyong overkill", then maybe 100-200 men is a just nice "kill" ? Thankfully for those who was in charge that didn't happen, or the robbers wouldn't have been caught.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Nope,I am not a government mouthpiece,but I feel that after the recent death of the pilot,I should raise awareness of how necessary in these times that we as soldiers are needed for the protection of our homes.<br><br>In reference to the case of 'recklesness' vs 'abandon',perhaps i should rephrase it with 'caution'.Perhaps that would work better in getting the message across?<br><br>And regarding the 2nd post,I did not mean to imply that only soldiers are the ONLY defence that Singapore has.Yes,leadership and intelligence as well as foresight are needed in protecting our economic and human/social interests abroad.You can take this message and apply it to nearly every profession,every occupation,whether blue-collar,grey-collar or white-collar.I apologise for my poverty of expression that resulted in your misunderstanding.Nearly all of us work towards the benefit of our society,whehter we know it or not.</div>
