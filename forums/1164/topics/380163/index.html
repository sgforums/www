              <p>The Malaysian newspaper, The Star had reported that the <a rel="nofollow" href="http://thestar.com.my/news/story.asp?file=/2009/10/28/nation/20091028145509&amp;sec=nation">‘Malaysian Parliament was informed of plans to phase out the 18 units of MIG-29s by end-2010, even as these planes were purchased in 1993’ (*1) </a></p>
              <p>With the phasing out of the chronic MIG-29s, it will result in a depleted <a rel="nofollow" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_aircraft_of_the_Royal_Malaysian_Air_Force">‘RMAF List of Aircraft Types’ (*2) </a>- that will have a combat fleet of only 8 units F-18 Hornets and 18 units of SU-30s.</p>
              <p>Will the FPDA be left with a gap in the air defense of the Malaysian-Singapore air space that require the RMAF to guard the northern sector ?</p>
              <p>With the high cost in maintaining the MIG-29s, one will wonder if the SU-30s require a similar sized budget to keep the planes flying.</p>
              <p>It is interesting to note the comments reported that new aircraft types from the US, France, Sweden or Britain will be considered - and much will depend on the state of the Malaysian economy.</p>
              <p>From the experience gained, it will be a surprise if further Russian planes are to be considered.</p>

              <p>From 1995 to 2007, MY was defended by 18 Migs (- 2 for accidents) and 8 F-18s (from 1997). Going forward, it will be 18 suks and 8 F-18s. No change in numbers but the suks are better than the migs.</p>
              <p>Having said that, so long as the migs are in inventory ie not sold or scrapped, they'll still be in reserve if kept in flying condition....</p>

              <p>Maths problem aside - that probably can be explained for the insistence in teaching this subject in 'Bahasa Malaysia' - there must be a reason for the factual error in the statement that "<em>the aircraft is nearing its lifespan of 10 years</em>".</p>
              <p>Still to his credit, the Minister was correct in mentioning that two out of 18 MIG-29 had crashed in 1998 and 2005.</p>
              <p>Out of the remaining 16 units, he did mention that only 10 units will continue to fly until end-2010, when only six will remain.</p>
              <p>In 2005, there was an earlier report that six MIG-29s were being cannibalised to keep the present 10 planes flying.</p>
              <p>From recent known practices, by the end of 2010, out of the 10 units, four planes will probably be cannibalised to keep the remaining 6 units in operating condition.</p>
              <p>At this rate, they will have to work out the economics between mothballing, or have one aircraft to be cannibalised to keep two flying.</p>

              <p>To be fair to the RMAF, cannibalizing of components to keep the needed aircraft flying is quite common even with reputable air forces such as that of Indian Air Force with their MIG-21s, and even the <a rel="nofollow">‘South Koreans are cannibalizing F-15K due to lack of spares’ (*1) </a>- which had arisen from lack of reliable forecasts of the requirements.</p>
              <p>Still it is surprising that prior to the RMAF acquiring the MIG-29s, and considering that they had the opportunity to work with the Indian Air Force, the fact that the Indian Air Force had so much reliability issues with their MIG-29s was not considered by the RMAF even at that stage.</p>
              <p>The Indian Air Force was already having <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.saunalahti.fi/fta/MiG-29-2b.htm">‘...extensive problems encountered in operational and maintenance due to the large number of pre-mature failures of engines, components, and systems. Of the total of 189 engines in service, 139 engines (74%) failed pre-maturely and had been withdraw from service by July 1992, thus effectively shutting down operations. 62 of these engines had not even accomplished 50% of their 300 hours first overhaul point. Thus the desired serviceability showed a steadily decreasing trend. (*2) </a></p>
              <p>To the credit of the Indian Air Force and the supporting agencies, they managed to keep the MIG-29 operational, and is a front line combat aircraft stationed along the sensitve India-Pakistan border region.</p>

              <p>Still it is surprising that prior to the RMAF acquiring the
              MIG-29s, and considering that they had the opportunity to work with
              the Indian Air Force, the fact that the Indian Air Force had so
              much reliability issues with their MIG-29s was not considered by
              the RMAF even at that stage.</p>
              <p>The Indian Air Force was already having <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.saunalahti.fi/fta/MiG-29-2b.htm">‘...extensive problems encountered in operational and
              maintenance due to the large number of pre-mature failures of
              engines, components, and systems. Of the total of 189 engines in
              service, 139 engines (74%) failed pre-maturely and had been
              withdraw from service by July 1992, thus effectively shutting down
              operations. 62 of these engines had not even accomplished 50% of
              their 300 hours first overhaul point. Thus the desired
              serviceability showed a steadily decreasing trend.
              (*2) </a></p>
              <p>To the credit of the Indian Air Force and the supporting
              agencies, they managed to keep the MIG-29 operational, and is
              a front line combat aircraft stationed along the sensitve
              India-Pakistan border region.</p>
              <p><a rel="nofollow" href="http://theasiandefence.blogspot.com/2009/10/indian-air-force-to-station-all-its-mig.html">‘To extend the service life of IAF MiG 29 by 25 to

              <p><br>If the Su-30s have the same problems as the MIG-29s, that will leave a big gap in air defense that the RMAF will have to cover with only eight F-18 Hornets across East and West Malaysia.</p>
              <p>At the earlier Aerospace Asia airshow when the Su-30 made its debut in Singapore, it was a shock to see the surface skin of the entire Su-30 had resembled the surface of a golf ball - compared to the flat and smooth surface of the US F-15 and F-16 that were present.</p>
              <p>One can only wonder if the Russians had taken a leaf out of the golf-ball technology to make the ball fly faster and further with the characteristic pock-marked surface !!!</p>
              <p>The pocked-mark dented surface must have been acheived by the sheet metal going through some panel beating job to shape the various body sections that were finally rivetted together to form the plane.</p>

              <p>I think most malaysian procurement of arms, sadly, is not in the best interests of the soldier on the ground.</p>
              <p>such as the case of alleged bribery for their scorpene subs.</p>
              <p>kinda reflected in the maintainence of thier planes too.</p>
              <p>even military forumners can find info online citing higher maintanence costs of the mig 29's. why wouldnt the procurement arm for thier military know this too?</p>
              <p>only caring about the the initial purchase?  not the long term maintainability of the aircraft?</p>
              <p>perhaps politcally tinged too, to avoid over-reliance from the Americans.</p>

              <p>The success story of the previously known <a rel="nofollow" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mikoyan">‘Mikoyan-i-Gurevich Design Bureau’ (*1) </a>-later to be known as the Russian Aircraft Corporation MiG or RSK MiG - is that it is able to sell large fleets of the plane that it build to any nation with cash or commodities to pay.</p>
              <p>Unfortunately, nothing was mentioned that almost half of the fleet sold will be needed to support and keep the other half operational and flying.</p>
              <p>In 2006, the Russian Government has merged 100% of Mikoyan shares with <a title="Ilyushin" href="/wiki/Ilyushin"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0000ff;">Ilyushin</span></span></a>, <a class="mw-redirect" title="Irkut (aircraft manufacturer)" href="/wiki/Irkut_(aircraft_manufacturer)"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0000ff;">Irkut</span></span></a>, <a title="Sukhoi" href="/wiki/Sukhoi"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0000ff;">Sukhoi</span></span></a>, <a title="Tupolev" href="/wiki/Tupolev"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0000ff;">Tupolev</span></span></a>, and <a title="Yakovlev" href="/wiki/Yakovlev"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0000ff;">Yakovlev</span></span></a> as a new company named <a rel="nofollow" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Aircraft_Corporation">‘<span style="text-decoration: underline;">United Aircraft Corporation</span>’ (*2) </a>- and with it being 100% owned by the Russian Government.</p>
              <p>The United Aircraft Corporation is an effort by the Russian Government to consolidate the various Russian aircraft construction companies and state assets engaged in the manufacture, design and sale of military, civilian, transport, and unmanned aircraft.</p>
              <p>The strengths of MiG and Sukhoi were specifically merged as one unit,</p>
              <p>With the second largest Russian State Owned Bank having 5% of its shares in EADS - (acronym for European Aeronautic Defense and Space Company N.V.) - being transferred to United Aircraft Corporation; and with EADS owning 10% of Irkut shares that it plans to convert to UAC shares - there may see some deeper involvement of European aircraft manufacturers in the Russian aircraft industry.</p>
              <p>This may result in some improvements in the aircraft design and maintenance issues of Russian built planes.</p>
