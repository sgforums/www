What if you encountered a tank.<br><br>Sure but your point is taken as well, firing a LAW into a RPG mounted on the window would be good. My point was, not to use the LAW just to make a hole into a wall.  </div></blockquote>if you read the forum "mbt in urban area" abt battle for the chechian capital grozny. You will find that it took them 60,000 troop against 12,000 chechian fighters or ratio of 5:1 just to secure and defend every building in the city. Not to mention the equipment + stacks and stacks of explosives, grenades and demo charges and other ordanance used in the process. In the end all the russians got was a city of rubble. Here is an excerpt of what happened.<br><br>http://www.fas.org/man/dod-101/ops/war/docs/grozny.htm<br><br>... City fighting in Grozny required much larger stocks of hand grenades, smoke grenades, demolition charges and disposable, one-shot anti-tank grenade launchers (similar to the U.S. LAW) than expected.  Each infantry soldier needed a rope with a grappling hook for entering buildings.  Light-weight ladders were also very valuable for assaulting infantry.  Trained snipers were essential, but were in short supply.<br><br>Conclusion.<br><br>The reality of urban combat in Grozny was different than the urban combat the Soviets planned for.  The terrain, circumstances and enemy were different.  Grozny could not be bypassed.  The Russians were faced with the dilemma of having to destroy Grozny in order to save it.  The Russian Army also faced the same problem it faced 136 years earlier when it also fought to subjugate Chechnya.  The Chechens turned every city, village and hamlet into a fortress and inflicted serious casualties on the Russian columns.  On both occasions, the Russian army performed poorly initially, but adapted and eventually triumphed in urban combat. These recent Russian lessons are now being incorporated in Russian urban tactics.<br><br>With our current forces dun think that's any possibility to capture anybody's capital and defend ours at the same time. Not to mention protecting the msr artery leh? The most we can do is hold a few towns.<br><br>But it's good news for us, we have more buildings than in grozny. Any would be attacker will have to first contend with a difficult amphibous landing.<br><br>Then just to take the whole island for fibua They will need a ratio of 5:1 just to take us on.<br><br>The only reason why anybody wanting to attack us will be to totally demolish everything, which means not only the arm forces will be fighting, a few hundred thousand able bodied will be armed to the teeth, they will have so much problems up to their eyeballs because we will turn the whole place upside down and bury them here in the end they will get nothing.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>In December 1994, the Russian Army entered the break-away Republic of Chechnya and attempted to seize the Chechen capital of Grozny from the march. After this attempt failed, the Russian Army spent two months in deliberate house-to-house fighting before finally capturing the city. During the fighting, the Russian conscript force was badly mauled by the more-mature, dedicated Chechen force. During the first month of the conflict, Russian forces wrote off 225 armored vehicles as non-repairable battle losses. This represents 10.23% of the armored vehicles initially committed to the campaign. The bulk of these losses were due to shoulder-fired antitank weapons and antitank grenades.<br><br>The Chechen forces were armed with Soviet and Russian-produced weapons and most Chechen fighters had served in the Soviet Armed Forces. The Chechen lower-level combat group consisted of 15 to 20 personnel subdivided into three or four-man fighting cells. These cells had an antitank gunner (normally armed with the RPG-7 or RPG-18 shoulder-fired antitank rocket launcher), a machine gunner and a sniper. Additional personnel served as ammunition bearers and assistant gunners. Chechen combat groups deployed these cells as anti-armor hunter-killer teams. The sniper and machine gunner would pin down the supporting infantry while the antitank gunner would engage the armored target. Teams deployed at ground level, in second and third stories, and in basements of buildings. Normally five or six hunter-killer teams simultaneously attacked a single armored vehicle. Kill shots were generally made against the top, rear and sides of vehicles. Chechens also dropped bottles filled with gasoline or jellied fuel on top of vehicles. The Chechen hunter-killer teams tried to trap vehicle columns in city streets where destruction of the first and last vehicles will trap the column and allow its total destruction.<br><br>The elevation and depression angles of the Russian tank barrels were incapable of dealing with hunter-killer teams fighting from basements and second or third-story positions and the simultaneous attack from five or six teams negated the effectiveness of the tanks' machine guns. The Russians attached ZSU 23-4 and 2S6 track-mounted antiaircraft guns to armored columns to respond to these difficult-to-engage hunter-killer teams.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>The RPG-7V is a recoilless, shoulder-fired, muzzle-loaded, reloadable, antitank grenade launcher. It fires an 85-mm (PG-7) or 70-mm (PG-7M) rocket-assisted HEAT grenade from a 40-mm smoothbore launcher tube. The launcher has two hand grips; a large optical sight; a thick, wooden heat guard around the middle; and a large, flared blast shield at the rear of the tube. The RPG-7V is light enough to be carried and fired by one person. However, an assistant grenadier normally deploys to the left of the gunner to protect him with small arms fire. The grenadier normally carries two rounds of ammunition, and the assistant grenadier carries three rounds.<br><br>In recent years, Bazalt has developed the newest models of multifunctional antitank grenade weapons that meet the requirements of modern combat. First of all, it is an array of new ammunition items for the renowned RPG-7 grenade launcher. These include rounds with a high degree of commonality with base models and invariable rules and technique of their firing from the RPG-7 grenade launcher:<br><br>- PG-7VR with a tandem warhead capable of defeating modern tanks provided with apron explosive reactive armor;<br><br>- TBG-7V with a thermobaric warhead which in terms of lethality is comparable to the 120mm artillery projectile or mortar shell;<br><br>- OG-7V with a fragmentation warhead whose accuracy is very close to that of small arms.<br><br>The PG-7VP was the first grenade launcher round in the world which realized the tandem principle of shaped charge warhead functioning.<br><br>The thermobaric TBG-7V round operates on the enhanced blast principle. It is a powerful and effective weapon of a motorized rifle element. The warhead explosion creates a high temperature field possessing an efficient incendiary effect and simultaneously generates a powerful blast wave. In addition, the explosion forms a fragmentation pattern with an initial velocity of splinters 1.5 to 1.7 times higher than in the event of traditionally filled projectiles. The joint effect of these factors engages unsheltered manpower within a radius of 10 m from the point of explosion. The entrenched manpower is engaged even in the absence of a direct hit owing to the strongly marked "pouring" effect of thermobaric filler explosion products. When firing at lightly armored materiel, the warhead, due to its peculiar structure, pierces a hole 150 to 180 mm in diameter or makes a breach measuring about 200 x 500 mm. In either case, the explosion products get behind the armor and defeat the crew and mounted troops.<br><br>The OG-7V fragmentation round is particularly effective against weapon emplacements during combat operations in populated and industrial areas and on broken terrain. As a rule, these targets are specially prepared embrasures and firing ports made in brick and reinforced concrete structures for the delivery of small arms fire. The accuracy and effectiveness of the warhead ensures the first-round hit of such a weapon emplacement at a range of up to 300 m.<br><br>Thus, the RPG-7V1 grenade launcher with new PG-7VP, TBG-7V and OG-7V rounds allows a soldier to accomplish an unprecedented range of missions on the battlefield.<br><br>Antitank rocket grenades, as well as RPG-26 and RPG-27 dispensable grenade launchers, developed by Bazalt, are individual soldier's weapons intended to fight armor and destroy manpower in bunkers, brick and reinforced concrete structures and fortifications.<br><br>The technique of firing the RPG-26 and RPG-27 grenade launchers boils down to three simple operations. Having small dimensions (73 mm in caliber and 750 mm long) and a light weight (2.9 kg), the RPG-26 can be carried by a paratrooper. The RPG-26 warhead defeats armor up to 500 mm thick as well as reinforced concrete, brickwork and timber 1,000, 1,500 and 2,400 mm thick, respectively. Judging by the use of this grenade launcher in various local conflicts, it is considered the best soldier's weapon.<br><br>The RPG-27 is the follow-on to the RPG-26 grenade launcher and is outfitted with a 105mm tandem warhead, unified with the PG-7VR round and capable of defeating modern tanks at any course angle.<br><br>On the basis of the RPG-26 and RPG-27 launchers, the RShG-1 and RShG-2 assault weapons were developed to enhance a soldier's firepower in modern warfare. Rocket assault grenades with disposable grenade launchers, retaining all the merits of base models and provided with new multiple destructive effect warheads, can effectively defeat virtually all types of targets on the battlefield.<br><br>The antitank grenade weapons, developed by the Bazalt State Research and Production Enterprise, can accomplish traditional missions of defeating current and future tanks with enhanced protection.<br><br>The achievement of these objectives has become possible owing to the use of a principally new approach to the design and manufacture of weapons. First of all, this is a principle of modular weapon development. It is based on the creation and manufacture of a broad range of universal modules. Bazalt began to introduce this principle in the mid-1980s. The creation of universal modules is naturally more complicated than the development of traditional components and requires unique engineering approaches and advanced technologies that can ensure the weapon's long service life and conformity with assigned specifications.<br><br>The first universal module for antitank grenade weapons developed by Bazalt was a 105mm shaped-charge warhead tipped to PG-7VR, PG-29V and RPG-27 rounds. Principally new engineering approaches to the design satisfy the assigned high requirements in terms of effectiveness and use against armored materiel to be manufactured till the year 2005.<br><br>Their potential allows modernization of the warhead to increase its armor penetrating ability to 10 - 12 calibers and prolong the life of ammunition to the year 2010, at the least.<br><br></div>

Judging by the use of this grenade launcher in various local conflicts, it is considered the best soldier's weapon.<br><br>The RPG-27 is the follow-on to the RPG-26 grenade launcher and is outfitted with a 105mm tandem warhead, unified with the PG-7VR round and capable of defeating modern tanks at any course angle.<br><br>On the basis of the RPG-26 and RPG-27 launchers, the RShG-1 and RShG-2 assault weapons were developed to enhance a soldier's firepower in modern warfare. Rocket assault grenades with disposable grenade launchers, retaining all the merits of base models and provided with new multiple destructive effect warheads, can effectively defeat virtually all types of targets on the battlefield.<br><br>The antitank grenade weapons, developed by the Bazalt State Research and Production Enterprise, can accomplish traditional missions of defeating current and future tanks with enhanced protection.<br><br>The achievement of these objectives has become possible owing to the use of a principally new approach to the design and manufacture of weapons. First of all, this is a principle of modular weapon development. It is based on the creation and manufacture of a broad range of universal modules. Bazalt began to introduce this principle in the mid-1980s. The creation of universal modules is naturally more complicated than the development of traditional components and requires unique engineering approaches and advanced technologies that can ensure the weapon's long service life and conformity with assigned specifications.<br><br>The first universal module for antitank grenade weapons developed by Bazalt was a 105mm shaped-charge warhead tipped to PG-7VR, PG-29V and RPG-27 rounds. Principally new engineering approaches to the design satisfy the assigned high requirements in terms of effectiveness and use against armored materiel to be manufactured till the year 2005.<br><br>Their potential allows modernization of the warhead to increase its armor penetrating ability to 10 - 12 calibers and prolong the life of ammunition to the year 2010, at the least.<br><br></div></blockquote>After reading yr post, my recommendation to Mindef : BUY RPG-7!!!<br>Hmm.. wonder if the militia in Iraq are using any of the new ammo, maybe that's why the Abrams there are getting kicked in their behinds.. hehe..<br><br>If the ammo works as advertised of course... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br></div>
