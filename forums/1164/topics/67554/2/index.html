If the 84 gun until now still dun want to change to MKII or something else you guys can forget it.<br><br>The LAW we trained traditionally not meant for killing MBT, more for bunkers or soft skin vehicles upto light amoured vehicles or for softening up small clusters   of enemy forces.<br><br>And if they do replace it, you can bet it will definately be heavier since it is going to pack more punch but they will require a reason why they need to replace it since we are operational with LAW for many years &amp; logistically I think it is manufactured under license.<br><br>If they do change it I would advocate going for a thermobaric option since some of our closer neighbours already have it in their inventory and have no qualms to using a chemical based weapon.</div>

And LAW,SAW and M203 are protrayed. They trying to say that now Section got a lot of firepower. These weapons may not seem like a big deal now, but during the late 80s, these are a lot of firepower! NVGs are almost unheard of. No Spike, AGL or LSV.<br></div>

Cause last time I checked the targets were tanks? Not BUNKERS or walls(why do you want a hole in a wall for? FIBUA, we use C4 door charge).<br><br>Btw, what a LAW(thus, the name Light Antitank Weapon) does is not blow up the tank like the ATGM(Heavey Antitank Weapon). Its meant to drill into the tank, and once inside, its creates a thermo heat reaction which causes the tank to heat up and melt the crew inside.<br><br>For the latest US tank used in Iraq, their armour has a reflective shield which most conventional ATWs would bounce off. Our LAW would be ineffective against it. The weakest spot is still between the turret. But thats the hardest spot to aim and also the most dangerous. The best use of the LAW in this case would be to aim for the tank's tracks. Once the tracks are destroyed, it will be a sitting duck. However, looking at the formidable US tank division, I will be over run by say a 100-odd tanks. Haha...<br><br><span style="color: blue;">-&gt;The Main Battle Tank and Light Armour Weapon, MBT LAW, developed by Saab Bofors Dynamics, was selected in May 2002 for the UK Army Next generation Light Anti-tank Weapon (NLAW). The portable, short range, fire-and-forget system will enter service in 2006 to replace the British Army's existing Insys LAW-80 system that is reaching the end of its operational life.</span><br><br>We might follow the British... and get the MBT.

You won't be able to get into the building and use the door all the time. Last time i checked, plastic explosives don't walk up to a target by itself.<br></div>

Hence, using a LAW was not taught as we wanted to capture the building and secure hostages if any or reuse it as an objective to defend.<br><br>If we wanted the building to be blown to bits, I would just call for an FO or air strike!!!<br><br>LAW is a precious item 1 shot only, only 2 LAW to a section.

            <div class='col-md body'>The Armbrust I believe have amour penetration of up to 300mm which is quite limited against most MBT even by the 80s when it was first introduced into SAF.<br><br>Most modern MBT(designed since late 70s and 80s) have  armour protection of more than 300mm in the turret and glacis.<br>But with introduction bolted ERA and other applique armour, it even less likely to penetrate even a older tank. It will be lucky to hit a mobility kill targeting the side and the rear of the tank.<br><br>Therefore, the Armbrust was not designed to handle MBT but rather against APC, bunker and other light vehicles which they are more effective. It is also cheap (USD1.5k) and simple to use, but the probability of hits is quite low too especially against a moving target.<br><br><img src="http://www.ravenshield-fr.com/images/RS_animation4.gif"></div>
