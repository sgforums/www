            <div class='col-md body'>After looking all these pics from these website, i find SAF military training is nothing compare to the ROK(South Korean army). Somemore, our training is getting even more relax each year. Wonder will it affect the quality of our soldiers?Even though ROK is a conscripted army which is same as the SAF, but they still maintain a very highly trained and tough army. At least, the korean soldiers look more garang and professional than our soldiers.<br>South Koreans field an INCREDIBLE infantry. This reputation evolved particulary when the US used KATUSA; Korean soliders detached to Regular Army units in S. Korea. Although the Koreans solider earned a fraction of their US counterparts, they were indefatigable--they could run all day, highly disciplined, and sharp as tacks. This reputation applied to their Ranger School. US personnel did attend this course, but the graduation rate was always extremely low, and eventually the Korean Ranger course was closed to US personnel on the grounds of the low grad rate.<br><br>http://www.militaryphotos.net/forums/viewtopic.php?t=2563&amp;highlight=rok</div>

NSF always think "Serve for what, waste my 2 years" or "The army don't need me la, I 2 push up also cannot do". They don't see the importance of serving NS. They don't see the threat Singapore is facing, they take security for granted and last but not least. do they even love our homeland?  (I've yet to serve my NS)<br><br>While people from SK, from my understanding, they are kind of loyal to their country. Soldiers regconize that the threat is VERY real for them. Bitterness of the korean war are still very fresh in some of them.<br>They take pride in their job and they put in commitment and effort, this is possible because SK soldiers love their country and they regconize the threat they are facing.<br><br>In my opinion it all boils down to patriotism.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>True lar, I won't disagree that the S.Korean soldiers are a whole lot tougher than  the SAF.  And thats when u look at things at a broad spectrum.  But remember, they are still only honoring a ceasefire with N.Korea.  The war is essentially NOT over.<br><br>I've spoken to some korean friends who came over to Singapore before.  While its true that they are very garang... but there are lots of complaints about their overly tough training.  For trainees to die is COMMON over there.  Its a loss which their country can withstand I suppose.  In Singapore's case, every man we lose is a significant impact to our 4million people strong nation.<br><br>If we can modify our training such that its safe, nevermind a lil slack, we can still overcome that "garang" edge with technology.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>It's one thing to be garang, it's anothing thing to get the job done. Singaporean soldiers are not fierce. They do not burn with aggression. They also may not be the fittest soldiers in the world. However, if you give Singaporean soldiers a task to do, they will complete it, no matter how long it takes or how hard it is. They will learn what they need to learn, plan what needs to be done, adapt to the situation and finish the job. That is what matters in war -- mission success.</div>

All last min work.Anyhow do one.U tink other countries' soldiers cannot do it meh.I tink they can do it  even better than our soldiers.Cos of their wills and strong mentality due to their hard lives and training.</div>
