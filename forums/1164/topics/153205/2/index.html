            <div class='col-md body'>its difficult to compare two armies in two very different areas. My Korean friends here cannot tahan the heat and humidity and our guys would be frozen to korea when they go to korea in the winter.<br><br>Koreans are trained to fight in high open(with no trees covering) mountain or on plains and they are equipped with heavy artillery and heavy tanks. We fight in build up areas and tropical jungle.<br><br>we know we are stronger than our likely enemies in quality and quantity in terms of hardware and we even have numerical superiority in strength in one case. The Korean have to face north korean, outnumber them in strength (of course everyone black belt),  and also superior in numbers of hardware.<br><br>South Koreans youngsters are also growing up in comfortable environment like us. A hell of a lot more comfortable compared to the north koreans.<br><br>My experience with my guys during NS is like this. In camp everybody kao bei kao bu, dont do this and avoid that. But during live firing exercise, when real bullets fly, they are the most responsive and cooperative guys I know, especially compared to colleagues in private companies.<br><br>So when, there is a real war, when bullets fly, guys who stay are guys who cannot migrate or had no chance to take the last flight. I believe we are good enough! It is also fortunate that we will not be fighting against the north koreans. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Too be frank, I am quite sadden by the fact that our army is getting more and more soft as each day gets by. It is wide known fact that people with a proper discipline military training, tends to have a better disciplined and matured thinking compare to the those w/o any miltary training.<br><br>Malaysia has witnessed that usefulness in enforcing discipline into the male Sg citizens for the past decades. That is the reason why our neighbour decide to copy our model and implement it across the Johor Straits. Despite the fact that our Boleh friends are having some "minor" teething issue, due to some "unforeseeable" issues, they are very determined to let the Boleh National Service to stay. The Boleh gov officals are determined to use national service as a tool to enforce discipline in their youth and build up their characters.<br><br>Korea and Taiwan are two countries in Far East that have been implementing national service for the past 40 years at least. It is a known fact that all males in these 2 countries must be enrolled into the military services. The ROK and ROC training is much much more more SIONG than what we have in Burnei or Thailand campsites. The realities that the ROK and ROC are faciing hostilies, had sharpened the alertness of the soldiers, the disciplines are enforeced w/o question. When the soldiers left the military services, weather they will go into big company like Samsung and LG, or venture his own business or IT setup, their discipline and "never say die" mindset have helped them to achieve the best of the best in the age of globalization. Today, the Korean and Taiwanese are much more successful than we are. They have many more successful Fortune 500 companies and SMEs than Singapore.<br><br>It is a sad fact that Singaporean seems to be getting more and more soft. The education system in schools are more focusing in getting the grades than real education. The schools are more interested in displaying the "merits" in the banners hanging outside the schools. Nowadays, school kids discipline is real headache for many school. If our NS is also so soft, w/o a proper focus on discipline, then we will be the one who suffer later. Already, we have heard reports that Singaporeans are too "well taken care of", unable to take hardship, thinking of making big w/o much effort (easy way out). This is the gross product of our "Thinking Soldier" concept; always thinking and thinking, no action! Then, how to get results??<br></div>
