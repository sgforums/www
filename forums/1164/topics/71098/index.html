            <div class='col-md body'>Cost of defence crippling: DSTA (reported in Today Feb 26 2004)<br><br>THE cost of buying military equipment and maintaining military capabilities is rising and is becoming increasingly unaffordable for Singapore, warned senior officers from the Defence Science and Technology Agency (DSTA) yesterday.<br>.<br>"Unless this problem is tackled, we will not be able to afford many new systems," said Mr Soh Kong Pheng, the DSTA's deputy chief executive of operations, at the Asian Aerospace 2004 show.<br>.<br>One reason for the high expenditure is the cost of operating and supporting the equipment, which can be more than twice the purchase price, said DSTA deputy director Lee Wee Khong. Which means, for example, the planned purchase of new fighter aircraft, reputed to be worth $1 billion, could incur another $2 billion.<br>.<br>This is why the DSTA, Singapore's defence procurement agency, has told competing suppliers to minimise the up-front expenditure and suggest support concepts for spares and maintenance.<br>.<br>It has also tried to be cost effective by keeping price and technical proposals separate, so that the price is only known after the technical benefits have been assessed. "Then, the system with the best benefit-cost ratio will be selected," Mr Lee told industry suppliers.<br>.<br>Even low-value purchases take their toll on military expenditure. Items such as stationery, photocopies and electrical appliances as well as camp maintenance cost the Singapore Armed Forces up to $60 million a year.

            <div class='col-md body'>Well, thats very true.Lots of prices I see in quotes by MACs for repairs are simply mind -boggling..you do not need to have worked in related fields in the private sector to know that these are inflated figures.As for what you mentioned about OETI, the LCD monitors are not value-added for the lectures are useless when we are posted to our units , because thats where we learn the real stuff..I mean , for a place where a small morsel is given for tasting, a normal CRT monitor would do well.I really hope there won't be a rise in vested interests dictating what we do with our hard-earned tax money.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>budget is tight because we peg our defence spending at 6% of our GDP. Once the economy goes down hill, 6% can buy u very little compared to the boom period. Coupled with a weak Sing dollar, even worse.<br><br>The plasma tv fiasco! Yes, I am very familiar with it. A friend who managed a government building contract once told me how the project manager decided to throw in the plasma because 'got money, spend lor'. Short sighted mentality but a sympton of civil service problems. If a given budget, especially for maintenance is not used up, MOF will reduce the budget in the next financial year. So u see managers scrimp n save in the beginning of the FY, and then spend like mad towards the end. Sometimes I wonder why they just couldnt use better budget / resource mgmt techniques and review the expediture every quarter to ensure money is spend correctly and equally.</div>
