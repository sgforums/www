Hence we need something to leapfrong the competition and put us all the way out infront, for an effective detterence, rather then keep aquiring existing systems in ever increasing numbers.<br><br>The F-16 is still effective, but it's in itself approaching the limit of it's airframe lifecycle. To use it as a replacement for our Skyhawks would be akin to replacing a 60 year old retiree with a 45 year old worker. While it may be cost effective in the short run, it will not add up in the end, when we find ourselves needing to replace our F-16s say, 15 years down the road, with what? NGFs. And of course, we would have missed out on 15 years of getting a headstart in operating ATFs in the region, and along with it, lots of technical expertise that would allow us to fight the air war far better.<br><br>Can an F-16 still be on the cutting edge in the skies of the future? No doubt it will still be high up the food chain but certainly no longer the top dog.<br><br>In hunting for an NGF, I think the RSAF is pretty justified.</div>

Lets say you go Sim Lim...buy a printer...cheap cheap...very nice, high resolution printing etc. But you did not factor in the costly ink catridges. So over time, your cost of running the printer is very high. (It is a known fact printer makers sell it cheap, sometime below cost...and earn on ink catridges sale)<br><br>As to why not another batch of F16,  I think is wise not to put too many eggs in one basket. If something happens, like they accident, or discover a fault.....the whole fleet will be grounded. If pure F16, we will be defenceless....unless they come up with a way to arm the E2C hawkeye / KC-135.... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I have always suspected this NGF buy has to do with the SU-30s coming online in SEA.........<br><br>With USD10 billion a year in military aid, Israel can afford to do alot of things to keep the lead. Eg Lavi fiasco.<br><br>Singapore don't have that aid and I hope as an independent country we will never have that aid. We don't have any natural resources to make up for it too.<br><br>The F-16 can go a long long way.......you just need to exercise the mind a little harder to 'squeeze every milli-gram of fight in them'.<br><br>Just like the TA-4S, SAF can work with Lockheed Martin to find an answer for a Singapore re-worked F16-A.......or some other 'F-16 upgrade designs' in LM's closet that's looking for a partner to get going.<br><br>That'll keep our engineers/scientists busy until the JSF comes along.<br><br>In Vietnam war, swarms of GCI Mig-15s flying in circles made the F4 pilots pissed in their cockpits.<br><br>SAF will have 500 F-16s networked to handle 30 Su 30s. With the right sensors deployed in right platform....we'll see them ( in 3D!!!)before they see us.<br><br>Got to move away from this platform centric thinking........<br><br>Sometimes Sim Lim Square does offer a steal......one has to work harder to look for it!<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I don't really agree on the 500 F16 scenario. Having 500 F16 instead of 50 NGF would mean 10 times more pilots and more importantly 10 times more ground support personnel. that is crucial in a Singapore context as manpower is scace. Also any potential conflict would likely to be short which is why attrition is not too important, so numbers are not so important. Having a sharp and decisive weapon is more crucial.<br><br>Also the "running" cost of running a larger number of less capable a/c could be also high. Again manpower is the issue.<br><br>That is why we are getting new frigates and new LSTs instead of some ex-USN hand-me-downs. Although the new ships cost MUCH more, they will need less people to run because of more hi-tech and automation.<br><br>I think getting a NGF is a good idea. I am concern about the escalting cost of the defence, but I think that phasing out the A4s would probably save some money and headcouts  which can go into operating the NGF.<br><br>At the end of the day we would end up spending more on hardware. If we really need to be creative, we should look at cutting down on wastage and maybe also the salary and number of BGs instead of scrapping plans of gettting more hardware.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Another example of manpower being the issue. I think part of the reason why we are getting the new SPH is because they only need "4" men to run. That is even lesser than a mortar carrying M113 and certainly lesser then the towed 155mm FH2000/88.<br><br>And maybe that is why we are taking so long to find a SM1 replacement. I don't think SAF is seriously looking a platform that needs 4 men instead of 3.<br><br></div>

Spare parts are harder to find,<br><br>Like one of the member said if they found a fault in the F16 or its Engines( thousand of items to go wrong) the whole fleet will be ground <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_evil.gif" alt="Evil or Very Mad" title="Evil or Very Mad"> ..can u iimage our A-4 Super SkyHawk/F5 going aginst the Mig29/Su-30.. 100 SKyHawk vs 30 Mig29/SU-30 and we will still get wipe out by their BVR missile and close in dogfight <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_eek.gif" alt="Shocked" title="Shocked"> . No doubt the Soviets during the Cold War justify their numbers by the saying <span style="font-style: italic;">" quantity is a quality on its own"</span> but with the advance of technology and missile, we need more bang for our buck. No Point having 400 F-16s with an radar crosssection of an car and the enemy sees you long way beforehand/cross into their airspace when you can have 30 - 40 more stealthy 4th generation fighters creeping up to them and say "Boo!"<br><br>A10 are built for CAS just look at the Tatitium bathtub the Pilots are sitting in  and all their subsystem are duplicate or triplicate. Its  speed are slow so that the pilots can keep the battlefiled within sight when they are do turns (that is also their killing points too slow!) and the A10 converted to OA10 the US are just fitting with the 30mm, flare podsand 70mm rokects only while the A4  they arent clear for much store and their 20mm guns may not be much of an CAS use and with thier high run speeed may not even be efficent<br><br>NGF is on the table whether or not cost is there as we need to maintain our technological superiority over our potential enemy.<br><br>Cost of "<span style="font-style: italic;">E-2C should be replacing with LADARs on B747s with space satellites with a prism/mirror. SAR is outdated liao."</span> not feasible as the operating an B747 is hugh and not to mentioned that u need at least 2 - 3 B747 to maintain rd the clock vigil and also for maintance period, Space satellite? where are we going to get that? We got at most 1 or 2 mini satellite by NUS/NTU and the best chance we have is the Israel Opef 4 (Opps isnt that a secret projects <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_eek.gif" alt="Shocked" title="Shocked"> )<br><br></div></blockquote>OK one more try <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"><br><br>I remember seeing T33s, Strikies (I think maybe Hunters too?) being coated with some paint before they were parked under the hot humid sun at end of runway in Paya Lebar.<br><br>With underground caverns and their controlled environment something can be arranged.<br><br>You can run one fleet of F16 running two engine types. That will spread the risks alot. BTW the airframe should have proven itself because F16s have clocked a very lot of hours. Albeit mostly in temperate climate........but the 7 xF16s in RSAF should give some clues here.<br><br>Of course you don't expect A4SUs to go up against MIG29s/SU30s BUT with networking(which MAY already be in place) you don't need a radar on board to launch AMRAAMs. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_twisted.gif" alt="Twisted Evil" title="Twisted Evil"><br><br>Need to qualify AMRAAMs on A4SUs. Probably pylon rewiring to MIL STD 1750? We have the cap for that. On that aspect, I think you need to brush up on what stores the A4 is qualified on. Visit the RSAF open house. Some stores we may not even know about!<br><br>The A4's speed/acceleration is a protection against VSHORAD - a common complaint on the A-10 in the CAS role.<br><br>I would argue that Brahmos-S together with our own Super Duper networking and additional AEW sensors/platform IS ALREADY A HUMONGOUS (AND ORGASMIC) TECHNOLOGICAL ADVANTAGE OVER POTENTIAL ENEMIES.<br><br>Of course if RSAF pilots YEARN DEARLY to talk dirty and expect a HOT reaction from their ride....... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br><br>That I agree we don't have now. But I do recall the ACMI pods have a audio advisory feature for several scenario - one of them is anti-mid-air collision -&gt;"Pull hard right", "Pull harder!", "Pull harder!!!", "Argh!!!", "Tissue please" <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br><br>LADAR is still some long ways away...... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"><br><br>Plans for satellites is still ongoing rest assure it's more than one or two but they may not be just remote sensing only.<br><br></div>

To use it as a replacement for our Skyhawks would be akin to replacing a 60 year old retiree with a 45 year old worker. While it may be cost effective in the short run, it will not add up in the end, when we find ourselves needing to replace our F-16s say, 15 years down the road, with what? NGFs. And of course, we would have missed out on 15 years of getting a headstart in operating ATFs in the region, and along with it, lots of technical expertise that would allow us to fight the air war far better.<br><br>Can an F-16 still be on the cutting edge in the skies of the future? No doubt it will still be high up the food chain but certainly no longer the top dog.<br><br>In hunting for an NGF, I think the RSAF is pretty justified.</div></blockquote>This hunt is for a replacement for the A4 skyhawk attack plane and not about finding a replacement for the F16 which is used more for the defence of singapore's airspace.anyway the F16 is far from reaching the limit of its airframe lifecycle.we just bought some more from the states a couple of years back,brand new airframes and not u.s surplus stocks.we need an attack aircraft for deep strike interdiction into enemy territory,the A4 cannot do tat with its limited range and payload.the F16 can do this but not as well as the F15 tat we are going to buy.</div>
