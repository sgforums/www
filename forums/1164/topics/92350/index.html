            <div class='col-md body'>Well,actually I see the change from the Styer SSG to the Accuracy International PM Sniping rifle is due to the fact that the Malaysians have recently bought over the Austrian Styer firm.And as such,we may feel the need to break away from relying on them.As such,we have the need to change a standard isue sniping weapon.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I hate to bust all the excited bubble but as long as its not officially reported in the news or in the latest PIONEER mag, the replacement for the SAF sniper rifle system is still not confirmed.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_eek.gif" alt="Shocked" title="Shocked"><br><br>As for the use of the L96A1, its been in the sniper armoury for quite sometime.  There are also a few other sniper rifle models that SAF have for evaluation, last heard was that they were considering on semi-atuo sniper system for the 3G snipers.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>If its because M'sia now has the rights to developing Styer's weapon resulting in S'pore not getting further Styer weapon then why get L96A1 when the the M'sian armed forces sniper also uses it?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_confused.gif" alt="Confused" title="Confused"><br><br>SAF/ MINDEF is all about cost &amp; effectiveness, they want cheap but damn-super good stuff which usually doesn't go that way offen.  BTW, SAR-21 has its own sniper rifle version, extended heavy barrel &amp; chamber for 7.62, semi-auto.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br><br>Anyway, its not that te L96 sniper rifles are not going to be part of the armoury but it would most likely to be a new model.  However, it would be best to wait &amp; see.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Seems the new rifle has twice the telescopic power of the SSG69.<br><br>Talk about SAR-21 sniper variant......extremely unsuitable for field snipers due to various factors:<br><br>1) Auto chambering of rounds can damage projectiles and lead to inconsistent flight.<br><br>2) Semi-auto bolt movement adds statistical inaccuracy during fire.<br><br>3) Gas diverted for chambering adds to inaccuracy during fire.<br><br>3) Automatic ejection of rounds may give away position.<br><br>4) No need for multiple continous fire due to nature of deployment and mission. Less maintenance. Sniper rifles are less prone to carbon fouling.<br><br>One may argue that the best semi-auto rifle in the world, PSG1, is non less accurate than the general bolt action rifles. One may want to think twice when your target is 800m away and you need an upper body shot to confirm a kill.<br><br>Weird facts: The SSG69 sniper rifle stock scope has radioactive gas inside.
