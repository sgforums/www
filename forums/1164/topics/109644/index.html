            <div class='col-md body'>From the Strait Times Webby:-<br><br>KUALA LUMPUR - MALAY-LANGUAGE newspaper in Malaysia has published an article explaining why the Republic of Singapore Air Force (RSAF) will not be affected if its jets are not allowed to train in Johor's airspace.<br><br>Berita Harian Malaysia ran the article last Saturday after a recent meeting between Malaysian Prime Minister Abdullah Ahmad Badawi and Singapore's Senior Minister Goh Chok Tong.<br><br>The leaders had discussed RSAF jets training in Malaysian airspace, an issue that had sparked concerns over Malaysia's sovereignty and security.<br><br>These concerns, expressed by Johor's Menteri Besar Abdul Ghani Othman and Johor Umno Youth, are valid, said the article written by Associate Professor Azmi Hassan of Univer- siti Teknologi Malaysia.<br><br>He noted that the issue of Malaysian sovereignty had arisen several times in the past because RSAF jets took advantage of a bilateral pact and 'flew over undesignated zones'.<br><br>'Even though Singapore gave reasons to justify its actions, Malaysians considered these as intrusions as they violated our national sovereignty,' he wrote.<br><br>'In fact, after Malaysia cancelled the agreement there were several incidents of our airspace being intruded upon by RSAF jets.'<br><br>He also cited Malaysia's security as 'another factor why our airspace should not be opened to RSAF jets'.<br><br>Referring to the RSAF as a highly efficient organisation 'with the most sophisticated modern arms and equipment', he said Singapore could allocate up to 9 per cent of its gross domestic product for defence.<br><br>With this 'extremely high allocation', the RSAF can afford to buy the best equipment and pay for airspace and other training facilities for RSAF pilots, he added.<br><br>Singapore has forged several types of training cooperation with countries such as the United States, Australia and Thailand.<br><br>It is also involved in joint military exercises with the United States and Australia 'which are more than adequate for RSAF pilots', said Prof Azmi.<br><br>He said: 'Actually there is no need for Malaysia to open up its airspace to the RSAF as the RSAF has everything.<br><br>'Such a stand should not be construed as bullying or not wanting to compromise as Singapore has better alternatives.<br><br>'It is not an exaggeration to say that allowing the RSAF the use of Malaysian airspace is 10 times better than the water supply obtained by the Republic at the current rate of three sen per gallon.<br><br>'Owing to the current problem of airspace, the RSAF is forced to keep almost 40 per cent of its military assets overseas, in countries such as the US and Australia.<br><br>'From the military strategy aspect this is not good. In the event of an emergency in Singapore, the process of transporting RSAF assets such as fighter jets would obviously take time and make it hard for RSAF to react.<br><br>'However, with their large defence allocation and current expertise, Singapore certainly can resolve its airspace problem and not depend on Malaysia.'<br>------------------------------------------<br><br>Ah.....I thought we use their Air space because it provides a better access to South China Sea for training?<br><br>We got use their air space for training <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_question.gif" alt="Question" title="Question"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>From whats being printed so far on the subject, Malaysia has a fear that if Singapore is allowed to use their airspace then Singapore will be able to have most of its fighter planes &amp; helicopter station back on local soil which therefore threaten Malaysia position to be arrogant &amp; dominating.<br><br>However, Malaysia should be lucky that their current Prime Minister is a far wiser man then his predecessor &amp; most of his fellow country men.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br><br>There may those who feel that my judgment of Malaysian being arrogant &amp; dominating is wrong or baseless.  Then let me ask you how has Malaysia policies in the past have been with its neighbours beside Singapore?  The 1997 Asia financial crisis is also partly the outcome of Malaysia's policy gone wrong.  Oh! And I know for certain that some Russian friends of mine aren't too happy about the fact that Malaysia cheated them when Malaysia firstly purchase MIG fighters from the new Russia, which was in need of cash then, with half payment made in palm oil.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>So in reality, Malaysia government would carry out their international policy in the same attitude no difference from how the U.S, Singapore &amp; the rest of the world would.  And that is to place the interest &amp; the benifits of their own country ahead of others.  There shouldn't be any hard feelings of any kind, its just politics.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_twisted.gif" alt="Twisted Evil" title="Twisted Evil"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>The impact of not allowing RSAF to use Johore airspace is huge. The reason is that if our military planes have to take -off on a southerly route, this would disrupt our civilian airspace into Changi. If you notice when flying on a commercial flight, all the approaches into Changi are via the southern islands. Even the flights from KL will route through the straits of Singapore and will not fly directly over northern Singapore.<br><br>There will be a big economic impact. The Malaysian government is not stupid. Their ultimate aim is to cause some economic trouble. The Malaysians have always wanted to control the civilian airspace over the Peninsula , Singapore and the southern Indonesian islands. However, Singapore has always established itself as the centre for civil aviation traffic control, which is a key commercial  advantage. With this advantage, we can claim to be a major aviation hub.</div>

However, the ability of the RSAF to respond in a larger formation of fighters at any given momment is a reasonable concern for Malaysia but childish.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"></div>

An innocent officer was arrested &amp; later released.<br><br>The probability of a terrorist joinning a recognised military for trainning is not rediculars but rather its something of great concern.  There are many reasons to it but I'm sure you can figure it out yourself.
