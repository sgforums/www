            <div class='col-md body'>US intelligence relied on old data in assessing Iraqi weapons<br>ADVERTISEMENT<br>Eminem Justin Timberlake Busted Blue Linkin Park T.A.T.U. 50 Cent Avril Lavigne Evanescence Lisa Maffia Madonna<br><br>A CIA internal review panel has concluded that US intelligence analysts lacked new, hard information about Iraqi weapons of mass destruction after UN inspectors left Iraq in 1998 and relied on data from the early and mid-1990s in the run-up to the Iraq war, The Washington Post reported.<br><br>The newspaper said the Central Intelligence Agency's findings that the biological, chemical and nuclear programs were still being pursued by the government of Iraqi president Saddam Hussein in 2003 were based primarily on this old information.<br><br>However, despite the fact that the post-1998 evidence was largely circumstantial or "inferential," the panel believes the CIA's conclusion that Saddam continued to have weapons of mass destruction was likely justified, according to the report.<br><br>"It would have been very hard to conclude those programs were not continuing, based on the reports being gathered in recent years about Iraqi purchases and other activities before the war," the Post quotes Richard Kerr, a former CIA deputy director who heads the four-person review panel appointed in February by CIA Director George Tenet, as saying.<br><br>Kerr said the prewar intelligence reports given to the Bush administration by the CIA, the Pentagon and State Department contained caveats and disagreements on data underlying some judgments, such as whether Iraq's nuclear program was being reconstituted, according to the paper.<br><br>But "on the whole, the analysts were pretty much on the mark," it quotes Kerr as saying.<br><br>Iraq's alleged possession of weapons of mass destruction was President George W. Bush's prime rationale for launching an invasion of Iraq on March 20.<br><br>On another controversial Iraq intelligence issue, the preliminary report indicates that although the al-Qaeda terror network and Saddam Hussein had a common enemy in the United States, "it was not at all clear there was any coordination or joint activities," said the Post, quoting an individual inside the CIA familiar with the report.<br><br>"There were people talking to each other," in Iraq and other countries, the paper quotes this individual as saying, "but that was how Saddam kept track of what was going on" in al-Qaeda, the report said.<br><br>A US official queried by AFP about the findings said the panel had so far produced only a draft report.<br><br>"The draft report indicates that Iraq was pursuing a weapons of mass destruction program, and the analysis of that program did not change in the intelligence community or at CIA as the war approached," said the official, who spoke on condition of anonymity.<br><br>The official said even with all the criticism of its reporting, the CIA's conclusion about Saddam Hussein's arsenal was "unlikely" to change.<br><br>---------------------------------------------------------------------------<br><br>Not a very positive sign. . . I've been in agreement with US actions so far. . . but this is swaying me. . .<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I agree with Viper52 here. Saddam Hussein was an evil SOB and I am glad he is gone. But the end does not justify the means. It is hard to figure out whose actions are more evil. Saddam was a cruel, sadistic kleptocrat who inflicted pain and misery on his countrymen. The Bush Administration is composed of calculating liars who have shown their willingness to bring war and death upon the world in their quest for domination. They are even talking about denying access to space for all other nations but the US now. I don't know what to think anymore.</div>

It implies an aim, perhaps a capability, but not necessarily the possession of these weapons.<br><br>Back in September, when the IISS issued its own influential report on Iraq just ahead of similar ones from the British Government and the CIA, its assessment was more definite. The word "arsenal" was used:<br><br>"This Strategic Dossier does not attempt to make a case, either way, as to whether Saddam Hussein's WMD arsenal is a casus belli per se."<br><br>Evidence of intention<br><br>The current aim of the US and British Governments is not so much to find actual Iraqi weapons but evidence of Iraqi intentions. They have a team of experts, known as the Iraq Survey Group, roaming the country and questioning scientists.<br><br>Reliable indications that Iraq intended to defy the UN and secretly develop chemical or biological weapons, even if on a relatively small scale, would go a long way to justifying their position.<br><br>Two recent finds have been brought to the jury's attention. The first is the discovery of a truck which was seized by Kurdish forces near Mosul in late April. The CIA website declares unambiguously that this truck (and other vehicles found elsewhere in Iraq) constitute "Iraqi Mobile Biological Warfare Agent Production Plants".<br><br>However, there are sceptics. The New York Times concluded in an editorial: "It is difficult to know for sure whether these mobile units were part of a program to produce unconventional weapons or served a more benign purpose."<br><br>Then more recently, it was announced that an Iraq scientist had led US forces to his rose garden under which he had buried a barrel containing the blueprints of a centrifuge for separating enriched uranium.<br><br>He had, he said, been ordered to do this after the first Gulf War of 1991. The implication is that the Iraqi Government was trying to maintain an ability to enrich uranium, without which it could not build a nuclear bomb.<br><br>The question that arises, however, is whether this was an old plan or an active one. If active, it would be highly significant.<br><br>Inspector's doubts<br><br>For some, the failure to find any weapons is pretty conclusive already. A former UN weapons inspector, Steve Allinson, a British trained chemical engineer now living in New Zealand, told the BBC that he felt "vindicated" in doubting that Iraq had any weapons of mass destruction.<br><br>He said that when he returned to Iraq during the searches earlier this year, places he had inspected on previous visits "had hardly changed, except that their infrastructure had degraded". He was "not very surprised" that nothing definite had been found so far.<br><br>Several key allegations have been found to be either unfounded or lacking substance. Chemical and biological material unaccounted for has not been discovered in weapons form. It is still simply unaccounted for.<br><br>A British claim, later repeated by President George W Bush, that Iraq had tried to buy uranium from an African country (Niger) was not supported either by the International Atomic Energy Agency or by a former American diplomat, Joseph Wilson, who was told to look into it.<br><br>Mr Wilson concluded that it was "highly doubtful" that a transaction had taken place. He further concluded, in an interview with NBC, that "some of the intelligence related to Iraq's nuclear weapons programme was twisted to exaggerate the Iraqi threat".<br><br>These remarks are among the strongest made by a domestic critic about the Bush administration which has been relatively insulated from criticism.<br><br>Nothing has been found to back up the British Government's claim that Iraq was ready to deploy some weapons within 45 minutes. Nor have any Scud missiles been discovered, despite claims that Iraq had up to twenty of them.<br><br>The case for the prosecution will not be complete until the task of the Iraq Survey group has been finished.<br><br>Dr Chipman suggested that it might take 18 months to two years for them to conclude their investigations<br></div>

Some of the Fedayeen get them to distract us, then they attack us. I mean, using kids!"<br><br>When asked if he would prefer to be part of an international force, he doesn't hesitate.<br><br>"Yes. That would help," he says.<br><br>Difficult conditions<br><br>It was midnight, two hours past curfew, but the heat was almost as impressive, and oppressive, as it had been in the daytime.<br><br>The soldier stepped out of the humvee, his face sweating.<br><br>The US troops who work on the streets and the checkpoints wear their body armour at all times.<br><br>He revealed a little of the conditions the army were working under.<br><br>"It's terrible. We're sleeping in this heat without any air-conditioning. I just wake up in a puddle of sweat every morning... and they're not giving us enough water, just a bottle a day!"<br><br>The soldiers here expected gratitude for removing a tyrant who exploited and abused his people. But speaking to Iraqis, one gets a sense of their immense pride, and the scale of the humiliation they feel at having foreigners on their soil, running their country.<br><br></div>
