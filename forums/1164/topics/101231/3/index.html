            <div class='col-md body'>Did anyone read about the news on the last few hours of Saddam's son?  How he was finally killed in an apartment.  If I remembered it correctly, the building was about only 3 or 5 stories high.  The U.S army had to use about 4 .50cal mounted Humvees, at least 2 humvees with TOW/ Stinger launcher firing at least 2 or 4 missile into where Saddam's son was located, about a battalion of infantry men &amp; at least 2 teams of SpecOps.  A mini bird was also used to fire missiles &amp; other ammos. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_twisted.gif" alt="Twisted Evil" title="Twisted Evil"><br>Saddam's son was still able to hold his ground for quite sometime.   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_evil.gif" alt="Evil or Very Mad" title="Evil or Very Mad"><br><br>So does Singapore Armed Forces have a plan if they ever encounter a similar situation as the one mentioned aboved?  Ah yes, the last option of the U.S military commander on the ground was to brig down the whole building, hopefully killing Saddam's son in it.  Of course, it never came to that option.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by John Ching:</div><div class="quote_body">Did anyone read about the news on the last few hours of Saddam's son?  How he was finally killed in an apartment.  If I remembered it correctly, the building was about only 3 or 5 stories high.  The U.S army had to use about 4 .50cal mounted Humvees, at least 2 humvees with TOW/ Stinger launcher firing at least 2 or 4 missile into where Saddam's son was located, about a battalion of infantry men &amp; at least 2 teams of SpecOps.  A mini bird was also used to fire missiles &amp; other ammos. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_twisted.gif" alt="Twisted Evil" title="Twisted Evil"><br>Saddam's son was still able to hold his ground for quite sometime.   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_evil.gif" alt="Evil or Very Mad" title="Evil or Very Mad"><br><br>So does Singapore Armed Forces have a plan if they ever encounter a similar situation as the one mentioned aboved?  Ah yes, the last option of the U.S military commander on the ground was to brig down the whole building, hopefully killing Saddam's son in it.  Of course, it never came to that option.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"> </div></blockquote>Wasn't part of the reason they needed so many men because they wanted to form a protective radius around the building to prevent him from sneaking off?<br><br>IMHO, in a real urban conflict, you probably wouldn't spend so much resources ensuring that single combatants don't escape.</div>
