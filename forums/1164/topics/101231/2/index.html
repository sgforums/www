            <div class='col-md body'>MOUT...Some rules.<br><br><strong>1-5. FUNDAMENTALS OF URBAN OPERATIONS</strong><br><br>The fundamentals described in this paragraph apply to UO regardless of the mission or geographical location. Some fundamentals may also apply to operations not conducted in an urban environment, but are particularly relevant in an environment dominated by manmade structures and a dense noncombatant population. Brigade and battalion commanders and staffs should use these fundamentals when planning UO.<br><br>a. <strong>Perform Focused Information Operations and Aggressive Intelligence, Surveillance, Reconnaissance</strong>. Information superiority efforts aimed at influencing non-Army sources of information are critical in UO. Because of the density of noncombatants and information sources, the media, the public, allies, coalition partners, neutral nations, and strategic leadership will likely scrutinize how units participate in UO. The proliferation of cell phones, Internet capability, and media outlets ensure close observation of unit activities. With information sources rapidly expanding, public information of Army operations will be available faster than the internal military information system (INFOSYS) can process it. Units can aggressively integrate information operations into every facet and at all levels of the operation to prevent negative impacts. Under media scrutiny, the actions of a single soldier may have significant strategic implications. The goal of information operations is to ensure that the information available to all interested parties, the public, the media, and other agencies, is accurate and placed in the proper context of the Army's mission. While many information operations will be planned at levels above the brigade, tactical units conducting UO may often be involved in the execution of information operations such as military deception, operations security (OPSEC), physical security, and psychological operations. Brigades and battalions must conduct aggressive intelligence, security, and reconnaissance operations that will allow them to properly apply the elements of assess, shape, dominate, and transition to specific UO.<br><br>b. <strong>Conduct Close Combat</strong>. Close combat is required in offensive and defensive UO. The capability must be present and visible in stability UO and may be required, by exception, in support UO. Close combat in any UO is resource intensive, requires properly trained and equipped forces, has the potential for high casualties, and can achieve decisive results when properly conducted. Units must always be prepared to conduct close combat as part of UO (Figure 1-4).<br><br>c. <strong>Avoid the Attrition Approach</strong>. Previous doctrine was inclined towards a systematic linear approach to urban combat. This approach placed an emphasis on standoff weapons and firepower. It can result in significant collateral damage, a lengthy operation, and be inconsistent with the political situation and strategic objectives. Enemy forces that defend urban areas often want units to adopt this approach because of the likely costs in resources. Commanders should only consider this tactical approach to urban combat only when the factors of METT-TC warrant its use.<br><br>d. <strong>Control the Essential</strong>. Many modern urban areas are too large to be completely occupied or even effectively controlled. Therefore, units must focus their efforts on controlling only the essentials to mission accomplishment. At a minimum, this requires control of key terrain (Figure 1-5). The definition of key terrain remains standard: terrain whose possession or control provides a marked advantage to one side or another. In the urban environment, functional, political, or social significance may be what makes terrain key. For example, a power station or a building may be key terrain. Units focus on control of the essential so they can concentrate combat power where it is needed and conserve it. This implies risk in those areas where units choose not to exercise control in order to be able to mass overwhelming power where it is needed.<br><br>Read more at this site..<br><a href="http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/library/policy/army/fm/3-06-11/ch1.htm#par3" rel="nofollow">http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/library/policy/army/fm/3-06-11/ch1.htm#par3</a></div>

GRAY THE ASSOCIATED PRESS<br><br>Posted on Monday, November 8, 2004<br><br>BAQOUBA, Iraq Â— By the light of flashlights and a crescent moon, the three-member crew catapults a 300-pound pilotless airplane into the sky.<br><br>Minutes later, other U.S. soldiers behind a computer screen inside a shed monitor video images from the plane, known as a Shadow, as it loiters over a traffic circle frequently attacked by insurgent bombers. "We fill some of the gaps in the intelligence field. We put one of these in harmÂ’s way instead of a soldier. ItÂ’s all about saving lives," said Sgt. Francisco Huereque, who is in charge of the nightÂ’s launch.<br><br>Unmanned aerial vehicles and other "stand-off" weapons, whether currently used or in secret testing, belong to a developing high-tech arsenal that the U.S. military says will help minimize casualties as it battles insurgents.<br><br>Most of the systems are available for continued, if not intensified, use as Iraqi forces train to take over the bulk of combat operations from the Americans Â— though when that will happen remains uncertain.<br><br>More than 1,120 U.S. soldiers have died in the Iraq war at a current rate of more than two each day.<br><br>In units like the 3 rd Brigade, 1 st Infantry Division, several surveillance drones and specially equipped terrestrial vehicles are deployed daily to protect soldiers against what persists as the deadliest killer Â— roadside explosives.<br><br>An armored, tractorlike vehicle called the Meerkat is often dispatched to detect suspected improvised explosive devices, while soldiers stand safely back. The South African-made vehicle, which can be driven by a soldier or operated by remote control, can withstand the simultaneous blast of three antitank mines, said Staff Sgt. Darrell Theurer, a Bismarck, N. D., native.<br><br>Combing the roads around this provincial capital 35 miles north of Baghdad, TheurerÂ’s unit also trots out the Buffalo, a massive, heavily armored machine that can run Meerkats by remote control and plow through a minefield to scoop up explosives with its retractable arm.<br><br>In other missions, robots are called in to shoot video of the insides of cars suspected of carrying bombs.<br><br>The life-protecting technologies extend to the airwaves.<br><br>A system installed in humvees called Warlock, made by EDO Corp. of New York, can jam signals from mobile telephones, garage-door openers and other remote-control devices used by insurgents to detonate explosives.<br><br>Officers say that without such technologies, casualties would unquestionably be higher.<br><br>The Pentagon estimates that 40 percent of improvised explosive devices are now discovered before rebels set them off.<br><br>Higher up the military chain from the brigade, still-classified technology to ferret out roadside bombs is being tried out. In the wings are other intelligence-gatherers that may or may not make it to the Iraqi battlefield.<br><br>On the ground, other new unmanned vehicles are expected to enter the field in coming years.<br><br>Among them is the Military RGator, built by tractor-maker Deere &amp; Co. and iRobot, which makes the far smaller remotecontrolled PackBot robots already deployed to scout out dangerous locations and dispose of explosives.<br><br>The R-Gator, set to begin full production in 2006, will be autonomous, meaning it will navigate and perform some tasks without any input from humans.<br><br>In the air, military officials are investigating the use of stationary, spherical "spy in the sky" airships and a digital camera packed into a mortar shell that transmits photos to a soldierÂ’s laptop while the shell floats to the ground attached to a parachute.<br><br>Unmanned aerial vehicles were flying over Iraq even before the war began and now range from the high-altitude, very sophisticated Global Hawk to the Raven, which comes in a carrying case and is launched by just flipping it into the air.<br><br>The tiny Raven is 3 feet long, with a wingspan of 4 1/2 feet and weighing 4 pounds. It can fly as far away as nine miles and stay in the air for 80 minutes.<br><br>Military officials will not reveal the total number of unmanned aerial vehicles being used in Iraq, citing operational security.<br><br>But Loren Thompson, a military analyst at the Lexington Institute think tank in Washington, said he has heard that unmanned aerial vehicles across all branches are performing about 400 sorties a day in Iraq.<br><br>The U.S. Army Soldier Systems Center in Natick, Mass., which developed the Raven, said in May that more than 100 of the tiny unmanned aerial vehicles were being deployed this year in Iraq and Afghanistan.<br><br>It is clear from the troops on the ground that they will take as many as they can get. "ItÂ’s such a sought-after commodity, they canÂ’t churn them out fast enough," said Sgt. Michael Lucas, a pilotless-craft mission commander from Jerseyville, Ill. Soldiers are also streaming out of the nine-month unmanned aerial vehicles training school.<br><br>This brigade operates four Shadows, which are used mainly to snoop for roadside explosives, car bombs, rebel mortar positions, urban snipers and insurgents who might be stalking U.S. convoys.<br><br>Soldiers with Huereque, who is from Prineville, Ore., say a Shadow will be in the air 45 minutes after an order is given, much quicker than it takes for the unit to receive images from satellites.<br><br>One Shadow recently tracked a van driving from a mortar emplacement as it dropped off four individuals at various points before arriving at a house.<br><br>Alerted about what the Shadow had seen, ground troops moved in to round up six insurgents who were carrying incriminating evidence: the insurgentsÂ’ own video of mortars being fired at U.S. bases, said 2 nd Lt. Liesel Himmelberger, who monitors real-time images from unmanned aerial vehicles in the brigadeÂ’s operation center.<br><br>It is also suspected that as a unmanned aerial vehicle flies overhead, its mere sound Â— described as "a lawnmower on steroids" Â— might help save lives. "If youÂ’re doing something nasty and you have one buzzing over your head at 5,000 feet, you might just break off," said Himmelberger, of Newburgh, N. Y.<br><br>The brigadeÂ’s intelligence officer, Maj. Kreg Schnell, said the unit that replaces his when it leaves Iraq in February will be more digitally advanced.<br><br>But Schnell, from Seattle, is skeptical about how many lives can be saved as the Americans seek to put more unmanned machines in the line of fire and relegate soldiers to the role of intelligence collectors. "ItÂ’s a force-oriented enemy that will still come after us," Schnell predicted. "Economic and political well-being for the Iraqis, that will save American lives."<br><br><a href="http://www.nwanews.com/story.php?paper=adg%C3%82%C2%A7ion=Business&amp;storyid=98252" rel="nofollow">http://www.nwanews.com/story.php?paper=adgÂ§ion=Business&amp;storyid=98252</a><br><br>~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br><br>I believe it was reported that 3 SIR are also doing such evalaution for future urban warfare! <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"><br><br>I am sure it will be something similar to what US is doing in ME.<br><br>The future FIBUA tactics will be quite different as compare to how we are trained now. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>The way I see it, MINDEF's recent priorities have been to find new training areas for the air force &amp; mechanized outfits (armour, arty). The way the overseas stints for the land-based forces are structured is thus: repeated drilling of small- &amp; company-sized unit tactics locally, then put them in a unfamiliarly foreign setting &amp; let them apply what they've learnt.<br><br>No reason why this cannot be applied for infantry in urban scenarios too (even as they undergo jungle training), though I think it'll only come alongside the DSTA innovations for the 3G trooper. You know, rifles that shoot around corners, etc.<br><br>In terms of FIBUA skills, the manner of exponentially expand it out is via "street fighting," with securing of certain buildings at certain chokepoints the mission objective. It won't be anything like the street-for-street engagements of the Stalingrad intensity, or the fantastic idea of guerilla-fighting through every floor of an entire HDB estate. That's unrealistic training.<br><br>Thus, even as we diligently rote-practice at the FIBUA village, ideally there should be a "alien" village or town setting where the trained troops could occasionally be sent into to improvise on the fly. That's what we're doing with Ex Lancer, Crescendo, Wallaby, et al. but is it too politically sensitive (or unpractical itself) to organize such an urban setting in these countries?<br><br>As said, maybe India can afford a blank-slate start for us.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>The SAF with DSTA has developed what they call a FIBUA Ball,it is essentially a remote controlled ball-like object which can revolve,roll etc via remote control.Honestly,I think its a pretty cool idea,but its bout the size of a small coconut.I suggest that fibre-optic cables which have a video-link capability and are able to sneak into tiny corners,windows etc will be better.<br><br>Guys,you know that HDB has been saying that they wanna buil houses modularly...as in the home owners can change where they place walls in their flat etc...why not incorporate this into the FIBUA village?It will be more realistic and gives troopers better ability to react to scenarios which they are unfamiliar with,making them think on their feet.<br><br>Lastly,does anyone have any idea will SAF conduct actual FIBUA the way the US are doing in Iraq now?Using flashbangs,grenades etc...?Or the old way,grenades only?</div>
