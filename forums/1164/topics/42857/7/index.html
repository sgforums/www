            <div class='col-md body'>People who are rock dumb but act as if they had any sort of reason to justify the things they believe never fail to push buttons here.<br><br>I believe the bottom line should be, if you know nothing much about what you are talking about, you better not say it, much less insist on it. And that's what this joker is doing here... in every incident from PT-91 to Mog. to Seawolf SAMs, this individual has demostrated a complete lack of understanding of the subject matter choosing to take the baby-food facts that his govt. has fed him, and of course they will be contradicted.<br><br>But at the very least he should exercise his sense of logic and bother to see the facts as they really are, and that is his Malaysian "armed" forces are not anywhere near as good as they crack themselves out to be. What seems to be the case here is, utter hyprocitical behaviour. He laughs at the people who died in Courageous (even saying these women deserved to die), but gets angry when we mention that johnny english pilot. And everytime he's in a fix to justify his points, his basic line of argument (which is almost always false is<img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>"My OFFICAL govt. report says so, so that's it"<br><br>"You are no better yourself"<br><br>"At least I am better then you"<br><br>Now, are any of these threads or response or reasoning indicative of a working logic center, or is it just a person who knows nuts but goes into "bring it on" mode whenever people simply state the facts. This is one joker who deserves to be flamed and rightly so, if he can't be bothered to be civil enough to at least engage people here in decent conversation instead of basically posting things that are "malaysia boleh, you better agree if not I'll bring you on a merry go round of infantile insults and arguments."<br><br>And of course, when he has nothing to say because the logic is overwhelming, he either stonewalls or makes sweeping, baseless statements like "you are not fit to debate with me" WITHOUT EVEN BOTHERING TO ADDRESS THE TONS OF INFORMATION PUT OUT IN CONTRAY TO HIS WEAK-MINDED VIEWS.<br><br>I think the general level of competency and maturity in this forum is far above people like him, and I don't see why we have to tolerate his nonsense everytime he come in here to promote his bucket organization. My suggestion is, when he gets boleh, we send him balick kumpong<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>The bottom line is, the preformance of the Malaysians were hardly anywhere near as stellar as they would like to claim. Esp. when they make it seem as if they were the big grandose heroic saviors of the poor besieged american soldiers and came in guns-a-blazing to rescue those poor darlings from their own mess.<br><br>A impression I find laughable. It was remarkable that they decided to be involved when they didn't have a dog in the fight but the follow up gutter about them being heroic belongs in to malaysian fiction. The Malaysian mission in Mog was to extract the americans soldiers, and apparently they did not do that mission anywhere near as well as they'd like to claim.<br><br>The thing here is, dun say you're something you're not. If they said the mission in Mog. was a extraction undertaken by some of their forces and gave a bare bones fact account of what when right and what went wrong, like what most sensible armed forces do, that'll be fine. Nobody will fault them for screwing up, this is war after all.<br><br>But have they done anything like this? If anything, their attitude towards Mog. was as if the entire world owes them some big favour and should forever hold them in awe on the "heroic" selflessness of their men. Phui man! If anything, they have not treated this account of battle with the respect it deserves and hyped it into some kind of gawdy national icon like their Michell Yeo, which it's not.<br><br>Did the Allies take Omaha beach? Yes. But did they make several collosal screw ups in that process? Of course. Everything from underestimating the german defences to DD tanks sinking. And do they remember that incident like Malaysia? Not a chance. Any account you read about Omaha will mention about the tons of screw ups they made, even though they finally achieved their objectives.<br><br>What some people up north wants the world to swallow is that their preformance in Mog. was heroic and peerless in execeution...

Pleeuzeee...</div></blockquote>i dunno where you saw the claim that the guys up north were heroic and peerless in execution ...certainly not from the Malaysian Government!<br>Neither did they ever publicise it or blow their trumpet in movies or in any books. Probably some overzealous guys may overstate the role....but not the government.<br><br>I believe it all started with Mark Bowden's book. You should know that in Mog, the Rangers were not the top dogs ...the honour went to the Delta Force! Being 2nd best, these guys seem to think anyone else are damn lousy including their own QRF, the 10th Mountain Div!<br>Somehow, guys in No. 2 spot always seems to have a chip on their shoulder.<br>So when they screw up in Mog, everyone is to blame including the 10th Mountain Div, the so-called "fresh troops" who took the ride back on the M'sian APCs instead of giving up their seats to the tired Rangers.<br><br>Only when the misinformation was published in the books and some US papers, did the M'sian Government made the clarification.<br>I don't think there was any boasting on their part except when some jokers who bought the misinformation and start disparaging the M'sians wrongly.<br><br>This includes yourself....how can the M'sian be cowering like cowards in the APCs, when no M'sian infantrymen participated !<br>the M'sian must be in the APC becoz they were the drivers and the gunners ie. APC crewmen....surely they are not suppose to abndone their vehicle !<br><br>They may not be the heroes but their contribution certainly made the difference between life and death to alot of US Rangers.<br>This contribution was acknowledge by none other than US General Montgomery.<br><br>I think Gen Montgomery has far more credibility than you who have no combat experience at all except particpating in flaming war.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>And they certainly acted "professional" when they behaved like Fann Wong fans complaining that their screen time was insufficent.<br><br>On the other hand, we dun see the Pakistanis and others involved complaining when they did not appear on screen more then a shot of a M-48 rolling down the streets.<br><br>Said and done, the Malaysian APC crews did not have a particularly heroic or remarkable run in Mog. Certainly nothing of the propangadic ammunition they like to use. Lanugage problems aside, as much as people would like to pay lip service and say the typical "selfless, heroic and professional" rethoric that should apply to all soldiers, the Malaysians are kidding themselves if they think that the experience in Mog. showed that there is no large amount of improvement required in their forces, esp when it comes to the area of learning proper english and thinking on their feet and prehaps having a little bit of battlefield intelligence.<br><br>And as much as I respect General Monty, look at it logically. Would any commander in that situtation screw up the malaysians in their report? Not unless the malaysians screwed up completely and were routed that is. But they managed to stagger back with the Rangers, anybody in Monty's position would be grateful, irregardless of how botched the extraction was.<br><br>But rethoric and politics aside, it is obvious, from the tatical point of view that the malaysians' preformance in Mog. left a lot to be desired.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Slanderous? Hardly...<br><br>It's easy to hide inside an APC safe frome bullets and hope no RPG come through like the Lt. in Band of Brothers and claim hero later for driving some people back. Granted, no role is too small but common sense needs to be applied when assigning credit. In which case the Malaysians should pride themselves for having good battle chaffuers (those that drive off leaving some of those they were supposed to extract behind on foot) rather then fighting troops. Hey, I'm not saying it's their fault, that's war anyway.<br><br>It was the people on the ground doing the footwork and shooting back that were the ones really risking their lives. As botched and pointless the entire thing might seem. And it seems the credit they are getting here from you is "they screwed up, they screwed up."<br><br>I think the chorus resounding against you from them would be "screw you!"</div>
