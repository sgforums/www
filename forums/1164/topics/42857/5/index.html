This is not possible, either way, the MAF will screw up.<br><br>If this is the "typical" error you suggested, it means two things.<br><br>The MAF screwed up in getting such aircraft in poor shape that will come apart in mid air, hence it's not smart in getting weapons, it just wants the nicest, not the smartest toys to show off.<br><br>The MAF ground crew is so imcompetent that it was unable to fix this "typical' technical fault.<br><br>But of course, this "typical" technical error is hardly typical at all, if this was typical, your stupid MAL aircraft would be falling out of the skies killing thousands and you would still blame it on "typical" errors. Typical errors are in the likes of engine trouble or like hydraulic pressure low, when it plane crashes and your "pilots" need a nylon let down, this is not "typical" at all! These planes are designed to go to extreme conditions and limits and do so for <span style="font-style: italic;">years</span> without fail and you are trying to say here that one brand new purchase and cream of the crop falls out of the sky it is typical? Yeah, as if an F-22 crashes, the US wun look into it and write it off as "typical". Please....<br><br>What is apparent here is however, the MAF just can't take care of it's aircraft! That's why crap happens to them, and so often as well! Simple as that! There's a lot they can do to avoid these kinds of screw ups, just look at the RSAF which strives to be accident free, and they have had a pretty good record.<br><br>Unless the MAF has been taking RSAF like measures to ensure aircrew safety, you better shut your mouth and do some serious soul searching before you blame it on your glitzy new aircraft that somehow comes apart around you because you either made the wrong purchase or dun know how to take care of it.<br><br>What you and your MAF is doing now is typical malaysian... bad workmen blaming the tools... sorry, if you dunno how to handle it, dun blame it when you get hurt by it.<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"></div>

Sorry, but it just won't work. Hello, you think your govt. who touts PT-91s as most advanced and everything good, good good in the military will admit to even a bit of error in this crash? I suggest you use your brain and think a little.<br><br>We are not making up stuff to counter you, what is happening is that we are questioning your logic in this thread, which is, like the "PT-91 is one of the most advanced tanks in the world" is extremely weak, typical MSS Malaysian style.   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br>Innocent Malaysian, what you are asking us to accept is that the mig crashing was just a "typical" technical error and that the MAF did not screw up. This is not possible, either way, the MAF will screw up.<br><br>If this is the "typical" error you suggested, it means two things.<br><br>The MAF screwed up in getting such aircraft in poor shape that will come apart in mid air, hence it's not smart in getting weapons, it just wants the nicest, not the smartest toys to show off.<br><br>The MAF ground crew is so imcompetent that it was unable to fix this "typical' technical fault.<br><br>But of course, this "typical" technical error is hardly typical at all, if this was typical, your stupid MAL aircraft would be falling out of the skies killing thousands and you would still blame it on "typical" errors. Typical errors are in the likes of engine trouble or like hydraulic pressure low, when it plane crashes and your "pilots" need a nylon let down, this is not "typical" at all! These planes are designed to go to extreme conditions and limits and do so for <span style="font-style: italic;">years</span> without fail and you are trying to say here that one brand new purchase and cream of the crop falls out of the sky it is typical? Yeah, as if an F-22 crashes, the US wun look into it and write it off as "typical". Please....<br><br>What is apparent here is however, the MAF just can't take care of it's aircraft! That's why crap happens to them, and so often as well! Simple as that! There's a lot they can do to avoid these kinds of screw ups, just look at the RSAF which strives to be accident free, and they have had a pretty good record.<br><br>Unless the MAF has been taking RSAF like measures to ensure aircrew safety, you better shut your mouth and do some serious soul searching before you blame it on your glitzy new aircraft that somehow comes apart around you because you either made the wrong purchase or dun know how to take care of it.<br><br>What you and your MAF is doing now is typical malaysian... bad workmen blaming the tools... sorry, if you dunno how to handle it, dun blame it when you get hurt by it.<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"> </div></blockquote>No i think he meant errors like this are typical technical errors that the MAF makes......makes me wonder what are the non-typical errors! <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_confused.gif" alt="Confused" title="Confused"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Innocent Malaysian, it's crunch time for you... respond to this. Are you still going to justify your armed forces as anything near competent or heroic, given all the things that have been exposed here? They are as follows:<br><br>The dismal preformance of the malaysian soldiers in Mog which the malaysian govt. played up as heros. Soldiers which simply drove their apcs up, virtually ignored orders given to them to shoot back or move to avoid attracting fire, or stop to give cover, and even drove off with their fresh troops inside while many of the rangers (many injured and some even shot up) which had fought 16 hours they were supposed to fery home were forced to run back on foot behind them, exposed to fire all the way. And later this is played as anykind of a sucessful extraction by the malaysians when in actual fact they deserve to be court-martialed for cowardace.<br><br>Allowing some mad man dressed as a colonel to take arms from their high-security armory.<br><br>Shoot their own pilot through the roof.<br><br>Crash their cream of the crop migs, and explain it as a "typical error"<br><br>Tout the PT-91 as one of the most advanced tanks in the world, while the rest of the world shake their heads.<br><br>Let two of their ships catch fire while in dock because some cook could not control his stove and some engineer cannot figure out his engine?<br><br>Mount obsolute SAM systems on their two precious ships, and then tout them as if they are so powerful when in real life their preformance in combat left a lot to be desired (look around, there are many better SAM systems).<br><br>Now, are all these things consistent with a armed force that is profesional in it's conduct and has maintained a relatively mistake free operation of top rate men and equipment?<br><br>Or do you have nothing to say.<br><br>Answer the question, and don't you dare to be evasive or change the subject.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>It seems to me that the MAF is more of a tida apas force then a professional force... get the most ex toys, but they are not really professional about it.
