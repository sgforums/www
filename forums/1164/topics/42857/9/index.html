            <div class='col-md body'>It is odd that when there are more pages added to show the duration of the thread, the more digression from the original topic the discussions will develop.<br><br>The original topic read as Â“Combat Experience of our Immediate NeighborsÂ” into how effective their combat skill has added to their Â“combat experienceÂ”.<br><br>Some have even indicated that Â“Peace KeepingÂ” Duties with the United Nations may not count as Â“Combat ExperienceÂ” Â– which begs the question as to what kind of combat action count as Â“Combat ExperienceÂ”?<br><br>What if hostile acts of wars erupt suddenly in a declared Neutral Area controlled by UN Peace Keepers, and the same Peace Keepers have to return gunfire to protect themselves, and maintain the peace? Will this not count as combat experience? Or should one limit the acceptance of combat experience as one that involve military campaigns involving a military unit of no less then a Division or a Brigade or a Battalion?<br><br>Before attempting to pick-up the thread, I would prefer to describe Combat Experience as one in which any military personnel that participate in any battle, and coming under hostile fires that require his military skills in combating such hostile fires, will be sufficient to allow this personnel to have gained "Combat Experience", irregardless of the Unit Size Â– from the basic infantry team, squad, platoon, or even a Company - so long as the individual soldier has been through the Â“baptism of fireÂ”.<br><br>Combat will cover battles against insurgency, guerilla warfare, or even military campaigns of any breadth; and we should perhaps limit the Combat Experience as occurring in wars in the Twentieth Century.<br><br>With this as a base, the various countries that were mentioned as our IMMEDIATE Neighbors, with the most Combat Experience will be as follows:-<br><br>Philippines<br>The Philippines had fought against America from 1899 to 1902 and won its independence from this short war.<br><br>Her fledging Military was formed with the backing of the US Administration in the Philippines, and had fought gallantly in WW-2 against Japan, The Philippines had contributed their soldiers to fight in the Korean War, as well as throughout the Vietnam War period. It fought an insurgency war against the Communist NPA in Luzon from the early 1950s till the present date, and the Muslim insurgency in the south from the mid-1970s until the present date.

The Communists from North Vietnam, who used the territory to make up part of the HoChiMinh Trail during the Vietnam War, supported the Communist half. While the non-Communist Laotian was supported by the US, with funds supporting the regimeÂ’s military being paid from the CIA budget.<br><br>Throughout the 1960s, both sides fought major campaigns to gain the high grounds; and with the US withdrawal from the Vietnam War, the non-Communist side agreed with the Communist side not to fight amongst themselves, and unify the country under Communist rule. The military was united as a whole.<br><br>Cambodia<br>The Cambodians army is no longer existing in the form that it was during the 1950s to the 1970s; as the Military that fought in a supporting role to the USA during the Vietnam War, surrendered to Pol Pot when the USA withdrew from Indochina, and allowed Vietnam to sweep over and unified South Vietnam with the North.<br><br>The generals that ruled Cambodia, when Prince Sihanouk abdicated his rule of Cambodia and withdrew to France (and subsequently to China), then fought a short war with the Communist Khmers Rouge guerillas led by Pol Pot and swept into power, then fought against the Vietnamese Â– who could tolerate the murderous ways of Pol Pot.<br><br>The present Cambodian Army saw a limited combat action fighting against the Khmer Rouge Guerillas, and with the backing of ASEAN (especially with military hardware and supplies from Singapore), they overwhelmed the Khmer Rouge which finally was given up by PR China.<br><br>Myanmar<br>The military had fought against insurgencies guerilla groups trying to break away from the Central Government, and involve the various ethnic groups that form the majority in the outlying provinces that are far away from the Central Government in Yangon (or Rangoon).<br><br>These wars were fought since before the war with the Japanese during WW-2, which formed a short interval before full scale campaigns were launched.<br><br>The insurgents soon realized that they had to resort to the sale of drugs to obtain funds to purchase weapons and ammunitions, and they soon found this to be a useful objective to fight for independence from the Central Government in Yangon.<br><br>The wars have been fought since the late 1940s till the present date, with several ethnic groups already at peace with the Central Military Government in Yangon, and leaving only a few remaining die hard ethnic groups still fighting for independence.<br><br>The combat experience of their military is as long as that of the Vietnamese, Laotians, Cambodians and the Thais.<br><br>Indonesia<br>has seen its military in campaigns to take over territories that were left unattended by the European Colonialists, with the first being the independence of the entire Indonesian Archipelago from the Dutch, then the snatching of West Timor and Irian Jaya from the Portuguese.<br><br>In the course of it, the Indonesia military had to fight the local guerilla wars with the local ethnic populations that are genetically different from the Malay-Bugis origins of the main stream Indonesian population.<br><br>The ambitions of the first Indonesian President was challenged by the vision of the formation of Malaysia, and a low scale war of insurgency was fought Â– called Konfrontasi, and largely involved the British Military.<br><br>In the mid 1970s, Indonesia had also to contend with the call from independence from its northern province of Acheh, and several major military campaigns were launched to fight the Â“religious armyÂ” of Acheh that were fighting a guerilla war.<br><br>A Study of the Indonesian Armed Forces<br><a href="http://www.aph.gov.au/library/pubs/rp/1998-99/99rp23.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.aph.gov.au/library/pubs/rp/1998-99/99rp23.htm</a><br><br>Unofficial Web Site of Indonesian Armed Forces<br><a href="http://indoforce.tripod.com/" rel="nofollow">http://indoforce.tripod.com/</a><br><br>Malaysia<br>Her Armed Forces did not exist during WW-2, and a fledging army supported the British Military, which contributed the main force during the Malayan Emergency Â– which was a war against Communist Insurgency of the 1950s.<br><br>Up to the mid-1960s, the Malaysian Army did not consist more then three battalions of Royal Malay Regiment, with a light Armour Recce Battalion more for Internal Security.<br><br>During the Confrontation Campaign (Konfrontasi) with Indonesia, the British Military was the main force that formed the front line in Sarawak and Sabah, launching aggressive patrols with the SAS, Royal Marines, Commandoes, Paras, Artillery, and the Gurhkas to lay ambush along infiltration routes from Indonesian Kalimantan.<br><br>The few actions that exclusive involve local Malaysian military was the hunt for Indonesian paratroopers that jumped into Johor State, and involved also the 2nd Singapore Infantry Regiment (Merged into MAF and renamed as Malaysian Infantry Regiment) Â– who lost 9 men from an Infantry Platoon Patrol, while taking a bath with the guard on duty being careless, and allowing an Indonesian Section to ambush the Section, killing and mutilating the bodies.<br><br>2nd SIR hunted down the Indoneisans relentlessly, and every single one was killed, and the same courtesy was returned.<br><br>Singapore<br>When Singapore joined Malaysia in 1963, there already existed the 1st and 2nd Singapore Infantry Regiment , which was absorbed into the Malaysian Army Orbat when Singapore became part of Malaysia.

            <div class='col-md body'>Topic digression is nothing new. It happens to all(and I mean all) the forums I visit unless the moderators keep a ruthlessly dictatorial policy in eliminating even remotely off-topic posts.<br><br><strong>Some have even indicated that Â“Peace KeepingÂ” Duties with the United Nations may not count as Â“Combat ExperienceÂ” Â– which begs the question as to what kind of combat action count as Â“Combat ExperienceÂ”?<br><br>What if hostile acts of wars erupt suddenly in a declared Neutral Area controlled by UN Peace Keepers, and the same Peace Keepers have to return gunfire to protect themselves, and maintain the peace? Will this not count as combat experience? Or should one limit the acceptance of combat experience as one that involve military campaigns involving a military unit of no less then a Division or a Brigade or a Battalion?</strong><br><br>Good point, I see what you mean when you say that returning fire while as Blue Helmets does constitute Combat Experience, and I agree wholeheartedly. But how often do the UN peacekeepers encounter that? Places like Cyprus, where UN peacekeepers are stationed and a standing ceasefire is in place since the 70s, do not exactly provide a whole lot of combat experience. Similarly, with the exception of those who took part the firefight down in the Mog in '93, the Malaysian Army has not gotten an iota of combat time while serving under UN colours as far as I remember(I might be wrong here)<br><br><strong>Thailand -<br>as a nation had contributed troops to fight in the Korean War, as well as throughout the Vietnam War. She has also fought limited campaigns with Myanmar for a duration of a few months, but by and large, she has not been in combat too much.</strong><br><br>Don't forget border clashes took place quite often in the years of the Cambodian War (1979-1989) between Thai soldiers and forces of the Vietnamese sponsored Cambodian regime in hot pursuit of Khmer Rouge and Royalist guerillas fleeing to Thailand from cross border raids. From what I gather, the Thais came off second best quite often<br><br><strong>Cambodia<br>The Cambodians army is no longer existing in the form that it was during the 1950s to the 1970s; as the Military that fought in a supporting role to the USA during the Vietnam War, surrendered to Pol Pot when the USA withdrew from Indochina, and allowed Vietnam to sweep over and unified South Vietnam with the North.<br><br>The generals that ruled Cambodia, when Prince Sihanouk abdicated his rule of Cambodia and withdrew to France (and subsequently to China), then fought a short war with the Communist Khmers Rouge guerillas led by Pol Pot and swept into power, then fought against the Vietnamese Â– who could tolerate the murderous ways of Pol Pot.</strong><br><br>I'm assuming you meant to say "then fought against the Vietnamese Â– who couldn't tolerate the murderous ways of Pol Pot", because the Khmer Rouge fought against the US-backed military government in Cambodia till they won in 1975, when "Year Zero" began, which amid the atrocities the Khmer Rouge commited, was the systematic murder of minority Vietnamese in Cambodia, which, coupled with its(Vietnam's) expansionist ambitions, prompted Vietnam to invade Cambodia in 1979 and install a more compliant regime(that of Hun Sen). The Khmer Rouge then melted into the jungles, allying with the Royalist Forces who were in turn supported by ASEAN and China(who for differing reasons were not exactly too keen to see Vietnamese - and hence Soviet hegemony in SE Asia)<br><br><strong>The present Cambodian Army saw a limited combat action fighting against the Khmer Rouge Guerillas, and with the backing of ASEAN (especially with military hardware and supplies from Singapore), they overwhelmed the Khmer Rouge which finally was given up by PR China.</strong><br><br>Errr...seems like you got a little confused here. In 1979-1989 the Royalist Sihanouk forces were allied with the Khmer Rouge forces who fought against forces of Vietnam and the Vietnamese backed Cambodian regime of Hun Sen. China and ASEAN supported the anti-Vietnamese coalition(for lack of a better term) including the Khmer Rouge which was never overwhelmed till the peace process kicked in after 1989(which united the ex-Viet sponsored gov't and their former Royalist foes) and the Khmer Rouge leaders started kicking the proberbial bucket.<br><br>The present Cambodian army is made up of forces drawn from the Royalist and pro-Vietnamese armies. A national reconciliation army, so to speak.<br><br>But, I digress...again  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>it would be interesting to see how long can the TNI sustain its operation in Aceh. The operation in Aceh will reveal alot of information on its <span style="font-style: italic;">modus operandi</span>, tactics, organisation and effectiveness of TNI in conducting a large scale operation. After the initial propoganda i.e. paradrop and air strike intended for foreign journalists, the real show really begin......</div>
