Designated high threat targets are then <strong>automatically passed </strong>to the Seawolf tracker sub-system which then searches for and locks onto the target. The system automatically decides upon missile launch and guides the SEAWOLF missile up to intercept using highly accurate <strong>Command to Line of Sight </strong>(CLOS) guidance.<br><br>Vertically launched, the missile is turned over quickly using <strong>thrust vector control</strong>. Once the boost motor has separated, the missile is controlled by its rear fins, giving it high manoeuvrability. The rear-facing command aerials, mounted on the missile wings, make it <strong>extremely resistant to electronic countermeasures</strong>.<br><br><strong>all weather, day/night system,  </strong><br>flexible defence capability, as it can engage both incoming missiles and aircraft with its rapid fire ability and automatic re-engagement,<br>full <strong>360Â° azimuth </strong>coverage without any launcher blind arcs,<br>maximum engagement window due to its 360Â° coverage and fast, accurate and agile missile,<br>does not restrict ship manoeuvre.<br><br><strong>resistance to ECM due to the use of Command to Line of Sight (CLOS) guidance system,  </strong><br>rapid reaction time due to its fully automatic launch sequence,<br>optimized lethality with blast fragmentation warhead and proximity fuze,<br>combat proven,<br>low risk of combat damage unavailability, due to built-in redundancy.<br><br>VL SEAWOLF is the <strong>third generation</strong> in the SEAWOLF air defence weapon system and is in service in the UK Royal Navy where it is fitted in the Type 23 frigates, with 32 missiles installed in vertical sealed canisters ready for firing. It also equips the Royal Malaysian Navy for the new light frigates built by BAE SYSTEMS.<br>The UK MoD has recently contracted a further tranche of the Block 2 standard of Seawolf missile and for updates to the shipÂ’s equipments.<br>The initial version of the SEAWOLF was successfully deployed in the Falklands war (1982).<br><br><a href="http://www.mbda.net/eseawolf.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.mbda.net/eseawolf.html</a>[/b]</blockquote>U had already agreed that the missile system is old.

"Drive this thing now soldier! Shoot back! Hey don't go without us! Come back!" were just a few of the things they had to shout at the scared malaysian soldiers who can't do anything right. It's amazing only two got killed, but maybe not, considering they were hiding all the time and taking up space.<br><br>Anyway, back to topic, your seawolf sam system is nothing to be proud about... in fact your navy should be quaking in their pants and figuring out how to put more defences against the mighty RSAF that will have little trouble overcoming this basic defence system.
