Certainly nothing of the propangadic ammunition they like to use. Lanugage problems aside, as much as people would like to pay lip service and say the typical "selfless, heroic and professional" rethoric that should apply to all soldiers, the Malaysians are kidding themselves if they think that the experience in Mog. showed that there is no large amount of improvement required in their forces, esp when it comes to the area of learning proper english and thinking on their feet and prehaps having a little bit of battlefield intelligence.<br><br>And as much as I respect General Monty, look at it logically.

Or worse, present something that's entirely opposite from what really happened?<br><br>The issue here is not if the malaysians screwed up in Mog., which they did and in a major way judging from the mess during the extraction. But how they reacted to it. And sad to say, it was another declare heroic sucess and leave it at that incident.<br><br>What we are really getting at here is not the screw up the malaysians made, but rather their way of dealing with them, which is a rather paethetic array of selective memory and cover-up rethoric. I don't think anyone here would be dumb enough to laugh at their screw ups, because we have a fair share of our own. What we are laughing about is the difference in ways both sides deal with theirs.

Official reports states that miscommunication occured. It must be know that the drivers of the APC had radio contact with their own commanders, which were giving them instructions.<br>These orders may have conflicted with the actual ground situation...but then the drivers would have trouble understanding what actually the US ground troops wanted becoz of the language issue.<br><br>In anycase, inspite of the above problems, the entire rescue operation (which consisted of M'sian APC+crew, Rangers, and 10th Mountain Div), did managed to successfully extracted the trapped ranger with very little loss of life.

I found this in the book...  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br><br><blockquote>For Steele, the worst moment in the whole fight had come as they pulled away from the line of APCs, watching men climbing on board, and he saw Perino down at the end of the line step back and let Siegler in the hatch, and then, boom! the vehicles took off. There were still guys back there, Perino and others! He beat frantically on the shoulders of the APC driver, screaming at him, "ive got guys still out there!" but the MALAY driver had a tanker helmet on and acted like he didn't hear Steele and just kept on driving. The captain got on the command net. Reception was so bad inside the carrier that he could barely hear a respond, but he broadcast his alarm in disjointed phrase: -We got left back on National...The Paki vehicle were gonna follow us home, the foot soldier...but we loaded up..but we had probably fifteen or twenty still had to walk. They took off and left us. We need somebody to get down there and pick them up.<br>-Roger, i understand, Harrell had answered. I thought everybody was loaded.I got about three calls. They were telling me they were loaded. Where are they pn National?<br>-Romeo, this is Juliet. Im sending this blind.I need those soldier picked up on National ASAP!<br>In fact, Perino and the others had been picked up, but not without some trouble. The lieutenent and about six other men, Rangers and some D-boys, were the last ones on the street when what looked like the last vehicles approached. The exhausted soldiers shouted and waved but the MALAYSIAN driver paid him them no mind until one of the D-boys stepped out and leveled a CAR-15 at him. He stopped. They just piled in on top of the other men already jammed inside. </blockquote>Malaysian soldiers sure are brave! <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br><br>(PS: observe, you claim that you are Singaporean.
