            <div class='col-md body'>You dont have to be a genius to know the contribution and sacrifices of the Malaysian troops in Somalia. the extracts below were quoted from several website.s<br><br><blockquote>The 2002 movie "Black Hawk Down" was based on a book portraying the so-called "true story" of the 1993 Battle of Mogadishu. What should be clearly mentioned was the role of a Malaysian battalion serving under the UN mandate in war-torn Somalia. <strong>The 19th Royal Malay Regiment (Mechanized) unit showed great valor by rescuing 75 US troops during the chaos, costing the life of one Malaysian soldier. </strong>Also involved was a team of Pakistani soldiers.</blockquote><a href="http://uniworld1.tripod.com/Spc/Trivia-eng.html" rel="nofollow">http://uniworld1.tripod.com/Spc/Trivia-eng.html</a><br><br><blockquote>KUALA LUMPUR Â– Malaysian Defense Minister Najib Razak Tuesday voiced regret that the Hollywood movie "Black Hawk Down" ignored the sacrifices of Malaysian troops who rescued American soldiers during a battle in Somalia in 1993.<br><br>Najib said the movie based on a book failed to reflect the actual incident.<br><br>"We are disappointed with the contents of the movie. It is obvious the book ignored what actually happened. The US rangers were trapped and they were rescued by Malaysian troops," he was quoted as saying by Bernama news agency.<br><br>Najib said often movies produced by Hollywood are not based on facts but are modified to suit certain groups.<br><br>"We should not accept Hollywood (movies) completely," he said.<br><br>Eighteen US soldiers died in the battle and 70 were wounded. One Malaysian was killed and nine were wounded.<br><br>Najib's remarks came a day after a top military official criticized the movie for ignoring the role of Malaysian soldiers in the deadly battle.<br><br>"We were there in the thick of the battle," complained retired Brigadier-General Abdul Latif Ahmad, who commanded Malaysian forces serving with the United Nations in Somalia at that time.<br><br>"It is only right to set the record straight or Malaysian movie-goers will be under the wrong impression that the real battle was fought by the Americans alone while we were mere bus drivers to ferry them out."<br><br>The former commander said that, contrary to the impression given by the film, American lives were saved by a rescue force of 113 Malaysian troops deployed in 32 Condor armoured personnel carriers after two Black Hawk helicopters were shot down in Mogadishu. </blockquote><a href="http://www.inq7.net/ent/2002/jan/24/ent_1-1.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.inq7.net/ent/2002/jan/24/ent_1-1.htm</a><br><br></div>

As a matter of fact, malaysia's role in the resuce was very extra. Could be done without, but since they were there, might as well lah, let their junk apcs get shot up instead of ours. And that was what happened. Make no mistake, there were a lot of other UN units which could have extracted them, but they decided to let the cowardly malaysians go instead, to blood them a little. And whatdayaknow! they actually went in to get shot up.<br><br>Brave? More like dumb.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Actually, a lot of the rangers interviewed were quite annoyed with the malaysians for losing their guts once the bullets started flying, cowering in their APCs and not doing much, (taking up space instead) and worse, driving off leaving some of the battle weary and injured people they were supposed to extract to run behind them on foot while their fresh troops sat shivering in their apcs. The only good word they put in was that the apcs helped to attract some fire away from them, that was about as much good as they did. If it wasn't for their own injured in the APCs, the enraged at the "incompetence of the malaysians" americans might have "accidently" cooked some of the condors (basically garbage dumpsters on wheels).<br><br>As much as the malaysians would have like to complain that they did help, the fact remains as while they did commit their troops to assist, they did a pretty botched job that they should be ashamed of, not beat their chests and proclaim that they singlehandedly saved the americans... sorry, that's just not true. Heck, the UN could get more competent and battle experienced crew from other countries to drive the malaysian apcs, had they known how lously they were gonna do in mog. While the MAF is sent packing home to malaysia along with a request for some "real' soldiers.<br><br>True to their role, the MAF there was chaffuers, not warriors.<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"></div>
