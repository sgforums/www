            <div class='col-md body'>Sigh....<br><br>Folks , everyone have their own cock up , it is inevitable.<br><br>Wat differiente a efficent force and a sub-standard force is that the efficent party will try all they could to prevent cock ups sometimes even with tremdous constrints they have to face. If a suay suay cock up occur , the efficent party will sit down and analyst wat when wrong and how to prevent it in the future.<br><br>Toking abt maintainence , my school Operation Manager was from the RSAF , last friday , i manage to have a light conversation for over at hour on his experience in field. Mind mi innocent malaysia , but one of the questions was '' how well does the RSAF fare , incomparision to RMAF''.<br><br>Well his answer was simple. The working attitude of the RMAF personnel is extremely poor, if we will to compare. It took 10 Malaysian RMAF personnel to service an F-5E while it took onli 2 to 3 RSAF personnel to get the job done at the same speed. The Malaysian Personnel arent at all proud of their work , they are slower and of course less efficent. That is one of the reasons y the RSAF can fare better then the RMAF.<br><br>Abt combat experience...hmm. I would say the Malaysian did a good job over at Somalia. They fought and came back alive ( with one casualty ), lets give them some credits for their action.<br><br>However , i will not see it as a damm heroic action. FIrstly the malaysian were stationed there at the point of time. They are simpily in the wrong place and at the wrong time. They cant reject UN's Mandate on the rescue , so , i will see it as a no choice situation. It is not that 10 countries were stationed there and malaysia volunteered herself to save the Rangers.<br><br>Anyway since the Soldiers had fought and came back with the minimum casualties , lets give them some credits......</div>

Can't be battery failure. Even A4s have backup systems in case of battery failure and I don't think aircraft use batteries in the air (should check with E &amp; I guys). Think they take electrical power straight from engine (I'm not sure). <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_question.gif" alt="Question" title="Question"><br>A4s are 50s era aircraft and still have Ram Air Turbines for emergency<br>electrical power. Don't tell me Migs don't have that? I believe that even with total electrical power failure with no backup. The pilot can still maneuver the plane by disable all the control surface actuators and use brute strength to control the planes, assuming not using hydraulic actuators. We do that all the time with our planes. If anybody know the answers, tell me why that can happen to a 70s plane.

Even A4s have backup systems in case of battery failure and I don't think aircraft use batteries in the air (should check with E &amp; I guys). Think they take electrical power straight from engine (I'm not sure). <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_question.gif" alt="Question" title="Question"><br>A4s are 50s era aircraft and still have Ram Air Turbines for emergency<br>electrical power. Don't tell me Migs don't have that? I believe that even with total electrical power failure with no backup. The pilot can still maneuver the plane by disable all the control surface actuators and use brute strength to control the planes, assuming not using hydraulic actuators. We do that all the time with our planes. If anybody know the answers, tell me why that can happen to a 70s plane. Thanks.<br><br>I'm just an airframe man but I do know some basic informations since I watch my other trade friends work as well.</div></blockquote>i didnt get from newws report.<br><br>i am 100% sure its battey failure<br><br>bottom line</div>
