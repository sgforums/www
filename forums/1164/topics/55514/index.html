"At this meeting, they did not make any final decision that will be lasting and durable."<br><br>The stakes in the dispute shot up last year after Murphy Oil made a sizeable discovery in a Malaysian block near the disputed area, and put preliminary estimates on the Kikeh field's recoverable reserves at 400 million to 700 million barrels.<br><br>Syed Hamid declined to say whether the halt on exploration activities in the area would continue.<br><br>Malaysia has proposed a production-sharing agreement, according to a source in Brunei with knowledge of the sultanate's policymaking.<br><br>But Brunei's U.K.-based advisers have warned such a pact may mean conceding Malaysia has territorial rights, the source said.<br><br>Brunei, a tiny nation of 330,000 people surrounded on all sides by Malaysia, lacks the muscle to back up its claim, however, and may lose more by digging in against its neighbour.<br><br>Syed Hamid said there were areas both sides could agree on.<br><br>"I think we have moved nearer to a final solution," he said, adding it was possible to resolve the issue before Mahathir steps down in October. Brunei's exclusive economic zone (EEZ) stretches 200 km (124 miles) offshore and the sultanate awarded exploration blocks.<br><br>But Malaysia bases its overlapping claim on possession of some tiny islands and reefs in the South China Sea, and argues that Brunei only has jurisdiction over its continental shelf, in water up to 200 m (656 ft) deep. About three-quarters of the EEZ is in deeper water<br><br>POOR BRUNEI... sure kena bully left right centre...... wat can singapore do for them?</div>

Each country's monetary bodies are still fully independent and can pursue wholly independent monetary and forex policies.<br>Singapore's currency is on a managed exchange rate where the MAS tries to maintain the SGD against a basket of foreign currencies within an undisclosed upper and lower limit. the limits and the composition of the basket of currency are state secrets for national security and economic stability reasons and for the very reason of guarding against speculative attacks. Further more more speculative attacks would only against currencies that are grossly over/undervalued.<br>Also for a sovereign democratic state such as malaysia to use it's state funds to fiddle in speculation would not only be political suicide for the incumbant government but also provide instablity within its own capital mkts and this point is especially important to a country where direct foreign invesment is so important.<br>My understanding of economics is only a spatula, others with more knowledge could give a better arguement but i dare say the scenario you painted is rather far-fetched<br><br>We must respect Brunei's sovereignty and its right to do as it sees fit. Perhaps the best thing singapore could do is to raise this matter subtly through diplomatic channels that singapore is willing to help or show support on this matter and perhaps the foreign ministers could share dossiers on malaysia's strategy in territorial disputes.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Here is an article from Alexander's Gas and Oil Magazine about the Brunei conflict.<br><br><strong>Brunei and Malaysia continue to discuss oil sharing formula</strong><br>02-06-03 Malaysia has offered an oil sharing formula to Brunei to resolve the drilling dispute in the Sultanate's offshore waters, reliable sources said. It said Brunei was considering the matter. Both parties are inclined to come to an amicable settlement, sources added.<br><br>Leaders of both countries met to discuss the issue and some progress has been reportedly made. Meanwhile, the French operator Total has been forced to abort its planned exploration drilling off Brunei Darussalam at the 11th hour. The drilling was aborted following intervention from the Malaysian government, which disputes the sovereignty of the waters.<br><br>Total had been preparing to spud a wildcat well on its deep-water Block J production sharing contract and actually had its chosen rig on location <strong>when the Malaysian Navy turned up to put a stop to its operations. <span style="color: red;">There followed a few days' stand-off when the Bruneian Navy came to lend its support to the French.</span></strong> However, the Malaysian government apparently got the upper hand, and Totalelected to stop its planned drilling.<br><br>Total earlier had its site survey vessels driven away by the Malaysian Navy. A company insider earlier told that it <strong> would not have signed the PSC for Block J had it not been <span style="color: red;">assured by the sultanate that sovereignty was not in doubt.</span></strong> Partners in the Block J PSC are operator Total with 60 %, BHP Billiton 25 %, and Amerada Hess 15 %.<br><br><strong>The Malaysian authorities maintain that Block J and adjacent Block K, for which a Shell-led consortium is negotiating a PSC with Brunei, lie in its territorial waters. <span style="color: red;">A couple of months before the French company signed for Block J in March, Malaysia awarded two blocks -- designated L and M -- to Murphy</span>. These blocks off Sabah <span style="color: red;">virtually overlap </span>the Block J and K PSCs which, according to Brunei, are located in its exclusive economic zone. </strong><br><br>Source: Brudirect.com<br><br>You see how the same news from Brunei sources differ from ST account of the news<br><br><strong>Malaysia, Brunei fail to end offshore oil row </strong><br><br>From the ST<br>22 Aug 2003 11:26<br><br>KUALA LUMPUR, Aug 22 (Reuters) - Talks between Brunei and Malaysia failed on Friday to settle rival territorial claims on oil-rich waters off Borneo island, with Kuala Lumpur saying its proposal made in May was its best offer.<br><br>Malaysian Foreign Minister Syed Hamid Albar said after a meeting between Brunei's Sultan Hassanal Bolkiah and Malaysian Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad that it was now up to Brunei to consider the proposal.<br><br><strong>Exploration activities in the disputed area have been halted after the Malaysian navy earlier this year chased off a drilling team belonging to a consortium led by France's Total. </strong><br><br>blah blah blah<br><br><strong><span style="color: red;">Noticed how the ST forgot to mention anything about the Malaysian and Brunei navy having a standoff at sea for A FEW DAYS!</span></strong><br><br>This is why we should not trust the ST for any Malaysia reporting ... they are bound to leave out the facts as it suits them.

            <div class='col-md body'>Anyone knows if the Malaysian papers reported likewise as ST did?<br><br>While no apologist for ST, aside from not wanting to help escalate the tense situation thru' publicity, i also think it doesn't want to contribute to the strengthening of Malaysian's hand against the Bruneians. If the whole world knows about it, then the former would harden it's position. Just my 2 cents</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I can't trust both sides media to be reporting factually on this matter. The Malaysians will probably claim that their navy got chased off by the Bruneins.<br><br>What I don't understand is what the ST is trying to do? Start a fight between the Malaysians and the Bruneians? They are expert at stirring up shit. But its lots of fun to catch them at their game and expose them (when possible)</div>
