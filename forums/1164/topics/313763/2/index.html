              <p>Really, I'm only aware of FF or FFG, but not FFS.  I guess I'll ask a friend whose serving on board one of those ships. </p>
              <p>I hope I don't invite some flames for saying this.  But to reduce a ship's radar signature by a tenth is a pretty big deal already.  Most radars have a limited range it can see other ships, usually limited by the horizon.  If the Formidables appear as a fishing boat at a certain distance, it might not appear at all if it was further away. </p>
              <p>Most signals attenuate with distance.  I guess what i'm suggesting is, the further away the Formidable is from the radar, the smaller it looks due to lower signal to noise ratio.  Depending on how much clutter the radar is set to remove, the Formidable may return a small enough signature to be considered as "Clutter" on some systems.  A maritime patrol aircraft with a larger scan area, may not pick up the Formidables at longer ranges. </p>

              <p>I hope I don't invite some flames for saying this.  But to reduce a ship's radar signature by a tenth is a pretty big deal already.  Most radars have a limited range it can see other ships, usually limited by the horizon.  If the Formidables appear as a fishing boat at a certain distance, it might not appear at all if it was further away. </p>
              <p>Most signals attenuate with distance.  I guess what i'm suggesting is, the further away the Formidable is from the radar, the smaller it looks due to lower signal to noise ratio.  Depending on how much clutter the radar is set to remove, the Formidable may return a small enough signature to be considered as "Clutter" on some systems.  A maritime patrol aircraft with a larger scan area, may not pick up the Formidables at longer ranges. </p>

            <div class='col-md body'><p>I believe the concept of stealth for jets differs from ships.  F117 and B2 are called stealth bombers and they are supposedly invisible on radar.  In fact a Discovery Channel documentary once claimed that stealth bombers on training missions had this "thingie" attached to make them traceable by radar so the control tower knows where they are.  For ships however, I don't think stealth means invisible.  In fact, I recall RSN has mentioned before that the Formidable class frigate would appear like a small ship on radar.  Whole idea is for the enemy to think its just a sampan or small patrol ship when in reality its an arse-kicking Frigate.  I don't think RSN at anytime said that their Frigates were invisible to radar.</p></div>

              Stealth for ships means being smaller then it really is.
              Why is that so? Well for one, when the USN first tested out the concept of a stealth ship,The SeaShadow Project, they realised that it worked too well.
              The ship did not reflect any of the radar waves back.
              That however meant a problem because the ship was showing up as a blackhole on the radar return.
              
              Why you may ask?
              Well due to the nature of the sea, the radar waves actually reflect of the surface of the water and waves which in certain conditions could be up to 8m-12m high.All of which produces a pretty significant radar return.

              <p>500 tons? Not unless you believe the obviously Taiwan slanted written article on global security.</p>
              <p>Another imaginary figure it seems...</p>
              <p>Here's from a more realistic source</p>
              <blockquote>
              <p>At the time of their commissioning, the units of the <em>La Fayette</em> class were the state of the art in <a title="Stealth" href="/wiki/Stealth"><span style="color: #0066cc;">stealth</span></a> for warships. The shape of the hull and the superstructures is devised for the optimal reduction of the <a class="new" title="Radar signature (page does not exist)" href="/w/index.php?title=Radar_signature&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1"><span style="color: #0066cc;">radar signature</span></a>, which has been reduced by 60%: a 3000-tonne <em>La Fayette</em> unit has the typical radar signature of a <strong><span style="color: #ff0000;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">1200 tonne ship. <br></span></span></strong></p>
              </blockquote>
              <p><strong><span style="color: #ff0000;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">BTW, even if it is 500 tons, it'll still be as visible to enemy radars as our 500 ton Fearless Class PVs.</span></span></strong></p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;"><span style="color: #000000;">And of course, to have stealth means that you have to becoming totally passive, turning off your radars and anything that generates EM radiation, which also means reducing your own combat-effectiveness to passive listening.</span></span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;"><span style="color: #000000;">This is not to say the low-observability features of the Formidable has no uses, but in pratice it's not as wonderous as it's cranked out to be, you'll have to sacrifice a lot of things to get the advantages of staying hidden longer.</span></span></p>

              <p>Our "stealth" is nothing special. It's more of pseudo-stealth actually, which is simply a first-generation redesigning of traditional ship shapes to make them more sensible in terms of RCS. But tactically it is better classified as low-observable then true stealth- as in the utility of stealth is a feature, and not the main defining feature that will affect the tactics of how you'll use the ship ie. true, STEALTH.</p>
              <p>The effort to manage naval signature has long been in progress.</p>
              <blockquote>
              <p>Reduction of radar cross section, visibility and noise is not unique to stealth ships, with visual masking employed for over two centuries and RCS reduction tracing back to American and Soviet ships of the <a title="Cold War" href="/wiki/Cold_War"><span style="color: #0066cc;">Cold War</span></a>. One common feature is the inward-sloping <a title="Tumblehome" href="/wiki/Tumblehome"><span style="color: #0066cc;">tumblehome</span></a> hull design that significantly reduces the radar cross-section.</p>

              <p><br>Yes correct, what I am pointing out is there's no need to go all lionnoisy over the "stealth" of our frigates, and they certainly ain't no Zumwalt... now that'll be something to boast about.</p>

              <p>its hard to imagine that a ship built in the 2000s could not come with a better "stealth" feature compare to one that was built decades earlier... its sad to see technology stagnant.</p>

              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">To reduce RCS is definitely a welcome for any combat vessels, but according to radar equation, the RCS has to be greatly reduced in order to achieve any significant detect range reduction:</span></p>

              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="font-size: 12.5pt; color: black; font-family: Arial; " lang="EN">To speak with some data, that is, if the detect range need to be reduced by half ( 1/2th) by means of RCS reduction solely, then the RCS has to be reduced to 1/256<sup>th</sup> of the original! A reduction of RCS to 1/10<sup>th</sup> of the original will only reduce the detection range of some 13% roughly. Usually a modern fighter can detect a DDG size target up to 300-400kms, reduction of 13% of such a range is really not a big deal. Your AshCM nowadays is still usually up to 200kms.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="font-size: 12.5pt; color: black; font-family: Arial; " lang="EN"> </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="font-size: 12.5pt; color: black; font-family: Arial; " lang="EN">On the other hand, RCS of a certain target is always NOT a constant! You paint it with S-band radar commonly found in AWACS and you paint it with X-band FCR in a fighter’s c-ockpit will result in totally different RCS of the target. Furthermore, the geometric features in different part of the vessel will result in different RCS as well, which means, if the radar sees the vessel in front at a low angel as a extremely bad case, it will find the vessel a “fishing boat” which may be just 1/10<sup>th</sup> of the thousands ton vessel, but how about seeing it from the side a thigh altitude? It may no longer be as “that small” any more. </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="font-size: 12.5pt; color: black; font-family: Arial; " lang="EN"> </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">Modern Naval combat vessels are equipped with state of art EW sensors. In a combat situation, hardly you can image a modern FFG not on its powerful search radar or in some case, highly identical fire control radar. Those radiations can be picked up far far away by passive sensors of the enemy fighter jets. How many "fishing boat" can shoot up thousand kws of radiation into sky? these are broadcasting your location as well. So what Stealth are people talking about FFS?</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;"> </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">Again, reduce RCS is definitely a good thing, but nobody will live on that because today’s modern radar and sensor technology is so well developed. </span></p>

              <p><br>There is such a thing called common sense and normal physics.</p>
              <p>Barring any kind of top secret technology that is light years ahead of our current understanding of stealth, there is no way our Formidable will have vastly improved strealth over the Lafayette barring major changes in it's hull geometry and what have you not. It's just simple physics, and at the end of the day seems to me like wishful thinking.</p>
              <p>It's like assuming that our F-15SG will have an vastly improved RCS over the F-15Cs that the USAF uses.</p>
              <p>Ultimately the fact remains that despite the "stealth" label thrown around in the media these days, the media remains undecerning about being clear on what is "signature-managed" and what is truly stealth. Our FFS falls better under being called "signature-managed", as in it's "stealth" is more of something to help it reduce its vulnerability then actually be used in an offensive manner. </p>
