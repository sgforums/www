            <div class='col-md body'><strong>EDITORIAL: Piloting the Pilatus<br><br>Dec 18:</strong>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br><br>THE fatal crash on Wednesday involving a Royal Malaysian Air Force Pilatus PC-7 made it the second time this year that the Swiss-made turboprop aircraft used to train pilots has fallen from the sky. It also brings the number of RMAF crashes this year to five Â— two Pilatus PC-7s, two Nuri helicopters, and one MiG-29 fighter jet.<br>While it is true that by any statistical measure, flying is generally safer than driving, and that more Malaysians die on the roads than in the air, safety in flying military and civilian airplanes is just as important as in driving private cars and commercial vehicles. The instructor and the trainee pilot, and the other aviators, would not have died in vain if their deaths draw attention to the safety issues involved.<br><br>Of course, until the board of inquiry finishes its investigation, the causes of the latest crash will not be known. The female trainee pilot who was killed in last year's Pilatus crash apparently suffered a blackout. The MiG-29 fighter pilot ejected to safety when he sensed the jet was experiencing technical problems. Strong headwinds were blamed for the Nuri helicopter crash in Ba'Kelalan, Sarawak, in August. In fact, a recent study by the RMAF showed that accidents involving Nuri helicopters were not due to technical factors.<br><br>While operational conditions and pilot error rather than engine failure seem to be the major causes of fatal air crashes, whether it be small planes or wide-bodied jets, there are nevertheless compelling reasons for replacing older models with newer ones. After all, the Bulldog replaced the Piston Provost in the 1970s, which in turn gave way to the Pilatus PC-7 in the early 80s. As the RMAF chief explained in the middle of this year, "Normally, when we buy an aircraft, we plan its deployment for 25 years. Upon reaching 10 to 15 years, we refurbish and upgrade it and after using it for 20 to 25 years, we propose to replace the plane with the latest in the market." But this has not happened in the case of the Nuri helicopters which were supposed to have been phased out by 1997, but will not now start until the Ninth Malaysia Plan at the earliest. While it is said that the Nuri helicopters will still be technically airworthy for the next 10 years, the sooner the ageing helicopters are replaced the better. Based on this time-frame for obsolescence, perhaps it is time to take a look at the Pilatus PC-7 as well. Not that the RMAF has failed to do so, because there are eight PC-7 MkIIs, the most recent trainer aircraft produced by Pilatus, at the Kepala Batas base.<br><br>Since about 20 air forces are training their pilots in the PC-7, it may be a good thing for the RMAF to compare not only its safety record with theirs but also to compare notes about how the PC-7s are flown and maintained and how the pilots are trained. There is a need for stiffer safety requirements and higher training standards. Everything possible must be done to make sure the skies are safe.<br><br><strong>Extracted from the New Straits Times.</strong><br><br></div>
