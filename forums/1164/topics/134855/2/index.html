Quite impossible to have more than 2 LHD/LPD in more opinion. Personally, the area I see RSN need to address are:<br><br>1.  by 2010, the replacement subs, probably 4 to 6 new Vikings or U212.<br><br>2. by 2012, the replacement of PVs with a fleet of stealth OPVs.<br><br>3. by 2015, the replacement of MCVs with some stealth covettes that can act as motherships to USVs.<br><br>4. by 2018, 2 LPD/LHDs that can carry approx 4-8 F-35Cs, 12 Helos of a mix of Chinnoks, Super Pumas, Seahawks and Apaches.</div>

At present rate of production, by the end of the decade, they can match the Japanese in several aspects, if not all, of naval warfare, especially anti-ship capabilities. Ultimately, it may boils down to training and logistics, as well as tactics, which I believe the Japanese would still hold the edge for quite a while.<br><br>See Http://www.sinodefense.com for more information.<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by 84mmrr:</div><div class="quote_body">Actually, Japan navy is the most powerful in Asia.

Pendant No 168, 170 (destroyer size), 525 and 526 (smaller ships - frigate size).<br><br>170 - Equipped with Aegis lookalike Phase Array Radar, Band Stand SSM FCR, Project 956E's SAM FCR lookalike, 8 batteries X 6 cells VLS version of PL-10, 8 X SSM in tubular launcher (Possibly a imp version of C-802) 4 X 2 launchers, 2 X Goalkeeper CIWS (One in front, one at the aft) and one 100mm gun (French Creusot-Loire lookalike). Ka-28 Helo with hanger. CODOG<br><br>168 - Top-Plate 3D radar, FCR for SSM and SAM looks the same, 2 X single  SA-N-7 launcher, 2 X Goalkeeper CIWS (One on each side). 4 X 4 SSM boxed launchers (looks like C-802, found onboard Luhai class), 2 X RBU rockets, Ka-28 with hanger.<br><br>525, 526 - French origin Surveillance radar (looks like sea tiger). Crotale SAM with associated FCR. 2 X 4 boxed launcher believe to be C-802.  100mm gun and Ka-28 with helo hangers. 2 X RBU-rockets, 4 X AK-630 type CIWS. (two on both side, above helo hanger and below the funnel) Looks like conventional propulsion. (Diesel engine)<br><br>Btw, JMSDF have been running around with Shirane and Haruna for several years. Haruna commissioned in Feb 1973, Shirane in Mar 1980.</div>

Haruna and Shirane are old destroyers which I had mentioned in previous posting.  Oshimi and Shimokita, according to JMSDF, is a LST (LST? doesn't fit the designation).  but in fact if you look at it close eoungh.  It looks like a uncompleted assault carrier or LPH.  What you need to put in is a ski ramp, just lke the invincible.  By then, you can operate VTOL/STOL aircraft, which is easily available to them. AV-8 series. or V-22.  They can also carry what they have now. Namely Seaknight, Chinook, Cobra, Apache and seahawk.  Effectively a assault amphibious carrier.  How about that.  It is time for China to sell more goods to the world to get enough money to get herself a carrier to strike a balance in the region.</div>
