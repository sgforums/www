Most officers start pen-pushing after OC tour (unless they sway enough not to go thru that) but they may be cycled back to become Bn CO and so on if they are deemed to have command potential. Kinda sad life if you ask me, riding a desk instead of your rifle. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I can offer some personal input; my brother just made LTC recently, at age 37. He was a NSF commissioned officer, but didn't sign on until after he ORD'd &amp; have completed his NTU degree course. It was interesting tracking his career; he wasn't a shooting star by any means, but got promoted at roughly the "right" stages. There's a underlying professional momentum affecting all regulars, &amp; the status perception is being "condemned" if they don't attain a certain rank by a certain age (esp. prior to getting the 1st crab.)<br><br>Finished OCS - 2LT<br>Before ORD - LTA<br>Mid-20s - CPT, usually with a command stint at the company level or equivalent<br>29/30/31 years old - MAJ<br><br>Up to this rank, the promotions road is generally consistent &amp; predictable; a regular officer would also tend to finish his 1st bond commitment by the end of this period. Thereafter, there's more of a "politics" element that come into play, since there's only so much available appointments for MAJ or higher, &amp; a candidate would have to compete with the scholars who're on the fast track. It also takes place more in the staff-officer (not combat-) arena, so your track record of requisite training courses is also a big factor. My brother also used the opportunity around this stage to finish a Master's degree in Public Policy.<br><br>As for Lee Hsien Loong - &amp; also the other Big 4 military scholars/politicians (George Yeo, Teo Chee Hean, Lim Hng Kiang, Lim Swee Say) - I think their rapid SAF achievements have more to do with the fact that Singapore was trying to create a professional officer corps as quickly as possible from the early 70's onwards. It's a credit to them that they didn't fail the test.<br><br>Prior to that, the pioneer officers were either remnants of the SVC &amp; SMF - 1SIR/2SIR (&amp; national service in general) were initiated with self-government in the late 50's, rather than independence in '65 - or commissioned with the new SAFTI-trained batch. The military in the early days was also PAP-controlled; flip through the pages of the <span style="font-style: italic;">Singapore Artillery 100th Anniversary</span> book &amp; you'll see Goh Keng Swee reviewing troops - in military dress as a "Honorary Colonel"!<br><br>Thus, there's fast track for today's SAF scholars, &amp; there's a more-urgent fast track for their predecessors 2 decades ago. Here's a link of that era's progressive batch: LHL was the launcher of the program in '71; the other quartet were chosen 2 years later (though it was TCH, being career naval officer, ended up as the least politically experienced today).<br><br>http://www.scholar.mindef.gov.sg/ourscholars_succ_intro.asp<br><br>Even as all senior officers should complete a CO stint with a combat unit at some point, those who are scholars aren't always required to do this "linear-ly". In other words, they may be posted to attend staff-officer courses (local &amp; overseas) earlier in their careers; the implication being MINDEF or the SAF taking a long-term view of grooming. That's partly why the non-scholar officers sometimes feel 2nd-class &amp; shortchanged, after being bypassed for promotion or reposting in favor of the high-fliers. So much for meritocracy ~lol~</div>
