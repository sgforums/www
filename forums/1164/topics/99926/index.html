            <div class='col-md body'>The possibility of heavy-handededness exists in every army; the Thais are sometimes accused of extra-judicial killings &amp; citizen disappearances as well, though not high-profile or extensive as the Indonesians.<br><br>No need to suspect them. The Thais are very skillful in maintaining political neutrality as well, having fending off European colonialism as well as, in the 20th century, the Jap aggression &amp; the neighborly Vietnam War.<br><br>Do I respect their common soldier? Yes. (They serve 2-year NS as well, plus possible reservist until age 55.) Their command &amp; control? Less so. It's a big country, &amp; like the rest of the SE Asian armed forces, the armies are delegated more for internal security &amp; counterinsurgency ops. Also, from a certain level of higher staff command onwards, there's a lot of political ambitions mixed in with regular-army duties. Nothing like the regional warlordism associated with early-20th C China, of course, or the military cliques of Myanmar. But I think the opportunity's there for Thai generals to establish power bases.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Thai people can be very murderous. Remember all the frequent incidents of Thai workers in Singapore stabbing dead other Thai workers?<br><br>Thais are cruel, ruthless and cold-blooded killers which seems to be a trait of people from that region including Cambodians, Burmese, Laotians and Vietnamese.<br><br>So their soldiers have very strong killer instincts along with good jungle fighting capabilities. And the Thais are very proud of the fact that they have never been invaded, occupied or colonised by a foreign power.<br><br>However, Thailand has a funny record in WW2.<br><br>Being no friend of western colonial powers like Britain or France during WW2, Thailand launched a full-scale attack with army and air force on French-occupied Indochina (Cambodia or Vietnam). The French were in no shape to fight and sued for peace. The Japanese (pre-Pearl Harbour) stepped in as negotiators.<br><br>In the end, the Thais withdrew and got very little for their troubles but the Japs managed to secure airbases in Vietnam. Don't ask me how, I just read this in a book.<br><br>It is from these airbases that japanese planes flew to attack the Prince of Wales and Repulse. These airbases later supported the Malayan campaign.<br><br>The Thais didn't stop there. They let the Japs land troops on Thai soil so they could launch an overland attack on Malaysia besides the seaborne assault.<br><br>Even though in Thai opinion the Brits are just another foreign aggressor no different from the Japs, their roles led to the sufferings of millions of Singaporeans, Malaysians and Allied troops under the Jap occupation.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>The RTA is generally good at battalion-level operations, but their capability to operate under mid-intensity conditions is suspect. The '87-89 clashes (Battle of Ban Rhomklao) along the Thai-Laotian border, exposed the weaknesses/deficiencies in RTA operations. Its even probable that the RTA has not conducted exercises above battalion-level, or even so, at a very minimal level.<br><br>Fighting a conventional war today under high-tech conditions, the largely peasent-based RTA (esp. amongst the lower echelons) would be presented with difficulties of operational capability, training and maintenance of high-tech weaponry.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"></div>
