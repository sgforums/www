            <div class='col-md body'>I dont see how china is a threat to us... They look up to us Singaporeans alot. And I look up to them too because you have to admit they are really a great nation. How so? Ever since New China opened up in 1978, they have jumped many times in economical strength, their 5 year plans did work for the 3 main cities and it is really scary to see the rate of progress there. The real advantage we have now over them is really our language proficiency. As they start to pick up english, and they are at this very moment... oh dear for Singaporeans. Singapore as we all know has no resources but people, and people is something China doesnt lack.<br><br>Okay maybe i said too much but my point is, we really do not gain if we go against China. In fact we have alot to lose. I'd rather work with them than against them which is practically what all the MNCs are doing...<br><br>Idealogies aside, (actually they are not much different from Singapore) we are actually similar because of the basis of social responsibility and Asian Values just like China. They are no longer the typical stereotyped communists we all have in our heads. In fact, sometimes I can't help but feel we are even more conservative and 'closed up'. I may sound pro-china to you but really im just stating what i have seen and understood from my counterparts in china and simple studies i've done.<br><br>Anyway Japan CANNOT go nuclear. I don't think China will allow it. China has slammed NK for the nukes. It will cause massive political and military instability in the region if any other posseses nuclear arms.<br><br>Its interesting to note some of you guys view china's action as a failure. While i do not agree with you, i certainly do not say that you are wrong either. IMO, China has done pretty much the right thing. They got NK back to the talks. made them abandon their nuke programme. What's more? certainly for the moment this is sufficient. Japan's overreaction to the issue demanding Chapter 7 of the UN charter to be enforced was really extreme. I bet the Defcon then was like 2 or something... Imagine if they actually went through with it... SK will be wiped by 70,000 artillery pieces just because they get pissed off by the jap's suggestion and/or action.<br><br></div>

[/b]</blockquote>I saw a Xinhua News Agency approved newsclip of recent meeting between ASEAN leaders and Chinese leaders. The newsclip took pains to feature the every handshake between each leader of an ASEAN country and the Chinese leader. This is a sign of respect, making sure no one is left out. They showed 2 different handshake occasions, and the order is different both times so that no favouritism is shown to any particular country.<br><br>From the grovelling way ALL the ASEAN leaders are smiling as they greeted the Chinese leader, future conflicts with China is probably the last thing on their minds. They all see a big cake and are all wondering when the Chinese will throw us some crumbs.<br><br>I was actually quite shocked at this formal protocol of ASEAN leaders walking up one by one to shake the Chinese leader's hand, as opposed to the Chinese leader - being the host - walking up and shaking each ASEAN leader's hand.<br><br>It gave the feeling of lesser chiefs paying tribute to the big chief.<br><br><blockquote>Originally posted by storm_freaky13:<br>Idealogies aside, (actually they are not much different from Singapore) we are actually similar because of the basis of social responsibility and Asian Values just like China.

All Chinese look slightly offended if you use the word "gong c(h)an" - communist - when you describe them or their country. In fact, this is a word best not used in social occasions. Most will privately tell you that the only thing communist about China is the Communist Party itself. Everyone else is just Chinese - Zhong Guo Ren - as defined by race and nationality - not politics.<br><br><blockquote>Originally posted by storm_freaky13:<br>Anyway Japan CANNOT go nuclear. I don't think China will allow it. China has slammed NK for the nukes.

The Americans have always supported countries or individuals with dubious agendas who later become a terror.<br><br><blockquote>Originally posted by storm_freaky13:<br>Its interesting to note some of you guys view china's action as a failure.

China is no saint, nor is it a complete success as a nation. It had never been in history nor will it ever become a "perfect" nation. But historically, China had never been actively adventurous beyond its natural borders.<br><br>This is not to say they won't be.<br><br>But I can't see why a country with more than enough land, people and resources would risk war with ASEAN to... what ends?<br><br>Oil?<br><br>It is a hell lot cheaper in the long run - economically and politically - for them to buy the oil than to send a task force to invade, and then occupy a sovreign nation for its oil.<br><br>This is what Japan found out in WW2 that foreign land and oil eventually cost them their country and millions of lives. But that's because Japan at that time was run by short-sighted military men who knew shxt about economy.</div>
