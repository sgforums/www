            <div class='col-md body'>Now SAUDI ARABIA follow suit for GROUNDING<br>-------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br><br>DATE:13/11/07<br>SOURCE:Flight International<br><strong>F-15 operators follow USAF grounding after crash </strong><br>By Graham Warwick<br><br>Over 1,100 aircraft out of action as Israel, Japan and <strong>Saudi Arabia follow suit</strong><br><br>US Air Force pleas for funds to replace its ageing aircraft took on a new edge with the indefinite grounding of its fleet of almost 700 Boeing F-15s following a 2 November crash suspected to have been caused by structural failure.<br><br>F-15 operators Israel (95 aircraft), Japan (160) and Saudi Arabia (145) followed suit after the USAF suspended all non-essential flights. US F-15E strike fighters based in Iraq and Afghanistan and F-15C interceptors assigned to North American air defence remain on ground alert to fly if required, although their missions have been taken over by other US and allied aircraft. Boeing confirms that it is "providing engineering support" to the USAF during its investigation.<br><br>The Missouri Air National Guard F-15C, built in 1980, was engaged in air-combat training with three other F-15s when it crashed. The pilot ejected, sustaining minor injuries. Reports that the aircraft separated aft of the cockpit have not been not confirmed by the USAF, but the aircraft's forward fuselage is not discernable in video of wreckage site.<br><br>In April 2002, an F-15C crashed into the Gulf of Mexico after the leading edge of its left vertical stabiliser broke off during a high-speed dive to Mach 1.97. The F-15's leading edge and upper aft portion of the vertical stabilisers are being replaced during depot maintenance, and the USAF says it has completed 463 of its 664 aircraft - including the one involved in the Missouri accident, which was repaired in August 2003.<br><br>The air force plans to keep the F-15C in service until 2025 and its newer F-15Es until 2035, and recently awarded contracts to upgrade up to 179 Cs and all 224 Es with Raytheon's APG-63(V)4 active electronically scanned array radars.<br><br>Lockheed Martin's F-22 was designed to replace the F-15, but production is planned to end in 2011 after providing just 183 of the 381 aircraft the USAF says it needs. The service has requested Department of Defense approval to buy a further 20 F-22As, which would extend production by a year, but require more than $4.4 billion in additional funding.<br><br><a href="http://www.flightglobal.com/articles/2007/11/13/219288/f-15-operators-follow-usaf-grounding-after-crash.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.flightglobal.com/articles/2007/11/13/219288/f-15-operators-follow-usaf-grounding-after-crash.html</a></div>

All F-15s had been grounded since the US Air National Guard F-15C crash in Missouri on 2 November caused by suspected structural failure.<br><br>The USAF is allowing wings operating the more than 200 newer E-model F-15s to return their aircraft to flying status after completing a so-called "time compliance technical order" (TCTO) inspection. The targeted inspections are a result of preliminary data from the crash site, says the USAF.<br><br><img src="http://www.flightglobal.com/assets/getAsset.aspx?ItemID=20363"><br><br>Before returning to flight, the F-15Es must undergo visual and non-destructive inspection of the hydraulic lines, fuselage longerons, and straps and skin panels around the environmental control system bays, the USAF.<br><br>The USAF says the TCTO inspection was developed as the result of an engineering analysis conducted after the 2 November crash. An analysis is under way for the older F-15A-Ds, and will result in a similar inspection, says the USAF, but details have yet to be defined.<br><br>The F-15A-Ds are expected to remain grounded until after the accident investigation board submits its report, which is due within 30 days of the crash, says the USAF.<br><br>The investigation is focusing on the area aft of the cockpit, where the accident F-15 is reported to have separated in flight during one-versus-one air combat training.<br><br><img src="http://www.flightglobal.com/assets/getAsset.aspx?ItemID=20370"><br><br>F-15E cutaway drawing from Flight's archive           Â© Flight<br><br>Israel and Saudi Arabia are expected to follow suit and lift the grounding of their versions of the F-15E, the F-15I and F-15S respectively. Boeing will also be able to resume deliveries of new F-15Ks to South Korea.<br><br>Six US senators, meanwhile, have demanded that the US Department of Defense make public the results of three studies that are said to conclude the 183 Lockheed Martin F-22A Raptors planned for the US Air Force are not sufficient.<br><br>The USAF is seeking additional funding to buy more F-22s to replace its ageing F-15s.</div>

The Russians, the Chinese and the Indians have better planes than our F-15s". (Ex with Indian Air Force SU30MKI)<br>The USAF is now trying the "OMG! Our F-15s are dropping out of the sky".<br>They sure are using whatever means to get the budget for more Raptors.<br>Next, we may start seeing USAF F-15s falling apart while on ground.<br><br>If the Israelis could fly their F-15 and land it with just 1 wing and it didn't broke up in mid-flight with such structural damage, I just can't imagine how it could have just broken up in mid-flight if the aircraft was properly serviced and maintained.<br>Structural failures don't just appear suddenly. </div></blockquote>From what I understand from some of the Eagle drivers, there has been a history of "lack of maintenance" esp with regards to the Alpha and Bravo series of the F-15s flown by the ANGs.  A lot of that was attributed to the collapse of the Soviet Union, where the enemy they've been training to fight all this while, just dropped dead.  Funding was directed away into other more "humanitarians" needs and I guess, that repercussion is felt through the USAF til today.<br><br>In a way, I'd sympathize the USAF for being the hardest hit.  The Navy still got their F/A-18E/Fs, but had to end up scrapping their entire Tomcat fleet for it.  The USAF scrapped their Ravens and haven't got a dedicated jammer since. That few years of funding decrease hurt them.<br><br></div>

The Es are not that  old and probably not due for anything major yet ( 1st delivery in 1988 ).<br><br>Unfortunately, USAF was shortchanged and currently had only &lt;200 Raptors approved. Now that an opportunity (though an unfortunate one) is presented to ask for more Raptors, don't you think the big guns won't milk this to the fullest. Ever wonder why the Es can be quickly put back on the flightline? The longer the A/B/C/Ds are grounded, the stronger the case for more Raptors. Its the other operators (Japan, Israel, Saudi) who had to downgrade their air defences, while the Pentagon plays politics.</div>
