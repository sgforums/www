MHI is likely to upgrade 32 of the air force's 200 F-15s in the first project phase.<br><br><img src="http://www.flightglobal.com/assets/getAsset.aspx?ItemID=20488"><br><br>The programme has an added urgency as Tokyo is delaying plans to procure a new batch of fighters to replace its ageing McDonnell Douglas F-4s. It has asked for information on the Lockheed Martin F-22 Raptor and F-35 Joint Strike Fighter, Boeing F-15 and F/A-18E/F Super Hornet, Dassault Rafale, and the Eurofighter Typhoon. However, the USA is refusing to release information on the stealthy F-22, the aircraft that Japan covets the most, forcing the programme into limbo.<br><br>The stand-off has resulted in Japan starting a study to develop next-generation stealth technology, which if successful could lead to the production of its first indigenous fighter in almost 30 years and give it a long-desired ability to counter China's growing air power. Observers believe the study could also be an attempt to force the USA to release information on the F-22, especially since an indigenous programme would cost several times more than an outright purchase.<br><br>Upgrades to Japan's F-15s and possibly even some of its F-4s could be given priority in the coming years, although the latter have not been included in the fiscal year 2008 budget.<br><br>Boeing has been talking to overseas operators of the F-15 about radar upgrades, after receiving a $70 million contract to retrofit US Air Force and Air National Guard F-15Cs with Raytheon's APG-63(V)3 active electronically scanned array radar.<br><br>The USA is also looking to upgrade its F-15Es with AESA radars, with the APG-63(V)4 competing against a derivative of Northrop Grumman's APG-81 developed for the JSF. Such systems would give the F-15 enhanced capabilities such as those sought by Japan to counter possible threats from China and North Korea.<br><br></div>

Thomas Crosson said in an interview.<br><br>The latest problem is with cracks in the planes' metal support beams, called longerons, that run the length of the aircraft, and make up the sill on which the canopy sits, Crosson told Military.com.<br><br>The entire F-15 fleet was ordered grounded in early November after the break up and crash of a Missouri Air National Guard Eagle. The Air Force began lifting the restrictions on the fleet Nov. 19 - starting with F-15E Strike Eagles - following aggressive inspections of the planes.<br><br>ACC called for the new groundings after metallurgical analysis of the planes suggested there could be possible cracking problems with the longerons.<br><br>Officials now are working at Warner Robins Air Force Base, Ga., to develop an inspection list that will be sent out to F-15 maintainers across the Air Force.<br><br>Crosson said the list should be completed in a day or two, and will include a timeframe for how long the actual inspections should take.<br><br>He could not say how long it would before the latest restrictions would be lifted from the entire fleet.<br><br>-- Christian<br><br><a href="http://www.defensetech.org/" rel="nofollow">http://www.defensetech.org/</a></div>
