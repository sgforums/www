            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by Shotgun:</div><div class="quote_body">Oh come on. France few interests down in SEA today.  If you still want to consider France a "threat" to SEA, go ahead.<br><br>With the majority of the military clashes involving China, sinking of vietnamese gunboats, I don't see how any ASEAN nation not consider this to be a security matter of great importance.<br><br>I'm not saying that China is hell bent on projecting its military prowess to cower us into submission.  In fact, I feel that China has gone quite the opposite in positive diplomatic engagements with ASEAN.  However, with its last shot in anger fired less than 2 decades ago, its wise to remain vigilant.<br><br></div></blockquote> The first sentence is just an extrapolation of your initial reasoning for the question "are they (China) a threat to South East Asia?" France still have significant interest in Asia, though more in China than even the ASEAN combined. There is no reason to consider them a threat for what they did in Vietnam in the past. The same way there is no reason to consider China a threat to any SEA countries based on what China did in Vietnam.<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by Shotgun:</div><div class="quote_body">Oh please, I've never suggested a military confrontation with China either. Stop putting words in my "posts."<br><br>Fact of the matter is, China is a security challenge, it is also an economic challenge for ASEAN. There's need for both deterrence and cooperation in facing the security challenges it poses, and to prevent Chinese Dominance in our region.<br><br>ASEAN has to constantly to engage US, Japan and even Europe to counter the effect of the China's rise, and prevent the hegemony of any one power. </div></blockquote> The power in play in the region also include India and Russia, besides China, US/Australia, Japan and the EU. It is to the interest of Singapore to stay engaged to all these power without taking side. We don't see all SEA countries having a common or solidarity stand on this.<br><br>A paper published by somebody in the S Rajaratnam School of International Studies, 6 June 2007 stated that the spratlys dispute has actually de-escalated in recent years, it is no longer perceived as a security flashpoint capable of undermining order in the region. The territorial dispute has been shelved to some extent and the parties involved have de escalated what remain inherently a security issue. It is important we recognise the change of events and move on.<br><br>If any country is identified and recognised as a threat to us, unless we do not take it seriously, we would need to be prepared for such threat. and if the other party responds to our preparation, this would easily lead to a military confrontation, no?<br><br>In security cooperation, Singapore works closely with many nations, besides some of the powers in play in the region. We have avoided any form of military cooperation with China, due to sensitivity in the american and european hardware we are using. It is also for similar reason, SAF is never welcome to train even within ASEAN, and we have to send our troops all the way to South Africa for training. Such is the trust and cooperation WITHIN ASEAN. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br><br>In short, anybody can view China a threat for all you want, but do not expect the SAF to prepare to use our F15 for strike into territories far away from Singapore, such as the Spratlys, to defend SEA. On the other hand, we all know that we need to be prepared for potential threats which are real, terrorists who are trained in neigboring countries, foreign leader who want to skin us like cat, countries who would just re draw their map to include Singapore as part of their territory.......<br><br>F15S must be equipped to fly deep in to take out known terrorists training camps wherever that may be when necessary,........</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Good point noted.  Every member of ASEAN has their own views and policies towards China.<br><br>China's military buildup is a security concern to ASEAN.  That is an acknowledge fact.  The US's report on China's military also notes that.   They have newer and quieter diesel submarines capable of patrols out to the Spratly's, and have also conducted air-refueling exercises over the South China Sea with their Su-27 Flankers.<br><br>While tensions around the disputed isles have indeed de-escalated, it does not change the fact that they did open fire on foreign vessels around the disputed Isles.<br><br>Again, I'm not saying that we send our Strike Eagles out to the Spratlys.
