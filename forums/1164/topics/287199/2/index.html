John Elolf, a spokesman for the U.S. Air Force Central Command.<br><br>Maj. Cristin Marposon, an Air Force spokeswoman, told The Associated Press the country's fleet of 676 F-15s, including mission critical jets, was grounded on November 3 for "airworthiness concerns" after the crash of an older model F-15C on Friday.<br><br>The cause of the crash is still under investigation, but Air Force officials said it was a structural failure and the plane broke apart in flight.<br><br>A spokeswoman for Boeing, the aircraft's manufacturer, told AP the company was cooperating with the Air Force but could not provide additional comment because of the pending investigation.<br><br>Col. Robert Leeker, commander of the 131st Fighter Wing, said Friday the plane had been among four planes split into pairs and were engaging in one-on-one training flights in which speeds of 400 to 450 mph are typical, according to AP.<br><br>A pilot, a 10-year veteran of the guard whose name and rank were not released, safely ejected from the aircraft when it crashed in Dent County, Missouri, AP reported. The pilot suffered a dislocated shoulder, a broken arm and minor cuts and bruises.<br><br>Now only "mission critical" F-15s will fly.<br><br>Pentagon officials said the U.S. Navy has had to move the only aircraft carrier in the region from the Persian Gulf to the North Arabian Sea to fill mission gaps for the F-15s.<br><br>Several dozen F/A-18 fighters from the aircraft carrier USS Enterprise will fly missions with other Air Force aircraft to fill mission gaps.<br><br>The F-15E Strike Eagle is an air-to-ground and air-to-air fighter, making it more versatile than other F-15 models, which are used for only air-to-air missions.<br><br>The Strike Eagle is used in Afghanistan in its air to ground role, dropping bombs on targets with its advanced sensors.<br><br>"The U.S. Air Force maintains assigned F-15E Strike Eagles on ground alert and will accomplish all assigned missions with a variety of fighter, attack and bomber aircraft, and unmanned aerial vehicles, under my command and control during this period," Lt. Gen. Gary L. North, commander of the U.S. Central Command's Combined Forces Air Component, said in a statement Monday.<br><br>The single-seat F-15C is one of the older models in the Air Force's fleet of 700 F-15s which entered service in 1979.<br><br>The Air Force's top aircraft, the stealthy F-22 Raptor, is newly operational for the air service and has not yet been deployed in combat.<br><br>The expensive F-22 will eventually be the main fighter jet for the Air Force, but budgetary restrictions on the plane have forced the Air Force to cut the number of planes it will have in the fleet.</div>

While the Eagle's aerodynamics and maneuverability are still on a par with newer aircraft, quantum leaps in integrated circuit technology have made the original F-15 avionics suite obsolete. The objective of the Multi-Stage Improvement Program (MSIP) was to set the Eagle in step with today's vastly improved information processing systems. Some F-15C/D aircraft (tail numbers 84-001 and higher) came off the assembly line with MSIP in place. All F-15A/B/C/D aircraft produced before 84-001 will receive the MSIP retrofit at the F-15 depot. Improvements incorporated via MSIP vary between F-15A/B and F-15C/D aircraft; the C/D MSIP has been completed. However, all air-to-air Eagles gain improved radar, central computer, weapons and fire control, and threat warning systems.<br><br>The purpose of the F-15 Multi-stage Improvement Program (MSIP) was to provide maximum air superiority in a dense hostile environment in the late 1990s and beyond. All total, 427 Eagles received the new avionics upgrades. Along with later model production aircraft, these retrofitted aircraft would provide the Combat Air Forces (CAF) with a total MSIP fleet of 526 aircraft. The MSIP upgraded the capabilities of the F-15 aircraft to included a MIL-STD-1760 aircraft/weapons standard electrical interface bus to provide the digital technology needed to support new and modern weapon systems like AMRAAM. The upgrade also incorporated a MIL-STD-1553 digital command/response time division data bus that would enable onboard systems to communicate and to work with each other. A new central computer with significantly improved processing speed and memory capacity upgraded the F-15 from 70s to 90s technology, adding capacity needed to support new radar and other systems. The original Eagle had less computer capacity than a 1990s car. Some of the work prefaced the addition of the Joint Tactical Information Distribution System, adding space, power, and cooling that would allow the new avionics to run in the harsh environments in which the Eagle operates. The new programmable armament control set (PACS) with a multi-purpose color display (MPCD) for expanded weapons control, monitoring, and release capabilities featured a modern touch screen that allowed the pilot to talk to his weapons. A data transfer module (DTM) set provided pre-programmed information that customized the jet to fly the route the pilot had planned using mission planning computers. An upgrade to the APG-63 Radar for multiple target detection, improved electronic counter-countermeasures (ECCM) characteristics, and non-cooperative target recognition capability enabled the pilot to identify and target enemy aircraft before he was detected or before the enemy could employ his weapons. An upgrade of the advanced medium range air-to-air missile (AMRAAM), that carried up to eight missiles, represented an improvement that complimented the combat-proven AIM-7 Sparrow by giving the pilot capability to engage multiple targets to launch and leave, targeting and destroying enemy fighters before they could pose a threat. The upgraded Radar Warning Receiver (RWR) and an enhanced internal countermeasures set (ICS) on F-15C/D models improved threat detection and self-protection radar jamming capability that allowed pilots to react to threat and to maneuver to break the lock of enemy missiles. FÂ–15 combat capabilities can be improved substantially with upgraded radars, jammers, and helmet mounted targeting systems. The most cost effective upgrade may be a new datalink which allows aircraft to share target information. Air Force testimony to the House Appropriations Defense Committee in 1999 described the so-called "Link 16" datalink as "the most significant increase in fighter avionics since the introduction of the on-board radar." Tests with this $200,000 per aircraft upgrade to the FÂ–15 have demonstrated a five-fold increase in air combat kill ratios. While this upgrade makes the FÂ–15 five times more effective in the air combat mission, the Air Force only requires the FÂ–22 to be twice as effective as the FÂ–15. The Air Force has neglected to budget for this modestly priced upgrade for all its combat coded FÂ–15s.<br><br>The F-15 initial operational requirement was for a service life of 4,000 hours. Testing completed in 1973 demonstrated that the F-15 could sustain 16,000 hours of flight. Subsequently operational use was more severely stressful than the original design specification. With an average usage of 270 aircraft flight hours per year, by the early 1990s the F-15C fleet was approaching its service-design-life limit of 4,000 flight hours. Following successful airframe structural testing, the F-15C was extended to an 8,000-hour service life limit. An 8,000-hour service limit provides current levels of F-15Cs through 2010. The F-22 program was initially justified on the basis of an 8,000 flight hour life projection for the F-15. This was consistent with the projected lifespan of the most severely stressed F-15Cs, which have averaged 85% of flight hours in stressful air-to-air missions, versus the 48% in the original design specification.<br><br>Full-scale fatigue testing between 1988 and 1994 ended with a demonstration of over 7,600 flight hours for the most severely used aircraft, and in excess of 12,000 hours on the remainder of the fleet. A 10,000-hour service limit would provide F-15Cs to 2020, while a 12,000-hour service life extends the F-15Cs to the year 2030. The APG-63 radar, F100-PW-100 engines, and structure upgrades are mandatory. The USAF cannot expect to fly the F-15C to 2014, or beyond, without replacing these subsystems. The total cost of the three retrofits would be under $3 billion. The upgrades would dramatically reduce the 18 percent breakrate prevalent in the mid-1990s, and extend the F-15C service life well beyond 2014.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>F-15 Multi-Stage Improvement Program (MSIP)<br><br>Last revised March 4, 2000<br>Written by: Joseph Baugher<br><br>The Multi-Stage Improvement Program (MSIP) is a joint program carried out by McDonnell Douglas and the USAF's Warner Robins Logistics Center in Georgia. Under MSIP, upgrades were progressively incorporated onto the production line and then retrofitted to earlier production aircraft.<br><br>MSIP II is that portion of the program which handles the F-15C/D. The major part of MSIP II is to fit the APG-70 radar and the AIM-120 AMRAAM.<br><br>The Electronic Warfare Warning Set (EWWS) was modified into the more capable Tactical Electronic Warfare System (TEWS) with an ALQ-135 electronic countermeasures set and an upgraded ALR-56C radar warning receiver. An overload warning system was provided to prevent pilots from accidentally exceeding 9g during combat maneuvering.<br><br>The F-15C/D aircraft going through the MSIP II were fitted with the wiring needed to give them the capability of carrying and launching the AIM-120 AMRAAM missile, which was introduced into service in the early 1990s.<br><br>Another part of the MSIP II was the Seek Talk program, which was designed to reduce the vulnerability of the F-15's UHF radios to enemy jamming by introducing spread spectrum techniques and the use of a null steering antenna. Yet another was the Joint Tactical Information Distribution System (JTIDS), which is intended to provide high-capacity, reliable, and jam-proof information distribution between various elements of deployed forces and command and control centers. Another aspect of the MSIP is the integration of the F-15 with the Global Positioning Satellite (GPS). A new multi-function display armament control panel was introduced. New stick-top and throttle grips were added. The ECM equipment was improved, with ALR-56C RWR, ALQ-135B internal ECM system, and enhanced ALQ-128 being introduced.<br><br>The major part of MSIP II involved the development an upgraded AN/APG-63 radar, which is so much improved that is given the new designation of AN/APG-70. In this unit, the radar data processor memory was increased from 16K to 24K, and its processing speed was increased by a factor of three. The memory capability of the APG-63 radar fire control system was increased from 96K to 1000K and the processing speed was trebled. A Programmable Armament Control Set (PACS) was installed. The new unit has multiple bandwidths for high-resolution ground mapping using SAR technology. Several new radar modes were added, such as track-while-scan, which made it possible to ripple-fire up to four BVR missiles at separate targets simultaneously. The APG-70 radar also had a Low Probability of Intercept (LPI) capability, which makes it possible for it to detect and direct attacks on enemy aircraft without its emissions being easily seen by the enemy. The new processing power made available with the use of the new APG-70 radar made it practical to make use of Non-Cooperative Target Recognition (NCTR) technology, which provides the ability to distinguish more reliably between friendly and hostile aircraft. Much of the NCTR technology is highly "black" and very few details are available, but it reportedly makes it possible to avoid a lot of "friendly fire" accidents, such as the one that resulted in the loss of the IranAir Airbus in July of 1988.<br><br>The first MSIP II aircraft was F-15C 84-001, first flown on June 20, 1985. MSIP II was still underway at the time of the Persian Gulf war of 1991, and the AIM-120 AMRAAM was not yet ready for combat use. However, MSIP II F-15Cs were quickly despatched to the Gulf, and during the war they achieved an impressive kill ratio against Iraqi aircraft. The NCTR system was supposedly so good that it was able to identify aircraft by model and even by subvariant. There were no "friendly fire" incidents during the Gulf War, although there was a tragic incident after the war in which a couple of United Nations UH-60s were shot down, which indicates that the system is still not perfect.<br><br>It was orginally planned that almost all F-15A, B, C, and D versions were to go through the MSIP program. The A/B models that went through the MSIP were not to be fitted with the conformal fuel tanks of the C, but they were to be otherwise indistinguishable from the C. However, plans to include the F-15A/B in this program were abandoned as being too costly. Some of the very early As (from FY 1973, 1974, and 1975) were retired and made available as gate guards or were donated to museums. Others were retired to AMARC. Some of them were given to Israel as payment for policy decisions made during the Gulf War.<br><br><a href="http://www.airtoaircombat.com/background.asp?id=11&amp;bg=26" rel="nofollow">http://www.airtoaircombat.com/background.asp?id=11&amp;bg=26</a></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>The good news is this incident left the prospect unharmed...<br><br>------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br><br>DATE:11/11/07<br>SOURCE:Flight Daily News<br>Dubai 2007: <strong>Temporary problems leave EagleÂ’s bright prospects undimmed </strong><br><br>Although the F-15Â’s planned appearance at Dubai was disrupted by an accident and fleet-wide grounding, Boeing remains confident that the aircraft has a rosy future. Â“The F-15 is a terrific platform, and we have only satisfied customers, all of whom come back for more airplanes,Â” says Steve Winkler, drector of F-15 International Programs. We will continue in production well into the next decade. The Eagle will remain a vibrant part of the USAF for decades to come, with a robust road map for upgrades and capability expansion.Â”<br><br>All existing Eagle operators plan to keep their F-15 aircraft in service for many years to come, and all are actively pursuing upgrade and modernisation programmes to ensure that their F-15s remain viable, relevant and supportable, Winkler adds. The USAF itself plans to keep a Â‘Golden FleetÂ’ of around 178 F-15C/D fighter Eagles until around 2025, complementing the F-22A Raptor, while its 224 F-15E fighter-bombers will remain in service for even longer.<br><br>The F-15 is also still being marketed and sold to new customers, and <strong>Boeing now offer a new version of the Eagle.</strong> The original F-15E was a multi-role platform, with robust air-to-air capabilities, but it was optimised for the bomber role. BoeingÂ’s latest F-15 variants are more genuinely versatile and role-flexible, bringing together the latest features and capabilities of the air-to-ground optimised F-15E as well as those of the USAFÂ’s fighter F-15Cs.<br><br>Though it resembles a USAF Strike Eagle externally, the F-15K Slam Eagle developed for Korea is viewed by Boeing as being the first of a new generation of F-15 variants, combining the latest developments from the fighter F-15 and Strike Eagle variants in a single airframe for the first time.<br><br>The Slam EagleÂ’s bombing capability is based on a much-modernised and improved version of the Strike Eagle airframe, with a 15-station smart weapon capability. The USAF F-15E has just nine Â‘smart stationsÂ’. F-15K has six smart weapons stations on each CFT instead of only three on F-15E, as well as the centreline and underwing hardpoints. The redesigned cockpits have seven 6in by 6in Kaiser Electronics AMLCDs.<br><br>The new aircraft also has the same air to air capability as the most heavily upgraded USAF F-15Cs, with the JHMCS helmet sight and AIM-9X missiles. The aircraft uses the AN/APG-63(V)1 radar, originally designed as a reliability and maintainability upgrade for USAF Eagles, incorporating all of the AN/APG-70's air-to-air and air-to-ground modes while adding new capabilities for ground moving target indication and tracking, sea surface search/track, and enhanced high-resolution ground mapping. The F-15K is also fitted with a Lockheed Martin TIGER Eyes sensor suite, including the AN/AAS-42 infra-red search and track system.<br><br>The first 134 F-15Es were powered by the same 24,000lb Pratt &amp; Whitney F100-PW-220 turbofans as fighter F-15 variants, but from the 135th aircraft, F-15Es were powered by 29,100lb F100-PW-229 IPEs (Increased Performance Engines). The Korean aircraft are powered by the more powerful General Electric F110-GE-129A engine, which incorporates the core of the successful CFM56 commercial engine, and 3D aero technology as well as refinements to the combustor and high-pressure turbine.<br><br>As a result the F110-GE-129A promises to deliver a 25% reduction in cost per flying hour, with a significant reduction in maintenance and inspections. The engine also restores the EagleÂ’s performance even while carrying its maximum air-to-ground weapons load of 23,500lb.<br><br>The F110-engined F-15K also forms the basis of the F-15SG ordered by Singapore in December 2005, although the Singaporean version also incorporates an AESA AN/APG-63(V)3 radar.<br><br>The Korean and Singaporean orders will keep the F-15 production line running until 2012, and Boeing hopes to find further orders. A version of the F-15E has been proposed to satisfy Japan's F-X requirement, with an official request for proposals expected to be released in early 2008. Boeing says its submission, provisionally known as the F-15FX, is well placed in Japan, promising to be able to fulfil Japanese aspirations for local manufacture, and with an open architecture avionics system that will allow the integration of indigenous equipment.<br><br>Some features of the F-15K/F-15SG/F-15FX are also being offered as upgrades to existing Eagles. In the Middle East, the Royal Saudi Air Force (RSAF) has bought Eurofighter Typhoons to replace its ageing F-15C fighters, but plans to retain its 70 surviving F-15S Strike Eagles, and is upgrading these aircraft for continued service.<br><br>Most surprisingly, the RSAF has selected General Electric Company's F110 fighter engine to re-engine at least some of the aircraft, marking the first time that an F-15 operator has switched engine models. The agreement signed in September will see the procurement of 65 F110-GE-129C engines and a logistic support package, at a cost of more than $300 million.<br><br>It remains to be seen whether all 70 aircraft will be re-engined, in which case 155 engines would be required, or whether the RSAF will also undertake what has been described as a Â“massive recovery/re-sustainment plan of the current enginesÂ”. This involved purchasing 20 Pratt &amp;Whitney F100-PW-229 engines to restore and refurbish the Royal Saudi Air Force inventory of Pratt &amp; Whitney engines, together with new support equipment and engine improvement programme services.<br><br><a href="http://www.flightglobal.com/articles/2007/11/11/219340/dubai-2007-temporary-problems-leave-eagles-bright-prospects.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.flightglobal.com/articles/2007/11/11/219340/dubai-2007-temporary-problems-leave-eagles-bright-prospects.html</a></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>another surprise news<br>------------------------------------------------------------------<br><br>DATE:11/11/07<br>SOURCE:Flight International<br>Dubai 2007: Boeing forecasts Saudi order for 48 more F-15 fighters<br>By Craig Hoyle<br><br>Boeing is upbeat about its prospects in the global fighter market, despite the F-15's grounding for non-essential operations by Israel, Japan, Saudi Arabia and the USA in the wake of a 2 November crash. The decision followed the loss of a US Air National Guard F-15C, which is believed to have suffered a catastrophic structural failure during a routine training sortie. The aircraft's pilot ejected, suffering minor injuries.<br><br>The manufacturer, which says it is providing engineering support to the US Air Force during its investigation, recently received better news for its more than 35-year-old F-15 design, in the form of a follow-on order that will double the size of Singapore's F-15SG fleet to 24 aircraft by early next decade. Negotiations continue to supply South Korea with a second batch of 20 F-15Ks, and Boeing is also optimistic about securing a fresh deal with Saudi Arabia, reveals Chris Chadwick, vice-president/general manager global strike systems for the company's Integrated Defense Systems unit.<br><br>"We believe the Saudis are interested in new [F-15] aircraft," says Chadwick, citing concerns within the nation over the ongoing re-equipment of neighbouring Iran's armed forces. A decision on a follow-on package of 24-48 aircraft could come from Riyadh within the next two years, he believes. The Royal Saudi Air Force's 70-strong F-15S fleet is also undergoing an upgrade which will replace the type's Pratt &amp; Whitney F100-229 engines with General Electric F110-129Cs.<br><br>Other opportunities for the F-15 include a possible South Korean requirement for a further 60 fighters and via Japan's McDonnell Douglas F-4 Phantom replacement effort, says Chadwick.<br><br>Boeing is meanwhile also looking for continued success from its F/A-18E/F Super Hornet design, having earlier this year secured a first export sale, to supply Australia with 24 F-model strike aircraft from 2010. Chadwick believes the nation's air force could have a larger requirement for the type, potentially to also include the US Navy's EA-18G Growler electronic-attack aircraft.<br><br>The Super Hornet will also be offered to meet the Indian air force's 126-aircraft medium multi-role combat aircraft requirement, with Chadwick saying success in the nation would enable Boeing to go "truly global". Noting that New Delhi's requirement for a 50% defence offset proposal related to the fighter deal - which will exclude the final assembly of 108 of the aircraft by Hindustan Aeronautics - is "sporty and difficult", he says the company is nonetheless "optimistically bullish" about securing the deal.<br><br>Technical responses to India's request for proposals are due next March, with offset proposals to be submitted during June. Boeing faces competition from the Dassault Rafale, Eurofighter Typhoon, Lockheed Martin F-16, RSK MiG-35 and Saab Gripen for the estimated $12 billion deal. Other Super Hornet prospects are listed as including Japan, Kuwait and Switzerland, with the latter having an emerging requirement for 33 new aircraft.<br><br>Chadwick says Boeing is also trying to "introduce" potential buyers of the Lockheed F-35 Joint Strike Fighter to the capabilities of the Super Hornet, with the company potentially trying to persuade nations such as Norway - which continues to evaluate the Gripen and Typhoon alongside the JSF - to also consider its product. "The E/F gives them an alternative, or a bridge to whenever the F-35 comes," he says.<br><br>Boeing hopes to receive a decision within the next 18 months on a potential third multi-year procurement deal for the F/A-18E/F with the US Navy, which Chadwick says will reduce the fighter's fly-away unit cost from $53.8 million to $49.9 million. "The E/F is doing things in a cost and capability way that really goes against the grain," he says, predicting that the type could remain in production for the USN and export customers until at least 2015.<br><br><a href="http://www.flightglobal.com/articles/2007/11/11/219285/dubai-2007-boeing-forecasts-saudi-order-for-48-more-f-15-fighters.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.flightglobal.com/articles/2007/11/11/219285/dubai-2007-boeing-forecasts-saudi-order-for-48-more-f-15-fighters.html</a></div>
