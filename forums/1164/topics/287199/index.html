            <div class='col-md body'>Boeing Awarded Singapore Ministry of Defence Contract for Additional F-15SG Aircraft<br>ST. LOUIS, Oct. 22, 2007 -- The Boeing Company [NYSE: BA] today announced that the Singapore Ministry of Defence has exercised an option to purchase eight F-15SGs and has ordered four additional aircraft. The option is part of the original contract for 12 F-15SG aircraft announced by Singapore in 2005.<br><br>"We are proud that Singapore has chosen to acquire additional F-15SGs. The Strike Eagle is a combat-tested fighter with the most technologically advanced systems, and we are confident the F-15SG will meet the defense needs of Singapore," said Chris Chadwick, vice president and general manager, Global Strike Systems.<br><br>The Boeing F-15SG is a derivative of the U.S. Air Force F 15E Strike Eagle, the world's most capable long-range, multi-role fighter. It can simultaneously perform air-to-ground and air-to-air missions during day or night, in virtually any weather. It carries significant payload, reaches speeds in excess of Mach 2 and incorporates some of the most advanced military technologies. Integration and flight testing of the F-15SG will be performed at Boeing facilities in St. Louis and Palmdale, Calif., beginning in November.<br><br>Boeing has produced more than 1,500 F-15s. In addition to the United States, Korea, Japan, Saudi Arabia and Israel operate F-15 fleets.<br><br>A unit of The Boeing Company, Boeing Integrated Defense Systems is one of the world's largest space and defense businesses specializing in innovative and capabilities-driven customer solutions. Headquartered in St. Louis, Boeing Integrated Defense Systems is a $32.4 billion business with 72,000 employees worldwide.<br><br><a href="http://www.boeing.com/news/releases/2007/q4/071022b_nr.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.boeing.com/news/releases/2007/q4/071022b_nr.html</a></div>

Industry sources say that the 29,000lb (130kN) General Electric F110-GE-129 engine, which was selected to power the first 12 F-15SGs, has been selected for the second 12 as well.<br><br>Integration and flight testing of the aircraft will be at Boeing's St Louis, Missouri and Palmdale, California sites from November, the company says. Both batches of F-15s will have similar configurations, but Singapore has not released details.<br><br>A US Defense Security Cooperation Agency (DSCA) notification to the US Congress in 2005, however, said that the weapons included 200 AIM-120C AMRAAM missiles with six Captive Air Training (CAT) rounds, and 200 AIM-9X Sidewinder missiles with 24 CAT and dummy rounds.<br><br>For the air-to-ground role, the aircraft were to be supplied with 50 GBU-38 Joint Direct Attack Munitions and 30 AGM-154A-1 Joint Stand Off Weapons both with BLU-111 warheads, and 30 AGM-154C Joint Standoff Weapons.<br><br>Singapore was also to be supplied with 24 Link 16 multifunctional information distribution system/low volume terminals (fighter datalink terminals) and 44 pairs of AN/AVS-9(V) night vision goggles.<br><br>The aircraft are also likely to be fitted with the Raytheon AN/APG-63(V)3 active electronically scanned array radar, and the Data Device high-performance 1553 databus or HyPer-1553TM tested by the Boeing Phantom Works F-15E1 Advanced Technology Demonstrator aircraft.<br><br><strong>It has been speculated that Singapore will work with Israel to modify and upgrade its F-15s. The Israeli F-15I Ra'am (Thunder) is equipped with an Elisra SPS-2110 integrated electronic warfare system, and its crews wear DASH helmet sights. </strong><br><br>The F-15s will replace Singapore's fleet of McDonnell Douglas A-4 Skyhawks. A new round of procurement decisions to replace ageing Northrop F-5s with a new tactical fighter are due to start in 2008, with Singapore to choose between more F-15s and the Lockheed Martin F-35A Joint Strike Fighter.<br><br>Singapore aligned with the JSF programme in 2002 at the "security co-operation participant" level, the lowest rung of the four-tier international team.<br><br>The F-35's development delays have kept Singapore waiting for nearly two years for data about the country's unique final configuration, but this is expected in early 2008 and will launch a review phase allowing the service to choose either the F-35 or the F-15 for its next fighter purchase.<br><br><strong>Singapore also plans in 2008 to issue a shortlist for a requirement for advanced jet trainers, choosing among the Alenia Aermacchi M-346, BAE Systems' Hawk 128 and Korea Aerospace Industries T-50. It is also considering either a replacement or a mid-life update for its fleet of Fokker 50 maritime patrol aircraft.</strong></div>

The (V)3 antenna is lighter and less expensive, says Boeing.<br><br>The first ANG F-15Cs will be retrofitted in 2009 and stationed in Jacksonville, Florida. The guard plans to upgrade six to eight aircraft a year - enough to equip one base - for a total of around 50 AESA-equipped F-15Cs, the company says.<br><br><strong>Boeing's contract also includes the first (V)3 upgrade of an active USAF F-15C. This will serve as a spare for the (V)2-equipped aircraft in Kadena, but is the start of a plan to ultimately upgrade the 170 F-15Cs it plans to retain until 2025.<br><br>A competition to upgrade the USAF's 220 F-15E strike fighters with an AESA sensor is also under way, with Raytheon's APG-63(V)4 competing against a derivative of Northrop Grumman's APG-81 for the Lockheed Martin F-35 Joint Strike Fighter</strong>.<br><br><a href="http://www.flightglobal.com/articles/2007/10/22/218697/boeing-begins-f-15c-aesa-radar-upgrade.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.flightglobal.com/articles/2007/10/22/218697/boeing-begins-f-15c-aesa-radar-upgrade.html</a></div>

The suspension of flight operations is a precautionary measure.<br><br>The Air Force will ensure mission requirements are met for worldwide operations normally accomplished by the F-15. Current F-15 flying locations include bases in the continental United States, Alaska, England, Hawaii, Japan and the Middle East.<br><br>There are more than 700 F-15s in the Air Force inventory. The F-15 reached initial operational capability for the Air Force in September 1975.<br><br>While the F-15 continues to serve its country well, the Air Force is replacing its aging F-15 fighters with its fifth generation of air superiority, the F-22 Raptor. The F-22 is the world's most advanced fighter aircraft combining stealth, supercruise, maneverability and integrated avionics to provide unmatched warfighting capabilities in both air-to-air and air-to-ground missions.<br><br>The F-15 Eagle is an all-weather, extremely maneuverable, tactical fighter designed to permit the Air Force to gain and maintain air supremacy over the battlefield.<br><br>The F-15C, D and E models were deployed to the Persian Gulf in 1991 in support of Operation Desert Storm where they proved their superior combat capability. F-15C fighters accounted for 34 of the 37 Air Force air-to-air victories. The F-15E's were operated mainly at night, hunting SCUD missile launchers and artillery sites using the LANTIRN system.<br><br>They have since been deployed for air expeditionary force deployments and Operations Southern Watch -- the no-fly zone in Southern Iraq, Provide Comfort in Turkey, Allied Force in Bosnia, Enduring Freedom in Afghanistan and Iraqi Freedom in Iraq.<br><br><a href="http://www.af.mil/news/story.asp?id=123074547" rel="nofollow">http://www.af.mil/news/story.asp?id=123074547</a></div>
