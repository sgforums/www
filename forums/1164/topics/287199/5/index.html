Why did we move on to the Eagles and F-35s instead of sticking with more F-16s? Because we can do more today with lesser amounts of replacement aircraft due to their advanced nature.<br><br>The JASDF is not a very large force structure, and if they can get a force multiplier, why not. The Aussies are keen on the F-22s, because they need a 2-for-1 replacement of the F-111s and extra F-18s for medium strike roles.<br><br>As for us, the F-15SGs are probably destined to be replacement bomb trucks and deep strike aircraft, not fighters.</div>

Vietnam war and Korean war were clashes of ideologies that divided the world after WW2. Vietnam, Korea, AND China were divided into two and war of unification ensued, with the backing of their respective camps. Why should China be singled out as being a threat to SEA in the war of unification of Vietnam?<br><br>It was american's domino theory that suggested that SEA would fall once vietnam falls. And even if that were true, SEA would fall under communism, not Chinese! Now Vietnam defeated the american, is Vietnam under Chinese rule now?<br><br>Did you read why China invaded Vietnam? after the defeat of the american, vietnamese were expanding westward by attacking the khmer inside Cambodia, it was then Deng Xiao Peng decided to teach Vietnam a lesson by invading into Vietnam. they pulled out later, nobody won, nobody lost. How could we view that incident as China's threat to vietnam?   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_question.gif" alt="Question" title="Question"></div>

France few interests down in SEA today.  If you still want to consider France a "threat" to SEA, go ahead.<br><br>With the majority of the military clashes involving China, sinking of vietnamese gunboats, I don't see how any ASEAN nation not consider this to be a security matter of great importance.<br><br>I'm not saying that China is hell bent on projecting its military prowess to cower us into submission.  In fact, I feel that China has gone quite the opposite in positive diplomatic engagements with ASEAN.  However, with its last shot in anger fired less than 2 decades ago, its wise to remain vigilant.<br><br></div>
