            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by senate077:</div><div class="quote_body">actually, singapore do have other training stints that were never published in the papers. In 2000, a single company from 1 guards actually participated in the US JRTC in texas with the US 25th infantry division (air assault force which is US's version of heliborne ops). The training involved sending our troops to hawaiis schofield barracks whr they were stationed to accustomed to their training doctrine and before eventually going over to texas for the actual exercise. Most of Sg troops used the US M16A2 with some being issued carbine and their MGs as they were not allowed to used our own weapon. </div></blockquote>I can confirm that as my unit received the reciprocal training for the US troops from the 25 Div in Singapore. But they sent a small representation, mainly helicopter chaps and not infantry over.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>actually the thing i like about the way the air assault brigade is the way they land driectly on the objective and attack. they rely alot on air support and artillery fire. in sg, we land far n walk there. the unit that we were attached to were called wolfhounds. the JRTC span ard 13 to 15 days and we were involved in three different scenarios. the enemies(op4s) were very professional. they were a paratrooper unit station in fork polk. they actually inserted 3 days into the area of ops to set up their defence against us. they operate in small grps or section. very fast n agile. caches of ammos n food were found hidden by them. in a town that they defended, they actually set up 300 rolls of con wires. in sg, we cut white tapes to simulate. in US, u r expected to cut the con wires to breech. i also like the way that you actually see cooperation of actual armour (bradleys n M1A1)  n aircrafts throughout the exercise. A-10 attack aircrafts were dropping flares above at nite, also got to see B1 bombers. my oc had a light attack copter for close air support while 2 sections were combing an area where suspected op4s were spotted by the copter. we also saw russian aircrafts that were operated by the op4s during the mission.<br><br>in the wallaby i went to in 2000, although we had all these elements, but armour n airforce had their own exercise. imagine while engagin a possible tank target, we had to ask umpire if it was the correct target as the tanks were actually landrovers n tonners with light sticks. umpire ask us to see the color of light stick, our response was that our nvg n nighthawks can only see green n nothin else. in the end umpire had to coms other side to ask. hahaaa.<br>i do hope to see more cooperation between the different units during atual exercise. so did anyone went to the most recent wallaby? has it changed much? but can't blame SAF as the US army has the largest budget in the world.</div>
