This must be accomplished before the beginning of the fall semester you would enter UC Berkeley.  SAT I and SAT II tests are required for all freshman applicants (see Required Tests). The TOEFL or IELTS test is required if English is not your native language (see TOEFL / IELTS).</span><br><br><span style="color: red;">Singapore:  Three Advanced Level examinations are required for admission, with a grade of "C" or higher in each. The engineering degree programs at UC Berkeley are academic and research-oriented; students who have completed diploma programs after Ordinary Level examinations are not eligible for admission.<br><br>NOTE:   Countries that Require Military Service after Secondary School:  Students from countries that require entry into military service upon completion of secondary education should not apply until that obligation has been met. UC Berkeley does not defer admission to a later term.</span><br><br>NOTE: If you have completed post-secondary course work after graduating from secondary school, you are not eligible for freshman admission.
