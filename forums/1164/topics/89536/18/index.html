Is it the same kind of suffering as in Afghanistan or Sudan? How about the suffering in N Korea? Or simply suffering because of their own material needs?<br><br><strong>UMNO almost won , it's just that the books you read is all censored by the govt..if PAP lose in malay constituencies...would you think the education ministry will report on it?</strong><br><br>So? Get with the program. Some of us here are not particularly fond of our government but at least non of us hate our country. We all stand behind our armed forces.<br><br><strong>M'sia has more 4th Generation aircraft types then singapore namely those designed in the 70's and 80's like SU-30 (which came from SU-27)<br>and MIG-29 and F/A-18..</strong><br><br>Sure they do, like what someone pointed out earlier, go get yourself 1 M1A1, 1 F22 and 1 Ticonderoga CG and pit yourself against our entire arsenal then. We'll see who wins in the end.<br><br><strong>Yes , i estimate about 80%<br><br>80% troops will charge into m'sia..using barefoot i think..</strong><br><br>This takes the cake. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br><strong>Singapore has over 1000 tanks + bionix and vehicles..i read in defense magazine..imagine 5 pple inside 1 tank<br><br>that means 5,000 personnel<br><br>Singapore has over<br><br>In Singapore, 300,000 troops...so assuming each bionix<br><br>Ive calcuated this with information taken from mindef.<br><br>yes and that is all of mindef's available weaponry now..<br>i basically assume singapore doesn't have any other weapons other then those listed in mindef.gov.sg<br><br>Singapore has less then 50 naval vessels..asumming each vessels uses 60 pple on average..<br><br>That means over 3,000 personnel + 2000 support<br><br>Then the remaining pilots assuming singapore has 200 planes + 10,000 personnel to support.<br><br>that means air force + navy + army..more then 20,000 pple that also means the arty,tanks and airforce and navy all used up..<br><br>So when these pple advance ..they will be using SAR-21 hence i use this conclusion<br><br>Singapore is likely to keep some troops for fear of tanks and stuff..<br>so singapore will keep 40,000 reserve troops to guard home land defense<br><br>so 40,000 + 3,000 + 2,000 + 5,000 + 10,000  = 60,000 which is 20% of the saf forces..<br><br>The remaining 80% therefore will not have access to jet fighters/tanks/ships<br>so therefore i will assume they will move up..<br><br>So i assume 80% will use SAR-21 and chiong </strong><br><br>Excellent deduction.
