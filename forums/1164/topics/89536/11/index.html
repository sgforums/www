During a battalion exercise, a gun commander was acting BSM for his battery (not mine thank goodness).   After O Group and briefed about the route, he somehow managed to make a wrong turn and ended up at the Causeway.   The convoy that he led had to make a U-turn at the Singapore custom checkpoint.   I wished I could have seen the look of the Malaysians' faces as the gun battery went past the checkpoint <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">.<br><br>Anyway, I am happy to say that the commander was immediately replaced as acting BSM and signed a few extras for his cock-up.
