He is unable to pull himself out of the game even when the game is not running on his PC. apparently, the game is still running, maybe in an infinite loop or a severe 'division by zero' error, in his brain (yes, he do have one minus the small size). Hence, unless we can stop the process path of RA.exe (Generals.exe in the case of C&amp;C Generals) in his brain, we are unable, using current technology, to help Mr Sibeh in his problem. We are currently closely monitoring the situation and will submit a formal report in a few weeks time to his parents to conclude if he still requires treatment here. Under normal conditions, he is deemed suitable, for both the public and his personal wellbeing, to go out alone without supervision from us or his parents. We have already suggested, to both Mr Sibeh and his parents, to slowly cut down the amount of time he spends playing war-related games like Command &amp; Conquer, Medal of Honour etc. We have also found out that he like to assume a role of a top secret government official who has many spies working for him and has access to all top-secret documents. We have already advised his parents to keep on re-inforcing to him that the fact is he is just a normal person and not what he THOUGHT himself to be. If he do not snap out of fantasy and embrace reality as it is, he will require a longer course of treatment here. This is something that we will not like to see.

You cross that thin line first, or you so brain damage that you forgot !!!<br><br><blockquote><br><strong>"umm , it's wrong to visit a bar without ur wife's permission..  where's ur wife? "</strong> </blockquote>You cross that line when you say that .<br><br>You cross that line which even the SAF dare not cross, you started a personal war. Since you like it so much !!! Send my fucking regards to your whole fucking family and wish them a fucking merry christmas and a fucking new year, and tell them what a fucking good son they have .<br><br>Don't start any war which you cannot swallow ! That the last warning, one more time. If you ever cross that line again, I will make sure it get so personal, and don't assume that you are well hidden behind that computer, I will visit you in person to wish them a fucking happy labor day and a fucking national day too.<br><br></div>
