Thus they will become double agents and available for our service. It is through the information brought by the double agent that we are able to acquire and employ local and inward spies. It is owing to his information, again, that we can cause the doomed spy to carry false tidings to the enemy.<br>- Sun Tzu quotes<br><br>If asked how to cope with a great host of the enemy in orderly array and on the point of marching to the attack, I should say: "Begin by seizing something which your opponent holds dear; then he will be amenable to your will." Rapidity is the essence of war: take advantage of the enemy's unreadiness, make your way by unexpected routes, and attack unguarded spots.<br>- Sun Tzu<br><br>Throw your soldiers into positions whence there is no escape, and they will prefer death to flight. If they will face death, there is nothing they may not achieve.<br>- Sun Tzu<br><br>The last quote kind of applies to Singapore position huh?<br><br>darn i don't know that BX is a MBT!<br>rofl..damn im so dumb.<br><br>damn ...me have low IQ.....looks like time to read military magazine again</div>
