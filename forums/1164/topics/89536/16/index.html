            <div class='col-md body'>Notice something. He keeps stressing on the fact that if S'pore ever goes to war with M'sia, M'sia will win.  First &amp; foremost, he seems to forget that so far, whatever conflict we have with M'sia was created BY M'sia.<br><br>They are the ones who agreed to the price of water &amp; now they regret it.  So? Is it our problem?  And no country will allow the customs to be brought INTO the country itself.  Its like asking M'sia to shift their checkpoint from JB to Muar. YOu think they will allow it?  As for Pedra Branca, ICJ has already ruled in favour of S'pore so there's not much to say liao.<br><br>Secondly, I wonder why he is so keen for S'pore to carry M'sia's balls.  Possibility number 1, he's a M'sian pretending to be a S'porean.  Possibility number 2, he has no testicles &amp; will be the first to run to M'sia &amp; wave the M'sian flag if war does break out.<br><br>Whatever it is, I think we have all seen his true colours.  Its bad enough that he goes around talking as if he's some military expert.  And its bad enough that he thinks Red Alert mirrors real life.  But if all that is not bad enough, he has shown that he has absolutely no confidence in SAF &amp; in S'pore and he think we should carry M'sia's balls.<br><br>All I can say is that with ppl like him around, its no wonder if our country does indeed one day go kaputs. When all is well, he will sit on his arse &amp; play Red Alert. But if things go awry, he will run across the causeway, waving a M'sian flag &amp; saying "don't sodomise me, I'm one of your own".   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>I pity his parents for giving birth to such a piece of sh<strong></strong>it!!  I know the govt is encouraging parents to give birth, but to all adults out there, if you are gonna give birth to someone with the same mentality as this fu<strong></strong>cker, please do us a favour &amp; don't give birth at all, because the last thing we need are traitors like him!!!
