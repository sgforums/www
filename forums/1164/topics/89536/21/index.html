No special information has been leaked , throughout my visit<br>Other then a minor one , regarding BX , which i will not reveal here<br><br>2. Looks like the form you all signed and the pledge you all took,<br>you all stand by it.<br><br>3. You all know the real military stuffs, well despite my psychoing and my<br>information given to make the military "fact" look real<br><br>4. You all bothered to check , whether it is correct or not<br><br>5. You all assume, im a NCC kid, without checking my IC<br><br>6. You all automatically believe some of the stuffs i say about myself.<br><br>7. At this point in time , I believe that the moderators at SAF forums are more<br>"active" then Military Nuts forums<br><br>Thereby , i applaud you all , for withstanding the sheer pressure and the urge to reveal some top-secret stuffs which has been told you to you all.<br><br>Despite my frequent tauntings of the weakness of SAF and frequent "distortions" to try to weaken your morale, not only have i boosted your morale , you all have banded up and united against 1 common person.<br><br>This is a strong signal that , SAF is definitely going to soar on to a higher level and there can't be no mistake about the true identify of the forumites<br>who posted here: Warriors.<br><br>After monitoring this forum for quite some time , only then i had started this account with some agendas in mind<br><br>1. To simulate a fake scenario and bait you to have the urge to reveal<br>the "silver bullets" with previous threads ive created<br><br>2. To confuse you all by putting real information and fake information :<br>to see if you all have problems distinguishing real and fake info  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"><br><br>3. To make myself seem totally unbelievable at times ; to test how much<br>you are willing to fight for the country and how much do you know<br>how much loyalty do you have , whether do you live up to your OATH<br><br>4. To trick you all<br><br>5. Act like an idiot , and see what kind of replies i would get<br>(btw if i don't act like an idiot , i wouldn't know "how much you really know<br>about the real military information" cause the posts which is in reply to<br>what ive posted "will correct me" )<br><br>and lastly , im a Singaporean-Chink. and take care.<br>and im also not from MINDEF or MSD (what is MSD??)<br><br>up to you all to believe me now..that ive laid the cards down<br><br>Showhand!</div>
