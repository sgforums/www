This is because SiBeiSuayKai have very small cockroach's brain which if fill with too much information, get swollen and explode. When explode will be very messy, very foul smell that last for weeks. That why SAF have those chemical suit soldiers too, just in case of possible SiBeiSuayKai brain explode, they are the clean up team.<br><br>SAF classified a lot of things, and only publish out basic and simple things in pioneer magzaine only,  they also make sure NCC does not have a lot of information. All because of a nation effect in preventing  the cockcoach called SiBeiSuayKai from exploding due to lack of brain size to store information.<br><br>By the way if you looking for the article on the SiBeiSuayKai species of cockroach, you will not find it in NCC manuals or Pioneer Magzines. It is classified also. But every SAF folks will read it within the 1st week of BMT, as it is under the basic military training guide - chapter 5 - how to identify pests and terminate them, duty of every soldiers !!!<br><br>let see the method of terminating SiBeiSuayKai in that chapter include :<br>1) drown him<br>2) baynonet him<br>3) burn him<br>4) shoot him<br>5) use landrover run over him<br>6) use genade<br>7) gas him<br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"> hang him<br>...<br>....<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Thanks for all the useful info contributed by the senior members here. Please don't talk about classified stuff if you know any. My aim is to get useful constructive suggestions to solve problems perceived by myself. Yes, i acknowledge that some of our younger members have an extensive knowledge on military affairs but pls let me remind you that what is on the books or net may not be the real thing! Sometimes you just have to do it personally eg go through NS. I think any direct assault on a beachhead is the last thing anyone wants. An example is the USMC, even when they are considered one of the most well trained and equipped in the world,they are still not sent to establish a beachhead Normandy style like in Gulf War 1. However, my opinion is that even though we tried to avoid it,we must still have the capability to mount such an assault. This is to show our potential enemies that we as a small nation are not to be push around. As for the amphibous capabilities of our armoured forces, i think its public knowlege that our two variants of AMX-20,Bronco and BX can swim. BX is not very effective as compared to our Ultra(upgraded M113) because preparations are necessary to prepare BX for river crossings. What i am concerned about is that we have a lack of MBTs or light tanks which can swim. Those senior SAF personnel will know this. I am wondering if its feasible to get some. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>More practical to insert lightfighters by sea and airdrop your armoured assets by air.Thus you might avoid the time lag taken while your men are already on land while your logistics is a nightmare due to preparation of non-organic amphibious assets.MBTs or light tanks need not be "swimmable", what we need are APCs or IFVs that are amphibious.We need a Bradley-type of IFV to secure a temporary zone for our MBTs to land.Currently our BX and Ultras, might not be up to the task.Is it feasible to create a BX with a real tank destroyer capability?E.g twin Spike ATGMs and applique armour ?Nowadays, its the rapid light armor that secures the territory  first, while the MBTs provide back-up and direct assault capability for urban situations, provided they are armored on the to pand around the engine ventings, as its much safer for Armored Infantry and direct shelling to be used rather than foot assault.We need cover, lots of it.</div>
