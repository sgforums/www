Read up books of chemical warfare boy !!!<br><br>1) You think we parade our heli on parade square out in the open for Astro to hit ? The more important ones are in harden shelters that can withstand even a direct hit from Astro.<br><br>2) ASTROS vs PRIMUS, wrong comparsion 2 are design for different thing.<br>First thing the Primus is design for direct armour fire support ( that why it does not have longer range). It job is to follow the armour group and help it to attack anything it come across. The Primus armoured to protect it from Astros attack.<br><br>Boy you think SAF will send Apache into Malaysia without 1st getting air-superiority !!! Dumb !!! You think the Mig29 will still be in the sky ? When we have air-superiority, you think we cannot detect where the astro launch is from and not bomb the shit out of them.  You frankly think with Singapore technology advance in arms design, that we cannot build multi-rocket launchers like astro if we wants to ?<br><br></div>
