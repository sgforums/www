            <div class='col-md body'>I'm sure after his two yrs of NS, his ideas would change. Battles are not fought on paper, and based on who has more fire power on paper. A good plan by a good leader with average to mediocre troops definitely has a better fighting chance than a poor leader with bad plans and superior troops. History will atest to that.<br><br>Just a little advice, if ur still in NCC, though u might THINK u know a lot, try not to present urself in such a proud manner. There are many of us here who have served and seen a lot, and from different persepectives. Paper war and real ops are very different. Just because someone has the equipment doesn't mean they know how to utilise it to its optimum result. Maintenance and spares are another factor nobody ever puts on paper.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I didn't read all the previous posts on this thread so I don't know what the story is so far.<br><br>But here's my armchair general's 2 cents : )<br><br>SAF definitely has the capability to launch amphibious assaults, but exactly what scale I don't pretend to know.<br><br>But SAF is prepared for amphibious operations and most of us in infantry would've done at least a little training in it.<br><br>And amphibious operations will definitely be used by either sides if Malaysia and Singapore comes to blow. That's why in PDF we actively conduct excercises in coastal defence.<br><br>Singapore will definitely do amphibious assaults as Malaysia is a peninsula with a long coastline and they do not have enough troops to defend the every inch of it. So amphibious assault is a good option.<br><br>When we say amphibious operations don't think of D-Day or Guadalcanal as those were major assaults.<br><br>Singapore will use amphibious assaults probably as a flanking move. If intel points out a undefended coastline suitable for landing that will be where a secondary or diversionary or flanking assault would take place.<br><br>For example if we are fighting them across the causeway - whomever is invading whom - we can use coastal hooks to flank their main force and force them to divert troops. This would disrupt their rear or cut off their supply lines etc. You can imagine all the scenarios where this would be useful.<br><br>Amphibious assaults have often been successful as coastlines are usually too long to be completely defended. But for Singapore someone pointed out correctly we do not have the capability of making this the main thrust.<br><br>Airborne is not an option for main thrust as we all know very well how precious few airborne troopers we have. And big scale airborne ops are more costly and have an even smaller chance of success than big scale amphibious ops. Look at WW2 for examples.<br><br>In airborne ops it is more difficult to ferry in heavy equipment like tanks and arty as the equipment, ammo (for arty) and crew are dropped separately. (My guess-ti-mation.) After dropping the crew would have to find their tank and if they don't find it in time all is lost.<br><br>Whereas if an LST successfully lands a tank on the beach it is immediately able to fight its own way up.<br><br>This aside, apparently Malaysia has a much larger airborne capability than we do, according to some sources. But if our air-defences are still intact we'll slaughter them even before cross the Johore Straits.</div>
