Components can be disassembled yes but the parts are all controlled and most are monitored by the CIA. An ICBM is not something you can hide in a briefcase.<br><br>And Y would we need to get one if we dun have LONG DISTANCE targets? Assuming China declares war (idiotic fantasy), which countries would they have to go thru. If you're gonna reply by sea, start reading up on your politics. Their agenda is Taiwan, not us. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"> You think China capable of launching large scale amphibious assault on us why not settle their Taiwan headache first. Still adamant on getting nuke is a good thing? Read:<br><br><span style="color: black;"><span class="large">[b]BIG FAT WASTE OF MONEY</span></span></strong>[/b]</blockquote>[/b]<br><br>Yeah brother.. agreed on ur pt...and  Too much resources will be deployed by China just to hit Singapore with a ICBM,  While there is an possibility in every single thing on earth.. its like using a MBT to clear a spider web... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_eek.gif" alt="Shocked" title="Shocked">   it only reflect how "intelligent" the military leaders and politicians of the long distance country are, to hit SPore with an ICBM, wiping us out, without gaining anything back.. when we are not a thorn in their flesh... Waste their $$ and not gaining in any other way... unlike our immediate neighbours, wiping us out MIGHT benefit them , less competition economically, but also lost of income from SPORE... its a double edged sword...<br>When China have to destroy a country without gaining anything ,  it will be ROC, to "save their own face" rather than destroy Spore , where it is illogical. Yes there is the slightest possibility, but i guess the only person who will make that type of decision, will be NCC boys... hiaz..</div>

Might as well invite our neighbours to occupy us like Indonesia to East Timor. You, who have not even been through a single maneuvre, have no credibility to tell us what we should be doing when you do not understand it in the first place.<br><br>Nukes are strategic weapons, so is water and oil. Just how will you react if our neighbours suddenly decides to get a nuke?
