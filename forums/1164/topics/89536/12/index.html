            <div class='col-md body'>So basically you are saying that since S'pore is so hopelessly outgunned &amp; out numbered, we should just drop our balls &amp; do everything that M'sia and/or Indonesia says, since they are so "gracious" to let us reside in S'pore, and in the event of war, we should just throw down our arms &amp; sign peace treaties.<br><br>Well that being the case, might as well just disband the SAF &amp; pay the MAF to defend us. Better still right? Why don't we just open our borders &amp; tell M'sia that they can come in anytime they want to do anything they want. Isn't that even better?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>Please lah!  In the first place, war between S'pore and M'sia will be a very complicated issue since ppl on both sides have relatives on both sides. Just as much as certain politicians worry about whether our Malays will be willing to kill M'sians during war, I'm sure M'sia worries about that too.  Whether Malay, Chinese or Indian, most of us have relatives across the border &amp; that makes it that much more complex. And don't forget, S'pore &amp; M'sia are both members of ASEAN &amp; also FPDA. That complicates things even further.<br><br>But first &amp; foremost, we should remember that SAF has always been meant to defend S'pore, we never intended for it to be an offensive force. No one (at least not anyone logical) is saying the SAF will kick MAF's butt in the event of war &amp; that MAF will be a pushover. What we are saying however, is that despite our size, we are certainly capable of giving MAF a bloody nose &amp; a bruised testicle should they decide to invade us.<br><br>The keyword here gentlemen is DETERENCE.  We build up an armed force which MAY or may not be powerful enough to defeat the enemy during war time, but this force first &amp; foremost is to DETER the enemy. So that they do not think they can just stroll past us. So that they will think twice before invading, knowing full well that they too will suffer significant casualties.<br><br></div>
