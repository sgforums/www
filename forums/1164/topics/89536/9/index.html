Japan is 6 months away from having nuclear weapons at any point of notice. If the PM wants a nuke warhead at his backyard, he can get it through nuclear analyst within 6 months time.

Will you??</blockquote>America jolly know that 500 Million of their souls will burn in inferno if engaged in a nuclear exchange so do the russians, so do the Indians and the Pakistani.

It could devastate our surface infrastructure, our naval fleets, our surface assets. Although we have a number of underground facilities, all these facilities with their assets will be useless without surface infrastructure of runways, radars and even dual role civilian sites. Unless the launch of the Astros2 can be stop, a large number of it can certainly bring our SAF to a halt.

We need to debate even if we should use nuclear power generation and not depend on oil and gas.<br><br>I am glad at least in singapore it is the civilian government that control the military, we are doomed if a real general think like you.</blockquote>How many chernonbyl examples are there in the world?<br><br>Because of the 911, must we tear Westin Stamford down?<br><br>Because of the birdflu, must we kill all the birds in Birdpark?<br><br>Because of the crash in Arizona, must we halt all flights in Singapore?<br><br>Because of the threat of Terrorism, must we not support what we find that it is best for our interest?<br><br>It is people like you whom will not advance in this world.

My solution to the problem is to obtain WMD as a counterbalance.

However, based on pictures and information given to the Sunday Times in 1987 by nuclear whistleblower Mordechai Vanunu, experts have determined that Israel has dozens, perhaps hundreds, of nuclear bombs.<br><br>Sharon said the United States backed Â“<strong>IsraelÂ’s right to defend itself by itself against threats at any place and to preserve IsraelÂ’s deterrent power against all threats</strong>Â”.<br><br>In Washington, a US State Department official would say only that the United States supported IsraelÂ’s right of self defence.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>The reason why Singapore maintains relatively good internation relationships with other countries is because of our "don't interfere policy". We don't tell other people what to do, in return we ask (and subsequently ignore) what others tell us to do. We generally support the UN, do not overtly offend any country, and avoid committing internation boo-boos.<br><br>Making/buying/possessing WMD will be an international boo-boo.<br><br>It would turn all our international relationships to hell, not to mention it's a high possibility it could make half the UN more unfriendly and reluctant to cooperate with us. While countries might not be able to stop us, they WOULD turn unfriendly. In all of Singapore's trade agreements with external powers there probably are clauses that concern WMD. Once we possess WMD, they might be able to break off the treaty. eg. US might impose restrictions on trade. Furthermore which company would dare to invest in Singapore if it purchased WMD ? They would, either take it as a sign that we are gearing up for war; or not take the chance of a nuclear accident and pull all their resources out of the country.<br><br>Trade with Pakistan anyone ?<br><br>Remember Singapore is a small country with no natural resources; trade, research &amp; development, technology is our only way to maintain 1 step head in the region. We are NOT self sufficient, ie we cannot survive on our own like those other superpowers. All these things <strong>depend on external factors and investments.</strong> If we don't get money/resources from external investments, we lose this edge. And in peace time now, we <strong>CANNOT</strong> afford to fall behind other countries if we are to maintain all our present lifestyles.<br><br>Governing a country is not just about the military, nor the people. It consists of so many other factors that we (ie trade commerce), the common people are just not aware of. That's why we have all the scholars (whom so many people hate) in the military, their level of thinking is 1 or even 2 levels higher than us. They might not be able to "chiong suah", but they've considered factors that all of us have never even dreamt of before making their desicion(s), and all the while we are complaining on the ground w/o knowing the whole truth.<br><br>IMO, politics has won more wars than military strength. It's all depends on who you manage to get on your side of the war.<br><br>So far all of the pro-WMD arguments are all one-dimensional and concern <strong>ONLY</strong> the Singaporean military viewpoint. Of course, if i'm looking at purely our <strong>OWN</strong> military concerns, it could be a plus point if Singapore could get WMD as a form of deterrance through MAD. But there are so many other international factors not considered.<br><br>**********<br><br>btw, SSK, how old are you exactly? From what i've seen you haven't even enlisted yet. Not that there's anything wrong with that but you have to understand that reading up about something, is a hell lot different from experiencing/doing it.<br><br>In reference to your "reseach" on Singapore surviving a direct nuclear hit, even assuming all that you've said is true (which i highly doubt), have you considered the aftermath ? Given Singapore's small size, a nuclear incident would hurt a lot. Imagine an land area the size of AMK + Bishan + Toa Payoh totally gone. The nuclear fallout ? The wind (remember Singapore is an ISLAND surrounded by seas) which will blow the radioactive particles everywhere affecting thousands more ? The psychological state of our people even if they survive ? This isn't SARs that took away hundreds of lives and in the process bonded our people. This is a nuke falling on our heads which will cause casualties in numbering in the tens (maybe even hundreds) of thousands. And that's not adding the number of people suffering from after effects. Our entire social and medical system and country can collapse under this strain. The people might survive the initial blast, but can they <strong>ever</strong> recover from the aftermath ? Can we afford to take this risk ?</div>
