            <div class='col-md body'>I must say that the kid is quite "impressive" in his knowledge, both political and military.  Thanks for the good laugh you have provided me over the last few days with your postings. They are indeed entertaining!<br><br>1st you condemned educated generals saying you prefer hokkien peng generals anytime. Then you whined about walking 10 km. I wouldnt even call you a desktop general. A general title is abit too high for u.  True you have the knowledge but your interpretation of scenarios is super childish and in some cases lacking of humility.<br><br>I am hoping that NS will do you some good. Go get some experience in handling people before you even come talk about military politics/strategies. Your desire for knowledge and grasp of some facts are assets but there are some other things you need to work on. Don't argue just for the sake of arguing.</div>

I think that is what we want above having a war and watch who have the better soldiers.<br><br>Im afraid that with the development of our neighbours in could be very real in the future that they have supremacy over Singapore in military numerical strength. It is always possible to use technology to  bargain with numerical strength, however if the ratio is over the equilibrium of balance or even worst our neighbours have both technology and numbers, there is no way Singapore can balance the strength, no way we can form a deterrent except to possess WMD. It is this reason why Israel and Pakistan goes nuclear, why Taiwan wants to join the club and why Japan is six months in any notice to have nuclear weapons.<br><br></div>

No way man. Just imagine , if we were at the point of February 1942 , 2 days before official surrender, the British soldiers got nothing to lose<br>if they got 1 ICBM at the time for example, if they don't fire , they still will die<br>if fire, they also still will die , i might still fire the stuff towards Tokyo<br><br>Thats where the whole concept is, when you got nothing to lose and everything to gain from destruction of enemy, Why not? Just press the button<br><br>I approve of Singapore having WMD, but rather i let it keep secret.<br>Let it be...Hopes that the Condominium 999 years stays true for 999 years to come!<br><br>Even if singapore don't have , nevermind , but 1 day unless singapore population is perhaps 1/2 or on par with the enemy, then we can set our mind at ease.., its just a matter of time between 200+ million and 5 million...<br><br>Unless we wanna import more people from china to help us do our job ,<br>But Singapore needs space only enough space for 700,000 homes ,and a country's population will always increase..<br><br>Anyway , ive done a calculation , and i got good news for you all after 10 days of research , Singapore cannot be entire destroyed by even the MOST powerful nuclear bomb, =D<br><br>Why? Cause last time the atomic bomb,on hiroshima  which was used was used on wooden villages and etc..homes poorly build, SG is heavily built with HDB to cushion the damage.<br><br>Anyway , nuclear bombs cannot go through that easily through concrete, primary stuff given out is gamma radiation , and most kind of silverish reflective surfaces helps to lower down the radiation.<br>(unless lar, your concrete house is made of clay..then i will pray for you when that day comes)<br><br>Radiation sickness also occurs when your far from the bomb site, most important thing to do is not to expose yourself.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>hello sibeisuaykia<br><br>From reading your posts, I have to compliment your enthusiasm for the military  but do try to peer deeper into what you are reading. Many of the references you quoted are from online sources which many are of dubious academic credibility.<br><br>The bad blood between the Arabs and Israelis did not stem from just the outcome of the 6 Day war. It is the cruel result of a long historical interaction between the 2 races since Jewish emigration to Palestine began in the 19th century<br><br>The Lebanon invasion was not an israeli success. The Israeli army performed very poorly against the Lebanese irregulars and the Syrians, with deep flaws being revealed in the Israeli army training and doctrine. For an excellent introduction to the IDF and its fallacy, the "Weld Report" (I am not sure if you can find online) by the IDF LTC Emmanuel Weld and "the Sword and the Olives" by Martin van Creveld are excellent. The Weld Report is particularly interesting as many of us have been brought to believe in the excellence of the IDF. This book was the result of an investigation carried out by the said author when tasked by the IDF CDF to find out the cause of the poor Israeli performance in Lebanon and Yom Kippur. The report was leaked and caused an uproar in Israel, leading the Weld sacking. No one likes to hear bad news I guess.<br><br>The safety confered by a buffer zone in the case of Israel is only 1 side of the coin. Think about why the Israelis chose to unilaterally withdraw from the Lebanese buffer zone in the late 1990s and how the occupation of the Sinai contributed to the strategic surprise in Yom Kippur as well as the chaos of the 1st few days of the battle ie the failure of the Israelis to realise the the occupation of the Sinai has increased their internal line of communication and the subsequent time required for mobilisation and transport to the battlefield<br><br>The 3G transformation involves more than just a quantum leap in technology. In fact technology is not the most crucial component of the equation for what good is the power of networking if the commanders are still stuck in a 1G or 2G way of doing things. For a good guide to what is transformation in the SAF, read the two Pointer Monographs - "Defence Entreprenuership in the 21st Century" and "Realising intergrated knowledge-based command anc control in the SAF", both of which are available online on the Pointer Website.<br><br>Based on your reading of generalship and strategy, I am surprise by your dismissal of the importance of the issue of rations and morale. You are wrong. A good general will pay very close attention to the morale of the soldiers and feeding them is part of it. War is more than weapons and battles have been won by armies boasting inferior hardware but superior software.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"> Of course there are 2 side of the coin.<br><br>Has it occured to you why in the height of the Cold War, why SALT (Strategic Arms Limitation Talk) was implemented or why in the Second World War, biological and chemical weapons were not used by the European combatants? WMD is not a panacea and brings with it many moral, ethical and politcial issues. Developing WMD in Singapore's case for security guarantee may just increased Singapore's insecurity by sparking of a regional arms race   and forever banish our hopes for  normal, peaceful relationships with our neighbours. How would you feel if you know your neighbour has the power to annihilate you? Of course you would fear him but would you treat him with goodwill or cooperate with him?<br><br>Your understanding of a nuclear fall out is gravely wrong. The fall out of even a kiloton size bomb would be disasterous for Singapore. Read a proper book on the physics of nuclear weapons and avoid the online websites.<br><br>You have been criticised by a lot of people in this forum and I do not believe in flaming a teenager. Knowing hardware and facts is insufficient. You also think about their context and how they would relate to our situation. I discerned a certain intellectual arrogance and tunnel-vision complex about you  . The more people criticise you, the more defensive you become. Criticism hurts and people may be crude about you but think beyond the crudeness and look at the substance of their criticism. Learning is a continuous process and you would never learn enough. You should know the price of arrogance between success and failure in battles based on your reading. You know about transformation and for transformation in the SAF to work, open mindedness to new knowledge and practise is crucial. Be humble for no great general is infallible.<br><br>I didnt mean to post such a long message but boredom leads people to do strange things. Sorry for the long-windedness to all !<br><br></div>

It is always possible to use technology to  bargain with numerical strength, however if the ratio is over the equilibrium of balance or even worst our neighbours have both technology and numbers, there is no way Singapore can balance the strength, no way we can form a deterrent except to possess WMD. It is this reason why Israel and Pakistan goes nuclear, why Taiwan wants to join the club and why Japan is six months in any notice to have nuclear weapons.<br><br></div></blockquote>What do we need to balance 50 or 100 Astros? a nuke? if there are 10 batteries each with 5 Astros, and are deployed in 10 different areas, then you probably need 10 nukes!! It is easy to buy 100 Astros or equivalent MRLS, but it is not easy to build 10 nukes.<br><br>Alternatively, we can have 50 aircrafts armed with guided missiles, and accurate intelligence of where the 50 Astros are. If we take the initiative of first attack and wipe out the Astros, or at least keep them out of range, we are ok. I think this is feasible, and I believe there are more than one feasible alternatives. The number of planes and astros or any MLRS may be hypothetical, but the principle consideration is the same.<br><br>The only reason why you need a nuke or WMD to balance 50 Astros is to destroy as much what 50 Astros can destroy. But that is a lose lose situation. It is not a deterence, for Malaysia or Indonesia can afford more land and more population to be destroyed than we do.<br><br>The American have many ICBM but that does not help their troops in Iraq a bit, nor is that a deterence against  bombings on american soil. Has the Isrealis nuke prevented anything? no. Will China be deterred from attacking Taiwan if Taiwan had a nuke? no, i think China will attack first. Is India afraid of the nuke from Pakistan? I think now India will not hessitate to throw a few nukes to destroy Pakistan nukes first if war starts.<br><br>We should take note that nuke or any other facility producing WMD in singapore will become a primary target for terrorists, or commando attack even before war starts. A leak is enough.<br><br>Have we exhausted all alternatives before we conclude that it is a must to have a nuke? Then we have to decide to whom we should entrust the authority to use the nuke? who will be the last Singaporean? It is easy to decide on a first strike of 100 planes into enemy land than to decide on pushing the button.<br><br>When nuke is used, we know that God is not with us anymore. For the sake of all mankind, may nuke never be used.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote>It is easy to buy 100 Astros or equivalent MRLS, but it is not easy to build 10 nukes.</blockquote>U jolly know that we cant afford to operate 100 Astros in terms of manpower.<br><br><blockquote>Alternatively, we can have 50 aircrafts armed with guided missiles, and accurate intelligence of where the 50 Astros are. If we take the initiative of first attack and wipe out the Astros, or at least keep them out of range, we are ok. I think this is feasible, and I believe there are more than one feasible alternatives. The number of planes and astros or any MLRS may be hypothetical, but the principle consideration is the same.</blockquote>Do you see the threat of 50 Astros? Do you see that it is much easy for them to launch 40 Astros at us before all 50 Aircraft can be off in the sky? Do you see that the Astros are strategic weapons and our 50 Aircrafts are not and do you see that it is to our disadvantage?<br><br>As i had said many times, there is a limit for Singapore to match the race with conventional weapons, over that limit, Singapore have to go WMD style. That apply to Israel, Pakistan, Japan and Taiwan.<br><br><blockquote>But that is a lose lose situation. It is not a deterence, </blockquote>A lose lose situation is a deterence. Read MAD.<br><br><blockquote>for Malaysia or Indonesia can afford more land and more population to be destroyed than we do. </blockquote>You are damm sure that they are willing to lose 22 million people (for malaysia) for just 4 Million people?<br><br>I do not see why are they at an advantage in terms of population and land when we launch 10 nukes at them, destroying 10 of their cities. The cost for them is too large for them to pay.<br><br><blockquote>Has the Isrealis nuke prevented anything? no. Will China be deterred from attacking Taiwan if Taiwan had a nuke? no, i think China will attack first. Is India afraid of the nuke from Pakistan? I think now India will not hessitate to throw a few nukes to destroy Pakistan nukes first if war starts. </blockquote>You are bloody wrong. The Isrealis nuke had ever since detered conventional war on Israeli soil for many years, although war had been wage before when Israel went nuclear, the ME countries now see that attacking Israel will be damm costly with 500 Nuclear warheads in their hand. Do you see potential security challenge from Jordan , Egypt and Syria now? And why do you think Iran want to go nuclear?<br><br>Comeon, India will not hessitate to throw a few nukes as well as Pakistan as well as Russia to US in the Coldwar, as well North Korea currently. But it is because of a nuclear deterrence by someone, somewhere that prevent such shit to happen. If North Korea do not have a credible nuclear deterrent, US will think much less into going a war. Same goes to the other example<br><br>Please do not disregard the deterrent effect of a nuclear arsenal.<br><br><blockquote>We should take note that nuke or any other facility producing WMD in singapore will become a primary target for terrorists, or commando attack even before war starts. A leak is enough.</blockquote>Comon, Tengal Airbase had been for years a potential taget for terrorist and Commando attack. Remove it ok?<br><br><blockquote>When nuke is used, we know that God is not with us anymore. For the sake of all mankind, may nuke never be used.</blockquote>For all respect, it think this is native of you to think like that.</div>
