This is especially true regarding restricted information on military doctrine and equipment.<br><br>In addition to the usual SGforums Commandments, please abide by the following guidelines before posting<br><br>1) Please refrain from posting information about restricted doctrine and equipment which are not in public domain. If itÂ’s supposed to be classified, let it STAY classified!<br><br>2) Public domain information should be accompanied by the source of information. At the very least, references should ideally include the name of the publication as well as the date of the publication (Month/Year), or a link the full URL should it come from a website. And no, information from material restricted to MINDEF personnel doesnÂ’t count as public domain information!<br><br>3) Separate facts from rumours. If youÂ’ve been told about something your friendÂ’s brother girlfriendsÂ’ brother heard/saw, state it as such. In addition, if what youÂ’ve been told is supposed to be classified, rule (1) applies<br><br>4) Mobilisation Codes: These are considered Restricted Information. Please do not discuss these, particularly in the context of linking such codes to units/formations. Err on the side of caution, do not discuss them at all!<br><br>5) It is often tempting to tell everyone how much you know or about what you are. Or drop hints, clues and make innuendos to that effect, when youÂ’re not supposed to. DONÂ’T. You might be giving away more than you think!<br><br>The moderating team strives to maintain Military Nuts as a forum to discuss all things military including that of SingaporeÂ’s, without compromising SingaporeÂ’s national security at the same time. As such we will not hesitate to remove any thread or posting which contravenes these guidelines. However, that is, and always will be, a last resort, and weÂ’ll prefer posters to exercise their own discretion to us exercising it on their behalf.<br><br>We request your cooperation and understanding on this issue. Should you have any queries regarding these guidelines, please feel free to approach any of us via a Private Message. Thank you,<br><br>Viper52<br>For the Moderators of Military Nuts, SGforums<br><br></div>

After u had ur military experience, then u decide if u still want to lay ur life for singapore... ( Well on my part, and the rest of those who had, and those still serving, we remember our SAF pledge,  not forgetting our Specialists' and Officers' Creed....<br><br>You know how to cut and paste the guidelines for Military Nuts.... Thanks, i had read them before ur generosity...  Everyone have their freedom of speech and views, and you certainly have yours.. but please ask intelligent questions and not QS  that just tell people you-are-only-an-armchair-" expert"-without-any-reallife-military-experience.<br><br>Its easy to open your mouth and say this say that...  but are you aware of the implications it will bring...? and the economical,political ,practical implications ,feasibility of introducing certain defence equipment into the region...?? well asking MINDEF bring in the defence equipments you saw on internet, books, computer games is not as easy as asking daddy for $$ to buy the latest computer and games....<br>National Defence is more than reading stuff off the net, books, forum and asking ur govt to implement them, it is definitely more than keeping an invicible army on ur land<br>War is more than 2 ( or more) countries' army trying to see who can kill more of each other...<br><br>No worries dude... you do not have the qualities to piss off me... its just worrying to know that you will be playing a part in defending SINGAPORE...<br>*  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_eek.gif" alt="Shocked" title="Shocked"> OMG... better stock up on the weapon stockpiles at home, defend my own country myself...<br><br>Anyway.. its good to think positive abt serving ur time... but its bad,,, to ask ignorant Qs.... btw i did not mention anything abt you selling our STATE SECRETS and becoming a traitor, ( which probably u wouldn't have access to, ) who brought up that idea...? unless thats what ur intention is...?? ( PS things found off books, net and forum not considered state secrets ) Since you are NUTS abt defending Spore... WHY not  stop doing whatever you are doing now, and sign on right now... be a regular... JING ZHONG BAO GUO... i'm sure you BMT  PC, OC will be proud our you...<br><br>Lastly.. wait till you are part of the operations ( real life military , sorry computers games not included ) before you talk..... else... everything is just swipe off net, books, forum....</div>
