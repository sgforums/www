No army in the world (except maybe your Red Alert one) is dumb enough to tell the whole world what they have.  For obvious reasons I can't mention what, but for armour alone there are already several "things" that is not mentioned on MINDEF website nor shown at army open house.<br><br>You can tell ppl not to act smart, but you fail to realise you're the biggest smart aleck here.
