What's a few missles as compared to a few hundred artillery guns? They should be the one that's concerned at this imbalance to which they have every right to try and remedy.<br><br>Plus to go nuclear without a legitimate reason is amounting to being a rogue state. It will only be legit reason if we give them the excuse they need, just like India did for Pakistan and that incident almost brought about a nuclear war. </div></blockquote>Astros is a rocket system, it is not a missile. Typically a battery has 6 launchers and one fire control vehicle. Knock out the FC vehicle then the rest can only display fire works.<br><br>It is an artillery saturation rocket system, or MLRS (multiple launch rocket system), designed to give saturation fire power but it lacks the accuracy of a howitzer.  If you want any detailed analysis you have to ask the artillery guys.<br><br>The only concerns is its range. The version malaysian bought carries 4 rounds per launcher with a range of 60 - 80km. If we keep them north of Johore state then it will not threaten singapore.<br><br>What I am certain is that this is just another artillery!! it is not a strategic weapon and therefore does not tilt any strategic balance.<br><br>One apache with 16 hellfire can take out ONE complete Astros battery without any problem. That is what happened to the Iraqi Astros during the gulf war.<br><br>I won't worry too much about it.<br></div>

There is nothing i can do if you fail to see my point despite giving you examples of how smaller countries try to match up with a bigger country whom have everytime more capable to outfight her. It is also my point to bring forward that two nations with nuclear standoff capability having the capability to destroy each other, ceteris paribus have equal standing despite the difference in size and conventional numerical strength, however two nations with differences in size and con.numerical strength have different standing, this lead to instability.</div>

We are sticking to our howitzers.<br><br>quote:<br>---------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>Do you see the threat of 50 Astros? Do you see that it is much easy for them to launch 40 Astros at us before all 50 Aircraft can be off in the sky? Do you see that the Astros are strategic weapons and our 50 Aircrafts are not and do you see that it is to our disadvantage?<br>---------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br><br>What is strategic weapons to you?<br>Astros are vehicle-mount, need to be deployed, which then required them to move in convoy. There are not submarine launched or can launch directly from underground silo. If they have 50 batteries which means there are at least 50x15 vehicles excluding vehicles for personnels. The question is not is it easy to launch but are they anymore difficult to detect and destroy than any other artillery system? The answer is No. So there is no difference if Malaysia were to buy a hundred pieces of howitzer.<br><br>quote:<br>----------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>As i had said many times, there is a limit for Singapore to match the race with conventional weapons, over that limit, Singapore have to go WMD style. That apply to Israel, Pakistan, Japan and Taiwan.<br><br>-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br><br>The limit is not limited to the population and the land mass. The limits also include political, financial, personnels, training.....there are limits to us, there are limits to them as well. So what is the limit, over which Singapore will have to have nuclear weapon as deterrence?<br><br>quote:<br>-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br><br>You are damm sure that they are willing to lose 22 million people (for malaysia) for just 4 Million people?<br><br>I do not see why are they at an advantage in terms of population and land when we launch 10 nukes at them, destroying 10 of their cities. The cost for them is too large for them to pay.<br><br>-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br><br>The question is: are you going to risk 4 million singaporean, in order to destroy 22 millions malaysia? Put it another way, IF, SAF were defeated, will you launch nuke at them, knowing that they will retaliate with nuke, whether you will kill 22 million of them or not is not important, what is certain is the 4 million singaporean will perish!! Will you??<br><br>quote:<br>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br><br>You are bloody wrong. The Isrealis nuke had ever since detered conventional war on Israeli soil for many years, although war had been wage before when Israel went nuclear, the ME countries now see that attacking Israel will be damm costly with 500 Nuclear warheads in their hand. Do you see potential security challenge from Jordan , Egypt and Syria now? And why do you think Iran want to go nuclear?<br><br>Comeon, India will not hessitate to throw a few nukes as well as Pakistan as well as Russia to US in the Coldwar, as well North Korea currently. But it is because of a nuclear deterrence by someone, somewhere that prevent such ^^$&amp; to happen. If North Korea do not have a credible nuclear deterrent, US will think much less into going a war. Same goes to the other example<br><br>Please do not disregard the deterrent effect of a nuclear arsenal.<br><br>----------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br><br>No, the power balance has tilted in favour of Isreal who were supplied with more advance weapons, conventional ones; relatively speaking, the USSR who used to supply weapons to the Arab were going down hill and eventually disintegreted!! Since when has Jordan been any security challenge to Isreal? They lost the west bank to Isreal in the war in 67 and finally gave up the area in 88 to PLO. Egypt since signing the the Camp David Accord has not been hostile to Isreal. Syria's joining the Allied forces in 91 against Iraq was a clear demonstration of Syria's walking in line with the international community. I have no doubt Isreal is in possession of nuke, but further wars in the middle east were not averted by these nuke!! I doubt they have 500 warheads.<br><br>North Korea's nuclear arsenal is a threat to Japan and south korea and it is not a deterrence. Do you think US is afraid of the nuke from North Korea?<br><br>Nuclear weapons can be deterrence, but its importance has been reduced after the cold war. don't treat it like God.<br><br>quote:<br>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br><br>Comon, Tengal Airbase had been for years a potential taget for terrorist and Commando attack. Remove it ok?<br><br>---------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br><br>Every building, shopping center,... is a potential target for terrorists attack.  Why would commando want to attack airbase? blow up planes, control towers?? When a bomb rip up a building, ppl died from the blast of the bomb, or the falling debris. When a bomb damage a nuclear plant, ppl died from radiation. Make the comparison yourself.<br><br>quote:<br>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br><br>For all respect, it think this is native of you to think like that.<br><br>[/b][/quote]<br><br>don't know what you are talking about.<br><br></div>
