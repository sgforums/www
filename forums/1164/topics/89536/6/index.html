IDF was still flying Mirrage 111, the Kfir and Skyhawks. By 1973 when the war started, the arabs were equipped with the more superior MIG 23, SAM 6 and shoulder launched anti tank missiles, I think it was Sagger. These last two weapons took the Isrealis by surprise in the battle field.<br><br>IDF won the 6 day war because they launched a surprised attacked which destroyed the arab air forces on the ground.
