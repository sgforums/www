              <p>hmm, i didnt quite think of that. but i think the main threat is from "redland" subs tailing my subs and keeping track of them by sea.</p>
              <p>u cant hide the fact when a sub puts away to sea unless you have a covered sea shed that leads all the way out to the ocean.</p>
              <p>by locating the base upriver, you force an enemy sub tracking / waiting to stop entering the harbour area for fear of detection by hydrophone.</p>
              <p>so the enemy sub has to basically sit along the point where the scorpene is expected to enter the ocean. better if you had a wide area of coast to choose from rather than a limited choke point right ? but you're right, it works both ways.</p>

              <p>Prior to the Japanese attack on Singapore during WW2, it was reported that the Japanese had sent spies to the Johor side of the Straits of Johor and facing the Britsh naval base at the present Sembawang Shipyard, and the naval refuel depot that is next to the old Woodlands Immigration Checkpoint.</p>
              <p>The Japanese spies were pretending to be surveyors, nature photographers, and casual tourists - all keeping a trained eye on the specialised areas of interests, and sending reports back to their HQ.</p>

              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>China has secretly built an underground nuclear submarine base in the South China Sea, posing a new threat to powers in the region — a development the Pentagon says it has known about for at least two years.</strong></p>
              <p>Satellite photos of the base obtained by FOX News show a large harbor and massive tunnels that defense experts say could shelter many nuclear subs.</p>
              <p>The Defense Department has estimated that by 2010 China will have five operational 094-class nuclear submarines capable of carrying 12 nuclear missiles each, according to the Daily Telegraph.</p>
              <p>According to the Defense Department, China has 57 attack submarines, but these satellite pictures suggest their 094-class nuclear submarine may already be available.</p>
              <p>“It’s very significant to have further visual evidence of the kinds of military build-up that they’ve been engaged in for some time,” said Stephen Yates, a senior fellow at the American Foreign Policy Council.</p>
              <p>Photos of the base were taken on November 28 by DigitalGlobe’s QuickBird satellite, and first appeared in the military journal Jane’s Intelligence Review.</p>
              <p>The secret base, known as Sanya, is located on the southern tip of Hainan Island in the South China Sea. Defense experts say <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #3366ff;"><em>the harbor feeds into waters so deep that the submarines could launch without having to surface, making it difficult to detect them from the sky</em></span></span>.</p>

              <p>BTW - that photo showed a hole on the side of a hill or mountain, and the space from the opening to the water seems to have some kind of obstacle. I wonder if that is a fake opening to "resemble an entrance into a cave".</p>
              <p>The submarine will not need such an opening.</p>

              <p>Interesting.</p>
              <p>Perhaps that's their place for messes etc etc. It might even be for weapon storage....?</p>
