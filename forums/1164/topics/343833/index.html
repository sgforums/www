              <p>The following news piece was published two years ago, concerning the Malaysian efforts to build up the submarine unit.</p>
              <blockquote><span style="font-size: medium;"><strong></strong></span>
              <p><strong></strong></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: medium;">

              <hr>

              <p> </p>
              </span>
              <p><span>Naval base ready by 2009 <br>12 June, 2007 </span></p>
              <p> <strong>Kota Kinabalu</strong>: The nearly RM1 billion Sepanggar Bay naval base near here is expected to be fully-operational within two years, in time for the delivery of the country's first two Scorpene submarines.</p>
              <p>Speaking to reporters after getting a briefing on the development of the naval base in his first visit to the facility, Deputy Prime Minister Datuk Seri Najib Tun Razak said the implementation of the project was proceeding smoothly.</p>
              <p>He said the base was of strategic importance to the Royal Malaysian Navy and the Malaysian armed forces as it would be home to two submarines to be delivered shortly.</p>
              <p>"Yes, it will serve as the nerve centre for monitoring operations in the South China Sea and Sulu Sea," said Najib, who is Defence Minister.</p>
              <p>He said between 2,000 and 2,500 personnel would be stationed at the facility by 2009, and the figure would swell to more than 6,000 if their dependents were included.</p>
              <p>Najib said, to date, the Government had spent more than RM600 million on the project and RM300 million more was needed for its completion.</p>
              <p>The naval base would also benefit those in the surrounding areas as they could share, for example, sports facilities with navy personnel.</p>
              <p>"This will enable our people to forge close relations with those living in nearby areas," he said, adding that the presence of foreign vessels berthing at the base would also indirectly boost the economy of the surrounding area, especially the State capital.</p>
              <p>Meanwhile, he said the Government has approved special incentives of between RM600 and RM3,000 monthly for Royal Malaysian Navy (RMN) personnel in submarine service.</p>
              <p>Najib announced that the Submarine Service Incentive Payment would be backdated to Jan. 1, 2005.</p>
              <p>He said the incentive would be paid from the start of training and based on their qualifications and expertise.</p>
              <p>The RMN officers undergoing submarine training would receive RM800 while other ranks RM600 and having completed the training, the officers would receive RM1,400 while other ranks RM1,100.</p>
              <p>"When they reach the level of experts, their allowances will be raised to RM1,900 monthly for officers and RM1,500 for other ranks," he said, adding that the submarine commanding officer would receive RM3,000.</p>
              <p>Since 2005, 145 RMN personnel including 49 officers are being trained at the Ecole Formation de Sous Marine, Brest in France to enable them to operate submarines safely and effectively.</p>
              <p>Accompanying Najib were Chief Minister Datuk Seri Musa Aman, Army Chief, General Tan Sri Hj Abdul Aziz Zainal, Defence Ministry Secretary-General, Datuk Sri Ahmad Latffi Hashim, Navy Chief, Tan Sri Ramlan Mohamed Ali and Commander Naval Region Two (Sabah and Sarawak), Rear Admiral Datuk Ahmad Kamaruzaman as well as Karambunai Assemblywoman, Jainab Ahmad.</p>

              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>THE country's second Scorpene submarine was named and launched by the Raja Permaisuri Agong Tuanku Nur Zahirah yesterday morning at a ceremony witnessed by Yang di-Pertuan Agong Tuanku Mizan Zainal Abidin at the Navantia Naval shipyard. </strong></p>
              <p>KD ‘Tun Razak’, Malaysia second submarine, moored at the Navantia Naval shipyard in Spain after being launched by Raja Permaisuri Agong Tuanku Nur Zahirah yesterday.</p>
              <p>Deputy Defence Minister Datuk Wira Abu Seman Yusop, armed forces chief Gen Tan Sri Abdul Aziz Zainal, navy officials and shipyard workers were among those who gathered to celebrate the launching of the 67.5-metre diesel-powered submarine, KD Tun Razak.<br><br>It will be manned by a crew of 31.<br><br>The KD Tun Razak, like the country's first submarine, KD Tunku Abdul Rahman, was built by DCNS of France and Navantia of Spain.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Tuanku Nur Zahirah performed the customary launch ritual of breaking a bottle on the bow of the vessel.<br><br>The crack of the bottle on the bow was greeted with applause and navy personnel saluted the occasion by singing the Royal Malaysian Navy (RMN) anthem, Samudera Raya.<br><br>The crew of the KD Tun Razak celebrated their arrival by sounding the submarine's foghorn and in keeping with naval tradition, other ships in the dockyard reciprocated the launch of a new naval vessel.<br><br>Tuanku Mizan and Tuanku Nur Zahirah were then invited by navy chief Datuk Abdul Aziz Jaafar to inspect the KD Tun Razak, which will enter service in March, 2010.<br><br>In his speech, Abu Seman said the Scorpene submarines would strengthen the RMN's capability in undertaking the many challenging tasks facing it.<br><br>He said it would not only protect the country's shores but also the underwater assets.<br><br>"Malaysia is essentially a maritime nation. Given its geographical setting, it is inevitable that Malaysia's national interest and security concerns are closely related and associated with the sea."<br><br>He said the country's maritime area was about twice its land mass area.<br><br>"Within this span of water lies rich maritime resources and minerals that increasingly contribute to the country's economy."<br><br>He pointed out that more than 90 per cent of the country's domestic and international trade was dependent on sea transportation.<br><br>"On the seabed lies underwater piping that transport our oil and gas ashore, as well as cables that link major international communication networks," he said.<br><br>He said the submarine was named after the country's second prime minister, Tun Abdul Razak Hussein, in recognition of his contribution to the country.<br><br>The first submarine, KD Tunku Abdul Rahman, is named after Malaysia's first prime minister.<br><br>Both submarines can undertake a wide range of missions, including naval blockades, information-gathering and landing or retrieval of commandos.<br><br>They can operate alone or in combination with air and sea forces. <br><br>The new generation diesel-powered Scorpene has been hailed as a benchmark in the world conventional submarine market.<br><br>It is capable of operating in coastal waters and the high seas. It is armed with wire-guided torpedoes and Exocet SM39 sub-launched, anti-surface-ship missiles.<br><br>Malaysia is the second customer for the vessel after Chile, while India is acquiring it under a slightly different deal since it is building it in its own dockyard under licence.<br><br>Both submarines will be based at the naval base in Kota Kinabalu, Sabah.<br><br>The Scorpenes can operate at depths of 350m for 40 days, making them suitable for deployment in the South China Sea and the Straits of Malacca.</p>

              <p>the sub base location in sepanggar seems to indicate that malaysia has a keen eye on staking and enforcing its claim over the spratlys.</p>
              <p>interestingly enough, this probably means that the scorpenes are likely to be deployed in ocean / deep water operations rather than the crowded littoral waters of the Malacca/singapore strait.</p>
              <p>seems pretty easy to defend too, with several inlet areas that are easily defensible with a submersible hydrophone system</p>

This contract was awarded as a Small Business Innovative Research (SBIR) program, Phase 3 follow-on contract, under the authority of 10 U.S.C. 2301-c-5. The Space and Naval Warfare Systems Center in San Diego, CA issued the contract (N66001-07-C-0146).</p>

              <p>The Soviets do. The SS-N-14 is the Soviet equivalent of the ASROC. There is one variant that carries a 2 KT depth charge, and another variant that carries a torpedo with active guidance. Targeting information shouldn't be a problem really, beyond keying the right coordinates to the missile.</p>
              <p>SSKs are in general mobile minefields since they lack the endurance to chase ships with gas turbines.</p>

              <h2>A jewel of high technology</h2>
              <p>The
                  Scorpène, the most recent addition to DCNS’s range of conventional
                  ocean-going submarines, has already won over the Chilean, Malaysian and
                  Indian navies. There is nothing surprising about this choice when you
                  consider its key advantages. It is capable of carrying out all types of
                  mission imaginable for a submarine; it can hunt down other submarines,
                  deliver commandoes to their destination or launch strikes from deep
                  under the sea. Equipped to order with the MESMA air-independent
                  propulsion system, it can remain submerged for periods in excess of 3
                  weeks.</p>
              <p>Other key advantages distinguish the Scorpène-class
                  submarine from the competitors: its high degree of security and
                  reliability, its efficient combat system that allows it to compile
                  information from all types of sensors and to use all types of weapons,
                  its ability to communicate when submerged, its smaller crew
                  requirements, etc.</p>
              <p><img src="http://www.dcnsgroup.com/photo/capacite/scorpene_caracteristique.jpg" alt="" width="240" height="147"></p>
              <p>The Scorpène heralds in the dawn of a new era for “conventional”
                  deterrence. Its superiority resides in part in its acoustic advantage
                  resulting from the combination of extreme acoustic discretion with a
                  high-speed submarine detection capacity thanks to its unparalleled
                  sonar suite.</p>

              <h1>DCNS delivers Royal Malaysian Navy’s very first submarine</h1>
              <p><strong> Today, DCNS delivered the Royal Malaysian Navy’s first-ever submarine.
                  This on-time delivery follows Malaysia’s decision to set up a submarine
                  force comprising two Scorpene-type conventional-propulsion boats.</strong></p>
              <p><strong>The
                  Royal Malaysian Navy took formal delivery of Scorpene submarine KD
                  Tunku Abdul Rahman at today’s official handover in Toulon. The guests
                  of honour included RMN Chief of Staff Admiral Dato’Sri Aziz Hj Jaafar.<br><br></strong>KD
                  Tunku Abdul Rahman is the first of two Scorpene submarines ordered by
                  Malaysia in June 2002 and developed jointly by DCNS and Spanish naval
                  shipbuilder Navantia. In addition to the submarines proper, the
                  contract calls for associated logistics and training.<br><br>This major
                  milestone for the RMN follows the completion, in late December 2008, of
                  KD Tunku Abdul Rahman’s final sea trials demonstrating remarkable
                  operational and combat system capabilities. These trials included
                  successful firings of Black Shark heavyweight torpedoes and missiles.<br><br>KD
                  Tunku Abdul Rahman is scheduled to arrive in Malaysia early in the
                  second half of 2009. The second of the series, KD Tun Razak, is
                  scheduled for delivery in late 2009. Manned by Malaysian crews of just
                  31, the boats of<span style="color: #ff0000;">fer an endurance of 45 </span>days for a displacement of 1,550
                  tonnes and a length overall of 67.5 metres.<br><br>Scorpene represents
                  the state of the art in submarine design and construction and benefits
                  from the latest technologies developed for nuclear-powered classes
                  operated by the French Navy, particularly as regards acoustic
                  discretion and combat system</p>
              <p>performance. Excellent endurance makes the Scorpene one of the few
                  medium-displacement designs suitable for extended ocean patrol duties.
                  The modular design can also be readily tailored to each customer’s
                  specific mission profiles and other requirements.<br><br>This programme
                  confirms DCNS’s know-how as a leading prime contractor for
                  sophisticated warship programmes. With ten units ordered to date (two
                  for Chile, two for Malaysia and six for India), Scorpene is truly an
                  international benchmark in SSK design.</p>

              <p>Yeah, the Scorpenes are indeed formidable.  But thanks to local waters and the traffic in it,I think the playing field gets leveled.  </p>
              <p>Like our Challengers, the Scorpenes will hunt surfaces targets.  From what I hear, its really not easy to track any diesel AIP boats here, hence sub-hunting-subs should be quite rare.</p>
