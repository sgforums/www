            <div class='col-md body'>One of the more handy distinctions I have come across is the distinction made between Special Forces and Special Operating Forces by Robin Neillands.  Neillands was in 45 Commando in the 1950's, and has written a number of books about Special Forces units since retiring.<br><br>In Neillands' definition, Special Forces covers units such as SEALs, Green Berets and the SAS and SBS.  Their tasks include intelligence gathering, small scale raids, training indigenous resistance movements and counter-terrorist operations.  Special Operating Forces, on the other hand, are large enough to handle conventional infantry warfare, and are more defined by a specific task, such as amphibious warfare for the US Marines, or airborne operations for the Parachute Regiment or our Commandos.<br><br>From experience, I cannot really agree with LaserLordz's theory.  There were many members of my company who would have happily volunteered to be there, only to find out that life in the Commandos was not what they expected it to be - those were the ones who were the least motivated.  On the other hand, there were others who were enlisted, went through the training and found that it grew on them - some of these became Best Trainee at the various phases of training.  The leadership and environment provided by the officers and senior NCOs also had a marked effect.  One of my OCs, when he first came aboard, addressed the company and said, "Despite being NSF, you are meant to be as professional as any regulars in the rest of the army.  I will treat you as professionals and in turn I expect you to act like professionals.".  This OC was in fact rotated to us from SOF simply to do his OC tour.  Everybody kept their end of the bargain, and things ran fine with a small handful of exceptions.<br><br>One of these was with a fellow who came over from Infantry by his own request.  He had some grandiose ideas that it would be a big gung-ho adventure, and when he found that the emphasis was instead on professionalism, he lost interest.  What ended up happening was that he spent the rest of his six-year contract getting his arse kicked by all and sundry for his poor attitude, and left as soon as his contract was up.<br></div>

Btw, what is to be understood by professionalism in this context? Does it mean that the level of regimentation is just as high as other units?<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>No, our definition of professionalism was quite distinct from regimentation.  By definition, regimentation is discipline imposed through a hierarchical structure.  Because our structure is flatter than those of most units, our culture tends more to focus more upon the individual, that discipline was more self-imposed.  Each of us was given more responsibility for our own performance - for most part we lived up to that responsibility, and the unit culture placed pressure on us to keep up with the rest.  We do tend to be more self-driven on average, in terms of things like fitness and weapon maintenance.<br><br>Our perceived level of discipline is affected by two factors, namely the flatter organisational structure and our order of priorities.  Within any operational company, the lowest rank is corporal, so there is much less difference in rank within the hierarchy.  Also, our officers return to us once they are commissioned, so we serve our last year under platoon commanders who went through BMT with us.  All of this leads to a much more casual environment amongst the ranks.<br><br>Our order of priorities also drives much of our conduct. While we pay little regard to the spit-and-polish aspects of military life, we do not muck about when it comes to making sure that we can get the job done.  When preparing for exercises, we would go through 20 to 25 dry runs, taking out different elements of the company each time (for example, the whole demolition team may get Â“killedÂ” and taken out of play) and executing all of the backup plans.<br><br>At the same time, when we switch off, we really switch off.   We once had a company barbecue at Big Splash - at one point, the whole company lined up at the biggest slide and the CSM dispatched everybody down the slide like it was an airborne drop, so that we had three or four guys on one slide at a time.  The lifeguard hit the panic button and called a halt to that immediately Â– spoilsport.  If you have a unit whose raison dÂ’etre is to cause disruption, what else can you expect?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by IAF:</div><div class="quote_body">Don't know about now, but i read about a survey conducted some time back in Israel that young men once they enter NS, are allowed to choose, before they do their bmt, the vocation they want.<br><br>The most popular choice being a fighter pilot in the air force, followed by the special forces especially the naval commandos - definitely not what their dear jewish mums would want! Guess the special forces there have a long and celebrated tradition to inspire such gungho-ness among the male youths.<br><br></div></blockquote>Israel is different. Israel has a long long history of being a nation of warriors always fighting and fighting for survival. The people therefore want to continue family traditions ... israeli's are much like the gurkas who also like to continue family traditions of soldiering.<br><br>Having said that I feel we should setup a recruiting station in Nepal like the british to recruit gurkas. A foreign legion force made up of gurkas.<br><br>Why british so powerful? It's because whenever there is a conflict they always send in the gurkas first. You notice the iraq invasion they never send in their own nationals.<br><br>Unlike the british I feel we should offer gurka recruits an opportunity for citizenship in singapore after serving a number of years. Train, educate, promote and grant citrizen ship. With citizen ship comes better life than scratching for a living in the fields back home. Eventually families will be brought over to continue the tradition of soldiering here in singapore. This will in time solve the low birth rate and greying problem.<br><br>Think of it as foreign talent in the armed forces. This is better than trying to get other money grabbing greedy FT nationals to settle here.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>That's not a bad theory.  However, bear in mind that most Ghurkas return to their families (direct and extended) in Nepal after completing their service.  Their ties to the land are pretty strong, so I would not put too much stock in the attraction of an offered citizenship.</div>
