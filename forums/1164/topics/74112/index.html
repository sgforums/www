But he's waiting for another</strong><br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">By Alvin Chiang </span><br><br>All i want is her death certificate<br><br>A letter offering his daughter a chance to go to university is just a waste of paper to Mr Chua Chun. The only certificate Mr Chua wants is his daughter's death certificate.<br><br>Second Sergeant Chua Bee Lin was lost at sea after the RSS Courageous collided with the container carrier ANL Indonesia off Pedra Branca in January last year. But to date, there is nothing to certify her death. With her death cert, Mr Chua, 52, will be able to unlock his daughter's savings.<br><br>And life will be easier for him and his family.<br><br>Meanwhile, a letter from the Singapore Institute of Management (SIM) was sent to Mr Chua's house last September. SIM sent the letter to inform Second Sgt Chua that she could make an application to study at the university.<br><br>But the lost chance for a degree in the family is the last thing on Mr Chua's mind.<br><br>For more than a year, he has been waiting for her death certificate.<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">MAY HAVE TO WAIT 7 YEARS </span><br><br>But he might have to wait for as long as seven years before he sees it.<br><br>This is because his daughter's body could not be found.<br><br>As such, Second Sgt Chua is technically not dead yet, but missing.<br><br>With no document to certify her death, Mr Chua cannot receive compensation for his daughter's accident for up to seven years, the time required for the law to recognise a missing person as dead.<br><br>Without the death certificate, Mr Chua cannot have access to his daughter's savings, which had been frozen since last year. Most importantly, receiving the document would give his family a sense of closure to a tragic chapter in their lives, more than the court verdict yesterday.<br><br>Mr Chua said in Mandarin: 'If she's alive, she would be back home already. It's been more than a year.<br><br>'The verdict has no impact on me since my daughter is already gone.<br><br>'It won't bring my daughter back.'<br><br>Before the incident, Second Sgt Chua played an important role in her family of four.<br><br>She was the main breadwinner in her family.<br><br>Second Sgt Chua earned more than $2,500 a month, her father said.<br><br>Mr Chua used to help out at a vegetable stall at a market near their Boon Lay flat.<br><br>He earned about $1,000 a month.<br><br>But in January this year, Mr Chua lost his job.<br><br>Madam Sow Kum Chot, 47, used to be a housewife when she lost her daughter, but now she does odd jobs to support the family and earns about $500 a month.<br><br>Mr Chua Wei Ming, Second Sgt Chua's younger brother, is a dispatch rider.<br><br>The elder Mr Chua said his 24-year-old son earns 'enough to support himself' without revealing exactly how much.<br><br>It has not been easy on the Chuas since the incident.<br><br>Second Sgt Chua was 24 years old at that time.<br><br>Mr Chua said: 'Our lives had not been good since then.<br><br>'Why? One person is gone from our family of four.<br><br>'It's not the same any more.<br><br>'We depended on her earnings to support the family.<br><br>'But now she's gone.'<br><br>The Chuas bought their four-room Boon Lay flat about three years ago.<br><br>For the next 28 years, they have to pay between $300 and $400 a month to complete repayment for the flat.<br><br>Mr Chua said his daughter was a quiet girl.<br><br>'She loved to read and study,' he said.<br><br>She seldom went out and preferred to stay at home.<br><br>Second Sgt Chua was a Singapore Polytechnic graduate.<br><br>She signed on with the Navy to get a tuition grant to support her studies, Mr Chua said.<br><br>He said his daughter dreamt of going to the university to further her studies.<br><br>He misses his daughter.<br><br>'How can I not think of her?<br><br>'She's my daughter and I raised her.'<br><br>Second Sgt Chua had registered her marriage to Mr Ng Chin Leong, 29, in 2001.<br><br>But they had not gone through the traditional Chinese wedding.<br><br>So Second Sgt Chua was still living at her parents' flat before the incident.<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">FAMILY TENSION </span><br><br>Now there appears to be some tension in the family.<br><br>Mr Chua was not happy that some had said Second Sgt Chua's funeral need not be elaborate.<br><br>Also, Mr Chua said he had been criticised by others for being slow in settling the problem of his daughter's death certificate.<br><br>As she was legally wed, there is also a dispute about how the compensation for her death should be shared.<br><br>Most of Second Sgt Chua's personal belongings were donated to charity, Mr Chua said.<br><br>'She loved dolls.<br><br>'But we decided to give them away to poor children in Thailand and Myanmar.'<br><br>The Chuas had also locked up Second Sgt Chua's room.<br><br>Perhaps it was their way of locking away memories of her.<br><br>Now, only a few personal items remain.</div>

She was lost at sea in a collision, all her bunkmates are dead. This, and everything else make it a special case. No one is saying the RSN should bend the rules, but the RSN should submit all relevant declassified documents to SIR(?) on the incident and the ensuing search for her in the seas around the accident site, and the sunken section of the Courageous.<br><br>The monies may be temporary relief, but it is relief nonetheless. And not to mention, it will bring about a closure for her family.<br><br>It is a disgace as the relevant authorities refuse to look into the circumstances of this case and use the law as an excuse for blaket treatment.

But although I haven't researched this area of the law, it should be entirely possible for the family to apply to a court for a special dispensation or waiver of the 7 year rule, due to the highly unusual circumstances of this particular case.<br><br>The law is not, and should never be treated as a rigid, inflexible construct beyond the pale of simple human compassion - the law, at the end of the day, is used to govern people, and as such must be (and, in civilised parts of the world, is) open to being influenced by principles that people hold dear, such as compassion, fairness and justice in individual cases. Every person coming before the law should be entitled to have his / her case decided on its merits (i.e. it should be done on a case by case basis), rather than have a blanket rule blindly and unthinkingly imposed on him / her.<br><br>I don't think that MINDEF and RSN legal services are doing their job properly. In the case of a bereavement, they should be working with the family to ensure that it is not subject to unjustified suffering as a result of the serviceman's / servicewoman's death. It should have visited the family, interviewed them, found out what effect the sailor's death would have on the family's livelihood, then done its best to put the family in the best legal position possible.<br><br>But maybe they can't be bothered. That's often how people in Singapore are deprived of their legal rights, because the non-English educated among them can't find their way around an English-based legal system (and they cannot be blamed for this), and because the system and institutions that should be helping them just can't be bothered to equip them with the right information and advice. That's why, in Singapore, justice is a right of only those who can afford to pay for it.</div>

As I've stated in my very first place, I've understood why the law is there, and fully agree with it.<br><br>My point, and it has not been addressed by either you, or Tripwire, is that in this case, it is almost certain beyond the whisker of a doubt, that 2SG Chua is deceased, and with the substantial evidence at hand (all crewmates who were in the same bunk had died, exhaustive search of the area of collision etc), the navy should make at least an effort to use this evidence as proof that there is little, if any reasonable doubt of 2SG Chuas deceased status and convince the Registrar of Births and Deaths, that a death certificate is in order. What I've been calling for, is a little flexbility on the application of the law. Not for anyone to break or bend it.<br><br>As I've said, it's not just about the money. Its about bringing closure to this episode to the family, and allowing them to 'move on' from this issue, like the RSN and the other families have.<br><br>Like I've asked, can we truly move on, when someone (the family) has been left behind?</div>

I'm suggesting a little bit of flexibility is required in this case. Theres nothing disgraceful about this law. But as I've stated before, hiding behind a law as a blanket judgement of all cases, without considering the merits of each case (such as this), is simply wrong, irresponsible, brain-dead and downright lazy. And because of this, 2SG Chua's family has to suffer while the RSN conveniently 'moves on'.<br><br>As for setting a "bad precedent", whats so bad about having a system which is flexible and nimble enough to take into account the unique merits of certain cases, and not exercise blanket judgements just because "the law said so"?<br><br>You and gary1910 have totally misrepresented my point of view, while refusing to respond to my point about calling for a little human flexibility in the application of the said law.</div>
