            <div class='col-md body'>If a scenario like this were to occur, in fact the US CBGs can be a big diversion from other allies which can knock out vital installations inside mainland China while she is focusing her top-end weaponry on the CBGs off her coastline.I wouldn't bet on US getting involved with China alone...Anyway, I think China wouldn't underestimate a CBG.Furthermore, in the event of a war, it's best hoped that cooler heads will prevail and not a single WMD is used by either side, for their response would be disastrous.<br><br>Here's just a brief look on a typical CBG.Note that China might be able to overpower the SPY-1 radar by saturation bombardment but that still leave them open to the air squadrons that will be in the air before the first PLA missile is inbound.These are just my views..Anyone care to comment?<br><br>-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br><br>Navy<br><br>Nimitz Carrier Battle Group<br>7,325 sailors<br>Ships:<br>Â•<strong> Nimitz<br>Nimitz-class aircraft carrier (CVN 6<img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"></strong><br>3,200 sailors<br><br>Â• <strong>Chosin<br>Ticonderoga-class guided missile cruiser (CG 65)</strong><br>385 sailors<br><br>Â• <strong>Princeton<br>Ticonderoga-class guided missile cruiser (CG 59)</strong><br>385 sailors<br><br>Â• <strong>Fitzgerald<br>Arleigh Burke-class guided missile destroyer (DDG 62)</strong><br>346 sailors<br><br>Â• <strong>Rodney M.

(though that needs some agreement with other counries to enter their airspace)<br>hmm i forgot the airforce too...<br><br>prob some special forces can go in through the borders overland, or sent in by submarines? how porous their borders are though? no idea abt that too...<br><br>prob not an amphibous landing wif the marines till late in the war<br><br>but then again, prob no war with the chinese will break out... hopefully not, too much of economy is at stake, the world is pretty much dead if 2 of the largest economies spent itself warring... we'll be better off back in the stone age by the time they're done...<br><br></div>
