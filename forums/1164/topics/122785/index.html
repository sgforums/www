            <div class='col-md body'>I agree that the life of the mechanics are tough. This is because as a tankie we are trained to be mechanic as well just that we learn less things. I can understand why they are not happy as they will have a feeling that they are "clearing the s**t" for the people who spoil the vehicle. It is after all not their fault that the vehicle are spolit. So I think we have to give them due credit even though they don't chiong in the field.<br><br>I wish to highlight the plight for fellow tankies here. As all of us know the SM1 is a very old machine. The original design dates from straight after WW2. We bought our tanks 2nd hand from other countries. Yes, even though it have been upgraded before it is still very old. Old things spoil easily. And if it is spolit in the field we have to remedied it ourselves (try fixing a throw track with 3 men!). The crew of a SM1 tank is only 3 as compared to the crew of a M113(7 men section +veh comdr + driver). I am <strong>not</strong> very sure on the actual number of people in the M113 but it is obvious that there is significantly more people allocated to each vehicle. Yes,I agree that we don't need to chiong and only provide cover when the troopers chiong to the objective during exercises. However, we spent significantly more time doing servicing per veh crew while back in camp. Singapore is one of the only few countries in the world which still operates the AMX-13 tanks. This means that the supply of spare parts are low,which in turn cause the signing of 1206 extra painful as the spare parts are very expensive(imagine shared by only 3 men!).<br><br>To be fair to our fellow AI troopers, I am not trying to compare whose job is more shiong here. Like I have said before, I am just letting the others know and try to understand the problems which the tankies have. Therefore I am looking forward to training in the new platform which replaces the SM1 during my ICT! <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"> <strong></strong></div>
