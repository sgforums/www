            <div class='col-md body'>Interesting scenario.Let's put things into perspective here...<br><br>If we take the cream of ASEAN's air forces,e.g RSAF F-16C/Ds Block 52(Israeli mods), RMAF's MIG-29Ks, F/A-18E/Fs, RTAF's F-16A/Bs, and their respective naval platforms, e.g RSN's Delta-class frigates, RMN's Lekiu-class frigates.We may be able to sting back, but only if we have a comprehensive and coherent logisitical backbone that can really integrate our armed forces into a networked force.If you include Australia into the picture, things might change a little, becuase of the entrance of the Collins-clas subs , which are one of the deadliest diesel electric subs this side of the world currently...Many people fail to realise that the Straits of Malacca is a trap for any bluewater navy when faced with a littoral force that has been operating here for decades.</div>
