People who have information but are unable to analyse and draw sensible conclusion can talk nonsense; those who know but cannot differentiate the difference between right or wrong may also talk nonsense; those who think knowing a lot will not talk nonsense is talking nonsense (how much is a lot); those whose ideas you disagree may also be deemed to speak nonsense (by you);.....open your mind and accept different opinion!!</div>
