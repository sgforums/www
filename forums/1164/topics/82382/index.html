            <div class='col-md body'>i wouldn't recommend the cheaper sticks. they spoil really easily. i've gone through two cheap microsoft or logitech sticks already. what i would suggest is, if you wanna have the best stick, get the cougar from thrustmaster. that one's like 500 or 600 bucks, but its what the USAF uses to train its pilots. if you don't wanna pay that much, cos you think its crazy, then follow me and get a saitek x45. it comes with a stick and seperate throttle, can do all the functions of the cougar, and retails at simlim at about $140-160. the particular wireless stick you're talking about, i've tried it out before at a friend's place. i wouldn't recommend it because its way too flimsey and doesn't provide good tension on its axis;a typical gamer's stick. if you wanna fly on sim, don't bother with sticks without a seperate throttle. those are for games, not sims. you'll never learn to fly properly if you use those.<br><br>its true that the better stick got better feel, but you cannot compare something like a sidewinder to a cougar or x45. the quality difference and feel is totally different, and suffice to say, the x45 and cougar have a bloody solid feel to them. cheap sticks will not center well, and it'll leave a calibration nightmare, and it will be very hard to do straight level hand flying, simply because the cheaper sticks have no defined center. oh, and i would like to correct the above poster on something. men was never born to fly. if we were, we would have wings. everyone can learn to fly. its only how good we all end up. it would then be unfair to say that if cannot fly, a 200buck stick also no use, because everyone can learn, and a 200buck stick will definatly do a better job than cheap $35 stick.</div>

I just want to make sure that I buy one that is game-worthy and I believe that this forum has many flt sim gamers.<br><br>Thanks, I'll check out the site, but is it available in Singapore?</div>
