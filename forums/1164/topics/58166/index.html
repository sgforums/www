            <div class='col-md body'>I was caught by police today when i flew my micro electric helicopter in the neighbourhood amphitheatre. i know this topic is not related to military nuts but i would like to get your opinions on this. i was flying in the area when i landed to wait for wind to die down and for a woman to walk past. when i took off again, someone suddenly ran up behind me and stood next to my chopper. in order not to crash into him, i needed time to manouvere it away from him. turns out he was a police officer. i got a tongue lashing by him. he said that i was flying dangerously when i din't stop even though he was standing there. %$$&amp;*. he stand there how to immediatly stop. now i got a police record and a town council complaint against me. so unlucky.</div>
