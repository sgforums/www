A rounded nose sleeve was placed on the leading end of a tube in order to push the tube through obstacles. The torpedo was set off by placing a blasting cap in the recessed end cap well and igniting it with a time-delayed (electric or non-electric) fuse.<br><br>The Bangalore torpedo is still employed today by the United States Army. A modern M1A2 Bangalore torpedo kit contains 10 five-foot torpedo sections, 10 five-inch connecting sleeves, and 1 nose sleeve.<br><br>Tube Length: 5' Tube<br>Diameter: 2 1/8"<br>Tube Wall: 24 gauge<br>Weight: 13 lbs. (9 pounds of explosives)<br>Explosive Type: TNT<br>Connecting Sleeve: 5" Nose Sleeve: 3 3/4"[/img]</div>

The excercise was beach defence and my company was the enemy force, which meant no trench digging - HOORAY!!!!<br><br>We were stationed on Seletar Island and were to use assault boats to simulate an attack from our neighbours. (Apparently our neighbours only have one company of soldiers and a few motorised sampans.)<br><br>Some big shot was watching the excercise so no expense was spared.<br><br>A few rusty lead pipes with peeling blue paint was handed out to a section of us enemy types.<br><br>These lengths of pipes didn't impress any of us and we were at first wondering if our job was to disguise ourselves as plumbers. (Our neighbours are a devious lot, I always say.)<br><br>But this was not to be and we duly boarded assault boats with these pipes. While we were still wondering what kind of medieval weapons these lengths of pipes are it was explained that they are called "bungalow torpedoes".<br><br>At this time "Saving Private Ryan" hasn't shown yet and we laughed out loud at a bomb named after a type of house. But it was explained these objects were not for demolishing homes of rich people but to blow up barbed wire on the beach.<br><br>You learn something useful everyday as a rifleman.</div>
