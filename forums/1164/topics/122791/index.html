            <div class='col-md body'>The following is an interesting summary of the origin of the 36 strategems, courtesy of HBN from WAFF, enjoy. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><blockquote>PREFACE<br><br>"Of the thirty-six strategies, running away is the best choice." This is a familiar remark, in literary works as well as in real life, from people who want to get around a situation that they are unable to cope with for the moment. The expression first appeared in the official History of Southern Qi about fifteen hundred years ago. Since then, it gained increasing currency until an anonymous scholar (estimated a contemporary of late Ming or early Qing) laid out the entire thirty-six strategies in a small book called Secret Art of War: Thirty-Six Strategies. At first it circulated only in hand-written copies and did not find its way into any bibliography of military writing. First printed in 1941 by the Xinghua Printing House in Chengdu, it did not attract general attention until after the founding of the People's Republic of China.<br><br>Apart from a preface and an afterword, the book falls conveniently into thirty-six sections, each consisting of the title, text, and comment of a strategy. The title invariably takes the form of a four-character idiom, which sometimes refers directly to a renowned battle in history. All the idioms have been in wide use among both the elite classes and the common people for at least hundreds of years; most have taken on diverse military imports. Therefore the title itself can elicit plentiful reminiscences in an average Chinese reader, who may interpret the ensuing text according to his or her own military know- ledge or experience. In fact, the text of each strategy, consisting of less than a dozen characters, is so condensed that one has to read one's own thoughts into it. More often than not, the text contains a quotation from the most revered classic of China, I Ching (Book of Changes). This is followed by a relatively lengthy comment, which explicate the text and cites one or two ancient battles to illustrate the application of the strategy.<br><br>The present book offers a precise translation of the title and text of each strategy. A purport, based mainly on the original comment but also incorporating ideas from other sources, then expounds the common usage of the titular idiom and its military connotations. This is sometimes followed by quotations from various ancient military works to further exemplify the strategy. The account of a historical battle or campaign featuring the successful application of the strategy makes up the final part of each section. All the stories are adapted mainly from official history records but may also draw upon miscellaneous writings of credit.<br><br>According to a recent incomplete survey, more than twenty-three hundred titles of military writing from ancient China have survived. About fifty of them are well known and still enjoy a broad readership among military leaders. They cover all aspects of ancient warfare: strategy and tactics, natural conditions in relation to war, manufacture and usage of weapons and gears, organisation and discipline of the armed forces, tactical formations, frontier defence, training of professional troops, and military history.<br><br>All the above subjects appeal to researchers in the history of ancient Chinese warfare, but those who look for ancient theories applicable in modern warfare generally prefer the books on strategy and tactics. In those works, one finds brilliant expositions on problems faced by military leaders of all times and cannot but marvel at the depth and scope attained by the ancient masters.<br><br>Though its technical side has undergone remarkable progress toward greater complexity and more dimensions, war as an art has certain fundamental truths that remain valid all through the ages. For instance, war is a political organ to achieve goals that cannot be brought about by peaceful means. A military leader builds up and maintains his strength and weakens that of his opponent, conceals his intentions and capabilities and endeavours to detect those of his opponent, avoids battle at his disadvantage and manoeuvres to achieve superiority at the focal points where he chooses to give battle. Modern technology has greatly transformed warfare, but generals and even line officers today often face the same problems that confronted their ancient counterparts. After all, war is launched, conducted, and terminated by humans; there- fore it conforms to certain intrinsic laws that are a projection of human nature. As long as human nature does not change, war as a human activity will follow some ageless rules in the course of time.<br><br>Secret Art of War: Thirty-Six Strategies was composed in conformity to the yin-yang doctrine formulated in I Ching. Six, the primal yin number, denotes secret ruses in military contexts, and six square means a whole bag of tricks. The summary of various strategies in terms of the yin-yang antithesis makes possible a simplistic treatment of the complex subject matter. Yin and yang represent an endless series of opposites in the universe; in warfare they are mainly embodied in the pair of xu (cowardice, weakness, disorder, hunger, fatigue, numerical inferiority, unpreparedness) and shi (bravery, strength, order, full stomach, leisure, numerical superiority, preparedness). Thus in Li Jing's Reply to Emperor Taizong of Tang (Tang Tai Zong Li Jing Wen Dui), the emperor observes, "In my opinion, the various military works contain nothing other than Sun Zi's Art of War, and the Art of War contains nothing other than xu and shi." Another familiar twosome is qi (extraordinary) and zheng (normal), whose relationship has been clarified in Sun Zi's well-known maxim, "Engage the enemy by your normal force and defeat it by your extraordinary forces."<br><br>Naturally, the transformation of modern warfare by technological innovations calls for a re-examination of the ancient rules. In fact, since ancient times the rules have always been flexible. They are not really rules but modes of thinking and call for the combination of common sense and extraordinary ruses, with which the military leader adjusts his decisions to the ever-changing situation in war. In this sense, the thirty-six strategies are thirty-six basic ideas distilled from military experiences in ancient Chinese warfare. Therefore they may serve to promote and activate rather than restrain military planning and decision-making today.</blockquote></div>
