            <div class='col-md body'>S'poreans on dive trip detained in Bintan<br>Indonesian navy said to be holding them for illegal entry<br><br>By Ben Nadarajan<br><br>ABOUT 30 Singaporeans and foreigners, who were on a dive trip in the vicinity of Pulau Tioman in the South China Sea, were stopped by what is believed to be an Indonesian navy vessel and are being detained in Bintan.<br><br>They are being held on board their 26m-long vessel, the MV White Manta, owned by Singapore company Vincent Dive Centre and registered in Thailand, and are being questioned individually about their background and what they were doing on the trip.<br><br>Advertisement<br><br>Two men are standing guard on deck at all times to make sure they do not leave the boat, which is currently berthed in the harbour of Tanjong Pinang, Bintan's biggest town.<br><br>The owner of the dive company, Mr Vincent Chew, is apparently attempting to negotiate with the Indonesians for his boat and the people on it to be released.<br><br>Each time he is contacted on his mobile phone, he says hurriedly: 'I can't talk. I'm being interrogated.'<br><br>The Singapore consulate in Pekan Baru, Sumatra, has been approached to help the group.<br><br>The White Manta set sail from Keppel Marina on Friday night with 21 Singaporeans and a handful of foreigners, to visit dive sites in the South China Sea.<br><br>They were supposed to return to Singapore on Sunday night, but on Saturday morning, a boat pulled up alongside theirs and signalled to the captain to cut his engines.<br><br>One of the passengers, a woman who wanted to be known only as Christine, told The Straits Times on her cellphone that the men 'waved their guns at us' and shouted orders in Bahasa Indonesia.<br><br>They boarded the dive boat and ordered it to go to Tanjong Pinang, following closely behind.<br><br>At the harbour, more men dressed in naval uniforms boarded the vessel and started questioning the crew, the trip's organisers and the divers.<br><br>Christine said they searched through the passenger cabins and other parts of the ship.<br><br>She claims they are demanding that the group pays a fine for sailing into Indonesian waters without proper travel documents, an allegation the dive company denies.<br><br>According to her, the Indonesians are also saying the foreigners on board do not have visas to enter Indonesia.<br><br>'They say if we don't pay the fine, they'll arrest us for illegal entry.'<br><br>She does not know the amount being asked for.<br><br>A Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MFA) spokesman could not say why the boat and its passengers had been detained. But she said the MFA had contacted the relevant Indonesian authorities and that they are providing consular assistance to the stranded crew and passengers.<br><br>Last night, a woman, who said she is the mother of one of the people on board, called The Straits Times and said she was very worried for her son, a 21-year-old undergraduate, who has been detained for four days now.<br><br>'Even if the boat accidentally sailed into the wrong area, surely there's no need to keep them for so long,' said the housewife in her late 40s, who declined to give her name.<br><br>Relatives of those on board can call MFA's duty officer on 6379-8800.<br><br>------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br><br>Questionable points.<br><br>1. Why isn't the indonesian navy going after pirates instead?<br><br>2. Why are they specially "chosen" to pay a fine?<br><br>3. tens of thousands of ships every year sails around Indonesia..<br>Why go for a group of divers instead?<br><br>4. Why Interrogated for 4 Days? Every one knows that Singaporeans<br>do not participate in malacca straits piracy..<br><br>5. And Why a Fine? Is it a new rule or what??<br><br>6. Why aren't they going for ships from other national origin?<br>is it specially singaporean ship?<br><br>7. Being questioned FOR 4 DAYS?<br>Mainly topic asked are - Background and Objective<br><br>Ask these stuff,even go into detail , at most only 1 day ,<br>to contact our MFA, only takes less then 10 seconds , by dialling a number<br><br>Why aren't they allowed to contact their lawyers or anyone?<br><br>Even normal interrogation have a certain limit of time , and i believe they are not a threat to the indonesian navy?<br><br>8. Why are they being treated like criminals and detained in their boat?<br><br>9. Is the fine a sort of bribery or something or newly introduced stuff?<br><br>10. Why are the people on the boat threatened ...to be jailed IF they do not<br>pay the fine?<br><br>Conclusion:<br><br>-Conspiracy</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Dude,<br><br>I was talking to a old hand from Police Coast Guard. He told me about the different levels of "protection" you can buy from the Indons.<br><br>The lowest level is the Immigration police. Their protection only affords you to escape unscathed when they check your boats or crafts.<br><br>The second level is the Marine Police. Their protection will mean that you are allowed to go with their blessings. It also protects you for the Immigration Police.<br><br>The highest level of protection is from the Indon Navy. This class of protection means that no pirates will dare trespass with you, you are allowed to snub your nose at the lower levels of Marine Police and Immigration Police.<br><br>Guess our poor guys only bought the lowest level of protection.</div>
