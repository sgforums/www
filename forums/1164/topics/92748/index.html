As you know the guardmen are train in both heli-deployment and amphibous operation, the AMX-10P is to support the latter operation.

            <div class='col-md body'>According to the World Defence Almanac, the SAF currently has 22 AMX10Pac90, 24 AMX10RC, 22 AMX10P and some Swedish CV90. From the small numbers of vehicles being purchased, I surmised that the purchased vehicles were used for evaluation and reversed-engineering for the development of our local armoured vehicles. The AMX10Ps and the CV90s were used for the development of the Bionix. The AMX10RC being used for the Terrex and the AMX10Pac90 and CV90s used for the development of our future replacement for the SM1s. For your info, all these vehicles purchased are not in storage but instead are still being maintained and used.These vehicles were not bought cheap to being with, so the SAF is not likely to let these vehicles rot in storage.</div>
