            <div class='col-md body'>Let's look at this this way lah harh, the Singapore govt. will never allow themselves to be outclassed in terms of equipment and training to our larger neighbours, simply because we cannot afford to do so. Also another thing in Singapore's favour. Unlike other countries around, Singapore does not believe in going into battles with grossly inaccucrate propangada and "i have the eye of the tiger" rethoric. We actually make sure that we outclass and outwit our opponent rather then go around shouting "Our cause is right, we will prevail!"<br><br>Oh yah, SAf also dun go around to bomohs to make their soldiers bulletproof with "magic" stones and charms. You can see which is a modern army here. On one hand we have an airforce that is professional, modern and well trained and on the other hand an airforce with personnel who carry third-world mentality and with badly managed logistics and funds spurged on needlessly expensive weapons systems for their situtation just because it will look good on parade. But when the AMRAAMs and dogfights start flying, we'll see who really has the edge, those who make it look like they look good on the outside, or those who actually strive to be good at what they do...</div>

IMO, you came with the intention just to make a mockery out of us and to think of it we've been very lenient to you. Nobody starts being Sincere by using the word "Idiot" in his first post.(Dammit, that topic's delete) If you call all that "Sincere", then I think you mistook the meaning of Sincere.<br><br>Look at HARIMAU, look that his post, look at the maturity he portrait in his post.

So long..<br><br>BTW, I dunno why you call us "ENEMY". I know I'm being off topic but I don't remember calling any Malaysian "My ENEMY" nor did I regard any of the malaysians as my "ENEMY", In fact I've too many malaysian frens to make enemies with. Surely I'll not call that an act of provocation.  I truely hope that the day when we call each other "ENEMY" will NEVER come. To me, you are not my enemy, you are only being mischevious and perhap "Patriotic" to your country (but showing it in the wrong way).

It can do a +/- 70 degree compared to the 60 degree off bore sight angle. The -E version Archer also has an increased range from original 15 to now 30 KM. It can also go up to 12G.<br><br>Python 4 on the other hand can do up to 70G. However, it has only a range of 15KM.<br><br>In comparison with 3 other newest WVR missiles, namely the ASRAAM, AIM-9X and IRIS-T, both Python 4 and Archers seem to fall short in off-boresight capability. With HMS and where looks can kill, should RSAF start looking at getting either ASRAAM (chosen by RAAF and RAF) or AIM-9X (USAF, USN and Swiss AF)?<br><br>References of WVR missiles:<br><a href="http://&lt;br%20/&gt;http://www.canit.se/~griffon/aviation/text/missiles/aam.html&lt;br%20/&gt;" rel="nofollow"><br>http://www.canit.se/~griffon/aviation/text/missiles/aam.html<br></a><br><br><a href="http://www.flug-revue.rotor.com/FRheft/FRH9612/FR9612g.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.flug-revue.rotor.com/FRheft/FRH9612/FR9612g.htm</a><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Whoaah, guys, dont so bad on the kiddie up north mahh... Never let me have a chance to tok to him you all scare him away already...tsk tsk tsk....<br><br>Also, the way you all degrade the hornet also reeks a little of nationalism. While its true that the Hornet is lacking in terms of range as a strike fighter, it isn't really that bad an aircraft. In fact, the Hornet is actually a <span style="font-style: italic;">slightly</span> better aircraft than the standard F-16C/D. In fact, its AoA capability in low speed regime is unrivalled in the US inventory. The reason why the F-16 wins more orders is because the F-16 provides MUCH more bang for the buck. The F-18 is a naval fighter, and was designed for the stress of carrier landings, thus the airframe is beefed up to absorb the impacts. That causes the cost of the F-18 to rise without a commensurate increase in capability.<br><br>By the way, a little info to add on to the specs of our F-16s. Our ALQ-131s are of the Block II version, and we have 6 of these. 18 of our F-16s also have the APX-109(V)3. Also, I noticed that -t- has mixed up his jammers a lottle. The ALQ-126 is not the ASPJ, the ALQ-165 is. The Malaysia just got the ASPJ a few years back. A good jammer, with jamming capabilities against CW radars - might be a challenge for our I-HAWKs.<br><br>"the US always downgrades the weapons its selling..maybe for singapore not so much...but at least a bit...they will not give u the same version they are using with the same high tech weapons and stuff"<br><br>Errr, -t- you are contradicting yourself with this statement. First, you proudly stated that your F-18Ds are the same version as USMC's, then you come out with the above statement. Kinda stupid eh? And if America chooses to downgrade equipment for us, your equipment will get more downgrading. Sorry, but after learning a lesson in Iran, I dont think they'd sell their stuff to another Islamic country without any reservations.<br><br></div>
