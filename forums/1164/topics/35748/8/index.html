            <div class='col-md body'>Innocent Malaysian or whatever schizophrenic crap you call yourself now, I'm sorry to disappoint you, but I'm not RSAF Black Knights from the Fighters Forum/aCIG. I have lurked there, in ACIG, in the old and new BATM, but unlike you, I believe empty vessels make the most noise and have sat back watching you make a fool of yourself everywhere.<br><br>As for the Hornets being good, I'm sorry, but I must have missed the post, because I did not see anything like that. Were you taking LSD and hallucinating? Sounds like it.<br><br>The fact is that while the Hornet is the best aircraft in the RMAF inventory, its more due to the limitations of the other RMAF aircraft rather than its strong points. As a strike aircraft, I would use the word ABSOLUTE CRAP because of its lack of range/endurance. With this in mind, any mitigating factors such as payloads, avionics fit etc would be negated because as a strike aircraft, if you can't get anywhere near your targets to strike it, its pointless.<br><br>As for NathanG5 flaming you. Let this be a warning to all including our dear Malaysian friend. All nasty posts and flame baits will be removed. Regardless of nationality of the poster.<br><br>One last thing, to the Malaysian budak bodoh, if you dislike us so much and think of us as biased etc etc, why then do you bother coming here? Is is because you cannot speak Melayu well so cannot join BATM actively, and in fact had your credentials and you claims to be a Malaysian kid questioned by Tomel and Saadullah Johan in the old BATM? I saw that thread, and boy, that was a real laugh!</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by cavsg:</div><div class="quote_body">last week's aviation week also mention about the python 4s. would a respected aviation magazine based its reports on rumours from here?</div></blockquote>The first rumours of Singapore and P4s appeared in a official shownews report from Asian Aerospace 1998. The report then stated that it was "believed/rumoured" that Singapore has acquired the P4. It NEVER stated that the news is a fact. Since then, I have seen the rumour become fact, although what information was used to confirm that rumour into fact was never known. What I've meant is that the institute might have taken one of these reports and further propogated the rumour as a fact.<br><br>I've never said the Swedish institute used rumours from here.</div>

What I've said, and I think the moderators have made clear repeatedly is to stick to information in the public domain. If you've heard anything from someone in the know/seen anything with your own eyes during your course of work etc thats not public knowledge please keep it to yourself and do not go blabbing about it if its not officially revealed that we have it. The last thing we want if for the forum closed for violating the OSA. Get it?<br><br>The "use" of the P4 by the RSAF falls into this category</div>
