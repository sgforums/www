            <div class='col-md body'>Y are u seems to be rather proud abt ur info on the RMAF hornets?? With internet info of the hornets and some studies on statistic reports , we can generally come up with wat the malaysian's have.<br><br>Info on our vipers had been posted on threads in the past , no one want to re-post now. With a crediable defence industry and also coupled with ties with Viper operating allies , who the hell know and will want to post the full-specs on the RSAF viper??<br><br>If u want to know about the general specs of the RSAF vipers , then jus go to the internet and search '' F-16 '' , u can get a picture of it liao.<br><br>Remember , Singapore will have her advantage over the regional countries because , we have the capacity to upgrade ur handware and software , however not in the case of the other ASEAN countries.<br><br>My take is that Singapore's F-16s is more superior to the RMAF F/A-18D . Technology wise ( remember wat MY can buy from US , SG can buy it too ) , and in terms of numerical numbers , we win!</div>
