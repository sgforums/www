            <div class='col-md body'>S.C. soldier designs new gun truck<br><br>Vehicle weighs more than 20 tons, has detachable gunnersÂ’ box<br><br>By CHUCK CRUMBO<br><br>Staff Writer<br><br>Instead of an M-16 rifle, Army Staff Sgt. James King is using his welder to help U.S. troops fighting in Iraq.<br><br><img src="http://www.thestate.com/images/thestate/state/10430/108789874110.jpg"><br><br>A member of the Army ReserveÂ’s 175th Maintenance Company, headquartered at Fort Jackson, King is the primary designer of a new gun truck aimed at better protecting U.S. convoys in Iraq.<br><br>The truck currently is undergoing a seven-day road test in Iraq and initial reports are good, Maj. Ricky Smith, the 175thÂ’s commander, reported Wednesday.<br><br>Â“So far, no one has shot at it and that is the effect we wanted Â— to scare the h--- out of the bad guys,Â” Smith wrote in an e-mail to The State.<br><br>Protecting convoys is a top priority of U.S. commanders. Troops suffer about 100 casualties a month in insurgent attacks on convoys.<br><br>Those losses have led some critics to say the Army doesnÂ’t have enough armored vehicles or ground protection for its Iraqi convoys.<br><br>The Air Force said Tuesday that it will haul more supplies on its planes to help take some of the load off the convoys.<br><br>KingÂ’s design adds an armored box, bristling with guns, that can be bolted onto the back of a heavy transport truck in a convoy. It is much different than the gun trucks the Army has used for decades. Those are quick, agile gun trucks designed to race up and down the length of a convoy to meet attackers.<br><br>KingÂ’s gun truck Â— recently unveiled at Camp Arifjan, where the 175th is stationed in Kuwait Â— weighs more than 20 tons. The vehicle originally was designed to haul a battle tank.<br><br>What makes KingÂ’s design unique is the armored gunnersÂ’ box can be transferred to another truck in about 15 minutes.<br><br>The design and construction of the box was a joint venture between the 175th and the Kellogg, Brown &amp; Root weld shop at Camp Arifjan.<br><br>Because of his experience in building smaller gun trucks, and in welding and fabrication in his regular job as a military technician, King was selected by Smith to lead the project.<br><br>It took KingÂ’s team, which included four welders, four weeksÂ’ worth of 12-hour days to design and build the box.<br><br>Â“The hardest part was coming up with some of the materials to do it with,Â” King said.<br><br>Â“ItÂ’s just like everything else in this country; youÂ’ve got to beg, borrow and steal. We had the armor, but the gun rings we had to find; the Kevlar we had to find and the exhaust we had to find.Â”<br><br>With its gun mounts about 13 feet above the ground, the box offers soldiers a crowÂ’s nest view of the area around a convoy.<br><br>Â“You get a greater view and field of fire than you can with a Humvee,Â” said Chief Warrant Officer David Summerlin, who helped on the project.<br><br>Added King, Â“At close range, (attackers) will have to aim very high, and by then, youÂ’ll see them.Â”<br><br>The walls of the box are protected on the side by several layers of Kevlar. There are a few inches between the Kevlar and the sides of the truck to absorb most of the impact and shrapnel if it is hit by a rocket-propelled grenade, King said.<br><br>That part of the design has not been tested, King said. Â“We wonÂ’t know until an RPG hits it.Â”<br><br>The box is made of three-eighths-inch-thick steel plating, which can stop most small-arms fire. The floor is reinforced with two layers of the steel plating to protect against bombs.<br><br>The box is armed with one 40-mm and one .50-caliber machine gun. It has room for two other gunners.<br><br>If the truck makes it past its first real-world road test in Iraq this week, King and the others who worked on the project will construct seven more boxes for the 7th Transportation Group.<br><br></div>
