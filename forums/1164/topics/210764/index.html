            <div class='col-md body'>Here're some questions on armour protection:<br><br>Apparently, Level 3 armour protection (eg US M8 AGS) can only withstand up to 30mm cannon.<br><br>This would mean that a dedicated AT round like the RPG-7 or our Matador and 84 will definitely make mincemeat out of the average light tank or IFV, right?<br><br>So what about the other types of modern laminate armour or ERA? Can they withstand frontal hits from RPGs, 84, Matador etc?<br><br>Can any tank withstand a frontal hit from another tank cannon of around 100 to 125mm?<br><br>I ask this because of reports of M1 Abrams being disabled by RPGs. Of course, these are usually scored on vulnerable areas not the front.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Am in London right now on holiday. 3rd trip in 20 years.<br><br>Went to the Imperial War Museum yesterday. Was a little disappointed as the number of big exhibits were quite few due to the limited indoor space and there was nothing displayed outdoors other 2 naval guns.<br><br>There were only few of the more well-known tanks.<br><br>* German Jadgzpanzer, with at least four fist-sized oles in the hull.<br>* Czech-made 1955 T-34<br>* Saladin Armoured car<br>* M3 Grant (Monty's Command tank)<br>* Matilda<br>* Churchill<br>* M4 Sherman<br><br>Of course there were other pieces like artillery, rockets, aircrafts etc. But all in all, quite few.<br><br>What amazes you, after looking at so many pictures of tanks, is to stand near one.<br><br>The size of the things is very overwhelming.<br><br>The biggest surprise was the M3 Grant. Though a "medium" tank, it was pretty damn big. It was the tallest tank of all the exhibits. The Brit 'Grant' version actually has one less turret than the US "Lee" version.
