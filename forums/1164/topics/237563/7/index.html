            <div class='col-md body'>One thing obviously forget to mention here is the AWACS, in a system vs system air combat, with or without this important asset really makes the qualitative difference.<br><br>1.	The narrow angeled cone view of fighterÂ’s fire control radar is really no way to compare to the 360 degree view of the Airborne early warning machines like E-2C or G550 AEWS.  If one side is with AEWS yet another side doesnÂ’t have it. The AEWs guided fighters are able to silently venture behind the hostile fighters by avoiding entering the cone view of the hostile fighter thus prevent from being detected. Once you achieve the position by guidance from AEWS, but for the side without the AEWS, it has to rely on its fire control radar doing all the search and broadcasting all the way of its about.<br><br>2.	In a system vs system air combat. 1 fighter is not only bonded to fight one enemy fighter. But it has to face all, thatÂ’s even you have made an excellent big turn by TVC or not, you may only out maneuver fighter A from the enemy fleet you aimed at, but to the enemy fighter B in the same fleet, the maneuvered fighter, which loses too much energy in order to gain superior position over enemy fighter A, is just a sitting duck because it ha already lost too much speed in order to achieve the big turn. So, if in a multiple fighters air combat, maintaining the overall energy state of the whole fleet is more important than the individual fighterÂ’s super-maneuverability. Even in a close in fight.<br></div>

BUT they do that a the cost of reduced maximum range.  They burn more fuel for sustained burns.  Hence, lofting AMRAAMs are still the most energy efficient and can make the most out of its range.  (IIRC one of the C models some how makes up for it and maintains equal range of with the B.)<br><br>Typically, they are best launched at high altitudes and at high sub-sonic speeds.

(Yury Zaitsev for RIA Novosti) - Malaysia will receive the first 12 of its order of 18 Sukhoi Su-30-MKM Flanker fighters, the most advanced versions of the Su-27 warplane, before the year is out. The Su-30-MKM embodies the best achievements of the Russian aircraft industry and has the most advanced European avionics.<br><br>The Malaysian version is based on the Su-30-MKI, earmarked for India, but features different equipment and an electric remote control system.<br><br>Unlike the Indian version, the Su-30-MKM features a laser warning system and missile detectors. Two Russian-made active jamming systems are located inside wing-tip containers, and the fighter also has passive jamming systems featuring dipole reflectors and 98 decoys against heat-seeking missiles in the tail section.<br><br>The Malaysian version has more Russian-made components than the Su-30-MKI because Indian and Israeli systems have been removed from it. However, the Su-30-MKM features additional French-made systems.<br><br>Russia's Bars (Snow Leopard) phased-array radar can simultaneously track at least 15 aerial targets and directs fire against four of them at a time. Moreover, it can also effectively detect ground targets.<br><br>The Su-30-MKM features the same guided weapons as the Su-30-MKI.<br><br>Malaysia has become the second country to purchase these supersonic, super-agility fighters with vectored-thrust engines. The capabilities of this version may well exceed those of the Su-30 aircraft supplied to India.<br><br>Dato' Sri Aziran bin Ariffin, commander-in-chief of the Royal Malaysian Air Force, said the Su-30-MKM was now the best fourth-generation multi-role fighter in the world.<br><br>Yury Zaitsev is an academic adviser at the Russian Academy of Engineering Sciences.<br><br>The opinions expressed in this article are the author's and do not necessarily represent those of RIA Novosti.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote>The Indian Public information Bureau report suggests a draw, despite sending slightly greener pilots. </blockquote>Well, we don`t know the exact configuration of the battle do we? If a Typhoon is going up against 3 su-30s in 1 versus 1 setting at the same time and it happens to be a draw, the Typhoon is awesome.<br><br>Unfortunately, these exercises are not 1 versus 1 match-ups. They are designed to test the unique capabilities of each aircraft in different scenarios.<br><br>The much talked about USAF F-15C encounter against the Indian Su-30 MKs encounter in India saw the USAF F-15Cs going up against more numerous Indian jets. The same F-15Cs were also prevented from using some of thier systems. Again, the objective is to test the viability and limits of the Su-30 planes.<br><br>But obviously nationalist sentiments come into play and people rejoice when they hear that thier planes have bested the F-15Cs. The truth is that they were never privy to the actual deployment and scenarios the F-15Cs were facing in the first place.<br><br>Those recent exercises have given ammunition for the recent spate of talk amongst people whose countries bought the Su-30 series of planes. They are totally unsubstantiated. They will be in for a surprise if they are to see a real match-up.<br><br>Every country which has a choice to purchase either the Su-30 series or an equivalent western jet has gone for the western one.  This is not to say the Su-30 is not a good plane though.<br><br>Someone mentioned that the RMAF and the RSAF are the best trained in SEA. I beg to differ with respect to the RMAF. The Thais are much better than the RMAF. RMAF is probably 3rd in SEA and a distant 3rd compared to the RSAF.<br><br>Like in all thier previous purchases. The RMAF will face problems getting the planes running with the plethora of systems on board. This is made worst by the fact that they do not have an industry capable enough to sort out these issues by themselves. Maintainence will continue be an issue with Russian equipment, etc. I think that they will have problems getting the different platforms talking to one another. With such a smallish airforce covering a huge area, I have a feeling they will depend more on the Super Hornets(if they buy them) in the future.</div>

The Air Force is looking at several options but sources say the French combination is in the lead because the type was recently picked to replace the Russian Zsh-7AP/KM34DII sets used by the RMAFÂ’s MiG-29N fleet.<br><br>E-Clust Technologies Sdn Bhd, MSA GalletÂ’s representative for its LA100 (for use with Russian aircraft worldwide) flight helmet, was contracted to supply 30 units to the RMAF for an undisclosed amount.<br><br>Its chief executive officer, Azman Kamaruddin, when asked, refused to say how many helmet sets are being considered for the Sukhoi fleet but it is believed that the number could be between 60 and 70 units.<br><br>In 2004, the company received a request for information (RFI) from the RMAF for the LA100.<br><br>The RFI stemmed from complaints from RMAF MiG-29 pilots that the Russian set-up they were using were too heavy. RMAF MiG-29 pilots call the Zsh-7 flight helmet Â“The Russian BatuÂ”.<br><br>In a high-G environment, the Zsh-7, which weighs 2.3kg, exerted tremendous loads on the neck and spine. Add a helmet-mounted sight (HMS) and the helmet weighs a neck-snapping 4.8kg.<br><br>By contrast, the LA100 weighs only 940g.<br><br>Because of the high-G loads experienced during air combat manoeuvres, targeting with the HMS on the Zsh-7 was also a problem as the helmet tended to Â“pull awayÂ”, dragging the target reticle along with it.<br><br>The RMAF looked at five types, including the Gentex HGU-68/P of the United States and Helmet Integrated Systems LimitedÂ’s Alpha series of Britain.<br><br>Both manufacturers have a strong presence in the country since the RMAF also uses US and British aircraft.<br><br>After a comprehensive evaluation programme by pilots of the 19th Squadron in Kuantan, the RMAF went with the LA100, citing Â“ease of integration with Russian hardware, outstanding performance under operational conditions, and flexibilityÂ” as the main reasons. Excellent support from E-Clust and MSA Gallet was also mentioned as being a factor.<br><br>The final version of the trial helmets was received in April and the rest were delivered to the 19th Squadron earlier this month. The helmet made its first public appearance at the Langkawi Maritime and Aerospace 2005 exhibition.<br><br>The RMAF MiG-29 helmet deal is significant because it was concluded in 18 months, making it one of the fastest defence procurement processes in the country.<br><br>This also marks the second time that a Western flight helmet has been successfully integrated with Russian equipment. Although the Luftwaffe (German Air Force) has been using the Gentex HGU-55/P helmet for its MiG-29 fleet for some time, the helmet is heavier, weighing 1.8kg.<br><br>Azman said the successful integration of the LA100 with the MiG-29 has opened up new possibilities.<br><br>Â“WeÂ’re getting requests for information within the RMAF for other squadrons operating other fixed-wing types,Â” said Azman. However, he declined to elaborate further.<br><br>Â“Countries like India and Indonesia operate Russian hardware; specifically, the Su-30 multi-role fighter. Operators are looking for helmets that are lighter, more comfortable and easier to maintain and upgrade with equipment from other manufacturers. From an operational standpoint, the LA100 makes perfect sense,Â” he said.</blockquote></div>
