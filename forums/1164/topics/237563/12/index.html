              <p>It has always been about systems.

              <p>And just before you say, other western jets cannot make it in terms of wvr, understand that it`s about using their respective aircrafts, combat systems and tactical advantages best.  They are all as good as the pilots, systems, systems inside planes, plane characteristics and tactics they use to maximise a win.</p>

              <p>Typhoon promo video. See how the typhoon kick the sheet out of the sukhoi.  See how the wvr missile fly into the face of the sukhoi when the sukhoi was at the tail of the typhoon. What tactic and system is that? New western planes and missiles have that. Still want to get behind a western plane`s backside? Please lar. A lot of  factors are involved. Know your plane and know what its advantages and weakneses are. And use the force multipliers which would be of tremendous advantage to you.</p>

              <p><br>Dude, u are seriously missing the point about the F-22.  Its primary feature is Stealth, not supermanueverability.  Its stealthy designs, LPI radar, and super computers are meant to help it achieve one purpose.  To SEE and SHOOT flankers or any other aerial adversary before they even realise the F-22 is out there.</p>
              <p>Its super manueverability is a supporting feature to help it achieve its role of Air Dominance when closing with the enemy, <strong>which in the first place, should not happen</strong>. But because its an Air Dominance fighter, contingencies are always considered so that it can always come out on top.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Skye2, I haven't updated myself on the F-35, but last I checked, it has only internal A2A carriage space for 2 AMRAAMs.  Other 4 will have to be carried externally.  The main internal carraige is reserved for A2G ordinance.  In other words, when stealth is required, the F-35 will only have 2 AMRAAMs loaded.</p>

              <p>Well FYI i agree with you BVR is the rule, but for your information 'most airforce' take WVR and dogfight very seriously. Disregarding the art of dogfighting  is a mistake, big mistake.</p>

              </blockquote>
              <p> Nobody is saying that modern fighters will not get into WVR action. <strong>You seem to have asserted earlier that modern fighters always get into WVR fights after expending thier BVR missiles.</strong> This is what you wrote;</p>
              <blockquote>
              <p>so what happen when both side have spent their bvr missile? RTB? of course not...you have to come close and eyeball the enemy and fight it...thats mean dogfight.</p>
              </blockquote>
              <p><strong>This is plainly wrong. </strong>The majority, if not all, of the action will be in BVR range. <strong>Planes will be shot down at BVR ranges. Maneuvres will be made at BvR ranges. Tactics will be played at BVR ranges.</strong> As pricey moving objects with a human at the heart of it, they will maximise thier chances to kill and not be killed; which can only be done at BVR ranges. You <strong>get into WVR only when you have no choice.</strong> But even then, modern jets like the Typhoons and F15SGs are more than able to kill off thier enemies using thier own advantages; especially so when leveraging on force multipliers like AWACs/AEWs and other systems. But why even bother when you can kill off your enemies at BVR ranges using a variety of strategies, tactics and systems.</p>
              <p>Even the Russians know that which is why BVR missiles are being created with ever greater ranges. The Amraam 120-D can shoot from as far as 180 km. Check your map and see how far that is.</p>
              <p><strong>Also, planes from both sides do not simply form up in a line and fire bvr missiles and wait for them to come at you and then go for a dog-fight.</strong> It`s this kind of one-dimensional thinking that will get you killed; especially against air-forces with AWACs, modern systems,etc. It is bereft of strategy and tactics.</p>
              <p>Shotgun has provided a useful example. Stealth fighters like the F-22s and F-35s do not even want to be seen when in combat; and correctly so. Anyway, it would be absolutely hard to see them if they go in nose-cold and directed by AWACs/AEW planes or UAVs. All the enemy is going to see first is a slew of BVR missiles coming at them. How many will survive? 1? 2? 3? The remaining ones might try to get in closer but again, the F35s/F-22s would have flown further than thier radar can track properly(plus stealth)and yet still be in position to let loose another slew of BVR missiles. But seriously, the enemy will pull back to save thier aircrafts rather then try and do a suicide mission. The same can be said of F-15s, Typhoons, F-16s, etc. While they lack stealth, they will be able to leverage on systems which will allow them to see first, shoot first and react first. </p>
              <p>That is why modern air forces strive to to have the capability of seeing first and shooting first from long ranges. How do they do this? Answer: Good systems which combine an entire array of platforms. An entire system of sensors and shooters.</p>

              <p>That is right. Yada yada yada. Come back when they have a working and combat ready jet. Among the examples you have provided, the only one with any hope of succeeding anytime soon is the Pak-FA. And even so, it will be ready earliest sometime next decade. But as far as aircraft development go, this would mean that they will be ready for sales probably after 2020; after all tests are done. And that is assuming the Russians even want to sell them in the first place and risk proliferation issues like the F-22. But the F-22 might be available for sale then so we`ll have to see.</p>
              <p>As far as I`ve heard, the Pak-fa will be the equivalent of the F-35 and will not be as stealthy as the latter with no internal carriage for weapons. Just lower RCS.</p>

More commonly, visual confirmation of the target is needed before weapons can be fired, and thus WVR maneuverability, and short range missiles like the AIM-9X are important.

Any <strong>tom, dick and harry</strong> can come up with the above examples. Do you know that you patronize people by coming up with airy fairy ideas about how there is always deception in air combat and such. Are you so dense as to not appreciate the fact that people already know about this; much less air forces? I have to admit that im no pilot but your ideas are off the planet sometimes.</p>
              <p>Lol. Do a search on goggle and voila. ^ The only one person who should open his eyes more is you. A little bit more thinking before you open your mouth will help too or you will be opening yourself to ridicule. Finally, do not point an accusatory finger at others if you can`t take the comments that come after that. <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/redones/biggrin.png" alt="biggrin.png"> And do not point at me hor. Im just a poor Ah beng who hate farmers.  <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/set1/cry.png" alt="cry.png"> </p>

              <p>Skye2 forget it.  I've said it before.  Let him have his WVR fantasies.</p>
              <p>He's bringing up 1960s examples of campaigns, a period where BVR was still science fiction.</p>
              <p>Let me correct myself over my last post.  There is a difference between merge and dogfight.  The merge is the entry into close range combat.  If I were to merge and blowthrough, I would not enter a dogfight since I'm gaining lateral seperation from my enemy.  Hence technology today allows a pilot to target high-aspect weapons on the merge and allows them to blow through without having to "Turn" and formally enter the "dogfight." The window for escape at that point is still rather wide, however the moment I have to turn, my window for escape closes, and I either have to win a turning fight or die trying.</p>
              <p>Air Combat Doctrine in most Air Forces revolves around destroying enemy aircraft at Beyond visual range.  MOST.  The rest of the air forces do not practice that simply cause they do not have the latest generation of BVR weapons like the AMRAAM.  I'm simply saying, Air Forces with BVR weapons, will fight BVR. Period.  </p>
              <p>tankfanatic, I found your posts extremely annoying, ill-researched and full of fantasy-situations.  Before you continue this discussion, please read up on topics such as F-Poles, A-Poles and "Grinder" and think of how it will impact an Air to Air engagement given to forces equipped with Active BVR Missiles such as the AMRAAM.</p>

              <p>and when you said 'most'...that sounds a lot, in reallity majority of airforce around the world didnt have the latest BVR and trained their pilot in WVR and they wary the existance of AMRAAM...and a lot of them do figure out ways to defeat it.</p>

              <p>sigh...yes, yes...i never dispute the advantage of BVR! i only said in the event the enemy were hell bent in attacking you and both side have spent their BVR...it is inevitable the fight will turned into a dogfight....</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>and BVR missile can be defeted, and easier jammed than an aircraft..obviously skye is in other word lack the  copy and paste skills....by saying this:</p>

              <p>Wrong again. All modern airforces have BVR weapons and the latest ones too. Lol. More airy-fairy ideas. You are losing credibility fast. Im pretty sure air-force pilots invest a lot of time in tactics to maximise gain and reduce losses. The problem with you is that you are unable to swallow the fact that your airforce is poorly equipped at the moment.  As such, you try and paint a better picture of it via WVR combat using general ideas which amounts to nothing. Im sure you we have already agreed on these points;</p>
              <p>1) Aerial warfare is no longer about individual platforms but entire systems. Systems are force multipliers which allow individual platforms to perform significantly better than without it. See first, shoot first, track first, etc, etc.</p>
              <p>2) BVR will dominate air combat from now henceforth.</p>
              <p>3) In WVR, Western jets are just as capable if not more capable than the Ruskies via thier own niches. In the case of Western combat jets, the greater emphasis is on systems and weapons. For example, the current Amraam 120-C5s/C7s and the incoming 120-D are already better than the Russian equivalent. The AIM-9X and Asraam are much much better than the R-73s.</p>
              <p>What is there to argue any more?</p>
