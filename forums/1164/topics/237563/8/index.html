            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote>One question. Who will be translation russian into malay for the manual books? </blockquote>That is already an expressed problem officially. It is not just Russian but French, South African, etc as well. How they tie all these together would be difficult. They say the planes would be fully combat ready only by 2010. However, I doubt that and it may take even longer.<br><br>But manuals are one thing. Integration of different technology from different sources is another. For example, have they got the planes to talk to one another? The Indians took 6-7 years to fully integrate Israeli technology with Russian ones; even with help from the Israelis. The MAF have more on thier plate to mix and match. Conversely, the Malaysians, unlike the Indians, do not even have a good industrial base to leverage upon .<br><br>So, they are turning to the Indians for help who are closer to us and the Israelis.</div>

In other words, there will be x no. of hardware requested (by the buyer) from the defence contractor and the option cost + x no. of hardware is stated in the Contract.<br><br>Therefore the contractor will specify $$$ for the option hardware, and such $$$ may be discounted (in view if the earlier purchases), BUT in order for the buyer to 'enjoy' this so-call discounted rates, normally the contractor will specify an expiry date in which the buyer MUST exercise if not, the 'discounted' rates will not stand and the contractor has a 'right' to increase cost for the similiar hardware.<br><br>Therefore, for the South Korean AF, there was an option to purchase an additional 40+ F-15K but I'm not sure did the KAF exercise that right.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I doubt they will be fully combat ready by 2010. They have yet to even write the operational manuals because the Russians do not operate this kind of aircraft nor build a proper simulator. Neither have they fully resolved the integration issues. I suspect the Russians put the diverse equipment in the chassis and ensured that they are working at a minimal level and left the rest(integration issues)to the RMAF. Oh, they can certainly fly the planes like the Indons which bought the Sukhois without proper systems and avionics. But, to say that the plane is fully combat ready is an entirely different thing. In effect, they have created yet another problem for themselves due to thier bizzare procurement habits.</div>

Malaysia's new acquisitions are specifically a commitment to sustain and improve a well-balanced conventional force," he added.<br><br>Najib said the handing over of the Su-30MKM also marked continued good bilateral relations between Malaysia and Russia.<br><br>He said the cooperation that began with the MiG-29N deliveries in the 1990's which had now been supplemented by the Sukhoi aircraft with their greater range and powerful armament, was evidence of Russia's readiness to develop further cooperation with Malaysia, especially in the field of high technology.<br><br>In May 2003, Malaysia ordered 18 Sukhois at RM3.42 billion. <strong>Six of the aircraft had been received since June this year and are based at the RMAF base in Gong Kedak at the Kelantan-Terengganu border.</strong><br><br>Meanwhile, RMAF chief Jen Tan Sri Azizan Ariffin said the Sukhoi squadron would be fully operational by the end of next year, and currently four pilots were undergoing training in Russia and more would be sent there after the first batch completed their course.<br><br>-- BERNAMA<br><br></div>
