True enough, getting a Russian aircraft to carry a NATO- weapon is not an easy task, but it really does seem to me that only the shell and the legs of the Sukhoi MKM are Russian.  Naturally, I doubt they would have decided to arm the Sukhoi up with Matra Magics or anything like that.  I was thinking more along the line of Exocets.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hmm feel sad lor.  It's our pilots who will feel scared though. The MICA is a very impressive missile somthing between a sidewinder and the AMRAAM i think.<br><br>Anyway regarding the -cross usage of missiles and bombs-  Generally the problem is the the SOFTWARE is not meant for the targetting for weapons of different nations.<br><br>I.E. Your Russian Radar might detect a plane coming towards you at 200km away.  However, your French CPU cannot create a lock/track on the enemy plane because it doesnt understand Russian coding. It can also not communicate to your USA coded Missile telling it to launch and kill the plane. Hence there's the problem.<br><br>It goes the same with bombs. The bomb sights meant for US planes are tailored to calculate the FALL/GLIDE rate of US bombs.  THe FALL/GLIDE rate of Russian or Euro bombs are different and so you will never hit your target accurately.<br><br>Last of all the hardpoint attachments are all different. You cant just hook a russian bomb to a US plane. The lock/joint points are all at different locations.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>They're not that hard to take down.  Quantity does count too.  How many times can these Flankers Sortie without getting shot down?  How long does it take for them to turn around?  Can their engines last?<br><br>Without having them in sufficient numbers, they may not be able to match RSAF's sortie rate. Its like a dai dee game, you may have 4 aces, and other chapalang cards, but i got 2kings, 2queens 2 jacks.  Only difference is, after u throw finish ur 4 aces, u don't game. =D</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote>one thing is for sure<br><br>RSAF is in deep @@@* with these MIGs around in the event of a conflict</blockquote>They said the same about the Mig-29s way back then until they started getting shot down all over the middle east and europe. There is always a lot of mighty talk about russian equipment and i think the russians want it that way too. It`s a selling position. Do you hear the Americans talking the same way? They dont have too.lol. The su-30s are hardly tested in combat.<br><br>On paper, our F-16s(plural) will cream anything the Malaysians have; including the Su-30 as well.  The F-15SG is more than capable of bringing down the Su-30 one on one as well. And Singapore is only getting started on procuring the F-15SGs.<br><br>Remember, the Su-30s was not even short listed by the RSAF. And the RSAF`s procurement process is solid and watched widely around the world.<br><br>It is widely known that if a country can get thier hands on a 4th generation Western plane, they will do so.<br><br>Interstingly, the Indians took 6-7 years to get everything together on the MKI. The MKM has more variety than the MKI where equipments go. It would be interesting to see if they turn out to be white elephants only to be ready for a fight when the whole world has passed them by. Have they got the planes to talk to another yet? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"></div>
