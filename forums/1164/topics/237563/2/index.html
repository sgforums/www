            <div class='col-md body'>They are less reliable because they are nationally based. This has got nothing to do with prejudice. They are simply less factual. Especially those written that are literally waving the Malaysian flag. This waters down the credibility of such magazines. Of course, it`s a totally different thing if you`re Malaysian.<br><br>Just take a look at ADJ/Tempur(espaically Tempur). The majority are about Malaysian equipment. The topics which cover equipment from elsewhere are generalistic and often come with errors.  Not too long ago, they reported that the Endurance class LST/LPDs are carrying baraks. Pure speculation. Hardly credible. They even mis-represented(or rather under-represented) the size of the RSAF about a year ago.<br><br>Problems with the Sukhoi purchase? This is hardly new. Even by reading the report(especially the last part), you`ll realise that maintaining and upgrading these assets will be a problem equipment-wise. The same will all thier other purchases. I would not be surprised they end up ala the Migs or skyhawks. Some would call it a `zoo.'</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Tempur is not nationally based magazine, they are a bit critical about ATM (read the last part about Sukhoi's), most of the critical part are writen in malay, some of their writers are from Perajurit, they left Perajurit due to office politic and disagreement on certain issues and form Tempur. Perajurit is the one waving the flag or the one carrying balls. They are all civilians.<br><br>Ofcourse it's about malaysian, if you want to read about foreign equipment then you read foreign magazines....i used to buy israeli magazine like Born in Battle and Defence Update during the 80's, most article is about israels equipment and i'm not complaining because that is what i want, pictures and stories of israeli stuff, but i also understand that it's not accurate either due to local censorship. Ofcourse Janes and Military Technology talk about foreign stuff but not much pictures on Asian nation....im sure many are not that stupid as to buy malaysian magazine hoping to read about american or Nato war machine, yes they wrote it also but dont waste time reading it....and i'm sure people are not that stupid to expect all magazine tell the real secret of their war machine.....Why should we be bothered with  Tempur or Perajurit mis-represented (or rather under-represented) the size of the RSAF? If we want to read about the SAF then we should read it in our local magazines or websites, David Boey write good stuff in the Starits Times, if we're lucky enough janes and military technology will write something or you can go here  http://pdff.sytes.net/index.php?showtopic=1192 a lot of stuff from the newspaper or magazines about singapore......<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Ah i see, you felt the brunt of my comments having bought so many magazines from these publishers over at Johor Bahru.  I have read some of the articles found in Tempur too. As far as credibility is concerned, they are behind international magazines like Janes, etc. The fight between the two privately owned magazines is interesting but again it supports the point that they have to fight for readers to stay afloat.<br><br>While you cannot take in verbatim everything any magazine says. You cannot possibly take in more as per what is represented in these local magazines. It is no different than reading a locally produced magazine on military issues. Like any other competitive magazine on sale to the masses, they need to ensure they stay profitable. They are no different than your run of the mill magazine you find in the newstand.<br><br>And no. Tempur is witten largely in Malay. Tempur is started in Malaysia. I am sure many are not stupid enough to discern its clientale where readership is concerned. Hence, Tempur is a local magazine and with it, the gap where credibility is concerned. And if i want to read more about thier military, i would read thier publications produced by the MAF first. Like our Pioneer, etc. And then perhaps Janes and so on and so forth. Local magazines like Perajurit and Temput would be last.  AdJ too.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>well, like tankfanatic, i bought those magazine for the pictures, but only ATM's photo not other foreign countries photo as i can get those in the net, not the  article....Janes pay for infomation, my friend's skin is thick enough to complain the price of JDW compare to the quality of paper or pictures in that magazine, so he got the answer directly from them....i dont think tempur or any other magazine from malaysia pay for those info but only to journalist (who want to work for free?)....Right now i'm interested about the Philippines New indigenous armored vehicle, so where can i get those? obviously here the philippines forum and not Tempur or Perajurit  http://pdff.sytes.net/index.php?showtopic=4320 .....if janes were to publish it, it'll be either a month from now and with only 1 photo......</div>
