              <p>Its not about the manuevers, seriously.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Its about retaining the energy to point your nose where it needs to be in order to launch weapons.  Thats what the demonstrations are about.</p>
              <p>At BVR, thats not gonna be worth a lot they'll be flying about at tactical speeds where thrust vectoring and high alphas doesn't contribute to manuevering. Neither thrust vectoring, high AOA capability nor airshow manuevers are gonna save these flankers from getting swatted by an AMRAAM.  In this case, 2, just to be sure.</p>

              <p>It's more like...erm raw numbers and how many missiles you can actually let go (lock and fire) before you have to take evasive manuevour? The one who shoot first and if the missile hits it's an advantage.</p>
              <p>12planes v 12planes say 4 bvr each</p>
              <p>48 v 48 (each fires one)</p>
              <p>36 vs 36( one side down 2 one side down 3)</p>
              <p>30 vs 27(advantage here)</p>
              <p>each unleash one again (10 missiles vs 9 missiles)</p>
              <p>20 vs 18 (19 missiles likely more kills than 9 missiles)</p>
              <p>So training and coordination will allow one side to actually hit more and the advantage usually will continue until the other side retreats.</p>

              <p>You having too much childish thoughts lar you. what..combat jets are going to stop like 19th century riflemen and both sides fire thier bvr missiles and wait? And when no more missiles charge for hand to hand combat is it or in this case wvr duel? :) What are strategy, tactics, numbers, jamming systems on board combat planes and detection/jamming systems like AEWs planes, UAVs, etc for? What is the integration of all these systems for? Why integrate Formidable class Aster 15s/30s, I-hawks, etc into a network? Hello, this is`nt the 20th century anymore. You are fighting systems. An enemy plane does not have to jammed and destroyed by other enemy planes. They can be knocked out by missiles from a ship for instance or mobile SAM systems. </p>

                      <p>It has always been about systems. Just got more complicated and sophisticated. Dumbo...F-22 carries 6 Amraams and 2 sidewinders. 6 bvr missiles and 2 wvr missiles.Tells u a lot about where the battle will be. (By the way, f-35 can carry 6 AAMs internally <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Cartoon/shade.png" alt="shade.png">. Eat sheet invaders!! ) The reason why it is fast and maneuverable is that it is made to face hordes of russian fighters; just in case it has to get into a fight to get out.</p>
                      
                      <p>And just before you say, other western jets cannot make it in terms of wvr, understand that it`s about using their respective aircrafts, combat systems and tactical advantages best.  They are all as good as the pilots, systems, systems inside planes, plane characteristics and tactics they use to maximise a win.</p>

              <p>Typhoon promo video. See how the typhoon kick the sheet out of the sukhoi.  See how the wvr missile fly into the face of the sukhoi when the sukhoi was at the tail of the typhoon. What tactic and system is that? New western planes and missiles have that. Still want to get behind a western plane`s backside? Please lar. A lot of  factors are involved. Know your plane and know what its advantages and weakneses are. And use the force multipliers which would be of tremendous advantage to you.</p>

              <p><br>Dude, u are seriously missing the point about the F-22.  Its primary
              feature is Stealth, not supermanueverability.  Its stealthy designs,
              LPI radar, and super computers are meant to help it achieve one
              purpose.  To SEE and SHOOT flankers or any other aerial adversary
              before they even realise the F-22 is out there.</p>
              <p>Its super
              manueverability is a supporting feature to help it achieve its role of
              Air Dominance when closing with the enemy, which in the first place,
              should not happen. But because its an Air Dominance fighter,
              contingencies are always considered so that it can always come out on
              top.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Skye2, I haven't updated myself on the F-35, but last I checked, it has only internal A2A carriage space for 2 AMRAAMs.  Other 4 will have to be carried externally.  The main internal carraige is reserved for A2G ordinance.  In other words, when stealth is required, the F-35 will only have 2 AMRAAMs loaded.</p>

              The F-35 is a pesky stealth air to air/multi-role fighter that will cause a lot of problems to any air forces which dont have equally capable combat jets. It has also been reported that Israel is building internal racks so the F-35s can carry all manner of munitions and not just American ones. 
              
              ------------------------------------------------------
              Six-Shooting Lightning
              
              
              The Joint Strike Fighter could be upgraded to carry up to six internal AIM-120 AMRAAM Advanced Medium Range Air-to-Air Missiles, according to a Lockheed Martin executive. "Our spiral development program includes the ability to carry up to six internal AMRAAMs", G. Richard Cathers, senior manager of Lockheed Martin's strategic studies group, told the IQPC Fighter Conference in London on Wednesday. "It's a capability second only to the F-22."
              
              Cathers added that the JSF's air-combat capability "has not been advertised as it could or should have been", partly because "at the same time as we are developing the F-35, we and the USAF have wanted to expand the F-22 program." Apparently, the USAF has not wanted to advertise the JSF's air-to-air capability, concerned that it would weaken the case for acquiring more than the 183 F-22s authorized today.
              
              The four added internal AMRAAMs would be carried in place of internal bombs. It's not clear, however, whether the short-take-off, vertical landing F-35B variant, which has smaller weapon bays, would be able to carry the added weapons.
              
              An executive for a competing fighter program, speaking at the conference, said that the six-missile capability would be a major improvement for the JSF. Until now, competitors have criticised the JSF because it carries only two AAMs - supporting only a single engagement - in stealth mode.

              <p>Very interesting and another feat of engineering.</p>
              <p>Trying to put AMRAAMs into the internal bomb bay would require some kinda adhoc Rolling Amraam ejector mechanism.  Remove ejector when armed with A2G weapons and replace with JDAM ejectors.  I wonder if that would blow the weight budget again..</p>
