            <div class='col-md body'>Btw, we are talking about the Sukhoi-30MKM here.

Their engines are so kick-ass powerful that they need more time in maintenance than western counter parts.  Why do you think the Russian AC can perform all those edge of flying limit manuevers?  Its cos they almost got a rocket strap to their back to be able to recover. (not discounting pretty smart aeronautical designs. *applauds* )<br><br>These Russian beasts are meant for war time operations.  They take off, and their engines are pushed to the limits.  This was particularly prevalent during the Cold war simply cos the Soviets figured most of them won't be coming back anyways. So its alright to make them maintenance intensive.<br><br>For RMAF Ops... Good luck getting flight hours out of those engines.  Its gonna cost.<br><br>The Sukhoi-27 series are magnificent aircraft to behold at air shows.  "WtF?!  I didn know planes can fly like that?!"  But the combat value behind the stunts?  Huge RCS of the Su-30 that can be detected more than 80 miles away by e F-16's "tiny" radar.  Does that really help?<br><br>Super manueverable, but u can't dodge a slammer if u're within its sure kill zone.<br><br>Our initial acquisition cost for the F-15SG maybe higher, but our maintenance wont be a b1tch like theirs.  Our upgrade options are plentiful.  Theirs?  They've got French, Russian and South African equipment all stuffed into 1 turkey.  Anytime wanna tamba something, need to consult so many people for integration.<br><br>F-15SG will lose to the Su-30? I don't think so.

We can`t really say which aircraft is better because a lot of variables play a part in a dog fight. It is said that the F-16 outperforms the Mig-29s at a certain altitude and vice-versa.<br>But as mentioned before, the system upgrades that has been done to the F-16 series already make the latter a better plane than the Mig-29s. An example is the Israeli F-16I.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote>On the integration of the various component , it can be done just have to spend money to write the code<br><br></blockquote>Easier said than done. A lot of these companies would not simply release the codes. Try the Americans. It is likely, if not a certain fact, that you would need to work with these companies when integrating these components. How you synergise and bring together these separate entities is a totally different matter altogether. It would not be easy. The Indians had the Israelis to assist them and that took 6-7 years. The Indian MKI had even lesser component parts from other countries. Is the RMAF going to finally operate the Su-30 &gt;2014 in combat ready mode?<br><br>Yes, it will probably cost much more in the end. You have not even talked about integration with all the other equipment in the air-force itself or other branches of the military. I doubt the RMAF will buy any more Su-30 until they have resolved all the teething issues which will take a long time to be resolved. Hence, the RMAF would probably be facing the same kind of problems they have always had resulting in a vicious cycle. Getting the Superbugs could be a life-saver. And I think the RMAF officials understand this very well. Oh my, is it a case of deja-vu with the current hornets and Migs? Weird. Old habits die hard huh.<br></div>

May I point out a few points in regards to high boresight missile. The idea behind it is that the missile can lock with a target within its aquisition envelope which is around 70 to 90 degrees so that the a/c does not have to turn and point its nose in the direction of the shot. Soon after firing the missile will turn to follow the target which may be on a reverse course of the firing a/c (i'm assuming this as you dont need a high boresight missile to do a tail shot on target). Now a wvr missile burns it's rocket engine for only a short while, around 2 seconds plus minus, which in turns will accelerate the missile to a very high speed, then rely on kinetic energy for the final approach for the kill.<br><br>In regards to that, if a wvr missile is launched to a target with a hight traverse rate (ie crossing your a/c) or on a reverse course of your a/c, the missile would need to make a sharp turn which in turn will slow the rate of acceleration as part of the energy is needed to make the turn to target. that will leave the missile with less kinetic energy for the final approach for kill as the rocket burn time is still the same. this means high boresight engagement will reduce the max distance of engagement drastically . Take this into account of firing to a very highly maneuverable (i hate to spell this word) a/c which in turn can change its heading quickly and have powerful engines to recover potential energy/altitude and can trade altitude for speed/kinetic energy quickly, the percentage for a high boresight missile to get a kill is reduced. compare that with "legacy maneuvering (that word again)" fighter in which the missile can get a upper hand.<br><br>In dog fighting the a/c with the better energy (be it potential ie altitude or kinetic ie speed) will have a much better chance to turn and get a tail position. That in turn will maximise your wvr missile or any missile for that matter. It's not without reason that the raptor has tvc to supplement the agility. I think one of you guys, arthas 79 pointed out :-<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;"> The F-15SG is better or at least on par with the Su-30.

They requested the f-4 phantom and decided not to put guns in because <span style="font-style: italic;"> dogfights are a thing of the past now </span>. They were damn sure that phantoms and sparrow combinations will be the <span style="font-style: italic;">be all and end all</span>. Boy were they wrong. they went and swollowed their pride and eqquipped the coming variants and versions with podded guns. In statements above, systems are good and dandy and all, but if history is taken into account, after the first picket of bvr missiles is launched by both sides, there will still be jinkin' and yankin' and turnin' and burnin' by military aviators around the world.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br><br>In regards to statement concerning iraqi mig 29 performance in gw1, my personal belief is that it's down to sheer training and operations failure. There are reports of the luftwaffe mig-29 which gave good account of themselves in dact and also the fpda exercises back in early 2000 between the RMAF migs and the RAAF bugs in which the migs did give good account of themselves also. having the best equipment is fine and good, but it's not the final word. the RSAF have the best equipment in SEA and a good force structure and also good training for her military aviators. that's why they are the best in sea. in the same regards RMAF is not far back in terms of quality of training, and a bit further of in terms of equipment. that said they certainly have proven themselves in various dacts run by fpda and also few of the cope taufan (i think) dact exercises. The TNI-AU is bugged by the quality if the maintenance personnel and also by the recent arms embargo. i'm not sure if the bulk of their f-16s are in flying condition and also the issue in regards to the su27 and 30 (2 of each) which complicates their logistics greatly.<br><br>Wah tired already, Ding Chavez signing out.

            <div class='col-md body'>Dogfighting si the way of the past. The reason why Russians emphasized agility is so that a trained pilot can out maneuver some of the older generation AAMs. However, the newer BVRAAM are fast and quick and harder to dodge.

A missile able to reverse the direction of its flight path, e.g., 180.degree. turn, is able to provide a capability to destroy rearward approaching aircraft before they are able to be within firing range of the host aircraft. A combat advantage is also provided in a fly-by scenario where an enemy aircraft passes the host aircraft traveling the opposite direction. If the missile can turn rapidly enough, the enemy aircraft can not escape being defeated. Thus, the time which the maneuver consumes, the velocity of the missile after the maneuver, and the turning radius or distance which the missile deviated from its desired flight path is critical to the life and death nature of the engagement.<br><br>Thus, one application exhibiting an immediate need for improved efficiency in maneuvering is an air launched interceptor missile. The intuitive approach to reversing an air launched interceptor missile's flight path based on conventional maneuver control is a steady high-g turn. The missile system applies control force to rotate the missile system's nose to a desired angle-of-attack to achieve an aerodynamic normal force providing a lateral component of acceleration to rotate the missile system's velocity vector and therefore its flight path angle. During the intuitive maneuver, forward velocity is necessary to produce aerodynamic force and to maintain an angle-of-attack. The angle-of-attack is typically limited to reduce the parasitic effects of aerodynamic axial forces, to maintain stability of the vehicle during the sustained maneuver, and to constrain aerodynamic loading beneath the structural limit of the missile body.............<br><br>One missile system developed specifically for such demanding maneuvers is the Python 4 manufactured by Rafael Industries and sold by the Israeli government, a line drawing of which is shown in FIG. 6. The Python 4 includes twenty-one (21) flight surfaces to achieve this performance-an inordinately high number of flight surfaces for a missile system that makes it expensive to manufacture and difficult to maintain. One reason for the Python 4's design complexity is the demands of implementing the intuitive approach for reorienting the missile described above and illustrated in FIG. 4. The Russian AA-11 missile system shown in FIG. 7, likewise, implements this intuitive approach to reorient the missile system to perform a 180.degree. turn.</blockquote><a href="http://www.freepatentsonline.com/6308911.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.freepatentsonline.com/6308911.html</a><br><br></div>

The reason why Russians emphasized agility is so that a trained pilot can out maneuver some of the older generation AAMs. However, the newer BVRAAM are fast and quick and harder to dodge. The only way to avoid getting hit is to shoot first before the opponent does.</blockquote>Not just newer long or medium range range missiles.<br><br>Shorter range missiles like the Python-4/5 series and the AIM-9X(which incidentally the RSAF deploys) are so much quicker and agile than the planes themselves; with or without TVC. The current key Western planes are agile and powerful enough to use these newer missiles with maximum effect. Otherwise, you will see TVC engines popping up everywhere.<br><br>In addition, no one can argue(where they are combat proven) about the systems(radar, avionics, etc) on board Western machines. The same cannot be said about Russian ones. Even old Mahathir admits that the RMAF ought to have gone for Western equipment.<br><br>Also, it is not just about systems on board individual planes but an entire spectrum of other systems and platforms which help combat planes in seeing first, shooting first, evading first, etc. <strong>This is no longer a case of plane A versus plane B.</strong> The West clearly has the lead in this regard where the decisive power to decide the pace, location, etc of battles are in thier hands.<br><br>Countermeasures and ECMs might help a bit. But the latter is more luck than anything else in my opinion. So, clearly, the planes and therefore air-forces with the better over-arching or encompassing systems(internally or in concert with other units) win the day. The West clearly lead in this regard where they will see first, shoot first and claim the airspace first.<br><br>What more in Singapore`s case where we have the largest and most comprehensively integrated and advanced air force in SEA.<br><br>Also, I happened to ask a pilot during AA2005 about TVCs and he said that at the end of the day it is how you maximise the individual strengths of your plane and the maximise the weaknesses of the enemy plane. Even the humble Harrier can bring down a Mig-29. Of course the Mig-29 can win naturally by using other tactics.<br><br></div>

All i'm saying the energy to make the turn will lessen the overall kinetic energy of the missile.<br><br>in an aircraft, be it manned or not, menauvering is all about total energy. total energy is a sum of altitude (potential energy) and speed (kinetic energy) in a fighter doing a turn will bleed of speed, in turn bleed of energy. to regain that energy, the pilot can either trade his altitude for speed by diving or punch his engines and accelerate to regain the total energy. In a wvraam missile, the impulse acceleration by the booster will only last for 2 seconds, after that it relies totally on kinetic energy. that's why bvraams accelerate and gain altitude after being fired so as to be able to convert the altitude to speed during the final approach. Also bvraams has a longer booster burn time. but for wvraam after the boost phase is done the missile will rely totaly on kinetics. if within that period it has to make a turn, the speed hence the kinetic energy will bleed and the missile will have less energy and cannot regain that energy as it cannot lose altitude or accelerate to regain that energy.<br><br>That said the current crop of wvraam and bvraam is very capable and have a high PK. As the other forumer pointed out, most of the air superiority will depend on the bvraam for kills. as he also pointed out correctly, dogfighting will be less of an issue. but then again as i said in previous post, after the first picket of bvraams, as history pointed out, there will still be some yankin and burnin.</div>

It takes time for the missile to cover the distance, and if the missile's motor doesn't provide sustained boost, it actually loses kinetic energy for every mile it flies.<br><br>Second, Chaff still works with some effectiveness against.
