              <p>I know that this thread might be already cold but I still like to add my 2 cents worth.</p>
              <p>We may be actually getting over complacent in recent years. Sure, we have our 60+ Block 52 F-16's and (should be) 20+F-15S in our orbat. Sure we can kick ass if there happen to be a threat with what we have. But it seems like we are getting a little over zealous with our capabilities and down right ignorant with our neighbours. Have gone to become too proud?</p>
              <p>It may sound ridiculous but history is repeating itself. We have grown into what our previous unwanted colonial masters use to be...... plain ignorant. "The Japanese are short sighted buck teeth asians that can hardly keep their aircraft in the air." Sounds firmiliar.</p>
              <p>I have been to our Air Force's briefings and that kind of attitude is prevalent. In fact when the Intel Officers reaches the part about potential threats and our closest neighbour, there was a wave in the air and a snigger saying "MAS" - "Mana ada Systems  HA!  ha! ha!" He actually could not be bothered to talk about it. Then someone actually demanded that he touches on the subject.</p>
              <p>He gave a very reluctant answer. - "Too many different types of aircraft. Logistically, very difficult to maintain aircraft. Aircrafts half U/S. (unserviceable). So there is no threat. Their ground crew are a lazy lot. Further more we don't think their pilots are any good."</p>
              <p>WOW!!!! Talk about complacent. My jaw dropped so fast that i was rubbing my chin 2 seconds latter. Come on man Please lah.... they want us to think that is so. It is an counter intelligence method call dis-information!!!!  I came across an book call "Mercenaries" (can't remember the author off hand).</p>
              <p>The RMAF subcontracts out the maintenance of their A/C to American and Russian companies. So do you really think that so many of their front line fighters are U/S?????</p>
              <p>So they bought 20 AMRAAMS... how many AMRAAMS does Singapore have before we concluded the F-15S deal?</p>
              <p>Sometimes it is wiser to do a little self examination and soul searching before we decide to write them off... don't you agree??<img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Blue/omg.png" alt="omg.png"></p>

              <p>Well i personally always believe, if they have something. Always assume the equipment is 100% ready and is 130% capable.  From what you said, i assume you are in the air force?</p>
              <p>I must say, ground ops will be much easier if we have clear skies AND CAS.  If those stick jockies get too stuck up, things can just unravel.</p>
              <p>Personally, ever since their newest PM took over, i notice alot of speeding up and more efficient running of their govenrnment agencies.</p>
              <p>Take a look at the recent floods and even the groceries price rises, their government reacted very swiftly and that's very applaudable. (water trucks deployed, food stocks released, swift contamination of illegal food exports, implementation of food controls.  )</p>
              <p>So in a sense i agree that we shouldnt rest on our laurels. Not a bit otherwise, we will not only be unable to rise to the occasion but worst off, collapse like a ton of bricks with just a single hard kick.</p>
              <p>No i wouldnt believe that they stuff is mainly U/S. At least not as bad as it was some years back.  Nowadays the military equipment is like modern civilian cars.  As long as you top up the petrol, water and engine oil, it will run and run rather well especially their new equipment.</p>

              <p>No, I'm a grunt, your typical everyday foot soldier. Just happened to be invited by the airedales to their little party. I guess maybe we infantry types are more down to earth.</p>
              <p>Me and my fellow army types went away feeling very worried after the briefing thinking what is going to happen when the sh**t hits the fan when our high flying brothers in arms are basking in their own "glory".</p>

              <p>We are a declining nation. Glory is in the past, oh no we never had it, gloom is ahead of us. While we tried and some still do to be a secular nation many now want this be changed to an Islamic state.</p>
              <p>and the 4 Sukhois have no weapons aside from cannon ammo.......nothing. Really. Perhaps they were thinking of ramming as an option.</p>
