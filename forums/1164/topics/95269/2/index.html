            <div class='col-md body'>Well,the round when fired spins as twists/grooves are specially cut into the barrel of the weapon,this is known as Rifling.the typical M-16S1 has approx. 7 twists in its barrel.The need for this is to give the round a straight and more or less flat trajectory and accuracy.A smooth-bore weapon(one w/o rifling) will have a shorter range and is also less accurate.<br><br>Hope this answers your question. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>for example, taurus got 'grooves' dat cause the bullet to rotate prior to leaving the barrel, dat cause the bullet to spin, causing more pene power. bullet's trajectory is similar to projectile motion loh.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>The spin is not to flatten the trajectory, not to enhance penetration, and certainly was not meant to inflict the kind of damage to tissue that are synonymous with M-16 wounds we are all told since the day we asked our intructors.<br><br>The rifling imparts a spin to stabilize the trajectory by maintaining the rotation axis of the round to prevent tumbling, something that affects trajectory stability and ultimately accuracy.

The default is where you aim is where the round will land at 25m and 220m. At ranges closer than 25m it starts lower (that's why the canadain bull is higher at 25m and closer at 100m for zeoring), this is to compensate for the ballistic path of the bullet.<br>see Figure 2-43 at <a href="http://198.65.138.161/military/library/policy/army/fm/3-22-9/c02.htm#2_1" rel="nofollow">http://198.65.138.161/military/library/policy/army/fm/3-22-9/c02.htm#2_1</a><br><br>(ii) see <a href="http://www.snipersparadise.com/wound/wrong.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.snipersparadise.com/wound/wrong.htm</a><br><br>(iii) its properly described as 1 twist every 12 inches. the bullet travels at 990m/sec hence your 4 or 5 turns rotates the bullet per second. see previous point.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>anyway our m-16s1 has the old rifling for the old m193 ball round, if i am right we have both the m855 and the old m193 ball rounds in use. The m855 is of course a better round with more penetration power and greater stability</div>
