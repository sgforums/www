            <div class='col-md body'>The worst part of their NS is the fact it is not universal. Those that served their NS will come to resent those that did not. Given the incidence of corruption in Malaysia (not a bash on the country, just an observation), they will need to worry even more about "white horses" and "draft dodgers". The resentment caused in the US over the selective draft during the Vietnam war, especially when influential or rich families could get their kids out of the draft, is a warning. Our own controversy over WHs is another. A national obligation like NS must be universal and fair in its application. Otherwise it will create even more division, and no one will take it seriously, defeating its entire purpose. It may help that their NS is relatively short and undemanding, with little risk of injury or death (unlike the Vietnam war, and to an extent our own NS), but even that small price to pay will burn if others don't need to pay it.</div>
