Its interesting.<br><br>I agree that the Ultra are fast growing obsolete, they should be decommissioned and kept in storage for the Reservists when the BXII gradually takes over its place. The Bronco did very well in terms of speed, versatility, AI comfort and maybe even better armour than the M113.However, i have doubts that the Infantry carrier version of Bronco is a good replacement as it lacks firepower.

            <div class='col-md body'>I was thinking the Mortar varaint of the Bronco, why dun they make a better design for the mortar carriage itself. I mean it looks like the old typical 120mm mortar for M113. U see, if they make a more roofed and thicker armoured protection for the carriage, it should be better. Just like the AMOS mortar system mounted on the Finnish patria 8x8. The bomb is fed into the tube from the bottom not like the conventional way, thus the crew is very much protected, not like the Bronco. Another thing is why the SRAMS system, why is the bomb placed on the mehcanical slot and then raised to be fed into the tube? I mean wad advantage is there comparing the mechanical arm and the lifting by human?<br><br>The SRAMS has lots of advantages for the infantry and guards. Bcos the mortar has very low recoil thus it can be fitted on top of those 4x4</div>
