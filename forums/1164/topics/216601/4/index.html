However, a Canadian infantry battalion consists of three or four rifle companies identified by letter (A Company, B Company, etc), a Combat Support Company, and an Administration Support Company. A notable exception is The Royal Canadian Regiment which names its companies sequentially throughout the regiment from the Duke of Edinburgh's Company (instead of A Company) in the 1st Battalion to Z Company in the 4th Battalion.<br><br>The Combat Support Company administratively contains the specialized infantry platoons such as Recce Platoon, Pioneer Platoon, HQ and Signals Platoon, Anti-Armour Platoon, and Mortar Platoon. The Administration Support Company contains the support tradesmen which a battalion requires, such as cooks, vehicle technicians, supply, medics, etc.<br><br>[edit] United States Army<br>In the United States military, infantry companies are usually made up of three rifle platoons and a heavy weapons platoon; tank companies are usually made up of three tank platoons and a command element. An infantry company is usually commanded by an army captain. By tradition, the corresponding unit of artillery is always called a "battery." The term "troop" was historically used for horse cavalry, and is sometimes retained for armored units.<br><br>Organic companies, which are not separate from their parent battalion, are identified by letter - for example, "A Company, 1st Battalion, 15th Rifle Regiment". The letters are usually pronounced using the NATO phonetic alphabet or, before that, the Joint Army/Navy Phonetic Alphabet, resulting in names such as "Bravo Company" and "Echo Company" (formerly "Baker" and "Easy" Companies, respectively). Companies with a separate Table of Organization and Equipment are identified by a number, and are able to operate completely independently from any other unit's support. Company-sized units which are organized under a Table of Distribution and Allowance are identified with a name.<br><br>Company-sized units usually consist of four to six platoons (each commanded by a Lieutenant), although there are examples of Combat Service and Combat Service Support companies that have seven or more platoons. For example, a Transportation Terminal Service Company normally has two Ship Platoons, two Shore Platoons, one Documentation Platoon, one Maintenance Platoon, and the Headquarters Platoon. These platoons are commanded by First Lieutenants, while the company is commanded by a Major.<br><br>There are some special units that have platoons commanded by Captains, such as some aviation platoons and many special forces units. This is not a punishment, but rather an honor, as those platoons usually have some special operational capacity that requires them to be commanded by an officer with more experience than a Lieutenant. A Captain reports to his commander, usually the battalion commander (a Lieutenant Colonel). However, there are some administrative and other duties at battalion level and larger (brigade or division) which are also handled by Captains, for example the S-1 through S-4 officers of a battalion, or some staff positions in the G shops at division<br><br>A company is typically commanded by a Captain, although there are certain Combat Service and Combat Service Support companies that are large enough, and specially configured to require the command of a Major. The senior non commissioned officer of a company is called a First Sergeant, and this job is always assigned to an NCO who holds the First Sergeant rank.<br><br>[edit] United States Marine Corps<br>A Marine Corps rifle company consists of:<br><br>three rifle platoons<br>a weapons platoon<br>a Navy corpsman<br>an administrative clerk<br>a police sergeant (typically holding the rank of corporal or sergeant)<br>a training NCO<br>a Company Gunnery Sergeant<br>a First Sergeant<br>an Executive Officer (XO), typically a First Lieutenant<br>a Commanding Officer (CO), typically a Captain<br>A weapons company has in place of the three rifle platoons, an 81 mm mortar platoon, an anti-armor platoon, and a heavy machine gun platoon.<br><br>The following depicts the structure of a headquarters and support company: Headquarters platoon consists of Marines from S-1, S-2, S-3, and the Nuclear, Biological, Chemical Defense section. Next is the H&amp;S Communications platoon, consisting of Radiomen, Wiremen, Techs, Data Marines, and the associated staff. Next is Service platoon, comprised of S-4, Motor Transportation, and Supply. The last platoon in H&amp;S Company is the Battalion Aid Station, or BAS. The BAS is staffed entirely by Navy Corpsman.<br></div>
