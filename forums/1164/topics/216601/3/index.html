Higher rate of fire and more intense firepower does not compensate for less men. One of the key factors is attrition. Simple maths....  say the SAF section of 7 men with their firepower can kill the enemy at a ratio of 3:2 , i.e. for each of our troops killed, 1.5 of the enemy is killed.

However, with visibility lacking in the jungle, a larger frontage would also present problems with communication to the section.<br><br>True, strong flankers force the opponent to shrink into the centre.  Thats where the firepower we have come in.<br><br>Finally, a larger section may also be harder to deploy in the jungle as well. 7men by 5 meters seperation, would cover 30 meters across.  Sometimes, we may not even see up to 30 meters!  In a 10-11 man section, would the section commander be able to appreciate the situation for a 50 meter front and make good decisions out of it?<br><br>I believe the 7 man section has its pro-s and cons.  Fighting in our region, its either plantation, jungle or urban.  Since plantation would undoubtedly have adequate armor support, the jungle and urban areas would be the only place where the infantry is tested.  Urban warfare is another whole new ball game.</div>

Higher rate of fire and more intense firepower does not compensate for less men. One of the key factors is attrition. Simple maths....  say the SAF section of 7 men with their firepower can kill the enemy at a ratio of 3:2 , i.e. for each of our troops killed, 1.5 of the enemy is killed. The enemy section of 11 men, will outlast our section of 7 ! Simple maths !<br><br>Also, with more troops , in a static battle, your frontage is wider. From historical events, the side with the larger frontage is going to have many options of outflanking ( or turning the flanks) of the narrower side. It's jsut like football. If your flankers are strong, the other side will be forever be forced into a defensive game, always shrinking towards the centre to protect being outflanked and by-passed.</div></blockquote>Don't understand our SAF young policy maker. Reduce manpower thru compensate in increase firepower, this may sound right in mathematic &amp; in perfect assumption. How come they never consider casualty in any operation before actual contact with red force, by then does it mean we still have the same fire power or man power to complete the job?</div>

This happens by adjusting the angle and power of the shots and carefully calculating the time between the shots. The first rounds are shot with higher angles and loads of propellant so that the rounds fly a high arc. The next rounds are shot a couple of seconds afterwards with a slightly smaller angle and with less gunpowder so that they fly a lower arc but fly as far as the first rounds. This can be done seven times in a row, always adjusting the angle and power, so that the result is that all the 14 rounds hit the target simultaneously. <strong>The adjustment between the shots is done by a computer.</strong> The strike of one AMOS unit roughly equals one strike of an artillery battery. </blockquote>Note: All the above system are turreted and the AMOS and NEMO have direct fire mode.<br><br>So far , SRAMS never mentioned abt MRSI capability but it does come with FCS computer, it could theoretically calculate  based on distance from target, the charges required, the elevation and timing for each subsequent rd to achieve MRSI , perhaps 2~3 rds MRSI capability.<br><br>Comments???<br></div>
