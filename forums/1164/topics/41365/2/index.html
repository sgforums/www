If we look at coutries like Israel, Egypt and UAE, they are only armed with about 40 apaches. Hence, if they these countries face armour in such huge numbers and only have 40 of them, malaysian armoured brigades would not be too much for Saf to handle. </blockquote>i agree... but i think there is some misconception about the role about the apaches in what we're saying... 20 is enough for us for now because the apaches are not meant to act alone... not unless u use them like the israelis sometimes... to chase palestinian terrorists and blow them up with hellfire... a bit overkill if u ask me  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br><br>judging by the latest ops in iraq, the apaches are used to support ground troops, who have good AT elements as well... ATGMs and MBTs. hence, it complements and enhances AT existing capabilities, not replace it.<br><br><blockquote>In addition, if we want to get the MAF's armoured vehicles out of the way, we still have the bion1x 25 with the 25mm bushmaster cannon</blockquote>at best, that will only disable APCs and IFVs... it won't take out a tank... the best way to take out a tank in a tank vs tank battle, is either to dismount troops to shoot ATGM, or to use another tank.<br><br>just for info, people in armour will know that during exercises, bionix are not used to engage an enemy tank.<br></div>

These are the most modern tanks in the world as they have various sub-systems from European countries and suited to Malaysia," he said after witnessing the signing of the contract for the purchase of the tanks and support vehicles.<br></strong></blockquote>Unfortunately the PT-91s are just a polish rehash on the old T-72, tanks which got fragged like crazy in the gulf wars one and two, without being able to even knock out a single enemy tank in return. Chances are, and likely are, that the PT-91 isn't going to be remotely anywhere near the most modern tank in the world unless the PT-91 upgrade provides revolutionary capabilities that are unheard of in the T-72. Given their price tag, anything which is affordable by malaysia, this is probably not the case.<br><br>What on earth do they need a NBC system for? Nipah virus?</div>

MBTs remain unsuitable for use in the regions terrain, with the Russian T-72 series (of which the PT-91 is a member) being the lightest, tipping the scales at 40+ tons.<br><br>What Singapore needs is a new class of tank, with sufficient firepower to match today's MBTs yet with sufficient mobility to traverse the unique demands of regional terrain. I might be speculating, but something has to give and armour protection would likely suffer(in varying degrees) as a result with the resulting slack in protection be taken up by electronic protection methods.<br><br>Thats the very reason why Singapore is going ahead with developing its own light tank. And that, IMO is a good move, even if it utilises mostly COTS technologies/parts as local industries have not reached the standards nor critical mass being present to justify developing it entirely from the ground up.</div>

The fact that the T-72 behind could still be penetrated from the front by a already demassed and deformed penetrator means two things.

            <div class='col-md body'>It's not really surprising... the gulf T-72s lacked reactive armor (though it effectiveness is dubious against TOW 2B) and Abrams and Bradleys could take them out with HEAT warheads from 120mm guns and TOW missiles.<br><br>To make things worse for the iraqis, a lot of them were firing training sabot rounds against rounds against the americans! The 125mm can't even penetrate using real stuff and they bothered to hurl training rounds at it (usually cost 1/3- 1/10 the cost of the real stuff). Needless to say, they did little good but to attract the attention of the americans, who deftly returned with real stuff...<br><br>The PT-91 is a rehash of the T-72, better engine and stuff... but little fundemental has changed...</div>

It had a gas turbine, laser range finder and stuff like that, along with a very short profile. Unforuntately it was not a great sucess becos it did not provide as much a bang for the buck then the T-72 did. Later versions of the T-80 removed some of the high tech features they attempted to copy from the Abrams and were made to be cheaper, rather then to be quality material. Though armor has been improved somewhat, it still remains in all areas clearly quite inferior to that of the M1A1 onwards series.<br><br>That's why the russians produced their T-90, which was actually aa souped-up T-72 that allowed them more bang-for-buck then their T-80 series, which they are trying to export.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>To Singapore Macross<br><br>One of the things that our dear northern neighbour is good at is flogging off its palm oil stocks. Its a very good way for them to make purchases without hurting their economy too much.<br><br>They started this with the russians with the migs not too long ago. Then the French Subs and now the Polish Tanks. Let me not focus on the military side but rather on the economic ones.<br><br>Just say 50% of the 400m is in oil palm and textiles. (not rubber) Assume that it is 150m palm oil and 50m textiles. What can Poland do with 150m worth of palm oil? They can either sell it to someone else or use it themselves.<br><br>Firstly, it has to be shipped there (if they plan on using it) .. So more contracts for crude palm oil carrier ships. (Malaysia shipping company gains)<br><br>Then, what can be made out of palm oil? Plastics, Cosmetics, Shampoo, Detergent. That means, that either some MNC or some Malaysian company (like Lam Soon) will go there to build a factory to make the stuff. Hence, more trade.<br><br>Then, once the factory is set up, it will continually need palm oil to function .. more exports for Malaysia. Poland gains by exporting end result like shampoo, detergent, cosmetics and plastics .. those everyday products are needed all over the world so there is plenty of profit to be made by polish companies.<br><br>Assuming Poland exports part of that 150m worth of palm oil, whichever country buys it will follow seps 1-3 as well.<br><br>Then there is the additional benefit of hitting the American Soybean Oil producers. America is the worlds largest producer and a sworn enemy of Canada's Canola Oil and Malaysia's Palm Oil. This will definately dampen demand for Soybean oil in the world as Poland will try to flood the oil market with as much excess Palm Oil as possible. Malaysia does not mind as supposedly, its their replanting season so its supply is low at the moment. (Malaysia only sells palm oil for weapons on every second or third year I noticed)<br><br>Lastly, when there is 150m worth of palm oil sold, that is 150m DIRECTLY into the Malaysian economy (or rather the big palm oil companies like Sime Darby, IOI, etc), and those companies will invest the money and pay the government in tax. So its +150m rather than -150m out of Malaysian budget. Of course, the worst scenario for Malaysia will be that Poland sell all 150m to India, who will use it as they already have the factories.<br><br>But remember, Malaysia also have shipped 100s of millions worth of palm oil over to Russia and France, who will be probably either using it (unlikely) or selling/donating it to African countries. The greedy Malaysian companies will still be able to track where the palm oil goes and repeat steps 1-3 to any country that has the palm oil.<br><br>So its a very sneaky way of getting the weapons and creating a new market.<br><br>For the textiles, Malaysia still has lots of clothing factories in Batu Pahat .. 50m worth of Orlando, Pepper, GQ and ELBA clothes are going to Poland, who can start new markets for the Malaysians.</div>

I am train in anti tank weapon and basically, we do not operate alone. we operate in a section of 2 team, each team operate on firing post.<br><br>In the case if we were to encounter a convoy of tanks, the SOP will be for one team to enagage  the tank at the very front and the other team fire at the tank at the rear. In this way, the rest of the tanks in between will be trapped. We will then take out the rest of those in between depending on the situation.<br><br>even if we fail to knock all the tanks, we would have hinder their advance. Previously, this would be quite a risky operations with Milan bcause of the limited range(1950m) which put us within the firing range of the tank gun.  With Spike, this opraetion will be less risky due to the long range and more importantly, the gunner do not need to expose themselve when firing.</div>
