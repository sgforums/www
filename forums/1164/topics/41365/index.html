The negotiations lasted many months. An important part of them applied to compensation that the Malaysians demand for the tanks and accompanying equipment they are ready to buy.<br><br>As part of the offset program, the Malaysians would want some of the tank and component production to be moved to Malaysia. The settlement for the arms deliveries would be made in cash and barter trade. As payment, Poland would accept palm oil and textiles that could be re-exported, among other products. In the future, the end assembly of the tanks could take place in Malaysia. Poland would also want to sell the Malaysians ammunition production technology.<br><br>Miller said that if the program succeeded, there was a chance to expand the Malaysian order to include further batches of equipment worth $200 million.<br><br>The Hard tank offered to Malaysia will be fitted with air-conditioning, a powerful 1,000-hp engine from PZL Wola and fire targeting systems from France's SAGEM company.<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;"></span></div>

T'was a little addition made by the author of the article.

Tim Huxley also quoted this number.<br><br>I tend to agree with you. SAF needs an MBT - not too heavy, not to many though. As I have said in other posts, Leclerc seems to be the ideal MBT in my opinion for our region. Not to heavy, not too big, 3 man crew with an advanced autoloader, good fire-control system, one of the most agile and fastest MBT, good armour, active and passive defensive aid suite, etc. Korean K1 is, IMO, only equivalent to a base M1 (with a 120mm gun). If SAF is to adopt K1, then we need quite a few assistance from the Israeli to help us improve the tank defensive aid including add-on armour and defensive aid suite, and a battlefield management system similar to that used in M1A2  and Mekarva 4 .<br><br>I also cannot stress enough that Singapore needs more than 20 attack helo. At least another 20 is needed to give SAF a distinctive edge for the near future. As I have proposed in other thread, the next 20 doesn't need to be Longbow Apaches or even Ah-64D. AH-1Z, A129 or the South African Roovialk would suffice.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I wonder where the armour instructors for the MAF come from? All the best to them - afterall, they do have a disadvantage when facing the Thais in the North and us in the South, and they are converting from a counter-insurgency force to a conventional force.<br><br>We shouldn't be worried - we have operated armoured units for 30 years already. Experience contributed by our advisors.(foreign talents?). Anti-Tank capablity is of no issue here. I've read in other forums how some amatures compare the PT91M with the AMX13. In the South-East Asian context of jungle/urban terrain - tanks, in my opinion, will not see tank vs tank battles. You do not need a tank to kill another tank. Anybody who serve in the military before would know this clearly.<br><br>As for the Centurions - they have been around for some time, and will likely to be replaced. I'm not too sure about Mindef releasing details though. There is a lot of discussions going around other forums about tanks (MBT) operating in urban environments. I'm quite sure the foreign talents will share their experience.<br><br>ST has openly said that they are developing a new light tank based on the components from the Bionix. It would be nice if its shown during the next Asian Aerospace exhibition in 2004.<br><br>And the Apache, I think the numbers will grow to between 40-60 depending on manpower (pilots) and budget.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Actually I doubt Singapore has lost its edge over Malaysia as of yet.  The tanks will be delivered in 2006.  They will still need time to train crews in its use and tactics.<br><br>Singapore already has Apaches in its ownership, there are already 21 apache pilots certified mission capable since the last time there was news.<br><br>The PT-91 is a tank, the Apache is called a tank buster for a reason.<br><br>If Singapore decides to get more Apaches in future, the Apaches can probably be delivered and be put into use very fast, as long as they train enough pilots on the current ones.<br><br>But even if Apaches are bought Singapore still desperately needs a light tank replacement.  Malaysia has hundreds of armoured fighting vehicles, i doubt these can be disabled by Singapore's own APCs, the AMX-13s are the one left with the job in the army's current orbat. (it'll be damn expensive to use apaches for everything)<br><br>the prob with anti-tank missiles is, if armoured vehicles are travelling in pairs or more, you are screwed big time after u fire your anti-tank missile, the vehicles left will get u, and even if u are facing on vehicle with an anti-tank vehicle, u better pray like nuts u hit it after u fire, cos ur position will be revealed. . .unless you are firing from an APC at another apc of course, but then you'd have to stick ur head out and fire, while the enemy is shooting at you. . .unless he hasn't spotted you yet, which would be unlikely given the built up areas and forest grounds in these region do not allow for very long range of sight.  anti-tank missiles will only give infantry sections a CHANCE against AFVs, they should NOT be used as the main weapon against the AFVs, you'll lose an infantry section for every enemy AFV u get, assuming none of your missile miss. . .<br><br>basically, singapore still needs those light tanks. . . anti-tank missiles and small numbers of attack choppers are NOT the method to use against large numbers of AFVs<br><br>my two cents. .  i happened to be wondering, 'okay, so you fire off an anti-tank missile, but what happens after that?'  then i realised, you are the one screwed after u fire ur missile</div>

If you cannot get a clear shot, neither can your opponent.

If we look at coutries like Israel, Egypt and UAE, they are only armed with about 40 apaches. Hence, if they these countries face armour in such huge numbers and only have 40 of them, malaysian armoured brigades would not be too much for Saf to handle. In addition, if we want to get the MAF's armoured vehicles out of the way, we still have the bionex 25 with the 25mm bushmaster cannon</div>
