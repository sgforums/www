              <p>NEWS COMMENT<br><em><strong>Air force muscle keeps s’pore safe</strong></em></p>
              <p>http://www.todayonline.com/pdf_main.asp?pubdate=20080829</p>
              <p>The RSA F has a long-range strike capability as well<br>as solid defence system .Tim Huxley.</p>
              <p><br>AIR power is a key component of military<br>capability, and since the 1960s, Singapore’s<br>defence planners have put great effort<br>into developing this city-state’s air force,<br>which celebrates its 40th anniversary this<br>weekend.</p>
              <p><br>Four decades of effort have paid strategic<br>dividends: The Republic of Singapore<br>Air Force (RSAF) is vital in maintaining<br>the island’s security. Singapore’s defence<br>partners regard it highly.</p>
              <p><br>Although Singapore’s leaders apparently<br>had plans for an air force from the time they<br>began thinking about how to defend the new<br>state in the immediate wake of separation<br>from Malaysia, it was only after Britain announced<br>it would be accelerating its military<br>withdrawal from Singapore in 1968 that<br>development of the Singapore Air Defence<br>Command or SADC (as the RSAF was known<br>until 1975) began in earnest.<br>Singapore’s air power build-up was<br>rapid. Early SADC recruits were trained in<br>Britain, which was also the source for much<br>of the fledgling air arm’s equipment.<br>By the early 1970s, the SADC had taken<br>over the four British air bases at Changi,<br>Seletar, Sembawang and Tengah, together<br>with the crucial air defence radar station at<br>Bukit Gombak.<br>By the 1980s, the RSAF had received<br>substantial numbers of United Statesbuilt<br>combat and transport aircraft, and<br>helicopters. These boosted its capacity to<br>defend Singapore’s airspace and to move<br>troops and equipment. But it was always<br>clear that, because it lacked strategic depth,<br>Singapore needed to deter enemies by possessing<br>the capacity to take the war to an<br>aggressor’s territory.</p>
              <p><br>Air power, specifically the RSAF’s substantial<br>fleet of upgraded former US Navy<br>attack aircraft supported by an embryonic<br>in-flight refuelling capability, provided a<br>crucial means of doing this.</p>
              <p><br><span style="color: #ff0000;">Over the last decade, the RSAF has<br>developed capabilities that — at least, in<br>theory — place it in the same category as<br>the air forces of smaller Western countries<br>such as Australia and the Netherlands.</span><br>The latest models of F-16C and D multirole<br>combat aircraft — some operating from<br>the new air base at Changi East — have<br>replaced the old A-4 Skyhawks, enhancing<br>Singapore’s deterrent by providing a precision,<br>long-range strike capability as well as<br>improving its air defences.</p>
              <p><br>KC-135 in-flight refuelling aircraft have<br>expanded the RSAF’s capability for longrange<br>operations. In addition, Apache attack<br>helicopters allow the RSAF to provide close<br>air support for army operations much more<br>effectively. Large Chinook helicopters have<br>expanded battlefield airlift for troops and<br>equipment. Unmanned air vehicles (UAVs)<br>have become key elements of joint-service<br>operations, providing vital reconnaissance<br>and targeting data for the army.<br>The RSAF also supports the navy with<br>maritime patrol aircraft, and will soon fly<br>well-armed Seahawk helicopters on antiship<br>and anti-submarine missions from<br>navy frigates.<br>All this is in line with the 3G (Third<br>Generation) SAF concept, which prioritises<br>development of network-centric forces with<br>greatly improved firepower to compensate<br>for Singapore’s lack of geographical hinterland<br>and relatively small population.</p>
              <p><br>Mindef has restructured the RSAF to<br>allow more effective use of its assets in<br>‘networked’ joint-service operations which<br>stress rapid sharing of intelligence and surveillance<br>data and precision targeting.<br>Five new functional commands have<br>replaced the previous structure in which air<br>bases were the main organisational units.<br>For example, Air Defence and Operations<br>Command — the air force’s “highreadiness<br>core” — will oversee peacetime<br>operational commitments, Participation<br>Command will focus on air-land operations<br>and Air Power Generation Command will<br>supervise air base operations.</p>
              <p><br>The RSAF will soon benefit from important<br>new equipment. Gulfstream G550<br>airborne early warning aircraft will replace<br>the present E-2 Hawkeyes, providing muchimproved<br>surveillance and control of air operations.<br>Hermes 450 UAVs will also allow a<br>quantum leap in reconnaissance capability.<br>Twenty-four F-15SG Eagles — the ultimate<br>and most capable version of this<br>proven combat aircraft — will significantly<br>improve long-range strike capabilities.<br>In the longer-term, F-35 Joint Strike<br>Fighters designed for networked warfare<br>will expand the RSAF’s ability to disable<br>enemy forces, while new long-range air<br>defence systems may be able to protect<br>Singapore from potential missile attacks.<br>Benefitting from good equipment, highly-<br>educated personnel and extensive overseas<br>training and exercises, there is no doubt<br>the RSAF is a highly professional force.<br>Although it has deployed support aircraft<br>to assist security partners in Iraq and<br>Afghanistan, it remains true that it lacks<br>major operational experience.</p>
              <p><br>Hopefully, it will remain the case that<br>its real worth lies in helping to prevent conflict<br>by deterring potential adversaries.<br>The writer is the executive director of<br>the International Institute for Strategic<br>Studies – Asia, the Singapore-based wing of<br>the independent security think-tank, the IIS .</p>

              <p>There is no such word as "hitted".</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>And you never heard of this thing called electronic warfare and standoff munitions that can mess up your "shoot and scoot in 4 minutes" assumptions ah? While we may have one of the the densest air defence coverage in the world we are also limited by the fact that we are basically fighting from a very small island, and the enemy does not really need to aim anywhere to hit something.</p>

              <p>then why they are spend A$6 billion in  2007 to buy Super Hornets</p>
              <p>just for INTERIM purposes?The cant wait the F35 come!!</p>
              <p>The best is no need to buy new tankers at all,if no body</p>
              <p>will come to attack.</p>
              <p>But u cant expect enemy will not come when u have only ONE</p>
              <p>uncertified tanker!!</p>
              <p>Also,they are seriously considering to buy 100 or 50 F35!!</p>
              <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>JORN super radar</strong></span></p>
              <p>It this one will help to deter,track and lock in enemy,</p>
              <p>then why should oz need to rush to buy Super Hornets and</p>
              <p>to buy F35??</p>
              <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">The attitudes to defence and mode/delay of acquisitiond </span></strong></span></p>
              <p>I find Oz is not serious in defense in reality.</p>
              <p>Some times,like Super Hornets,they were too rush to decide.</p>
              <p>Some times,like air tanker,they are too late to act.</p>
              <p>On paper,oz can tell u they are under threats of rising PRC etc</p>
              <p>As at today,(dunt tell me the heaven in the future),</p>
              <p>there is only one air tanker can take off from oz soil,though it is</p>
              <p>not certified to fly.</p>
              <p>Financially,technologically,and politically they can acquire new air tankers</p>
              <p>on time,before the old platforms retire one by one,and the last</p>
              <p>one retired this year.The old tankers did not retire suddenly.</p>
              <p>Oz can foresee the retirement schedule,but they act too late.</p>
              <p>I find Oz are always bullied by US defense suppliers,</p>
              <p>like in the ill fated Navy heli!!</p>
              <p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">Now Anzac Class frigate do not has heli to use and NOT </span></span></strong></p>
              <p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">to be protected </span></span></strong>by the heli ASW capacity!!</p>
              <p>Kaman <a class="new" href="http://www.navy.gov.au/w/index.php/Seasprite">Seasprite</a> helicopters upgrade failed and all the birds</p>

              <p>u can say ANZAC still have other ASW gears.</p>

              <p>If the Australians are worried about defence then mid air refueling is not an issue, because they will be fighting from home ground advantage. Instead of wasting time and fuel on constant CAP they can use JORN to scramble and direct their aircraft as and when they need.</p>
              <p>It is the agressor against them who will need to worried about air to air refueling, not them.</p>
              <p>In fact, they fact they want a serious air-to-air refueling capacity means that have intentions to PROJECT their airpower. </p>
              <p>The fact they are not getting our two-bit KC-135 and waiting for a better model is proof that they intend to have some serious regional power-projection capacity, something that the SAF cannot even dream to boast about.</p>
              <p>Something that seems to be lost on you.</p>
              <p>In fact if you studied the moves of the Australians carefully you'll realize that a lot of the points you try to raise actually backfire on you.</p>

              <p>For the reasons above, they decided to play the waiting game for obvious reasons. The duh factor on this is so astounding I am surprised you can mess this up.</p>
              <p>Let's see they had a choice:</p>
              <p>Option A: Go lionnoisy "anyday, anyhow" war can break out panic and buy old KC-135s for millions of dollars only to need to replace them a bit later down the road.</p>
              <p>Option B: Have some common sense and wait for a far better and modern model to come out.</p>

              <p>Gulfstream AWACS vs Wedgetails? Oh please, there's no comparison here. Gulfstreams are piss weak minijets vs a full sized plane. Which one will carry more electronics?</p>

              <h3>Challenging Integration Task</h3>
              <p>Being the first of its
              class, the Australian Wedgetail has encountered significant integration
              challenges that caused at least three years delay. As of July 2008, the
              system has not been declared operational. The problems are believed to
              be related to the intergation and performance of the radar, datalinks
              and electronic support measures. as well as software and hardware
              modifications. Fixes included engineering changes to the 'Top Hat'
              structure, were introduced as early as 2006 but until 2008 the program
              hasn't stabilized yet. Delivery of the first two aircraft is scheduled
              for July 2009. In July 2008 Boeing announced that the first two
              aircraft, equipped with the electronic warfare suite (but not the main
              radar or ESM) will be ready in early 2010, soon to be followed by the
              other four, to be delivered with full capability in 2010. The delay was
              the main reason for $248 million write-off announced by Boeing on the
              Second Quarter of 2008.</p>

              <p>LOL...</p>
              <p>and lionnoisy ...</p>
              <p>ask why SQ bought the A380 and is their launch customer when there are so many problems with the air conditioning and reliability with the aircraft.</p>
              <p>and we are the first customer for the G550 as well. we are getting it at the same as our isareli friends. our systems havent even arrived and been intergreated with our kits yet. we may yet have issues.</p>
              <p>dont jump the gun and shoot yourself in the foot before you type your random rubbish.</p>
              <p>AEW&amp;C is a complicated thing. you realise how many subsystems are there to be intergreated ? how many AWACs manufacturer do you know ? AFAIK, there's only 3, Israel , Sweden (saab erieye) and the good Ole USA.</p>
              <p>and almost every western aircraft project  (military) has been delayed, overbudget or threatened with cancellation at some point in the project. big furry deal with the Wedgetail being late.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>too scared of being pwned by sg tyrannosaurus so now running all over to other subforums and other old threads to post is it ?</p>
