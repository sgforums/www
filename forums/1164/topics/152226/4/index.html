Of course, that is assuming that what you implied was true, and that u're not just another WANNABE posting those, "I'm from a super sensitive/classified/ bullsh!t unit,  I'll tell but I'll have to kill you" messages.<br><br>So mr."pilot."  You wanna shoot straight now?<br><br>luv<br>"Kid"<br><br></div></blockquote>Gee wiz... thanks for showing us your worth, "Kid".<br><br>1.  i only called you a 'kid' as a matter speech; not literally.  however, u seem dogmatically insistent in showing what a 'kid you really are.  u dun seem to understand the pointers that were provided while others did.  neither were you able to research your facts properly before firing your shot regarding your irritability and war-junkie "bloodiness".  in any case, your lack of tolerance and your last post does you credit in proving your level of maturity, no?  Go on, kid.  live in your blissful world of Gundams, VF-1Js and flight sims, while the rest of us continue in a mature factual discussion.<br><br>2.  i never claimed or implied to be anything.  i've always said i let facts speak for themselves while u assumed.  those who know will know.  those who dun, well... you make a very good case of not knowing....<br><br>3.  first off, what the heck are you trying to say by "u dun have even give a thought"???  anyway, i never said anything abt not giving "a thought to superbugs and flankers" ... i said "I wouldnt even worry excessively".  worrying excessively and not giving a thought as you claim are 2 very different matters entirely.  your claim abt not giving a thought is flippant complacency.  i said "i wouldnt worry excessively" cos when pilots are up in the air, there are other things to worry abt besides air threats.  sure, i worry abt the aggresors whom i may have to face; i did say that the Superbug's a good bird did i not?  But if a pilot worried excessively abt air threats only and loses focus on the sortie, what do you think would be the result?  again, pls get your facts right.<br><br>4.  abt the MKM, if you knew our kill ratio during SINDEX 04 despite the ROEs imposed on us, then you'll know why i made my statement regarding MKMs.  then again, i doubt you know much... perhaps RussianPower can enlighten you.  afterall, he has "milk powder"  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br><br>5.  u seem to be someone who "go(es) into any situation in life half-!*%*ed and just rely on their instincts to get them out of trouble", so i guess you're jus tokking to yourself then. : )<br><br>6.  "What ticked me off was that flippant attitude of urs. It makes the Air Force looks unprofessional. First thought that crossed my mind was, "wah, our air force got this kinda prick ah?" Of course, that is assuming that what you implied was true, and that u're not just another WANNABE posting those, "I'm from a super sensitive/classified/ bullsh!t unit, I'll tell but I'll have to kill you" messages."<br><br>Do pray tell, Mr wannbe, wat flippant attitude?  you referring to your own flippant complacency and not giving a thought to other aggressors?  pls accord others the professional respect even tho you may have none.  and dun bring in the air force or speak for the service unless you've put your kiddy ass on the line like the rest.<br><br>again, you have assumed and implied.... if, in your opinion, i come across as a wannbe, then so be it.  i leave you to your own assumptions.  I dun have to answer to you and neither do i owe you any.<br><br>If i'm pissing you off, too bad.  it goes to show how matured you are.  stay cool and hang loose!  cheers!</div>
