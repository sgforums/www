The Euro-carnards offer a very good alternative and that's why the industry was watching the RoKAF and RSAF selection so intently.  i hope you find this sufficient to whet your appetite.  to go into the details of each and every single consideration is not only time consuming; it's also unwise of both of us.  agreed?  anyway, like what i said, let events unfold as time passes and let the facts speak for themselves.<br><br>Perhaps you would like share with us why you believe the gripen "has what it takes to take over the F-5s".  I sure we can all learn and benefit from a meaningful exchange of ideas and opinions.<br><br>Viking, feel free to add in your 2 cents (or should it be kroners?) worth as well.<br><br>cheerios!</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Assuming that RSAF acquires another 8 more Strike Eagles, say at 50 mil a pc. Thats another 400mil spent on aircraft.  If they are gonna purchase another aircraft type to replace the F-5 which maybe in the numbers of another 12-20? (in the category of 40-60Mil), might as well just get more F-15SGs.  The F-15SGs are also more than capable replacements for the F-5s.<br><br>Hence, to buy another fighter-type to replace the F-5s in the 40-60mil category just doesn't make sense to me.  And besides, like you mentioned, we would already have the infrastructure, logistics as well as (by then hopefully) operational experience with the Strike Eagles.<br><br>On the otherhand, purchasing a slightly cheaper (30mil) 4th generation aircraft to replace the F-5 would definitely be cheaper, that is looking at the short term aspect.  Like U said, I didn't take into consideration the cost setting up of overseas training bases.  Eg if we were to buy from the swedes initially, say 12?  It'll be a modest 360 mil (not inclusive of additional costs).  We'd have capable interceptors to replace the F-5s, and at lower initial costs.  That was why I asked if it was a performance or capability standard that prevented anyone in the RSAF from even considering the gripen.<br><br>And if the Swede Gov is willing to accede a good deal, why not? Unless it was not as capable as other aircraft the RSAF would eye on later.  But yes, I do get your point about integrating the aircraft into the RSAF's defence strategy, as well as logistics.  I can imagine the logistic situation already...   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_eek.gif" alt="Shocked" title="Shocked"><br><br>What I am unsure about the Gripen is, whether it is "ready."  I looked at some of the sites, it seemed that there is still a lot of development and upgrade packages on the way.  The one that caught my attention was that it lacked in flight refueling capability.  The site may be old.. I hope..</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by Shotgun:</div><div class="quote_body">Assuming that RSAF acquires another 8 more Strike Eagles, say at 50 mil a pc. Thats another 400mil spent on aircraft.  If they are gonna purchase another aircraft type to replace the F-5 which maybe in the numbers of another 12-20? (in the category of 40-60Mil), might as well just get more F-15SGs.  The F-15SGs are also more than capable replacements for the F-5s.<br><br>Hence, to buy another fighter-type to replace the F-5s in the 40-60mil category just doesn't make sense to me.  And besides, like you mentioned, we would already have the infrastructure, logistics as well as (by then hopefully) operational experience with the Strike Eagles.<br><br>On the otherhand, purchasing a slightly cheaper (30mil) 4th generation aircraft to replace the F-5 would definitely be cheaper, that is looking at the short term aspect.  Like U said, I didn't take into consideration the cost setting up of overseas training bases.  Eg if we were to buy from the swedes initially, say 12?  It'll be a modest 360 mil (not inclusive of additional costs).  We'd have capable interceptors to replace the F-5s, and at lower initial costs.  That was why I asked if it was a performance or capability standard that prevented anyone in the RSAF from even considering the gripen.<br><br>And if the Swede Gov is willing to accede a good deal, why not? Unless it was not as capable as other aircraft the RSAF would eye on later.  But yes, I do get your point about integrating the aircraft into the RSAF's defence strategy, as well as logistics.  I can imagine the logistic situation already...   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_eek.gif" alt="Shocked" title="Shocked"><br><br>What I am unsure about the Gripen is, whether it is "ready."  I looked at some of the sites, it seemed that there is still a lot of development and upgrade packages on the way.  The one that caught my attention was that it lacked in flight refueling capability.  The site may be old..
