            <div class='col-md body'>GRIPEN MULTI-ROLE FIGHTER AIRCRAFT, SWEDEN<br>The Gripen multi-role fighter aircraft, developed by Saab, was first flown in December 1988 and entered operational service with the Swedish Air Force in 1997. It is planned that the Gripen will replace all current variants of the Viggen and Draken combat aircraft. Gripen has been developed by an industrial consortium consisting of Saab, Ericsson Microwave Systems, Volvo Aero Corporation, Saab Avionics and FFV Aerotech. A joint venture company, Gripen International, has been set up by Saab and BAE Systems to market the Gripen for export markets. BAE Systems is building the main landing gear unit and wing attachment unit.<br><br>JAS 39A is the single-seater version of the Gripen. A two-seater JAS 39B operational trainer variant of Gripen is available. The JAS 39B is equipped with the same avionics and weapons suite as the JAS 39A, with the exception of the gun. JAS 39C is the single seat Batch 3 and export standard version, which was first delivered to the Swedish Air Force in September 2002. JAS 39C has colour cockpit displays, on-board oxygen generation system (OBOGS) and in-flight refuelling capabilty. JAS 39D will be a similarly upgraded two seater.<br><br>The Swedish Air Force has ordered 204 Gripen (including 28 of the two-seater version) for two operational squadrons, with deliveries continuing till 2007. In November 1998, the South African Air Force ordered 28 Gripen multi-role aircraft (19 single-seat and nine dual-seat). Denel Aviation of South Africa will produce part of the centre fuselage. Deliveries are to begin in 2007. In November 2001, Hungary signed a Memorandum of Understanding for the lease of 14 aircraft - 12 JAS 39A single-seat and two JAS 39B. In February 2003, Sweden and Hungary signed an amendment to the lease contract and both the single seated and the twin seated aircraft will be upgraded to C and D standard. The amendment also says that Hungary will purchase the aircraft after the lease period. Deliveries will begin in 2006.<br><br>In June 2004, the Czech Republic signed a leasing agreement with the Swedish Government for 14 new Gripen (12 single-seat JAS 39C and two two-seat JAS 39D) for a period of ten years. The first six aircraft were delivered in April 2005 and the remainder will be handed over in August 2005.<br><br>From: <a href="http://www.airforce-technology.com/projects/gripen/" rel="nofollow">http://www.airforce-technology.com/projects/gripen/</a></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>WEAPONS</strong><br><br>The Gripen has seven external hardpoints for carrying payloads: one at each wingtip, two under each wing and one on the fuselage centreline.<br><br>The air-to-air missiles include MBDA (formerly Matra BAe Dynamics) MICA, Raytheon AIM-120B AMRAAM and Lockheed Martin/Raytheon Sidewinder AIM-9L (Swedish Air Force Designation RB74). Sidewinder, mounted on the wingtips, is an all-aspect attack, short-range missile for enhanced dogfight capability. Air-to-surface missiles include the radar-guided Saab RBS15F anti-ship missile and Raytheon Maverick missile. Later versions of the aircraft for Sweden will be armed with the short-range BGT IRIS-T air-to-air missile and the MBDA Meteor Beyond Visual Range (BVR) air-to-air missile. IRIS-T is scheduled to enter service in 2005 and Meteor in 2010. The Saab Bofors/MBDA Taurus KEPD 350 long-range standoff missile, with a range of 350km, has been successfully flight tested on the Gripen.<br><br>The internally mounted 27mm Mauser high-energy gun can operate in an automatic radar-guided aiming mode. The stand-off dispenser is the DWF39 from EADS (formerly DaimlerChrysler Aerospace) and Bofors. The Bofors ARAK 70 rocket pod is cleared for carriage on the Gripen.<br><br><strong>COUNTERMEASURES</strong><br><br>Saab Avionics is responsible for the EWS 39 electronic warfare suite, which has been ordered by the Swedish Air Force. EWS 39 is an integrated EW system that provides radar warning, electronic support measures and chaff and flare decoy dispensers.<br><br><strong>SENSORS</strong><br><br>The Ericsson PS-05 long-range multi-purpose pulse Doppler radar has air-to air operating modes covering long-range search, multi-target track-while-scan, multiple priority target tracking, air combat quick search modes, raid assessment and beyond visual range (BVR) missile mid-course updates. The air-to-surface modes include long-range search/target identification, multiple priority target tracking, high-resolution, real beam mapping, air-to-surface ranging and Doppler beam sharpening (DBS).<br><br>The aircraft is equipped with a forward-looking infrared (FLIR) sensor and will have the Saab IR-Otis infrared search and track system (IRST).<br><br>Nine Swedish Air Force Gripens are being fitted with the SaabTech Modular Reconnaissance Pod, which includes a Recon/Optical CA270 infrared sensor. The system will enter service in 2006.<br><br><strong>COMMUNICATIONS</strong><br><br>The aircraft has VHF/UHF transmitters and receivers from SaabTech Vectronics, and a Thales TSC 2000 identification friend or foe (IFF) system. An air-to-air data link allows real-time exchange of tactical data within and between co-operating air units. In the attack and reconnaissance role, the data link allows radar-derived surface data to be transferred from one Gripen to a group of radar-silent attacking aircraft.<br><br><strong>ENGINE</strong><br><br>The RM12engine, supplied by Volvo Aero, is a development of the GE F404 engine from General Electric. A digital engine control system automatically monitors the engine parameters and automatically switches on the back-up systems if required. A condition monitoring system registers the flight data. The air-to-air refuelling probe is retracted into the aircraft to retain the aerodynamic profile. The longer flight times achieved by using air-to-air refuelling results in the pilot needing a larger oxygen supply, so an on-board oxygen generating system (OBOGS) has been installed.<br><br>From: <a href="http://www.airforce-technology.com/projects/gripen/" rel="nofollow">http://www.airforce-technology.com/projects/gripen/</a><br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>JAS39 is a good plane. But from the tech spec, you can see that this plane is a bit underpower when compare to the PLAAF J10 and J17. Thus, we can expect the JAS39 to face stiff competition in Africa, SE Asia &amp; South Asia markets in 2006. JAS39 has every good features to provide an all-in-one role figther, but the cost would be a problem for many developing countries.<br><br>Given the J17 (with Nation X special mod) is selling at USD15mil per plane, another fully china made J17 is seeling at USD10mil. J10 is expected to be about USD20mil, JAS39 selling price is facing a lot of downward pressure from the PLAAF planes. In addition, JAS39 has some teething problem in fitting with the Russian &amp; Isreal weapons, as reported by an Eastern European Airforce.<br><br>I have a feeling that Thailand may want to try out the J17 (with Nation X mod) for her future airforce requirements. Thailand is facing some budget contraints in buying new F16 and JAS39. On the other hand, China has always been a steady arm supplier for Thai army and navy. It would make sense for China to sell the special graded J17 to Thailand, and open up the international market in South Asia and Africa. Thailand, on the other hand, can use the J17 as a bargain chip with BAE to negoitate for a better deal for the JAS39 as well.</div>

The reason is that the plane was ordered when we had Soviet as a neighbour, and today the need is much lower than the 204 ordered.<br><br>My idea is that we could sell you 45 used JAS39A as replacements for the F5 fighter, and your own defence industri takes care of adapting the plane to your environment (new software etc) This way you would get a new generation, multi-role combat aircraft  that is adapted for short takeoff and landings, low turnaround time, low flying and aquiring costs and adapted for conscript maintenance crews.<br><br>Hopefully we could take payment in Endurance class ships and Primus SP Howitzers   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"><br><br><a href="http://www.gripen.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.gripen.com</a></div>

Hmmm after all the JAS39 is a 4th generation combat aircraft in which only a handful of other fighters (Rafale, Eurofighter and F/A-22) belong to this category. But I believe the German PzH2000 would be a better choice for Sweden over the Primus SPH as it is more suited for European conditions. After all, your army already has the Leopard 2 MBT in service.<br><br>The Visby class corvettes from Sweden are also impressive... In fact I am hoping for an order from Singapore for 6 platforms to replace our aging German-designed missile corvettes around 2012.</div>

This makes it possible to replace the F5s in a 1-1 ratio, and by doing a barter deal,  no complicated countertrade deals has to be done.
