He suggests that there should be around 100 operation JAS (Jakt/Attack/Spaning - Fighter/Attack/Reconnaissance) fighter planes in the Swedish Air Force.<br><br>This leaves 65-70 planes too many. If these planes, which have cost taxpayers around 20 billion kronor, cannot be sold, the proposal suggests they should be discarded.<br><br>But according to General Lieutenant Mats Nilsson, a slimming of the fleet is necessary, despite the cost.<br><br>"We need to have a proper number to be able to operate the system in the long-term from the type of organization which parliament and the government have determined," Nilsson said.<br><br>The entire JAS fighter plane program has cost Swedish taxpayers around 100 billion kronor.<br><br>A total of 204 JAS series fighter planes have been produced, both for Swedish military use and for export.<br><br>Of these, only 28 planes have been exported so far. 14 have been sold to Hungary and 14 to the Czech Republic.</blockquote><a href="http://www.thelocal.se/article.php?ID=3654&amp;date=20060426" rel="nofollow">http://www.thelocal.se/article.php?ID=3654&amp;date=20060426</a></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Getting the extra Gripen is a really good buy if one actually knows the true capabilities of the Gripen especially in the area of data link and information sharing. It would make great F-5 replacement.<br><br>As attractive as it may seem, 70 planes still cost a heck lot of money and I doubt anyone could just buy them in 1 go... Even if Singapore barter trade say 100 pieces of Primus and a few Endurance, lets say 4, I doubt it still covers the price of secondhand Gripen, not to forget, these babies need to be upgraded too.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I don't think RSAF will be planning to get any aircraft to replace the F-5S,at least for the moment. Most probably, they wish to minimise the number of aircraft types to 2. They are still waiting for the purchase of the JSF but if the program delays further or plagued with problems like what happened with the Typhoon then perhaps they will get an interim fighter to replace the by then aging F-16C/Ds.<br><br>However, personally i feel that having Gripens to replace the F-5S is a good thing because its a good plane.

I saw this in a issue of Flight International a couple of months back.<br><br>The RSAF has apparently abandoned its plans to reduce the number of combat types from 3 to 2. Reasons were stated such as the need for a replacement for the F-5S/T fleet to be introduced in the 2010-2015 timeframe and that the F-35A is not expected to be available for export before 2014. The F-35A also has increased problems with costs and capability, notwithstanding the likelihood of the USA to release only a reduced capability export version. The RSAF has not yet expressed its full commitment to the F-35A. The Swedish JAS-39C/D Gripen and the South Korean A-50 are also emerging as competitors to replace the F-5S/T.<br><br>Further purchases of the F-15T beyond the current number of 20 may be influenced by attractive offers by Dassault and the Eurofighter Consortium in the next decade, if the RSAF decides to opt for a plane for air superiority and strike escort missions with a secondary ground attack capability. Furthermore, the RSAF needs to commit to additional F-15Ts by 2008 if the production line is to be extended beyond 2010.<br><br></div>

This shows that Singapore's confidence in the JSF program is decreasing and may not want to buy them in the future! If thats the case, i think  RSAF may choose to get more of the F-15SG for a competent long range strike force to truely replace the Super Skyhawks. Then will get the latest version of Rafale or Typhoon for true air superiority. It will be best if ^Delta^  can provide a scan of this article or some links if possible.

            <div class='col-md body'>Purchasing the F15SG makes sense, as it will make the option for RSAF with a a heavy firepower delivery with surgical precision aircraft. The bomb load for F15SG is 11.1 tons. In addition, people familiar with F15 should know that F15 is one of the handful plane that is capable to enage in high G turns with FULL weapon load.<br><br>The new radar on our F15SG is the most powerful in the SE Asia, only out-class by the F22 radar. This is critical in the post modern air combat arena. Being the last few customer, always get some SPECIAL discounts and EXTRAs, u know<img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br><br>No point wasting $$ on the MIG nor SUKKOI, spare parts supplies too unstable to maintain an effective continous air operation in the war times.<br><br>On the other hand, investing in the JAS 39 as a lead trainer plane do make sense. First of all, the JAS 39 is capable of providing good training to the future F15SG pilots. JAS 39 can provide training in Air-to-Air, Air-to-Ground and even Air-to-Sea training. In war time, JAS 39 is a potent war plane and provide a high standard in Attack, Recon, Air Superioirity roles that are unmatched by Hawk 200 and T-50.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Now why would we want to invest in the Gripen as a TRAINER? Kind of a waste for such an aircraft.<br><br>I hope the RSAF considers the Typhoon once it gets radar upgraded.  Nothing beats a high T/W ratio aircraft that can carry 10 AMRAAMs.</div>
