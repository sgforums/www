I rarely reply and when i do, it is with all seriousness.<br><br>You obviously have no experience with a/c much less ftrs.  Trust me when i say this with the best intentions:  there is no farkin' way any air force will arm the EF with 18 missiles anytime soon.  u want to mount 14 x AIM120s on the wings?  the engine can provide the trust for flight, but the wings aint gonna take the stress.  heck, u dun even need a pilot to tell you that; even an aeronautical enginner will tell you the same.<br><br>also, any wartime air campaign planning has to factor in losses/attrition. mounting 18 missiles is a waste.<br><br>Do your research.  Try and guess which ftr in service today can be armed the most AIM120s and how many... i've seen one before in flight; sure it looks impressive but it aint gonna be worth much in the 'merge.</div>
