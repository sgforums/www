How can we see from far and leave them in that kind of situation. We upheld peace..so quickly send</blockquote>That depends on various factors such as politics. The USA is certainly 1st world and they are the champions of 'world peace' (Pax Americania i must say) but you don't see them getting involved. Their participation in the previous stae of unrest is also minimal. So one may ask why is this so?<br><br>Firstly, Timor Leste is firmly in the sphere of influence of Australia, much like those tiny island countries in the Pacific such as Fiji.<br><br>Secondly, the US have nothing to gain from this as the oil and gas deposits are to be divided between Australia and Timor Leste. USA won't want to offend a trusty ally like Australia in their backyard.<br><br>Thirdly, they already have their hands and maybe even feet full in Afganistan and Iraq.<br><br>Singapore must access the situation carefully. This is because our military is mainly made up of conscripts. It will be hard to explain the deaths of sons to their parents when they died protecting people of another country, when we are all told that we are serving NS to protect Singapore.  However, i support the sending of ADF like the previous time. Since they are regulars, it will be more politically acceptable to send them to gain some combat experience <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"></div>

They left the Lumut naval base yesterday.<br><br>The troops have been taught the basic Tetum language, the spoken language by the locals, to introduce themselves as peacekeepers.<br><br>The fighting that began several weeks ago was sparked by the government's decision to sack almost half the country's military after the soldiers went on strike to protest against poor conditions.<br><br>The violence escalated on Thursday when at least nine people were killed and 27 wounded.<br><br>Referring to the admission of "mistakes" in the war in Iraq by US President George W. Bush and British Prime Minister Tony Blair on Thursday, Najib said Malaysia had been consistent in its stand that the sovereignty of all countries must be respected.<br><br>He said Malaysia did not support the invasion of Iraq which was not sanctioned by the United Nations.<br><br>The military action clearly had created chaos in Iraq and clouded the future of the country despite the recent formation of a new national government, he added.<br><br>On the failure of National Service Training Programme dodgers to respond to the final chance offered to them, Najib said the government should not be faulted for taking legal action against them.<br><br>-- BERNAMA</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Singapore is not in the business of flag waving exercises. If others would doubt our deployment capabilities, just have a look at our overseas deployments.<br><br>If any particular country can base thier prowess on a miniscule or small military contribution, then clearly, that country is starved for lack of pride and confidence in thier military. Clearly, a particular country, more known for bizzare statements and an equally bewildering or confusing(or confused)foriegn policy, if not minister,  is more powerful than Singapore, Thailand, Indonesia, Vietnam, etc since she has troops on the ground. Utter nonsense.<br><br>I agree with a previous poster who mentioned that East Timor serves no strategic value to Singapore. She`s too far away. She can offer us nothing in return for our help. That is prolly why we don`t even have an embassy there. As it happened, the East Timorese government appealed for help from nations which had formal diplomatic ties(embassies) with the infant government. In addition, they would not want countries too close to Indonesia within thier borders during such precarious times too.<br><br>I don`t think an independant East Timor is a viable entity. East Timor remains a future battle-ground between the Aussies and Indonesians. Another baggage to a whole list of problem shouldered by ASEAN. In fact, ASEAN does`nt really care. Smart nations who want to be in Indonesia`s group of close friends would stay away unless it does`nt affect relations or they have good strategic reasons to do so. Of course, some nations are`nt that smart anyway.</div>

The USA is certainly 1st world and they are the champions of 'world peace' (Pax Americania i must say) but you don't see them getting involved. Their participation in the previous stae of unrest is also minimal. So one may ask why is this so?<br><br>Firstly, Timor Leste is firmly in the sphere of influence of Australia, much like those tiny island countries in the Pacific such as Fiji.<br><br>Secondly, the US have nothing to gain from this as the oil and gas deposits are to be divided between Australia and Timor Leste. USA won't want to offend a trusty ally like Australia in their backyard.<br><br>Thirdly, they already have their hands and maybe even feet full in Afganistan and Iraq.<br><br>Singapore must access the situation carefully. This is because our military is mainly made up of conscripts. It will be hard to explain the deaths of sons to their parents when they died protecting people of another country, when we are all told that we are serving N S to protect Singapore.  However, i support the sending of ADF like the previous time. Since they are regulars, it will be more politically acceptable to send them to gain some combat experience <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"> </div></blockquote>send our regulars <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"></div>
