            <div class='col-md body'>Guys, let's be rational here.<br><br>The Timor rebellion is a suspected coup... and now news are saying that the people are now protesting against the current government for ineptness and corruption. The Government , in reality were placed in by the Australian, the rebel leader is Australian trained. The government says that they required "Foreign Troops" to maintain, and only "Foreign troops" can... which mean largely "Australians"<br><br>As soon as the Australian troops landed the fighting substantially die down. Now looting and gangs are roaming the streets. Isn't something not right here ?<br><br>As to the thought that Singapore would have a chance to get into the Oil/gas operation there is a Wet Dream.. it will go largely to Australia - Guarranteed. What Sg is operating there are small business, petrol stations, trading co and supermarkets... hardly worth the efforts.<br><br>While it's good to support against the violence there, one must know what politics are conspiring there.. the Australian forces are too strung up in their so-called "War on terror" escapade with the US... which is Imperialism. And I wonder if the current Timorese government and the Rebels are in  it for the Australian... perhaps because the Chinese is starting the get prominent there... and may well dilute the Austarlian influence... just like what the Taiwan has done in Solomon Island, and has successfully removed China's economic influence there. Did you know that the Taiwanese and their businesses were protected by the Government, and only China's businesses were up in flames ??<br><br></div>
