            <div class='col-md body'>East Timor<br>Singapore open to sending troops<br>Australian minister quotes Hsien Loong as saying request has to come from the beleaguered country. The Australian.<br>Jun 8, 2006<br><br>SINGAPOREAN Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong will consider sending troops to help stabilise East Timor as soon as he gets a formal request from the East Timorese Government.<br><br>Defence Minister Brendan Nelson raised the possibility of Singaporean troops going to East Timor in private talks with Mr Lee in Singapore at the weekend.<br><br>Singaporean troops would be highly sought after because of their high level of equipment, training, discipline and expertise.<br><br>However, sending ethnic Chinese troops into a territory adjacent to Indonesia would be acutely sensitive with Jakarta. It is believed the Singaporean and Indonesian governments have been discussing this issue.<br><br>Mr Lee gave strong backing to Australia's role in East Timor, where it is leading the multinational mission to restore peace.<br><br>"I think you have to do it," he told The Australian. "It's in your backyard."<br><br>However, he said Singapore would need a formal invitation from the East Timorese Government before sending troops. "They are the authority, they have the sovereign power."<br><br>Singapore sent troops to East Timor as part of the Interfet mission after the vote for independence in 1999.<br><br>"This time, we have not been asked (by the East Timorese Government) so the issue is hypothetical," Mr Lee said. "If the situation comes up, we will consider the matter."<br><br>It is believed Singaporean troops are at the top of the list of possible Southeast Asian contributions to the force in East Timor.<br><br>Mr Lee said that while foreign troops had a key role to play in restoring calm to the new country, the problem must ultimately be solved by the East Timorese.<br><br>"This is not a problem that can be solved by outside forces. It is a problem within East Timor, among East Timorese. They have to sort it out among themselves."<br><br>Mr Lee will visit Sydney and Canberra over several days from next Tuesday. It is his first visit to Australia as Prime Minister.<br><br>Mr Lee signalled one area of disagreement with Canberra, saying he was disappointed at the decision to exclude Singapore Airlines from routes to the US from Australia.<br><br>He said this decision was economically and strategically harmful to Australia and a sign that Qantas, which lobbied against the changes, had too much influence.<br><br>However, on other strategic questions, Mr Lee's views are consistent with those of John Howard, including the importance of the US not quitting Iraq before the job is done.<br><br>"If they quit in Iraq the price will be very high," he said.<br><br>"This is different from leaving Vietnam, where the Vietnamese just stay in Vietnam. If you leave Iraq, your enemies will follow you all over the world."<br>The Australian<br><br><a href="http://www.littlespeck.com/content/security/CTrendsSecurity-060608.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.littlespeck.com/content/security/CTrendsSecurity-060608.htm</a><br><br></div>
