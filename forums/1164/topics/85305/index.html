            <div class='col-md body'>Just wondering, if Singapore's power get knocked out by some foreign force trying to do some real damage, how dead are we?<br><br>TVs will not be working, so how do you do an open mobilisation? unless TV mobile? but TV mobile also limited reach and only the ones on the buses will work<br><br>Battery-operated radios? not everyone will have.. prob the handphone radio?<br><br>both cases are assuming the broadcast stations still have their power or got some backup power<br><br>can the NSmen be contacted by handphone if the local GSM networks are jammed by people trying to call relatives, call police, call SCDF?<br><br>supposedly the landlines were still available, but thats assuming the NSmen for call up are at the workplace or at home...<br><br>just venturing some ideas... i've never been to NS myself (not until abt 2-3 more years anyway, so i wont know any "real" stuff.. )<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Actually, I don't think there's anything to be greatly alarmed about. In a nationwide blackout, the SAF can always do a silent mob - &amp; if you've done recall i/c before, you'll know there's alternate measures to rounding up your people if the phones are down. (Supposedly classified info, but it's an open secret among male citizens.)<br><br>If it's a terror attack by a shadowy cell, the standby units will be deployed ad-hoc - that's what they're structured for within the system.<br><br>If it's a terror act by fifth-columnists preceding an invasion force, I dare say a lot of NSmen will already be called back to camp by then.<br><br>The thing is, you don't mobilize such troops on a whim; the respective divisional staffs would've put forth an approved plan - however preliminary - before the activation order goes out. &amp; as long as the foe represents a conventional force - let's say on the orders of an ultra-nationalist or fundamentalist neighbor government - the Singapore government (&amp; local populace) would've taken note of their foreign-policy aggressiveness on the outset.<br><br>I remember when I was doing NS in '86-88, there was overt Malaysian hostility over a series of events - the Israeli PM visit, then GCK's comments about Malays in the army, then a supposed SAF assault-boat intrusion into their waters - which the SAF took seriously, certainly more than the subsequent complaints in the '90's about our planes flying into their territory. We raised our alert status to a high level  &amp; was prepared for any eventualities; I experienced the tension, even if it was essentially for deterrent's sake, cuz my unit was RECON 1.<br><br>I expect the SAF will do a thorough review on whether operational readiness would be severely hurt by another such blackout; one area I had in mind - &amp; I stand corrected if I'm wrong on this - is civil-resource requisition, which I believe is only done by open mob(?) under the existing system. They may need to introduce logistical contingencies in terms of recalling all the relevant vehicles.</div>
