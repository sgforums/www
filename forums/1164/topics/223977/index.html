Heinz, deputy program executive officer of the F-35 Lightning II Program.<br><br>The initial schedule, as stated on the F-16.net forum, was as follows:<br>Dec 05 - Low Speed Taxi Tests (30 knots)<br>Dec 07 - Medium Speed Taxi Tests<br>Dec 09 - High Speed Taxi Tests<br>Dec 11 - First Flight of the CTOL variant (60-minutes)<br>Dec 13 - Second Flight<br><br>Bad weather however delayed things a bit though and the low speed taxi tests won't be held before Dec 07.<br><br>The aircraft's development has been co-financed by eight international partners -- Britain, Italy, Netherlands, Turkey, Canada, Australia, Denmark and Norway.<br><br>Heinz predicted all eight partners would buy F-35s by 2014, bringing their combined purchases to more than 3,100 aircraft, including the more than 2,400 planned for the United States and 138 scheduled for Britain.<br><br>As early as 2010, the Pentagon expects to define an F-35 configuration for sale to even more countries through the U.S. Foreign Military Sales program, Heinz said at the Reuters Aerospace and Defense Summit in Washington.<br><br>Spain, which would be looking at the F-35B short take-off vertical-landing (STOVL) variant to replace the Boeing AV-8B Harrier II Plus aircraft that it is currently operating is certain to be one country would certainly be one of the other first buyers, next to possibly Israel and Singapore.<br><br>"I believe there will be an additional 2,000 aircraft" sold from 2015 through 2035 to countries outside the original production consortium, Heinz said.<br><br>On November 14, the Netherlands became the first of the F-35 partner nations to extend its participation from development into a production and support phase.<br><br>Canada and Australia will follow suit on Monday and Tuesday, respectively, Heinz said, with the others expected to do so by the end of this month, with the possible exception of Norway because of questions in its legislature about its industry's share of F-35-related contracts.<br><br></div>

The test initiated the last round of evaluations before the jet's first flight, and marked the first time the aircraft moved under its own power.<br><br>After a series of systems checks at Lockheed Martin [NYSE: LMT] in Fort Worth, F-35 Chief Pilot Jon Beesley advanced the throttle and the F-35 moved out of its hangar to begin taxi tests. The jet then traveled at up to 30 knots (~ 35 m.p.h.) on the runway, testing systems such as brakes and nosewheel steering in advance of first flight. Medium-speed taxi tests of 65 knots (~ 75 m.p.h.) and 80 knots (~ 92 m.p.h.) are planned next, weather permitting.

            <div class='col-md body'>I have a burning question to ask.<br><br>Since we all know that the internal weapons bay for the F-35 is limited and chances are we need to hang the weapons externally on the air frame for those heavy strike missions. Having external weapons will certainly compromise its stealth characteristics.<br><br>Therefore will a fully loaded(internally and externally) F-35 still be stealthier as compared to a say fully loaded F-16C/D or F-15SG?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"></div>

Even if the stores (eg AAM or bombs etc) are jettisioned, the plane is not stealthy as the pylons (unless the pylons could be jettisioned too!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_twisted.gif" alt="Twisted Evil" title="Twisted Evil"> ) will compromise the radar cross section of the plane.  If not, <strong><span style="color: red;">a fully loaded (externally) F-35 is no stealthier than a fully loaded F-16 or F-15</span></strong>.<br><br>Similar with the Raptor, a LO F-35 is only possible if it doesn;t carry any external equipment.  We may have seen pictures of Raptor carrying external fuel tanks and AAM, but the USAF know, in order for a external equipped Raptor (or even a F-35) to survive in hostile airspace, that will only be possible if all hostile defences are taken out.  Therefore, for the 1st strike, you need a clean Raptor/F35 to clear the path thereby clearing the way for non-stealthy planes like F-15/16-type to survive.</div>

"What a great start for the flight-test program, and a testimony to the people who have worked so hard to make this happen." The most powerful engine ever placed in a fighter aircraft Â– the Pratt &amp; Whitney F135 turbofan, with 40,000 pounds of thrust Â– effortlessly pushed the F-35 skyward.<br><br>The flight of the conventional takeoff and landing (CTOL) F-35 variant began at 12:44 p.m. CST at Lockheed Martin in Fort Worth, Texas, when the jet lifted off and began a climb-out to 15,000 feet. Beesley then performed a series of maneuvers to test aircraft handling and the operation of the engine and subsystems. He returned for a landing at 1:19 p.m CST. Two F16s and an F/A-18 served as chase aircraft.<br><br>The stealthy F-35 is a supersonic, multi-role, 5TH Generation fighter designed to replace a wide range of existing aircraft, including AV-8B Harriers, A-10s, F-16s, F/A-18 Hornets and United Kingdom Harrier GR.7s and Sea Harriers.<br><br>"The first flight of the F-35 Lightning II is an historic moment because, for the first time ever, we are seeing the dawn of an aircraft with all the 5TH Generation attributes Â– including advanced stealth, fighter agility, sensor fusion and greatly improved supportability Â– combined in an affordable package," said Ralph Heath, president of Lockheed Martin Aeronautics Co. "The F-35 will be the most advanced and most capable multi-role fighter on the international market for many, many years to come."<br><br>Dan Crowley, Lockheed Martin executive vice president and general manager of the F-35 program, said the aircraft has continued to meet or exceed expectations during its assembly and pre-flight checkouts. It has now embarked on a 12,000-hour flight-test program designed to validate tens of thousands of hours of testing already completed in F-35 laboratories. "The F-35 will enter service as the most exhaustively tested, most thoroughly proven fighter system in history," Crowley said. "And thanks to its all-digital design, an exceptionally talented international engineering team and the worldÂ’s best assemblers and mechanics, the F-35 has completely rewritten the book on fighter assembly precision and quality."<br><br>The United States and eight international partners are involved in the F-35's funding and development. The U.S. Air Force, Navy and Marine Corps, and the United KingdomÂ’s Royal Air Force and Royal Navy plan to acquire a total of 2,581 F-35s. Italy, the Netherlands, Turkey, Canada, Australia, Denmark and Norway also are partners in the program and are expected to add about 700 more aircraft to the total. F-35 sales to other international customers could push the final number of aircraft to 4,500 or beyond.<br><br>"We believe the F-35 is poised to become the world standard-bearer of fighter aircraft," said Tom Burbage, Lockheed Martin executive vice president and general manager of F-35 program integration.<br><br>Three versions of the F-35 are under development: a conventional takeoff and landing (CTOL) variant for conventional runways, a short takeoff/vertical landing (STOVL) variant for operating off small ships and near front-line combat zones, and a carrier variant (CV) for catapult launches and arrested recoveries on board the U.S. NavyÂ’s large aircraft carriers.<br><br>Lockheed Martin is developing the F-35 Lightning II with its principal industrial partners, Northrop Grumman and BAE Systems. Two separate, interchangeable F-35 engines are under development: the Pratt &amp; Whitney F135 and the GE Rolls-Royce Fighter Engine Team F136.<br><br><a href="http://www.f-16.net/news_article2097.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.f-16.net/news_article2097.html</a></div>

We may have seen pictures of Raptor carrying external fuel tanks and AAM, but the USAF know, in order for a external equipped Raptor (or even a F-35) to survive in hostile airspace, that will only be possible if all hostile defences are taken out.  Therefore, for the 1st strike, you need a clean Raptor/F35 to clear the path thereby clearing the way for non-stealthy planes like F-15/16-type to survive.         [/b]</blockquote>I understand and agree with you. But doesn't the radar absorbing and/or reflective paint and the angles on the air frame some what increase at least by a little the stealthiness of a fully loaded F-35 as compared to the fully loaded F-16C/D and F-15SG?</div>

Â“The aircraft handled well, better than the simulator,Â” says F-35 chief pilot Jon Beesley, at the controls for the 35min maiden flight from Fort Worth, Texas.<br><br><img src="http://www.flightglobal.com/assets/getAsset.aspx?ItemID=15928"><br><br>Beesley was surprised by the aircraftÂ’s performance on take-off, saying: Â“The climb-out was steeper than I anticipated.Â”  He praises the responsiveness and controllability of the aircraft and its engine, the 40,000lb thrust-class Pratt &amp; Whitney F135: Â“I could fly to a test point and put the aircraft where I wanted to.Â”<br><br><img src="http://www.flightglobal.com/assets/getAsset.aspx?ItemID=15932"><br><br>First F-35 take-off<br><br>The aircraft was flown to 15,000ft (4,600m) and 225kt (415km/h) with the landing gear down, then slowed to approach speed. Â“The first three sets of test points were to make sure we could land,Â” Beesley says.<br><br><img src="http://www.flightglobal.com/assets/getAsset.aspx?ItemID=15930"><br><br>The test plan then called for the gear to be retracted, but there was a small sensor anomaly and mission rules required the aircraft to come back, he says, describing the problem as a calibration issue with one of the air-data probes. Â“There was an angle-of-attack miscomparison. It was a little off,Â” he says.<br><br>Redundancy in the air-data system ensured the aircraft flew safely, says Dan Crowley, F-35 programme general manager. The sensor design has already been changed for future JSFs, he says: Â“We will go away from this type of probe to a new type.Â”<br><br>The original plan to cycle the gear during a 60min first flight was Â“aggressiveÂ”, according to Beesley. Â“We didnÂ’t want to be bored, so we planned to raise the gear. That would have exceeded other programmes.Â”<br><br>Â“We completed the majority of flight-test points,Â” says Crowley. Â“The few related to raising the gear were not accomplished, but we are really pleased with the quality of flight test data we got.Â”<br><br><img src="http://www.flightglobal.com/assets/getAsset.aspx?ItemID=15933"><br><br>Lockheed plans to fly the first JSF, aircraft AA-1, five to six times a month over the next 18 months as it completes construction the 14 Â“optimised airframeÂ” F-35s that will be used for the bulk of the 6,000-plus test flights. The first of these Â– BF-1, the first short take-off and vertical landing F-35B Â– is scheduled to fly in 2008.<br><br>Although structurally different, AA-1 is representative of the production aircraft, says Crowley: Â“Fit, finish and quality is the same as you will see in production. We have proved you can make a distributed international team work collaboratively.Â”<br><br>Â“I have never been involved with a first aircraft that was so solid, yet so sophisticated,Â” says Beesley. Â“We flew around 90% of what will be in the other aircraft.Â” This includes the navigation system and Â“finger-on-glassÂ” touchscreen cockpit displays.<br><br>The F-35Â’s electrically signaled and actuated flight controls worked flawlessy, Beesley says, adding: Â“This is the first electric jet.Â” Handling qualities are similar to, but better than, those of LockheedÂ’s F-22, he says, adding: Â“It flies like a smaller and quicker Raptor.Â”<br><br>Tom Burbage, general manager, F-35 programme integration, says that, as soon as the F-35 lifted off from the Fort Worth runway, his cellphone began ringing with calls from the international JSF partners. Â“This was a flight that was heard around the world,Â” he says.</div>
