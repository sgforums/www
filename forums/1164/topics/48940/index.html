            <div class='col-md body'>Total suspends exploration work amid Brunei-Malaysia spat<br><br>KUALA LUMPUR - French oil company Total said on Monday it had suspended exploration work in an oil block off Borneo due to a territorial dispute between Malaysia and Brunei.<br><br>Total, leader of a consortium which last year won a Brunei tender for one of two huge offshore blocks, said it was ''surprised'' that Malaysia had entered territorial claims on the area.<br><br>Work had been halted to await the outcome of discussions between the two governments, said chairman and chief executive Thierry Desmarest.<br><br>''Exploration was suspended a few weeks ago,'' he told reporters on the sidelines of an Asia oil and gas conference here.<br><br>''We are surprised to see it is contested by another country. Under international practices, the waters are legitimate to Brunei. I hope at the end of the day there will be an amicable solution.''<br><br>Brunei last year awarded one block to Total and its partners US Amerada Hess and Australian BHP Billiton, and the other to Anglo-Dutch giant Royal Dutch/Shell group, involving Mitsubishi and ConocoPhillips, the New York-based International Oil Daily reported on Monday.<br><br>Since early this year, however, the deepwater blocks have also been claimed by Malaysia whose state-owned oil firm Petronas awarded identical acreage to US Murphy Oil and its own subsidiary, Petronas Carigali, the publication of the Energy Intelligence Group said.<br><br>A drilling team from Total was chased off the block by the Malaysian navy in March, according to the Oil Daily, quoting reports from a Brunei newspaper.<br><br><strong>The contested area represents about half of Brunei's entire offshore territory and is vital to its plans to diversify its oil-dependent economy</strong>.<br><br>Give feedback on this article<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Despite Bruneis apparent military inferiority I doubt the present Malaysian government will dare to attempt any military takeover of any part of Bruneis territory. The same can be said about Singapore, Indonesia or anyone in ASEAN thinking about attempting military adventures into other countries. Its just not worth it to do such things in the present context<br><br>As it is, even though ownership is disputed, it is still internationally recognised sovereign Bruneian land, any attempt to change the staus quo will undoubtedly raise international heckles, more so bearing in mind Brunei's resources.<br><br>Atobe, Malaysia won Indonesia to Sipadan and Ligitan because the ICJ ruled in favour of "Status Quo". If by applying the same standards, an ICJ ruling will likely favour Brunei since it has always been administered by Brunei.<br><br>Unless theres something I don't know about yet...As Atobe has said, we still don't know a lot of the facts  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_confused.gif" alt="Confused" title="Confused"><br></div>
