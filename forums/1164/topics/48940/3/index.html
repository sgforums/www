Look around u in this SG forum; u knew such think would happen in this thread. U knew there are Malaysians reading this thread. And by all mean and purposes u actually intends to provoke us in this forum. What actually u intend to see? Satisfaction to see people on both site of the causeway in fire? Or better still, u want to instill a higher level of patriotisms in Singaporeans by provoking every internal disputes issue with your neighboring countries in these regions. Worst, would you love to see Malaysia &amp; Indonesia destabilized?<br><br>Keep in mind the dispute is between Malaysia and Brunei. If we managed to solve this issue amicably whether is 50/50 or otherwise then that is good sign to the region is stable and prospers. Unless tripwire, again your intention is to tarnish Malaysian image to the world.<br><br>As for Malaysian and Singapore dispute, like it or not and face the truth, started the moment Singapore ceded out from the federation. U thinks Russia likes to see Chencha or the Indonesia wants to see Aceh ceded? Consider we are all lucky such thing is yet to happen and should not happened.<br><br>If u thinks that Malaysia will disintegrate, it is all in your wild &amp; wet imagination. I am sure the Malaysia federal government will takes and use [b]all measures deems necessary </strong>to preserve all the states in Malaysia either from <strong>foreign or domestic </strong>doing and <strong>whether the world like it or not</strong>.<br><br>Top of the dispute list is the price of water. Proved to us or tell the whole world how much did Singapore pays for the water from Malaysia. Remember it is the Malaysian resources. U thinks we want to keep selling the water for a near FOC value. If you ask for a referendum, the whole of Malaysia would love not to renew supplying water to Singapore.<br><br>With the current and anticipated severe future dry spell, our people needs is important I suppose if the Malaysia government inform a polite notice to Singapore government that a severe disruption of water will be in affect (Hint: Not a drop of water to Sg for 3 months) would u tripwire order a pre emptive strike because of it?<br><br>[/b]</blockquote>you malaysian like to talk kok sing alot of song....<br><br>as far as singapore sees it... the RMN presence in brunei water is a test of singapore's resolve in coming to brunei's aid...<br><br>while it remains to be seen whether singapore and brunei have a hidden joint defence pact..<br><br>it is undeniable that brunei currency is linked with singapore currency, such a link resulted in that any impact on the economy of either nation would have a ripple effect on the other...<br><br>understandably... malaysia's expansionist nationalistic govt has been eyeing the sultanate of brunei since the 60s and have not given up on their hope to annex brunei...<br><br>the move by RMN into brunei water is a clear provocation and went against the charters in the ASEAN grouping on consultation and mutual respect...<br><br>RMN's actions against brunei is abhoring and pure bullying of a nation that has neither an air force nor a navy capable of defending its interest...<br><br>seriously, in view of the close ties of brunei and singapore... if singapore allows brunei to be bullied by malaysia or even occupied by malaysia... what is there to prevent malaysia from aiming at singapore next with the fund they would gain from brunei's oil reserve and the impact on singapore currency in the absence of joint link with a legitimate brunei dollar??<br><br>thus... i do not feel that it is merely a matter between malaysia and brunei... in fact, i think the whole ASEAN nations should come in and help to resolve the matter to avoid brunei from being victimised by a larger ASEAN nation...<br><br>else... SAF must show its teeth by perhaps deploying our subs, 2 squadron of falcons and at least reinforced bridgade to brunei and show we mean to safe guard singapore's interest and brunei's interest against malaysian belligerence... if malaysia should continue to threaten the security of brunei... otherwise... guess who is next after brunei on the malaysian menu... we in SAF not stupid leh....<br><br>lastly... with respect to water supply...<br><br>with respect to the price of the water and terms of supply... go and ask the man you called the father of malaysia... if you think he is stupid to sign the water agreedment with singapore... you can go and dig up his grave if you want to...<br><br>with respect to you attempting to break the water supply treaty... i just wanna say... we KNEW from day one... malaysia is not a gentleman nation.. they would not have kept their words nor honor their terms in a bilateral agreedment... that is why our govt filed the agreedment with the UN...<br><br>malaysia can complain all it want to the world, to all its malaysian citizens.. but the water agreedment is filed with UN for the whole world to see for themselves... who is the big lier...<br><br>come on... we all knew what kind of a coconut govt runs malaysia from day to day... honestly, integrity and honor are the last thing in their head... that is why we have the SAF... to ensure that they knew the consequence of breaking  a treaty...<br><br>so... if you wanna cut water supply to singapore... you are welcomed to try...  otherwise... you can SHUT UP and enjoy your drought... hahahahahahaa.a....<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br></div>

What i'm trying to say...everybody will protect their leader, their people and their country in every aspect. Of course Singaporean too. If you need somebody to respect you then you have to do the same thing. But if your people or your country worried bout your interest in other country like Brunei then no need to blame Malaysia. Like i said earlier... Singapore &amp; Malaysia claim Batu Putih. It's between 2 countries. When we (Malaysia) claim our territory, it's between Malaysia and Brunei. So mind your own business. Dont tell me bout your sympathy to Brunei. We always use diplomacy. Not like your brother "US". Invade Iraq for oil. Try to change Venezuela leader just of oil. I can see here.. your sympathy to brunei because of their oil. Not more than that. If Brunei running out of petrol/oil..  you never take care about brunei. "Ada udang sebalik batu".</div>
