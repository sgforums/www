            <div class='col-md body'>Tripwire,<br><br>To be expected the way you reply to this issue. Look around u in this SG forum; u knew such think would happen in this thread. U knew there are Malaysians reading this thread. And by all mean and purposes u actually intends to provoke us in this forum. What actually u intend to see? Satisfaction to see people on both site of the causeway in fire? Or better still, u want to instill a higher level of patriotisms in Singaporeans by provoking every internal disputes issue with your neighboring countries in these regions. Worst, would you love to see Malaysia &amp; Indonesia destabilized?<br><br>Keep in mind the dispute is between Malaysia and Brunei. If we managed to solve this issue amicably whether is 50/50 or otherwise then that is good sign to the region is stable and prospers. Unless tripwire, again your intention is to tarnish Malaysian image to the world.<br><br>As for Malaysian and Singapore dispute, like it or not and face the truth, started the moment Singapore ceded out from the federation. U thinks Russia likes to see Chencha or the Indonesia wants to see Aceh ceded? Consider we are all lucky such thing is yet to happen and should not happened.<br><br>If u thinks that Malaysia will disintegrate, it is all in your wild &amp; wet imagination. I am sure the Malaysia federal government will takes and use <strong>all measures deems necessary </strong>to preserve all the states in Malaysia either from <strong>foreign or domestic </strong>doing and <strong>whether the world like it or not</strong>.<br><br>Top of the dispute list is the price of water. Proved to us or tell the whole world how much did Singapore pays for the water from Malaysia. Remember it is the Malaysian resources. U thinks we want to keep selling the water for a near FOC value. If you ask for a referendum, the whole of Malaysia would love not to renew supplying water to Singapore.<br><br>With the current and anticipated severe future dry spell, our people needs is important I suppose if the Malaysia government inform a polite notice to Singapore government that a severe disruption of water will be in affect (Hint: Not a drop of water to Sg for 3 months) would u tripwire order a pre emptive strike because of it?<br><br></div>

I dont understand why bcoz we (Malaysian) dont like to busybody. When somebody use bad word to our leader of coz we (Malaysian) angry with that. Our leader vote by our people. Like this thread why use "RMN invading Brunei" ???.. why RMN ??... why use word invading ??.. it's Malaysia territory, it's our job to protect our territory but with diplomacy.. how many times we use force ??... none. Although we got army, navy and airforce but it's not our style. Why dont use title "Whose territory - Malaysia or Brunei ??" for this thread ??.  Any hidden agenda ?...<br>Who care if some of u got friend even godfather in KL, i also got a friend in Singapore and her husband one of the Vip in Singapore minister. She live in central of Singapore.. i cant tell u much it's our personal. That's why i said i dont like to have a war or busybody bcoz it will hurt me too if somethings happen to Singaporean. And i want Singaporean respect Malaysian and our policy too.<br>Believe me.. most of Malaysian dont like war especially with Singapore. So especially for you Nanthan, alphanumeric and tripwire.. pls stop flamming and show some respect.</div>
