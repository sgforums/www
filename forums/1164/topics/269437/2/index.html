            <div class='col-md body'>The Siamese Kingdom officially annexed parts of a Malay sultanate called Pattani a hundred years ago and then the British confirmed that annexation during their colonial rule of Malaya. Something like that in a nutshell...<br><br>So these "Thai" Muslims are actually Malays - in race, language, religion, customs etc. Basically, they are not of the Siamese race.<br><br><a href="http://www.abc.net.au/foreign/content/2005/s1434675.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.abc.net.au/foreign/content/2005/s1434675.htm</a><br><br>The Tak Bai massacre:<br>"In October last year, the Thai Army put down a Muslim-led demonstration by arresting hundreds, and then stacking them six-deep like logs onto trucks. During a six-hour journey, 85 Muslims died of asphyxiation.<br><br><span style="color: red;">The roots of the conflict go back a century or more, to when Buddhist Thailand annexed this predominantly Muslim region populated by ethnic Malays."</span><br><br>Malaysia and Indonesia strongly protested against this massacre.<br><br>Of course, both sides have committed so many attrocities which side you choose in the end depend on whether you are Muslim or not.<br><br>Officially, KL does not support the insurgency. But for the average Malaysian Malay Muslim, where they stand is not hard to guess.<br><br>Further reading:<br><a href="http://www.newsday.com/news/nationworld/world/ny-wothai244244525may04,0,2764127.story?coll=ny-worldnews-toputility" rel="nofollow">http://www.newsday.com/news/nationworld/world/ny-wothai244244525may04,0,2764127.story?coll=ny-worldnews-toputility</a><br><br>I apologise for taking this whole thing so far out of context. But for some of us who feel that MAF buys tanks or fighters to counter SAF, I tend to think we are giving ourselves too much credit. Thailand and Indonesia, on the other hand, are 2 of the oldest established Kingdoms in this region and they continue to have territorial aspirations.<br><br>The Malaysians know SG will not attack them without provocation nor do we really have the crazy idea of colonising their territory.<br><br>On the other hand, they have historically viewed Thailand as a powerful, often hostile Kingdom. And that Kingdom did invade and still occupy the Malay Sultanate of Pattani. And the Thais continue prove their reputation as a ruthless people.<br><br>If you look at the whole map  of SE Asia, they are surrounded by Thailand and Indonesia and their few dozens PT-91 is not enough for squat.<br><br>...<br><br>Basically, if the occupation of Pattani did not occur, it would likely be a part of Malaysia today. Malaysia is not making any noise today because I think the Brits - in recognition of Thailand's annexation of Pattani, gave them Sabah and Sarawak in return (or something like that) so the Malaysians are keeping mum about Pattani. Else the whole thing unravels.<br><br>So while we annoy the Malaysians with our huge arsenal, they can see we are just being paranoid androids (with good cause, i add). But the Thais on the other hand, had been real bad boys. I'm sure no one here needs to be reminded that they let the Japs into Malaya during WW2.<br><br>The INDOs gave them Konfrontasi. And recently wanted to claim some land.<br><br>All we ever gave the Malaysians were petty little spats. So why would they view us as their biggest threat?</div>
