            <div class='col-md body'><span class="large"><strong>Malay people</strong></span><br><br>From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia.<br>http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malay_people<br><br>Malays (Dutch, Malayo, ultimately from Malay: Melayu) are a diverse group of people living in the Malay archipelago and Malay peninsula in South East Asia.<br><br>They constitute the dominant race which live in Malaysia, Indonesia, Brunei, the Philippines and East Timor, which together with Singapore make up what is called the Malay archipelago.<br><br><span style="color: red;"><strong>The Malays are traditionally classified as a member of the Mongoloid race, along with other Asiatic peoples, including Chinese, Mongols, Japanese, Koreans, Thais, Vietnamese and Burmese.<br><br>Malays are also linguistically related to the Polynesian and Micronesian groups of the mid-Pacific, as members of the wide ranging Austronesian family of languages. Evidence also suggests that Polynesians and Micronesians may be descended, at least in part, from seafaring ancestors that originated in and around the Malay racial stock stronghold. </strong></span>Malay peoples have black hair and are typically of darker skin complexions, usually dark brown.<br><br><strong>Origin of the word Malay</strong><br><br>The word "Malay" was adopted into English via the Dutch word "Malayo", which ultimately originates from the Malay word "Melayu".<br><br>According to one popular theory, the native name Melayu means Â“migratingÂ” or Â“fleeingÂ”, which might refer to the high mobility of these people across the region.<br><br>The term is used as a form of ethnic self-identification. It is both generic and specific.<br><br><strong>Ethnic Group vs. Cultural Sphere</strong><br><br>The term Malay can refer to the ethnic group who live in the Malay peninsula and east Sumatra as well as the cultural sphere that encompass a large part of the archipelago. The Malay ethnic group is the majority in Malaysia and Brunei and a sizeable minority in Singapore and Indonesia. This people speak various dialects of Malay language. The peninsular dialect is the standard speech among Malays in Malaysia and Singapore. Meanwhile, the Riau dialect of eastern Sumatra is adopted as a national tongue, Bahasa Indonesia, for the whole Indonesian population. The ethnic Malay are overwhelmingly Muslim.<br><br>The Malay cultural sphere has something to do with the historic pre-eminence of the ethnic Malay in the sea trading route. Malay cultural influences filtered out throughout the archipelago, such as the monarchical state, religion (Hinduism/Buddhism in the first millennium AD, Islam in the second millennium), and the Malay language. Malay is the regional lingua franca, and Malay-based pidgins exist in most trading ports in Indonesia (see Malay-based creoles). On the other hand, the Malay presence in the Philippines might be mainly due to migrations in the late first millennium AD.<br><br>In this broad sense, the term Malay also includes most ethnic groups in the Philippines and Indonesia west of Papua. It is best understood as a cultural, not racial grouping. For example, people of the Maluku and Nusa Tenggara islands up to Timor have darker skin but are more readily described as Malays than the Dayaks of inner Borneo.<br><br><strong>Malay Domain</strong><br><br>Generally, the name "Malay" is used to describe all the numerous related groups including the Acehnese, Minangs, Bataks and Mandailings who live in Sumatra ; Javanese and Sundanese in Java ; Banjars, Ibans, Kadazans and Melanaus in Borneo ; Bugis and Torajans in Sulawesi ; the various dominant ethnic groups in the Philippines such as the Tagalogs, Ilocanos and Ifugao of Luzon island, the Visayans of the central Philippines, the Maguindanao, Tausug and Bajau of Mindanao and the Sulu Archipaelago ; and the people of East Timor (excluding those of older Papuan stock).<br><br>Specifically, this name is also the proper name of the subgroup which is native to the eastern part of Sumatra but migrated to the Malay Peninsula and the Riau Archipelago over the past thousand years or so. Sometimes, but very rarely, this subgroup is called "Riau Malays" to distinguish it as a specific group.<br><br>Other groups classified as Malays which live outside what is called the Malay archipelago include the Cham who live in Cambodia and Vietnam and the Utsuls who live on the island of Hainan. Descendants of the Malays could be found today in Sri Lanka, South Africa (the "Cape Malays") and Madagascar. In the latter, they are known as the Merina and one of the dominant ethnic groups in that country.<br><br>Surinam, on the north-eastern coast of South America, has a large population of ethnic Javanese descendants of fairly recent immigrant workers.<br><br><strong>Languages</strong><br><br>The languages spoken by Malays are classified as members of the Malayo-Polynesian family of languages, which is now known as Austronesian. This large family of languages includes all the native languages spoken by Malays across the Malay Archipielago, including Bahasa Indonesia, Bahasa Malaysia, all of the native languages of the Philippines, Tetum (East Timorese), and the language of the Merina Malay of Madagascar. Also included as far-flung members of this large family of languages on the Polynesian branch are the languages spoken by Polynesians, such as Samoan, Hawaiian and Maori in New Zealand.<br><br><strong>Religion</strong><br><br>In terms of religion, most Malays had converted from Hinduism, Buddhism and animism to Muslims in the early 15th century; influenced surprisingly, by Chinese seafarers from China who already had more than 700 years of interaction with Muslims from Middle East during the Islamic Golden Age. Today, Muslims Malay form the dominant religious group in Indonesia, Malaysia and Brunei. Their conversion to Islam from Hinduism and Theravada Buddhism began in the 1400s, with a large influenced by the decision of the royal court of Malacca. Most Malays in Singapore, Thailand, South Africa, Sri Lanka and Surinam are also Muslims.<br><br>Golden images of Garuda, the phoenix who is the mount of Vishnu have been found in the Philippine island of Palawan. A 4 lb., 1 foot-high, gold Hindu-Malayan idol of a goddess, now resting in the Field Museum, was discovered in the Philippine island of Mindanao, in 1917. However Islam forbids images and idols, which indicates clearly that this idol existed in Mindano before the arrival of Islam. Many Malays in Mindanao were also Muslim, but are recounted to have been the 23rd and last group in the waves of migration, to have arrived in the Philippines from the south. As a result of Spanish colonization spaning just over three centuries most contemporary Filipinos are Christians, primarily Roman Catholics. A majority of Filipinos in the southern island of Mindanao and the Sulu chain - that had resisted Spanish colonial encroachment, and still continue struggle against modern Filipino government assimilation policies - are to this day mostly Muslim.<br><br>Like most Malays of the Philippines, those of East Timor are also Christian, though this time as a result of Portuguese colonial rule. These two latter countries together represent the only Christian-majority nations in Asia (excluding the nations of Georgia and Armenia, both demographic extensions of Europe in Southwest Asia).<br><br>Hinduism is the dominant religion in the island of Bali. Smaller groups scattered throughout the entire Malay archipelago, who managed to avoided first the spread of Islam then the rise of Christianity through European colonization, practice animism. Buddhism is also present.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><span class="large"><strong>The Malays </strong></span><br>http://www.oldmaps.mu/History/Malays.htm<br><br>Among the major ethnolinguistic groups in the world, the nusantarian family (also called "Malayo-Polynesian" or "Austronesian" by western authors) undeniably occupied the largest geographical territory prior the modern era. From east to west, this vast territory covered the area from Rapa-nui (Easter Island) to Madagascar, approximately 60% the circumference of the earth. From north to south, it included the island of Taiwan (Pekan, for the Nusantarian natives), the archipelago of Hawaii (from "Hava-iki" or "Little Java", to recollect the ancestral homeland of the Polynesian), and New Zealand (Aotearoa in Maori language).<br><br>Beyond this heartland, other regions were frequented by Nusantarians navigators, including the major part of the Pacific Ocean (to South America) and the Indonesian Ocean, as far as East Africa. [1]<br><br>The Indonesian voyaged the wide Pacific from Africa to Easter Island, from China to the coral seas of the south. The wanderings of these early Malays were remarkable achievements of navigation. They brought the sail into the Pacific nineteen centuries ago. The reading of the stars was known to them, as was the making of charts. That these voyages took place at an early date is suggested by the fact that as early as BC 2300 the Chinese had charted the heavens to pave the way for the navigator.<br><br>The Arabic "Book of Miracles" describes a voyage of three hundred ships made to Madagascar in 945. It is possible that the African coast was reached at this early date.<br><br>In all likelihood, the island was discovered in the first centuries of the common era by seafarers from central Indonesia, related to the ancestors of the present people of Southeast Kalimantan.[7] One wonders what drove them so far to the west. In the current state of knowledge, there is obviously no answer to that question. However, it is likely that those people were not the only Nusantarians who frequented the western part of the Indonesian Ocean during that era.<br><br>In fact, the Melayu traders (namely, the Melayu speaking Nusantarians kingdoms, the most prominent being one named "Funan" by Chinese authors) traded between the Sea of China and the coastal countries of the Indonesian Ocean, as far as the Roman empire, to the northwest.[8]<br><br>And probably, presence of Melayu in that region might have contributed to the process of hinduization of Southeast Asia. While the Merina's ancestors slowly undertook the exploration and colonization of Madagascar, others Nusantarians traded actively with the African coasts and the Middle East. The items traded were mostly spices, ivory, cowries, pearls, hides, slaves, and perhaps silk. It is highly probable (as referenced in some Arabic texts) that Melayu trading posts were established on the coasts of Africa.[9].<br><br>Mauritius was visited, but not settled, by early Malay mariners<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><span class="large"><strong>The Malays - A People of Fascinating Divisions </strong></span><br><br>By John Tiffany<br><br>References to "the Malay" no doubt conjure mental impressions of a people long particular to Indonesia and its surrounding areas. But Malay bloodlines run strong from the Philippines to Madagascar. They constitute possibly the worldÂ’s most culturally and linguistically fractioned subrace.<br><br>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br><br>The Malay people might reasonably be called "the Vikings of the Orient." Magnificent instinctive shipbuilders, renowned as among the worldÂ’s finest sailors, they take to the water like fish, and conquered a goodly portion of the globe before being themselves "discovered" by Europeans. Indeed, they crossed the Indian Ocean to discover and settle the island of Madagascar at a time when Europeans, by and large, were still steering fearfully clear of the open ocean.<br><br>Mighty mariners and master traders, many of these seafaring tribes possess the amazing art of psycho-navigation, finding their way through the vast oceans by a sort of sixth sense.<br><br>At one time, when Europeans were sailing around in small, clumsy caravels, the Malays possessed the largest ships on the planet. Even today, the great Malay ships known as prahus (or praus) may be seen scything through the seas, the largest working sailing ships left in the world. They are shaped like the galleons of dreams, streaming softly into port under thousands of feet of black canvas. (Blair, Lawrence, Ring of Fire: Exploring the Last Remote Places of the World.)<br><br>Associated with the Malayo-Polynesian, or as it is nowadays called, the Austronesian civilization, are mysterious mega liths and more than one remarkable script of unknown, but certainly considerable antiquity.<br><br>Like the Vikings, the Malays comprise one of the great seafaring civilizations and spread their culture, language and racial stock all over two vast oceans and three or four continents. Yet there are also significant differences. The Malays have always disliked land interiors, settling generally along coastlines and avoiding the highlands. The Vikings, in contrast, penetrated deeply into Russia, traveling overland and by rivers and inland seas as far as Persia.<br><br>In a way the Malays could be described as less "mature" than the Germanic peoples, in that they are quick to laugh, quick to anger, and generally take life less seriously. They have been accused of being hard to hold to their word, and of failing to recognize the value of private property rights. And they are also unusual in their reluctance to form a true nation; their loyalties have as a rule been confined to their family, their tribe, and their locality. Even when they have formed "empires" in the past, these have not been states in the modern sense so much as city-states to which outlying territories might render tribute, but rarely allowed the "capital" to interfere in local affairs.<br><br>The fascinating part of the globe which we may call "the Malay world" has touched America more than most people are aware. Christopher Colum bus was sailing in search of the Spice Islands, it is generally believed, when he landed on Caribbean shores. And England acquired Manhattan from the Dutch in a swap: Manhattan for one of the chief islands from which cloves are obtained.<br><br>But the Malay world is infinitely more important relative to prehistory and some schools of human evolution.<br><br>Java is the home of the so-called Java Man (originally labeled Pithecanthropus erectus by scientists, but later reclassified as Homo erectus). This is thought to be an extinct ape-man or man-ape, using stone tools and dating from as long ago as one million years B.C. to some 250,000 B.C.; in a time when great ice sheets a mile or so in thickness still covered much of North America and Northwestern Europe.<br><br>Controversy swirls around another fossil hominid, Solo Man, found in central Java. Some scholars classify Solo Man as an intermediate species dating from perhaps 250,000 years ago, and claim him as evidence of a Southeast Asian evolutionary descent from H. erectus to H. sapiens. Others insist Solo Man was simply an advanced race of H. erectus who survived for a while in isolation, then died out completely.<br><br>How a proto-human such as H. erectus wound up in such a seemingly out-of-the-way place as Java is at first glance a mystery, as is the presence of the orangutan on the island of Borneo, the land of the singing fish (see MacDonald). And how did the negritos, the Papuans and other primitive people arrive at these islands, if, as is generally assumed, they originated on the mainland of Eurasia or Africa? Conversely, if they had their start in the islands, how did they get to the continents? These people seem to have neither the knowledge nor the ability to build any sort of seaworthy vessel, even a raft.<br><br>The likely explanation for how primitives got to such places as Indonesia and Malaysia, the Philippines, New Guinea, Australia and Madagascar becomes evident when we examine a map of the area during the Pleistocene era. The surface of the ocean then was at todayÂ’s 40 fathom line, and vast areas now submerged were then above water. Indeed, it was possible to walk from the mainland of Asia to all of Malaysia, including the island of Borneo (this entire area was one landmass, called by geologists Sundaland), and to the Philippines, and it appears that man followed in the footsteps of elephants, rhinoceri and stegodons along this route.<br><br>All Southeast Asian H. sapiens fossils prior to about 5,000 B.C. are of the type known as Bacson-Hoabinhians (because their culture was first recognized from the provinces of Hoa-binh, Hoa-nan, and Tan-hoa, in VietnamÂ’s Bacson mountains). The cave-dwelling Hoabinhians have been identified as members of the Australoid Veddoid group of peoples, who survive in isolated pockets in Malaya and the Philippines today. (The Toalas of southern Celebes would be examples of the Veddoid type.)<br><br>The Hoabinhians seem to have been of a commanding stature, six feet or so tall, with heavy bones, and possessed of large skulls with massive jaws and well-developed brow ridges. Their only known products were crudely chipped hand axes that can only with some difficulty be recognized as tools rather than naturally occurring rocks. Their skeletons are remarkably similar to present- day Melanesians, such as the people of New Caledonia and the Loyalty Islands. It is therefore thought that Australoids were the original "modern men" of this part of the globe, and that they were absorbed, driven to the uplands or pushed eastward by waves of Caucasoid and Mongoloid migration. These first modern men of the area seem to have been cannibals, as crushed human bones are found alongside discarded shells and debris of such prey animals as tapirs, elephants, deer and rhinoceri.<br><br>The first human burials and partial cremations in the area date from about 20,000 B.C. The first cave paintings in the region (mainly hand stencils but also human and animal figures) may be 10,000 or more years old and come from southwestern Sulawesi and New Guinea.<br><br>We know that the Malay region today contains races ranging from such primitive forms of humanity as the dwarf negritos, the Papuans and the Kubus, to the highly civilized Indian-Javanese, who more than 600 years ago built such fabulous monuments as the Buddhist Borobudur (Barabodur) and the Hindu chandi Prambanan. These jewels of Oriental art are noted for their magnificent sculptures and reliefs. It is a mystery why Hinduism was unable to disseminate itself over vast territories as did Buddhism, its penetration being limited to the Malay archipelago, Cambodia and Champa. Nevertheless, it struck root there so deeply that, like Buddhism, its influence has persisted down to the present day. (See Bosch for an analysis of this puzzle.)<br><br>On the small island of Bali, separated from Java by a strait only two miles wide, are found various relict groups, survivals of earlier times. First there are the majority of Balinese, who are Hin dus. In ancient times, Java was Hindu, but it was taken over by Mos lems. In Bali, Islam seems never to have achieved a foothold.<br><br>At one time Bali was populated by a race referred to by Covarrubias (Island of Bali) as "pure Indonesians", the Bali Aga. These people still have their own villages, from which outsiders, including other Balinese, are rigid ly excluded.<br><br>The negritos or Semang, although believed to be more recent arrivals than the Australoids and closely related Veddoids, are the most primitive race in Southeast Asia and the Malay Archipelago. These small and black woolly-headed nomads are of the same stock as the Aetas of the Phil ip pines and the Min copies of the Andaman Islands. They build neither houses nor boats but sleep around an open fire under a leafy shelter propped up by a stick.<br><br>Living in family groups with no tribal organization, they fear thunder and lightning and draw blood from their shins to appease the unseen powers that cause them. For their food they depend on what they can gather or kill with their blowguns and poison arrows. The negritos speak Mon-Khmer-related languages. These tongues belong to the Austro asiatic language family, not to be confused with the Austronesian language family which includes the other indigenous languages of modern Malaysia, in cluding Malay. It is believed the Aus tro asiatic language family was once found over the whole of the southern Indo chinese mainland.<br><br>Both the negritos and the Melanesians are believed to be of basically Australoid inheritance. Despite some marked resemblances, such as short stature, dark skin and kinky hair, the African pygmies (the only pure- blooded Negroes) and the Asian-Oce anic negritos have different origins, and their similarities are probably the reflection of adaptation to similar environmental conditions. (See Bellwood.) The negritos appear to have evolved in situ from their more typically Australoid ancestors, over a period of tens of thousands of years, possibly having lost contact with related population groups when the water level rose at the end of the last ice age. Genetic studies indicate that the Luzon and Mindanao negritos have probably been separated from each other for at least 10,000 years.<br><br>Far higher on the scale of evolution are the taller, fair-skinned, wavy-haired semi-nomadic Sakai or Senoi of the mountains and foothills of Malaysia. They are a cinnamon-colored people of "Indonesian" racial stock, but their language, interestingly enough, is mainly Mon-Annam or (AKA) Mon-Khmer.<br><br>In the southern half of Malaysia are found primitive tribes whose "proto-Malay" (AKA Austronesian or Malayo-Polynesian) ancestors trekked down, according to one theory, from what is now Yunnan and overran Indochina. These Jakun, as they call themselves, speak a pure form of Malay, unmixed with Sanskrit and other foreign loan words, but racially some of them have absorbed so much Australo-Melanesoid blood that they cannot readily be distinguished from Papuans, being big, black and bearded.<br><br>The Encyclopedia Britannica (Volume 17, London and New York) states that MadagascarÂ’s natives, collectively known as Malagasy, "are divided into a considerable number of tribes, each having its distinct customs." Although geographically an African island on the Indian Ocean, the Encyclopedia notes that "the majority of its inhabitants are derived, the lighter portion of them from the Malayo-Polynesian stock, and the darker races from the Melanesian. This is inferred from their similarity to the peoples of the Indian and Pacific archipelagoes in their physical appearance, mental habits, customs and, above all, in their language. The Negroid influence is derived from slaves brought from nearby Africa by Arab traders. Whereas indigenous Malays traveled 2,000 miles in countless voyages to first discover and then colonize Madagascar, Negroes could not navigate 200 miles from Africa.<br><br>Madagascar is 800 miles long and about 200 miles wide at one point. Unlike most Malay concentrations, the Encyclopedia states that Â“The most striking proof of the virtual unity of the inhabitants of Madagascar is that substantially but one language is spoken over the whole country.Â” The Malay origin of the Malagasy were noted by Westerners in the 16th century. The Malagasy never devised a written language (consequently producing no manuscripts or inscriptions). Their language was eventually reduced to writing by English missionaries.<br><br>Madagascar remains a temperate, tranquil and rather idyllic place, underpopulated by elements not particularly interested in the chaos of the outside world. Even today, some wonder: What if the "final solution" plan devised by the Polish government in the late 1930s and cribbed by the Germans (to create a state for EuropeÂ’s Jews on Madagascar) had not been bashed to smithereens by World War II? Would not a terrible and bloody burden have been averted; the postwar creation of that Jewish state in Palestine?<br><br>The proto-Malays are shorter and darker than the "Malays proper" and are believed to have been a mixture of Caucasoid and Mongoloid peoples, while a later wave of Malays, called the "deutero-Malays", were entirely Mongoloid. The American anthropologist H. Otley Beyer, who lived in the Philippines most of his life, believed these two waves occurred something like 5,000 and 3,500 years B.C., respectively.<br><br>Another theory is that the Malays did not come from mainland Asia, but originated in the Minangkabau area, where they are still found today. The Minang kabau or Minang people are known as the most advanced and educated in Indonesia, living in their saddle-roofed traditional houses, set on stilts, with palm-fiber roofs and walls covered in ornate carvings, like the Torajas of the highlands of Celebes. They are matrilineal, with property and power passing from mother to daughter.<br><br>The proto-Malays are the ancestors of the Ibans and most of the Dayaks of Borneo (Dyaks, AKA Land Dayaks, to distinguish them from the Ibans, who are sometimes called the Sea Dayaks). The proto-Malay type also survives in the Bataks of Sumatra, the islanders of Nias, and the Torajas, noted for their ship- shaped houses and their strange burial rites (the bodies are placed in niches cut into the faces of vertical cliffs, where Â“tau-tauÂ” effigies of the dead are erected to stare out at the living). The Torajas still erect megaliths and have a most unusual form of writing in which each letter looks like a mandala or posy. (The Buginese also have an ancient, i.e., pre-Hindu, script, in which, it is said, each letter resembles the cross section of a different spiral seashell.)<br><br>We also find proto-Malays today in the Igorot and Ifugao of northern Luzon. They tend to be frank and open people and are excellent farmers. They probably represent the primitive Malay type, little affected by foreign influences.<br><br>The nomadic Punan (or Penan) Dyaks of central Borneo, a fascinating subtribe of non-headhunters, are, in terms of their racial appearance, as purely Mongoloid as any people on earth. The lovely, Â“toplessÂ” young maidens of this Â“lost tribe,Â” whose very existence is denied by the Indonesian government, perform a kind of water music by slapping their cupped hands against the surface of a nameless, uncharted river. A kind of Â“Borneo bluegrassÂ” is also played after dark on the nose flute and two strange stringed instruments, the satung and the sapeh.<br><br>The Punans find their way through the dense jungles of Borneo by psycho-navigation, like the Australian aborigines, the Dinka of the Sahara and the Bugis seafaring tribes. They are re nowned as the finest weavers of rattan in the world and are noted for their beads, of astonishing age and variety, including beads identical to those extracted from Mesopotamian graves 2,300 years old. Little is known of the PunansÂ’ religion, save that they worship Aping, the forest god.<br><br>The deep jungle natives of Borneo include not only the Punans, but the Muruts (who speak several different languages), and various other peoples. In Sabah, there are the Muruts and the Kadazan (formerly called the Dusun). The Kadazan, like the Muruts, speak several different languages. These Mon go loid tribes look very much alike to the untrained eye, but each has its own characteristic social organization and customs. To some extent they have influenced one another since emigrating to the island, but many differences still distinguish their various groups. In particular, they have not evolved a common language, although they have lived for ages as neighbors on the same rivers. They speak a multiplicity of unconnected tongues, each incomprehensible to the next-door communities upstream or downstream (see MacDonald).<br><br>Coates disputes the theory of a Chi nese origin for the prehistoric Aus tro nesian or proto-Malay civilization (also called the Pacific or Oceanic civilization). He argues that it is of Pacific origin, perhaps having its starting point in the Gilbert Islands, approximately 4,500 miles east of Java (Islands of the South, by Austin Coates). Whatever the origin of the Austronesian culture, a key fact is that these Caucasoid Malayo-Polynesian people, at their height, spanned the globe from Tahiti and perhaps Easter Island to Madagascar. (An Â“IndonesianÂ” group of tribes in Madagascar is believed to be descended from settlers from the Sulu Islands.)<br><br>Unfortunately, because of the presence of a large mass of incompatible Mela nesians in their center, who were regarded and treated by the majority of Malays as an inferior and unmarriageable people, the Malay- Polynesians became split into an eastern civilization, the Poly nesians, and a western civilization, the Malays and Indonesians, each of which lost all knowledge of their Â“other half.Â”<br><br>The difference between the continental mind and the Austro nesian mind is illustrated by this contrast: Water, in the form of the endless ocean to the west, was the major obstacle for European explorers in their discovery of the New World. But the Gilbert Islanders have an oral history telling of their own discovery of South America in the distant past. On sighting the Andes after an ocean voyage of four months, they were far from pleased, and according to legend, turned around and sailed in disgust back toward their native atolls. They described South America as Â“Maiwa,Â” the wall at the side of the world, four moonsÂ’ sail to the eastward, a land which stretches to the north and to the south without end: Â“beyond the furthest eastward island it lies, a wall of mountains up against the sun.Â” To these islanders, a continent was an obstacle; to Westerners, an ocean was the obstacle.<br><br>The prehistoric Austronesian civilization included the island of Ceylon in the west and the Philippines in the east. Today the Filipinos are considerably sinified, some Filipinos being racially almost indistinguishable from the Chinese. Ceylon (now Sri Lanka) has been even more heavily indianized, and shows no surviving traces of any Malayo-Poly nesian speech. Yet in both these areas much of the Austronesian lifestyle and manner have survived.<br><br>The Philippines are the home of eight different Â“civilized peoples,Â” sometimes referred to as tribes. There are the Visayans, Tagalogs, Ilocanos, Bicols, Pangasinans, Pampangans, Cagayans and the Zambalans. However, the loose use of the word Â“tribesÂ” to designate these peoples is very misleading. The truth is that they are the descendants of originally distinct tribes or peoples which have gradually come to resemble each other. There is a marked tendency of the Tagalogs and the Visayans to impose their will on the others. The actual differences between a Tagalog and a Visayan are not great, from an American point of view, but the Tagalogs and Visayans consider them to be considerable.<br><br>Oddly as it may seem, there are more sharply distinct dialects spoken in the Philippines than there are peoples. The Visayans, for example, are split three ways among speakers of Cebuano, Ilongo and Cuyuno.<br><br>Some Filipinos have wanted to alter their racial stocks by an infusion of white blood. Juan Araneta, a very intelligent Visayan of Negro ancestry, stated around the turn of the 20th century that white blood is the only hope for his people, that if he had his way he would jail every American soldier who did not leave at least three children behind him.<br><br>Besides the civilized peoples, there are also the Ifugao, the Igorot, the Manobo, and the Bukidnon, and the wild Tingians of Apayao, who proved the most difficult of the hill tribes of northern Luzon to bring under effective governmental control. There, as in Borneo, headhunting is connected with religious beliefs and observances. As recently as 1967, there were massive genocidally-flavored outbreaks of headhunting and cannibalism by the Dayaks of Borneo.<br><br>There is little racial difference be tween southern India and Ceylon, but culturally they are worlds apart. As Coates notes: Â“The faces on either side of the Palk Strait [separating India from Ceylon] look the same, but whereas in South India they were mournful and solemn, in Ceylon they are cheerful and one hears laughter. It is an entirely different and more relaxed atmosphere, itself a subtle reminder of the Austro nesian character, which everywhere left its imprint.Â”<br><br>Austronesia, as a culture, formerly extended deeply into Southern Asia, including the Indochinese peninsula, much of southern China and northeastern India. The enlargement and expansion of the continental civilizations of the Orient, and in particular the southward expansion of the Chinese culture (which in turn caused large numbers of adjacent peoples, such as Burmese, Thais and Vietnamese to move south into Indochina) had the effect of submerging the Austronesian culture there. Some of the tribal peoples in Burma, southern China and northeastern India, such as the Nagas, represent remote surviving enclaves of Austronesian influence.<br><br>The relationship between the Malay and Polynesian languages is not disputed. Certain Moi dialects in southern Annam are also related to this language family. Even the Mundas of Chota Nagpur in India present rather striking likenesses to the Â“pre-MalaysÂ” and the Mois.<br><br>Records of actual events in Singapore do not appear until about the 14th century A.D. By this time the island was a small but flourishing center of trade. It had acquired the name, of unknown derivation, of Temasek, which has been interpreted by some as meaning Â“Sea TownÂ” and by others as meaning Â“Place of Festivals.Â” The name Â“Singapore,Â” or Sing a pura, was later bestowed upon Tem a sek by the Hindus. But Swetten ham argues that Temasek is not a Malay term at all, and is itself of very ancient South Indian origin. Singa is Sanskrit for Â“lionÂ” and pura for Â“town.Â”<br><br>Megalithic monuments are known from the southern Malay peninsula and northern Borneo, as well as in some other locations in the Malay world. One of those places is Sumba, an island south of Komodo, which is the home of the famous Â“dragonsÂ” (actually giant, carnivorous lizards). These megaliths are still raised to honor the dead.<br><br>Throughout the Malay archipelago, the sea serves as a link with other peoples. The larger islands have many sizable rivers which are navigable by ship and in places cut through thick jungle which would otherwise be inaccessible, making sea transport essential to the life of the people. The decoration of boats is a cultural necessity, and the decorations are connected with the peopleÂ’s concepts of the cosmic system. Great care is devoted to their execution, and among them are found examples of the highest artistic skill.<br><br>Over the centuries the Malay peninsula area developed into a conglomeration of small sovereign Malay states which proved too weak to resist the encroachments of a succession of outside imperialistic powers. They fell under the empires based in Sumatra, Java or Siam. Not until the century did the indigenous people succeed in gaining control of their own destiny. For a few glorious decades, the whole peninsula formed part of a great Malay empire, with its center in the fortified city of Malice (Malacca).<br><br>Malacca was founded by the piratical Hindu prince called Parameswara (mean ing prince consort). He had been forced to flee from Palembang in his native Sumatra in 1377 (when his father- in-law, who ruled the empire of Maj Apahit, Java, destroyed the city for declaring independence) to Old Singa pore, which was then known as Tuma sek. After only eight days in Tumasek, Parameswara had the local ruler, his host, killed, and took control of the city. This ruler had been the son-in-law of the king of Siam, who ordered the ruler of Patani to punish Parameswara by destroying Singapore.<br><br>Parameswara was, in turn, forced to flee from Singapore and wound up at Malacca after an undetermined period in Muar. By cleverly converting to Islam and marrying the daughter of the sultan of Pasai about 1414, Parameswara (who now took on the title of Megat Iskandar Shah) was able to make his new town of Malacca the great trading center he wished it to be.<br><br>Malacca was destined to become the center from which Islam spread throughout the region. The religion was brought there from northern Sumatra (the states of Pasai and Perlak), where it had been established by traders from India, mostly by Gujerati merchants from the northwest of India, although a convincing case has been made for Islam first having been introduced into Sumatra by merchants from the Coromandel coast. The Hikayat Raja Pasai states that Islam came from south India.<br><br>The fact that Islam was brought to this heavily Hinduized region by Indians rather than by Arabs was key to the rapid and peaceful spread of the new religion, as the Moslem Indians did not seek to change traditional customs very much. By about 1414, there was a fairly numerous Moslem trading community in the city. Malacca itself was now firmly established, with the support and protection of the Ming emperors of China, who were useful allies against the Siamese.<br><br>During the 15th century Malacca rose to become, in the words of Tome Pires, the 16th century Portuguese apothecary and historian, Â“of such importance and profit that it seems to me it has no equal in the world.Â” Although building upon an illustrious past, these were the glory days of the Malay people, in which were established a pattern of government and a lifestyle which was emulated by subsequent Malay kingdoms and became the basis of what was later termed traditional Malay culture and statecraft.<br><br>For all its glory, however, Malacca never really succeeded in making the Malay straits its private lake. The northern Malay states of Patani, Kelantan, Trengganu and Kedah continued for a long time to acknowledge the overlordship of Ayudhya (Thailand), and only toward the end of the 15th century was MalaccaÂ’s influence really felt there. Even on the opposite side of the strait, Pasai continued as an independent port able to satisfy foreign traders, and Aur too continued to retain its autonomy.<br><br>Amok, the "Malay malaise", is one of the few Malay words to enter into the English language, along with ketchup (catsup). The Malays are a very sensitive people, easily offended, with a tendency to contain their anger and hold a grudge. A person who ran amok would be a typical Malay man who broods over a real or fancied affront until he becomes enraged, running through the streets of his village slashing anyone within reach with a machete-like instrument.<br><br>In racial terms IndonesiaÂ’s population, consisting of hundreds of tribes and ethnic groups, is basically of Malay stock. There are at least 14 major ethnic groups in Indonesia: Atjehnese, Batak, Minan g kabau, Coastal Malay, Sundanese, Java nese, Madurese, Balinese, Dyaks, Makas sarese, Buginese, Torajas, Menandonese, Ambonese, and perhaps a few others. We must not forget the East Timorese, victims of an anti-Christian holocaust starting in 1975. Isolated fighting still continues in East Timor. It remains a very sensitive topic politically. East Timor has been closed to tourists by the Indonesian government.<br><br>Each ethnic group in Indonesia occupies its own region, speaks its own language and possesses its own forms of social organization. These communities have a sense of distinctness and a local pride that tend in some circumstances to take precedence over feelings of loyalty to the Â“nationÂ” (more accurately described as an empire) of Indonesia. Java, of course, has more than half the population of the entire empire, making the ethnic distribution of power quite a lopsided one.<br><br>Recent excavations at two sites in northern Thailand have revealed that a metal-using culture was under way there in the fourth millennium B.C.Â—much earlier than in either China or India. This discovery has overturned the conception of Southeast Asia as a backwater of prehistory, and some experts now speculate that the area was in fact one of the cradles of human cultural development. Archeology has uncovered numerous sites in present-day Kedah which may one day reveal the existence of an important center of civilization in northern Malaya and southern Thailand, according to Ryan. The Malay peninsulaÂ’s most important relics of the bronze age, oddly enough, are two kettledrumsÂ—one was revealed by a flood in Pahang, and the other was dug up in Selangor by the Japanese in 1944.<br><br>Of Thailand (whose name means Â“Land of the FreeÂ”), it is interesting to note that the Thais themselves are relative newcomers to what we now call Thailand, having arrived there from China only about 1,000 years ago. The older name for the country, Siam, etymologically means Â“dark brown people,Â” evidently a reference to the difference in skin color by a lighter colored people. Whether this term was first employed by the natives to describe the Thai invaders or vice versa remains problematical.<br><br>Fossils of H. sapiens have been found in China and mainland Southeast Asia dating from as early as 60,000 B.C. This compares favorably with the ap pear ance of modern man in other parts of the world, although two imprecisely dated African fossils are said to be more than 90,000 years old. (One theory, as yet neither proved nor disproved, is that modern man could have evolved separately in different regions.) Modern man is known to have inhabited Indonesia, New Guinea and Aus tralia about 40,000 years ago, and possibly earlier.<br><br>The empire of Srivajaya (Shrivajaya) in south Sumatra was, from the second half of the seventh to the 13th century A.D., the greatest of the Indonesian sea powers, after Java. Some of the major classical kingdoms and Islamic principalities were Malacca in the north, Melayu and Srivijaya in Sumatra, and Minangkabau on the west coast<br><br>In the 13th century, Marco Polo and Rustichello wrote of the numerous Malay kingdoms of the time, which Polo visited after departing from Japan: Chamba; Â“JavaÂ”; Lokak; the island of Malayur; Â“Lesser JavaÂ” with at least eight kingdoms including Ferlec and Basman (where they had wild elephants and Â“unicorns as big as the elephantsÂ”), the Â“kingdom of Sumatra,Â” Dagroian, Lambri and Fansur. He also visited the mysterious island of Gauenispola, and the Nicobar and Andaman islands, before moving on to Ceylon. Back in Europe, Polo was scorned for his tall tales of people actually eating the nests of birds, which they boiled over fires of burning black stones. Centuries would elapse before the same black stones would be discovered in Europe, where they would fuel the Industrial Revolution.<br><br>The Bugis from the Celebes Islands (especially the port of Macassar) were (and still are) renowned as excellent sailors and mercenary soldiers. They were hired as mercenaries by Sultan Ibra him of Johore in the late 17th century. But once having visited the peninsula, the ferocious Bugis proved hard to get rid of, and were a rising influence throughout the 18th century, despite the very real fear of the fierce Bugis pirates.<br><br>It must be noted that once the Dutch gained power in the region, they could not allow a port such as Macassar to compete with them. They conquered it in the 17th century and ruined its trade. This is what forced the Bugis to take up the occupation of piracy. They had learned to use guns and body armor from the Portuguese, and many a South east Asian ruler called on them for help in war.<br><br>The most complicated galleys de signed outside the Mediter ranean were Malay. Indeed, while most of their oared craft were single banked, one trireme that was sketched about 1767 had a hull about 105 feet long and 16 feet wide, with double outriggers projecting about 26 feet. There were 25 rowers in each bank and, for added zip, 18 more paddlers on each outrigger.<br><br>The Malay pirates were renowned seamen whose skill, daring and just plain lust for blood were the equal of anyone who ever raised the Jolly Roger. Even today, the great Bugis prahus may be seen scything through the seas, the largest working sailing ships left in the world, shaped like the galleons of dreams, streaming softly into port under thousands of feet of black canvas.

            <div class='col-md body'><span class="large"><strong>THE MIGRATION OF THE HAWAIIANS</strong></span><br>http://www.sacred-texts.com/pac/hloh/hloh05.htm<br><br>THE fountain source of the Mississippi has been discovered and rediscovered. The origin of the Polynesian race has been a subject for discovery and rediscovery. The older theory of Malay origin as set forth in the earlier encyclopÃ¦dias is now recognized as untenable. The Malays followed the Polynesians rather than preceded them. The comparative study of Polynesian legends leads almost irresistibly to the conclusion that the Polynesians were Aryans, coming at least from India to Malasia and possibly coming from Arabia, as Fornander of Hawaii so earnestly argues. It is now accepted that the Polynesians did not originate from Malay parentage, and that they did occupy for an indefinite period the region around the Sunda Straits from Java to the Molucca Islands, and also that the greater portion of the Polynesians was driven out from this region and scattered over the Pacific in the early part of the Christian Era. The legends that cluster around Wakea have greatly aided in making plain some<br><br>{p. 2}<br><br>things concerning the disposition of the Polynesians. By sifting the legends of Hawaii-loa we learn how the great voyager becomes one of the first Vikings of the Pacific. His home at last is found to be Gilolo of the Molucca Islands. From the legends we become acquainted with Wakea (possibly meaning "noonday," or "the white time") and his wife Papa (earth), the most widely remembered of all the ancestors of the Polynesian race. Their names are found in the legends of the most prominent island groups, and the highest places are granted them among the demi-gods and sometimes among the chief deities. Their deeds belong to the most ancient times--the creation or discovery of the various islands of the Pacific world. Those who worshipped Wakea and Papa are found in such widely separated localities that it must be considered impossible for even a demi-god to have had so many homes. Atea, or Wakea, was one of the highest gods of the Marquesas Islands. Here his name means "light." The Marquesans evidently look back of all their present history and locate Atea in the ancient homeland. Vatea in the Society Islands, Wakea in Hawaii and New Zealand, Makea, Vakea and Akea are phonetic variations of the one name when written down by the students who made a written form for words repeated from generation to generation by word of mouth<br><br>{p. 3}<br><br>alone. Even under the name "Wakea" this ancient chief is known in most widely separated islands. The only reasonable explanation for this widespread reference to Wakea is that he was an ancestor belonging in common to all the scattered Polynesians. It seems as if there must have been a period when Wakea was king or chief of a united people. He must have been of great ability and probably was the great king of the United Polynesians. If this were the fact it would naturally result that his memory would be carried wherever the dispersed race might go.<br><br>In the myths and legends of the Hervey Islands, Vatea is located near the beginning of their national existence. First of all the Hervey Islanders place Te-ake-ia-roe (The root of all existence). Then there came upon the ancient world Te Vaerua (The breath, or The life). Then came the god time--Te Manawa roa (The long ago). Then their creation legends locate Vari, a woman whose name means "the beginning," a name curiously similar to the Hebrew word "bara," "to create," as in Gen. i. 1. Her children were torn out of her breasts and given homes in the ancient mist-land, with which, without any preparation or introduction, Hawaiki is confused in a part of the legend. It has been suggested that this Hawaiki is Savaii of the<br><br>{p. 4}<br><br>Samoan Islands, from which the Hervey Islands may have had their origin in a migration of the Middle Ages. One of the children of Vari dwelt in "a sacred tabu island" and became the god of the fish. Another sought a home "where the red parrots' feathers were gathered"--the royal feathers for the high chiefs' garments. Another became the echo-god and lived in "the hollow gray rocks." Another as the god of the winds went far out "on the deep ocean." Another, a girl, found a home, "the silent land," with her mother. Wakea, or Vatea, the eldest of this family, remained in Ava-iki (Hawaii), the ancestral home--"the bright land of Vatea." Here he married Papa. This Ava-iki was to the Herveyites of later generations the fiery volcanic under-world. When the long sea-voyages ceased after some centuries, the islanders realized that Ava-iki was very closely connected with their history. They had but a misty idea of far-off lands, and they did know of earthquakes and lava caves and volcanic fires-so they located Ava-iki as the secret world under their islands. This under-world with legendary inconsistency was located on the ocean's surface, when it became necessary to have their islands discovered by the descendants of Vatea. According to the Hervey legends, Vatea was the father of Lono and Kanaloa, two of the great gods of the Polynesians. {p. 5} They were twins. Lono had three sons, whom he sent away. They sailed out through many heavens and from Ava-iki pulled up out of the deep ocean two of the Hervey Islands. The natives of the Hervey group supposed that the horizon around their group enclosed the world. Beyond this world line were heavens and heavens. A daring voyager by sailing through the sky-line would break out from this world into an unknown world or a heaven bounded by new horizons. Strangers "broke through" from heaven, sometimes making use of the path of the sun. Thus about twenty-five generations ago Raa (possibly Laa, the Hawaiian) broke down the horizon's bars and established a line of kings in Raiatea. So also when Captain Cook came to the Hervey Islands the natives said: "Whence comes this strange thing? It has climbed up [come up forcibly] from the thin land, the home of Wakea." He had pierced the western heavens from which their ancestors had come.<br><br>When the sons of Lono unexpectedly saw a speck of land far away over the sea, they cried out that here was a place created for them by their deified ancestors. As they came nearer they "pulled up" the islands until they grew to be high mountains rising from the deep waters. In these mountains they found the lava caves<br><br>{p. 6}<br><br>and deep chasms which they always said extended down under the seas back to Ava-iki. They made their caves a passageway for spirits to the fairy home of the dead, and therefore into certain chasms cast the bodies of the dead, that the spirit might more easily find the path to the under-world.<br><br>Vatea was a descendant of "the long ago," according to the Hervey legend. Wakea of Hawaii was a son of Kahiko, "the ancient." Wakea's home is more definitely stated in the Hawaiian than in the Hervey legends. He lived in O-Lolo-i-mehani, or The Red Lolo, a name confidently referred by Fornander in "The Polynesian Race" to Gilolo, the principal island of the Moluccas. The Red Lolo, as suggested by Fornander, would refer not alone to volcanic action and its decaying debris, but would fittingly designate the largest and most important island of the group. The fire bursting from many volcanoes in the region of the Sunda Straits was "royal" to the beholders, who felt that divine power was present in the mysterious red flames. Hence all the Polynesian tribes invested the red color with especial dignity as a mark of royalty and pre-eminence. It was on the banners allowed only to chiefs when their boats sailed away to visit distant lands. It was the color of the war cloaks of chiefly warriors. In<br><br>{p. 7}<br><br>the recent days of the monarchy of Hawaii, the richest crimson was the only color allowed in upholstering the great throne room. Gilolo might worthily bear the name "The Red Lolo" in Hawaiian story. Here Hawaii-loa, the first of the Polynesian Vikings, had his home. Here the Chieftainess Oupe, a Polynesian princess, dwelt. In O-Lolo Wakea married the granddaughter of Oupe, whose name was Papa. She is almost as widely known in legends as her husband. Papa was said to be a tabued descendant of Hawaii-loa and therefore superior in rank to Wakea. Papa is described as "very fair and almost white." Her name means "earth," and Wakea's name might mean "noonday." This, with the many experiences through which they both passed, would lay the foundation for a very pretty sun-myth, but we cannot avoid the human aspect of the legends and give them both a more worthy position as ancestors of a scattered people.<br><br>Kahiko, the ancient, is recorded as having had three sons, from whom descended the chiefs, the priests and the common people,--the husbandmen,--almost a Shem, Ham and Japheth division. Other legends, however, give Kahiko only two sons, the eldest, Wakea, having power both as chief and priest. All the legends unite in making Wakea the head of the class of chiefs. This would very readily explain the<br><br>{p. 8}<br><br>high place held by Wakea throughout Polynesia and also the jealous grasp upon genealogical records maintained by the royal families of the Pacific.<br><br>Wakea and Papa are credited with being the creators of many island kingdoms of the Pacific. Sometimes the credit is given partly to a mischievous fisherman-god, Maui, after whom one of the Hawaiian Islands is named. One of the Hawaiian legends goes back to the creation or discovery of Hawaii and ascribes the creation of the world to Wakea and Papa. The two were living together in "Po"--"darkness," or "chaos." Papa brought into existence a gourd calabash including bowl and cover, with the pulp and seeds inside. Wakea threw the cover upward and it became heaven. From the pulp and seeds he made the sky and the sun and moon and stars. From the juice of the pulp he made the rain. The bowl he fashioned into the land and sea. Other legends limit the creative labors of Wakea to the Hawaiian group. With the aid of Papa he established a portion of the islands; then discord entered the royal family and a separation was decided upon. The Hawaiian custom has always been for either chief or chiefess to exercise the right to divorce and to contract the marriage ties. Wakea is said to have divorced Papa by spitting in her face, according to an ancient<br><br>{p. 9}<br><br>custom. Wakea selected a chieftainess named Hina, from whom the island Molokai (the leper island) received the name "Molokai-hina"--the ancient name of the island. Morotai was also an island lying near Gilolo in the Molucca group, and might be the place from which Wakea secured his bride. Papa selected as her new husband a chief named Lua. The ancient name of Oahu (the island upon which Honolulu is located) was "Oahu-a-lua" (The Oahu of Lua). One of the Celebes Islands bears a name for one of its districts very similar to Oahu--"Ouadju." Papa seems to have been partially crazed by her divorce. She marries many husbands. She voyages back and forth between distant islands. In an ancient island, Tahiti, she bears children from whom the Tahitians claim descent. In the Celebes she and her people experience a. famine and she is compelled to send to O-Lolo for food. In New Zealand legend she becomes the wife of Langi (Hawaiian Lani, or heaven), a union of "earth" and "heaven." They have six children. Four of these are the chief gods of ancient Hawaii: Ka-ne, "light"; Ku, "the builder"; Lono, "sound"; and Kanaloa. Two of the children are not named in Hawaiian annals, unless it might be that one, Tawhirri, should be represented in Kahili, the tall standard used for centuries as the insignia of very high<br><br>{p. 10}<br><br>chief families. The other name, "Haumia," might possibly be Haumea, a second name given to Papa in the legends. The Maoris of New Zealand deify all of these six sons of Lani and Papa.<br><br>Ka-ne was "father of forests." He was very strong. In ancient days the sky was not separated from the earth. He lifted up the heavens and pushed down the earth--and thus made space for all things to grow. It was while the sky rested its full weight upon the earth that the leaves started into life, but were flat and thin because there was no chance to become plump and full like the fruit which came later. Here is the foundation for another sun-myth of the Pacific, wherein it might be said light came and separating darkness from the earth brought life into the world. Light could well be "the father of forests." The second son was Tawhirri, "the father of winds and storms." A part of his name was "matea," which might possibly be referred to Wakea. He dwelt in the skies with his father Lani.<br><br>The third son was Lono, who was "the father of all cultivated food."<br><br>The fourth was Haumia, "the father of uncultivated food"--such food as grew wild in the forests or among the herbs or in the midst of the edible sea-mosses.<br><br>The fifth son was Kanaloa, "the father of all<br><br>{p. 11}<br><br>reptiles and fishes," at first dwelling in Hawaiki on the land with all his descendants.<br><br>The sixth son was Ku "with the red face," "the father of fierce or cruel men." Ku was easily made angry, and after a time waged war against his brothers and their followers. There was great destruction, but Ku could not win the victory alone. He was compelled to call upon Tawhirri, "the father of winds and storms." Fierce men and fierce storms made it difficult for the remainder of the household to escape. The "father of forests" bowed to the earth under the terrific force of hurricanes and tornadoes. The "fathers of foods" buried themselves deep in the ground to escape destruction at the hands of cruel mankind and tempestuous nature. Then came the bitter conflict between the family of Kanaloa and their combined enemies. Cruel men were without pity in the blows dealt against their inferior kindred. At last the fish fled to the sea and sought safety in distant waters, finding homes where the children of Ku did not care to follow. The reptiles fled inland to the secret recesses of the mountains and forests. There they have kept their wild savage life through the centuries even to the present day, as in Sumatra, Borneo, the Celebes, the Philippines and other sections of the region around the Sunda Straits. They are not now ocean<br><br>{p. 12}<br><br>lovers any more than in the ages past. They do not "go down to the sea in ships." Neither do they love the coming of Dutch or Spanish or American civilization. They seem to have an hereditary dislike for strange and cruel men.<br><br>The sea rovers became great wanderers, carrying with them the name of "Kanaloa" and planting it in almost all the Pacific islands to be worshipped as one of the supreme gods.<br><br>How much these domestic troubles surrounding the name of Papa may have had to do with an early migration of the Polynesians we do not know. It may be that while the household was engaged in war the Malays came from the north and with tornado power scattered the divided family, compelling swift flight to distant lands. It is now understood that the great dispersion of the Polynesians came from the incursions of the powerful Malays during the second century of the Christian Era. Some of the Hawaiian and New Zealand legends imply that for a number of generations a part of the Polynesians remained in the old family home, Hawaiki. The New Zealanders enter quite fully into the account of the troubles attending the coming of their ancestors from Hawaiki. They mention battles and domestic discords. They tell of the long journeys and wearisome efforts put forth until their ancestors find Northern<br><br>{p. 13}<br><br>New Zealand, Ke-ao-tea-roa (The great white land). This was pulled up out of the sea for them by Maui with his wonderful fish-hook. This story of the magic fishing of the disobedient and mischievous Maui is common in Polynesia.<br><br>After the discovery of New Zealand, boats were sent back to Hawaiki to induce large companies of colonists to leave the land of warfare and trouble and settle in rich lands bordering the beautiful bays of New Zealand.<br><br>Like stories of discovery of new lands and return for friends adorn the legends of all Polynesia. Wakea's descendants were clannish and stood by each other in that great migration of the second century as well as in the better-remembered journeys of later years. There seems to have been a continued migration of the Polynesians. Sometimes they were apparently fought off by the black race, as in Australia; sometimes they held their own for a time, keeping the black men inland, as in Fiji; and sometimes they struck out boldly for new lands, as when they sailed long distances to the Hawaiian and Easter Islands. It is said that the purest forms of the Polynesian language, most harmonious with one another, were carried by the children of Wakea to the far distant islands of New Zealand, Hawaii and Easter Island.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Overseas Chinese<br>From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia.<br>Overseas Chinese (ÃˆAÂƒS in pinyin: huÂ¨Â¢qiÂ¨Â¢o, or ÃˆAÂ°Ã» huÂ¨Â¢bÂ¨Â¡o, or ÂƒSÂ°Ã» qiÂ¨Â¢obÂ¨Â¡o) are ethnic Chinese who live outside of Mainland China, Hong Kong, Macau, or Taiwan. There are approximately 60 million overseas Chinese mostly living in southeast Asia where they make up a majority of the population of Singapore and significant minority populations in Indonesia, the Philippines, Thailand, Vietnam and Malaysia. The overseas populations in those areas arrived between the 16th and the 19th centuries from mostly the maritime provinces of Guangdong and Fujian (the Hoklo ethnic group), followed by Taiwan and Hainan.<br><br>More recent emigration has been directed primarily to western countries such as United States, Canada and Australia being destinations. (see entries on Malaysian Chinese, Indonesian Chinese, Chinese Australians, Burmese Chinese, Chinese Singaporean, Chinese Canadian, Chinese Cuban, Chinese Filipino, Chinese Peruvian, Chinese Puerto Rican,Chinese Cayman Islander Chinese American, American-born Chinese, Taiwanese American and Chinese British).<br><br>Population (199<img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"> Area % Number<br>Asia 80 17,070,000<br>Americas 11.63 5,020,000<br>Europe 2.3 945,000<br>Oceania 1.28 564,000<br>Africa 0.3 126,000<br>Total 100 33,720,000<br><br>Overseas Chinese vary widely as to their degree of assimilation, their interactions with the surrounding communities (see Chinatown), and their relationship with China. In Thailand, overseas Chinese have largely intermarried and assimilated with the native community. In Myanmar, the Chinese rarely intermarry, but have adopted the Burmese culture, maintaining both Chinese and Burmese identities. On the other hand, in Malaysia and Singapore, overseas Chinese have maintained a distinct communal identity.<br><br>Often there are different waves of immigration leading to subgroups among overseas Chinese such as the new and old immigrants in Cambodia and Indonesia.<br><br>The Chinese in southeast Asian countries have often established themselves in commerce and finances. In North America, because of immigration policies, overseas Chinese tend to be found in professional occupations, including significant ranks in medicine and academia.<br><br>Both the People's Republic of China and the Republic of China on Taiwan maintain highly complex relationships with overseas Chinese populations. Both maintain cabinet level ministries to deal with overseas Chinese affairs, and many local governments within the PRC have overseas Chinese bureaus. Both the PRC and ROC have some legislative representation for overseas Chinese. In the case of the PRC, some seats in the National People's Congress are allocated for returned overseas Chinese. In the Legislative Yuan, there are a small number of seats allocated for overseas Chinese. These seats are apportioned to the political parties based on their vote totals on Taiwan, and then the parties assign the seats to overseas Chinese party loyalists.<br><br>During the 1950s and 1960s, the ROC tended to seek the support of overseas Chinese communities through branches of the Kuomintang based on Sun Yat-sen's use of expatriate Chinese communities to raise money for his revolution. During this period, the People's Republic of China tended to view overseas Chinese with suspicion as possible capitalist infiltrators and tended to value relationships with southeast Asian nations as more important than gaining support of overseas Chinese, and in the Bandung declaration explicitly stated that overseas Chinese owed primary loyalty to their home nation.<br><br>After the Deng Xiaoping reforms, the attitude of the PRC toward overseas Chinese changed dramatically. Rather than being seen with suspicion, they were seen as people which could aid PRC development via their skills and capital. During the 1980s, the PRC actively attempted to court the support of overseas Chinese by among other things, returning properties that were confiscated after the 1949 revolution. More recently PRC policy has attempted to maintain the support of recently emigrated Chinese, who consist largely of Chinese seeking graduate education in the West.<br><br>Overseas Chinese have sometimes played an important role in Chinese politics. Most of the funding for the Chinese revolution of 1911 came from overseas Chinese, and many overseas Chinese are overseas for political reasons. Many overseas Chinese are now investing in mainland China providing financial resources, social and cultural networks, contacts and opportunities.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>this is all so meaningless...<br><br>the history of the spread of islam is NOT the history of this region. by tracing it from malacca, it is already fatally flawed.<br><br>what about the indianised kingdom? what about angkor wat? what about borobudor? what about champa and annam? what about theravada buddhism?<br><br>islam is just another religion (and a relative late-comer at that) in this very diverse region.<br><br>this talk about "who was here first" is all nationalist nonsense.<br><br>in fact, islam obscures the FACT that there IS a distinct south east asian culture BEFORE its coming.<br><br>bearing in mind that our current boundaries are based on COLONIAL boundaries, it is actually quite bizarre to write a "national history" based on that...<br><br>sigh... politicians are lousy historians...<br></div>
