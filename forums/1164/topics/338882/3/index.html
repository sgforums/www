              <p>fortitude eh ? hmm, i guess thats why the new Mindef commercial tries to compensate for that.</p>
              <p>remember : our soldiers will always have, " THE STEEL WITHIN" ( can tahan no need shit for days, have the steel to hold it all back)</p>
              <p>seriouslly, i dont mind getting sweaty, dirty, dont change underwear and clothes for a week outfield. but shitting is a major nono.</p>
              <p>hygiene issues.</p>
              <p>plus i tihnk its more of a matter of personal preference rather than all around SAF. i dont like to shit outfield simply because i cant squat properly. plus i never had the habit of going to toilet every 2 days anyway. i usually go something like twice a week.</p>
              <p>plus outfield, eat less = shit less. drink less water = shit less.</p>
