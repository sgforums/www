            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by gary1910:</div><div class="quote_body">I dun really remember  which airline, I think maybe Garuda, not very sure, back from HK, but I distinctly remember that the pilot warned us abt taking aerial photo from the plane as we approached Changi, since you r working aviation industry , maybe you could ask abt such rule, the date is abt Nov 2002.<br><br>Then last year , on the Emirates airline, during every landing &amp; takeoff, all windows must be closed, just like with the seat belt. That was the first time I encountered such practice.</div></blockquote>My role is mainly to do with MRO, have very little contact with the Flight Ops side. But I do have a few contacts over in Flight Ops, maybe I can ask them about the shades rule. Although from experience, the crew often remind the pax to keep the shades up not down, maybe its to do with different SOPs of different airlines.<br><br>Meanwhile cavsg has already been kind enough to post on the rules on taking inflight photos.</div>
