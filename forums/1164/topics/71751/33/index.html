            <div class='col-md body'>Actually, F15T is a new version of the infamous Strike Eagle. The bomb carrying capacity alone is almost unrival until now, 1 F15 can delivered maybe around 3-4 Skyhawk bomb load with far more deadly accuracy under all weather conditions. The true ground attack capability of F15E is well demostrated in the modern battlefields, eg Bosnia, Gulf wars etc. It really delivered the punch to the critical enemies installation at the right time with highest precision irregardless of the AA defences.<br><br>It is a quantum leap in our strike capability, and extended our punch to a further reach. Despite that F15 is an old palne, there is still a good 20 years of service life ahead. Already USAF is not going to get the YF22 / BF-23 planes in large numbers. Most likely, F15 will go along with these new gen planes with extensive modifications eg technologies havest in F15 ACTIVE and F15 stealth demostrator.<br><br>My only complaint is that F15 price may be a bit steep for us. We are certain that RSAF would not afford more than 20 F15T in our inventory. Unless we get free gifts / steep discounts eg warehouse prices from USA for helping them to keep the F15 production line open after 2009. Chosing F15T will strengthen the US-S'pore relationship, and enhance our business relation with states as well. By the way, F15 are OLNY offered to the closest US allies. Currently, only a handful of countries are offered; British (tried but rejected in favour of Tornado F3), Japan (213 planes), Isreal (200+ planes), Saudi (80-120 planes), Korea (40 planes) and Singapore (16-20 planes, 1 sqn will be 8 opeartional planes with 2 spares).<br><br>I think the next plane to be replace will be our famous Matchbox Fighter F5E-Tiger II.<br></div>

(the UN secretary general then was a former austrian president suspected of war crimes in WWII !) ..... we allowed them an embassy here, and i think we have been pretty loyal friends to them ....<br><br></div>
