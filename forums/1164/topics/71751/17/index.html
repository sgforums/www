We do this so we can, if we need to, upgrade the hardware. Suppliers can achieve an important competitive advantage if they understand this requirement well.'</strong><br><br>Citing the ongoing evaluations to find a replacement fighter for the A-4 Super Skyhawk, he said the new warplanes might need to work with unmanned vehicles in future and <strong>DSTA also needed to understand how the fighter worked if it were to be upgraded.</strong><br><br>Warplanes being evaluated in the deal, estimated to be worth $2 billion, are Dassault Aviation's Rafale, the Boeing F-15T Strike Eagle and the Eurofighter Typhoon.<br><br>While contractors would not want to give away all their trade secrets, Mr Soh said <strong>'at the minimum' they should ensure DSTA can 'upgrade, modify and integrate' the warplanes at reasonable cost.</strong><br><br>Another key concern was maintenance costs. As much as 40 per cent of the acquisition cost goes to supporting the aircraft through its 20- to 30-year life cycle.<br><br>'We need to buy spares, maintenance and support equipment, and so on. And for readiness reasons, we buy much of these upfront... This is too costly,' he said.<br><br>He suggested that the three warplane makers think up an 'investment strategy' for maintenance to minimise the upfront expenditure.[/b]</blockquote> right ,mr viper  only the rafale fit into our demands , they have offer us to invest in the mk2, n rbe2  radar,n tech transfer, good for  st-engg i think,and whats more the french goverment is supporting this deal,singapore n france have been met so offen to discuss military coperation issue,so rafale stand the biggest chance here,it will be rafale ,it will be rafale. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"></div>
