At low altitude, an AASM still has 15km of range (it is rocket-propelled) and a SCALP-EG still has some range too.<br><br>If your oponent still has an active air force, you will have to go low to bomb your targets unless your strategy is first to anihilate the oponent's airforce. Of course the US will always do that but not all airforces have what it takes to do it.

In my opinion, the F-15E is the most battle-proven among the three but in the competition, other aspects are considered as well, I'm sure somewhere in the thread they explain it but for me, its the Rafale which is the most technologically advanced, though some may disagree...<br><br>p.s. for quite a while, i was rooting for the F-15E...<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>very interesting discussion u guys got there, viper and viking.<br><br>i'd like to point out tho that low-flying capabilities are pretty much similar between the three NGF contenders...<br>it is actually very possible to do low on-the-deck flying w/o TFR. the pilot just has to be much more alert and fly with the aid of FLIR input into the HUD or NVGs to help him distinguish ground from sky.<br>this of course means the pilot has his hands full just flying, and needs a WSO to do everything else, like weapons targeting-- but our interdictor craft will be 2-seaters anyway.<br><br>the APG-63(V)3, RBE2 and (most likely) CAPTOR will have TFR modes anyway, so whether the targeting pod includes one is more or less irrelevant. the first two especially will be able to interleave TFR with GMTI/SAR/targeting/whatever, making the podded TFR even less useful.<br><br>IMO when going against a reasonably modern AD system like malaysia's going low is still the much safer option.</div>

Malaysia air defence does posses the very latest JERNAS (Rapier), thus it posses a significant threat to low flying aircrafts.<br><br>We did discuss about the using UCAV for close support or low level missions. The best thing in the near future for RSAF is to work towards UCAV for more dangerous mission like these. The scale up version of MAV-1 would be a prime candidate that can carry good sensors and small diameter precision bombs.  Second options might be to convert the fleet of A4s to UCAV/drones. Wouldn't be bad to have some QA-4SU flying in front of the VIpers to attract SAMs, with the SEAD Vipers mopping up SAM radars and command and control systems.</div>

It might be a pointer that the RoKAF evaluation on a purely military standpoint found the Rafale as the better aircraft, but after politics was factored in, the F-15 won out.<br><br>Either way, I'm not writing the Typhoon out, although if the news is true, its a definite setback.</div>

A lot of parameters here... hard to tell but what is sure is that there are always some holes for low-level flying aircrafts if you don't have a couple of E-3. Hell, even countries with E-3 like France or UK, which also happen to have a very dense and multi-layered SAM system (Rapier and Crotale NG) feel the need to purchase decicated gap-fillers like Ericsson GIRAFFE (Which I think Singapore also acquired).<br><br>Cheers,</div>

Phased array like Phalcon and Wedgetails do not have this problem. Anyway, air defense system is foolproof, as evidence in the most recent Iraq war where the Patriot couldn't tell friends from foe and planes from missiles.<br><br>BTW, there are many version of the GIRAFFE. I think the one used by the Air Defense guys are bought in the 80s. The 90s version are a lot more advanced and have better detection range. Furthermore, I think SADA also has the P-STAR which I presume is used in conjunction with the various Manpads like Igla and Mistral.<br><br>Back to the NGF issue....<br><br>looks like we all concur that Rafale might have a technical edge over the Eagles. Now, will see if technical edge will prevail over political decision.... (just like I reckon the ADF should have gotten Leo2A6 instead of M1A1)<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>just visualise - u're watching a fighter screaming at 0.8 mach 50m from the ground go right past you. ZOOM! u turn ur head and its gone. same goes for the JERNAS battery - it has precious few seconds with the incoming fighter in its field of view. very very difficult to get a lockon at all.<br><br>but as viper says, why not stay out of range of the SHORADS altogether by just flying high?<br><br>anyway to get back to the topic... i noticed sth. we're looking for a Next Generation Fighter. but the F-15 first flew in 1972, 2 years before the F-16 which flew in 1974. in that sense F-15's a Present or even Previous Generation Fighter! older even than the F-16.<br><br>of course we know that F-15T will have new engines, avionics, weapons and all, and is still superior to the Eurocanards in terms of load-carrying ability and range. but still an old design...<br></div>
