            <div class='col-md body'>Eurofighter Project May Wind Down, Imperiling Thousands of Jobs<br>July 18 (Bloomberg) -- Eurofighter GmbH, the venture in charge of Europe's biggest defense project, may start to wind down production, threatening thousands of jobs, unless the U.K. and other countries buy a second group of 236 planes this month.<br><br>``A binding commitment for funding'' by the end of July is ``the minimum we need followed by an undertaking that contract signature will follow,'' said Eurofighter Chief Executive Officer Aloysius Rauen, 47, in an interview. ``The Eurofighter partner companies are preparing steps to run down the program.''<br><br>The U.K., Germany, Italy and Spain have pledged to buy 620 planes in three batches from Munich-based Eurofighter GmbH. The combat plane, conceived 20 years ago for air defense against Soviet MiGs, is built by BAE Systems Plc, European Aeronautic, Defense &amp; Space Co. and Finmeccanica SpA's Alenia unit.<br><br>Eurofighter is at least six years behind schedule already and the cost has tripled to more than 83 billion euros ($103 billion). The program employs about 10,000 people working on the airframe and another 10,000 working on the engine and other equipment.<br><br>``You've got the cost of shutting down production lines and then of starting them up again,'' Richard Aboulafia, an aerospace industry analyst with the Teal Group in Fairfax, Virginia. ``It's not just jobs at the four main companies, but across the program's very many subcontractors.''<br><br>The U.K. wants to cut the price of the fighter and add the capability to attack ground targets with precision weapons to the planes earlier than planned, according to British government documents seen by Bloomberg News. The U.K.'s demands are under negotiation, Rauen said.<br><br>U.K. Position<br><br>``The U.K. is not yet where the other countries are'' on funding, said Rauen, who declined to give details. ``Hour-by-hour negotiations are ongoing'' to get a commitment. Britain has said it will purchase 89 second-batch aircraft. Germany this month granted approval to buy 68 further planes.<br><br>``The U.K. remains committed to tranche 2 and negotiations are ongoing,'' said Steve Bethel, a spokesman for Britain's Ministry of Defence. Talks between the four nations are ``commercially sensitive,'' he said., declining further comment.<br><br>Britain is the primary obstacle to an agreement to pay for the planes, said EADS Co-Chief Executive Rainer Hertrich, 54, and Thomas Enders, 45, head of EADS's military unit, speaking before the tomorrow's start of the Farnborough Air Show in England.<br><br>``Hurry up in the U.K.!'' said Hertrich in an interview yesterday in Bath, England. ``If we don't have an agreement by the end of July, it will start having consequences immediately'' with employees at EADS and subcontractors being asked to work part-time or even lose jobs, he said. ``Who pays the bill?''<br><br>14,000 Jobs<br><br>As many as 14,000, or 70 percent of the Eurofighter workforce, might be lost by November 2005 and 1.5 billion euros added cost because of delays in signing contract for the second group of planes, according to a Nov. 3 letter, seen by Bloomberg News, from Ernst Dintner, deputy general manager of NETMA, the agency managing the four-nation project.<br><br>Spokesmen for the defense ministries of Germany, Italy and Spain did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Rauen, Hertrich and Enders did not comment on the exact number of jobs that would be affected. EADS employs 6,000 people on Eurofighter.<br><br>``We face the serious threat that we could have a gap here, a disruption of the program which could be very costly,'' said Enders. ``We estimate that could run to between 1 billion and 2 billion euros.''<br><br>The companies will have to start talks with unions to reduce shifts and redeploy workers because of a lack of work if the governments do not commit to the second batch of 236 planes, Rauen said in the interview in his Munich office on Thursday.<br><br>First Tranche<br><br>The four nations agreed to buy 148 planes in a first batch designed for air supremacy. Of that total, 36 have been delivered, 104 are under construction and work remains to begin on eight. Final delivery of the last plane in the batch is set for early 2007. Delivery of the first planes in the second batch is scheduled for the same year, dependent on work beginning soon.<br><br>``The four Eurofighter governments had some time ago agreed that by end of July, latest, they wanted to have a tranche 2 contract signed with industry in order to avoid our coming into a production interruption,'' said Enders.<br><br>``We have already slowed the manufacture'' of the first-batch planes ``to the maximum'' to prevent a costly gap in production, Rauen said. A gap will hurt smaller suppliers more because of their ``limited flexibility'' to ``take workers out of the production process.''<br><br>Representatives from the contractors, NETMA and the four governments will meet this week during the air show to discuss the state of the program.<br><br>Ground Targets<br><br>The U.K. would like the next batch of planes to have the ability to attack ground targets with precision ordnance including laser-guided bombs, such as Stormshadow and Brimstone missiles, government documents show. In the Iraq and Afghanistan wars, there was little need for air-defense aircraft.<br><br>BAE in April said it plans to cut 1,000 jobs between now and 2005 at plants making Eurofighter and Nimrod planes as the air- systems division reorganizes to handle less work. BAE Chief Executive Mike Turner said in February a production contract for the second-batch planes may be delayed until the end of 2004.<br><br>Eurofighter reduced the cost of the second batch of planes by 200 million euros and agreed to sell 18 aircraft earmarked for the U.K. to Austria, easing Britain's defense budget, Hertrich said in April. The U.K. will take delivery of an equal amount at a later date, he said.<br><br>``Three parties have largely done their homework, one party hasn't,'' said Enders. ``That is posing a problem.''<br><br>From Bloomberg<br><br></div>
