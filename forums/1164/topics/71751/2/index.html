            <div class='col-md body'>kingkhong79 and Fairyland, I agree with you point that if the NGF is to be looked at purely from the standpoint of a stopgap fighter to keep our edge in a regional sense until the F-35 is ready, then an F-15 would make more sense than the other 2 contenders. But think about it, are things really that simple?<br><br>Lets start with things that are going on right now. We have been blindsided by the Yanks on tech transfer issues on many many angles. The point is, Singapore doesn't want to be purely an "end-user" of the military equipment it buys. We want to be able to upgrade it, integrate more weapons on it, other gizmos on it, allow it to operate more seamlessly with the other pieces of hardware in the inventory. How are we going to do that when the Yanks hold us to ransom to that all the time, and more often than not, is subject to the vagaries of whos in the White House. Is that what you want?<br><br>Then, lets go crystal ball gazing and look into the future. The F-35 program has its share of problems. Even if it arrives on schedule in 2012, when can we get our first ones? 2015? 2020? 2025? Ever? There is already increasing rumblings that to see the F-35 program through, someone other than the Americans are going to have to stump up the cash. The Yanks have the F-22 and a whole bunch of other projects and by their own admissions, the F-35, while not on the backburner, is not a top priority for defense funds. When a program demands more and more money that simply isn't available, only one thing can happen. If the unhinkable happens and the F-35 is cancelled, we'll be stuck with 2 1970s design to hold the fort. At 2020, our oldest C/D Vipers will be more than 25 years old.  A saying about a dead horse springs to my mind.<br><br>That is not to say getting the 2 Euro-canards don't have their own downsides. I'm just not advocating blindly going "Go Yankees" here. Look at the big picture.<br></div>

Simulations are just that, simulations. Before jumping to conclusions about how good it is, I'd like to know the parameters of the simulation BAe carried out to get its results. Relative positions of both planes to each other, range, weapons and stores loadouts, availablity of AEWACs etc. Lets try a simplistic example, if a simulation stick a lightly loaded F-5 armed with 2 Sidewinders 3 miles behind a fully loaded Typhoon at its 6 o'clock and start the simulation, can one then claim that simulation tests, the F-5s always beat the Typhoon in WVR and hence is a better fighter?<br><br>As for the Russian wonderweapon R-77, the PLAAF concluded it was a overrated piece of crap at its max range, while the RoCAF found their MICAs worked as advertised at its max <strong>lethal</strong> range<br><br>Until then, I'll keep an open mind about the Typhoon being the <span style="font-style: italic;">wunder</span> aircraft that BAe says it is.</div>

But think about it, are things really that simple?<br><br>Lets start with things that are going on right now. We have been blindsided by the Yanks on tech transfer issues on many many angles. The point is, Singapore doesn't want to be purely an "end-user" of the military equipment it buys. We want to be able to upgrade it, integrate more weapons on it, other gizmos on it, allow it to operate more seamlessly with the other pieces of hardware in the inventory. How are we going to do that when the Yanks hold us to ransom to that all the time, and more often than not, is subject to the vagaries of whos in the White House. Is that what you want?<br><br>Then, lets go crystal ball gazing and look into the future. The F-35 program has its share of problems. Even if it arrives on schedule in 2012, when can we get our first ones? 2015? 2020? 2025? Ever? There is already increasing rumblings that to see the F-35 program through, someone other than the Americans are going to have to stump up the cash. The Yanks have the F-22 and a whole bunch of other projects and by their own admissions, the F-35, while not on the backburner, is not a top priority for defense funds. When a program demands more and more money that simply isn't available, only one thing can happen. If the unhinkable happens and the F-35 is cancelled, we'll be stuck with 2 1970s design to hold the fort. At 2020, our oldest C/D Vipers will be more than 25 years old.  A saying about a dead horse springs to my mind.<br><br>That is not to say getting the 2 Euro-canards don't have their own downsides. I'm just not advocating blindly going "Go Yankees" here. Look at the big picture.<br></div></blockquote>The F15 is not really a stop gap solution until the F35 arrives.its simply a replacement for the A4.in this regard i would say this Next generation FIGHTER is a misnomer because most probably its going to be used as an ground attack aircraft rather than for air-to-air combat.theres a high chance of the F35 failing to meet its expections,its really a design with too many compromises,a design tat aims to satisfy everybody but ends up satisfying none.i would put my bet on our next air-superiority fighter to be the F22.<br><br>True singapore wants to be able to upgrade its weapons but in this case the french did not promise any tangible tech transfer.it simply says we can play a part in the development of the advanced radar system they r working on,so even if there is any real tech transfer,we can only upgrade the radar system.so wats the point.[/b]</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>F-15E may be the "undisputed" air superiority fighter for the past decade, but it certainly wouldn't be for the next decade. And as much as the americans say that it has a proven kill record, the F-15 hasn't proven itself in combat against any NGF either. Also, the americans are promoting the export version of the F-15E/F to us, and from past history, that probably means degraded avionics/systems as well....<br>Since RSAF has always upgraded or modified our a/c to suit our needs/tactics/environment, my opinion is that it is best suited to choose the Eurofighter or Rafale. Transfer of technology would be a real sweetener in this case. Sure these a/c may have their teething problems, and they have not proven itself in combat, but they will certainly meet the needs of the Air Force till the JSF arrives (if and when) to replace the F-16.<br>My vote goes to the Eurofighter, since it is more cost effective compared to Rafale, and has better growth potential for future operational capabilities.</div>

And did the yanks offered us any tech transfer when we bought the F16?Did the lack of tech transfer affect the effectiveness of the F16 in the RSAF in any way?Did we need any tech transfer of the F16 in order to integrate it into our defence system?Did we need the souce code of the F16 for weapons integration with other sources?The answer to all this is a definite no.  yeah the tech transfer will be a nice-to-have but not very crucial in our case.we simply need a capable tried-and-tested battle-proven cost-effective fighter/attack aircraft NOW.The keyword is NOW.That will be the F15 no doubt about tat.The Typhoon and rafale is still undergoing testing and orders to the french and German airforces may not be fulfilled for a number of years yet.this is especially true for the Typhoon.so when will the RSAF get its first aircraft delivery if it chooses the rafale or typhoon?The typhoon and rafale represents the future MAYBE. but the F15 is NOW.<br>tats why the RSAF will choose the F15.The Rafale and typhoon are simply the pawns of the RSAF to get a better deal from the yanks.<br><br>regarding your last question,My definiton of tech transfer is the same as your.but to mi tech transfer is a pretty vague term because there is always the extent and depth of tech transfer to be considered.providing the source code in my opinion is not very deep or extensive.in any way,i think the only reason the french and british r willing to provide source codes to us is because the rafale and typhoon need lots of troubleshooting in terms of systems integration,sure will help their aircraft industry if singapore can contribute to the troubleshooting exercise of their troubleprone national aircraft.Mindef will have no need for the source code of the F15 because its systems are fully integrated and tested already.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>my opinions are that the biggest concern rite now for rsaf is how the new fighter can deal with the flanker threat around us, nearby we got malaysians and indonesians operating it. further up we have india, vietnam and china. the whole place is full of them.  if the recent exercises between f-15c and su-30k is true, the f-15 is at a disadvantage over the flanker.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I don't buy the "We need fighter NOW" arguement.<br><br>Even if we place the order NOW, it will be years before the RSAF can introduce a new figther type into service. There will be training, detailed contract negotiation and system integration, testing testing and more testing....and then more training..... So we won't be seeing another new figther until many years from now.<br><br>By which time the Raf and Typ would have matured. The Typhoon would have been in full service with its many operaters. For Raf it will be in service for quite sometime and might even find some export customers. I am not gunning for the Raf and Typ but I think we should look at the most suitable figther many years later when the figther is in service and for the many many years later of service with its upgrade and so on.<br><br>When we look forward into the future, the F15 become less suitable. Why do I say that?<br><br>I am not trying to shoot the F15 down. So far no F15 was ever lost in air-to-air combat. I still think that it is the most "natural" progression for the RSAF. It is in use by the USAF which is our pseudo ally and the IAF which are our "dear" friend in terms of upgrade solutions. Also the Korean Air force went for the F15 so is is definitely the front runner in this race. If we are thinking of a "low risk" system integration solution, F15 is the key.<br><br>But it cannot disputed that this plane first see service in the 1970s and was originally designed to combat the Mig 25 Foxbat!!! and was replacing the F4 Phantom. Its future potential is really in doubt.<br><br>And I don't think the RSAF is in urgent need of a new a/c type NOW. If we take the F16 based in the US and the local based fighter into a fight, we could probably outgun almost all the rest of SEA put together right now! In both numbers and technology.<br><br>The F18E and new gen Sukois will need time to be operational. And there will not be enough of them to make a significant differnence.<br><br>Look ahead, don't be too short-sighted.<br></div>

But I thought the French has imparted to us their Masters radar technology and then we went onto the Herakles.......<br><br>Singapore given an inherently stable airframe has the expertise to upgrade most of the black boxes. I hazard to say that we may even try to alter it's flight characteristics too. Eg Yaw damper, strakes here and there....etc<br><br>All in all I'd say we have proven capabilities in this area. Tech transfer for NGFs should not be an overiding factor in the deal......I'm sure there are other ways to get there.<br><br>As for the US President......I thought our relationship with them is multi-faceted. I think we are closer to the Pentagon than the White House or Congress. Change of Presidency will not have that great an impact......not as good as the Israeli lobby but not that bad.<br><br>In this area, I think Singapore Foreign Ministry has neglected the most powerful lobby in US -&gt; <strong>Free Sex for ALL</strong>.

            <div class='col-md body'>This discussion is getting too interesting for me to sideline and I will add my 2 cents worth... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>I see the arguments of both pro and against an F15 selection, personally, I am against RSAF getting the F15. The argument against F15 stack up much higher than the pro F15 argument and I will not be surprised if DSTA finds that so.<br><br>The biggest disincentive for F15 is its growth protential and technology transfer which in my eyes is probably one of the highest critial for a successful bid. The reason is simple. Singapore is no longer just a pure consumer of high tech equipment, in this case, fighter jets. It wants to be able to upgrade it, modify it, change it as it see fits and necessary.  Singapore needs to be able to integrate weapons from non tradition source (namely from Israel and who knows where else). If we examin carefully the procurement habits by DSTA/Mindef, we can easily spot the trend where Singapore now relies lesser and lesser from the USA, but now shift to other European countries and Israel (Israel is becoming a more important source of high tech stuff than the USA!!!).<br><br>Look, if history teaches us anything, it taught us that there are no purchase of high end weapons or platforms from the USA without some sort of condition attached. kingkhong79 cited two examples of which Singapore seemingly got high-end stuff without strings attached, and I can counter argue that. The purchase of KC-135 was not some high end stuff. The KC-135s were effectively stored in the desert for disposal. RSAF cleverly got the frames, upgrade them to the latest -R version and got a greatest bang for the buck. Good bye, but hardly high end/high tech stuff. Given KC-135 were needed to reful the Vipers (the only way since Vipers do not take from drogue refuelling).<br><br>As for the Apache purchase, oh, interesting one. RSAF had always wanted Apaches, but the US won't release them and when they do, they won't give Singapore the Longbow radar. Singapore threaten to buy Eurocopter Tiger and that was when an attitude change occurred. Man, I reckon Singapore would have been better off getting Super Cobras or even Tigers.<br><br>So what does this have to do with the F-15 selection one might ask.<br>Well, here are my reasonings:<br><br>1. F-15, although fully integrated, uses technologies developed in the mid to late eighties. Singapore F-15T version will no doubt be slightly less capable than the USAF F-15E. Avionics suite might differ. There are no firm guarantee that Singapore will get the AESA radar too although this has been floated as an option.<br><br>2. No source code to modify the Eagles. Unless we start adopting Israeli F-15I avionics and relies on Israel to provide us with source code and their technology, I can't see us getting any technological advancement from this purchase. Even when the Israeli purchased their F-15I, they were restricted to field US made radar and mission computers. US forbidded them to replace APG-70 radar even when Israel claimed to have developed a radar with a better SAR resolution.<br><br>3. Growth potential fast diminishing. USAF now concentrates on the Raptors program. Why would they upgrade or grow the Eagles more. I can't see ST Aero being too successful in growing the Eagles without significant price to pay, either to the Israeli or Boeing. Boeing is going to be the biggest winner here, not Singapore.<br><br>4. The argument about XXX weapons integration with F-15 is very moot. If we can't even get approval to purchase the XXX weapons, why do you think the integration matters. Our Vipers are already so integrated with all different weapons including Slammer-ER and HARM. Why do you think we haven't seen them on our Vipers first.

Why would they refuse to sell weapons to us? Which deals scuppered? Heres a short list, I'm sure theres more:<br><br>1970s: In flight refueling capabilty. We wanted it, approached the Yanks. They said no. In the end we had to get Bedek Aviation, a subsidiary of IAI to convert a couple of Herks for the RSAF<br><br>1990s. AMRAAMs. A almost decade long wait for them, on the flimsy pretext that the US will not introduce new class of weapons in E Asia, until the PLAAF got their R-77s. And even then, we had to keep the AMRAAMS on Guam till the PLAAF test fired their R-77s.<br><br>1990s again. Link 16 tactical datalink. We wanted it, US Navy wanted us to have it. Politicians said no as Singapore wanted tech transfer of source codes to integrate it on other platforms. USN finally won out on the sale, but politicians still wanted to attach strings on tech transfer on the Link 16. In the end, we pulled out and went for an Israeli datalink.<br><br>Another little titbit. We've always been using, and are still using 2nd rate Sidewinder AAMs compared to other allies, even in this region. Still think your Yankee friends will sell Singapore F-22s?<br><br>snip<br></div></blockquote>You left out INS for the A-4 upgrade.  The US govt refuse to sell us laser ring gyros.  In the end ST went for a Litton LRG.<br><br>There is also the F-5 upgrade IIRC the radar is Italian.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by Joe Black:</div><div class="quote_body">This discussion is getting too interesting for me to sideline and I will add my 2 cents worth... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>I see the arguments of both pro and against an F15 selection, personally, I am against RSAF getting the F15. The argument against F15 stack up much higher than the pro F15 argument and I will not be surprised if DSTA finds that so.<br><br>The biggest disincentive for F15 is its growth protential and technology transfer which in my eyes is probably one of the highest critial for a successful bid. The reason is simple. Singapore is no longer just a pure consumer of high tech equipment, in this case, fighter jets. It wants to be able to upgrade it, modify it, change it as it see fits and necessary.  Singapore needs to be able to integrate weapons from non tradition source (namely from Israel and who knows where else). If we examin carefully the procurement habits by DSTA/Mindef, we can easily spot the trend where Singapore now relies lesser and lesser from the USA, but now shift to other European countries and Israel (Israel is becoming a more important source of high tech stuff than the USA!!!).<br><br>Look, if history teaches us anything, it taught us that there are no purchase of high end weapons or platforms from the USA without some sort of condition attached. kingkhong79 cited two examples of which Singapore seemingly got high-end stuff without strings attached, and I can counter argue that. The purchase of KC-135 was not some high end stuff. The KC-135s were effectively stored in the desert for disposal. RSAF cleverly got the frames, upgrade them to the latest -R version and got a greatest bang for the buck. Good bye, but hardly high end/high tech stuff. Given KC-135 were needed to reful the Vipers (the only way since Vipers do not take from drogue refuelling).<br><br>As for the Apache purchase, oh, interesting one. RSAF had always wanted Apaches, but the US won't release them and when they do, they won't give Singapore the Longbow radar. Singapore threaten to buy Eurocopter Tiger and that was when an attitude change occurred. Man, I reckon Singapore would have been better off getting Super Cobras or even Tigers.<br><br>So what does this have to do with the F-15 selection one might ask.<br>Well, here are my reasonings:<br><br>1. F-15, although fully integrated, uses technologies developed in the mid to late eighties. Singapore F-15T version will no doubt be slightly less capable than the USAF F-15E. Avionics suite might differ. There are no firm guarantee that Singapore will get the AESA radar too although this has been floated as an option.<br><br>2. No source code to modify the Eagles. Unless we start adopting Israeli F-15I avionics and relies on Israel to provide us with source code and their technology, I can't see us getting any technological advancement from this purchase. Even when the Israeli purchased their F-15I, they were restricted to field US made radar and mission computers. US forbidded them to replace APG-70 radar even when Israel claimed to have developed a radar with a better SAR resolution.<br><br>3. Growth potential fast diminishing. USAF now concentrates on the Raptors program. Why would they upgrade or grow the Eagles more. I can't see ST Aero being too successful in growing the Eagles without significant price to pay, either to the Israeli or Boeing. Boeing is going to be the biggest winner here, not Singapore.<br><br>4. The argument about XXX weapons integration with F-15 is very moot. If we can't even get approval to purchase the XXX weapons, why do you think the integration matters. Our Vipers are already so integrated with all different weapons including Slammer-ER and HARM. Why do you think we haven't seen them on our Vipers first. The Euro-carnards win on this point big time!<br><br>There are so many counter arguments for a F-15 selection that it is not even funny.<br><br>BTW, F15 lights up the radar like a Christmas tree. Its RCS is shocking bad. Rafale wins here in terms of stealth. Rafale's RCS is reportedly better than Super bugs. So go figure. If the argument is that the NGF is going to be used for deep strike interdiction, which one would you choose? Rafale will also win in a silence mode BVR engagement given its relatively low RCS and its ability to use its optronic IR tracker to detect enemy fighters rather revealing itself by its radar emission. Eagles does not have the capability unless US release the SniperXR to Singapore and its another extra pod to sling on its underbelly. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>So much for now....<br><br></div></blockquote>i agree tat tech transfer will be important if we to be able to upgrade our planes.but do u think we really need to upgrade the plane ourselves if we buy the F15.the israelis and americans will have a lot of upgrade packages developed for the F15.the F15 will remain in service withe USAF for a long time yet because it will be at least another decade before the F22 enters into mass production.on the other hand if we buy the rafale we'll be dependent entirely on the french for upgrades and spares and troubleshooting,wwho knows wat the potential problems wif the rafale are because its not fully tested.<br>As my argument goes,the risk with choosing the F15 is zero.the risk with choosing the rafale or typhoon is huge.like i said before,the Mindef want immediate delivery of their purchase and not apurchase that can be delivered only ten years down the road.tats the reason why the mindef is evaluating the aircrafts NOW because it wants a attack/fighter aircraft NOW.In this case,the Typhoon was never a contender in the first place.The rafale is being used as apawn to get a better deal from the americans juz like the case in the past when we threatened to get the Tiger chopper when the yanks refused to sell their Longbow Apache to us.</div>
