            <div class='col-md body'>I'm not saying that you cannot post your opinions.  I want to correct those opinions that are wrong.  I don't anyone who reads here going away with wrong thinking.  I remember a quote that I've lost it, it says the excitement and anticipation of flying is up to the first flight. Your thinking about flying changes after your first lesson.  Which is very true. The perspective from a pilot and non pilot is totally different and its more dangerous if that perspective is not corrected when the non pilot becomes a pilot.  I don't want anyone to think that since fighter/commercial pilots fly sims before they fly actual a/c, s/he can install a sim on a pc, practise till perfect and go for the first flight and think s/he can take off, climb, straight n level, glide and land. It doesn't work this way.  In fact its very dangerous, because all these time there is no instructor to check for mistakes and worse those bad habits are bought into the cockpit. To be honest, I was stupid enough when young to mess around with those pc sims thinking they do the same job as commercial ones, and when I started my flying lessons. I could not fly straight and level without looking at the artificial horizon when I suppose to look out of the cockpit to judge myself. I could not kick off this bad habit for a long time.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Haha! I know what u mean   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy">  I did the same thing as well, before going for my PPL a long time ago, playing Flight Sim on the computer thinking it helps, but ended up looking more at the instruments rather than visual horizon!<br>However, Simulators (not referring to the computer games ones) will always be a good complement in flying advanced aircraft types, esp in the military. The requirement to perform procedures or manoeuvres correctly is essential, and Simulators can be a good source of practice, especially for areas such as aircraft emergencies. And with the purchase of the NGF, I'm sure that RSAF will also require the use of Simulator facilities for that NGF as well.</div>

They concluded that the problems are so bad that the plane should not be used for complex manoeuvres, such as those in aerial combat, and should not fly in cloud without a second, experienced, pilot on board.<br><br>Not a good finding for a plane whose slogan is: "Eurofighter Typhoon. Nothing stands in its way!"<br><br>The Eurofighter is designed to be intentionally aerodynamically unstable. This makes it more agile, particularly at supersonic speeds; reduces drag; and gives it an overall increase in lift. However, this also means it can't be flown without the computerised Flight Control System.<br><br>Rather unfortunate, then, that report reveals "corruption" of the<br>computers could make it switch from flight mode to ground mode, while the plane is flying. The report says "It is recommended as essential that the cause of this fault are investigated, understood and if necessary rectified".<br><br>"It is not surprising this report found safety concerns," a<br>spokeswoman for the MOD told El Reg. "That is exactly what we commissioned it for. Gilligan has got the wrong end of the stick."<br><br>There is no way, the MOD says, it would release a plane for service if there were still concerns over its safety, and maintains it has dealt with all the problems identified in the report. "Safety is paramount", the spokeswoman added.<br><br>However, Gilligan cites RAF sources saying that while some of the recommendations raised by Qinetiq had been accepted, others, such as the limitation on flying in cloud, had not.<br><br>QinetiQ, the company which produced the report, said that the testing and development was an ongoing process.<br><br>The plane has been given an initial release, and the MOD has taken delivery of six aircraft which will be used for training purposes. These will be two seater planes, with the back seat being for the instrutor. The final version will be a single seater.<br><br>The Eurofighter is 15.9m long, and has a 10.35m wingspan. Its two engines, each capable of generating 20,000lbs of thrust, propel it from the ground to 35,000 feet and mach 1.5 in less than 2.5 minutes.<br><br>The jet, which is nearly four and half years late already, and<br>Â£2.3bn over budget, is expected to make it into full service at RAF Conningsby in June 2006.

            <div class='col-md body'>Typhoon receives formal release to service certificate, freeing the aircraft from restrictive flight limitations<br><br>The Royal Air Force's Eurofighter Typhoon has received its formal release to service (RTS), freeing the UK's first Tranche 1, Batch 1 production aircraft from restrictive flight limitations imposed late last year under its Case White introduction to service programme with BAE Systems.<br><br>Signed on 13 May, the RTS document clears the aircraft for service instructor pilot training, operational test and evaluation and operational conversion unit syllabus validation activities.<br><br>An RTS recommendations report was presented on 30 April by the UK's QinetiQ test and evaluation agency which had been contracted to conduct an eight-month assessment of the Typhoon's operational readiness.<br><br>The aircraft was initially operated under temporary restrictions that combined airworthiness flight limitations identified by the four-nation Eurofighter consortium with additional limits imposed by the UK Defence Procurement Agency's Typhoon Integrated Project Team (IPT).<br><br>According to Ministry of Defence sources, the QinetiQ report identified three areas of concern which could have halted the release of RTS approval, although two of those could be adequately mitigated by imposing operational limitations.<br><br>QinetiQ found the aircraft's low-speed warning system was ineffective when used with the manual low-speed recovery procedure, while <strong>head-up display limitations made it difficult for pilots to manage the aircraft's energy state during dynamic manoeuvres.</strong><br><br>The agency believed these flaws  could lead to the aircraft decelerating to a speed at which its flight control software would be unable to stabilise the aircraft, risking an "irrecoverable departure".<br><br>It is also understood to have warned of software bus failures, with the potential loss of all flight reference information, <strong>and to have recommended that two pilots operate the aircraft when in instrument meteorological conditions.</strong><br><br>Another concern centred on the Typhoon's landing gear computer which, it says, has experienced a series of unpredictable failures leading to spurious landing gear indications and a loss of braking.<br><br>Partly as a result of the QinetiQ study, "the Typhoon has been modified, procedures reviewed and limitations put in place", the RAF tells Flight International. No crewing restrictions were imposed in the RAF's final RTS approval and sources close to the Typhoon IPT say the document provides a level of safety unparalleled during earlier fighter acquisitions.<br><br>"The RAF has been operating its Typhoons quite aggressively since December 2003 and there are no restrictions affecting the operational evaluation unit's work," says a BAE source. Nor have the UK's partners in the Eurofighter project - Germany, Italy and Spain - imposed limitations on their aircraft as a result of the UK safety study, the source adds.<br><br>The first Typhoon to fly in the markings of the RAF's 29(R) Squadron operational conversion unit conducted its debut sortie from BAE's Warton manufacturing site on 20 May.</div>
