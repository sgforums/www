I don't trust this plane actually, it is Germany, Italy virgin plane. It is also new and never went on war before.

            <div class='col-md body'>Hi All,<br><br>Sbs guy - it seems fairly likely that the role of the Tigereye will be taken over by our fast-growing and increasingly-important fleet of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) - Singapore is looking into robotic vehicles as serious "force multiplier" units and medium to long term is odds on to delegate all reconnaisance activity to robot planes.<br><br>Regarding your other question, it seems to me that you are asking "why are we considering omni-role fighters to replace the Skyhawk, which is a close air support specialist?".  The modern air forces are currently entering a new phase of replacing large numbers of decent and one-dimensional planes with smaller numbers of very very very capable ones.  Take the RSAF as an example - say we have 60 A4s (close air support) and 60 F5s (air interdiction and interception).  We would be looking to replace them with 60 (rather than 120) Omnirole fighters in which the pilots are expected to fly-fight-bomb-fight-land in this one platform.  It has been a sort of "trend" ever since the F/A-18 and all new plane developments since then have been geared towards this capability.  It makes sense to the smaller armed forces too - replace two types of aircraft with a smaller numer of one type - same capability as before but just as easy, if not easier to service.<br><br>The bottom line is whatever Singapore chooses in the end, we can ber certain that it would be a carefully eveluated and considered decision based on force requirements and not some politician's whim.  It would likely be the "best" - perhaps not the best plane of the lot - but the best for Singapore in the long-term.<br><br>Cheers.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hi sbs,<br><br>Thank you for pointing out that my point appears practical.  It isn't my point, its the upgrading doctrine of most modern air forces in the world today.  You must realise "Omnirole" does not mean "can do only one thing",  it means "can do EVERYTHING" - a point that you may have mistaken.<br><br>It seems that you are extremely worried about the "replacement" of our fleet of "strike" aircraft. What I tried to explain in my previous post is that you do not have anything to worry about with regards to replacing the cute little Skyhawk.  All three of the aircraft under evaluation are not just worthy successors to the A4, BUT will carry a helluva lot more, fly a whole lot further, deliver the payload more precisely and have the means to fly back "hot 'n fighting" much more capably than the A4SU ever will. If you want to talk numbers, the Eurofighter (which by the way I don't fancy anyway) carries a 6500-7500 KILO payload versus the A4's 8200 POUND one (thats roughly 4000 kilos). Strike Eagle can pack 10.5 thousand kilos. Rafale can carry 8 thousand kilos.<br><br>With regard to the "legs" of the Typhoon, open sources state that the full-load combat radius (hi-lo-hi) is 1389 kilometers, well above your 500+ km estimate and not much less than the Strike Eagle's 1463 km rating.  With twin drop tanks, it can go up to 3706 km, again not very much less than the Strike Eagle's radius on tanks.<br><br>Bottom line is - EF isn't neccessarily worse than any of the other two contenders - you just personally don't seem to like it! That's fine though, for a forum.  But we need to be sure of the facts before slagging anything.  Just go to Google and read up more on the planes.  Its great fun and fairly informative. And please don't mark me as a Typhoon fan either - if it were up to me, I'd go for the Rafale in a heartbeat.  But I reckon its good for Singapore that our fighter aircraft purchase decisions are not made by the likes of you or me!<br><br>I hope I have laid your concerns to rest.<br><br>Cheers</div>

EuroFighter can only run abt 2700km, while F15 can run up to 5400km at 1 go.<br><br>Why I say F18 is because of our neighbour purchase, it can inflict a very painful wound.
