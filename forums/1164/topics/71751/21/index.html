Someone would only need a few lesions in MS Flightsim to start, fly and land those birds in the virtual environment.

There are persons out there in WAAF that have been asserting that Rafale's design is superior....<br><br>In that respect, it ain't about a French poodle vs. a British bulldog, but rather which is a well-designed hunting dog.  BTW, MIW website article on Typhoon starts off by comparing it to a horse created by a committee.....i.e., a camel!!!<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"><br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by jwcook:</div><div class="quote_body">The Typhoon is at a disadvantage because its early in its development, the Rafale is ahead in its development, Its much much better to say 'Rafale can do this now' rather than 'Typhoon will do that (better)in six months'.<br><br></div></blockquote>Could not put it better.  From a project risk point of view, the Typhoon is the most risky because it is so early in its development.<br><br>I personally think it is too early to conclude that the Typhoon will be able to do better what the Rafale can do now in six months.  There can be delays due to a host of problems ranging from diffiulties in ironing out the kinks, software problems, etc.  --&gt; growing pains.  Then there is opeval.  where the planes are put through the paces of real flying by oeprational pilots.  This is where the rubber hits the road....<br><br>I sure do hope the evaluators (and I think they will) do a no-bulls assessment of the risk and capabilities of each NGF contenders.  We have had enough of hype (and suffered a lot too) from the IT, and stockmarkets.<br><br>Throw in the political wrangling of the partners of workshare vs, costshare, vs.  cost per plane, etc., change of government which results in a change of priorities (e.g., Germany torpedo-ed the project so as to save money for East-West integration).<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by jwcook:</div><div class="quote_body">The Typhoon has an advantage in the spares and logistics department, there's quite a few novel ways to support your fleet with the Typhoon, having Eurofighter hold some of your spares or only paying for the flight hours are a couple of new concepts.<br><br></div></blockquote>That to me appears to be the main selling point of the Typhoon.  However, I am not sure.  You have different countries working on different parts of the plane.  And I think there is little or no overlap / duplication.  Would a scenario arise where say country X refuses to sell us the landing gear cos' of XYZ reasons?<br><br>I would therefore submit that the permuations of possibe lack of spares are more....i.e., we need to be friends to all.....as opposed to one or two countries.<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by jwcook:</div><div class="quote_body">If Singapore is eventually going to get the JSF,  then the Typhoon is quite a good choice, both the UK and Italy will be operating JSF/Typhoon fleets, they will have paid for the intergration and they must feel that both aircraft fulfill a different need/requirement/role.<br><br></div></blockquote>That is true.  But if we have access to French weapons and technology, and use it to integrate onto our existing fleet, including the JSF.......heh heh heh....<br><br>The French weapons were rather under-estimated I must say....<br><br>The NGF is supposed to last 30-40 years?  Hence, I would think the JSF would intially be pitched to replace the aging F-5s after 2010 (not necessarily one-to-one replacement in terms of the roles though).<br><br>Cheers<br><br></div>
