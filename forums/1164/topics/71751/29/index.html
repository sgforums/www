Rafale was the more popular choice among the local military enthusiasts then for the same reasons as you do now. It seemed more agile, modern and politically-justifiable, taking account of anti-American sentiment among the young people.<br><br>But since then, F-15K has proven itself to be rather a smarter choice due to a currency swing and it is now almost 25 percent cheaper in Korean won than Rafale. In addition, its performance and operational capability promised by Boeing certainly satisfy the ROKAF requirements. They have wanted a big deep-penetration fighter-bomber with air-superiority capability after all, for which Rafale is not. Further, F-15K delivery, logistic build-up and technical transfer are all on schedule. Would the French have provided us the same if the selection was made otherwise? I doubt it because of their internal problems.<br><br>I hope the RSAF would make a final decision on NGF best fit to their requirements anyway.<br>And my one final remark is that the ROKAF has just announced the second batch (40 units) of the future fighter purchase, certainly for F-15K, which will bring the total number of the fighter to 80 in their inventory.<br></div></blockquote>Hmm, seems like my take on the role of the F-15T as a deep strike asset is right after all.Much as the Rafale can perform in mid-air, it doesn't have the ability to deliver more ordnance.<br><br>Oh well, let's hope the RSAF buys accordingly to our needs.It's good to be allies. but we must show that we will not be forced to buy something because of what Bush says.It's our needs that dictate such purchases.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>In my opinion, the RSAF should acquire the Boeing F-15T. Although the F-15 has been in service for more than 20 years, it is still a formidable warplane. It has been proven in combat, claiming 36 of the 39 USAF aerial victories in Operation Desert Storm, without a single loss. The F-15E also made its debut at the same time, and proved outstanding in this and other combat actions. The RSAF has operated US aircraft for many years and there should be little problem in the transition, from the point of view of avionics or logistics. Singapore also has good relations with the US and Israel who have vast experience in operating similar aircraft, the F-15E (Strike Eagle) and the F-15I Ra'am (Thunder). The weapons used are also familiar to the RSAF, (M61A1 Vulcan cannon, Mk 82, Mk 83, AGM-65 Maverick, AIM-9 Sidewinders, AIM-120 AMRAAM's, etc...) It would seem the most logical choice.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>seems like tough choice...<br><br>But I think what RSAF is looking for is really technological transfer and advanced missle such as the storm shadow. The US has been reluctant on passing us the source codes. And remember, we took a lot of effort to acquire the AIM-120s... So having a french fighter would be good as you know, with money, you can buy all the available ordnance. I place my bet on Rafale. But I would also like to see the F-15 in our inventory. It's a superb fighter and no doubt a good force projector. But I think it's really hard to choose. Rafale is also a good force projector and has sleeker design than the F-15. So let's buy both of them(haha).<br><br>Anyway, anyone know how is our AIM-120 compared to the one USAF has. I heard that the US often 'downgrade' certain advanced and sensitive weapon systems for export. Any truth to it?<br>If it's true, I would go for Rafale.</div>

However i believe the F-15 cannot super cruise while the Eurofighter can.</div>
