So how? Cut another hole in the frame and risk structural integrety .... ) and after all the boxes connected you need to do EMI/EMC testing......<br><br>Then you need to put in (more like stick on) all the sensors and data logger to monitor Gs, heat etc for the prototypes ..... where to find the space?<br><br>Hey it's not easy!
