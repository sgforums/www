            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by kingkhong79:</div><div class="quote_body">Thanks for the history but we r now in the year 2004.regarding the inflight refuelling aircraft,we've got the KC135 now from the yanks didnt we?</div></blockquote>Yes, but because the USAF knows perfectly from experience that if we don't get the KC-135s from them, we'll get boom refuelers from someone else. Be it Israel, Iran or anyone else. As they have shown, if they can deny us the capability, they will. At the drop of a hat<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from"></div><div class="quote_body">i recall when we first expressed interest in purchasing the Apache from the yanks,they only wanted to offer us the Apache AH64A without the mastmounted radar system but in the end they still sold us the latest Longbow Apache. </div></blockquote>Thats because we had a VERY good alternative waiting in the Eurocopter Tiger. Even so, I've heard that the Longbow radars might be kept in US territory until a "military threat against Singapore is imminent" (again)<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from"></div><div class="quote_body">And did the yanks offered us any tech transfer when we bought the F16?Did the lack of tech transfer affect the effectiveness of the F16 in the RSAF in any way?Did we need any tech transfer of the F16 in order to integrate it into our defence system?Did we need the souce code of the F16 for weapons integration with other sources?The answer to all this is a definite no.  </div></blockquote>To answer your questions; Yes, but not all we wanted. Yes. Yes. Yes. Your answer (or shall we say, assumption) only shows how much you know about the Peace Carvin program. There are a lot on the C/D Vipers we have that came from the Israelis, who were the ones who gave us the source codes to integrate a whole bunch of goodies onto the aircraft, which I won't go into detail but most of the military nuts here(save for you) already know about.<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from"></div><div class="quote_body">yeah the tech transfer will be a nice-to-have but not very crucial in our case.we simply need a capable tried-and-tested battle-proven cost-effective fighter/attack aircraft NOW.The keyword is NOW.That will be the F15 no doubt about tat.The Typhoon and rafale is still undergoing testing and orders to the french and German airforces may not be fulfilled for a number of years yet. this is especially true for the Typhoon</div></blockquote>Wrong, wrong, partially right and wrong. DSTA already has said tech transfer might make of break this fighter deal. We don't need the new fighter now, the last A-4s are due to go in 2007. Meanwhile F-15 deliveries to RoK start in mid-'06. You sure Boeing St Louis can complete the 40 and get down to ours then? Or do you think your good Yankee friends will shaft the Koreans in favour of our needs?<br><br>Rafale F1 is already in production and has combat missions over Afghanistan. Rafale F2 will start deliveries later this year. F3 is right on schedule. As for the French AF, their Rafale requirements are staggered to ease fiscal pressures and the Dassault production facilities are well-geared to fulfil more orders in between those of the French AF.<br><br>The point is only applicable to the Typhoon, which I have stated before. Nothing new. Then again, production aircraft are rolling off the lines.<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from"></div><div class="quote_body">so when will the RSAF get its first aircraft delivery if it chooses the rafale or typhoon?The typhoon and rafale represents the future MAYBE. but the F15 is NOW.</div></blockquote>The F-15 is now. But we need something for the FUTURE.<br><br>When will the RSAF get its first delivery if it chooses the F-15? With the Korean order in mind.<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from"></div><div class="quote_body">tats why the RSAF will choose the F15.The Rafale and typhoon are simply the pawns of the RSAF to get a better deal from the yanks.</div></blockquote>Do you know that for sure, or did you hear that from someone, or (heaven forbid) come up with that one yourself? After all, you've already mis-represented a lot of facts already.<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from"></div><div class="quote_body">regarding your last question,My definiton of tech transfer is the same as your.but to mi tech transfer is a pretty vague term because there is always the extent and depth of tech transfer to be considered.providing the source code in my opinion is not very deep or extensive.in any way,i think the only reason the french and british r willing to provide source codes to us is because the rafale and typhoon need lots of troubleshooting in terms of systems integration,sure will help their aircraft industry if singapore can contribute to the troubleshooting exercise of their troubleprone national aircraft.Mindef will have no need for the source code of the F15 because its systems are fully integrated and tested already.</div></blockquote>Is that so bad? Troubleshooting source codes will represent a good learning experience for our software engineers while work on the radars will give our engineers and people first hand experience of how that works FROM THE GROUND UP. As I've said before, Singapore is looking to be more than an end-user of hardware, we want to learn how to upgrade, improve, modify and eventually even build and design our own stuff. In other words, self-reliance. With the Americans always looking to sell things with enough strings attached to ensure their end-users end up in knots most of the time without their help, this already represents a gulf in expectations of both parties.<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from"></div><div class="quote_body">Mindef will have no need for the source code of the F15 because its systems are fully integrated and tested already.</div></blockquote>Again, deluded assumptions from you without any consideration of past events. The Yanks have integrated everything they need for THEMSELVES. Which is fine and good FOR THEM. But what they have which we want from them, they might not want to sell us. And what we want that we can get from 3rd parties, how are we going to integrate these 3rd party equipment without the source codes? What then?<br><br>Again, these are events with precedents in the Singapore context.</div>

What's the relevant for 2020?<br><br>1) A2A engagements will happen at longer ranges - assuming your rules of engagement doesn't require eyeballing friend or foe before firing.<br><br><span style="color: blue;">Both Typhoon and Rafale are BVR A2A capable. In fact if one factor the "in development" ramjet powered Meteor, then the Euro-carnards will have an edge against the Eagles/Amraam combo.<br><br>Ok, what about WVR? Both Typhoon and Rafale will eat an Eagle any day given that their agility is better. Now, one might argue that an Eagle can be armed with AIM-9X and JHMS or Python 5/DASH-4 combo, then at best Eagles will only match Typhoon and Rafale.<br></span><br><br>2) RCS will be a major factor - same as navy. Actually if one has networking it is possible to fused RF returns from different platforms in different angles. So then........how?<br><br><span style="color: blue;">In terms of RCS, Eagles sucks big time. Rafale is the best. One thing that Rafale definitely has an edge over its competitors is its ECM suite. You can easily read about it. It has got radar cancelling technology built in.<br></span><br><br>3) More missions will be unmanned - probably NGF as mother ship for mid-course guidance or re-targetting.<br><span style="color: blue;"><br>Rafale has the edge. Dassault is looking at a future growth of Rafale to convert some into UCAV controllers. Eagles - nah, Typhoon? Don't know about EADS plans.<br></span><br><br>4) 2 heads better than one - definitely a must with all the information to digest.<br><br>5) Advanced sensors and datalinks<br><span style="color: blue;"><br>All of the are on par if not Euro-carnards have slight advantage.<br></span><br><br>6) Smarter faster and more agile weapons<br><br>7) Airframe/Propulsion - thrust vectoring relevant? FBW will lighten pilot's burden but that's old stuff, unless you want to talk to the plane?<br><span style="color: blue;"><br>None have thrust vector so far. Dassault and EADS were looking at a growth potential to upgrade their respective products with thrust vectors. Don't know the status now.<br></span><br><br>Seems airframe and propulsion is inconsequential aside from RCS and cost effective maintainability issues. Days of pulling Gs and sucking air are over if technology is what 'they' say it is....... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br>Typhoon is out! Rafale's only selling point is the radar plus potential tech transfer.<br><br>F-15 has all the above with proven LANTIRN BUT minus tech transfer.<br><br>If we need control over the avionics package, best option is to transfer Viper's (Storm will be better) black boxes into an empty F-15E shell.<br><br>Only problem left is the radar which it seems is all there is to the tech transfers that Singapore is after.

            <div class='col-md body'>Read an article on Rafale from jedonline:<br><br>The Spectra EW suite with the active cancellation is powerful if it really works.....for all emitters.<br><br>Passive ESA radar has least system gain and lower range than Active ESA radar?<br><br>The FSO on board maybe superior to LANTIRN? and allows for longer range visual identification of friend or foe.<br><br>Rafale has lots of good stuffs until you think of the ILS costs and probably much longer time to reach IOC compared to F-15E/T.<br><br>Glad to see French going for 2 seaters too which effectively kills the Typhoon.<br><br>My bet for a cost effective JSF fallback is still F-15T with faith (something that's been proven) in DSTA/Israelis/'Free Sex for all lobby' to come up with a work around on the tech transfer and upgrade path perhaps involving F-16E/F (Storm) inserts or F-15I stuffs.<br><br>Answer is clear......to me at least <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br><br>I don't think you can ink this tech transfer and have the implementation go to our expectations.

Would be nice to use that as baseline for continuing pro F-15 direction.<br><br>Answer:<br><br>1) APG63 - No AESA<br>2) ALR56 - Older and less capable than our F-16Ds<br>3) ALQ135 - I think older than mysef<br>4) No FSO onboard - LANTIRN instead<br>5) Helmet mounted sight - nothing new<br><br>Understand that F-15I is also not much better with the ESM/ECM replaced.

There are 2-seat versions available, and they're supposed to be combat capable as well. The consortium's problem is that for too long, they've failed to present a united front regarding development matters and more than once, looked like they're pulling in different directions. I've no doubt they've got a great product, they just need to work more on ironing out some pretty serious issues.<br><br>I'm also not sure that Rafale's "only selling point is the radar plus potential tech transfer". Lets not forget USN F-14s and F-18s were creamed by the Rafale F1s in WVR and the Yanks didn't want to try BVR after that. Arguably the newer F-15s are better aircraft, but I've no doubt that Rafale can hold its own vis-a-vis the best F-15s the Yanks can offer.<br><br>As for the LANTIRN, its OBSOLETE. The other pods on the market, such as Litening II, Sniper etc beats it hands down.</div>

We don't want to find that if for some technical reasons that the Vipers were to be grounded, Singapore would be left defenseless with no planes to fly. (Exggeration of course, but we can't simply count of the 2 F5S sqns to take care of air defence right).<br><br>Second and less obvious reason is that RSAF has already purchase Block 52+ variant, which is not much different from F-16I. Thus, there is absolutely no reason to have an NGF program if the Advanced Block 52 will suffice. RSAF could simply get a further batch and be done with. Of course, the reason of getting NGF is that the Blk 52+ couldn't fulfil the all the roles RSAF (now and in the next 10 years or so) set for NGF.<br><br>RSAF also will not have a distinct edge in the region by having more Blk 52+ Vipers.<br><br>As for comparing this NGF program and the Korean FX program, I think we can expect a different outcome. The Korean FX program actually identified the Rafale as the "best" choice. In fact, the Korean AF wanted Rafales. It was only when US pressured them to re-evaluate their decision, basing on integration issues with US forces in Sth Korea and that Boeing was almost nearly shutting down the F-15 production lines.  If technical merits and the level of tech transfer is dominant in the selection criteria, I believe you will see Rafale beats Eagles over and over again.  I think the French are so very desperate to sell Rafale almost at any 'cost'. Rafale will never be an export success due to the relative poliferation of second hand third gen aircrafts like the Vipers. Dassault's own Mirage 2000 also essentially curses Rafale to be an export failure.<br><br>Sure, the US can "pressure" Singapore to buy USA, but the pressure will not be as great as what they had given to the Koreans. Singapore transparent procument policies and selection criteria also means that they are less likely to be in the position to put undule pressures on Singapore without Mindef threathens more European purchases. Singapore is in the driver seat - not the US!<br><br>The ball  is in Boeing's court. It is up to them to offer Singapore a package we simply can't refuse. Or else, I think Euro carnards are definitely a better choice.<br><br>BTW, there are more procument coming up including the Naval Helos, trainer, etc. I'm sure the US govt won't want to upset Singapore too much huh!<br><br></div>
