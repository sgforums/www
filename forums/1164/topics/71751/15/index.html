Are some of you here the test pilots too, coz you guys also talk alot about air combat manoevures too.<br><br>Some of you guys posts very indepth and interesting articles about the 3 aircraft design backgrounds. Really makes me wonder if this is a forum for qualifed aircraft design engineers.<br><br>Come to think of it, how many of you guys here are CAAS or FAA qualified aircraft maintainers??<br><br>Anyone in here whose work is directly invovled with the rectification of our current supersonic aircraft platforms, and I don't mean as Crewchiefs but I am more interested in the opinions of those who actually rectify the aircraft?? I am talking about people who talk maintenance based on actual experience.<br><br>These are the people who should be commenting on the possible selection winner. All talk here is about aircraft capability, has anyone talked about the maintainability?? So what if it has all the gimmicks on board it ain't worth a jacksquat if the plane cannot even leave the ground because maintenance on the jet is difficult. High tech equipment equals high tech problems too.<br><br>If there are none, then we are all armchair engineers and Playstation test pilots, all commenting based on what we have read only.<br><br></div></blockquote>Hang on a second, you mean we aren't allowed to post opinions and points of view here, unless we're qualified to? Well then, it looks like we're gonna have to shut down the forum won't we?<br><br>As for new = gimmicky = difficult to maintain, why not try the USN's recent experience on for size? They were facing severe problems funding and maintaining the *old* F-14 Tomcat, and were facing serious serviceability problems. When the USS Abraham Lincoln and Nimitz took their *gimmicky* new Super Hornets to war, it was immediately noticed that the new aircraft, while not as capable as the Tomcat in some areas, particularly range, aircraft availability, sortie completion and overall efficiency rates went sky high. I dunno, but there *might* be a lesson in that story there somewhere? Now I'm no fan of the Super Hornet, and in terms of asthetics, will take the Tomcat and "Legacy" Hornet over the Super Hornet anytime, but I gotta admit that it is time the Tomcat should be allowed to retire gracefully.<br><br>As for being qualified and having maintenance experience, I have had shop floor (both "outpost" and depot level) front-end maintenance experience on heavy duty vehicles, so I guess you can say I know which end of the screwdriver is which, and I know the difference between something which is "easy to maintain" and "simple to maintain". And my current job requires me to have more than just a little knowledge of FAA, CAAS, JAA and EASA (and DCA) regulations. My company (who's parent is a global engine manufacturer with a big stake in Singapore's aviation engine market) is looking to secure approval for me to sign airworthiness certificates. Oh, and theres the small thing of me having a degree in Aeronautical Engineering as well. And I know of at least one other regular here who has a fair bit of Aviation Operations experience as well.<br><br>So, am I qualified to discuss this topic, O Wise Old Sage?<br><br></div>

When we are talking abou choosing the NGF, it's not just a choice of the airframe.Considerations in the areas of availabilty of subsystems such as armaments,missiles,navigation/targeting systems developed for the aircraft are also very important.Compatibility of aircraft with existing equpment is also highly desirable.In our case,choosing the F15 will be a great advantage for the RSAF since existing missiles and electronic equpment like navigation/targeting pods for the F16s can also be used on the F15.On the logistics point of view,the F15 is definitely a winner.And remember the aim120 missiles, they are also cleared for firing by the F15s.comparatively,On the other hand,choosing the rafale or eurofighter will be a logistical nightmare.existing systems and missiles in our inventory may not be compatible with these 2 aircraft and probably, the RSAF will have to obtain a whole new set of inventory specifically for the eurofighter or rafale.oh and tat definitely means keeping a separate inventory at least for the ammunition for the built-in guns.of course, keeping a separate inventory may not be a critical factor in choosing the NGF but the total life cycle cost (TLCC)must definitely be one.it doesnt take a mathematical genius to calculate tat the TLCC for the F15 will be the lowest simply because there are that many more F15s flying in the air around the world compared to the rafales and eurofighters.The F15 will continue to be the mainstay of the US and Israel air forces at least for the next 15years,so we can definitely expect more F15 upgrade packages like radars being developed in the future.At this point in time,it is quite impossible to calculate the TLCC for the EF or rafales.Problems inherent in the EF have yet to be solved so the EF is alr out of the race for our NGF.France is the only operator of the rafale currently but we can definitely be sure tat the french will charge a premium for the rafale spares just like when they charge our army exorbitant prices for amx10 spares.Therefore based on price alone,the F15 wins any day.<br><br>Low price alone obviously is not enough in arguing for the choice of F15 for our NGF.Performance is also vital.In this respect,the F15 also wins interms of the payload it can carry and the range it can go.Initially i was expecting the RSAF to go for more F16s but of course we now know that the F16 was dropped.the dropping of the F16 in the selection speaks volumes for wat the RSAF wants.It wants an aircraft that can carry more and fly further than the F16.The aircraft will be used primarily for deep strike interdiction.Your might argue tat among the 3 aircraft the F15 has the largest radar cross-section but i do not think that is a big problem since flying at low level with a comprehensive suite of radar jammers,this problem will be largely nullified.anyway the EF and rafale are not that stealthy even though they r more stealthy than the F15.Being more stealthy doesnt help tat much in avoiding detection with the advances in radar technology.Recall tat the F117 was shot shot down over yugoslavia even though it was supposed to be a stealth plane.Admittedly, the F15 may not be as capable in a dogfight when compared to the RF or rafale but this may not be a deciding factor in choosing the NGF.tat is beacuse dogfights may become less relevant in the future due to more air-to-air engagements taking place at beyond visual range.The RSAF doctrine is to take out the enemy aircraft on the ground before they managed to take off and then to mop up any remaining aircraft that managed to take off at beyond visual range.Dogfights will be the last resort.the F15 can perform this role very effectively and of course it can carry more aim-120s compared to the EF or rafale.<br><br>Anyway I'm very sure the RSAF has chosen the F15 already.Why did you think singapore was so active in supporting the american war in iraq,sending in LST and air tankers for missions in iraq.this is all part of the agreement in exchange for the americans selling us the F15.Why did u think PM Goh and Teo chee hean visited the US recently?To seal the F15 contract before the November Presidential elections in America of course.oh and of course,as part of the deal in supporting the americans in iraq,the aim-120s will now be on singapore soil already.For multi-billion deals,the mindef will always stick to the tried-and-tested and battle-proven like the F16 and apaches.It wont be any different this time.<br><br>As for u saying the F15 is obsolete and no match for the EF or rafale.i suggest u should refer to the israelis for confirmation.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I totally agree that the RSAF should get the F-15S.One might comment that the EF2000, or the Rafale F3 may be newer in design and have more new-fangled stuff.However, we should not forget that this is primarily a programme which will bridge the gap between our Vipers and the JSF.The F-15 already outperforms the aircraft we currently have, and is quite nicely configured to take over the deep strike/bomber role that the A4SU currently undertakes.The Eurofighter may be able to supercruise but we should not base that as one major criteria for selection.After all, why bother trying to develop a comprehensive air-to-air refueling system from scratch and learning all its salient points when you are only concerned with combat radius based on fuel amount from take off.Rafale is not battle-proven and the EF2000 has already met with many hiccups.When it comes to the Army, singapore may take their chances with indigenous equipment.But when it comes to aviation, I do not think the policy of the ministry is that of risk-taking, especially when the risks do not constiute any radical experimentation in the form of unknown technology.The Israelis use the F-15 and I feel we may see their magic done on some Eagles that are flying our way probably quite soon. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"></div>

Well then, it looks like we're gonna have to shut down the forum won't we?<br><br>As for new = gimmicky = difficult to maintain, why not try the USN's recent experience on for size? They were facing severe problems funding and maintaining the *old* F-14 Tomcat, and were facing serious serviceability problems. When the USS Abraham Lincoln and Nimitz took their *gimmicky* new Super Hornets to war, it was immediately noticed that the new aircraft, while not as capable as the Tomcat in some areas, particularly range, aircraft availability, sortie completion and overall efficiency rates went sky high. I dunno, but there *might* be a lesson in that story there somewhere? Now I'm no fan of the Super Hornet, and in terms of asthetics, will take the Tomcat and "Legacy" Hornet over the Super Hornet anytime, but I gotta admit that it is time the Tomcat should be allowed to retire gracefully.<br><br>As for being qualified and having maintenance experience, I have had shop floor (both "outpost" and depot level) front-end maintenance experience on heavy duty vehicles, so I guess you can say I know which end of the screwdriver is which, and I know the difference between something which is "easy to maintain" and "simple to maintain". And my current job requires me to have more than just a little knowledge of FAA, CAAS, JAA and EASA (and DCA) regulations. My company (who's parent is a global engine manufacturer with a big stake in Singapore's aviation engine market) is looking to secure approval for me to sign airworthiness certificates. Oh, and theres the small thing of me having a degree in Aeronautical Engineering as well. And I know of at least one other regular here who has a fair bit of Aviation Operations experience as well.<br><br>So, am I qualified to discuss this topic, O Wise Old Sage?<br><br></div></blockquote>Viper52,<br><br>You talk I listen.<br><br>Yep, you are right.

You qualified, you qualified, it was my personal opinion only. I hope I am entitled that.<br><br>Just because I put forward some of my views on an aircraft other than your favourite it does not mean you can put me down like as though you know everything about aircraft maintenance and aircraft design.<br><br>For that matter you don't even know what my profession is.<br><br>There is no need for you to comment about what I said about souping up the P51-D Mustang. What I put forward was a scenario. No country keeps their aircraft stock standard, meaning having all OEM parts in them. There are always modifications done to suit the orbat. This is what gives them the edge over the neighbours. You always want them to think you have only the basic platform. So a Mustang may not just be a Mustang, neither an F16 be only an F16 or an A4 just a standard A4.<br><br>So if Singapore were to buy the F15, it would never be stock standard too.<br>It could be modified to a point it would kick the hell out of the Rafale and Typhoon.
