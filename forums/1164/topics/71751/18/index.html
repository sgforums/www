The team is doing what they can to see which a/c meets our criteria the best.  as far as the blue world is concerned the F1 5 is not obselete yet.  that is not to say that the EF and Rafale are out of the game.  all 3 are very good at what they do, just that some do it better than others.   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br><br><blockquote>qnh1101, are you part of that team??

As for evidence, what evidence?  are there any pics/visual sightings of our a/c with such systems?  hope not  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br><br>anyway, we digress.  since i'm here, i intend to play by the rules of the game i.e. what ever u guys say, goes.</div>

My contacts and I saw the Rafale flying a lot more often in the 2 weeks after AA2004 than the Eagle, and on weekends too.</blockquote>Hi Vip, barring any unforseen circumstances, we do not see any reason why the flights should not continue, albeit with some other control measures in place.  Yes, we had to run thru more stuff with the Rafale as compared to the F15 given the fact that we had less data abt the former.  but they all did quite well.  met some of our expectations, exceeded others and of course some of the hiccups were unforeseen.  but that's all part and parcel of such matters... you would know now, wouldn't you?  enjoy the weekend!<br><br><blockquote>So any truth to the claims in the previous pages that the contender currently here went u/s a couple of times over here already? I know that one went u/s at Akrotiri on its way over and had to be replaced by a 3rd a/c.</blockquote>let's just say that the aircrew were not too keen to go into the details, but who's to blame them?  personally, i think the EF team deserves a pat on the back for accomplishing such a significant landmark achievement.  this is afterall, their first mission out of Euro.  anyway, got to go soon... it's time for a piss up!</div>

The Israelis can help us upgrade the F-5 and F-16 because they have the computer source codes for both aircraft.

The whole point here is we need that bit of treasure to integrate the a/c into our defence needs.  The F15 has good attributes and performed well during the trials, but unless the US are prepared to throw in the same deal as their competitiors, i'd say that the deal is still touchy...  anyway, it's still too early to say anything.</div>
