            <div class='col-md body'>If anything, the UK's demands, will help rather than hurt the Eurofighter project. By insisting on a strike/ground attack capability for Tranche 2, it is making the Typhoon more attractive to foreign users and hence, bringing down the unit costs in the long run. As it is, the Typhoon is already an expensive piece of equipment, how do they expect to export the aircraft, and hence get back more on their investment, when all they've got is an expensive one-trick pony? Especially when it's pitted against the multirole Rafale, F-15, F-16, F-18E/F, Su-30/35/37 and eventually the F-35.<br><br>Understand the interests of the other member nations in wanting to focus more on the A/A role, but isn't that what the Tranche 1 machines are for?</div>

US does give "special" rates to allies (Rumoured to be, that's how we got 110 A-4)<br><br>F-35 is not getting ex day by day. EF2000 is worst, there is no work at all now (But Britian as agreed to stop its stupid complaint saying it needs better weapons as EF is outdated). But F-35 is confirmed to be capped at US$40 million when launched in 2012 by Lockheed Martin. Even so, it is worth it compared to this lousy EF2000 as it is STEALTH<br><br></div>
