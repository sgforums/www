IAF does not have Block 60. Only UAE has Block60s.<br><br>The last batch of Vipers RSAF purchased was rumoured to be the Block 52+.

As the main crew complement (students) was short term, it made more sense to keep aircraft/perm staff in 1 unit. For a fighter squadron, the admin work required to support more aircraft would be complex. An optimum fighter squadron size is between 12-16 aircraft.<br><br>AJT is for training fighter pilots.

            <div class='col-md body'>G Loading 101<br><br>Actually, pilots can sustain more Gs than airframe depending on aircraft IF we're talking about INSTANTANEOUS G and not SUSTAINED G loading. Formula 1 racers who crashed have survived in crashes in excess of 49 Gs, of course in a measured instant (several milliseconds or sumthing, I dont have the statistics with me).<br><br>Many airframes don't have such tolerances to such instantaneous G loads so if you're in a non-FBW aircraft, it's easy to stress or even destroy the airframe without having you killed by pure G (just pull on that stick really hard, very fast). FBW aircraft usually try to prevent these instantaneous G loads.<br><br>As for missiles, what's most important from my readings is turn radius which is a function of G + speed. Even with a high G (let's say 30G+) missile, due to it's high speed and hence high turn radius, a low G aircraft at a lower airspeed can still outturn a missile (u just have to have the Force with you to turn into a missile if the countermeasures fail). Air to Air missiles are also limited by rocket burn time (again I don't have figures), but i reckon by the time it reaches an aircraft (if fired at the limit of the missile range with good PK), the rockets would have been expended and it's coasting on pure kinetic energy which can easily bleed off when turning for final engagement.<br><br>As a final note, me being the unhealthy smoker type who hasnt exercised in 5 years I reckon I won't last long at 4Gs sustained.<br><br>(all my info is at least a decade old, so I may be wrong with the latest, greatest AAMs)<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by Viper52:</div><div class="quote_body">Yes, there would be high G-forces involved, but the Israelis are tight-lipped about exact figures.

The aircraft would be delivered in the Block 2 configuration, with only software changes and weapons integration tests needed to upgrade to Block 3 about a year later.<br><br>Maj Gen John Hudson, JSF programme manager, says the alternative plan is being developed as potential foreign customers are consulted. "Are Block 2 airplanes a whole year early good enough," says Hudson, "or is everyone going to wait until Block 3?"<br><br>The configurations share propulsion and airframe designs, but have vastly different capabilities. Block 3 JSF would have a full-up weapon system capable of the aircraft's full mission profile, including carrying all external and internal weapons loads. Block 2 could carry air-to-ground precision weapons for interdiction and close air-support missions, but lacks most of its potential air-to-air arsenal, including Raytheon AIM-9X Sidewinders and MBDA AIM-132 Advanced Short Range Air-to-Air Missiles.<br><br>The option is aimed at the UK and Australia, which need to begin replacing ageing aircraft no later than 2012, says Michael Cosentino, Lockheed Martin's director of international programmes. Singapore is another potential customer that would require F-35 deliveries to begin in 2012, but it has not yet signed a formal agreement to enter the programme as a security co-operation participant.<br><br>The US Marine Corps had expected to receive the first operational F-35 in the second quarter of fiscal year 2008, but is now more likely to receive the first aircraft in FY09. The first US deliveries are in the Block 1 configuration, which includes a minimal operational load of Boeing GBU-31 and GBU-32 Joint Direct Attack Munitions and two Raytheon AIM-120 Advanced Medium Range Air-to-Air Missiles.<br><br>The proposed one-year programme extension is part of a draft replan of the original 10.5-year system development and demonstration phase that is expected to be approved by the Defense Acquisition Board on 17 June. The delay raises the programme's total cost from $33 billion to $40.5 billion.<br><br>STEPHEN TRIMBLE / WASHINGTON DC</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>France Helps Dassault Aviation with Singapore Military Jet Competition<br><br>By Pierre Tran, Sunday Business, London Knight Ridder/Tribune Business News<br><br>Feb. 22 - The French government has flown to the aid of Dassault Aviation, signing a E659 million ($850 million, UKpound 441 million) contract that allows the aircraft-maker to build an advanced version of its Rafale jet, which is competing in Singapore's tender for new fighter planes.<br><br>Singapore's $2 billion competition for 20 combat aircraft is a test of Dassault's ability to sell the Rafale into export markets. The French plane is pitched against the Eurofighter Typhoon and Boeing's F-15 Eagle.<br><br>The signing with the French procurement office last Tuesday allows Dassault to go to the Singapore Air Show this week with a contract in hand that assures financing for work on a Rafale F3 fighter-bomber model being offered to the Asian city state.<br><br>Dassault's chief executive, Charles Edelstenne, said the company's share of the development contract would be E457 million. Thales, which builds the radar, will snare E100 million, with the rest shared between electronics company Sagem and missile builder MBDA.<br><br>The contract comes as welcome news to Dassault, which faces uncertainty over a planned order for 59 Rafales for the French Air Force, which had been due last year.<br><br>Because of budgetary problems, successive governments postponed Rafale orders, which led to obsolescence of some of the electronic parts designed a decade ago.<br><br>The contractors and the government have been locked in a dispute over who should pay for replacing the outdated electronics and testing new parts, estimated to cost E200 million to E300 million.<br><br>The government is negotiating over financing the replacements, but that will probably involve a trade-off, which could lead to postponing orders for 11 or 12 jets in the batch of 59 aircraft.<br><br>The defence budget runs to 2008 and an amount has already been earmarked for the Rafale programme, so deferrals would be pushed into the next budget.<br><br>Dassault insists the production line needs an output rate of one and a half jets a month to be viable, and previous plans had been for two planes a month. Deferrals would hit revenues and increase unit costs.<br><br>Edelstenne pours scorn on critics of the Rafale, saying if France had joined the four-country Eurofighter programme, it would have cost 40 percent more to buy the same number of aircraft, because of cost overruns due to Eurofighter's technical hitches.<br><br>Dassault saw a slide in orders for its Falcon business jets for 2003, with only 40 aircraft sold, compared to 72 in the previous year. Edelstenne said 2003 was the worst year in civil aviation in the past 10 years. Most Falcons are sold in the US market.<br><br>Net profit for 2003 fell 5.4 percent to E295 million from E312 million, on sales of E3.3 billion, down from E3.44 billion. New orders dropped to E2.42 billion from E3.52 billion. The outlook for 2004 was uncertain.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I'm from SG buses<br><br>I look with interest with this NGF<br>EuroFighter is not a good plane after all. It is an omnirole (Or Multirole) fighter comapred to the F15T. The EuroFighter is also very expensive, 80 million Euro ($96 million US) compared to a F15T ($40-60 million USD). All these are just my opinion<br><br>The A4SU is a striker plane, while the EuroFighter is omnirole, it is contradicting.

            <div class='col-md body'>Hi, I'm Bob and new to this forum. Please be gentle.<br><br>I was just involved in a nice discussion with a friend of mine this morning, looking out for "purchase patterns", as it were, and we came to the somewhat surprising conclusion that Strike Eagle is in with a shout. Lets have a look at the "purchase patterns" of the SAF:<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Land Systems<br><br></span>A lot of US stuff, but since 2000, we've been making our own.<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Naval Systems</span><br><br>Largely European - principally because the US yards are not into small boats.<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Missile Systems</span><br><br>Apart from I-Hawk and Spike, largely European as well. Which brings us to our item of interest:<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Airframes</span><br><br>Ever since the Hawker Hunters (which were essentially hand-me-down "start your own air force" kits), <span style="text-decoration: underline;">every single one</span> of the RSAF fighter aircraft purchases has been a US make.  The answer to this simple pattern lies less with the fact that we are under any sort of political pressure to "buy American" than with the fact that Singapore's prime priority in choosing an airframe appears to be based on ease of logistics, maintainability, spare part availability and cross-systems compatability.  The F-5E was chosen because it had an impressive production run and in the end, when its production ended, we were still able to buy spare planes from Jordan to cannibalise for parts.  The F-20 Tigershark was offered to us as the Hunter replacement on incredible terms and all signs pointed to it being a very good machine.  Yet in the end, Singapore went for the F-16 and not the F-20 because nobody, but nobody else bought the F-20.  And that's why we don't buy Russian either - they have the worldwide numbers, but what with the factories closing down (as Mig did) and with factories fighting with each other over who makes what (as with the Sukhoi bunch) - Russian reliability for airframe service is essentially a nightmare.<br><br>Simply put,  if your planes do not have the production numbers enough to sustain a long and reasonably cheap serviceability record, Singaporean assessors will always put a big fat "X" in the "cons" column.<br><br>I'm a huge fan of the Rafale. But despite the French throwing everything they have to win the Singaporean contract, the deal seems to be, unfortunately, the least easy to "service" 30 years down the road - plus it's got all those other logistical problems associated with its French armament packages to sort out.  The Eurofighter people, although late to the game, seem to understand exactly what Singapore is looking for in its airframes, plus they have the "outside consortium" Austrian deal to showcase - they come in second.  However a big "con" there is that the Tranche 3 ground-attack version won't enter service til 2008 - that is assuming everything goes according to plan.  Singapore doesn't like to bet on "things going according to plan".<br><br>Point is - don't be too surprised if a 30-year old airframe should win out in the end... unless the assessors see a real need to "buck the pattern".<br><br>What do you think?</div>

Come on, we have already 60 F16CD. You want to have somemore omnirole? Then, there will be no strike capability which is contradicting our deterrance policy (I think most would know of this).
