            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by kingkhong79:</div><div class="quote_body">The F15 is not obsolete. When we are talking abou choosing the NGF, it's not just a choice of the airframe.Considerations in the areas of availabilty of subsystems such as armaments,missiles,navigation/targeting systems developed for the aircraft are also very important.Compatibility of aircraft with existing equpment is also highly desirable.In our case,choosing the F15 will be a great advantage for the RSAF since existing missiles and electronic equpment like navigation/targeting pods for the F16s can also be used on the F15.On the logistics point of view,the F15 is definitely a winner.And remember the aim120 missiles, they are also cleared for firing by the F15s.comparatively,On the other hand,choosing the rafale or eurofighter will be a logistical nightmare.existing systems and missiles in our inventory may not be compatible with these 2 aircraft and probably, the RSAF will have to obtain a whole new set of inventory specifically for the eurofighter or rafale.oh and tat definitely means keeping a separate inventory at least for the ammunition for the built-in guns.of course, keeping a separate inventory may not be a critical factor in choosing the NGF but the total life cycle cost (TLCC)must definitely be one.it doesnt take a mathematical genius to calculate tat the TLCC for the F15 will be the lowest simply because there are that many more F15s flying in the air around the world compared to the rafales and eurofighters.The F15 will continue to be the mainstay of the US and Israel air forces at least for the next 15years,so we can definitely expect more F15 upgrade packages like radars being developed in the future.At this point in time,it is quite impossible to calculate the TLCC for the EF or rafales.Problems inherent in the EF have yet to be solved so the EF is alr out of the race for our NGF.France is the only operator of the rafale currently but we can definitely be sure tat the french will charge a premium for the rafale spares just like when they charge our army exorbitant prices for amx10 spares.Therefore based on price alone,the F15 wins any day.<br><br>Low price alone obviously is not enough in arguing for the choice of F15 for our NGF.Performance is also vital.In this respect,the F15 also wins interms of the payload it can carry and the range it can go.Initially i was expecting the RSAF to go for more F16s but of course we now know that the F16 was dropped.the dropping of the F16 in the selection speaks volumes for wat the RSAF wants.It wants an aircraft that can carry more and fly further than the F16.The aircraft will be used primarily for deep strike interdiction.Your might argue tat among the 3 aircraft the F15 has the largest radar cross-section but i do not think that is a big problem since flying at low level with a comprehensive suite of radar jammers,this problem will be largely nullified.anyway the EF and rafale are not that stealthy even though they r more stealthy than the F15.Being more stealthy doesnt help tat much in avoiding detection with the advances in radar technology.Recall tat the F117 was shot shot down over yugoslavia even though it was supposed to be a stealth plane.Admittedly, the F15 may not be as capable in a dogfight when compared to the RF or rafale but this may not be a deciding factor in choosing the NGF.tat is beacuse dogfights may become less relevant in the future due to more air-to-air engagements taking place at beyond visual range.The RSAF doctrine is to take out the enemy aircraft on the ground before they managed to take off and then to mop up any remaining aircraft that managed to take off at beyond visual range.Dogfights will be the last resort.the F15 can perform this role very effectively and of course it can carry more aim-120s compared to the EF or rafale.<br><br>Anyway I'm very sure the RSAF has chosen the F15 already.Why did you think singapore was so active in supporting the american war in iraq,sending in LST and air tankers for missions in iraq.this is all part of the agreement in exchange for the americans selling us the F15.Why did u think PM Goh and Teo chee hean visited the US recently?To seal the F15 contract before the November Presidential elections in America of course.oh and of course,as part of the deal in supporting the americans in iraq,the aim-120s will now be on singapore soil already.For multi-billion deals,the mindef will always stick to the tried-and-tested and battle-proven like the F16 and apaches.It wont be any different this time.<br><br>As for u saying the F15 is obsolete and no match for the EF or rafale.i suggest u should refer to the israelis for confirmation.<br><br></div></blockquote>A logically thought out post here by kingkhong79 without the need to leverage on the use of technology and electronic gizmos jargon to substantiate the stand.<br><br>There is a lot of difference between "nice to have" and "need to have".<br>In the current economic climate and the Singaporean kiasuism of wanting everything cheap and good....... the choice seems quite clear.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Heres a couple of interesting articles about technology transfer and how Singapore views them.<br><br>=============<br><br>The Straits Times, Page H6 - February 26, 2004<br><br><strong>Share know-how to secure deals here, says DSTA </strong><br><span style="font-style: italic;">By David Boey </span><br><br>DEFENCE companies aiming to land a Singapore contract were told in no uncertain terms yesterday that <strong>their sales pitch had better include the sharing of defence know-how</strong> with Singapore.<br><br><strong>Arms deals with Singapore had stalled when vendors failed to recognise that the transfer of technology could be a deal-breaker,</strong> said the Defence Science and Technology Agency (DSTA), the national authority on military technology and weapons procurements.<br><br>Making the point at a two-hour briefing for some 130 defence companies, Mr Soh Kong Pheng, deputy chief executive (operations) at DSTA, said: <strong>'Many of our suppliers can't understand, or underestimate, the importance we place on having technology transfers... We do this so we can, if we need to, upgrade the hardware. Suppliers can achieve an important competitive advantage if they understand this requirement well.'</strong><br><br>Citing the ongoing evaluations to find a replacement fighter for the A-4 Super Skyhawk, he said the new warplanes might need to work with unmanned vehicles in future and <strong>DSTA also needed to understand how the fighter worked if it were to be upgraded.</strong><br><br>Warplanes being evaluated in the deal, estimated to be worth $2 billion, are Dassault Aviation's Rafale, the Boeing F-15T Strike Eagle and the Eurofighter Typhoon.<br><br>While contractors would not want to give away all their trade secrets, Mr Soh said <strong>'at the minimum' they should ensure DSTA can 'upgrade, modify and integrate' the warplanes at reasonable cost.</strong><br><br>Another key concern was maintenance costs. As much as 40 per cent of the acquisition cost goes to supporting the aircraft through its 20- to 30-year life cycle.<br><br>'We need to buy spares, maintenance and support equipment, and so on. And for readiness reasons, we buy much of these upfront... This is too costly,' he said.<br><br>He suggested that the three warplane makers think up an 'investment strategy' for maintenance to minimise the upfront expenditure.</div>
