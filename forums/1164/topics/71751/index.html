Recently, a test pilot for this state-of-the art jet was in town and he told Channel NewsAsia why he thought the Eurofighter might win the dogfight for the more than US$1 billion contract.<br><br>Craig Penrice has more than 4,500 hours of flying experience in over 40 different types of aircraft.<br><br>Among them the American Boeing F-15 and the Eurofighter Typhoon, which are currently going head-to-head in a dogfight with the French Rafale to replace Singapore's Skyhawks.<br><br>But Mr Penrice, who is now testing the Typhoon, considers it the better of the two and the jewel in the crown is its cockpit.<br><br>"Things like being able to command the plane through voice control. I can do many tasks by simply talking to the plane. In my helmet, I have tactical information so wherever I'm looking, I don't have to look at the displays in the cockpit. Wherever I'm looking behind, outside I still have information available to me, this head-up-head-out looking out the plane is vitally important," he said.<br><br>BAE Systems which builds the Typhoon has been eyeing the Singapore contract for more than 4 years now.<br><br>Buying a new generation fighter jet is not a simple task.<br><br>It's much more complex than buying a new car for example. The technical details are so sophisticated and complex, BAE Systems specialists get questioned by MINDEF officials on technical issues a few times a day.<br><br>This is why Mr Penrice was in town recently to give the Defence Ministry his perspective as a Typhoon test pilot.<br><br>"Because we know what it is that the service pilot needs out of his airplane. Engineers appreciate that knowledge and they do listen to us. But with all the best intention something doesn't quite work as envisaged, we report on that and we discuss it and we come up with a plan to improve it," added Mr Penrice.<br><br>BAE Systems' Typhoon Export Programme Director, Andy Wilson, said: "The next phase we'll have to put formal information in front of the authorities here in terms of the specifications and costing data. All of that will be evaluated and assessed by the Singappore government before making their preferred choice."<br><br>Singaporeans may get a glimpse of the Eurofighter Typhoon next month at Asian Aerospace.<br><br>But the Defence Ministry is not expected to make its final choice till 2005. - CNA<br></blockquote></div>

However, the extent of that support is unclear.<br><br>Defense procurement agency DGA reaffirmed on Feb. 2 that an audit ordered to evaluate whether existing Rafale delivery timetables can be maintained --as well as who will pay for the impact of previous stretchouts-- would have no effect on export sales. In particular, the DGA said the review should not affect a Singapore air force competition to be decided later this year. The Rafale has been shortlisted for the 20-aircraft purchase, along with the Boeing F-15 and Eurofighter Typhoon.<br><br>A dozen Rafales are currently in service with the French navy on the Charles De Gaulle aircraft carrier. These have only the basic F1 software package, with a limited air-to-air engagement capability, although a second flotilla with upgraded software is to be added over the next five years.<br><br>Moreover, the DGA confirmed that a contract for development of a software upgrade designed to add a strategic strike, reconnaissance and antiship capability to the Rafale--the basis for the export version being offered to Singapore-- would be awarded by month's end. Known as F3, the upgrade is intended specifically for the new ASMP-A missile that will equip France's nuclear fighter-bomber fleet, but it will serve conventional applications as well.<br><br>In addition, the DGA insisted that further delays to the program, which is already 10 years late, would not affect the planned dates for introducing the aircraft into service with the French air force. This is expected to be another key element in the Singapore selection.<br><br>The first air force squadron equipped with the current F2 software--intended to improve air-to-air combat capabilities and add a surface strike dimension-- will become operational in 2006, as planned, the DGA said. The F2 package will allow the Rafale to carry the new AASM modular standoff weapon and Scalp cruise missile, integrated with the Damocles laser designator pod.<br><br>The first F3 nuclear-armed Rafale squadron will enter service in 2008, about in line with Singapore's target for initial operational capability. This version will be associated with a new-generation reconnaissance pod and other improvements. On Feb. 10, the DGA issued MBDA an award to adapt the MM39 airborne version of the Exocet antiship missile to the multirole version, as part of a larger Exocet upgrade award.<br><br>Furthermore, the agency said new delays would not influence the total number of Rafales to be acquired(294), and in particular a pending buy of a new batch of multirole aircraft to supplement the 61 on order. The government said this purchase, which had been expected in 2003, would go ahead this year, although it did not specify whether the buy would cover all 59 aircraft originally planned. In fact, officials noted, a lower delivery rate could actually benefit the Rafale in Singapore, by freeing up production slots.<br><br>For their part, Dassault Aviation executives noted that the second issue in the audit--who is to pay for extra costs to replace obsolescent electronics stemming from past delays-- will affect only existing F1 standard aircraft, not future purchases. Replacing these components will entail considerable redesign, testing and rejigging of production that could cost several hundred million dollars or more, they indicated.<br><br>Nevertheless, despite broad evidence of the government's good will, Dassault officials--mindful of past refusals to support export upgrades with state money-- remain unsure of the ultimate level of public commitment. True, Singapore has been offered the possibility of using air force training facilities in Cazaux, France, and participating in development of a new RBE-2 active-phased array antenna radar for the Rafale(AW&amp;ST Nov. 10 , 2003,p.19).<br><br>But Dassault considers that a French government commitment to the RBE2, which is only at the demonstration stage, may be crucial to the outcome. Currently, France does not plan to launch development of the radar until 2008. The RBE 2 would permit use of the new-generation Meteor beyond-visual-range weapon, to be introduced in 2012, as well as an all-weather metric-precision AASM version and future suppression of enemy air defense systems(AW&amp;ST June 23 , 2003,p.3.<br><br>No indication was given about the number of aircraft that might be affected by the possible delivery cutback. But the two air force squadrons would account for around 40 of the 76 aircraft to be delivered by 2008, and the naval flotilla for a dozen more.<br></blockquote></div>

Although the F-15C and Su-27P series are similar in many categories, the Su-27 can outperform the F-15C at both long and short ranges. In long-range encounters, with its superior radar, the Su-27 can launch a missile before the F-15C does, so from a purely kinematic standpoint, the Russian fighters outperform the F-15C in the beyond-visual-range fight. The Su-35 phased array radar is superior to the APG-63 Doppler radar in both detection range and tracking capabilities. A few F-15Cs are equipped with the APG-63(V2) Active Electronic Scanned Array (AESA) radar and Fighter Data Link (FDL). Additionally, the Su-35 propulsion system increases the aircraftÂ’s maneuverability with thrust vectoring nozzles. Simulations conducted by British Aerospace and the British Defense Research Agency compared the effectiveness of the F-15C, Rafale, EF-2000, and F-22 against the Russian Su-35 armed with active radar missiles similar to the AIM-120 Advanced Medium Range Air-to-Air Missile (AMRAAM). The Rafale achieved a 1:1 kill ratio (1 Su-35 destroyed for each Rafale lost). The EF-2000 kill ratio was 4.5:1 while the F-22 achieved a ratio of 10:1.

            <div class='col-md body'>theres only one choice for the rsaf and tats the F15.its battle-tested and proven technology and the rsaf always go for tried and proven hardware.the eurofighter was never a contender simply because its too new,Germany and britain are still testing it and the orders from these 2 countries for the eurofighter are only going to be totally fulfilled after the year 2010.the rsaf needs a new attack aircraft now and not 6 years later.the french rafale is also new and not really thoroughly tested yet,anyway its stil much more expensive than the F15 in terms of aircraft and life-cycle costs.the question is not just a matter of selecting an aircraft but also the armament that comes with it.not too sure if the rafale is compatible with the full range of american missiles such as the maverick or aamraam tat we now have in our arsenal.the F15 also can fly farther and carry more payload compared to the rafale.if the F15 is good enough for israel,south korea and japan then its good enough for the rsaf.plus spares will not be a problem simply because there are much more F15s flying around compared to the french rafale.</div>

Unless the French really doesn't intend to sell Rafale to other countries other than Singapore (which is not true, they are trying to sell it to other Guilf country and possibly India), they cannot afford to screw Singapore like they did with Taiwan, Iraq and Israel.</div>
