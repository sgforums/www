            <div class='col-md body'>Hi all,<br><br>I have become somewhat saddened that after my original post a couple of days ago about how Strike Eagle cannot be written off etc, the forum on the NGF* has deteriorated a little into a slanging match with no small amount of "Who says so?! I did!? Yeah so what!?".  It was actually my first time posting on any forum ever and I was under the mistaken impression that there would be a lot of passionate opinionating, sure, but opinions would be backed up by the truth.  Reading all the recent posts makes me feel like I was in Secondary 2 again and there was this guy trying to covert me to this religion or other and I was asking him about evolution : "Why didn't evolution take place?" , I'd ask... "Cos the Book said so!" came the cheery reply. "But why did the Book say that?", I'd counter... "Cos evolution didn't take place!" *Grin*.<br><br>Sbs guy - I am not casting any aspersions - you may really be curious about why Singapore is looking at the planes we are looking at and why not just "get the Gripen for photo shoots and [insert your fave "striker plane" here - I'm still not sure what it is] for Singapore".  But you have a knack about making (frankly speaking), wildy exaggerated statements about weapons systems and, when confronted with a helpful explanation, responding with "I KNEW THAT - but what about [insert another topic]?".  A forum is for expressing your opinion, sure, but remember we are not talking about abstract subjects here - instead we are talking about a topic with a lot of widely publicised open source info - you'd do better to read something other than Huxley before you post and when someone corrects you - accept it in the spirit of info exchange and constructive help. We are all friends united by a common interest in the end.....<br><br>To set you straight about a few of your remarks:<br><br>1) " It [the Eurofighter] has become infamous as well, quite a lot of accidents involving Eurofighter." - I have heard of ONE case of a EF flameout - an early DA6 platform out of Toldedo, Spain using prototype engines.  That hardly qualifies for "quite a lot of accidents".  A casual online search finds at least one F-15 crash per year since 2000 in the US alone.  A YF-22 Raptor late model prototype crashed in 1992.  TWO F-18 prototypes crashed during testing.  What do the crashes mean? No too much, I'd reckon - just so long as the problem is identified and rectified and planes don't fall out of the sky willy-nilly. So - please stand corrected.<br><br>2) "Singapore is one of the largest operators of the F-16C/D outside of the United States" - I have done a survey using online sources (primarily F-16.net - great site that).  I discount countries and planes which either operate the F-16 A/B or even have F-16 A/B's "upgraded" to C/D standard.  i.e. the survey only covers countries who have bought C/Ds "straight off the market".  There are 11 countries which operate C/Ds outside the US (Bah, Chile, Egypt, Greece, Israel, Oman, Poland, Sing, South Korea, Turkey, UAE).  So, splitting it down the middle, if Singapore is among the Top 5 operators (numerically speaking) of those 12 countries - your statement is true. That should be fair, yes?  Well gues what - Singapore is number seven - behind Egypt (200+), Greece (140), Israel ( well duh!), Turkey (240), South Korea (180) and even little UAE (80).  It isn't even the largest operator in Asia - see South Korea.  So - please stand corrected.<br><br>My final point is - lets stay on course here.  Explain why you think one of the three contenders among the Strike Eagle, Typhoon and Rafale has an edge, and why you think the evaluation team will pick it.  You can throw in a lot of pictures too - I love pictures! But in the end, be happy to know that what we will purchase will be an order of magnitude more kick-ass than we have ever operated before - then go breed some kids without 500 degree eyesight!<br><br>Cheers all,<br><br>Your friend,<br><br>HiI'mBob</div>
