            <div class='col-md body'>Hi, I try to provide some things I know, to get a better impression of the three contenders.<br><br>(1) The Eagles that took part in Cope India 2004 were from Elmendorf, Alaska, but they where not equipped with the APG-63(V3). On the other side, the Indians had "only" Sukhoi 30 <strong>MK</strong>. The newest variant, Su-30 <strong>MKI</strong> was not involved. Further more, the Indians had their Flankers only armed with AA-10 Alamo's, not R-77. The outcome is of course great for both sides. The Air Force can now justify the Raptor and the Indians the investment in the Flanker.<br>(2) The Typhoon is able to fly in every weather. There were some things mixed up. Since Typhoon is pretty new, it was not cleared for it. This means not it is unable to do so. It was a simple act of burocracy. It had to get verified by all 4 nations involved as well as the NETMA.<br>(3)I would like to point you at something: While the Typhoon has more internal fuel, the Rafale has <span style="font-style: italic;">at the moment</span> the advantage of larger external tanks. (2000l compared to 1000l of the Typhoon) The Eagle has the largest maximum range, while Typhoon is the only contender able to supercruise. Maybe someone with more insight in some stats could provide which AC has the largest range at M 1,2. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br>(4)Typhoon is compatible to European AND American weapons.<br>(5)The Eagles airframe is the most prooven, but it's weapons system is pretty new, the same for it's EW-suite.<br>(6)The French were able to proove that the EW-suite of the M2k was superior to other NATO aircraft in joint exercises. The Typhoon is the only one that provides already a towed decoy.<br>(7)The Eagle is at the end of it's service life, while major upgrades for Typhoon and Rafale are already underway or planned for the future. A hidden plus for the Eagle is the possibility of Israelian upgrades. BUT F-15I and the proposed F-15T are partly different aircraft avionics wise, so there is a big question mark behind compatibility with Israelian systems...</div>

(this is the Flyaway price), this compares very well with the competition.<br><br>Range is also ablout the same, radar performance is difficult to say the RBE2 has less range than the Captor, but better is some modes, less good in reliability.<br><br>The Typhoon is easy to maintain MMH/FH is very good, its less than the contracted figure of 9, and is excellent in comparison.<br><br>Now if you want some fun with figures heres a rough guide to finding your NGF<br><a href="http://www.eurofighter.starstreak.net/Eurofighter/tech.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.eurofighter.starstreak.net/Eurofighter/tech.html</a> under National Evaluation.<br><br>Enter how important each criteria is out of 100 in each box and press Compute results, this will give you a best fit on technical grounds, (Please read the caveats ;-) )<br><br>If you put 100 in only one box and press compute results it will show you the weighting we have given each aircraft in that area.<br><br>When finished, use the menu's at the top of each page to explore the site, its stuffed full of info from reliable sources.<br><br>ENJOY!<br><br>BTW AD is a twin...<br></div>

Plain old problems. Nothing a patch repair or stop drill cannot resolve. No need to mess with hazardous chemicals, vapours or materails.<br><br>The fallout that is the byproduct of burning composites are sometimes extremely dangerous when inhaled. Stay far away when expoxy graphite composites are burning, its ashes when inhaled will probably kill you.<br><br>Composites are the in thing when it comes to weight savings. The use of composites is very evident in the F1 cars. And look at their brake discs, lightweight  carbon fibre. But one knock, and it all goes to pieces. Composites tend to be lightweight, brittle but extremely strong as strong as metal sometimes like kevlar for example.<br><br>Most of the time patch repairs are not recommended and normally the damaged part is changed out as one whole piece so as not to compromise the strenght of the entire assembly. Can be quite an expensive affair.<br><br>The trouble is composites are relatively new and so it is not fully developed yet. The problem of moisture entrapment has always been the Archilles heel of this new technology. Maybe in a few years time they may come out with a winner.<br></div>

Well, you've just emphasized your point.<br><br>True, moisture absorption is a serious problem in composites, and that is already a well documented fact. But then again, the world of composites is vast, and while certain types of composites do absorb moisture rapidly, there are other types which don't. We don't know exactly what kind composites go into the aircraft, so to make a sweeping statement like, "Composites absorb moisture, this region is humid, so composite aircraft = bad" is plain wrong.<br><br>The RSAF and SIA have had plenty of experience operating aircraft with composite compenents, the S.211, F-16 and even our helicopters use composites in many areas, and SIA's B777s and A340s have no shortage of composites in their makeup as well, so don't put it like it is the first time aerospace composites are being introduced in aircraft based in our country. so its the first time Singapore is looking at aircraft with that much composite components in them, but then its not like our operators and maintainers don't have experience with such materials.<br><br>Lastly, I don't think the assessment team needs us to tell them what to look out for.<br><br>Jwcook, thanks for the links. I believe all 3 contenders have their strong plus points and their own minus points, so I will not rubbish any of them like some of the other posters, but based on capabilities AND asthetics I have to disagree with you and go for the Rafale.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote>Originally posted by Silat:<br><strong>Hi, I try to provide some things I know, to get a better impression of the three contenders.<br><br>(1) The Eagles that took part in Cope India 2004 were from Elmendorf, Alaska, but they where not equipped with the APG-63(V3). On the other side, the Indians had "only" Sukhoi 30 [b]MK</strong>. The newest variant, Su-30 <strong>MKI</strong> was not involved. Further more, the Indians had their Flankers only armed with AA-10 Alamo's, not R-77. The outcome is of course great for both sides. The Air Force can now justify the Raptor and the Indians the investment in the Flanker.<br>(2) The Typhoon is able to fly in every weather. There were some things mixed up. Since Typhoon is pretty new, it was not cleared for it. This means not it is unable to do so. It was a simple act of burocracy. It had to get verified by all 4 nations involved as well as the NETMA.<br>(3)I would like to point you at something: While the Typhoon has more internal fuel, the Rafale has <span style="font-style: italic;">at the moment</span> the advantage of larger external tanks. (2000l compared to 1000l of the Typhoon) The Eagle has the largest maximum range, while Typhoon is the only contender able to supercruise. Maybe someone with more insight in some stats could provide which AC has the largest range at M 1,2. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br>(4)Typhoon is compatible to European AND American weapons.<br>(5)The Eagles airframe is the most prooven, but it's weapons system is pretty new, the same for it's EW-suite.<br>(6)The French were able to proove that the EW-suite of the M2k was superior to other NATO aircraft in joint exercises. The Typhoon is the only one that provides already a towed decoy.<br>(7)The Eagle is at the end of it's service life, while major upgrades for Typhoon and Rafale are already underway or planned for the future. A hidden plus for the Eagle is the possibility of Israelian upgrades. BUT F-15I and the proposed F-15T are partly different aircraft avionics wise, so there is a big question mark behind compatibility with Israelian systems...[/b]</blockquote>Great points Silat1, its good to see some unbiased points expressed by QNH1011 and you here. Nice change from all that biased bashing of some contenders by some other posters here.<br><br>Anyway, the aircraft which took part in Cope India were from the 19 Fighter Sqn, 3rd Wing from Elmendorf Alaska. They deployed to India after a Commando Sling in Singapore. And they are the ones in the with the APG-63(V)2 AESA. While the radar being offered to Singapore is the improved (V)3, the improvements are mainly reliability-focused, and not capabilities-based. <a href="http://www.fas.org/man/dod-101/sys/ac/docs/n19991208_992202.htm" rel="nofollow">More info on the APG-63(V)2</a><br><br></div>
