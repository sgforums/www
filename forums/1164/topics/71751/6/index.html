Which one of the above has the highest priority?<br><br>Because NGF is going on 2020, there's some serious concerns on the technology on board being the latest with potential for further upgrading.<br><br>I think deep strike missions will be unmanned (cruise missiles) by 2020 and NGF with all the technology maybe irrelevant by then.<br><br>JDAM production line I read somewhere only requires less than 10 ppl to run.

My guess is that they don't need that big of a plane, otherwise why is the Midef considering Rafale and Typhoon and not Su-30 ? The thing is, Singapore wants a twin-engine plane and M'sia is getting the F-18E, therefore the only American product that can be proposed if the F-15.<br><br><blockquote><br>I can see the technical superiority of Rafale on paper.

I don't think so...<br><br>Cost of spares for the Rafale could be expensive because of the small production numbers, but soon the F15 will not be produced anymore.

The F35 will replace the remaining F5s and then progressively replace the F16s, as what the USAF intended to do.<br>If the F35 program is delayed, we will have at least the NGF requirement to fallback on. I believe if the F35 is delayed, the urgency to regenerate the USAF inventory will be the more urgent, and less likely for countries like Singapore to opt for early delivery. The way I see it, we are more likely to receive our first batch in the 2015~17 timeframe at the earliest.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Guys, if you look at RSAF ORBAT, then you will realise that RSAF constantly maintain 3 types of platform, with 1 outgoing/phasing out, and the other as replacement.<br><br>Generally, there will be 1 type dedicated for strike and maritime roles. This has been fulfilled by the Skyhawks till now. One type to fulfil the interceptor/fighter with secondary strike role. This is currently fulfilled by the F-5. The last, being the multirole and probably supposed to be the best air asset (or what I'll call RSAF air superiority fighter). This is currently the Vipers in the inventory.<br><br>Looking at things, the Vipers are earmarked to replace the Skyhawks in the strike, interdiction and maritime role. The NGF will be purchased to fulfil currently Viper's role. and in the future, the JSF will replace the NGF role while the NGF will replace the F-5 fighter/interceptor/secondary strike role.<br><br>Basically, the trend started in the 80s, with the<br>F-5 being the (top air superiority fighter for RSAF), the Hunter playing the inteceptor/fighter/Recon  with secondary strike role, the the Skyhawks, the dedicated strike aircraft.<br><br>Came the 90s, where the Viper became the air superiority fighter, the F-5 upgraded and  replacing Hunters, the Skyhawk upgraded to continue its role.<br><br>Come the new Millenium, we will see the NGF taking over the Vipers as the air superiority fighter, the Viper taking over the Skyhawk, and the F-5 remain where it is.<br><br>Come post 2010, we will see the F35 taking over NGF, NGF taking over the F-5's role, and the Viper (possibly upgraded) remain predominantly for strike roles (being the most numerous type just as its predecessor  - the Skyhawk).<br><br>Sounds logical?<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"></div>

The deal, which includes an unspecified financial commitment, assures the country an early slot in the JSF production line. Singaporean officials have suggested to their U.S. counterparts that they would want to buy JSFs early in the next decade to meet their modernization needs. U.S. officials also say Singapore may be interested in at least some Stovl aircraft after the U.S. Air Force announced a desire to buy a few of those models.</div>
