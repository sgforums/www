The NGF should have already been selected by now if not the the financial crisis recently. The timetable has slipped by 2 years, so everything has been pushed back. I think we would see NGF taking IOC sometime in 2008, JSF maybe in 2012 to 2015 timeframe. By 2010, NGF will become the mainstay of RSAF air superiority fighter, JSF is more like to replace NGF in this role betweem 2015 and 2020.<br><br>Post 2020, my prediction is UCAV <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br></div>

And it was on a training flight - not, as many people in the region had believed, involved in a stunt to publicise the 11 Oscars won by the latest Lord of the Rings film. Many thousands of people witnessed the formation of the ring - or rings, according to some accounts - late on Monday afternoon.<br><br>Mike Easton, 50, a chartered surveyor, photographed the phenomenon as it formed due west of his home at Blofield, Norfolk. "It was a nice sunset so I stuck my head out of the window and saw this amazing circle. It was pretty impressive," said Mr Easton.<br><br>Initially it was thought that a Tornado jet from RAF Marham, north Norfolk, or a Jaguar from RAF Coltishall, near Norwich, could have been responsible. But both bases said their aircraft were not involved.<br><br>Then, late yesterday, a USAF spokesman at Lakenheath, Suffolk, said one of its F15s was responsible while carrying out "a routine manoeuvre".<br><br>Lt Ed Ekpoudom said: "The pilot said he was just doing a manoeuvre at 33,000ft at around sunset when the conditions were conducive for a vapour trail to form. He is surprised to hear how it appeared from the ground."<br><br>Â© Copyright of Telegraph Group Limited 2004.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I am quietly reflecting on the need for a NGF.  Surely, can't our air force engineers make our F-16Ds good enough to match the Su-30 and Su-35 in air-to-air combat?<br><br>I am also thinking of several good planes that are reasonably good as NGF although these are third-generation aircraft, namely the F-16E/F, the F/A-18E/F and the Mirage 2000.<br><br>What would we lose if we brought say a Mirage 2000 instead of a Rafale, considering it a choice we make after putting the airaraft through a computer simulation, the wind-tunnel and through actual flight sorties carrying various payloads for various mission types.<br><br>I think that we might have the political will to see through a purchase of the Rafale which is my choice, because its a semi-stealth aircraft, with a good radar, good lethal munitions mix, good flight performance, a bit slow at M1.8, a pair of high-performance engines, a good airframe with many composite parts, a conventional ferry range that is second to the F-15T, a digital library for the construction and design of the aircraft, source code availability and co-operative design work opportunities, integration with stand-off missiles which Singapore may equip for but not buy because of the political sensitivity of missiles with extended ranges such as the Storm Scalp EG etc.<br><br>Possibly the issue of having a MICA equipped Rafale is hot enough, because MW missiles are probably non-jammable and they operate very well in dense ESM/ECCM conditions.<br><br>Morever, the ASMP missile which is nuclear-capable to 200KT has been developed specifically for the Rafale, and can be sold as a conventional model to Singapore. This could cause quite a fair bit of unease, plus the range of shorter-range cruise missiles on the horizon such as the Storm Scalp EG/Storm Shadow, the KPED etc which would be very useful in interdiction, naval strike, stand-off, precision strike etc.<br><br></div>

My name's Andrew .....something.  You seem to be carried away by a new car such as the NGF, and you obviously ignore developments going around the world, especially those in the backyard of Singapore; other than panic over Indonesia's possible purchase of Su-35?  Perhaps, you really fear having the Indonesians run Singapore?<br><br>[/quote]</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I think we should get the Rafale. F-15T the oldest design out of the 3, and the yanks not very supportive of technology transfer. I can't say or know whether Rafale or Eurofighter is better aircraft, but if i not wrong, Rafale can carry heavier payloads, and i think sharing developments on a new radar is good for us, and i think the French also more desperate for the deal, so we might squeeze more stuff from them.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_twisted.gif" alt="Twisted Evil" title="Twisted Evil"></div>

This has been fulfilled by the Skyhawks till now. One type to fulfil the interceptor/fighter with secondary strike role. This is currently fulfilled by the F-5. The last, being the multirole and probably supposed to be the best air asset (or what I'll call RSAF air superiority fighter). This is currently the Vipers in the inventory.<br><br>Looking at things, the Vipers are earmarked to replace the Skyhawks in the strike, interdiction and maritime role. The NGF will be purchased to fulfil currently Viper's role. and in the future, the JSF will replace the NGF role while the NGF will replace the F-5 fighter/interceptor/secondary strike role.<br><br>Basically, the trend started in the 80s, with the<br>F-5 being the (top air superiority fighter for RSAF), the Hunter playing the inteceptor/fighter/Recon  with secondary strike role, the the Skyhawks, the dedicated strike aircraft.<br><br>Came the 90s, where the Viper became the air superiority fighter, the F-5 upgraded and  replacing Hunters, the Skyhawk upgraded to continue its role.<br><br>Come the new Millenium, we will see the NGF taking over the Vipers as the air superiority fighter, the Viper taking over the Skyhawk, and the F-5 remain where it is.<br><br>Come post 2010, we will see the F35 taking over NGF, NGF taking over the F-5's role, and the Viper (possibly upgraded) remain predominantly for strike roles (being the most numerous type just as its predecessor  - the Skyhawk).<br><br>Sounds logical?<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"></div></blockquote>WAh wah...really makes sense sia! I think its going to happen as wat u say! But i personally think it'll be really cool if RSAF get F-15T's for your air superiority fighter/pride of the RSAF role, F-35 JSF for inteceptor/fighter/Recon role, and Rafale for the strike/interdiction role. But hey, not going to happen i think.........</div>
