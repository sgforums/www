The US pressure could be the reason behind it, the source added.<br><br>Mirage 2000-5 is one of the four aircraft alongside the USAÂ’s F 16 and F 18 competing for the IAFÂ’s multi-million dollar proposal to acquire 126 fighters. The other two competitors are RussiaÂ’s MiG 29 M and SwedenÂ’s Saab-Grippen MRCA.<br><br>The decision to acquire the 12 Mirage 2000-5Â’s from Qatar was taken earlier this year by the Cabinet Committee on Security (CCS ) chaired by Prime Minister Manmohan Singh.<br><br>The CCS was endorsing the commitment by the previous NDA administration two years ago to purchase the used Mirage 2000-5Â’s in order to prevent Qatar from selling them to Pakistan.<br><br>This was when the IAF was in advanced negotiations exclusively with Dassault for 126 Mirage 2000-5 fighters to strengthen its strategic deterrence capability.<br><br>During his visit to Qatar in January 2003, former deputy prime minister L K Advani had reportedly told the Sheikhdom that India would curtail an important gas deal if the jets were sold to Pakistan and not to the IAF.<br><br>QatarÂ’s Emir Sheikh Hamad bin Khalifa Al-Thani visited Delhi in April 2005 and held a series of meetings with senior Indian officials including Defence Minister Pranab Mukherjee indicating that the Mirage 2000-5 was a Â“done dealÂ” barring formalities.<br><br>Dassault was also to be part of the agreement with the IAF, involved in refurbishing the fighters before the aircraft joined service sometime later this year.<br><br>In June, an IAF delegation led by S K Sharma, joint secretary (acquisitions) and a two-star IAF officer visited Qatar and proposed paying $ 375 million for the fighter jets, an amount Â“wholly unacceptableÂ” to the Emirate, a foreign armament source said.<br><br>Â“The IAFÂ’s inexplicably low offer is bound to be turned down,Â” an armament industry source said, hinting that the omnipotent US armament lobby was at work. Defence Minister Pranab Mukherjee, he said, was already under attack by the Communist parties for Â“giving inÂ” to the US lobby in signing the Defence Framework Agreement.<br><br>Prime Minister Manmohan Singh is going to the US later this week during which the purchase of the American fighters would feature prominently amongst other military matters, a senior Defence Ministry source said.<br><br>Defence analysts said WashingtonÂ’s feud with France over the latterÂ’s opposition to the Iraq war had recently been manifesting itself in armament sales.<br><br>The US had successfully Â“spikedÂ” FranceÂ’s deals for fighters with Poland and South Korea recently, they said.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>The choice for the RSAF should be the Rafale F3. It is never advisable to depend on one country for an important asset such as combat aircraft. Choosing the French aircraft over the USA this time would not only further cement our booming ties with the French but force the USA to give greater leeway to Singapore in future arms deals. My guess for the RSAF is 20 Rafales to be delivered from 2008, a further batch of 20-24 to be taken in 2010-2011, followed with an acquisition of a first batch of F-35A fighters (30+?) from 2014 onwards. Such a spread out purchase would enable Singapore to effectively phase out the remaining TA-4SU Skyhawks from 2008 and all the F-5S/T light fighters from 2010-2015.<br>A first generation UCAV such as a scaled-up MAV-1 would hopefully see service with the RSAF in the 2015-2016 period.<br><br>Just my two cents worth for my very first post...<br><br>Comments anyone?</div>

I heard presently DSTA is working with Dassult on the finalise the spec on Rafale. They still not fully satisfy the Rafale F3 spec yet.</div>
