David Lomax reports on the project's political dogfighting and costly mishaps<br><br>It is 10 years late, Â£6 billion, if not more, over budget, and the RAF still hasn't got one in squadron service. And next month, the Eurofighter, Britain's biggest defence procurement project, will face a crucial export challenge.<br>Click to enlarge<br><br>Singapore, which needs to update its air force, will evaluate the Eurofighter's performance against French and American rivals. An overseas sale might offset some of the Â£20 billion which the aircraft has so far cost the British taxpayer - the equivalent of three Channel Tunnels or Railtrack's costs for the next five years - and would be much-needed encouragement to a four-nation collaboration which has been plagued by cost over-runs and difficulties for two decades.<br><br>Apart from a modest purchase by Austria and orders from the countries where the aircraft is being built, the UK, Spain, Italy and Germany, the Eurofighter has not been sold anywhere. At the Dubai Air Show last month, it was only present as a model while its rivals cavorted overhead in spectacular flying displays. The RAF was supposed to be getting 232 of them but there are still problems with the aircraft's electronic systems and it will not be in squadron service until 2006, and then only in the basic form of an air-combat version, which critics claim is a relic of the Cold War and should have been scrapped years ago.<br><br>Early in the 1980s officials from the departments of industry and defence were concerned about the threat from the Soviet Union's new generation of jet fighters. There were exploratory talks with Germany, France and others about a European collaboration. John Nott, the then Secretary of State for Defence, was lobbied to release funds for a European fighter design contract. He had just closed Chatham Dockyard, and was running down Portsmouth. Jobs were going to be lost in marginal seats, so it was difficult for him to sanction the loss of more, and as Mr Nott wrote in his autobiography, there was "grave concern in the industry because it was running out of work".<br><br>Another concern for government was that British Aerospace was a promising candidate for privatisation, which eventually occurred in 1985. The company could not be left to collapse. British Aerospace argued that the new European fighter concept ought to be allowed to the preliminary experimental stage. If not, it predicted that BAe would fold and the design teams disperse. Reluctantly, in 1982, Mr Nott released Â£300 million for the start of design work to keep jobs and the company's value high.<br><br>Michael Heseltine, Mr Nott's Europhile successor, grasped the project with enthusiasm but could not accept a French proposal that the aircraft should be based on a French design. France withdrew and went on to design its own Rafale fighter. (A squadron is now in service with the French navy.) In 1985 the four surviving partners signed an agreement committing themselves to building up to 750 Eurofighters. The cost of 250 for Britain was estimated at about Â£7 billion. The RAF's first squadron was to have been in service by 1992.<br><br>The collapse of the Berlin Wall in 1989, however, overturned the strategic thinking on which the Eurofighter had been based. The costs of German re-unification encouraged a rising chorus of dissent within the country's parliament over the new aircraft. Why did Germany need it? Volker RÃ¼he, the defence minister, argued that Germany either had to have a cheaper aircraft or pull out of the project altogether. He had inherited MiG-29 squadrons from the old East German Air Force, so had a cheap alternative.<br><br>The discussions to persuade Germany to return took more than two years while design teams waited for instructions. Sir Donald Spiers, who, as controller aircraft at the Ministry of Defence, was managing the Eurofighter project, argued that the parties had already spent DM15 billion on the design and asked whether they really wanted to go back to square one. He told me that it is impossible to work out what the German delay meant - but keeping the design teams at the BAe factory at Warton in Lancashire added "many, many millions" to the growing bill.<br><br>In 1992, with the Germans back on board, production restarted. Already delayed and over-budget, the delivery of the first Eurofighter was postponed until 2000. The numbers the RAF was due to receive were cut from 250 to 232 - and there were further delays. Specifications kept changing and there were constant technical problems. The worst came from the lack of overall management and an agreement about how the work on Eurofighter should be divided, with each country trying to get its hands on new technology. Not only were different parts of the Eurofighter built in different factories in different countries, there were anomalies stemming from the work-share agreement itself.<br><br>According to Air Marshal Sir John Walker, the former head of defence intelligence, Britain's share of a third of the work meant that British companies could only bid for a third. This meant that the rest did not necessarily go to the most experienced and skilled contractors. "Not the best way of designing an aircraft," he told me.<br><br>The development of the flight control system was another casualty of national rivalry. The British had already designed a system that would have worked satisfactorily, according to Prof Ivan Yates, a former deputy chief executive of BAe, "but the Germans wanted the lead on the flight control system. They saw it as crucial technology and insisted on designing their own version from scratch - another reason for delays".<br><br>These delays were highlighted in a National Audit Office report in 1995, which put the total cost of the project to the taxpayer at Â£14.5 billion and said development work was three years behind schedule and overall equipment costs had increased by 56 per cent.<br><br>There was worse to come. In November 2002 a Spanish Eurofighter crashed on a test flight near Madrid. It had been flying at 45,000 feet when its engines suddenly stopped and its two-man crew was forced to bail out. They were not hurt, but the accident meant that the test programme was halted pending an investigation. A German audit office report into the Eurofighter in August last year said that the Spanish crash "was not caused by human error or the extreme demands of a test flight . . . It appears to have been attributed to the simultaneous firing of both afterburners, which should have been a normal operation in a fighter aircraft. Moreover two experienced test pilots merely activated both afterburners in level flight. It is particularly worrying that this should have led to a crash eight years after the first flight of the prototype".<br><br>The German report said that only eight Eurofighters would have been delivered to the Luftwaffe by the end of the year instead of the 15 originally promised. The performance of these aircraft was inadequate, the report said, with significant flight restrictions. Eurofighters were not cleared to fire their cannon or to carry ammunition for them and, because of potential problems, had to be operated at no more than 20 minutes' flying time from an airfield.<br><br>The first Eurofighter Typhoons, as they are now called, are being handed over to air forces in the four manufacturing countries. The RAF has at last got its hands on a few machines but they are still being tested and have merely been moved at the BAe factory in Lancashire into a different hangar with an RAF flag outside. All Eurofighters were grounded recently because of problems with the landing gear and brakes. The manufacturers described these as "teething troubles".<br><br>Even someone as close to BAe Systems (the name for British Aerospace after it merged with GEC's Marconi Electronic Systems in 1999) as Air Chief Marshal Sir Patrick Hine, the company's former military adviser and now consultant, admits that there is still much work to be done. The first batch of Eurofighters will be the air-to-air combat versions. What the RAF really needs, according to the former head of RAF Strike Command, is the ground-attack version, but Sir Patrick acknowledges that the engineers will still have to integrate all the weapons systems, and the ground-attack type will not be in squadron service until 2010 or 2014. This will mean even higher costs "which will have to be worked out with the MoD and RAF".<br><br>Throughout the project the MoD and British Aerospace have emphasised the numbers of jobs the project has generated. In July 1997 the late Alan Clark MP, a former Conservative defence minister, told the Commons in a debate about the Eurofighter that there must be "a more efficient way of paying people to make buckets with holes in them".<br><br>There are now similar criticisms from the former head of defence intelligence. Air Marshal Sir John Walker says a much more effective job-creation scheme would have been to have given Â£1 million each to 20,000 start-up companies.<br><br>Sue Willett, a defence analyst and long-standing critic of the Eurofighter, sees wider implications. "The project has taken such a big chunk of the budget that it's having a knock-on effect on all the armed services. Spares and ammunition have been cut back," she said to me.<br><br>"The delays and cost over-runs are demoralising for the troops and have caused many internal procurement problems." She claims that the project was deliberately excluded by Tony Blair from the last Strategic Defence Review and that it is now "out of control".<br><br>Lord Heseltine still maintains that he "negotiated the biggest deal Britain had ever done to give Britain potentially the leadership of fighter aircraft development in Europe". But this view isn't shared by his predecessor, who launched the Eurofighter. "It was a terribly bad decision," Sir John Nott told me. "One of the worst decisions I made at the MoD."<br><br>David Lomax's History of the Eurofighter is to be broadcast on BBC Radio 4 at 8pm tomorrow.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>MBDA's Meteor Missile Begins Initial Tests<br>Aviation Week &amp; Space Technology<br>05/03/2004, page 15<br><br>Edited by Patricia J. Parmalee<br><br>Back on the Path<br><br>Fit trials of the MBDA Meteor air-to-air missile have been carried out on the Saab JAS 39 Gripen fighter, in a process eventually leading to an initial firing during 2005. The trial was intended to examine mechanical interfaces between the missile, aircraft and multi-missile launcher pylon. Meteor is a six-nation European program, led by the U.K., to develop a successor to such missiles as the Raytheon AIM-120 Advanced Medium Range Air-to-Air Missile. Sweden's defense materiel agency, the FMV, is providing the Gripen as a test-platform for the program. France, Germany, Italy and Spain also are partners. Meanwhile, BAE Systems has powered-up all four Rolls-Royce BR710 turbofan engines on the first Nimrod MRA4 prototype. Low- and high-speed taxi trials will follow--prior to the aircraft being flown--sometime during the second or third quarter this year. Positive initial flight trials are a key milestone in getting the much-delayed program even remotely back on track.<br><br><img src="http://www.aviationnow.com/media/images/awst_images/large/AW_05_03_2004_1839_L.jpg"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>YFC??? We're talking about military Air Forces that spend millions of dollars on simulators alone. And with today's current technology (and with the right price), you can develop a Sim with 360 FOV, simulate weapon launches, Air to Air dogfights, Air to Ground attacks, simulate actual aircraft handling characteristics, all with motion sensors as well. And I wouldn't be surprised if one day future Sims will be able to provide 'G' forces inputs while u're dogfighting in a Sim.<br>Contrary to what u think, pilots normally start off in the Sims first, get familiar with all the avionics before proceeding to actual flight, to reduce the steep learning curve. But Kingkhong is right, Sims will never replace actual flying, not yet anyway.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>let me recap what u said<br><br><blockquote>Contrary to what u think, pilots normally start off in the Sims first, get familiar with all the avionics before proceeding to actual flight, to reduce the steep learning curve. </blockquote>u said pilots, not fighter jet or helicopter, but pilots. so its not wrong that i say the 'pilots' don't fly sim b4 going to the real a/c. so its not wrong that i say that even student pilots learing to fly the ct-4 are consider under the 'pilots' catergory u mention.<br>its true that fighter pilots go thru sim training during their conversion but its done concurrently with actual flying. and actual flying outstripes sim flight. you can log sim hours in your log book but the af requirement is for them to log actual flight hours in order to claim flying allowance. u think our pilots want to go fly sim whole day and cannot claim $. let's get back to the topic of f-15 conversion. the usaf have a tough f-15 conversion for its pilots. b4 911, there was a webpage by a usaf pilot who was going thru his strike eagle conversion. he documented his flights and he started off straight by flying the eagle. going solo on his 3rd flight. he didn't spend alot of time on sims and its done concurrently. rsaf is willing to spend billions to get these planes, u think they never consider the cost of flying? they are willing to pay in order for our fighter pilots to log actual flying hours than in sims.<br>in the commercial world, sia pilots go thru sims b4 they fly the actual a/c. the cost of setting aside a plane to instruct pilots is too costly, they have to maximise the usage of the planes to earn revenue not training. and for your info, the sia sim center is operated 24hrs 7 days and even when you sleep there are pilots flying it. if you say commercial pilots i agree wif you.<br><br>in future, its true that fighter conversions will start off with alot of sims b4 flying the real thing cos those fighters F/A-22, F-35 doesn't come with 2 seat trainer versions. for f-15, typhoo and rafale, its still fly and sim together.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>1. Based on the previous threads, you questioned the need for fighter pilots to start training on the F-15 simulators, when there are plenty of F-15 available to fly. My point was that flying the Sim is actually more cost effective than flying the actual aircraft, and in this context, since we're talking about converting pilots to F-15, it is naturally more cost effective to start training on the F-15 Sim first to be accustomed to the procedures and avionics before sending pilots to fly the F-15.<br><br>2. Since this thread is about Singapore's NGF, when I say pilots I was referring to fighter pilots. I apologise for being ambiguous.<br><br>3. I agree that actual flying is done concurrently with sim training during conversion, and actual flying outstripes sim training. That is why I said the Sim is a good complement to flying, and doesn't replace actual flying.<br></div>
