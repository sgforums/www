            <div class='col-md body'>ST. LOUIS, March 16, 2005 - The Boeing Company [NYSE: BA] revealed the first F-15K Strike Eagle fighter aircraft for the Republic of Korea Air Force (ROKAF) today at the Boeing site in St. Louis, Mo.<br><br>The aircraft unveiled at the event completed its first flight March 3 and is the first of 40 F-15Ks being built for the ROKAF. The ROKAF is investing $4.2 billion for the 40 F-15Ks and deliveries will begin this year and end in August 2008.<br><br>Â“Boeing is thankful we can produce this world-class fighter for the Republic of Korea,Â” said Jim Albaugh, Boeing Integrated Defense Systems president and CEO. Â“It has advanced technologies and weaponry never seen before on any F-15.Â”<br><br>Albaugh emphasized the incredible teamwork between the United States and the Republic of Korea to the hundreds of employees, customers, and suppliers in attendance at the rollout ceremony.<br><br>An advanced derivative of the U.S. Air Force F-15E, the F-15K is the worldÂ’s most capable long-range, multi-role fighter. It can perform air-to-ground, air-to-air, and air-to-sea missions during day or night, in virtually any weather. It can carry more than 23,000 pounds of payload, reach Mach 2.3, and incorporates the latest military technologies. These include the APG-63(V)1 radar, a Joint Helmet-Mounted Cueing System (JHMCS), infrared search and track, third-generation navigation and targeting systems, and weapons-control systems supporting advanced weapons such as the Joint Direct Attack Munition (JDAM), Harpoon Block II, Standoff Land Attack Missile-Expanded Response (SLAM-ER), Advanced Medium Range Air-to-Air Missile (AMRAAM) and AIM-9X Sidewinder missile.<br><br>Â“Integration of the worldÂ’s best multi-role fighter into our force will certainly be a great momentum in improving our air powerÂ” said General Lee, Han-ho, the Republic of Korea Air ForceÂ’s (ROKAF) Chief of Staff, at the rollout. Â“Moreover, the F-15K will enhance the interoperability between ROK and U.S. Air Forces. I believe that this new fighter jet will make a great contribution in maintaining the solid ROK-US combined operational posture.Â”<br><br>A unit of The Boeing Company, Boeing Integrated Defense Systems is one of the worldÂ’s largest space and defense businesses.

            <div class='col-md body'>Hi guys,<br><br>I am new in this forum, but I am a very straight person.  I will say whatever I feel.  If I am going to upset anyone.  I apologise first...<br>What is the point of comparing F-15T or Rafale?  I am a Rafale supporter, but I am not the one buying, the Singapore Gov't does and when the Big Brother (Bro Bush)say "either you are with me or against me", Singapore is screwed...So bottomline.  If there is no drama, F-15T is expected to fly above our head in the near future...So sad...</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hello,<br>I am new here and a Korean national.<br><br>Speaking of the ROKAF F-15K case, many people here were deeply disappointed when the government announced it three years ago. Rafale was the more popular choice among the local military enthusiasts then for the same reasons as you do now. It seemed more agile, modern and politically-justifiable, taking account of anti-American sentiment among the young people.<br><br>But since then, F-15K has proven itself to be rather a smarter choice due to a currency swing and it is now almost 25 percent cheaper in Korean won than Rafale. In addition, its performance and operational capability promised by Boeing certainly satisfy the ROKAF requirements. They have wanted a big deep-penetration fighter-bomber with air-superiority capability after all, for which Rafale is not. Further, F-15K delivery, logistic build-up and technical transfer are all on schedule. Would the French have provided us the same if the selection was made otherwise? I doubt it because of their internal problems.<br><br>I hope the RSAF would make a final decision on NGF best fit to their requirements anyway.<br>And my one final remark is that the ROKAF has just announced the second batch (40 units) of the future fighter purchase, certainly for F-15K, which will bring the total number of the fighter to 80 in their inventory.<br></div>
