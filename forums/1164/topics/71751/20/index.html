            <div class='col-md body'>I was just rereading some threads and here's some more comments...<br><br>1. The restrictions to vision in the Typhoon due to the canards that some posters have refered to, is very very  tiny, and not really a problem, as least as far as I could see!.<br><br>2. Aircraft AD was still U/S at Akrotiri on the 8th, but may be due back this weekend.<br><br>3. Composites are sometimes more resistant to moisture than conventional airframe metals, The Typhoon has been designed to be deployable around the world, including bloody cold to bloody hot weather.<br><br>4. The Rafale has a lot less composites than the Typhoon.<br><br>5. Composites require new methods of repair, the composites on the typhoon are designed to show damage, and the Structural health monitering system kepps a check on the airframes health( it should report any unusal flexing or bending or nasty popping cracking type noises)<br><br>As for Vipers52 comments re capabilities AND asthetics, I have to agree the Rafale looks better, however capabilities are another story!.<br><br>Its rather like French Poodles and British Bulldogs, the poodles look nicer, but which one would you like guarding you ;-).<br><br>The Typhoon is at a disadvantage because its early in its development, the Rafale is ahead in its development, Its much much better to say 'Rafale can do this now' rather than 'Typhoon will do that (better)in six months'.<br><br>The Typhoon has an advantage in the spares and logistics department, there's quite a few novel ways to support your fleet with the Typhoon, having Eurofighter hold some of your spares or only paying for the flight hours are a couple of new concepts.<br><br>If Singapore is eventually going to get the JSF,  then the Typhoon is quite a good choice, both the UK and Italy will be operating JSF/Typhoon fleets, they will have paid for the intergration and they must feel that both aircraft fulfill a different need/requirement/role.<br><br>Thats about all for now, hope the evaluation is going well..<br><br>Cheers<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>After reading some posts about composites, one could think you wrote about salt or sugar.<br>They have shurely some disadvantages compared to metals, but in general they are lighter, more resistant against <strong>vibrations</strong> and especially in the high end sector don't tend to catastrophic breakdowns.<br>Maintainance wise more critical are shurely the Al/Li parts used in the Typhoon. The Russians had large problems with Al/Li alloys, and they have the most experience with this material. But they are only used for leading edges, so that they are probably not welded, which caused most of the problems.<br>Further more, composites fatigue at a much lower rate. One possible problem is that components made of composites often occupy more space then comparable parts made of metals.<br>What I don't know is how delamination can be checked without destruction of the airframe. For corrosion are many methods known, so this maybe a plus for metals. Ultrasound scannings could be a solution, but here I am no expert, maybe someone else knows more.<br><br>As nearly noone here seems to like Typhoon, I try to give some arguments in favour of it.<br>It is supposedly the best fighter for following reasons: Best supersonic acceleration and agility (important for BVR angagements). The only contender beeing able to supercruise. Better radar tracking range compared to Rafale, comparable performance to APG 63. TVC already tested, intended for integration in tranche 3 (improves not only agility, but STOL capabilities, power output, reduces drag,....)<br>For WVR engagements, Iris-T and ASRAAM are available. The Libelle flight suit is the most modern available.<br><br>The man hours are phenomenal low, well below the 9 mh/fh from the contract.<br><br>Many weapons from different countries are available for Typhoon, including U.S. weapons already used by the RSAF. It is the only platform armed with the most modern western ARM's, including HARM(USA), ARMIGER(Germany) and ALARM(UK).<br>There will be three different AShM's available: Kongsberg NSM(Norway/UK), Harpoon(US) and (probably) RBS15Mk3 (Sweden/Germany).<br>Nearly the same can be said about  ALCM's and PGM's.<br><br>For the Rafale and the Eagle only one source for weapons and spares is available. (The proposed F-15T has an different weapon's system, so Israel is not for shure a source).  U.S. weapons available for export will be integrated in Typhoon. Examples are JDAM and the Paveway series. If the 4 European EF-nations don't get it, than Singapore won't get it, too. Additional, the four EF-partners integrate many different weapons. For example Germany uses the Taurus ALCM, while Italy and UK use the Stormshadow/ScalpEG  which can be found on the Rafale, too.</div>

The restrictions to vision in the Typhoon due to the canards that some posters have refered to, is very very  tiny, and not really a problem, as least as far as I could see!.<br><br>2. Aircraft AD was still U/S at Akrotiri on the 8th, but may be due back this weekend.<br><br>3. Composites are sometimes more resistant to moisture than conventional airframe metals, The Typhoon has been designed to be deployable around the world, including bloody cold to bloody hot weather.<br><br>4. The Rafale has a lot less composites than the Typhoon.<br><br>5. Composites require new methods of repair, the composites on the typhoon are designed to show damage, and the Structural health monitering system kepps a check on the airframes health( it should report any unusal flexing or bending or nasty popping cracking type noises)<br><br>As for Vipers52 comments re capabilities AND asthetics, I have to agree the Rafale looks better, however capabilities are another story!.<br><br>Its rather like French Poodles and British Bulldogs, the poodles look nicer, but which one would you like guarding you ;-).<br><br>The Typhoon is at a disadvantage because its early in its development, the Rafale is ahead in its development, Its much much better to say 'Rafale can do this now' rather than 'Typhoon will do that (better)in six months'.<br><br>The Typhoon has an advantage in the spares and logistics department, there's quite a few novel ways to support your fleet with the Typhoon, having Eurofighter hold some of your spares or only paying for the flight hours are a couple of new concepts.<br><br>If Singapore is eventually going to get the JSF,  then the Typhoon is quite a good choice, both the UK and Italy will be operating JSF/Typhoon fleets, they will have paid for the intergration and they must feel that both aircraft fulfill a different need/requirement/role.<br><br>Thats about all for now, hope the evaluation is going well..<br><br>Cheers<br><br></div></blockquote>Good comments , JW!<br>Had been following this thread closely, and I have to admit this is getting really interesting. As for your last comments about the integration of Typhoon and JSF, I have to say this could be a very important leverage point for Singapore to factor in on the selection process. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br><br></div>
