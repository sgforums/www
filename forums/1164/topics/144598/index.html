            <div class='col-md body'>Apparently, the sale of the eagle to singapore is a life and death situation to the development and production of the Eagle. Recently, Boeing had delivered the last Eagle to ROK and some of them are basically upgraded surpluses. Production is now not going on and US is opting for F22 and JSF. Well. Im sure Boeing is sweating at this deal.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>i like the eagle a lot but i think a platform designed and built in the late 60s to early 70s leave very little room for incorporating future mission needs and new technology.<br><br>should go for rafale. need a newer airframe to buy time before the F22 can come online (if we ever can/will buy them).<br><br>combat records doesn't mean much. F14 (another great plane i like) have great combat records but grumman didn't sell to anyone else besides Iran.<br>F4 have some good fighting record too, and it's from an earlier era. and it is still being use in some AF. might as well buy that. (i know it's out of production).<br><br>bottom line, get rafale. i think boeing was invited for political reason. same as in the case of ROK. and i think the koreans' pretty dumb to be buying them<br></div>

Now the aging fighter is just a long shot in its own country.<br><br>Jim Albaugh, chief executive of Boeing Integrated Defense Systems, says the<br>odds are against the U.S. Air Force signing a multiyear deal to buy more F-15s.<br>That assessment isn't surprising as the Pentagon prepares to spend billions of<br>dollars over the next few decades for the F/A-22 Raptor and F-35 Joint Strike<br>Fighter, two planes under development by Lockheed Martin Corp.<br><br>Still, some influential members of Congress say the Air Force needs a hedge<br>against production delays or cost overruns. They believe the F-15 can play an<br>important role in keeping the country's dwindling inventory of fighter jets at<br>a healthy level during the transition to the Raptor and JSF.<br><br>One potential scenario has the Air Force buying anywhere from 100 to 144 F-15s<br>as insurance against a slip in the JSF program, according to people familiar<br>with informal discussions that started about two years ago.<br><br>That would be a boon for the F-15 program. Production of the storied combat<br>plane will end in 2008, unless Boeing wins more orders. St. Louis defense<br>workers have made more than 1,500 of the F-15s. The first F-15A flight was made<br>in 1972.<br><br>Currently, the most hopeful market for more F-15s is Singapore, which could<br>make a decision as early as next month on whether to take the Boeing plane or a<br>French-made fighter in a competition worth an estimated $1 billion.<br><br>Albaugh, meanwhile, isn't raising hopes for any big orders from the U.S. Air<br>Force.<br><br>"Oh, I think that would be kind of a long shot," Albaugh told the Post-Dispatch<br>in a telephone interview last week. "Obviously, that depends on our customer<br>and what they want to do. Right now, I think that's a real long shot. But I<br>think there's an opportunity for us to extend the F-15 line by winning the<br>competition in Singapore. I think there's an opportunity to get some additional<br>airplanes in Korea. And it would always be nice to have a warm production line<br>in the event our U.S. customers decide they want some more."<br><br>If more F-15s are ordered, Boeing would be able to deliver them at whatever<br>build rate is desired by the U.S. Air Force, Boeing said in a statement earlier<br>this month.<br><br>Rep. Duncan Hunter, R-Calif., chairman of the House Armed Services Committee,<br>suggested that Air Force fighter procurement needs a boost, especially in the<br>early years of Raptor and JSF production.<br><br>"There's only one alternative," Hunter said at a committee hearing earlier this<br>month. "And that's to bridge that gap between that little bitty inventory of<br>aircraft that we're going to have in the future of (Raptors) and Joint Strike<br>Fighters, and that would be to produce more F-15s and F-16s."<br><br>Hunter is worried the Pentagon may be writing off the F-15 and F-16 too<br>quickly.<br><br>"Would we not need to maintain production on those two aircraft well into the<br>future, even as those lines, at least with the F-15, are going cold here<br>shortly?" he asked at a committee hearing that included Lt. Gen. Stephen G.<br>Wood, the Air Force's deputy chief of staff for plans and programs. "... I<br>don't see another answer."<br><br>The Pentagon's current Quadrennial Defense Review will help answer questions<br>about the future of the F-15 as military leaders discuss fighter jet force<br>requirements. But Wood made it clear at the House Armed Services Committee<br>hearing that the F-15 won't be at the forefront of those discussions.<br><br>The Air Force will push hard on "articulating the importance" of the Raptor,<br>for example. The Bush administration's defense budget sharply reduced planned<br>deliveries of the Raptor to 179 planes. The Air Force's stated goal calls for<br>getting 381.<br><br>When Hunter asked Wood if there's a need to have bridge production of F-15<br>aircraft, the general said he couldn't rule it out, especially when you assess<br>the uncertainties that come with developing new fighter jets.<br><br>"If we can't get more (Raptors) and we have significant slips in the (Joint<br>Strike Fighter) program, we're going to have to continue to look at bridging<br>that, and it's very viable to look into other aircraft," the general said.<br>"But, sir, I would tell you that we're working very hard in the Quadrennial<br>Defense Review to make the case that the nation needs 381 (Raptors) and to keep<br>that line going."<br><br>Reporter Tim McLaughlin<br>E-mail: tmclaughlin@post-dispatch.com<br>Phone: 314-340-8206<br><br>http://www.stltoday.com/stltoday/business/stories.nsf/story/F386B1BFEFD9B4628625704E00320F3E?OpenDocument<br><br></div>
