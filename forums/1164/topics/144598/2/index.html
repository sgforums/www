            <div class='col-md body'>It takes time to integrate electronics, avionics and other technologies.  Singapore wants it's fighters by 2008.  Hence one of the reasons why the Eurofighter was eliminated from the competition (I like th Eurofighter too), cuz RSAF didn't think it would be available in time with what RSAF wanted.<br><br>The Rafale would be a great choice with all the advance bells and whistles.  But, will it be able to do it in time.<br><br>There was a mention that equating buying the F15T to having a Mustang (great WWII aircraft btw altho I prefer the Corsair better) with AMRAAMs.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"><br><br>But the thing you are forgetting is that aircraft development has slowed.  Way back then new types of aircraft were introduced every year.  The Brits had the Hurricane and the Spitfire.<br><br>As for having an aircraft for many years, didn't we only just retire the Skyhawks?  Believe they were in service in 1950s.  That's about 50 years too.<br><br>I'm not a strong proponent of the Rafale or the Eagle, but I think it's going to come down to who can get us the aircraft by 2008 with all the technologies and weopons integrated, and ability to do the job, and do it well.</div>

These have been extensively upgraded in service. However with the introduction into service of advanced strike aircraft such as the F-15I and F-16I, the Kfir C7/CT7s are being withdrawn from service. Some of the still new airframes are on sale to Latin American countries while the majority will be scrapped.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>COme on la ppl!!! dun support such an old piece of junk! okay its not really junk but its damn friggin old la. Its not even next generation!!! omg it'll be a flying coffin next time when the Raptors start flying. 1960's aircraft... omg i think im going to cry...<br><br>Rafale better newer smaller.. which takes up less runway. but im worried about the electronics. F-15 will be much easier to integrate the stuffs but Rafale is also possible to cram in stuffs on our own. Besides if we have something other countries do not have, we can have our very own classified ace in the hole which only we know. For example a special programme or electronic that can jam up an entire city or something which works only on Rafale.. not Eagle. then we have the upper hand when a need for such a thing arises.<br><br>F-15T<br>Okay 2008 minus 1970 thats a good 38 years, usually SG uses the aircraft for 40-50 years<br>so when it finally retires the eagle i mean, the airframe would have been 78 years old. HOLY FCUK! then maybe singapore consider the raptor to replace it -.-!!!<br><br>This whole thing is down to politics la... if US cuts singapore some major trade/defense agreement heavily weighted in our favour i think SG will be swayed. But the idea of the french designed stealth frigate working with the rafale brings smile to my face.<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cry.gif" alt="Crying or Very sad" title="Crying or Very sad"> F-15T 30 years down the road.

            <div class='col-md body'>I don't think anyone here particularlly supports the F15T.  I personally like the Eurofighter.  But what we support or otherwise, doesn't make a difference.  The evidence now points to a but of F15Ts.<br><br>Obviously the air force thinks it meets their needs.  Or can be modified to the point where it can meet its needs for the next few or rather 20 years.<br><br>And also it meets their need to have a fully developed aircraft by the time they want it.<br><br>Aiyah, as an earlier statement said lah, fire AMRAAMs from 10s of kilometers away, turn on jammers and jink for all you are worth.<br><br>And to deliver bombs on target, you don't need the latest aircarft to do it.  As long as it carries a heavy load, drops it with as good accuracy as the next, is able to cram the latest electronics and flies decently (and the F15 still does).<br><br>The JSF is probably at least around another 10years to delivery to Singapore (if we are that lucky), by then we can use them for air-to-air, and hav ethe F15 focus on air to ground.<br><br>And just to point out something, the recently retired skyhawks were designed in the late 50s.  And we just retired them.  They gave pretty darn good service and the Isrealis loved them too, so much so they only retired them recently as well.  No one can argue with them that they don't know aircraft ya?</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Our friendly Allied Nation X has really done a wonderful job in copying Mirage 2000, just look at the China J10 is the one of the showcase of their techological know-how.<br><br>But F15T may not be the best plane to fly IMHO. Why?<br>1) The fuel consumption is too high<br>2) Need tons of service parts and logistic to support the flying time. This is not feasible in our Singapore scenrio.<br>3) Need long run way to take off<br>4) US maybe not investing any more $$ and tech into this plane, as they are looking already at UCAV. Thus, they are cutting the JSF and Raptors orders, since these UCAV will be complimenting the new advanced jets into the future battlefield action.<br>5) Neighbouring Sikkoi are quite dangerous foe for our F16 or even F15T.<br>6) The time required to config the fighter from attck role into air superiority role will be critical, as singapore needs to response fast to the development of the battlefield.<br>7) Thrust vectoring engine tech is not available.<br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"> Combat mission source code in not available from US most of the time.<br>9) A lot of legal terms to agree upon before the use of the US supplied fighter.<br>10) Source of spare parts are limited and always controlled.<br>11) ECCM &amp; ECM tech from US is always not available, thus our F16 needs to be fine-tuned by our friendly allied Nation X on Planet earth.<br><br>Unless, we get a good wonderful package deal that include tech knowledge transfer and industrial partnership and cross-trading deal. Looking ahead of the technological advancement, the F15T headroom for further developement is more limited compare to Rafale.<br></div>

Fuel still burns alot because it is a very big and heavy plane. AESA radar according to some other forum bros say can be integrated into Rafale( the thales and dassault thing?) no intention to flame hor  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>IMO i think there is a limit that what you can change to a plane/airframe. I still believe the Rafale has more room for modding. =) besides not many people know what techies can do to a rafale since it is not common. So in that sense it can be our silver bullet against other foes.</div>
