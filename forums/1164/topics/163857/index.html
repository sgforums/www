            <div class='col-md body'>KALAIKUNDA, NOV 17: As the Cope India 2005 Indo-US air force exercises wound down today after two weeks of feverish action in the eastern skies, the US Air Force were left with a stark, double-edged realization.<br><br>One Â— that it is no longer the unchallenged leader in the skies, and twoÂ—for all future joint operations in South Asia, the IAF would, without doubt, be its natural partner.<br><br>Advertisement<br>Vice Commander of the US Pacific Air Forces Lt Gen Dave Deptula said: Â‘Â‘I have never seen a better executed exercise in my 29 years with the USAF. This will go a long way towards establishing peace and stability in the region. Every single objective of this exercise has been met. It was not the US against India. It was an exercise on how to operate together.Â’Â’<br><br>Admittedly, the two forces still have much to learn from each other, especially in procedures and operational routines. Both sides said that given an immediate security threat, the two forces now had the capability to fly together in response. Â‘Â‘We will now be prepared if called upon in the future for a contingency, unnamed and unknown. We will be in a position to respond. We can get onto the task of resolving crisis situations together without wasting time,Â’Â’ Lt Gen Deptula said. Today, the two sides flew a rare high value airborne asset (HVAA) attack simulation over Kalaikunda, which principally illustrated the cohesive nature of this round of war games. In the mission, the USAFÂ’s E-3 Sentry AWACS aircraft was escorted by American F-16s and Indian Su-30s in a scenario where the AWACS was attacked by a hybrid mix of American F-16s, Indian Mirage-2000s and Su-30s. In the words of one of Mirage pilots, this, more than any of the other maneuvers in the last weeks, epitomized what Cope India was about. Air Marshal Fali Major, Eastern Commander, said: Â‘Â‘This exercise simulated a hot war scenario in a conventional setting. It was not about terror.Â’Â’<br><br>During the last Cope India exercise in February 2004, American F-15 pilots had admitted finding it bizarre that their Indian counterparts had routed them in many maneuvers. This time round, the buzzword was a studied Â‘jointnessÂ’, though pilots told this newspaper off the record that the IAF had maintained its Â‘Â‘one-upÂ’Â’.<br><br>Source <a href="http://www.indianexpress.com/full_story.php?content_id=82154" rel="nofollow">http://www.indianexpress.com/full_story.php?content_id=82154</a></div>
