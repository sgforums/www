A fourth air base, in Sembawang, is used mainly for helicopter operations.<br><br>The 200ha Changi Air Base East boasts a 3km runway, a control tower, a logistics complex and other state-of-the-art facilities manned by about 400 RSAF personnel.<br><br>Siting the air base at Changi has made it easier for the air force's planes to head east to the South China Sea for training, given Singapore's limited air space.<br><br>The commander of Changi Air Base, Colonel Andy Tan, 44, added that the new air base will need to coordinate the flights of the RSAF's planes with the civilian aircraft flying in and out of Changi Airport.<br><br>Having civilian and military aircraft landing at the same time, on their separate runways, was 'one of the key challenges facing us because of our close proximity to Changi Airport'.[/i]</div>

Compared to existing airbases, because they were inherited from the British we were not able to implement some of these systems because of the cost considerations."<br><br>Its location gives it an advantage over other airbases like Tengah or Paya Lebar.<br><br>Colonel Andy Tan, Changi Air Base Commander, said: "Aircraft from those bases have specific routes to fly to get out of the airfield. They have to meet altitude restrictions because of the congested airspace over the island."<br><br>The F-16 jets from Changi can make a faster trip out to training areas over the South China Sea, compared to their counterparts from other airbases.<br><br>The 145 Squadron can save as much as five to seven minutes in travel time, which means they also save on fuel and cut down on costs. - CNA<br><br></div>

Maximum sustained speed Mach 1.89 (1247 mph) at 40,000 feet. Tactical radius (hi-lo-hi interdiction on internal fuel with six 500-lb bombs) 360 miles. <span style="color: red;"><strong>Maximum ferry range 2450 miles with maximum external fuel (excluding 600gal. tanks or CFT's) . </strong></span><br><br>Quoting Tsahi Ben-Ami and Zvi Kreisler. both of the IDAF, <strong> "Lockheed, which lost the last Israeli aircraft tender to Boeing in 1994, said its single-engine F-16 aircraft could now fly as far as the twin-engine F-15I offered by Boeing. Lockheed has developed attachable fuel tanks that increased the range of the F-16s radius of operations to 1,500 km (800 miles). Israeli pilots tested the F-16 in the United States in 1999 fitted with the new fuel tanks."</strong><br><br>I would say that with the CFTs installed on our Vipers, we could sustain combat operations with aerial refuelling support by our KC-135s up to the Indian Ocean or beyond the Spratlys.Sounds suitable for night maritime interdiction and air defence umbrella.The Viper is capable of fast altitude penetration with full external load while not compromising on its stabilty.SEAD and anti-ship strike missions anyone?If the Blk52+ Vipers are configured for SEAD and bombardment missions, we could have a interceptor oriented, multi role for the NGF role, meaning the Rafale would be ruled out, leaving the Typhoon and the F-15 Eagle.</div>
