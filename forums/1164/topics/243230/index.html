Look at the below image, the Chinese J11B features a Holographic HUD, you can find same type of system in f22 as well, and you also can compare the J11BÂ’s c-ockpit to that of original Su27SK in 1990s.<br><br><img src="http://img357.imageshack.us/img357/5342/j11rz2.jpg"><br><br><img src="http://i7.tinypic.com/43cum1z.jpg"><br><br>Below is J11B image released from Chinese media, quite a mighty Flanker<br><br><img src="http://i10.tinypic.com/30jjhxz.jpg"><br><br>More detailed reads on Chinese indigenous Flanker, the J11B, from AWST:<br><br><a href="http://www.aviationweek.com/aw/generic/story_generic.jsp?channel=awst&amp;id=news/aw110606p2.xml" rel="nofollow"><strong>Chinese J-11B Presages Quiet Military Revolution</strong></a><br><br><blockquote> <span style="color: blue;">...The nationally developed systems now in various stages of the J-11B test program potentially provide performance improvements over the various Su-27 models now in PLAAF service.<br>Air Show China, held here Oct. 31-Nov. 5, included the first official detail about the Shenyang Tai Hang engine. This turbofan powerplant is being developed for the Flanker, and is also sometimes referred to as the WS-10A. A handful of J-11B airframes are now likely being used for development testing, including at least one J-11B engine-integration aircraft.<br>Beijing and Moscow first agreed on the Flanker sale in 1991, with a license production contract signed in 1996. The Flanker has given China its most capable fighter aircraft while also providing a vehicle for its industry to gain knowledge of fourth-generation fighter manufacturing. The first kit-built J-11A was completed in 1998. The J-11A still uses Russian engines, radar and weaponry.<br>Design and development of the Tai Hang has been underway for nearly two decades, says one senior Chinese aero-engine executive. He admits the program has proved challenging: "We hit difficulties in developing the engine."<br>Chinese industry executives attending the show remain reticent to discuss the J-11B program. The executive would say only that the Tai Hang has "similar applications to the Al-31 [the present Su-27 engine]. It's of a similar thrust and is of the same technology generation." The J-11B program also includes the integration of Chinese-developed planar array pulse-Doppler radar replacing the Russian N-001 cassegrain radar, at least two versions of which are fielded by the PLAAF. An image of a J-11B, still in its primer (see top photo on p. 27), appears to show the aircraft fitted with a different radome to the basic Su-27. Given the available space for a flat-plate antenna, this would offer a performance improvement over the N-0001.<br>Also associated with the J-11B is the Luoyang PL-12 active radar-guided medium-range air-to-air missile. While the Chinese air force already has the Russian R-77 (AA-12 Adder) in service with the Su-27, the PL-12 offers a big performance increase over the present export standard of the Vympel R-77. Officials from the company were unable to discuss the PL-12 project.<br>The initial development test-firing program for the overall PL-12 program now appears complete, with the missile at least close to service entry. It was integrated first on the J-8II for the development program. Trials of the PL-12 on the Chengdu J-10 also have been carried out.<br>The PL-12 does benefit from Russian technology, with the seeker and inertial guidance system provided by Moscow. A variant of the Agat 9B-1103M radar seeker is the most likely candidate for the missile. This seeker was intended initially for an improved version of the R-77, but appears to have been sold to China first.<br>The PLAAF currently has the capability for two-target engagement using the Su-27, R-77 combination. Successful integration of the PL-12 on the J-11B would likely provide a genuine multitarget capability and give the PLAAF a more capable air superiority aircraft...</span> </blockquote></div>

Unless France is going to withdraw from EU. The embargo will block it even PRC wants to buy it.....<br><br>PRC will be more happy to buy additional 210 J-10 for itself rather than Mirage 2000-9.
