            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by Gedanken:</div><div class="quote_body">Just as well that thread was closed - it went south right quick.  In an effort to preserve some minimal level of discourse on the forum, I'd just like to throw my two cents' worth in.<br><br>It is an interesting article, but it is ultimately far from conclusive.  I am only going to deal with the initial post - the arguments in subsequent posts only taint the analysis.<br><br>Amongst the issues I have with the way the article was written:<br><br>1) A lot of statements are introduced which are phrased as a matter of fact.  However, sources of such information are reported as "lost" or "unknown".  Without sources that can be cited and independently examined, the assertions cannot be taken as the basis of any conclusions, and that pretty much eliminates about a quarter of the article.<br><br>2) With ancient scripts, the often poetic style of writing allows for a wide degree of artistic licence, both in the writing and interpretation.  This, of course, is not limited to Indian scripts; other writings such as the Bible are subject to misinterpretation.  A classic case would be Revelations, in which the description of giant dragonflies with the heads of men has been tenuously extrapolated to be a description of a helicopter.  Given that the data from the ancient sanskrit documents has not been known to have been translated into any current applications, we may conclude that the documents are either too vague, incomplete or just plain wrong.  That eliminates most of the rest of the article.<br><br>3) Most of the article deals with reporting only the "what"; the "why" and "how" are at best only lightly touched upon, and when they are, vague concepts such as "the unknown power of the ego existing in man's physiological makeup" are used.  Lacking the presence of factual proof, at least some logical thread incorporating, at the very liberally least, "what" and "how" is required if some logical integrity is to be maintained in the article.  Unfortunately, this requirement has not been met either.<br><br>Given the use of the word "proof" in the title, MunnaBhai, the burden of proof rests upon you.  This article in itself may be enough to get a discussion started, but is far from conclusive enough for you to expect to convince anyone of anything.<br><br>At the very least, if you're hoping to convince anyone of your assertions, some factual evidence must be presented.  For example, are there any research articles reporting the radiation levels found in Mohenjodaro?  Given that the radiation from nuclear weapons at Hiroshima and Nagasaki have already subsided substantially, there must be a fair amount of radiaactive material left in Mohenjodaro - has such material been collected and studied?  Of course, the data needs to come from an institution which allows all of its research to be verified by an independent body.<br><br>Bottom line is, I'd love to believe you, and presented with the right materials, I actually might.</div></blockquote>Did u read the articles and the subsequent ones i posted in that thread....Open yr eyes and see ..the things that u ask for are there..the article is definetly one of integrity of not the researchers wont be wasting time on it<br><br>The one about the rajastan site has already been proven to be radioactive...where di this radiation come from? or did US dropped A-bomb there during WW2?  Do u in fact know what u are talking about?....The fact that research already  has shown that the radiation there is around 8000-12000 years old......That independent bodies u were talking about  who are Us scientists are already doing that research together with the indian scientists....I guess u guys need a crash course on how to read articles....</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Radiation still so intense, the area is highly dangerous.<br><br>A heavy layer of radioactive ash in Rajasthan, India, covers a three-square mile area, ten miles west of Jodhpur. Scientists are investigating the site, where a housing development was being built.<br><br>For some time it has been established that there is a very high rate of birth defects and cancer in the area under construction. The levels of radiation there have registered so high on investigators' gauges that the Indian government has now cordoned off the region. Scientists have unearthed an ancient city where evidence shows an atomic blast dating back thousands of years, from 8,000 to 12,000 years, destroyed most of the buildings and probably a half-million people. One researcher estimates that the nuclear bomb used was about the size of the ones dropped on Japan in 1945.<br><br>The Mahabharata clearly describes a catastrophic blast that rocked the continent. "A single projectile charged with all the power in the Universe...An incandescent column of smoke and flame as bright as 10,000 suns, rose in all its splendor...it was an unknown weapon, an iron thunderbolt, a gigantic messenger of death which reduced to ashes an entire race.<br><br>"The corpses were so burned as to be unrecognizable. Their hair and nails fell out, pottery broke without any apparent cause, and the birds turned white.<br><br>"After a few hours, all foodstuffs were infected. To escape from this fire, the soldiers threw themselves into the river."<br><br>A HISTORIAN COMMENTS<br><br>Historian Kisari Mohan Ganguli says that Indian sacred writings are full of such descriptions, which sound like an atomic blast as experienced in Hiroshima and Nagasaki. He says references mention fighting sky chariots and final weapons. An ancient battle is described in the Drona Parva, a section of the Mahabharata. "The passage tells of combat where explosions of final weapons decimate entire armies, causing crowds of warriors with steeds and elephants and weapons to be carried away as if they were dry leaves of trees," says Ganguli.<br><br>"Instead of mushroom clouds, the writer describes a perpendicular explosion with its billowing smoke clouds as consecutive openings of giant parasols. There are comments about the contamination of food and people's hair falling out."<br><br>ARCHEOLOGICAL INVESTIGATION PROVIDES INFORMATION<br><br>Archeologist Francis Taylor says that etchings in some nearby temples he has managed to translate suggest that they prayed to be spared from the great light that was coming to lay ruin to the city. "It's so mid-boggling to imagine that some civilization had nuclear technology before we did. The radioactive ash adds credibility to the ancient Indian records that describe atomic warfare."<br><br>Construction has halted while the five member team conducts the investigation. The foreman of the project is Lee Hundley, who pioneered the investigation after the high level of radiation was discovered.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Giant Unexplained Crater Near Bombay<br><br>Another curious sign of an ancient nuclear war in India is a giant crater near Bombay. The nearly circular 2,154-metre-diameter Lonar crater, located 400 kilometres northeast of Bombay and aged at less than 50,000 years old, could be related to nuclear warfare of antiquity.<br><br>No trace of any meteoric material, etc., has been found at the site or in the vicinity, and this is the world's only known "impact" crater in basalt. Indications of great shock (from a pressure exceeding 600,000 atmospheres) and intense, abrupt heat (indicated by basalt glass spherules) can be ascertained from the site.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>RAMA EMPIRE OF INDIA<br><br>Writer  : David Hatcher Childress<br>Source : Atlantis Rising<br><br>Fortunately, the ancient books of India's Rama Empire have been preserved, unlike those of China, Egypt, Central America, Peru. Many of these ancient nations are now either desert wastelands, swallowed by thick jungle or literally at the bottom of some ocean. Yet India, despite devastation by wars and invasion, managed to maintain a large part of its ancient history.<br><br>For a long time, Indian civilization was not believed to date from much earlier than about 500 B.C., only about 200 years prior to Alexander the Great's invasion of the subcontinent. In the past century, however, the extremely sophisticated cities of Mohenjo Daro (Mound of the Dead) and Harappa have been discovered in the Indus Valley of modern-day Pakistan.<br><br>The discoveries of these cities forced archaeologists to push the dates for the origin of Indian civilization back thousands of years. A wonder to modern-day researchers, the cities were highly developed and caused leading archaeologists to believe that they were conceived as a whole before they were built: a remarkable early example of city planning. Even more remarkable is that the plumbing-sewage system throughout the large city is superior to that found in Pakistan, India, and most Asian countries today.</div>
