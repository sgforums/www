            <div class='col-md body'>Watched it for the first time yesterday though it was released two years ago...<br>Spotted a number of 'errors'<br><br>Cuba Gooding did not "lead" the target when he was shooting at the aircraft i.e he did not aim and shoot in front of the aircraft while it flew past,instead he aimed directly at it when it was flying past,like that in real war confirm miss 1 la! But surprisely,he got the kill!<br><br>The destroyers at Pearl Harbor were Spruance-class DDs commissioned in the 1970s! They have a lot of WW2 FRAM type destroyers now used as memorials what ,why can't they use those instead for the sake of historical accuracy?<br><br>The damage inflicted on Tokyo by the Doolittle Raiders were not as great as depicted on the show.The movie shows so many explosions-as if a lot of damage done.In reality,most of the Doolittle Raiders' bombs missed...<br><br>Will watch it again to spot more inaccuracies. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>That sorry excuse for a war movie is full of crap. Riddled with technical and historical inaccuracies. Whats worse is the puke-worthy romance and over-the-top American nationalism. I can understand a little artistic and dramatic license, but they were practically re-writing history. *Puke*<br><br>Give me Band of Brothers, Saving Private Ryan or even Tora Tora Tora anytime</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>the makers of the movie had said that this is not an actual depiction of the history.... neither are they interested to rewrite the history. even they have conceded that some the story line is fictious. on top of what the mistakes you people have spotted, i would like to point out the scene whereby the navy cross where awarded. according to history, it was ADM chester nitmitz who pinned the navy cross. the scene from pearl harbour depicted a Captain....... wa lau eh..... they actually demoted nimitz or what????? the most bulls*it shot is where the zeros fly between the battleships...... MGs from the battleships were shooting at each other!!!!!!!! KNN...hollywood use your brains leh.....think that we are all 3 yrs old kids...<br><br>anyway, degress a little bit here....... i have a soft spot for tora! tora! tora!, battle of midway, a bridge too far, battle of britain and most recently we were soldiers.........</div>

That was actually a scene gone wrong, the plane had really crashed when it was not supposed to, the cameras were rolling and the panic on the actors was real panic. The producers looked at the scene, liked it so much and kept it as part of the movie</div>
