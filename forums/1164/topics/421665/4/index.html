              <p>Clearly the SAF needs to use simpler words
              to explain how ACMS works. I tot its already simple
              enough but I'll make an attempt.</p>
              <p>Built-in GPS = auto-knowledge of friendly force location.</p>
              <p>Communications pad = push 1 button to send message "need

              <p>Camera = point and relay image.</p>
              <p>Seems goondu proof to me. No need to explain what is the
              problem, just show. No need to say where one is, computer already
              show. No need explain whether under-fire, just push button. Don't
              even need to read map. Digital map show where you are and where you
              need to go. I don't know about wayang but all those items
              seem pretty relevant to me.</p>
              <p>I remember a time when we didn't even have 732s in a section so
              how to communicate? Then we had a counter where we had to click to
              count footsteps so one doesn't get lost. And then map-reading in
              tall lallang. lol. Clearly someone either isn't in
              infantry and has never gone thru BMT.</p>

              <p>ACMS has absolutely nothing to do with rifle sight. I think
              99.999% of SAF still point their weapons in the right direction. If
              one is blind, the camera will still capture the images.</p>
              <p>One may have the best rifle sight in the world but if you're not
              where you're supposed to be, all the best rifle sights in the world
              are useless. If you don't know where you are, can't call for help,
              can't identify the enemy, then all the best rifle sights in the
              world = useless. I can certainly understand why there is the
              ACMS.</p>

              <p>You are taking this way too far. If this ACMS system removes the need to shoot accurately/at night, maybe you want to issue PDWs or pistols instead. It's not like your fire support assets are always available.</p>
              <p>Anyway you didn't address how reflex sights and/or night sights are not useful if we have ACMS.</p>

              <p>Think both of you are a bit on different topics, weasel's on the usefulness of ACMS while you were on usefulness of better sights, hence a bit of crossed wires.</p>
              <p>I for one would NEVER avocate replacing small arms with a ACMS set, not would I replace my NVBs for one. These items are supposed to be used in combination, not solo. We're an army, not the Lone Ranger. This applies to our equipment too. TI-NVB-Laser pointer. Spotter-Localiser-Aimer. All have their jobs.</p>
              <p>ACMS? When you have more targets than ammo or common sense. :P</p>

              <p><br>Didn't say reflex sights and/or night sights are not useful. No one is advocating no small arms. The question which has been repeated is what is the incremental benefit over existing sights.</p>
              <p>I do think night/reflex sights are recon tools. SAR-21 already has optical sights. The SAR-21A can be equipped with better sights. No doubt.</p>
              <p>But that has zero bearing on the effectiveness of the ACMS. ACMS is a big value add. No fire support, keep out of range of an enemy who can shoot you at longer range and I'm not talking about just rifle sights. Common sense.</p>
              <p>An M-16 with an ACMS and good fire support is far more valuable than a sharpshooters rifle with no situation awareness. Of course a sharpshooter with an ACMS and good fire support is better than an M-16 with an ACMS and good fire support. But is it worth converting the entire SAF to sharpshooter + night scopes? Maybe not.</p>

              <p>Why not worth?</p>
              <p>Soldiers cannot choose not to fight at night or in scenarios requiring quick aiming. If it keeps soldiers out of hospital or the morgue, it's logistically and morally worthwhile. It's not a cool "recon tool", every soldier can benefit from one.</p>
              <p>I see it not as a question of worth, but as an obligation.</p>
              <p>As to ACMS, it's built around the basic SAR-21 for 5 out of 7 soldiers. I asked an officer involved during my NS when I was fortuitiously posted there for a few days. Seeing how infantry battalions were converted to SAR-21 as recently as 2006, it's easy to see it remaining for a long time to come.</p>

              <p>alize, the "worth" part is not all or nothing, we already have systems in place for what the OP wanted, so if it was not implimented, it's not like we totally lose the capability, we still have it, abet in a lesser form.</p>
              <p>And it still begs the question of is the added % capability worth all the money that would be spent on it?</p>
              <p>An analogy would be like your boss asking you to work 1hr extra OT everyday, and at the end of the month, he'll pay you $30 extra. Does that mean you can't use an extra $30? No, but OTing for $1/hr might not really be worth it. Same like the sights, we could ALWAYS do with greater accuracy, but is what we're going to pay for it really worth it? (Yay, more taxes... right...), especially when the chances of us using the capabilities to the max is very limited (closed terrain, few 800m shots)?.</p>

              <p>No more hiding behind someone with a 12 gauge shotgun unless you want a shotgun wedding. Be on the side armed with the  5.56   or  7.62 or   .338 ,  50 cal or 40 mm weapon -  especially the ones with the optical sights </p>
              <p>On the other hand  I will be very wary if the shotgun was equipped with a red dot sight  - I wud not want to be blasted with buckshot at 30 m  - note :-  I did not say 300 m.  </p>

              <p>And it still begs the question of is the added % capability worth all the money that would be spent on it?</p>
              <p>An analogy would be like your boss asking you to work 1hr extra OT everyday, and at the end of the month, he'll pay you $30 extra. Does that mean you can't use an extra $30? No, but OTing for $1/hr might not really be worth it. Same like the sights, we could ALWAYS do with greater accuracy, but is what we're going to pay for it really worth it? (Yay, more taxes... right...), especially when the chances of us using the capabilities to the max is very limited (closed terrain, few 800m shots)?.</p>

              <p>And I'm on the side with the HIMAR and F-16 strikes. Literally. They taught little ol' Sepa kitty how to call in an airstrike yet? Or do they still not trust you with sharp objects?</p>

              <p>Didn't say reflex sights and/or night sights are not useful. No one is advocating no small arms. The question which has been repeated is what is the incremental benefit over existing sights.</p>
              <p><strong><em>It has also been repeated over and over that they offer a SIGNIFICANT step change in capability. I back this up with the fact that the US Army alone uses more than 500,000 of these sights. Many other modern armies now have these sights as standard. Hey these sights are not exactly new. They have been around for more than 30 years and the SAF has not caught up !!! </em></strong></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I do think night/reflex sights are recon tools. SAR-21 already has optical sights. The SAR-21A can be equipped with better sights. No doubt.</p>
              <p><strong><em>No one said that these sights are meant for recon. Most like the Aimpoints or EO Tech sights are 1X mag. The 4 to 6X ones will help you to identify targets at longer ranges. They are primarily weapons sights.</em></strong></p>
              <p>But that has zero bearing on the effectiveness of the ACMS. ACMS is a big value add. No fire support, keep out of range of an enemy who can shoot you at longer range and I'm not talking about just rifle sights. Common sense.</p>
              <p><strong><em>Common sense is to get modern sights on the small arms first , then move to AMCS. Like I said , the SAF got it backwards</em></strong>.</p>
              <p>An M-16 with an ACMS and good fire support is far more valuable than a sharpshooters rifle with no situation awareness. Of course a sharpshooter with an ACMS and good fire support is better than an M-16 with an ACMS and good fire support. But is it worth converting the entire SAF to sharpshooter + night scopes? Maybe not.</p>
              <p><strong><em>Situational awareness for the rifleman is Mk1 eyeball and good ears. There are severe limitations to UAVs and the like. All can be countered.</em></strong></p>
              <p><em>I repeat again, I am all for killing the enemy at long distance. But I am talking about the infantryman. After the enemy MBTs, arty  units and battalion HQs are wiped out  by F15SGs, HIMARS etc ,  the rifleman- and that you - you need to take and defend the ground.  There will still be enemy soldiers to take out in the jungles , trenches,  bunkers, buildings etc. This is the realm of the infantryman. So better be equipped with the best possible equipment. Even in the most modern battlefield, there will be section , platoon and also brutal hand to hand combat. </em></p>
              <p><em>The lessons of history all bear this out.</em></p>
              <p><em>In WW2  the allies for a time thought that they cud win the war by  strategic bombing only. This is  totally incorrect. In the end you msut take the ground and only the infantry can do that .Only then will you have victory.</em></p>
              <p><em></em></p>

We do not wish to be in this type of situation in the first place if we can help it. <span> </span>But we need not start from scratch – no need to reinvent the wheel.</span></strong></p>

              <p>I once saw a "10 top PDWs" ranking comparing the G36K, HK416 and an unfolding-stock-and-frame built around a Glock pistol, clearly not an apples to apples comparison.</p>
              <p>There will always be a need for reflex sights and networked soldiers in different situations. But I think there will be little need for ill-balanced weapons and red laser pointers for some time. We are stuck with it, however, since a rifle is not a war winning thing. It only makes a difference to the guy holding it. When you get your ACMS, best you click on every single structure you see before it fails. Then you don't have to duck around any walls.</p>
