              <p>Sorry that you are Underpaid but so am I. </p>
              <p>Have a mini red dot sight on top of the 6X scope as do the British and US Armies. Better still get an Elcan with variable 2.5 to 6X  sight.</p>
              <p>Please be more professional  -  zero a 3X or more scoped weapon at 100 m and not at  25 m.   I hope that our Leo2s do not also try to zero their 120s at  25 m.</p>
              <p>Did you not learn to aim your fire at the enemy muzzle flashes in night fighting ?  Do you also learn not to smoke or turn on your flashlight in the night ?  I believe a visible laser puts out a much better light than all the above. </p>
              <p>WRT calling on an F16,   I rather be deaf than dead.</p>

              <p>Hi Spencer,</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Just for you to note that these wonder sights make a good shooter better.</p>
              <p>They shoot faster , make multiple hits per target and to top it off, they can do it at longer ranges too.   Iron sights are no match to the low mag variety of these sights in terms of speed &amp; accuracy at short ranges.  For long ranges, iron sights are of course no comparison to the scoped &amp; mag sights. With the variable power sights, you get best of two worlds. </p>
              <p>But of course one must apply all the fundamentals of shooting be it iron sights or not. As I said  a good shooter becomes deadlier with these sights while a poor shooter just remains a target board even with an ACOG, Elcan or Aimpoint  on his weapon.  </p>

              <p><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black;">Hi ahtansh,</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black;"> </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black;">The full power and might of the SAF will be called upon only as a last resort  if &amp; when the survival  or existence of tiny  Singapore is threatened by an enemy - whoever it might be.  In the meantime we do live in a <span> </span>boring neighborhood - <span> </span>although we all like it that way. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black;">The probability of total outright war in this region <span> </span>for the foreseeable future is now low although anything can happen anytime as we live in an unpredictable world. <span> </span><span> </span></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black;">In fact the highest probability of the SAF having to employ any of its weapons, if at all,<span>  </span>will be when an installation ( military or civilian<span>  </span>) comes under <span> </span>for example a<span>  </span>terrorist attack. And the NSman armed with the SAR21, M16 or any small arm will most likely be the <span> </span><span> </span>immediate &amp;<span>  </span>probably only available resource able to thwart such an attack <span> </span>&amp;<span>  </span>not a<span>  </span>Leo2 , F16 , GMLRS , Primus……………..<span>  </span></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black;">So, on the contrary, the SAF’s<span>  </span><span>  </span>“lowly“ <span> </span>rifle as opposed to its other <span> </span>hi tech arsenal is a <strong><em><span style="text-decoration: underline;">very high priority</span></em></strong> weapon for modernization and improvement. <span> </span>The SAF must immediately ensure that the NSman has the best available small arm tools so that threats in a higher probability scenario such as a terrorist attack can be quickly &amp; effectively neutralized when the time comes. <span> </span></span></p>

              <p>There are more than enough snipers to deal with a terrorist attack and the last thing we want to do is to have untrained sniper wannabes tackling terrorists and shooting civilians. That's no justification for an incrementally top-rate sight.</p>
              <p>Having said that, a good pair of binos is a worthwhile investment.</p>
              <p>As an incentive, the Govt might want to give a tax deduction for anyone who buys a dual use item eg bino etc from a govt approved vendor. That will save taxes and encourage greater civil participation and ownership. That could be in a future budget wishlist.</p>

              <p>6 posts in 2 hours, I suspect bias. :)</p>
              <p>Be more professional.</p>
              <p>In case you don't get it Sepa, all the wondersights you propose have serious weaknesses in aquiring the target 50m and below due to overmagnification, hence the zeroing comment, and frankly, I'm more likely to encounter a hostile 100M and below rather than 600m+ considering our operating terrain.</p>
              <p>And you obviously never used a laser targetter if you say it puts out more peripheral vislight radiation than an L-torch or a ciggy. And if you did... I suggest a refresher course.</p>
              <p>I already pointed out that that item was not supposed to be used independently, but in combination with a NVG/NVM to get both an illuminated target and an aimpoint as opposed to only illuminated sights and a near invisible target. A co-dependence that will be broken up by your suggestion (or rant).</p>
              <p>I'm still more in favour of shotgun's suggestion of more hands on training, and weasel's mechanization ideas than getting long range sights for closed terrain fighting. Wonder if the Terrax can be fitted with a SRAM or the new US "Common Launcher" for better fire support.</p>

              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Arial;">I did not know SAF had snipers guarding all key installations – that will be great ! <span> </span><span> </span></span></p>

              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"> </p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Arial;">But then is’nt the normal rifleman <span> </span>not up to the mark to take out a terrorist and therefore a sniper is required <span> </span>?<span>    So you doubt  the probablity of our riflemen hitting  an intruder at a key installation when using a SAR21.  </span></span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Arial;"> </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Arial;">As I have already stated repeatedly , a marksman is not a sniper. Neither is an infantryman. But<span>  </span>if normal riflemen can hit man sized targets 100 % of the time at 50 m <span> </span>200 m and up to 300 m<span>  </span>and markmen <span> </span>can do so up to 400 to 600 m, then elite snipers will be needed only for up to 800 m or more. </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Arial;"> </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Arial;">If you not need top of the line equipment to give you<span>  </span>the war winning edge, <span> </span>then there is also no justification for a top rate tank , top rate fighter, top rate </span></p>

              <p>Isn't your proposal to have everyone operating top end scopes for rifles? Wouldn't that make everyone a sniper?</p>
              <p>My wanting binos is not to fire the rifle. Useful for plane watching. </p>

No commission or vested interest except for a desire for a good pair of binos. If you don't want one, I would rather not be selfish and condemn a suggestion out of spite.</p>

              <p>Top end modern sights need not be of the large mag type. I repeat ,  even 1X  modern sights make riflemen very much more deadly at 0 to 300 m, but even more so at the shorter ranges say 50 m.</p>
              <p>Depending on the sniper rifle calibre, they can go up to 25X when using a .338 Lapua Magnum or 0.5 inch ( for the Barret ).</p>

              <p>Does Sepe call everyone spencer or did he get mixed up with someone else?</p>
              <p>On training, YES! I think our hands on time with our weapons is woefully inadequate, once a year range is totally insufficient to gain proficiency in our firearms, not to mention loading 4 rounds per mag only does NOT in any way or form get us used to the handling/ergronomics of a fully loaded rifle. This is even worse for the heavy weapons people, not in terms of range time, but also in terms of understanding their weapon. Can a Law/Matador kill a light tank? APC? How deep is the practical penetration in that case? Enough to kill a MBT? Or the 0.5 GPMG? Problem is that the users really don't know what their weapon can do, over or underestimating their capabilities.</p>
              <p>As for the laser part, you were the one who claimed the laser put out more radiation than a torch or cigrette and highly detectable, which is only partially true. It does give out more radiation, but on a highly narrow front as compared to the wide span emitting radiation (the "peripherial" emission that you can't seem to get) of a torch or a cigrette, and is actually less detectable provided you're not standing directly in front of it. And if you are... you do realise you're standing in the flightpath of a 5.56? :)</p>
              <p>As for the NVG question... let's just say it's like the bullet-proof vest question and leave it at that.</p>
              <p>If I had to engage the enemy, I'd be in serious shit. You do realise most armies field much larger squads than us? A US squad outnumbers my team 2:1, and this is not comparing the Soviet 10 man system. You go do your small arms fire, I'll stick with indirect fire support. After all, if you got it, why not use it? You TAG trained?</p>
              <p>Back to the original sights question (rant)</p>
              <p>You were comparing NATO strategic doctrine vs Singaporean strategic doctrine, which differ slightly in very important areas. When the US enters a Theatre, they'll try to secure large amounts of rear areas to build bases and firebases for support while the vanguard pushes forward to create defensive depth. This is similar to the Singaporean model only in the 2nd part, Singapore does not have the ability to set up large support bases in hostile territory or to guard them securely without the risk of being overrun in detail by superior numbers. In fact, the Singaporean model is more like raiding than an actual invasion, which also means support is limitted for things like optics repair (Murphy's Law, they WILL break sooner or later), or long term battery powered optics.</p>
              <p>Personnel wise, European armies are professional full time soldiers as compared to our conscripts. Our "Air" level guys might be able to handle complicated optics, but we also have a core of "hokkian beng"... oh sorry, "peng". :P I forsee carnage when they get THEIR hands on your pretty little optics.</p>
              <p>Equipment wise, I already mentioned the interplay between our equipment, so I won't belabour it again.</p>
              <p>Terrain likewise, mentioned too.</p>
              <p>So in 4 fields, strategy, personel, equipment dependencies and terrain, new sights only offer marginal improvements in some areas but also some risks in others, so I'll still say no.</p>
              <p>You remind me of an old saying. "If you have a hammer, all problems start looking like nails." You obviously have an optical sight. All your problems start looking like range problems.</p>
              <p>Has ANYONE agreed with you since you started the tread?</p>

              <p>Ditzy , there is a difference in being able to see  and  being able to hit a target be it at 50 or 300 m in the dark, low light or in broad daylight. </p>
              <p>And thank goodness that you can see something at 50 m at night. But I suppose that it is not a pitch black night, unless you have night vision.</p>

              <p>An impression appears to be that existing SAF rifles including older generation ones cannot perform under 300m or in low-light/night conditions. This is patently false as anyone who has gone through NS would know. I think people should refocus back to the justification for the <span style="text-decoration: underline;">incremental</span> benefits of a next-gen sight beyond 300m.</p>
              <p>I think "Underpaid" made a good point about squad size. To add, it filters up in effect as one goes into platoon, company, battalion, brigade and division. The smaller number of shooters is magnified at division level.</p>
              <p>It is rather similar to the Israeli context when they tackled far larger Arab formations. I would however highlight that Israeli force multipliers relied not just on indirect weapons capability but also direct weaponry eg MBTs. In desert storm, the Abrams were using the 12.7s to whack individual targets at far more significant ranges compared to small arms fire. Having said that, equipment like mortars was far more important in ensuring Israeli victory than small arms. Again, more SRAMs would make a greater difference.</p>
              <p>That would suggest that sights should be improved at company level rather than squad eg GPMG, 12.7s or AGLs. ACSW is an interesting option but that would mean switching to 25mm from existing 40mm grenades. Ultimately, its a question of balance.</p>

              <p>I'm not convinced that the latest sights improve effectiveness as much as claimed compared to existing, and far less below 300m where targets are already within normal visual range.</p>
              <p>As mentioned in my first post on this thread, I think good gun sights serve as recon tools as well. This is generally not needed below 300m and a good pair of binos can easily replicate this capability beyond 300m.</p>
              <p>The suggestion for better sights is certainly far better than your earlier raam suggestion. But in the context of the SAF, they do not replace everything just like that. Even AR-15s are still in service and its replacement is still performed incrementally.</p>
              <p>I think if the SAF were to think the previous optical sights were sufficient, they would not have shifted production to the full length picatinny rail SAR-21A. The rail would allow for integration of other sights. In this regard, my guess is that the SAF would leverage on better sights eventually. It make sense to use the latest sights for later production models as they become available, subject to suitability. However, I doubt if this will extend into a retrofit.</p>

              <p>Weasel, think the refit of P-Rails was not a slight against the sights but to actually bring the SAR21 more in line with international standards and add a greater degree of flexibility to the configuring.

              <p><br>Agreed. Same as SAR-21 replacing M-16 is not a slight against the M-16. Its just older tech.</p>
              <p>Some of the features of the SAR-21A does address complaints about ergonomics of the earlier SAR-21.</p>
              <p>I like the ACMS concept which practically means that anyone holding the ACMS modules can become a forward observer (FO). The main weapon supporting CAS will still be arty + helo hellfires. A/c bombs + himars still need quite a bit of safety distance though that can change with new batches of bombs.</p>
              <p>That's why theres a trend toward smaller bombs eg SDB. With less collateral damage, bombs can be targeted closer to forward lines. Until then, SRAMs, other mortars, AGLs + M203s with the far smaller blast is still necessary indirect fire support weapons.</p>
