              <p>Yeah yeah Mr walking advert. Answer me this. What's the functional difference between the Trijicon system you are so gaga about, and the SAR's optical sight? Answer: They are the bloody same thing, just that you used one in the commercial world and went gaga over it had more bells and whistles while the army one is more "plain jane". They end up giving the same capabilities sans the night illumination, which is the LAD's job.</p>

              <p>About the NVGs, you asked if everyone is going to have one. Answer: Yes, in theory. Like the Kevlar vests that are supposed to be war issue. In theory. I'd love to see how good their distribution system really is if the button is pushed though.</p>
              <p>And quit whining that the SAF doesn't train like it fights, that's obviously the case, 100 round mags-not issued, Kevlar-not issued, range 4 rounds per mag vs 30 rounds per mag warload, exercises without the full ammo load (180 rounds weigh a fair bit on a LBV), NVGs-only some units, laser targetter (TAG one, not the piddly SAR one)-not even in exercises. You still say we train with a war loadout? Which dreamland unit were you from?</p>

Answer me this. What's the functional difference between the Trijicon system you are so gaga about, and the SAR's optical sight? Answer: They are the bloody same thing, just that you used one in the commercial world and went gaga over it had more bells and whistles while the army one is more "plain jane". They end up giving the same capabilities sans the night illumination, which is the LAD's job.</span></span></p>

              <p>I call bullshit on the classified unit nonsense. You obviously have no idea what RSTA unit is do you, or you would never have pulled the "I'm classified" bullshit. Go wiki it. If I can put it here, there are VERY little units more "classified", even the LURPS I know identify themselves as such. Only more classified units that come to mind immediately are some of the SOF and the STAR. And I doubt you are either. You really never were in a unit before were you? Unless it's a NCC wannabe.</p>

This is generally not needed below 300m and a good pair of binos can easily replicate this capability beyond 300m.</span></span></p>
              <p style="margin-left: 72pt;"><strong><span lang="EN-US"><span style="font-size: small;">Indeed you will need not only binos to look at details BELOW 300 m but more so<span>  </span>thermal imaging equipment for battlefield and night scenarios. </span></span></strong></p>
              <p style="margin-left: 72pt;"><strong><span lang="EN-US"><span style="font-size: small;">Snipers use spotting scopes of up to 40X and they are looking out for targets up to 800 m. </span></span></strong></p>
              <p style="margin-left: 72pt;"><strong><span lang="EN-US"><span style="font-size: small;">Mark1 eyeball cannot spot details at 300 m unless endowed with eagle eyesight. So you need binos to spot details. But a 4 to 6X scope will help &amp; you will not need to carry add binos. </span></span></strong></p>
              <p style="margin-left: 72pt;"><span lang="EN-US"><span style="font-size: small;">The suggestion for better sights is certainly far better than your earlier raam suggestion. But in the context of the SAF, they do not replace everything just like that. Even AR-15s are still in service and its replacement is still performed incrementally.</span></span></p>
              <p style="margin-left: 72pt;"><strong><span lang="EN-US"><span style="font-size: small;">In fact they do <span> </span><span> </span>eg A4s replaced with F15SGs. </span></span></strong></p>
              <p style="margin-left: 72pt;"><span lang="EN-US"><span style="font-size: small;">I think if the SAF were to think the previous optical sights were sufficient, they would not have shifted production to the full length picatinny rail SAR-21A. The rail would allow for integration of other sights. In this regard, my guess is that the SAF would leverage on better sights eventually. It make sense to use the latest sights for later production models as they become available, subject to suitability. However, I doubt if this will extend into a retrofit</span></span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt 72pt;"><strong><span lang="EN-US"><span style="font-size: small;">My point exactly. Clearly SAF realizes that SAR21 sight is less </span></span></strong><strong><span lang="EN-US"><span style="font-size: small;">than sufficient &amp; that’s why SAR21A <span> </span>will come with P rails &amp; I suspect sights akin to the ACOGs, Aimpoints, Elcans. </span></span></strong></p>

              <p>SAR-21 was build with with objective - cheap, good and effective !!!  It is basically a rojak rifle - trying to copy from different rifles. Of course rojak end up over doing it - which lead to extra weight.</p>
              <p>Even at that time - most modern western armies also cannot affort fancy sights like ACOGs or aimpoints.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>As for the sight - I would not say it is the best or the worst. Face it it is simple, effective get the job done.  I think what we got is average sight - which a lot other armies still does not have.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I think SAR-21A will see a improvement from SAR-21.</p>

              <p>Underpaid, like I said many times, your powers of comprehension are beyond rescue. To the contrary, no one has refuted the fact that these sights are very much better than the SAR21's.  And clearly neither have you. But it is no surprise coming from a monomaniac like you -  I just love to use new words - don't  you ?  </p>
              <p>Please read my posts again. I already said that, if the rules of engagement permit and it is the best solution, by all means call for an arty or air strike. I wud too.  </p>

              <p>Storywolf,</p>
              <p>In fact many of the best rifles are a result of taking the best of previous rifles and throwing out the worst. No need to reinvent the wheel.  This process is called development.</p>
              <p>At the time when SAR21  appeared, the BA already had SUSAT sights on their standard rifles for many years. </p>
              <p>The SAR21 sight cud have been much better by some simple fixes  such as an illuminated reticle. Note how simple and effective were SUSAT and even the sight on the AUG rifles of long ago.</p>

              <p>Storywolf, I am so saddened that you too are in the same league as Underpaid. And  I hope that you are also not one of the handful of monomaniacs lurking in Singapore.</p>
              <p>If you bother to read my posts, you wud have noted that I shoot very well with iron sights ;  and so do many other SAF riflemen.  </p>
              <p>And if you wud have bothered reading further, the point is that these sights make good shooters not only better but very much faster. And if the magnified variety are attached to weapons such as SAWs, GPMGs, 50 cal  etc, then well you can kiss the enemy goodbye. </p>
              <p>Of course there will always be better equipment. So shud we have stuck to AS350s with TOWs instead of AH64Ds with Hellfire, A4s  instead of F15SGs ,  laser guided bombs instead of dumb bombs etc etc ? Well the list in the SAF arsenal goes on and on.    </p>
              <p>If you personally wish to go to a fight with an average weapon in a real war, be my guest.  As for me I &amp; many others , we will  definitely take along the best weapon available. If you disagree  then you are probably a monomaniac or worse.   </p>

              <p>Wah... didn't realise the topic was this hot.  Sepecat, seriously, ease up with the personal comments. </p>
              <p>Now, the reason why some of us think that you have not gone through NS or BMT as a combatant is because you lack knowledge on the typical engagement distance of an infantryman in our neck of the woods (and heck, anywhere else too).  If you did, you would not have suggested shooting at infantry targets at 600m with 5.56mm assault rifles.  </p>
              <p>And of course there was that last sentence about you taking the "best weapon available."  You know you won't have a choice.  If the army gives you a SAR-21, you will shoot nothing but a SAR-21 unless you somehow admit to being involved illegal arms trading in Singapore.</p>
              <p>Now, no one here is against the use of ACOG or wadever scopes/sights you suggest.  The question is whether they are economically feasible as a standard issue for a conscript army thats not actively deployed. If the budget allows, who knows? But, there are other priorities that serve as better force multipliers than infantry optics.  Integrated Fire support and close air support for example.  </p>
              <p>They are more effective force multipliers for many reasons, the simplest being raw firepower.  They are have greater deterrence value compared to infantry sights.  Aggressors think twice when they look SG's army.  It is small and composed largely of conscripts, but yet have access to some of the most advanced fighting systems in the world such as a HIMARS, Apaches, JDAMs and what nots.  Infantry optics is a small part that is not difficult to rectify, like u said, they are easy to use.  Just damn expensive to sign 1206 for. </p>
              <p>Oh, btw, don't need to ask me what unit.  Honestly I also don't know and prefer if they don't tell me. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>

              <p><br>I apparently missed this. Tot I should address this with this quote from the link below.</p>
              <p><a href="http://soldiermod.com/summer-08/prog-acms.html"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #810081;">http://soldiermod.com/summer-08/prog-acms.html</span></span></a></p>
              <p>"Describing the system[acms]’s call for fire capability Lt. Col. Kong said, “We think it is very important to say ‘I see you shoot’,” allowing the section to call upon systems that aren’t held at the section level to engage specific targets they do not have the capability to engage effectively."</p>
              <p>xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx</p>
              <p>It is very clear where SAF is headed. The individual section firepower is limited, sights or otherwise. The thinking behind network capability is value-add. Seen in this context, the argument for better sights is moot. Its not urgent.</p>
              <p>Having an ACMS system allows the section to tackle aggressor troops that out-size it as well as "out-sight" it. The enemy aggressor at below company-level can at most shoot you at 600m (or 2 click with a sniper barrett under exceptional circumstances). So long as the SAF section can spot an aggressor, they can rely on 70km sniper rifles aka GMLRS/HIMARS or more. I can't see how this would be a losing battle even if I was still carrying my trusty ol' M-16 plus a 24x25 bino (eg cheap nikon travelite).</p>
              <p>On the other side, people will have to get to company-level to obtain FO access. Sensor-shooter cycle far shorter with the ACMS = shoot first. Those are by-words for the current 3G army.</p>

              <p>Clearly the SAF needs to use simpler words to explain how ACMS works. I tot its already simple enough but I'll make an attempt.</p>
              <p>Built-in GPS = auto-knowledge of friendly force location.</p>
              <p>Communications pad = push 1 button to send message "need help".</p>
              <p>Camera = point and relay image.</p>
              <p>Seems goondu proof to me. No need to explain what is the problem, just show. No need to say where one is, computer already show. No need explain whether under-fire, just push button. Don't even need to read map. Digital map show where you are and where you need to go. I don't know about wayang but all those items seem pretty relevant to me.</p>
              <p>I remember a time when we didn't even have 732s in a section so how to communicate? Then we had a counter where we had to click to count footsteps so one doesn't get lost. And then map-reading in tall lallang. lol. Clearly someone either isn't in infantry and has never gone thru BMT.</p>
              <p><a href="http://www.mindef.gov.sg/content/dam/imindef_media_library/photos/news_release/2008/sep/0018.res?direct=1">http://www.mindef.gov.sg/content/dam/imindef_media_library/photos/news_release/2008/sep/0018.res?direct=1</a></p>
              <p>ACMS has absolutely nothing to do with rifle sight. I think 99.999% of SAF still point their weapons in the right direction. If one is blind, the camera will still capture the images.</p>
              <p>One may have the best rifle sight in the world but if you're not where you're supposed to be, all the best rifle sights in the world are useless. If you don't know where you are, can't call for help, can't identify the enemy, then all the best rifle sights in the world = useless. I can certainly understand why there is the ACMS.</p>
              <p>For those who would like to know more, I would suggest reading Martin Van Creveld's book "command in war". That would really set the context for the ACMS system. For those who don't know who that person is, google. I would also recommend his "bible" on logistics. Its a must read for any war enthusiast who wants a good understanding of warfare.</p>

              <p>Actually alise, as someone who has done both shooting and fire-support before, it's actually much easier to call in arty than to shoot properly. Yes, it's that ironic. If you can read a map, you can get in decent off-grid fire support or even a directed airstrike, you just have to tell others how to do it. :lol: Shooting on the other hand, it's DIY, no help for you there, you're on your own buddy! <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/set1/tongue.png" alt="tongue.png"></p>
              <p>The biggest gripe here is not the skill of using the sights but</p>
              <p>1) the gain from a "top end sight" is miniscule compared to current sights. It doesn't matter if your 5.56 is directed by Elocan or by SAR-21 sights, if it hits, it still counts. An example would be people saying the open bolt Ultimax is less accurate than an M-16 due the different systems, but any user can tell you, the drop in accuracy is so minimal it's almost not a factor. Or people saying 40mm grenade's time of flight is too long, but in practice, that is almost never a problem. So in theory, better sights = more accuracy, but practically, the gain is so slight, it's negligible. and</p>
              <p>2) Maintainence. How many bo-chap soldiers we have in the SAF? These people are going to be slack on maintainence, they really gain nothing out of being hardworking in the SAF, unless you want to follow SEPACAT's "execute all slackers as traitors to the People!" philosophy.</p>
              <p>BTW weasel,</p>
              <p>"Clearly someone either isn't in infantry and has never gone thru BMT."</p>
              <p>This may have been a bit too far. Let us see 1st before saying things like this lest we become like a certain cad.. oh sorry, cat.</p>
