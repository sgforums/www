            <div class='col-md body'>In any case Fatum's "arguments" reek plenty of the strawman type, in which case one wonders if one should even listen to his "oh well ...

" vibe.<br><br><blockquote>Straw man<br><br>A straw man argument is an informal fallacy based on misrepresentation of an opponent's position. To "set up a straw man" or "set up a straw-man argument" is to create a position that is easy to refute, then attribute that position to the opponent. A straw-man argument can be a successful rhetorical technique (that is, it may succeed in persuading people) but it is in fact a misleading fallacy, because the opponent's <span style="color: red;"><strong>actual argument has not been refuted.</strong></span></blockquote>An example of a straw man fallacy:<br><br>Person A: I don't think children should run into the busy streets.<br>Person B: I think that it would be foolish to lock children up all day.<br><br>Person A: And how are the Flankers to attack the stealth bombers if they can't even find them?

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote>Well, one must remember, that bombers like the B-1B, are designed for high altitude strikes out of range of most anti-air weapons. Plus, the B-2s are stealthy for the purpose of deep penetration strikes. </blockquote>No doubt b-1B is a good bomber but itÂ’s not used in such a way, PLA SAMs is able to shoot down an even higher flyer like US made U-2 as early as in 1962, Counting B-1B flying high to elude SAMs is totally out of option.  B-2 stealthy is not really Stealthy in absolute term, itÂ’s in low observation which means  itÂ’s still detectable, if not by a short wave X-band radar, it can be picked up by long wave radar like meter wave radar in a long distance.<br><br><blockquote>And remember, the US military also possesses EMP weapons... if the Chinese use it, the US is bound to... Let's not discount the fact that the Tomahawks are a proven platform with much greater range than the Silkworms. The US Navy will have to be within view of the Chinese shore for the Silkworms to be used. </blockquote>PLA already deployed its own LACM, JaneÂ’s reported such Chinese made LACM as early as in 2004, it reported then the Chinese version Tomahawks, namely DH-10, has a range of 2500 kms with the CEP less than 10 meter. And again, Silkworms are not only been launched ashore, it can be airborned. It can be launched from Submarines like type039, one of which surfaced only miles away from US A/C carriers not long ago. Besides AshM &amp; LACM, thereÂ’re TBM, Chinese just shot down one of their own satellite by using such a middle range TBM. Can a CVBG travels faster than a satellite or the main airbase of US pacific forces are not within the range of those missile?  I mean, PLA is no way to match US force in a global base, but, if US forces need to play at peopleÂ’s door side, then itÂ’s another story.<br><br><blockquote>And attack Helicopters are used together with the army... they don't go around alone.... I would like to see the infantry deal with the AFVs while they try to shoot. </blockquote>Helicopter only reins if you control the airspace plus the group SAMs are totally cleared. Chinese manufacture a whole range of man portable air-defense systems, some of which like FN-6 are even exported to the north neighbor. See the AH-64s performance in Iraq, even some RPG is able to bring it down. IÂ’ll reasonably doubt how effect those helicopters to deal with a armor force well protected by should launched or vehicle mounted missiles.<br><br><blockquote>Do note that the US Army and Navy trained to deal with the swarm tactics of the Red Army... And that the US still has plenty of nukes if it comes to it.</blockquote>You destroy enemy 1 time is no different from enemy destroy you 100 times.<br></div>

S. Lewis where rather than proving that an argument is wrong, a person instead assumes it wrong, and then goes on to explain why the other person held that argument. It is essentially a circumstantial ad hominem argument.</strong><br>Lewis wrote about this in an essay of the same name (in 1941) which is available to us in the book God in the Dock. He explains the origin of this term as follows:<br><br><span style="color: red;">You must show that a man is wrong before you start explaining why he is wrong. The modern method is to assume without discussion that he is wrong and then distract his attention from this (the only real issue) by busily explaining how he became so silly.</span><br><br>In the course of the last fifteen years I have found this vice so common that I have had to invent a name for it. I call it "Bulverism". Some day I am going to write the biography of its imaginary inventor, Ezekiel Bulver, whose destiny was determined at the age of five when he heard his mother say to his father Â— who had been maintaining that two sides of a triangle were together greater than a third Â— "Oh you say that because you are a man." "At that moment", E. Bulver assures us, "there flashed across my opening mind the great truth that refutation is no necessary part of argument. Assume that your opponent is wrong, and the world will be at your feet. Attempt to prove that he is wrong or (worse still) try to find out whether he is wrong or right, and the national dynamism of our age will thrust you to the wall." That is how Bulver became one of the makers of the Twentieth Century.</blockquote>Say all you want, but the bottom line remains beyond using a lot of " <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"> " and one-liners, you have done little to justify what you have posted here.<br><br>Until you do so, unfortunately, the onus is on you to prove it, no matter how much you may say people are armchair generals or always want to insist they are correct.<br><br><blockquote>From Bulverism by C. S. Lewis:<br><br><strong>Suppose I think, after doing my accounts, that I have a large balance at the bank. And suppose you want to find out whether this belief of mine is "wishful thinking." You can never come to any conclusion by examining my psychological condition. Your only chance of finding out is to sit down and work through the sum yourself. When you have checked my figures, then, and then only, will you know whether I have that balance or not. <span style="color: red;">If you find my arithmetic correct, then no amount of vapouring about my psychological condition can be anything but a waste of time.</span></strong> If you find my arithmetic wrong, then it may be relevant to explain psychologically how I came to be so bad at my arithmetic, and the doctrine of the concealed wish will become relevant Â— but only after you have yourself done the sum and discovered me to be wrong on purely arithmetical grounds. It is the same with all thinking and all systems of thought. <span style="color: red;"><span class="large">If you try to find out which are tainted by speculating about the wishes of the thinkers, you are merely making a fool of yourself. You must first find out on purely logical grounds which of them do, in fact, break down as arguments.</span></span> Afterwards, if you like, go on and discover the psychological causes of the error.</blockquote><strong>Until you can do that, your posts ultimately mean little no matter how funny or irrelevant you may try to make them. Calling people armchair generals or know-it-alls will not detract from their case if they are in fact, correct. </strong><br><br>And of course it calls into question the honestly of the person who attempts to distract from the crux of the issue by using circumstantial ad hominem arguments.<br><br><strong>To date you still have not justified your statement of how you realistically expect the Chinese to use EMP weapons to take out an American Carrier Battle Group.<br><br>Will you contuine to dodge the issue or face up to it?</strong></div>

This is not to mention they have a defence budget that is several times that of the next closet nation on earth. If anybody needs to catch up in Â“at what costÂ” when it comes to EMP warfare, that would be China.<br><br>EMP warfare, like you mentioned, is a good way of taking out civilian infrastructure which does not usually have the shielding military equipment has without causing the collateral damage associated with conventional bomb. Against military targets like a carrier battle ground they are significantly less, or even not effective at all. And indeed if you can hit a military ship with an E-missile you might as well do it with a real missie.<br><br>Which brings me to how your point actually flips around. In the case of both sides using EMP warfare, the Chinese have far more to lose as EMP warfare is vastly more effective on their civilian electronic infrastructure then on American military targets. In an Electronic Warfare scenario, China is far more vulnerable.<br><br>However I need to point out that the effects of EMP warfare are often vastly overrated. Actual E-bombs are often intended to create an EMP pulse as an added effect of their explosive power, as opposed to the device of fiction we often see in Goldeneye or the Â“pinchÂ” in OceanÂ’s Eleven.<br><br>It is difficult to get an EMP pulse far beyond the actual blast radius of the bomb due to the inverse square law and the simple physics- the amount of energy you can pack into an conventional package (aka. explosively pumped flux compression generator) is not usually up to the task of pumping out the kind of EMP that would be useful in overwhelming properly designed military targets (usually the blast from the weapon itself is far more destructive). Thought they would be useful versus civilian targets, but the Chinese would have to worry more about that then the Americans if push came to shove.<br></div><div class="quote_body">[quote]but if you don't understand what others are saying, or disagree with them, then you should stop behaving like a petulant little boy, and leave, cos this is a public avenue after all, and not just a venue for your mental masturbation ... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"></div></blockquote>I understand what you are saying, but I simply disagree with you for the simple reason the evidence we have on the topic seems to disagree with the picture you are painting of EMP warfare.<br><br>If you don't want to agree with, of believe me then by all means fine, but please head on down to other forums like strategy page where they have grunts trained in EW warfare and subject-matter-experts on the topic of EMP warfare and state your views.

This is the first class of US Navy warship designed with a `collective protection system for defense against the fallout associated with NBC warfare'. The ship's crew are protected by double air-locked hatches, fewer accesses to the weatherdecks and positive pressurisation of the interior of the ship to keep out contaminants. All incoming air is filtered and more reliance placed on recirculating air inside the ship. All accommodation compartments have sprinkler systems. Stealth technology includes angled surfaces and rounded edges to reduce radar signature and IR signature suppression plus Prairie Masker hull/blade rate suppression. The Ops room is below the waterline and electronics are EMP hardened. The original upright mast design has been changed to increase separation between electronic systems and the forward funnel. Differences in Flight II starting with DDG 72 include Link 16, SLQ-32(V)3 EW suite, extended-range SAM missiles and improved tactical information exchange systems. The topmast is vertical to take the SRS-1. There is also an increase in displacement caused by using more space to carry fuel.</blockquote></div>

For some reason to argue his already lost cause, Fatum sees the need to argue in vague terms that it is impossible to defend against EMP by using terms like Â“at what cost?Â” without bothering to verity them, not to mention his fantastic extrapolations for the actual effectiveness of non nuclear EMP weapons versus military targets when the intended application of these weapons were to be used against soft and Â“non hardenedÂ” targets usually found in unprotected infrastructure.<br><br>The Chinese are not so silly as to use EMP against an American Carrier battle group. In fact even the patriotic Chinese donÂ’t make such an argument in their own forum and where Fatum invented that can only be left up to the imagination.<br><br>But I must say his posts are getting funnier by the minute.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"></div>

That is your erroneous inference.
