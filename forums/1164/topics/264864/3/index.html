            <div class='col-md body'>Note this was during 1997 at a congressional hearing:<br><br><blockquote>AFFORDABLE HEMP PROTECTION<br><br>We understand how to provide effective protection against EMP effects. The basic approach is to provide a shield that prevents damaging electrical pulses from entering a system. This requires protection at all electrical and mechanical penetrations. EMP hardening protocols have been published in standard handbooks and computer programs have been developed to facilitate system hardness designs.<br><br>EMP protection is also affordable. If accomplished during the design phase, the cost of EMP protection is a small fraction, one-to-five-percent, of overall system development costs. Done after the fact, when the unprotected system has already been fielded, it can be significantly more expensive.<br><br>To contribute to cost savings, we have an effort underway to develop integrated hardening methodologies that provide protection against multiple hazards. Our initial work focuses on integrated protection against the effects of both high altitude EMP and high powered microwaves produced with non-nuclear sources.<br><br>SIMULATION TO VALIDATE HEMP PROTECTION<br><br>We acquired much of our understanding of high altitude EMP effects and the protection needed from the development and effective use of nuclear weapon effects simulators. DoD currently operates a suite of simulators that provides the needed capabilities for large area, threat-level field illumination, direct current injection techniques, and low-level, continuous wave (CW) illumination to evaluate shield integrity and energy coupling efficiencies. These simulators are used in combination to validate a system's overall EMP protection.<br><br>STATE OF UNDERSTANDING<br><br>High Altitude EMP, System Generated EMP, and Radiation Effects are genuine, widespread hazards produced by even one nuclear weapon. We know how to protect against these EMP and radiation threats. Such protection is affordable, if provided for at an early stage in system design and development. For a tactical system, the cost can be as little as 1% of the total development investment; for strategic systems, a target of 5% is reasonable. Retrofitting protection after a system has been deployed can be considerably more expensive.<br><br>The pace of new developments in the fields of electronics and computers can be daunting. There is a new generation of microelectronics technology every eighteen months. Some of these new technologies are inherently more susceptible to nuclear threats. DoD has recognized and responded to these and other challenges. As outlined in the SecretaryÃ­s May 1997 report on Nuclear Weapon Systems Sustainment Programs, additional funds have been programmed to ensure that core DoD requirements for advanced radiation hardened microelectronics technology are met. More recently, a Radiation Hard Oversight Council was established to ensure these efforts have appropriate visibility and oversight.<br><br>EMP does not distinguish between military and civilian systems. Unhardended systems, such as commercial power grids, telecommunications networks, and computing systems, remain vulnerable to widespread outages and upsets due to HEMP. While DoD hardens assets it deems vital, no comparable civil program exists. Thus, the detonation of one or a few high-altitude nuclear weapons could result in devastating problems for the entire U.S. commercial infrastructure. Some detailed network analyses of critical civil systems would be useful to better understand the magnitude of the problem and define possible solution paths. </blockquote></div>

Actually I do believe many of US forces equipments being COTS orientated, are not EMP proven.

            <div class='col-md body'>Yes, the article is half-correct, but it has to be taken in its context. Since the end of the cold war the threat of EMP has been significantly reduced as a possible threat, as well as the military relying more on off-the-shelf technology that were came from civillian items. Also one must note that using civillian electronics has become more commonplace as the US military is currently making the transition to a Future Force Concept.<br><br>As a result, a lot of their newer stuff like laptops and the like that are basically civillian conversions are more vulnerable to EMP attack then a system that was designed with milspec in mind from the start. But once these technologies mature EMP protection will certainly be a part of their newest equipment all over again.<br><br>However in context of their key weapons systems like their carriers and the like EMP protection is still standard as part of their design. The F-22 is certainly EMP protected, as is their naval ships and the like. It's the grunt that has to worry most about EMP affecting his equipment.<br><br>But then again in any case, the most effective way to use EMP on a wide scale is to go nuclear, which isn't really an option in most conflicts, not to mention most people don't use nukes with the EMP effect in mind.<br><br>The useage of EMP on a tactical scale (conventional E-bombs) deal far less damage and are more limited in their scope. Not to mention ineffective against properly protected equipment. Certainly not the kind of one-shot gives us victory against them kind of weapon.<br><br>As the article pointed out, the Yanks are aware of the danger and that they slacking about it.
