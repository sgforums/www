              <p>Optical tracking and CLOS is currently the only way use to engage hostiles, the missile is guided by inputs from the gunner. I believe the radar you mentioned would be the Ericsson Giraffe.</p>
              <p>Due to our location there is heavy cloud cover most of the time. And when it rains, visibility really drops by alot. Singapore skyline is really bright at night through night vision, however i'm guessing that the gunners are counting on a blackout when the time comes where they would have to mount their night sight on the system.</p>

              <p>True, but SHORAD doesn't apply to just deployment in Singapore itself. </p>
              <p>The RBS system used here is also mounted on v200s and not forgetting m113 ultra and their IGLAs. Which probably means mobile air defence for our armour in a combined arms concept</p>
              <p>Its no secret that at the DA's are named after the div they are attached to. So 3da = 3rd div, 6da = 6div, 9da = 9div etc, so on. So now... 18da would be??</p>

              <p>Our RBS 70s are employed mainly to protect forward deployed ground forces. Thats the reason why many are mounted on V200s to give them mobility.</p>
              <p>Although the RBS 70 is a relatively older SHORAD the fact  remains that it is still in in many armed forces. It is testament to its effectiveness. The missile itself has gone thru several updates which make it more lethal and also increases its effective target envelope.  </p>
              <p>It is an all  aspect missile although new IR and IIR  SAMs are also all aspect - however being a beam rider, it is more difficult to decoy. Also, downside is that it is dependent on the skill and nerve of the gunner. If our conscript is not motivated , then our National Education program and his officers are not doing their job.  </p>
              <p>RBS 70 is part of a very varied SAF SHORAD system. With Iglas, Rapiers, RBS 70s, Mistrals, 35 mm guns using IR, optical and different radar systems for missile guidance, an enemy air force will face immense problems beating a SHORAD system employed by SAF.    </p>
              <p>What needs replacement is the  I HAWK . Again , it is a excellent medium range SAM , but is a bit long in the tooth. As mentioned elsewhere  in this forum, there is probably already a replacement in place.      </p>
