And personally i think throwing a stick is easier than throwing a ball unless you have baseball training before.<br><br>However, a stick grenade also have its problems such as it takes up more space. A point to note is that nobody produces and uses stick grenades anymore, for reasons unknown to me.<br><br>Stielhandgranate: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model_24_grenade" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model_24_grenade</a></div>

It is when you are standing right beside the window and there's enemy inside the room. I don't see how you can "roll" a grenade through a window. A doorway, maybe. But even then, if the ground is uneven or full of debris, rolling is not a very clever thing to do. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"> </div></blockquote>ok, noted. in your case... oh man.. I can imagine a square grenade  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br><br>the "toss" I was referring to is more of a lob for a distance, and let the momentum have the the grenade roll with the shape-there is where it starts to look like a bowling ball. Yeah. A doorway or corridor, as you said.</div>

The training areas are simply too clean.  The rooms do not have enough debri to simulate real world.</div>
