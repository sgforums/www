Israel has supplied a Green Pine radar, which forms part of the Phalcon system, to India to bolster its air defence network.<br><br>Commenting on Israel Army Radio, Yuval Steinitz, the Defence and Foreign Relations Chairman in the Knesset or Israeli Parliament, said the "US pressure is not legitimate" if was actually a form of business competition.<br><br>"It is not wise to confront Washington, but we have to maintain our interests," he said.<br><br>If Israel has to choose between angering Washington and disappointing New Delhi, it is likely to accede to the American request, given its close friendly ties and dependence on Washington, said security experts here.<br><br>Sagging under a mammoth budgetary deficit due to its nearly three-year-long military confrontation with the Palestinians and with gloomy prospects for an early economic recovery, Israel is likely to take the US threat seriously.<br><br>Moreover, the Phalcon includes American components and under a production agreement, Israel must obtain US approval for sales to third countries.<br><br>The US request is reminiscent of the Pentagon's opposition to an earlier Israeli agreement to sell a Phalcon system to China in August 2000.<br><br>Due to sharp tensions between China and Taiwan at the time, the US vetoed the Israeli sale, sparking an angry reaction from Beijing.<br><br>The US opposition to the deal was based on fears that China's acquisition of the Phalcon would strengthen its strategic capabilities in the event of a military confrontation in the region.<br><br>The Pentagon's veto soured Israel's relations with China. Beijing, which had already paid almost a third of the Phalcon deal worth $250 million, froze major Israeli arms contracts. This was followed by months of negotiations on compensation, with at least three high-level<br>Israeli defence missions being sent to Beijing to placate the offended Chinese.<br><br>Only recently, after tensions had long subsided, Israel received US clearance to resume sales to China and frozen Israeli arms contracts have gone through.<br><br></div>

All we need to do is jus to balance out with a little more to our side when every time they buy a new toy , to avoid being critise as starting a race.<br><br>eg. When we have centurions , they dun have so be it , we are at advantage , we dun need to go further to get any modern MBT. But once they have their PT-91 , being the more affluent party , we will get Apaches , Spikes , MBTs to drown them.<br><br>The trick is that , we will alow them to get their toy first.  Once they have it , we will rush in to purchase ours , making sure we have the toughest of that class in large quantities. This way , no one will point fingers. Or another thing is that , we will keep quiet . Wait till tension run high , we will dig our pockets and get wat ever we want , making sure again we are at the upper hand.( this is seen between China and Taiwan )<br><br>At present our situation is everywhere better that the malaysian counterpart. Their purchase are onli to get in par with us. Once they finish their purchased , its our turn. Dun worry , we are waiting for our turn after they finish their reserve draining shopping.......<br><br>Remember the time , we allow malaysia to get their MEKO then we bought more advance frigate. They annouce the MLRS then we annouce the Apache. They annouce their F-18D , we annouce more F-16s. They annouce the R-77 , we annouce Amraam. They annouce their SUs as the MRCA , we are annoucing our 4th generation fighter soon.</div>
