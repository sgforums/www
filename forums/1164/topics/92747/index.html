If you're wondering what it means, its our dear friend's nickname for SG (just like how we use Mudland as a substitute for MY.)<br>PSK can mean one of two things: "Pulau Sekangkang Kera" (Monkey lan jiao   island <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"> ) or more recently "Pulau SARS Kechil" (this one you can figure out yourselves. )<br><br><blockquote>If you browse sgforums, there are some NS guys who claimed to be members of Sg elite units, but we all know better. Maybe utk naikkan nama depa dan naikkan saham depa, tu yg depa masuk commando training. Baru depa tau betapa susah yer nak jadi ahli commando</blockquote><blockquote>true that zim...they're always bragging in that forum... maybe we could even take them out in a fist-fight...</blockquote><blockquote>But those guys over there can only use their fingers to play PS2s..and they use their fist for..ermm..something else..</blockquote>Tripwire will find this interesting  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"> :<br><br><blockquote>Aother loser is <strong>keke</strong>, at World Defence Forum, always thinking PSK is so powerful and always laughing at our capabilities. </blockquote>Of course, there are more if you care to check. Most is in Bahasa as the cheeky blighters are trying to make sure we can't read their ramblings.

            <div class='col-md body'>I've been reading thru their forums for quite a long time. They seem to assume that no one understands what they post (in Malay).<br><br>Most of it (the posts) are of course pro-Malaysia, which is understandable, being a Malaysian forum. They have nothing nice to say about Singapore, or even the rest of the region. Our Thai and Phillipino friends should read what they post too. (eg. Thai "chickens" for Russian aircraft, Phillipine SOF are a joke, Matador LAW is Supersoaker)<br><br>Most of the forums members there have never served in the armed forces, and lack any real understanding military issues. (Actually, very similar situation to kids who post here who have not served their NS) Only very few members, I belive are current or former members of the Malaysian Armed Forces. Their own lack of understanding will be their own downfall (eg. refusing to belive that the forum members here have actually serve in the SAF)<br><br>They don't understand Singapore's defense model of conscripts and reserves, and view full-time NS as the main fighting force, without any regard or conideration for the reserves. They assume that our are soldiers are pretty young - probably by observing recruits in their number 4 uniforms on weekends.<br><br>And the list goes on and on....................<br><br></div>

At the way some of the posters there are throwing barbs at everyone in the region and beyond, they will have no shortage of enemies.<br><br>2) If they were from Singapore, then all I can say to these Singaporeans is, why stoop to their level to degrade yourself like they have degraded themselves?<br><br>3) Some advice to those who are from *that* forum, do unto others what you want others to do unto you. If you can't take the heat, don't bother stepping into the kitchen.<br><br>4) Finally, why the defensiveness by shutting off access to the forums except to those who have registered? To keep out bad hats? But then, isn't that what moderators are for? Surely, with moderators who *can be bothered*, theres no need to take such a drastic and draconian measure.</div>
