            <div class='col-md body'>The recent accident involving a Singapore PV is really distressing. Firstly we lost naval personnel. Secondly, we lost a patrol vessel.Thirdly, the lowering morale. All these will have quite a negative impact on the RSN. At the same time i have realise another "problem". The Malaysian navy have many frigates already in service. These frigates though not all from the same source(logistic and training problem) are all new and technologically advanced. They also already have naval helos in operation. Their new Scorpene submarines are almost definitely superior to our Challenger class "training"subs(assumming that we only do tropicalisation for the subs as maintained by the navy). I have no doubt that we still have the bite in our navy,however i am worried that our naval deterrence and superiority is decreasing fast. Can anyone prove me otherwise? Please bear in mind to compare navy to navy and not individual equiptment to equiptment.Thanks <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I think there must be a right mix in technological quality and manpower quality.  The first is easier to achieve because it is measurable in many aspects and can be done if there's the know-how, captial and will to do so.  The second is more difficult to achieve.  Because it can only be measured by actual performances, organizations like the SAF don't really have much to gauge with.</div>

While as much as I like us to maintain if not expand the capability gap, I am not so sure that we should then follow on with hardware purchases to do so. Moreover, as some of the senior members have rightfully pointed out, it is not JUST hardware comparision.<br><br>Perhaps we need to work harder on thinking out of the box and come up with simple idea but effective ones. I draw your attention to the way the egyptians penetrated Isreal defensive sandbank, they use water cannons, instead of conventional bombs.<br><br>Perhaps what we need is to "transform" warfare with new way of fighting. Stealth? New methods? Precision weapons? Was it not what Chief of Airforce that says today we think of how many targets for an aircraft rather than how many aircraft needed for a target.<br><br>I have faith that our RSN planners are not idling, perhaps they may already be working out a solution.</div>
