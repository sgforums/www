This will put the flying height of the drone - which can be<br>manned or unpiloted - 'above the airways'.<br>This is the first time Mindef has revealed the Lalee's operating height and<br>the fact that it can carry a pilot.<br>The Lalee UAV is a large twin-boom, single-span aircraft which carries its<br>sensor payload slung between a central pod. The drone's name is an acronym<br>which stands for 'low altitude, long-enduring endurance'.<br>The Lalee project is complemented by efforts to develop tiny new UAVs. These<br>drones - a Tailsitter UAV which is smaller than a golf bag and a palm-sized<br>device called the Sparrow - are being engineered by ST Engineering's unit, ST<br>Dynamics.<br>These tiny battlefield surveillance devices made their public debut at Asian<br>Aerospace 2002 this morning.<br>The C4I conference was held to discuss issues related to command, control,<br>communication, computers and intelligence - essentially the synergy of<br>weapons, computers, and wireless communications. Defence planners nowadays use<br>an extended acronym for battle management called 'C4ISR' with the last two<br>letters referring to surveillance and reconnaissance missions.<br>Prof Lui said Mindef's long-standing investments in aerial drones and other<br>advanced sensors underscores Singapore's commitment to giving its defences<br>more strategic depth.<br>Engineers from Mindef, the Defence Science and Technology Agency (DSTA) and<br>ST Engineering are finishing the Lalee's preliminary design in partnership<br>with its US-based designer, Burt Rutan.<br>DSTA is using Asian Aerospace 2002 to showcase its capability in C4ISR<br>expertise. At yesterday's conference, one of DSTA's industrial partners, ST<br>Electronics, also unveiled its Futuristic Soldier System suite of advanced<br>weapons sensors for the first time.<br>Teo Chin Hock, director (CSO) at DSTA, told BT: 'We see our local defence<br>industry as a very critical and strategic partner, especially in providing<br>engineering development and supporting those systems we acquire.'<br>Mr Teo said DSTA engineers have been involved in C4I-related projects 'for a<br>long time' and are focusing on developing information capabilities through<br>'exploration, experimentation and evolutionary development', a concept known<br>in defence circles as E3D.<br>'Basically we go off and explore concepts, experiment with technology and<br>evolve a system. In this area, the battlefield is changing constantly and the<br>technology changes even faster. So we've to evolve the requirements and build<br>according to these changes,' he said.<br>Mr Teo said the E3D concept entails extensive use of modelling and computer<br>simulations by DSTA's battle labs. E3D allows Singapore to engineer customised<br>solutions for the Republic's C4ISR needs. A lot of such work involves joint<br>projects with foreign partners.<br>He said: 'We put a lot of focus on forging new partnerships both with local<br>and overseas R&amp;D partners to share and innovate on ideas and conduct<br>experiments. We collaborate a lot with defence industry partners to produce<br>field and support systems that are evolved through this E3D approach.<br>'We are viewed as a very credible partner and we're placed on equal<br>partnership with our foreign friends in bringing things to the table. The<br>value that we bring to the table is in terms of new operational capabilities<br>that we have when we work together for our armed forces.'<br></strong><br><br>A bit off topic from "Navies".... ..The article above appeared in The Business Times on 26 Feb, 2002.<br><br>Harimau... I somewhat suspect that "Lalee" will be a tad larger than the UAV you mentioned. Thanks much for your spec ops pictures. Do you have any of PASKAL or HANDAU? I saw them on parade on Sept 16... funky berets!<br><br>Cheers<br><br>db<br></div>

Literally, "special sea service". The unit's penyelam penyerang ("attack/assault divers") are regarded as amongst the elite in Angkatan Tentera Malaysia (ATM; Malaysia Armed Forces).<br><br>PASKAL was formed in 1975 when the main Tentera Laut Diraja Malaysia (TLDM) base was at KD Malaya, located at  - are you sitting down? - Woodlands!<br><br>The unit was declassified on 1 Oct 1980.<br><br>PASKAL qualified troops wear maroon berets.<br><br>HANDAU is the special forces unit in Tentera Udara Diraja Malaysia (TUDM, Royal Malaysia Air Force).  It's an acronym for Pertahanan Udara, which literally means air defence but it functions as an airborne capable jungle rescue unit.<br><br>HANDAU troops wear light blue berets.<br><br>The tri-Service ATM contingent that marches on Malaysia Day usually comprises these troops, plus those from GGK (Group Gerak Khas, i.e. broadly similar to the Commandos).
