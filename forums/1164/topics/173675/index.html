But the scenrio may be very different from what you are saying.<br><br>1st China don't have a credible fleet for a cross-strait landed operation. 2nd if they do , they will be a high price to pay. You must consider what will happen inside china 1st .<br><br>At first people will support the war, but as casualties mount , and you must consider the whole country workers come to a standstill due to stopage of trade . Imagine out of that 1.3 billion folk how many factory workers. Factory don't start work, shipment of goods oversea stop,  equal no money, no food .  3 mths down the road, you have 0.2 billion angry folks, hungry folks that will slowly turn against the government in china for a stupid war.

            <div class='col-md body'>War between PRC and Taiwan is very unlikely in the near future. This is because there is growing social instability in China due to large gap between the poor and the rich. The rich mainly from the coastal cities are very rich while the poor mainly from the inland regions are very poor. Economic sanctions are very likely to be imposed on PRC by USA so out of desperation these poor peasants will cause civil unrest and even rise in revolt. There are already many civil unrests lately due to corruption in the provinces.

If there is a war, it is likely to be start by China. Look at the way they run their country, Internet things also censor here censor there.<br><br>I think US will help abit, not alot as war is costly to them. I don't think US can help everybody, besides, China is not a small country like Iraq.<br><br>In a war, nobody really wins I think. There will be many casaulties.<br><br>It will take at least months for the war to end, Taiwan is no pushover either. They have good secret technologies I am sure. I believe China have sent spies to do some recon first in Taiwan, know the enemy know yourself. In fact, China seems to send spies everywhere, even to US.<br><br>I think if there is a war breaking out, it's not good to alot of countries. Worse case, there may be world war 3 when countries starts to side with one or the other.</div>
