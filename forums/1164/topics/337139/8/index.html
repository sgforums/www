              <p>the problem with the viking and its replacement by the ATTC is
                                          not because its a incompetent vehicle platform or that is so flawed
                                          that it cant be rectified. the problem with the viking / BvS10, is
                                          that it has <strong>reached the limits of its capability
                                          growth</strong>.</p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">i.e, you can only add on so much armour to a proven platform.
                                          additional armour costs greater wear and tear on the engine and
                                          transmission. use under combat conditions implies increased wear
                                          and tear and mileage.</span></strong></span></p>
              <p>the viking as a platform is <strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">combat exhausted</span>. </strong>it has reached the
                                          <strong>end of its capability upgrade curve</strong>. any further
                                          upgrades would probably NOT be cost effective and wasting money on
                                          a worn-out / overused platform.</p>
              <p>2 years of combat wear and tear under operational conditions
                                          have probably subjected the viking to the equivalent of about 10
                                          years worth of peacetime operations. <strong>is it worth spending
                                          on a SLEP / refurb program on something that has no future
                                          potential for growth without incurring a performance penalty

                                          information without thinking them through ?</p>
              <p>what is right armour ? does right armour mean heavy armour ?
                                          what kinds of armour platforms are you talking about ? what
                                          qualities of that kinda armour ? what kind of terrain that armour
                                          is operating on ? how reliable is that armour under certain terrain
                                          conditions ? does that armor platform have capability upgrade
                                          options ? does it have future growth potential ?</p>

              <p>why ? dont realize that your objectives completly dont make sense ?</p>
              <p>1) uparmour for more protection = less speed and strain on engine/transmission, ceterius paribus</p>
              <p>2) lesser armour for lesser protection = more speed, less wear and tear on engine/transmission, ceterius paribus</p>
              <p>3) wartime opeartions means heavier use of vehicle in comparatively more punishing conditions as compared to peacetime operations (like DUH!)</p>
              <p>4) 1 and 2 are mutually exclusive. not possible to acheive both without substantial upgrades and downtime. coupled with fact 3, which makes the expense needed to refurbish and reequip the viking for such a purpose, not cost efficient.</p>
              <p>5) the viking has no future potential growth capacity unless it were given 1. it can be. but at great cost, downtime (and reduction in number of vikings avaliable for service in afghanistan) and little benefit for Long term plans (poor future LR prospects)</p>
              <p>consider these 5 simple points. and you will arrive at the same conclusion i did. they are irreconcillable objectives. thats probably why the UK MOD chose the ATTC over the BvS10. your mind is as thick as mud</p>
              <p>might as well send UK MOD soldiers on roller blade skates and equip em with kangaroo jump boots. can jump away from mines and IEDs if we follow you</p>

              <p>Get my drift?</p>
              <p>Even a monkey with a brain tumour can tell that you're just pushing your mindless hate OZ and anything not SG agenda on this forum.</p>
              <p>Get out. Please. For everyone's bloody sake.</p>
              <p>Noisy Pussy, you don't need one more person telling you what a wasted excuse for humanity you are. Your kind truly occupies the lowest rung of our evolutionary ladder.</p>
