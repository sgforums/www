              <p><br>YES!! YES!!<br>By your logic, Both Frigates and MCMVs are also ships classified under Jane's Fighting Ships.

Likewise, M777 and Pegasus are for different uses and purposes. Yes, both are howitzers, no doubt. Both are of same calibre no doubt. But, there is still a need for forces to have both towed and SP howitzers for tactical reasons. If not, why are FH2000 and some FH88 still in service? Why dun SAF (or other armed forces across the world fot that matter) just standardise and soley rely on SPHs ???<br><br><strong>But, my main point is that, by comparing a TH  and a SPH is like comparing a frigate to a MCMV, or, for ur dumb mind, a land rover and a 5-tonner together... </strong><br><br>I know the reason, They know the reason ...<br>But it seems that u are the only one who doesn't know</p>

              <p>dude, dont bother wasting time to reply to him.</p>
              <p>he's an attention-whore and deserves this, let me quote myself in a reply to his nonsense</p>
              <blockquote>
              <p>i learn that to (pretty applicable to anyone who gets irritated
                                      with lionnoisy)</p>
              <p>1) respond logically is to sublimally
                                      <strong>acknowledge</strong> the inherent stupidity in your logic
                                      and try to argue against something which is supremely flawed.</p>
              <p>2) to respond is to lend your screwed up/ swiss cheese/
                                      Illogic/UNlogic <strong>credibility</strong></p>
              <p>3) to lend your logic credibility, in any means, is to
                                      <strong>lend you credibility</strong></p>
              <p>4) to lend you credibility, is to <strong>justify and implicitly
                                      endorse, your existence</strong> here</p>
              <p>5) to endorse your existence, would be to <strong>condone the
                                      content</strong> of your posting. which i will not do since
                                      <span style="color: #ff0000;">i m intellectually opposed to your
                                      nonsense, morally apalled by your bigotry (and utter lack of
                                      respect and balance) and physically offended by your
                                      idiocity.</span></p>
              <p>therefore, i conclude according to these four principles, you
                                      dont deserve a coherent response. a coherent response only serves
                                      to embolden you and encourage you. Do you give liquer chocolates to
                                      a recovering alcoholic ? do you bring a recovering drug addict to
                                      his pusher ? do you allow a porno addict access to porno films
                                      ?</p>
              <p>Decartes was famous for these words, I think, therefore i am.
                                      let me borrow that and apply my understanding of that to you.</p>
              <p>you crap, therefore you are crap.</p>

              <p>therefore, cannot post replies, you are encouraging him.</p>

              <p><em> A light weight 155mm 39 calibre howitzer, the

              <p>I wander why u guys so insist that Pegasus shall be a SP gun.</p>
              <p>I just compare small small items with M 777 and dare not</p>
              <p>to declare which one is better in OVERALL.</p>
              <p>If u find anythings interesting about Pegasus,good or bad,</p>
              <p>u can also share here.Why not?</p>
              <p>So long the stuff can save the ass of SAF,I dunt care</p>

              <p>etc.Ok Ok.Pl tell me what are the plus points---</p>
              <p>----assist to load the shells(Thats why Pegasus can shoot 2 /min for 30 min)</p>
              <p>..........(no rod ramming is needed ,by 2 men!!)</p>
              <p>-----set and reset the gun</p>
              <p>---faster in dis/emplacement( a matter of live and death)</p>
              <p>---better manuever in narrow terrain(urban)</p>
              <p>---communications and sight setting.</p>

              <p>Decision is an art.There are too many smart guys just look</p>
              <p>at one side of the coin.Which rule in books of army say</p>
              <p>no engine shall be installed in towed gun?</p>
              <p>Men shall not be bounded by stupid rules,if there is any.</p>
              <p>It is just human bound by themselves.</p>
              <p>When there is no towed gun with an engine in the inventory,</p>
              <p>no one dare to propose one.What are the down sides if u instal</p>
              <p>a engine in a towed gun?</p>
              <p>Do u think it is fun to ram the shell into the chamber?</p>

              <p>The Self-Propelled Howitzer is meant to keep up with the rapid advance of armored formations in combat.  If it can't keep up with the typical speeds of armored advance, it cannot be considered a self-propelled howitzer.  </p>
              <p>The Pegasus I believe is ordinarily towed.  The ability to move itself allows the gun to positioned quickly without requiring the tonner driver to somehow maneuver the gun to the approximate position and having artillerymen set up by hand.  IMO, it just hastens up the process which the pegasus can be deployed.</p>
              <p>Another consideration is that the Pegasus is supposed to support guardsmen with their type of operation where it is required to be flown in.  Now, can't expect to always have the Pegasus to be flown in together with a tonner right?  So it requires some form of innate ability to move about. </p>
              <p>As I've mentioned in the previous post.  The Marines are pretty happy with the M777A2.  Doesn't really have anything to do with our Pegasus. </p>

              advance of armored formations in combat.  If it can't keep up
              with the typical speeds of armored advance, it cannot be considered
              a self-propelled howitzer.  </p>
              <p>The Pegasus I believe is ordinarily towed.  The ability to
              move itself allows the gun to positioned quickly without requiring
              the tonner driver to somehow maneuver the gun to the approximate
              position and having artillerymen set up by hand.  IMO, it just
              hastens up the process which the pegasus can be deployed.</p>
              <p>Another consideration is that the Pegasus is supposed to support
              guardsmen with their type of operation where it is required to be
              flown in.  Now, can't expect to always have the Pegasus to be
              flown in together with a tonner right?  So it requires some
              form of innate ability to move about. </p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">As I've mentioned in the previous post.  The Marines are
              pretty happy with the M777A2.  Doesn't really have anything to
              do with our Pegasus. </span></p>

              Australian Defence Force ( ADF) has declined a Dutch offer of 18
              Kraus-Maffei Wegmann PzH2000 155 mm self-propelled howitzers (SPHs) to
              meet a major part of the ADF’s Land 17 artillery replacement programme.
              <br><br>The Royal Netherlands Army has declared 18 of the 57 PzH2000s
              it has on order as surplus to requirements. The guns, offered to
              Australia at what is understood to be an advantageous price, have yet
              to be built........</blockquote><blockquote>The Land 17 requirement for up to four batteries (35 platforms) of
              lightweight towed 155 mm howitzers has specified a maximum gun weight
              of 5,040 kg to allow transportation by a ballistically protected Boeing

              <p>Erm......i think the best is to try out M777 and Pegasus in a battle if you would want the most fair way</p>
              <p>Battle One:</p>
              <p>M777 shot at Pegasus, see Pegasus can counter</p>
              <p>Battle Two:</p>
              <p>Pegasus shot at M777, see M777 can counter</p>
              <p>counter means that is it counter-battery ability as well as move to next position</p>
              <p>In addition, remember M777 is designed for US, US have a lot of weapon, they dun care a f****** M777 is been damaged, so they could made do with such a make</p>
              <p>However, Pegasus is designed for SG, SG cannot lose a Pegasus like USMC did for a M777.</p>
              <p>So both of them win in their own limits</p>

              <p>1) artillery work in batteries<br>2) there's a difference between a self propelled gun and a self propelled howitzer<br>3) artillery fire is measured in grid squares on the map<br>4) artillery is subject to tracking from counter batteries and other counter mechanisms.</p>

              <p>Dear All,</p>
              <p>How about i ask u to use First Generation Hand Phone as heavy as</p>
              <p>a brick in 2008 or i ask u use a 286 CPU?</p>
              <p><img src="http://i17.ebayimg.com/07/i/000/f9/d3/35fe_2.JPG" alt="" width="200" height="150"></p>
              <p>This one not old enough.</p>
              <p>But M 777 just tell u like using a 30 years old HP!!</p>
              <p><strong><em><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">Currently,M777 dunt get any flick rammer.!!</span></span></em></strong></p>
              <p>Pl dunt tell me the future.I want NOW&gt;NOW!!</p>
              <p>The FH 88 launched in 1988(yes eighty eight) gets auto flick rammer!!</p>
              <p>OMG!!Why do  the soldiers work like a donkey to push</p>
              <p>the rod rammer to push the shell into the barrel,in 2008???</p>
              <p>U will tell me becos M 777 dunt get a APU or engine for</p>
              <p>setting gun ,flick ramming etc.</p>
              <p>Then can u weigh the pro and con and install one.</p>
              <p>This is damn stupid just to look a one side of the coin.</p>
              <p>In decision making,u need to weigh all the pro and con.</p>
              <p>See how the 20 years old Singapore FH 88 works----</p>
              <p><em><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">A flick rammer is used with power derived from an independent power
              pack.The hydropneumatic recoil mechanism is of the independent-type

              <p>u need machine help to deliver substain and consistant fire.</p>
              <p>Can u deliver 2 rounds per mins for 30 mins,by 2 men rod ramming?</p>
              <p>Pegasus can,becos it gets a engine APU.</p>
              <p>without flick rammer,it seem u have to double clutch Land Rover</p>

              <p>LOL moron lion, tell me, how do counter-battery artillery fire and radar detect the M777 before m777 fire ?</p>
              <p>in case you realize, what is the range of arty ? you mean USMC or US army commanders are retarded to enough to site an artillery battery within range of counter battery fire ?</p>
              <p>*yawn* in case you havent realized, pegasus APU is more for autoloading rather than moving the pegasus around.</p>
              <p>use a brain will you ? pegasus APU has a speed of 12km/H. ok, lets say pegasus fire on enemy position, shell takes 15 mins to reach the enemy position. enemy counter battery radar tracks the shell, pinpoints the pegasus firing position.</p>
              <p>ASSUMING no time is needed to pack the pegasus and assuming that the terrain is complete flat ground and the top speed of 12km/h is achieved (which isnt possible) and assuming that the enemy counter battery fire takes 20 mins to fire and for the shells to hit the position</p>
              <p>u realize that your pegasus has only moved 4km ? you realize that if the enemy has a MLRS fire battery dedicated to counter battery fire that would be the end of the entire pegasus artillery battery ? you realize even a regular artillery battery would be able to obliterate that grid square ?</p>
              <p>you realize that studying map terrain and extrapolating from the approximate fire position, the enemy is able to destroy , block or cut off the pegasus regiment from any evacuation point or resup point ?</p>
              <p>you realize you just SELF-PWNED ?</p>
              <p>and yes, i think we should all take a 286 or 1st gen mobile phone and throw it at your head. you arent using it moron. you deserve it for talking crap like this .</p>
              <p>and please answer this qn :</p>
