              <p>LOL moron lion, tell me, how do counter-battery artillery fire
              and radar detect the M777 before m777 fire ?</p>
              <p>in case you realize, what is the range of arty ? you mean USMC
              or US army commanders are retarded to enough to site an artillery
              battery within range of counter battery fire ?</p>
              <p>*yawn* in case you havent realized, pegasus APU is more for
              autoloading rather than moving the pegasus around.</p>
              <p>use a brain will you ? pegasus APU has a speed of 12km/H. ok,
              lets say pegasus fire on enemy position, shell takes 15 mins to
              reach the enemy position. enemy counter battery radar tracks the
              shell, pinpoints the pegasus firing position.</p>
              <p>ASSUMING no time is needed to pack the pegasus and assuming that
              the terrain is complete flat ground and the top speed of 12km/h is
              achieved (which isnt possible) and assuming that the enemy counter
              battery fire takes 20 mins to fire and for the shells to hit the
              position</p>
              <p>u realize that your pegasus has only moved 4km ? you realize
              that if the enemy has a MLRS fire battery dedicated to counter
              battery fire that would be the end of the entire pegasus artillery
              battery ? you realize even a regular artillery battery would be
              able to obliterate that grid square ?</p>
              <p>you realize that studying map terrain and extrapolating from the
              approximate fire position, the enemy is able to destroy , block or
              cut off the pegasus regiment from any evacuation point or resup
              point ?</p>
              <p>you realize you just SELF-PWNED ?</p>
              <p>and yes, i think we should all take a 286 or 1st gen mobile
              phone and throw it at your head. you arent using it moron. you

              <p>kkk</p>
              <p>Can u move a M 777 up or down a HDB car park ramp,with the 8 to 10</p>
              <p>gunners?Do u think <em><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">on mountain sides (ask u say) will post a more challenge</span></span></em></p>
              <p>situation for u ,if not impossible, to move your 3175 kg M 777?</p>
              <p>FYI,a 1.6 to 1.8 liter Japanse saloon weigh 1200 to 1400 kg.</p>
              <p>That mean ,with 10 guys,u have to move a weight of 3 saloon cars</p>
              <p>up and down on mountain sides?Dunt forget it is a rough terrain,with rocks</p>
              <p>on the ground.I think u can if u are on flat and smooth parade ground.</p>
              <p>@@@@@@@@@@</p>
              <p>i suggest u ask 10 guys to push a lorry up a HDB carpark ramp.</p>
              <p>If u can,then come back and tell us.</p>
              <p>@@@@@@@@@@</p>
              <p>Weigh is not a problem if u have a APU--engine to move the gun.</p>
              <p>But it is a problem if u are powerless and very light say,3175 kg!!</p>
              <p>If u dare to tell me u can push 3175 kg up and down</p>
              <p>a HDB car park ramp with 10 men,then i salute u.</p>
              <p>If u cant,then dunt think about move a M 777 in mountain sides.</p>

              <p>To your Q1:</p>
              <p>If USMC commander know the ability of counter fire,he has a crystal ball.</p>
              <p>In war or conflict,u dunt know what u dunt know.</p>
              <p>Q2----APU is for short range movement and loading shell.</p>
              <p>i read FH 88 or 2000 can move SP 60 km without refilling.</p>
              <p>U say assume no time to pack....</p>
              <p>With the APU,u just press few butons and let the machine do the job.</p>
              <p>It take less than 3 mins to emplace and displace.</p>
              <p>If the time is not enogh,then it is too bad becos it is the best</p>
              <p>we give to SAF.If Pegasus cant do fast enough with machine,</p>
              <p>how about M 777 which is powerless?</p>
              <p>Pegasu shoot and scoot can increase the chance to survive.</p>
              <p>I am sure it is much better than sitting duck M 777,before</p>
              <p>towing facilities arrive.</p>
              <p>I dunt know if MLRS or heli to block Pegasus and kill the battery.</p>

              <p>I'm basing this on the fact that the US Army uses the gun to fight in Afghanistan, a country well known for hilly areas that are pretty inaccessible to most vehicles. In fact the gun has been great in Afghanistan, offering firepower for the infantry units fighting on the hill sides.</p>

              <p>3 mins not time is it ? what happens when APU fail ? what happens when APU damaged ? pegasus becomes like you ? big, high profile but absolutely USELESS ? giant piece of metal crap ? (in your case mental crap) ?</p>
              <p>shoot and scoot ? dont make me laugh. you clearly demonstrate no knowledge about artillery operational doctrine and so kindly STFU. u think its possible to shoot and scoot in 3 mins in that kinda timing under operational conditions ? you think your terrain  gentle and forgiving on you ?</p>
              <p>you think every battle is fought on perfectly flat land ground like tennis court ? u shoot i shoot ?</p>
              <p>think again and think hard. because you obviously havent done it. APU isnt used for shoot and scoot. its more for its autoloading fuctions than anything else. the APU only serves as a driving motor in a secondary backup capacity in case it cannot be moved by transport vehicles.</p>
              <p>m777 cannot use ATV or humvee to pull ? m777 supported by how many helicopter assets ? m777 can be lifted by what range of helicopter assets in USMC or US army inventory ? CH53 ? blackhawk ? MV 22 ospery ? CH-47D ?</p>
              <p>Pegasus can be lifted by how many assets in RSAF inventory ? please answer this question. remember that Pegasus is a specialized product to overcome specialized needs that pose a operational liability in manpower scarce SAF</p>

              <p>MLRS has a massive kill zone. with the evolving trend of GLMRS, there's an even higher likelihood of percision counter battery fire designed to destroy enemy batteries.</p>
              <p>and do you even understand the concept of protection blanket ? CO is concerned with Local area protection blanket.</p>
              <p>answer the question now, how can a local protection blanket (1~2 km) protect against counter-battery fire with 40km range for regular artillery and approximately &gt;70 km for GLMRS / MLRS batteries ?</p>

              @lion 
              
              m777 was not meant to do the job the pegasus can simply becuz the US thinks they have other ways to get around it. they lowered the weight so that it can be towed quicker than the m198 and can be carried by heli. with that, they were happy enough.
              
              btw US believes the tonners should hang around the deployed arty pieces.
              
              if your argument is about how much better the gun become after automation, if it does, pls make it clear.

              <p>you think every battle is fought on perfectly flat land ground

              <p>think again and think hard. because you obviously havent done
              it. APU isnt used for shoot and scoot. its more for its autoloading

              <p>m777 cannot use ATV or humvee to pull ? m777 supported by how

              please answer this question. remember that Pegasus is a specialized

              batteries cannot have reasonable protection blanket ?</p>
              <p>MLRS has a massive kill zone. with the evolving trend of GLMRS,

              <p>and do you even understand the concept of protection blanket ?
              CO is concerned with Local area protection blanket.</p>
              <p>answer the question now, how can a local protection blanket (1~2
              km) protect against counter-battery fire with 40km range for

              <p>FH 88 (1988) gets layer's seat!!</p>

              <p><span style="font-family: Verdana;">"<em><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">SAF FH-88, SAF Open House</span></strong></em>" </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Verdana;"><em>The next three
              photos are connected. A rather simplified three-in-a-row shots of FH-88
              fast recovery for redeployment by skeleton crew. The actual setup
              timing to fire the first round was probably classified even though
              everyone know that it falls in around few minutes.</em> </span></p>
              <p><img src="http://storm.webvis.net/scrap414.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="299"></p>
              <p><em><span style="font-family: Verdana;">The second followup
              of the three images. The crew is rigging up the rope to pull the barrel
              back for recovery. If you are aware, the electro-hydraulic actuated
              "legs" are closing up at the same time. </span></em></p>

              <p><em><span style="font-family: Verdana;">The last of the
              three. The long barrel is clearly seen here as the crew are on the way
              to get it back. The development of this accurate gun shocked everyone
              when first introduced. Even though not as famous as the South African
              G-5, this national development enabled us not to rely on any gun
              supplier anymore for a very long time. </span></em></p>
              <p>http://storm.webvis.net/album5.html</p>
              <p><em>The firing mechanism is a mechanical 'trip action' type which is
              actuated either by pulling th<span style="color: #ff0000;">e lanyard </span>or operating the <span style="color: #ff0000;">firing handle</span> at the layer's seat. Primer feeding and extraction is automatic using a
              12-round magazine. A flick rammer is used with power derived from an
              independent power pack.The hydropneumatic recoil mechanism is of the
              independent-type single-recoil system.</em></p>

              <p>sigh lionnoisy.</p>
              <p>are you being stupid or are you just being yourself ? same thing ainnit ?</p>
              <p>dont want to compare FH-88 and M198. simply put : NOT INTERESTED :)</p>
              <p>you mentioned local protection blanket as the solution and shoot and scoot. what happens when i rebutt both ? please lah, dont make me laugh. u dont even understand protection blanket and u wanna trumpet shoot and scoot ?</p>
              <p>must i prove it in hard pictures that you can understand ?</p>
              <p>ok. here's a simple demonstration of why shoot and scoot dosent work especially when you are facing an enemy that has MLRS capabilities.</p>
              <p>for starters, do read up</p>

              <p><span style="font-family: Century Schoolbook; font-size: x-small;">2-21. While
                              technically not missiles, LCRs and MLRSs appear with TBMs in this
                              document because their size, trajectory, warheads, and battlefield
                              targets are similar to those of SRBMs. LCRs are different from SRBMs in
                              that they do not have onboard guidance and, thus, are unguided
                              throughout their flight. Typical LCR systems are the Russian Luna M or
                              free rocket over ground (FROG) series and the U.S. Honest John. MLRSs
                              also lack onboard guidance, overcoming this shortfall by being employed
                              in volleys of a hundred or more rockets on a single target. Typical
                              MLRSs are the <strong>Brazilian Astros</strong>, Russian Smerch, and U.S. MLRS.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Century Schoolbook; font-size: x-small;">2-22. The
                              ability of these systems to deliver</span><span style="font-family: Century Schoolbook; font-size: x-small;"> high volumes of fire and a variety
                              of warheads makes them ideal weapon systems for fire support missions.
                              Highly mobile launchers effectively support forward artillery missions.
                              T<strong>his mobility and the rocket’s short burn time result in little warning
                              for maneuver forces, and their short range precludes engagement by
                              current missile defense systems.</strong> Figure 2-4 illustrates the MLRS
                              characteristics.</span></p>

              <p> <span>Due
                          to its many different warheads, the ASTROS multiple rocket launcher is
                          an ideal offensive weapon system. There are four <strong>warhead variants for
                          the ASTROS launchers: the 32-round SS-30, 16-round SS-40, 4-round SS-60
                          and the 4-round SS-80</strong>. The difference in the variants lie in the weight
                          and size of the rockets they fire. The numbers used in the variants
                          indicate the range of the rockets; for example, the SS-80 has an
                          impressive range of <strong>90km. <br></strong><br>All the variants are high
                          explosive-fragmentation warheads. Prior to an attack, they can be used
                          to shatter enemy defences, allowing the infantry and armour to punch
                          through. The launcher can swamp a target area with more high explosive
                          than several batteries of conventional artillery. <br></span></p>
              Alternative
                              munitions have also been developed. There is a high explosive white
                              phosphorous incendiary warhead, which can be used against enemy
                              personnel and material. <br><br>It can also deploy smoke to conceal an
                              impending attack. There is also a<strong> mine-deploying warhead, which can be
                              used against soldiers and armoured vehicles</strong>. More ominously, the ASTROS
                              system can be used to deliver <strong>chemical agents</strong>, which are far more
                              lethal when delivered at one go rather than when it is steadily built
                              up by a conventional artillery barrage

              <p> ok .. so death by mines, death by chemicals or death by saturation fire ?</p>
