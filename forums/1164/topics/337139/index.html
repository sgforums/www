              <blockquote>
              <p>----the only other ‘Chinook’ air-portable gun system<br> in the 155mm calibre under production.</p>
              <p>---The ‘Pegasus’ is heavier than the M777 (5.4 tonnes versus<br> 3.2 tonnes), because it is fitted with a 21kW Auxiliary Power<br> Unit (APU) providing hydraulic pressure to drive the wheels (at<br> up to 12kph), <span style="color: #ff0000;">operate a powered Ammunition Loading System<br> (ALS), and power the deployment of the system.</span></p>
              <p>-----Similar in concept to the motive system that powers the<br> ‘Mobicon’ container handler system,the ‘Pegasus’ Auxiliary<br> Power Unit needs to be engineered to survive the shock and<br> vibration of gun firing.</p>
              <p><br>----The M777 <span style="color: #ff0000;">achieves many of the Pegasus’ capabilities without<br>the cost and weight</span> of the APU due to its designed-in ‘centre of<br>balance’ and recuperator system.</p>
              <p>---The M777 is balanced on its wheels in travelling configuration<br> so it can be easily controlled and moved. BAES have experimented<br> with using a simple ‘quad bike’ All Terrain Vehicle (ATV) to tow<br> the M777 at low speeds, thus enabling reasonable mobility after<br> rapid deployment by helicopter<span style="color: #ff0000;">.(lion note see (5) below</span>)</p>
              <p>----The advantage of using an All Terrain Vehicle<span style="color: #ff0000;"> compared to the<br> ‘Pegasus’ APU is borne out in much lower acquisition and<br> sustainment costs, as the ATV can be subsequently freed up</span> for<br> other operational uses, such as towing ammunition, after the<br> M777 is positioned.</p>

              <blockquote>A Defence spokesperson has confirmed that the "protected" requirement
                                      calls for a system in which the ordnance must be able to be operated
                                      with the crew under the vehicle's armour.This effectively rules out the
                                      'gun-on-a-truck' offerings of ADI and GIAT with the Caesar; Boeing
                                      Australia and Soltam with the ATMOS; and BAE Systems with the LIMAWS(G)
                                      potee system with the Supacat HMT and M777 gun.</blockquote>
              <p> </p>
              <blockquote>This would require the actual gun to weigh in between 3-6 tonnes,
                                      limiting this contest to 155mm/39 calibre systems and in particular the
                                      BAE Systems M777 and the ST Kinetics Pegasus. Pegasus is fitted with a
                                      unique APU that powers hydrostatic in-hub motors to give the 5.4
                                      tonnegun system a limited, yet important self-propulsion. The APU can
                                      also power anammunition-loading system to increase rate of fire and
                                      reduce operator fatigue.<span style="color: #ff0000;"> While the M777 relies on human power for
                                      mobility and loading</span>, theLIMAWS(G) portee system provides
                                      considerablymore mobility. With crew and ammunition the LIIMAWS(G)
                                      weighs in at 12.3 tonnes and its portee arrangement allows for
                                      flexibility in configuration for airlift.</blockquote>

                              <strong>More on Defence TechX 2008</strong></p>
              <blockquote>
              <p>Mr Teo elaborates on what makes the Pegasus special:</p>
              <ul>
              <li><strong>Auxiliary Power Unit (APU)<br> </strong>It
                                          provides the gun with a short-range self-propelled capability. With the
                                          APU, the system can manoeuvre over terrain at a speed of 12 kmh. Mr Teo
                                          said: "By incorporating this power pack, we allow the Pegasus'
                                          functions to be automated. This is unlike the M777, which is manually
                                          operated by six people on each side of the legs, with brute force.' </li>
              <li><strong>Ammunition Loading System (ALS)<br> </strong>Powered
                                          by the APU, the ALS loads ammunition to alleviate crew fatigue. This
                                          allows the crew to operate the Pegasus longer with a burst rate of
                                          three rounds in 24 seconds. "It's like sticking a bomb into the
                                          barrel," Mr Teo said. </li>
              <li><strong>Innovative recoil management<br> </strong>The
                                          recoil of the Pegasus is a third lower than conventional 155mm
                                          howitzers. "That's how we reduce the overall loading on the gun
                                          structure," he explained. </li>
              <li><strong>Ease of deployment<br> </strong>The
                                          Pegasus is easy to configure. Through a simple seesaw action that
                                          shifts the gun's centre of gravity to suit different missions, it can
                                          be deployed in less than 2.5 minutes with eight men. Mr Teo said: "An
                                          M777, when fired upon, cannot move. But the Pegasus can quickly fold up
                                          and move elsewhere." </li>
              <li><strong>Lightweight materials<br> </strong>The
                                          Pegasus employs lightweight materials like titanium and high-alloy
                                          aluminium that provide the strength and stability required to withstand
                                          the recoil force. "The Pegasus looks totally unconventional. Every
                                          component is multi-tasked," said Mr Teo. </li>

              <p>i believe the phrasing should be take leave of you. and its in the wrong context anyway.  of and from not substitutable or exchangeable</p>

              <p>Wow, lionnoisy just made another wall of text that is next to impossible to understand.</p>
              <p>What is the point of spending so much effort to make posts that nobody can read?</p>
              <p>If your point is to prove that Pegasus is better then M777 to others, then you have most certainly failed in doing that for the simple reason that NO ONE CAN READ your posts.</p>

              <p>Last we checked, Pegasus does NOT carry it's own ammunition load as well. This issue affects the Pegasus as much, so basically you are talking rubbish.</p>
              <p>And in any case a speed of 12kph self-propelled is NOT enough to do shoot and shoot, you'll still be well within the killbox of counterbattery at that speed. If you factor in things like rough terrain and cross-country, you're far better off towed by something more powerful.</p>
              <p>Most of the time the Pegasus' APU is deadweight.</p>

              <p>appreciate the context !</p>
              <p>go look around this forums back pages for the lionnoisy threads. what he has posted here is nothing in comparison to his past jaunts</p>
              <p>stay here long enough and you'd find out how entertaining he is :)</p>
              <p>its not really flaming, its debunking nonsense. go and search all lionnoisy posts and you'd easily come to a conclusion within the first 5-10 posts.</p>
              <p>Lionnoisy is bigoted, unobjective , mono-dimensional thinking and most definitely hates Australia. plus to boot, his command of english is beyond atrocious.</p>
              <p>he's the only person whom ive seen posting in english, and absolutely mangling and defiling it to the point of, emerging as a language only lionnoisy can understand. Absolutely no one else does.</p>
              <p>for instance</p>

              <p>Hmmm what an accusation there.</p>
              <p>Perhaps you could define "flaming" and then bring up some examples of that. </p>
              <p>From what I see, Lionnoisy has made a reputation for himself for self-contradicting arguments, that have pretty dubious claims that are totally unbacked by facts, and have an obvious political leaning.</p>
              <p>As for those cute pictures of toy lions, I don't see how it has been a personal attack on his integrity or person.  They do have captions describing his rather dubious arguments and format.</p>

              <p>here comes the storywolf, with his famous dual-use sense can see and hear my bark at the same time :)</p>
              <p>great timing too. btw ive noticed something a tad too coincidental. when lionnoisy is here, storywolf postings arent too far off behind. and storywolf is just about the only entity that would defend lionnoisy.</p>
              <p>just a coincidence, perhaps ?</p>
              <p>but in any case, let me clarify, i dont hate or dislike lionnoisy. lionnoisy is good entertainment. just sometimes, the humour goes unappreciated because it becomes so bigoted and misleading, it ceases to even exist in the category of crass humour.</p>
              <p>it ventures into the void zone of not funny jokes and was that even a joke kind of humour and sometimes, even into the zone of, wtf was that even a joke ? which necessitates swift and decisive action to ward off the danger of anyone actually becoming convinced by lionnoisy, hence, the Pwnage process.</p>

              <p>The Ultralightweight Field Howitzer (UFH), designated M777 in the USA,
              was selected in <span style="color: #ff0000;">1997 </span>by a joint US Army / Marine Corps initiative to
              replace the existing inventory of M198 155mm towed howitzers. The first
              of five EMD systems was delivered <span style="color: #ff0000;">in June 2000</span>. The US Marine Corps is
              to procure 380 systems and the US Army 273 systems. A low-rate initial
              production (LRIP) contract for 94 systems was awarded in November 2002.</p>

              <p><span style="color: #ffffff;"><br> Singapore Technologies Kinetics selected IDEX 2001 to unveil no fewer than
                    three new weapons - a 155mm/39 calibre Light Weight Self-Propelled
                    Howitzer (LWSPH), an 8 x 8 Armoured Infantry Fighting Vehicle (AIFV) and a
                    new 40mm Air Bursting Munition (ABM) system.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #ffffff;"> </span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #ffffff;">The first 155mm LWSPH technology demonstrator was
                    completed last year and has already fired about 350 rounds of ammunition
                    during trials in South Africa. The system builds on Singapore Technologies
                    Kinetics' experience in the design, development and production of the
                    155mm FH-88 and, more recently, 155mm FH-2000 towed artillery systems.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #ffffff;"> </span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #ffffff;">A key design feature of the 155mm LWSPH was that
                    it could be carried internally in not only a C-130 Hercules aircraft, but
                    also a CH-47 or CH-53 helicopter. The complete system makes extensive use
                    of advanced materials and, without ammunition, weighs only 7,000kg. It
                    takes one minute to come into or be taken out of action. Firing a ERFB BB
                    (Extended Range Full Bore Base Bleed) projectile, a maximum range of 30km
                    can be achieved with a burst rate of fire of three rounds in 15 seconds.</span></p>

              <p>Wow, you're reaching new heights of making unreadable posts. First it was wall of text and now you have upgraded to posting walls of text that are the same colour as the background.</p>
              <blockquote>
              <p>so SG is not  a third class country in producing military hard wares!</p>
              </blockquote>
              <p>Who said that? It's only you with your insecurity that refuses to admit problems that sees the constant need to keep confirming that by claiming things that are not true (first in world, best in this and that) and trying to put down the equipment of other nations.</p>
              <p>Bottom line, we don't care if SG is a third class country in producing military equipment or if it's better then something done but the US or not, we care if there are problems and flaws with the equipment.</p>
              <p>And are there?</p>
              <p>Yes.</p>

              <p>Singapore was rolling out SLWH almost at the same time as M 777!!</p>

              <p>1997-2001</p>
              <p>4 years is NOT almost the same time.</p>
              <p>Also given the Pegasus has a 4 year technological headstart on the M777, how come can't improve on the design significantly?</p>
