              <p>Wow F_N!  Very authoritative statements couched in very
                      strong terms ... except that you seem to be indulging in
                      sensationalistic rhetoric rather than realistic analysis ...<br> <br> "There was a Norwegian mine hunter that was an all composite ship

                      of the salvaged wreck of the HNoMS Orkla ...<br> <br> <img src="http://img152.imageshack.us/img152/8966/korlasalvag5.jpg" alt="Korla Wreck" width="788" height="591"><br> <br> Hardly burnt to an ash is it? <br> <br> The accident report on the fire on the Orkla attributed the fire
                      and resultant sinking to ...</p>
              <ol>
              <li>Poor understanding of Composite ship building requirements and
                      technology by the Norwegian shipbuilding industry.  The Atla
                      Class was the first ever composite ship constructed by Norwegian
                      shipyards.  The fast buildtime between vessels of class meant
                      that no error feedback was obtained to rectify the intrinsic errors
                      in the design that led the fire and sinking.</li>
              <li>Poor maintenance and design in the Lift Fan Room led to the
                      cause of the fire.</li>
              <li>Unprotected flammable soundproofing materials were installed in
                      the LFR, which was classed as a non-fire hazard area.  This
                      provided fuel for the fire to set.</li>
              <li>Failure in the Hydraulics system further flash fed the fire,
                      providing even more fuel for the fire to set.</li>
              <li>Failure to classify the LFR as a fire hazard area also meant
                      that the composite material there was not treated with a flame
                      retardant/protectant.</li>
              <li>Failure of the shipboard fire fighting pumps led to a period of
                      loss of water pressure for ~10mins when the fire fighting was
                      critical.</li>
              <li>Flaw in design of superstructure (lack of reinforcements)
                      contributed to failure of vessel and ultimate sinking.</li>
              </ol>
              <p><br> Quite unlike the simplistic picture painted where if you build a
                      GFRP vessel, heavens help you if it burns.  FYI, almost all
                      MCMVs are pretty much built of GFRP or composites.  Our guys
                      in the Bedok class must be crapping their pants now.  Or are
                      they?  After all, according to the report you so kindly
                      posted, a british minesweeper suffered and engine room fire that
                      blazed for a few hours but didn't sink?  Instead of headlining
                      and sensationalising "Composites are combustible", why didn't you
                      tell us of the incident, just a few pages further?<br> <br> To quote your report ... "Because composites are such good
                      insulators, fires often don’t spread to adjacent compartments. When
                      a British minehunter suffered an engine room fire that lasted
                      several hours, fuel that was in a composite day tank failed to
                      ignite."<br> <br> In reality, composites can be made safer by a variety of treatment
                      and construction methods.  While they may not as good as Steel
                      with regards to Ship Board Fire and Damage Control, the risk may be
                      outweighed by considerable benefits to vessels such as MCMVs and
                      other small, stealth focused vessels.  Besides, there are
                      already plenty of fire &amp; smoke hazards on a ship ... wire
                      cladding materials, POLs, paints, furniture padding, crew personal
                      effects, etc to be just focusing on composites as the root of all
                      evils.<br> <br> On an aside, I think it may be worth considering that the
                      RSN/Mindef/DSTA may have weighed the cost/benefits and decided that
                      ... the better SBF&amp;DC benefits of steel outweigh the stealth
                      benefits of a composite structure.  Rather than that
                      composites are fire hazards and to be avoided at all cost ... after
                      all we do operate 4 Landsort/Bedok MCMVs.</p>

              <p>Obviously you must have missed the part where I mentioned the Visby had a fair number of fire retardation methods to make sure it doesn't catch fire. But yeah, in your bid to find fault in what I wrote, you decided to cherry pick what I wrote. I said it was a bad idea and I stand by it. Not to mention, none of the above fires involved rocket fuel with oxidizers which most anti-ship missiles have and that burns really really hot.</p>
              <p>Also, to nit pick, doesn't "Fire" go out when it has sank into water? The ship burnt a huge hole in the hull and sank before the fire spread across the entire ship. Obviously it wouldn't burn all to ashes. The engine room definitely did reduce itself to nothing.</p>
              <p>It also does not change the fact that composites are combustible ON THEIR OWN. Which is why I mentioned the Visby example and to further expand that, there are water vents at the side of the helicopter hanger to put out any fire due to fuel leaks etc. on the hanger deck.</p>
              <p>And you give too much credit to people working in DSTA to know what the fuck really goes on there and you definitely have no fucking clue as to what goes on there. So shut the fuck up. The only thing what DSTA Is good for is to compare this and that without knowing the technical specifics. If they even need a morsel of help, they have to run to DSO to get an education.</p>
              <p>With regard to the Bedok ship, I will believe it when I see the data reports on</p>
              <p>1. The temperature tolerance of the composite material</p>
              <p>2. How thick is the material</p>
              <p>But wait, I don't think you have those don't you?</p>
              <blockquote> Another bone to pick with you on sensationalising issues.
                      "You do realise that for all that stealth, when the ship is rocking away in uneven waters, or when water is splashing about, the RCS goes up by a few orders of magnitude."
                      You do realise what is an order of magnitude right?  A mutiple of x10.  A Formidable giving a radar return of a fishing boat ... that's about an order of magnitude. 
                      A Formidable going up 1 magnitude, looks like a non-stealthed Formidable. 
                      A Formidable going up 2 magnitudes, looks like an aircraft carrier.
                      A Formidable going up 3 magnitudes, looks like the world's largest Super-Tanker.
                      Since you said "a few" OoM, I'd assume you meant 3 or more OoM.  Really now?
                      I know this is sgforums where a lot of crap gets thrown around.  But really, if you want to sound authoritative, don't sling so much BS lah.
                      Care to tell us what you realy understand about Radar Signals, RCS, RCS-SM issues in high Sea States and how a ships radar return actually gets amplified by a few order of magnitudes in high sea states?  Quite a few people, including myself, are quite interested to know.</blockquote>
              <p>I'm sorry, but obviously I was talking in terms of a hyperbole. It doesn't change the fact that water splashing around increases the RCS. Now, assuming you wish to go continue burning strawmans away, by all means. I'm not interested in talking to an idiot who goes around "sensationalising" issues himself. ALso, it is also obvious you are exaggerating all the above since short of encasing the ship in ice, there's no way the a frigate far less than the size of a Nimitz would ever have an RCS of a Nimitz.</p>

              <p>I think I know what you're getting at now.  That rough seas will bounce the boat around, exposing more of its surface to radar.  Is that right?</p>
              <p>I was not thinking in terms of RCS alone but rather the clutter from rough seas, as well as the already low RCS.  In that, the frigate might still not be easily detected as the operator still has to adjust radar gain to compensate for rougher seas. </p>
              <p>This is a paragraph I found off the net that probably knows more about sea clutter than I do.</p>

              Visby had a fair number of fire retardation methods to make sure it
              doesn't catch fire. But yeah, in your bid to find fault in what I

              idea and I stand by it. Not to mention, none of the above fires
              involved rocket fuel with oxidizers which most anti-ship missiles
              have and that burns really really hot.</p>

              <p>Me Cherry Pick ... ? I beg to differ.  Let's pick apart your entire post shall we?<br><br>You laid out your stand quite succintly, right from the start, by stating that "Actually composites for a ship is a very very bad idea".   When there are actually a lot of ships/boats out there built out of composite materials.  Yes, Fibreglass is a GFRP and a composite.  There are shipping standards for GFRP constructed vessels ... imagine that standards for bad ideas?<br><br>You then sensationalised your claim by pointing out an example of a Norwegian minesweep (Orkla) that "literally burnt itself out into ashes very very fast."  Missing the point totally that the design flaws in the Orkla was what contributed to it burning and sinking.  Not really because it was a composite per se.  Let's not even mention the allusion that the ship burnt into ashes when in reality only a section of the hull was burnt out.  Or that in one of your cited sources, there was an example of a composite minesweeper that survived an engine fire for several hours ... where the properly treated composite material was cited as a factor in containing the fire.<br><br>You then contrasted that with the Visby where the "Swedish put in a lot of effort to make sure the Visby has a lot of fire retardation".  This as a follow on statement to the Orkla which  seems to make it that you are implying that Composite ships have to go through extraordinary lengths to be safe.  FYI, even Aluminum/Steel used in Ship Building have to be fire proofed using intumescent coatings or fire proof insulation.  So what is so extraordinary about composites having to be flame proofed?  Fire proofing of composite materials is a standard process for all composite vessels.  The Orkla suffered from poor design, the Visby is implementing good design ... nothing extraordinary about that.</p>
              <p>In case you try to argue that fire proofing for steel is easier, the USN is dissatisfied with the weight required for fire proof cladding material/blankets for fire proofed steel.  They issued a request for alternatives and noted that current lightweight, spray-on passive flame retardant materials do not work for steel apliques, they work pretty well for GFRP surfaces.</p>
              <p>Then the final non-sequitur, "when it gets hit by a anti-ship missile, all that rocket fuel with oxidizers is simply going to burn the ship up."  All ships regardless of composite/aluminum/steel construct are going to be in trouble if it gets hit by an AShM with leftover fuel.  HMS Sheffield burned merrily despite being an all-steel construct.<br><br>Your second post continues along the same vein,<br><br>Your first line is really a case of the pot calling the kettle black ... "Notice one of the first few lines on the article: Composites are combustible."  What about just a few pages later where an example was cited of the British Minesweeper (HMS Cattistock)?  So who's cherry picking now?<br><br>I'm not even going to go into the rest of the 2nd post.  "Keep the composites out of the superstructure" ... so composites for the engine room is okay now?  After all your cautionary rhetoric of the first post?<br><br>You go around making grand claims in a very authoritative tones, and when called to put up, you backtrack, qualify your statements as being "clearly hyperbole", bluster and get abusive.  Purlease ... sounds like you're a sock puppet for someone.</p>

              water? The ship burnt a huge hole in the hull and sank before the
              fire spread across the entire ship. Obviously it wouldn't burn all

              <p>Yes, composites in raw state can burn .. but so can a lot of materials including all fixtures and fittings (and these are the main fire hazards).  The issue with material safety for shipbuilding is not just combustability but also the materials ability to limit the spread and  prevent growth of the fire.  Untreated steel, likewise, fails in both regards due to the temperature on the backwall going above the flashover point of attached fittings/fixutres.  So steel needs to be treated.  Composties need to be treated.  So untreated composites burning is a be-all and end-all to ship fire safety?  Good thing you don't write building codes.</p>

              <p>R u referring to the radar wavelength band?  </p>
              <p>Shorter wavelengths also suffer from more attenuation to atmosphere, hence the range is also significantly shorter.  Longer wavelengths are less subject to attenuation, but don't have the resolution that shorter wavelengths can offer.  Hence, its back to the same problem thats not all due to the waves, but how the machine displays the return signal as a visual indication to the man.</p>

              <p>Ask and you shall be given ... go download ASM International's Handbook - Vol 21 Composites. It contains 2605 pages of on the various composites used for manufacturing.  You tell me what the composition of the Bedok/Landsort Hull is and you will (most prob) find the specs in there.</p>
              <p>The USN uses a GFRP with a Vinyl Ester Resin (0.25in) with a Balsa Core (3.0in) - total 3.5in.  Kockums Landosrt/Bedok material composition is supposedly a proprietary mix but if you can tell me what it is, I'm sure you can extrapolate from the ASM Handbook.</p>
              <p>For comparison, the 0.25in untreated mild steel typically used in shipbuilding for internal structure has a UL-1709 Back Face temperature (@ 30 min) of ~730 deg C.  It's UL-1709 Time to Failure is &lt;1 minute.  Which is why I said that untreated steel has no fire mitigation property.  An untreated steel wall does not stop the spread of fire, even if it is itself non-combustible.  Make the effort to fireproof steel and you will be putting in as much if not more effort compared to fireproofing composites.</p>
              <p>This is not an argument that composites are more fire proof than steel.  It's just a clarification that Composites are not as bad as you make them out to be.</p>

              <p>cannot leh dude !</p>
              <p>how do we draw a yellow-box then ? no yellow box = no smoke.</p>
              <p>so i conclude that to see smoke from the frigates, we must put yellow boxes around them.</p>
