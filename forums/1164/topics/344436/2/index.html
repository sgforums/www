              <p>i had a feeling we got screwed by DCNS over the formidable class
              when i read december's Defence technology.</p>
              <p>DCNS is marketing a new line of COTs Frigates and smaller sized
              ships. IIRC, the platform series is called Gowind and there are
              several baseline variants with a large frigate down to Marine
              patrol variant.</p>
              <p>http://www.dcnsgroup.com/cen/gowind.html</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>they apparently feature stealth and next gen concepts such as a
              lockgate at the back to launch USVs and recover USVs and RIBs.</p>
              <p>in that sense, they transferred to us technical knowledge and
              know how of a class of warships that (la fayette) they no longer
              intend to build. no real loss to them for transferring old
              stuff.</p>
              <p>but the upside of this trade is, we get 6 frigates for a
              resonable price. access to reduced RCS and low observation
              technology (stealth is stretching it).</p>
              <p>we dont upset the region's status quo too (up north got Leikus,
              we got formidables)</p>
              <p>now imagine how this RCS and low observation technology could go
              into making a new generation MCV or a generation 1.5 LST, and
              possible alternative applications on different platforms (afterall
              , stealth is a matter of design + RAM)</p>

              <p>Well, in the end, we built the remaining vessels. Sure they are better than anything in the region, but the systems we got, well, I think it's possible to develop them any further, barring us paying Thales to do the design work for us. Though I am personally sick and tired of the amount of sucking cock to ST Engineering. Bunch of .. leaches.</p>

              <p>The issue with ST is that they have very little in-house capability to research and develop products. A lot of their products were based on technology they purchased from abroad. Take the drive train of the Terrex. That was purchased from an Irish company. ST is more like some... salesman that goes around selling stuff they didn't invent. Throw in their notorious QC problems for extra kick. Never mind that it is likely the right people don't get credit either. *grumble*</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>As for know how to build stealth ships, very few. It is likely the US and Europeans are pretty good at it, since they are great at material science thus RAM materials. The US of course remains the world leader at it.</p>

              <p>all very true and valid points. but lets look at some other defence projects for example. take a look at the M1 abrams.</p>
              <p>how much of their parts and technology is uniquely american ? the chassis was derived from joint US-german research project to produce a tank (manufactured by chrysler yes, but based on US-german technical cooperation)</p>
              <p>the gun for the M1A2 is a licensed built L44 from KMW.</p>
              <p>truth is, as weapons system become more complex , it not longer seems feasible to construct all components in house.</p>
              <p>just look at the recent 787 / A380 and F35 manufacturing process. they are not even located within a single country but cross continental, global efforts to harness the best possible synergies.</p>
              <p>that being said and done, ST eng is a pretty diverse firm isnt it ? maybe the weapons side (is it ST kinetics ? not sure) has more of a "buy and resell" business model, presenting very little originality and extremely little value add.</p>
              <p>but the other aspects of the conglomerate are pretty solid and strong. ST aviation has a strong solid reputation for good work. ST marine derives most of its revenue from rigs and oil exploration work conversions. in short, a pretty good blue-chip firm with strong fundamentals from non-core defence sectors.</p>
              <p>i m not being pro ST or anything. i do think that they have alot of issues especially with their weapons development (i think the ST kintetics branch basically relies on SAF spending to survive)</p>
              <p>but the fact is that ST's main areas are non-defence related. and they do provide some form of overlap / synergies with defence. Its basically turning to the most efficient solution avaliable since what the SAF wants, ST engineering is able to provide within its various commercial divisions.</p>
              <p>if ST eng were to survive on arms sales alone, ST eng would die. traditionally strong arnaments manufacturers come from countries with large militaries and a strong domestic demand.</p>
              <p> </p>

              <p>yeap. but how many countries posess the technology and are willing to export it pretty liberally in terms of sales ?</p>
              <p>the frogs are known to be indiscriminate with sales , but such indiscriminate sales often comes with a price. America can be pretty stingy with technology when they want to be.</p>
              <p>SG isnt exactly very stringent on Arms exports and whom we sell to as well. just look at the amount of small arms flooding Burma and used by the Junta and the anti Junta rebels.</p>
              <p>in that sense, yeap, we might have obtained ourselves a niche market segment, but nontheless, a segment that gives us a precious foothold to exploit the possible "troubled peace" scenarios that most people envisage for the next 50 years</p>

              <p>below was his speech......is that a heads up.......for Gulf of Aden?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Recently, there has been a surge in the frequency of piracy attacks in the Gulf of Aden and the coast off Somalia. More than 100 ships have been attacked in the past year. The Gulf of Aden is a vital waterway for ships transiting the Red Sea and Suez Canal connecting Asia and Europe. These pirates prey on the global trading system and have raked in an estimated US$120 million dollars in ransom money.(1)<br><br>As a maritime nation, Singapore shares the concerns of the international community regarding the situation in the Gulf of Aden. We fully support the ongoing efforts by both the United Nations and the International Maritime Organisation (IMO) to address the piracy situation there. In 2008, Singapore co-sponsored UN Security Council Resolutions 1838 and 1846, to demonstrate our support for the international community to take greater efforts in the fight against these pirates. Through these resolutions, the Security Council called upon states and regional organisations to act in cooperation with the Somali Transitional Federal Government to fight piracy and armed robbery at sea off the Somali coast, in accordance with relevant international law.</p>

              <p>sgstars is correct that  many major weapons systems contain disparate technologies which are by necessity acquired from many sources.    </p>
              <p>There are numerous  very specialized technologies which are in the hands of individual companies which produce these state of the art equipment. They are leaders in their fields. It is no surprise that major weapons designers incorporate these leading edge equipment into their systems.    </p>
              <p>It is not only ST which does this.  In order to supply the best balance of  equipment suite catered to their customers' requirements, all major weapons suppliers do the same.</p>
              <p>You can be on the leading edge of a particular technology only if you are very specialized. Clearly, ST  is not specialized in any specialised technology and this is not necessarily a bad thing.</p>

              <p>By the way, with regards to that "Laser designating" thread in the other military nuts, a laser designator isn't "coded". It is a Q-Switched laser which is Q-switched at a frequency which the laser seeker, which samples at near -similar rate, can track the laser. This is so that it doesn't track random scattering of light from the background.</p>

              <p>I'm just wondering; shouldn't our ships be able to use datalinks with the RSAF's radar Hawkeyes and their future jet replacements? War isn't a vaccum, after all. :P</p>
              <p>Hmm, I'll just throw in my two cents. I love the Formidables for their modernity, stealthiness, and all, but I can't shake the feeling that we could do better. For example, the Formidables don't have CIWS guns, and will have to depend on the untested Asters if the worst comes to the worst. Only the Europeans use those missiles, mainly because they seem to come as a package with any French/Brit ships. I'm no expert, but missile-on-missile targeting sounds rather dubious; even the Americans haven't got it totally figured out yet. Better to spray bullets as the customers come to the shop as well, eh?</p>
              <p>Also, yes, the French missile launch systems probably aren't capable with foreign tech and future expansion, with the exception of the usual things like Harpoon missiles. It's probably some dastardly French tactic to make sure we buy their upgrades and add-ons.</p>
              <p>Then again, I hope that we've gotten at least <em>some </em>expertise in shipbuilding out of this. Besides, we need these little babies to guard our LSTs, show the flag, to stage naval helicopters out of, and so on. Rather useful buys, these little frigates.</p>

              <p>Heh! That I can agree with.  The truly stealth warship is called a "submarine." =P</p>
              <p>However, at the same time, your requirement for combat management systems, missiles and radar only is not really the best requirement for our type of Navy.  What you've envisioned would have fit perfectly into the fleets of a large ocean-going navy tasked for power projection. </p>
              <p>I'm not totally correct with this, so bear with me.  The best ways to search for surface ships currently is with the use of aircraft with an active naval-search radar.  That way, a large area of water is scanned fairly quickly since the aircraft is operating typically at altitude.</p>
              <p>However, the problem has been the elimination of sea-clutter from the radar returns.  Given various sea-states, the clutter varies.  Hence, detection of vessels with radar also changes.  In order to have a picture that means anything at all, the clutter elimination level has to increased, that is, filtering out signals below a certain strength, and only displaying those above it.  </p>
              <p>The idea of a stealth warship does take advantage of that situation, especially in tropical waters.  If the radar signature is reduced to the level that can be "eliminated" as clutter, the warship is practically invisible to radar unless the operator intends to contend with a more confusing clutter returns.  I think the word I'm looking for such adjustments is "gain."</p>
              <p>Hence, anyone who intends to hunt our ship, has to decide or not whether to contend with more confusing clutter level in order to HOPE to detect one of our frigates, OR set the tolerance level for clutter higher and HOPE that our frigates aren't really around. </p>
              <p>I wish I could find a better picture, but this was the best I could trawl off the net.</p>
              <p><a href="http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/systems/ship/images/cv-67_sps-67_040922-n-1205w-001.jpg">http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/systems/ship/images/cv-67_sps-67_040922-n-1205w-001.jpg</a></p>
              <p>Thats a naval search radar (non airborne) with fairly high clutter levels filtered out.  What if such adjustments were made and it accidentally eliminates the formidable classes from the picture?  </p>

              <p>Stealth also reduces the radar signature for lock-on. That means shooters have to come closer. Its an advantage but not a "end-all".</p>

              <p>Trouble with any jamming is that the inverse square law still works. Barring using a type of jamming that works like a virus (don't ask me whether that works or not. I just hear of it), home on jamming will just home on the source because the source is the most intense.</p>

              <p>Understandably, Malaysia`s MMEA would need more flyable and maritime assets given the breath of maritime and longitudinal space they have to cover. However, my question is how many helicopters do they have ? And how numerically sufficient to cover the maritime borders of Malaysia ? Do you have the figures to lend credence to your argument as I do not know. Thank You.</p>
              <p>The Herakles has a range of 250km(from the manufacturer`s site). Furthemore, they are important nodal points in the net-work centric net of sensors which allow the latter to leverage on other sensors. Why is it that thay cannot detect RCS heavy objects like the helicopters or MPAs first as compared, in your own words, to MK1 eyeball detection system? Under such circumstances, the Formidables would locate the MMEAs helicopters and MPAs first would you not think so? In a war, they are simply dead without help from the navy and airforce.</p>
