If there is a reactor accident on the scale of Chernobyl the radioactive material released will EASILY find its way to Singapore at extremely high levels.<br><br><blockquote>International spread of radioactivity<br><br>A monument to the victims of the Chernobyl disaster at Moscow's Mitino cemetery, where some of the firefighters who battled the flames and later died of radiation exposure are buried.The nuclear meltdown provoked a radioactive cloud which floated over Russia, Belarus, Ukraine and Moldova, but also the European part of Croatia, Turkey, Bulgaria, Greece, Romania, Lithuania, Latvia, Finland, Denmark, Norway, Sweden, Austria, Hungary, the Czech Republic and the Slovak Republic, Slovenia, Poland, Switzerland, Germany, Italy, Ireland, France (including Corsica[15]) and the United Kingdom (UK).[16][17] The initial evidence that a major exhaust of radioactive material was affecting other countries came not from Soviet sources, but from Sweden, where on April 27 workers at the Forsmark Nuclear Power Plant (approximately 1,100 km from the Chernobyl site) were found to have radioactive particles on their clothes.[18] It was Sweden's search for the source of radioactivity, after they had determined there was no leak at the Swedish plant, which led to the first hint of a serious nuclear problem in the western Soviet Union. The rise of radiation levels had at that time already been measured in Finland but a civil service strike delayed the response and publication[19].<br><br>Contamination from the Chernobyl accident was not evenly spread across the surrounding countryside, but scattered irregularly depending on weather conditions. Reports from Soviet and Western scientists indicate that Belarus received about 60% of the contamination that fell on the former Soviet Union. However, the 2006 TORCH report stated that half of the volatile particles had landed outside Ukraine, Belarus and Russia. A large area in Russia south of Bryansk was also contaminated, as were parts of northwestern Ukraine.<br><br>In Western Europe, measures were taken including seemingly arbitrary regulations pertaining to the legality of importation of certain foods but not others. In France some officials stated that the Chernobyl accident had no adverse effects Â– this was ridiculed as pretending that the radioactive cloud had stopped at the German and Italian borders.</blockquote>If the haze from the indons burning their forests can reach Singapore, rest assured the radioactive cloud from any nuclear reactor accident will easily reach us.<br><br>And what money our forefathers save for us?

Let alone walk down the route of having weapons. Even the Pakistanis and Iranians need outside help. These things take many many decades.

It came into operation in 1982 and reached its first criticality on 28 June 1982. TRIGA stands for Training, Research, Isotope Production and General Atomic.<br><br>RTP is a pool type reactor, designed to effectively implement the various fields of basic nuclear science and education. It incorporates facilities for advanced neutron and gamma radiation studies as well as for application, including Neutron Activation Analysis (NAA), Delayed Neutron Activation Analysis (DNA), radioisotope production for medical, industrial and agricultural purposes, Neutron Radiography (NR) and Small Angle Neutron Scattering (SANS).</blockquote><blockquote>Several experimental facilities are available in the reactor:<br><br>Rotary Specimen Rack Facilty is used for activation analysis and isotope production (e.g. Iridium-192 for industry, Phosphorus-32 for agriculture, Iodine-131, Samarium-153 as radiotherapy agents).<br>Pneumatic Transfer System for the production of very short-lived radioisotopes.<br>Central Thimble in the center of the core provides space for the irradiation of samples at the point of maximum flux.<br>Beam Port Facilities provide tubular penetrations through concrete shield and the reactor tank water, making beams of neutron and gamma radiation available for a variety of purposes like NR and SANS.</blockquote>so you guys want me to list what else the malaysian got? i dont know if its a good idea...lionisy already freak out on the PUSPATI TRIGA Reactor ...<br><br>oh what the hell...<br>please note that all facilities listed here are connected directly or indirectly with the reactor.<br><br>1.
