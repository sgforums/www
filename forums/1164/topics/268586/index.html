Malaysia hosted the 7th Forum For Nuclear Cooperation in Asia (FNCA) in the famed Teluk Cempedak beach.<br><br>The high-profile gathering saw senior government officials and top nuclear experts in the region exchanging ideas and information on the effective utilisation of nuclear science and technology.<br><br>Bangladesh, previously an observer, became the newest member of the FNCA grouping this year. The others are Australia, China, Japan, South Korea, the Philippines, Thailand, Vietnam, Indonesia and Malaysia.  ..<br><br>Being an optimist,(Science, Technology and Innovation Minister Datuk Seri Dr Jamaluddin Jarjis) Dr Jamaluddin was quick to scoff at the naysayers, arguing Malaysia needed to, akin to a Malay adage, Â“sediakan payung sebelum hujan.Â” (prepare the umbrella before it rains)<br><br>Â“We cannot afford to sit back and wait for our fossil fuels to deplete before taking action,Â” he reasoned.<br></div><div class="quote_body"> Firstly, Mint has been renamed the Malaysian Nuclear Agency in a move seen as preparing the mindset of the people towards the possibility of a policy shift in the near future.<br><br>Without divulging the cost involved, Dr Jamaluddin said plans were afoot to acquire a 20m megawatts nuclear reactor to replace the one megawatt facility in Bangi.<br><br>The ministry will be seeking a higher allocation under the 10th Malaysia Plan to develop its nuclear energy potential.<br><br>Â“Within the next five to seven years, we should see some results,Â” he said, adding that his ministry was in the midst of bringing together 66 local scientists who are PhD holders in nuclear studies to carry out R &amp; D work in nuclear power.<br><br>Despite these developments, Malaysia still has a long way to go as a reactor of at least 1,200 megawatts is needed to kick start power generation activities. </div></blockquote></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Treaty of the Southeast Asia Nuclear Weapon-Free Zone, December 1995<br><br>Abstract: This treaty was written in affirmation of the necessity of a Southeast Asia Nuclear Weapon-Free Zone in order to realize the Zone of Peace, Freedom and Neutrality advocated in the 1971 ZOPFAN Declaration. It plans for the progressive undertaking of concrete action by ASEAN towards general and complete disarmament, and the upholding of the international non-proliferation system. This treaty allows for nuclear energy to be used for peaceful purposes Â– particularly economic development and social progress Â– on condition of conformity to International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) guidelines and standards.<br><br>These Basic Undertakings, to be binding both inside and outside the Zone, are indicative of the emphasis being placed on establishing shared norms (in this case, of anti-nuclearization) among ASEAN states, not merely common action.<br><br>A number of mechanisms have been put in place to enforce the implementation of the treaty, including allowances for information exchange, clarification and fact-finding missions, as well as a system of controls and safeguards. Cooperation with international organizations is encouraged to facilitate the enforcement of the treaty. The treaty is to remain in force indefinitely, and any partyÂ’s breach of it will give other States the right to withdraw from it.<br>Web link: http://www.aseansec.org/3636.htm</div>

The most recent such development was the establishment of a laboratory for the application of radiation in nanotechnology," he said.<br><br>The lecture was organised by the Academy of Sciences Malaysia as part of the National Nobel Laureates Programme.
