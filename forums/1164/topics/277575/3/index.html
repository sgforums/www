            <div class='col-md body'>Can't really say until we see the real thing.  This really looks like an inert model.<br><br>Actually, i'm more interested in the nature of its warhead.  HEAT, EFP?  Or is it supposed to even shoot tanks at all, or are they just miniature saturation rockets.<br><br>The Jeep platform looks dubious.  But it does suggest that its more of an urban operations weapon for hit n runs.  A-la-Mogadishu technicals but with slightly more punch and sophistication.</div>

Eg. you can't expect them to put it in the tank barrel or arti barrel and the MC  announce the weapon yet the crowd can't see. Another example is like those HY-2 Ashm we see on NK military parade videos, by right they should be in canisters, but for parade sake, they bring it out of canister. Maybe RMA have not officially inducted it, so they are mounted on crude jeeps.<br>I think whether this missile is gd a not is not impt...... It is the strategic impact of this indigenious missiles have on SEA. Remember PRC sold some KS-1A to MY? It is said some MANPADS technology is transferred to MY as part of the deal, so we must be careful as they might have a slight edge in missile techs. PRC might be following the steps of USA back in the 70s, to load the "pawn" states with huge amount of weapons to check their oponents. Eg. is Iran in the 70s  </div></blockquote>yes, u're rite......... the missile mount on the jeep, doesn't mean it will use that platform to launch the missile, it's only for display for the parade only. The missile is still under STRIDE (something likes DSTA) not in MAF yet, that's why we saw they wearing jacket not army uniform.........<br><br>one more thing, MAF is still not operate KS1-A yet..........  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>The "jeeps" are Isuzu Rodeo. They're owned by STride which is something like the DSTA. The 'missiles' is not yet inducted with the MAF. My guesses are:-<br><br>As far as i can see it's some sort of tube launched projectile, maybe artilery launched, certainly not rocket or jet powered. The nose cone looks like an IR transparent materiel, which means most probably it's IR guided, which makes it most probably anti-tank or anti-armour. I cannot see that the "missiles" will be launched from that "jeep".<br><br>The jeeps are owned by the research company, Stride. I'm not sure why they chose that color on the pick-ups.<br><br>PS, in 4X4 Rallying, those Isuzu Rodeos are damn good and tough. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"></div>
