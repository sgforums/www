"Two Tank-Exs will be given to the Army soon for user-evaluation," say sources.<br><br>The Army, on its part, is of course sceptical, having endured the never-ending saga of Arjun, on which DRDO has spent well over Rs 350 crore in development costs alone.<br><br>But DRDO contends that Tank-Ex, which has only undergone "limited technical trials" till now, combines the "strengths" of Arjun and Russian-origin T-72 tanks.<br><br>Tank-Ex has been developed by integrating the modified low-silhouette chassis of the in-service T-72 tanks and the re-engineered turret of Arjun, with its weapon systems like the 120mm rifled gun.<br><br>Capable of attaining a maximum speed of 60 kmph, Tank-Ex weighs just about 47 tonnes, much less than Arjun at 58.5 tonnes and almost equal to the newly-inducted Russian T-90S main-battle tank at 46.5 tonnes.<br><br>That may well be true but induction of tanks and their subsequent upgradation projects have always been a source of worry for the Army, which urgently needs to upgrade the "speed and shock effect" of its mechanised forces. </blockquote><a href="http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/articleshow/1869061.cms&lt;br%20/&gt;" rel="nofollow">http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/articleshow/1869061.cms<br></a><br><br>Finally they admit Arjun is a JUNK, A JUNK...

            <div class='col-md body'>The problem is with the Indian army strategy and not with the tank. The IA strategy is based on the USSR model of large number of light faster tanks taking on smaller number of better tanks. Still this strategy has not changed hence the Arjun did not get its due share in the IA. The IA is inducting around 120 of them.<br><br>Regarding INSAS it is a very good weapon. After that allegation no more allegations by anyone.<br><a href="http://www.india4u.com/india4unews/newsview.asp?ID=672" rel="nofollow">http://www.india4u.com/india4unews/newsview.asp?ID=672</a><br><br>Kathmandu, Aug 14 (IANS) Though Nepal's army blames Indian rifles for its reverses at the hands of Maoist insurgents in midwestern Nepal last week, it owes a recent victory to the same weapon, defence analysts say.<br><br>The Royal Nepalese Army created a furore Friday when its spokesman, Brigadier General Dipak Gurung, alleged at a press conference here that the army lost 43 soldiers at Pili in Kalikot district Aug 7 because the INSAS rifles used by the soldiers malfunctioned.<br><br>The analysts say while Gurung blamed the INSAS for the Pili debacle, he also claimed over 300 Maoists were killed in the battle, which proves the efficacy of the rifles.<br><br>The analysts, who declined to be named, also pointed out that in April the army had inflicted huge losses on the insurgents when they tried to capture an army camp in the rocky Khara area in western Nepal's Rukum district.<br><br>Though Rukum is a rebel stronghold, the army killed nearly 120 outlaws during the attack while over 70 wounded guerrillas were said to have died later trying to get medical treatment.<br><br>During the Khara battle, the army had used INSAS rifles. Though the attack lasted for nearly 15 hours, the rifles did not get heated or malfunction.<br><br>A team of experts, including P.K. Agarwal, additional general manager of the rifle factory in India that manufactures the weapons, visited Nepal to teach the Nepalese army how to fire and maintain the guns.<br><br>It was found that some of the guns did not fire because the soldiers had not wiped off the grease the factory had coated them with to prevent rust. The team test-fired 400 rounds continuously during the demonstration without hitch.</div>

The Maoist rebels are only as well-armed as the Nepali Army - probably worst. And yet the rebels scored so many victories.</div>

Type81 and Type 56 r both CHinese make-AK-47...
