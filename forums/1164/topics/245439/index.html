            <div class='col-md body'><span style="color: blue;">Sri Lanka main Air base was bombed by tiny LTTE "airforce" on Monday and now initial investigation report is out...</span><br><br><a href="http://www.sibernews.com/news/sri-lanka/-200703287935/" rel="nofollow"><strong>Sri Lanka: Faulty radar helped Tamil Eelam Air Force?</strong></a><br><br><blockquote>...<br><br>Initial investigations revealed that the first generation radar installed by India failed to detect the incoming aircraft until the radar at the adjacent Bandaranaike International Airport identified them.<br><br>"The detection was made as the aircraft were about 3 kms off the airbase," a senior defence official said.<br><br>Had the SLAF radar spotted the intruders, the outcome of MondayÂ’s encounter would have been different, he said.<br><br>Before the detection by BIA radar, the SLAF had received information about the LTTE aircraft crossing the northern-line-of-control through ground based sources. But the intended target was not specified until the BIA radar picked the enemy craft approaching the airbase.<br><br>The government on Monday discussed ways and means of meeting the new threat. The Island learns that that the government raised the issue with the Indian High Commission on Monday. Sri Lankan officials are believed to have explained the urgent need to fully activate the existing system.<br><br>Although three of the four radars promised by India are in place, there are believed to be operational problems. The fourth is likely to be installed in the northern theatre. Sri Lanka wants India to fully activate the system on a priority basis.<br><br>India stepped in with an offer to establish a radar network after President Chandrika KumaratungaÂ’s government initiated talks with China to acquire a 3D radar system. Former Indian High Commissioner Nirupama Rao, currently New DelhiÂ’s top envoy is believed to have initiated the move on behalf of her government as India had national security concerns.<br><br>The Island learns that President Mahinda Rajapakse is likely to seek a meeting with RaoÂ’s successor Alok Prasad in this regard. The unprecedented attack has prompted the government to review the existing counter measures on a priority basis.<br><br>President Rajapakse called an urgent meeting with political party leaders to brief them of the current situation.<br><br>Although the LTTE scored a huge propaganda victory, LTTE aircraft failed to hit the intended targets-Israeli built Kfirs and Ukrainian MIG 27s. SLAF headquarters said that two of the three bombs dropped by the LTTE exploded causing damages to three buildings.<br><br>Pro-LTTE TamilNet quoted unnamed airmen as saying that several SLAF jet bombers were put out of action by fierce fires which broke out in the hangars struck by the LTTE aircraft. Up to 40% of the SLAFÂ’s strike capability has been knocked out, the website reported.<br><br>SLAF headquarters yesterday emphasised that the LTTE attack did not dent its strike capability. "All Kfirs and the newly acquired MIG 27s are safe," an official said. "They missed their targets," he said, adding, "We would continue to take targets depending on the requirement."<br><br>Kfirs and MIG 27s launched from Katunayake engaged five LTTE targets on Monday afternoon and yesterday.<br><br>Aircraft targeted LTTE positions north of Mannar, Mullaitivu, Kanagarayankulam and South of Thoppigala. The SLAF said that an LTTE intelligence base and a Sea Tiger facility were among the targets taken.<br><br>A senior government official yesterday contradicted B. Raman, former head of Research and Analysis Wing who claimed that the LTTE air wing had been in existence for nine years without the Sri Lankan intelligence having the least idea about its location and capability.<br><br>Raman, a former Additional Secretary of the Cabinet of India made the declaration hours after the terrorist attack. Sri Lankan sources pointed out the absurdity in RamanÂ’s assertion. He conveniently ignored that India installed radars after Sri Lanka sought to deploy an advanced Chinese early warning system.<br><br>The sources emphasized that Sri Lanka sought the Chinese help after obtaining credible information about the existence of the LTTE air wing. The sources revealed that Sri Lanka also briefed permanent members of the UN Security Council plus India of the growing threat posed by the LTTE air wing in early 2005. In fact, a comprehensive dossier which included even a short footage obtained by Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) of the Â‘LTTE assetsÂ’ was made available to the big five-US, Russia, China, UK and France and India. The sources said that this was done at the highest level as Foreign Minister Lakshman Kadirgamar correctly assessed the threat. According to a senior official Sri LankaÂ’s action was in line with US Security Council Resolution 1373.<br><br>In the wake of the 11 September 2001 Al Qaeda attack in the US, the UN Security Council unanimously adopted resolution 1373, which, among its provisions, obliges all States to criminalize assistance for terrorist activities, deny financial support and safe haven to terrorists and share information about groups planning terrorist attacks.<br><br>The 15-member Counter-Terrorism Committee (CTC) was established at the same time to monitor implementation of the resolution. While the ultimate aim of the Committee is to increase the ability of States to fight terrorism, it is not a sanctions body nor does it maintain a list of terrorist organizations or individuals.<br><br>Sri Lanka believes that LTTE is in pocession of a few aircraft possibly Pilatus PC-7, Pilatus PC-21 and Zlin Z 143. The sources said that India was the first to receive the dossier on the LTTE attempts to build an air wing.<br></blockquote></div>

There's still alot of answers that had yet to be addressed for this successful LTTE air-raid.<br><br>The Sri Lankan military was caught with their pants down this time and naturally finger-pointing is conveniently pointed at India over this debacle (sounds familiar?  Remember GEN Sonthi remarks at S'pore?).<br><br>Given the air superiority enjoyed by the SLAF, it would be pure suicidal for the Air Tigers (with their single-engined pleasure-craft) to venture into the air under broad daylight!  Therefore it is natural that the LTTE single-engined craft flew at low-level and at night.<br><br>Now, there are claims and fears that the LTTE pilots had NVGs (whereas the SLAF pilots did not) during the attack.  But come to think of it, the craft must be flying just above the tree-tops and the LTTE pilots could thus navigate their way by the terrain and using a simple compass and the bright lights of the airbase to home in and one don't need a TOP GUN-trained pilot to do that!<br><br>Now I'm not versed in electronics nor radar tech, but I believed the Indian-supply AD radar must be scanning the horizon and the LTTE plane must had flew under the radar (remember what I said about the navigation part?).<br><br>As the facts of this raid is still being examine, let's not jump to conclusions.  Mind you, the SLAF possesses the MiG-27 and years before, there were many fatalities of this jet during low-level attack runs and it was found that SLAF pilots were being rushed to fly this fast jet w/o proper training.  Thus is the MiG-27 at fault then?<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I wonÂ’t say much. Please note the LTTEÂ’s farm planes were picked up by CIVIL RADAR in a nearby international airport when they were just 3 kms away from their target: the Sri-Lankan main airbase.  So I donÂ’t think the pilotÂ’s skill played a much important role in this raid.<br><br>As a matter of fact, Sri-Lankan forces were aware of LTTEÂ’s threat from air beforehand, even when the farmplanes just took off, the authority had already been briefed that an air strike was coming, yet, as a main military base in war time, they lacked the minimum and proper facility to even look out their known threats. What a pity.<br><br>Just image any RSAF airbase doesnÂ’t operate radar for early warning or always down for repairing. WhatÂ’s your reaction?<br></div>
