            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by HENG@:</div><div class="quote_body">excecuting an unarmed wounded man is a no no. The Marines r pros who r supposed to BEHAVE like pros, not engage in such acts of massacre. stooping to their level makes it that much harder to take the moral high ground</div></blockquote>Sorry, Heng, but IMHO you called it wrong here.<br><br>The area had been cleared, but it had then been reoccupied by insurgents - it would not have been sound to assume that the area was safe and that the wounded were still unarmed.<br><br>Also, the definition of "armed" isn't restricted to firearms, is it?  The wounded soldier could have decided to have his bit of glory and be a suicide bomber - not an unrealistic scenario in those parts.  From the image posted in this thread, there's no way of telling if the wounded soldier was covering an explosive device.<br><br>Given the circumstances, especially vis-a-vis the "false white flag" technique, the situation does provide mitigating circumstances.  While the My Lai comparison is inappropriate, this situation may be compared to the German use of the "false white flag" technique in WW2 - after a while, the Allies learned to disregard the white flag and were it was never held against them - the common sense of their approach prevailed.<br><br>If the other guys want to use the white flag for deception, they've got no business bleating about it (or anyone on their behalf) when it turns around and bites them in the ass.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Just picked this up from another forum:<br><br>"In the south of Fallujah yesterday, U.S. Marines found the armless, legless body of a blonde woman, her throat slashed and her entrails cut out. Benjamin Finnell, a hospital apprentice with the U.S. Navy Corps, said that she had been dead for a while, but at that location for only a day or two. The woman was wearing a blue dress; her face had been disfigured. It was unclear if the remains were the body of the Irish-born aid worker Margaret Hassan, 59, or of Teresa Borcz, 54, a Pole abducted two weeks ago. Both were married to Iraqis and held Iraqi citizenship; both were kidnapped in Baghdad last month."<br><br>Mind you, Margaret Hassan was there to help the Iraqi people.  Let's see - who were the brutal ones again.....?</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Why the media seems to focus on the marine that shot the Iraqi and debate whether he's right or wrong to shoot. Why not ask the media crew who shot the video. Ask him to exchange his gear with the marine's weapon and other gear... put the camera man in the room with 3 iraqis who seems to be wounded... reminding him that his platoon mates had been fatally shot at while they approached from their cover, towards 4 iraqis waving the white flag.... to be greeted by AK-47 fire...<br>then ask the camera man what  will he do in that situation..??<br><br>Its easy to condamn the marine who shot the iraqi... but it isn't easy to react in his given situation at that time.... As another forumite had pointed out, the Geneva conventation cover the uniformed cambatants... but not Terrorists, who kill ( civillians ) at will. Those who are fighting against the Marines, better know what to expect. I'm behind the marine, though he may not be justified ( at that pt of insufficient intel as to whether the iraqi is armed or booby trapped ) in shooting. All the marine did is to protect his life, and the lives of his platoon mates against scheming terrorists who might had booby trapped the body...<br></div>
