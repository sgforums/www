Ruggedness, ease of operation and cost-effectiveness have systematically been given top priority. When operating, the 105 LG1 Mk II demonstrates unrivalled reliability, mobility, manoeuvrability and firepower. It is the ideal fire support weapon for troops active in all climates, even over the harshest terrain.<br><br>The 30-calibre 105 mm barrel is capable of firing all types of NATO standard ammunition (12 rds / min), including long range US M 913 / ERM1.

Its simple manning allows a reduced 5-man gun crew.</strong><br><br>According to Janes , this gun could be ready to fire within 30 sec after been deployed by a Helo and ready to be towed away by a light 4x4 in 30 sec or helo borne again .<br><br><img src="http://www.ravenshield-fr.com/images/RS_animation4.gif"></div>

Total weight is about 4tons, thus can be airlifted by heavy helos, CH53, CH-47Chinook. Same category as our LWSPH, but need to be towed by trucks instead.</div>
