            <div class='col-md body'>Talking about this topic relating to the latest in 3D warfare battle management.<br><br>Ever wondered why the sensor packages are grouped accordingly,<br>meaning...<br><br>- radar for air and surface threats<br>- sonar for underwater threats<br><br>The term 'surface' means anything just in the positive vertical direction above sea level, for radar to detect something like a ship or even a sea-skimming missile if possible (not withstanding problem of radar clutter at sea)<br><br>But, there is no sensor for 'anything <strong>just</strong> in the <strong>negative</strong> vertical direction <strong>beneath</strong> sea-level'.  There is supposed to be another blind or dead zone in this region which sonar would be har-pressed if not impossible to detect anything other than wave motion etc.<br><br>This could be a very critical area to exploit in terms of attack methods against surface vessels - e.g. wave-riding weapons ?<br><br>Hope this is being understood and done with by the local military/navy guys....</div>

Diversions could be made to draw all visual detection away from the direction of attack.  The dinghy is deployed right 'under the nose' of the radar coverage.  All this could happen within 2 minutes.  The alert response rate onboard the vessel may not be quick enough under normal conditions.  The vessel can't possibly refrain from standing off all nearby vessels.<br><br>A sidetrack...countermeasures against boarding teams....this method could be used as decoy against fast approaching boarding vessels...when the suspected vessel is 'inadvertently' overtaken and forcibly boarded, the explosives could be deployed against the interceptor vessel alongside broadsides, destroying the boarding party in the process.</div>
