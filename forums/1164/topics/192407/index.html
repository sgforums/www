            <div class='col-md body'>Russia will definitely take some time before regaining back its Superpower status if this is still ever possible. This is because Asian powers such as China and India are progressing rapidly too. But it will be good news to have another Super power to balance the USA, otherwise they might want to bypass the UN and ignore the international community again in the future to carry on unilaterally such as in the case of Iraq. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by dragg:</div><div class="quote_body">russia do not have the financial muscle anymore.<br><br></div></blockquote>They are making lot with all the oil they are currently exporting. heck they practically have a monopoly on providing oil to europe!!! And with China and Japan fighting for Russian oil too......They sure arent going to stay poor!<br><br>Russia still has alot of high tech ideas and R&amp;D however no money to pursue them. And it's selling everything it has! Well almost. I think it'd take some time.....but i expect them to rise again. As for China? hmm......i highly doubt they can become a super power. To many natrual enemies around and to many people in the country to feed,take care off and it's economy is too export based. But China will become a world power....i'm just now sure very super. And not very soon</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>That I believe other wise... Russia economy substain mainly on the oil... not its technology or other produce. A economy like that had never as yet seen being able to be a super power... To be a super power you need to have alot of things. which includes infrastructure and industry and related economies... Russian have only snows... Where as China basically have every... including oil... The reasons for the purchase of oil is purely to fuel the expansion... China relies on export true but the basic industry now only soon grow into mroe advance industry which creates economies, industry and infrastructure suitable for a superpower just like the USA. In facts many experts all agreed that China alone will soon overtake EU and eventually the USA by 2015 as the world no.1 in economy... Remenber the fact that who has the money... who will be strong. It applies here... China if she is the biggest economy in the world do you think she has no money for a few more military gardget? Not a very unlikely situation. By 2008 onwards you will see the world changes and once again the dragon has risen.<br><br>Whereas the military technology of the Russia... I think it is best described by a Chinese general during a conversation with MM  Lee KY. Mr.  Lee asked him why is China sending talents to russia and buying arms from Russia... and not the others? (a rough reenactment ) The general replied... Its a myth that Russia is a poor country therefore doesn't have good technology.... But instead Russia has one of the best technology because the fact that Russia spend too much money on Research therefore she has not enough money to substain a huge military. I think this tells best about Russia's arms. They don't known as one of the best for no reasons.</div>
