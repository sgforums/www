              <blockquote>WASHINGTON - AT 8AM every day, the White House receives the so-called Threat Matrix.This
              is a highly classified status report beamed from the National
              Counterterrorism Centre (NCTC), the electronic hub of the US
              intelligence community and a vital part of its security infrastructure</blockquote><blockquote>.Established
              by President George W. Bush after the 9/11 terrorist attacks, the NCTC
              is manned 24/7 by officers and analysts from all 16 agencies of the US
              intelligence community as well as private sector contract employees.</blockquote><blockquote> In
              fact, more than half the people running the centre, located at an
              unmarked office complex in northern Virginia, work for dozens of
              different big and small companies.The NCTC control room itself -
              loaded with sophisticated communications and computer gear - is
              designed by engineers from Walt Disney Imagineering, whose main
              business is developing theme parks.Sensitive intelligence tasks
              traditionally performed by government employees working for the Central
              Intelligence Agency (CIA), the <span id="hitDiv2">National</span> <span id="hitDiv2">Security</span> <span id="hitDiv2">Agency</span>, the Pentagon and others are now being routinely farmed out.</blockquote><blockquote>'Spying
              for hire has become a way of life in 21st century America,' said a new
              book documenting the trend with eye-opening details:<span style="color: #ff0000;">The number
              of contract employees at the CIA, for example, now exceeds its
              full-time workforce of 17,500.</span> The CIA now has its own investment fund,
              called In-Q-Tel, which buys equity in companies that produce software
              and other products with intelligence operations.Substantial
              portions of the President's Daily Brief (PDB) are based on the work of
              private sector analysts. </blockquote><blockquote>'For full disclosure,' said intelligence
              expert and blogger R.J. Hillhouse, 'the PDB really should look more
              like Nascar with corporate logos plastered all over it.'Put
              together, it is an astounding amount and range of operations - from
              interrogations to tracking Al-Qaeda operatives - that are outsourced.<span style="color: #ff0000;">The
              outsourcing amounted to over 70 per cent of the estimated $60US billion
              ($82S billion) intelligence budget in 2006, said Mr Tim Shorrock,</span></blockquote><blockquote> the
              writer of<span style="color: #ff0000;"><em><strong> Spies For Hire: The Secret World Of Intelligence Outsourcing</strong></em></span>.The
              market, which Mr Shorrock reckoned is now worth $50US billion a year,
              is serviced by major defence contractors such as Lockheed Martin as
              well as small, venture capital-funded technology shops.The trend
              has raised concerns, such as over the fact that there are no standards
              determining which activities should be farmed out, said Mr Shorrock, an
              investigative reporter.Whether a task like interrogation should
              be outsourced is hotly debated, especially after it emerged that
              civilian contractors were involved in some of the horrendous torture
              and abuse at the Abu Ghraib prison </blockquote><blockquote>in Iraq.In fact, some top Pentagon aides have openly admitted that they have no idea how much outsourcing is going on.Also,
              there is little congressional oversight of the process, Mr Shorrock
              said while discussing his book at the Washington-based Institute of
              Policy Studies on Monday.Not all find the outsourcing worrisome.'The
              fact that we can have a professional intelligence organisation outside
              of the government to support the government is no more offensive to me
              than the fact that we have 80 per cent of our military communications
              travelling on commercial satellites,' retired Vice-Admiral Herbert
              Browne was quoted as saying in the book.'I find it very healthy for the nation,' added Admiral Browne, who left the military to join a defence division of <span id="hitDiv3">AT</span>&amp;<span id="hitDiv3">T</span>.</blockquote>
