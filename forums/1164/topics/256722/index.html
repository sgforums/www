            <div class='col-md body'>Indonesians were lucky in the Confrontation.....there were plans to nuke them if they had escalated the conflict.<br><br>==============================<br>from:<br><a href="http://users.qld.chariot.net.au/~dialabull/Indonesia-Malaysia%20Confrontation.htm" rel="nofollow">http://users.qld.chariot.net.au/~dialabull/Indonesia-Malaysia%20Confrontation.htm</a><br><br>By 1960 the RAF was involved in drawing up nuclear targeting plans for SEATO and had made plans to move 48 Red Beard tactical nuclear weapons to Tengah in 1962. Three squadrons of V-bombers would be based there, capable of dropping Red Beard weapons from high altitude, together with one squadron of smaller Canberra aircraft, which would use a low-altitude bombing system, or "toss bombing" tactic.<br><br>British Vulcan (V-bombers) were never sent permanently to the Far East. Instead, four to eight were dispatched to Tengah, Singapore and RAAF Butterworth, Malaya between 1963 and 1966 during the "confrontation" between Malaysia and Indonesia. These aircraft would have been tasked, if the confrontation had escalated, with conventional bombing of Indonesian airfields to begin with. Nuclear bombs would only be used as a last resort. In addition, the Canberra squadron at Tengah began low-altitude nuclear bombing exercises at the end of 1963. This squadron remained in the Far East until 1970, although it is not clear that it necessarily remained nuclear equipped. The British government decided that any further escalation by the Indonesians would result in British Vulcan bombers conducting raids against Indonesian targets using RAAF Base Darwin as their operating base, but there is no evidence that any of the 48 nuclear bombs were moved to Darwin. During confrontation only one raid by two Victor-bombers took place against Indonesia........<br><br>===============================<br><br>Stupid Indons- Look at them today, the politicians are still spoiling for a fight.... not knowing Singapore is much stronger than them, even without the nuclear option. If we had a mad govt, they would be finished.....<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>SG may have qualitative military edge, but Indon has over 200 million people, over 3/4 muslims. Current world situation makes any conflict very likely for some on the other side to escalate and use the word 'jihad' on us. When that happens, military superiority may be useless (look at US in Iraq now).<br>Some regional observers say the Indon military is S'pore's best hope of forming a longer-lasting peaceful co-existence with Indon, since most of the political parties don't agree with us or don't last. My guess is: SG's logic is since the current President is ex-military, they should forge even stronger closer military relationship w/ Indon, maybe try to keep him there as long as possible. For all the bad things Suharto (he's ex-military too) did, we had our best times with Indo when he was in power.</div>

The Australian have help Indo in humanitarian aspect but i don't know of any military technical help to the indo. I think their viewed is simple and realistic that they have a huge coast line to defend and it is facing indo. So I think Aus does not feel secure to help Indo military as yet.<br><br>I think we also have to understand that If something happen between Indo n aussie, and the Aussie are busy defending the coastline than it would impact its resources for oversea deployment.

            <div class='col-md body'>Since Indonesia has declared economic war on Singapore, Singapore should retaliate, otherwise they will see Singapore as impotent and 'good to eat'.<br><br>how to retaliate? Fight with what would hurt them economically.......the price of rice, cooking oil, and commodities. We should manipulate the market to push all these prices up, so that the Indonesian people would be discontented with their govt, and rise up in arms..................hopefully they would fragment, and we support those who would be friendly to us towards independance from the Javanese ..........<br><br>If there are Indonesians reading this........good......I say to you...... your govt's actions has hurt us and we will fight back.........<br><br>....you bite the hand that fed you during the Tsunami.....while my Minister Mentor tried to make the Batam Economic zone a success, you suddenly ban sand exports the very next day.

THey have suffered terribly under the Indonesian's reign of murder and torture for very long.<br><br>And like someone - moca? - pointed out on this forum... the tsunami rescue effort demonstrated how quickly and smoothly SAF can mobilise a major overseas military operations within 48 hours.<br><br>Stupidly, we did help the Indonesians duing the flood recently.<br><br>That our military can cream these backwards states is quite certain. SO I don't see why PAP continue to kowtow to their 2-bit aunty politicians, half-wit leaders etc...</div>
