We are short of manpower and yet the non-combat roles are filled with able-bodied young men.<br><br>To begin with, Battalion HQ is filled with combat fit personnel. This job can be easily done by older reservists who have vast experience in this area. Then the Battalion QM and Medical Centre can similarly make use of this untapped manpower. These guys may only leave camp to deliver supplies and food. Definitely non-combat. Send all the storemen and medical centre personnel back to company line and give them a weapon.<br><br>This is only the tip of the iceberg. As you go into the Signal Corps, Armour, Air Force etc... you can put in all these older men with vast experience that can take up the non-combat roles.<br><br>As you well know, every modern army is something like 40% combat troops supported by 60% non-combat personnel. If we can release half of that 60% into combat roles, think of how many more battalions we can create!</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I'm pretty sure if you really wanted to continue after your 13 year cycle, MINDEF won't reject you, even if you aren't an officer. Actually, your unit, which I assume you would have built up a good relationship with coz of your positive attitude, won't turn you away. They'll be able to make the necessary recommendations and requests to MINDEF. There's always a back-door in if you're enthusiastic. That's one thing I've learnt.<br><br>The problem is, people like you are the exception, not the norm. Most of the reservist I've worked with can't wait for their cycle to end!</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I would volunteer to return to my former unit (hahaha, if they need me)  if there is a crisis. But I may not necessarily volunteer for ICT each year. Need to balance my career and family and hobbies now.  There are many other ways to contribute to Singapore's defence.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by tvdog:</div><div class="quote_body">There are many men in their late 40's or 50's whom have finished serving NS and still in considerably good healthy condition.<br><br>After so many years of valuable military training plus their own life experience these men can continue to be very useful to SAF.<br><br>Some of these men may actually want to continue serving in a reduced capacity in SAF.<br><br>So should SAF start a programme where these men can volunteer to continue to serve yearly ICTs?<br><br>One way is to start a Home Guards Division where these older men can be like a last line of defense or help police provide armed security for civilian areas in wartime. Or these men can be trained to operate light AA weapons. During WW2 England had the Home Guards made of men either too old or unfit to be in the regular army.<br><br>Another way is to let these men remain in their unit in admin or other non-combat posts like armskoteman, armourer, QM, weapons instructors etc. This would relieve a lot of younger men so they can go out to the field instead of languishing in the camp.</div></blockquote>There is already men that are for Home Defense... the PDF lor.<br><br>And light AA is not so easy to operate. And you need training in IFF also. What if you shoot down your own F16s??<br><br>In a hi-tech world, "manpower" as in headcount is less important compared to having hi-tech assets and having "highly-trained" manpower to operate them.<br><br>Currently, in my unit, already got "downgraded" combat-voc personnel serving in such service roles like QM and so on.....<br><br>Also many of the support/service roles are filled by men that are not fully combat fit. so having their jobs done by other people will not free them up for frontline service.<br><br>But overall, I think it is good idea for these Uncles to continue to serve if they want to. but for a military to suceed, they have to have obligations..... these volunteerign basis will not work....<br><br>if i activate my "uncle" platoon, how many men will turn up if it is stricly volunteer....<br><br>so basically if they want to "volunteer", they have to commit for a certain "duration" like 3 years... and the entire group can serve as a "unit" for 3 years.<br><br>After 3 years when their "term" is up, those that "re-enlist" will continue another 3 years...<br><br>During training they will take on roles similar to PDF as in protection of key installation etc.... And during war time will be deployed accordingly.<br><br>I feel that if they form this, the unit's morale and motivation should be very high... since they are all "volunteers"! but then the downside is that these men didn't serve together in a unit during their active years so the espirt de corps might not be high.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Right on.<br><br>And there are very examples of older men in service during WW2 mostly among the European partisans.<br><br>Also during 1967 in Israel, the combined Arab armies of Egypt, Jordan, Syria and Iraq wanted to destroy Israel once and for all.<br><br>Many Israeli past their service age showed up for mobilisation calls and demanded to be allowed to fight. Many were veterans of previous wars. They were accepted and given arms, I can't remember though if they joined other units or formed a home guard unit. Likely the latter.<br><br>During that time just about every one volunteered. Bus drivers in Israel contributed their bus and their service as bus drivers to ferry troops to the frontline. Housewives made food for passing troops etc.<br><br>Old Palestinian men with Lee-Enfield rifles and younger teens with Sten Guns defended their own villages against the Jews.<br><br>Sadly, the Israelis committed a lot of massacres on the Arab civilians in the territories they captured.<br><br>So it goes to show: why sit and wait for the enemy to come and slaughter you and your family? The reason I say volunteer to continue service is so that when that eventuality comes, you still know how to operate as a fighting man.</div>
