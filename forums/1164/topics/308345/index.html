              <p><strong>Air Force Unit 684</strong><br> <br> On January 21th, 1968. North Korean Army 124th unit sent 31 armed spies to the South to kill the then S. Korean <br> president(military dictator) Park Jung Hee. but they were failed, 30 was killed and 1 was captured.<br> <br> on April, 1968, President Park ordered to form special unit to kill N.
                                  Korean dictator Kim Il Sung. Chief of Centeral Intelligence
                                  Agency(KCIA) founded that unit under Air Force in Island Silmi near
                                  Inchon city. the name was unit 684 cause it was founded in '68 and
                                  April(4). It was for revenge and exact 31 members were there.<br> <br> 7 members were dead during training. 1 was drowned, 1 was killed from
                                  raping other members by platoon leader, 2 was killed from escaping the
                                  unit by platoon learder, 3 was killed from raping civilian woman by
                                  platoon learder.<br> <br> the problem was they'd never sent to the N. Korea to kill KJI cause
                                  there was peace mood between South and North. in 3 years and 4 month
                                  after foundation of that unit, 23 trainees killed platoon leaders,
                                  instructors and headed to capital city Seoul, to the Blue House to meet
                                  President Park to demand sending them to the North on a bus armed with
                                  rifles and hand grenades <br> <br> 17 was killed by Army unit soldiers on a that bus, 2 DOA, 4 was executed after Court Martial. <br> <br> the then best irregular warfare unit soldiers was dead for nothing. If
                                  they were sent to the North, King Jung Il were deadman walking.</p>

              <p>http://web.archive.org/web/20060513162442/http://times.hankooki.com/lpage/nation/200402/kt2004020617442611960.htm</p>
              <p><span>By Ryu Jin<br> Staff Reporter</span></p>
              <p><span>With hundreds of thousands of South Koreans
              enthused by the recently released domestic film ``Silmido,ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ military
              authorities on Friday confirmed for the first time the existence of
              ``Unit 684,ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ a secret unit of agents who were trained for the
              assassination of then-North Korean leader Kim Il-sung in late 1960s. </span></p>
              <p><span>The Defense Ministry said the unit in question is
              a detachment of the ROK Air Forceï¿½ï¿½s Squadron 2325, which recruited 31
              civilians for special missions on April 1, 1968.</span></p>
              <p><span>``Seven of them died in training, 20 were killed
              in a rebellion and the four survivors were put to death after military
              trial,ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ ministry spokesman Brig. Gen. Nam Dae-youn said in a press
              briefing.</span></p>
              <p><span>Nam added the ministry found five out of the
              seven men from a village of Okchon, North Chungchong Province, who
              altogether went missing around the time, had identical names with five
              of the 31 unit members. ``We cannot confirm if the five are the same
              people that were members of the unit, because most of records were
              destroyed. We will have to check further,ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ he said.</span></p>
              <p><span>Keen public attention was drawn to Unit 684 and
              the Silmido incident as a movie, portraying the fate of 31 unit members
              in rebellion, was released late last year.</span></p>
              <p><span>The unit was launched in retaliation against a
              North Korean attempt to assassinate South Korean president Park
              Chung-hee in 1968. On Jan. 21, 1968, 31 North Korean agents sneaked
              into Seoul on a mission to assassinate then-president Park Chung-hee.
              They almost reached Chong Wa Dae, but most of them were killed in the
              mountains surrounding the presidential residence.</span></p>
              <p><span>The number of the unit, 684, stands for the
              April, 1968 when the unit was founded. The members were trained harshly
              on a remote, deserted island in the West Sea called Silmido.</span></p>
              <p><span>The identities of those 31 figures and how they
              joined the unit are not known, though the movie described them as
              condemned criminals.</span></p>
              <p><span>The unit was ready by 1969 for its infiltration
              mission into Pyongyang, but by that time relations between the two
              rival Koreas had thawed somewhat, and Seoul reconsidered its
              assassination plans. The unit members were left isolated on the island,
              unable to leave, for about three years in conditions described in the
              film as inhumane.</span></p>
              <p><span>In August of 1971, unit members rose to kill
              their overseers and made their way to Chong Wa Dae in rebellion. Most
              of them, however, committed suicide with their grenades when confronted
              with troops in Seoul.</span></p>
