In any nuclear exchange, Singapore will at most lost 4 million men while multiple shots from us will devastate up to 10 fold the 4million, which is the population of our enemy.

Moscow (a strategically important center) is protected by 2 to 4 batteries of S-400, cant Singapore afford 4 to 6 batteries to if calculations realli call for an extremely extremely tight protection envelope?<br><br>I believe in the future, somehow nuclear weapons for Singapore is the onli way to counter-balance overwhemming tactical/strategical threats posed by our neighbours. *i dun wanna to go into detail abt this because it will be extremely sensitive.

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>'In a speech in October 1999, Minister of State for Defence David Lim revealed that the SAF has developed secret capabilities, which he called 'sliver bullets', for use only in 'extreme conditions'. This apparently confirmed the long-rumoured existence of MINDEF's 'black programmes', based on clandestine local defence R&amp;D. Uncorroborated reports suggest that Singapore may have experimented with binary artillery shells and air-delivered bombs suitable for use with chemical agents, and in the mid-1990s allegedly showed interest in 120 km-range Russian SS-21 surface-to-surface missiles. However, bearing in mind Singapore's close relations with western powers and its signatory status in relation to international agreements such as the Non-Proliferation Treaty, Biological Warfare Convention and Convention on Chemical Weapons, it is highly unlikely that the republic has either developed or acquired weapons of mass destruction.'<br>--- Tim Huxley, <span style="font-style: italic;">Defending the Lion City </span>(254)</strong><br><br>Singapore definitely has the ability to manufacture chemical and biological weapons since the technologies for doing so are essentialy dual-use i.e. for both military and civilian purposes and we do currently possess vibrant chemicals and pharmaceutical industries. The only question is political will to do so. The usage of such weapons will invoke widespead outrage but note that WMDs are a weapon of last resort, intended for defensive/deterrent rather than offensive/compellent purposes.<br><br>Nukes are a separate question since their technologies are closely guarded and the scale of operations is such that it is impossible to hide their existence. Furthermore, acquiring nukes will prompt our neigbours to balance against us. This can already be seen in Malaysia's arms acquisitions which are aimed at us. Indeed, Pakistan acquired its nuclear capability following India's lead and there are now speculations that Japan'll acquire them too following N Korea. What's more, the blast from nuclear explosions may be limited but the radioactive fallout is over a wide area. Given the proximity of S'pore to our neighbours, winds'll carry the radioactive dust to our shores, affect our food supply from Malaysia etc.. Not feasible. The damage from nukes are long-term and given the interdependence between Malaysia, Indonesia and Singapore, we will be practically committing suicide.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by Langley:</div><div class="quote_body">Nukes are a separate question since their technologies are closely guarded and the scale of operations is such that it is impossible to hide their existence. Furthermore, acquiring nukes will prompt our neigbours to balance against us. This can already be seen in Malaysia's arms acquisitions which are aimed at us. What's more, the blast from nuclear explosions may be limited but the radioactive fallout is over a wide area. Given the proximity of S'pore to our neighbours, winds'll carry the radioactive dust to our shores, affect our food supply from Malaysia etc.. Not feasible.  </div></blockquote>If u are toking abt nuclear fallout and thus nuclear weapons aint feasible, i shall remind u that chemical weapons have closely similar effect and biological weapons, worst.<br><br>Why nuclear weapon is a good option is because it possess a close-to total destruction capability. As compared to chemical weapons, enemy with ample chemical warfare protection can still strike back a devastating blow with surviving units.<br><br>And i had said even if our opponents can match us with nuclear capabilities, Singaporeis still at advantage. If u are a malaysian leader, will u pre-empt Singapore with nuclear weapons to destroy our 4million population and risk an anhilation of ur 22million pple? If both sides are detered from total anhilation of each other, aint that a successful deterent?<br><br>The reason why WMD (and that includes nuclear) is a feasible choice for Singapore as a deterent is because at a point when we are overwhemmed by opponent's tactical/strategical weapons, we dun really have very much of a choice.  We can either seek other options (or do nothing) which contributes to weak deterence or seek WMDs which provide a strong ground for deterence but risk WMDs-aftermath if used.<br><br>Any interested forumners here might wanna read up on why Israel chosed to go nuclear despite the fact that her opponents are in close proximity to Israel.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Israel has more strategic depth than Singapore for it is a bigger country, protected from Syria by mountains i.e. the Golan Heights and Egypt by the Negev desert. Population centers are relatively protected in the heart of Israel. But I agree with your point. Israel's acquisition of nuclear capability despite its conventional superiority demonstrates the importance of nuclear deterrence. Still, however much we try to portary Singapore as the Israel of Southeast Asia, this analogy is not very helpful. Israel and her Arab neighbours as well as India and Pakistan fought 3 all-out wars since their independence. In every one of those wars, the very existence of Israel and Pakistan was at stake. This explains why they wanted to acquire nuclear weapons. But how many wars have Singapore fought with our neigbours? ( Confrontation is not a proper war for it involves only the limited use of force) Israelis dun go shopping in southern Lebanon but we do in JB. Singapore and Malaysia are each other's main trading partners (if not first then second I believe). Furthermore, we are not only integrated economically but also politically and socially. Destroying our neighbours with a nuclear strike is tantamount to destroying ourselves. You want a military capability capable of hurting but not destroying your potential regional adversaries.<br><br>A nuclear balance of power, any balance of power for that matter, is never stable. The US and the Soviets almost started WWIII over the Cuban Missile Crisis. Indian and Pakistan narrowly averted a nuclear exchange over Kargil. Mutually Assured Destruction is just that, MAD. Furthemore, note that MAD doctrine is not very effective in the case of close regional neighbours. The proximity between these countries is such that any missile will only take seconds to arrive, as compared to the several minutes the US and USSR had. Since the margin for error is very low, missile units in both countries will want to fire first for they do not want to be annihilated in a first strike. Any misunderstanding will be catastrophic. The temptation for a first strike can be reduced by a second strike capability. But I do not see Singapore acquring SSBNs in the future. No country will sell and to make one will be crazy. The other option is to keep F-16s armed with nuclear gravity bombs in the air at all times (Think Clancy's Sum of All Fears). But then, there is a reason why the US developed the B-2 bomber. Strong air defences can readily take bombers out of the sky, especially since high-value targets e.g. KL will be well-protected. At the end of the day, acquiring a nuclear deterrent does not mean conflict will magically disappear. Miscalculations and misunderstandings can still prompt nuclear states towards a nuclear exchange.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Yes we have everything to lose. I dunno about you but we can't survive beyond the first exchange, and if we do get nukes, you can be sure other nations will do so as well.<br><br>So who uses it first? If we use it on them, they will have no qualms about doing so and we all die. And will they use it on us? I don't think so because they know that we will not resort to a nuclear exhange unless we have nothing more to lose so we our nuclear weapons are nullified as long as they engage in conventional warfare with us.<br><br>In the end, our nukes won't stop agressors from trying to invade us, if they also have nukes. They know that as long as they are willing to keep things to a conventional level, they can wage all the war they can want and we wun push the button.<br><br>I've heard of dumber ideas like getting nukes and abolishing NS, that's a worse idea. A aggressor can just stroll into our nation, who has no credible armed forces to resist them because they know that the moment we press the button, we're dead and everything we've worked for is gone. So we have no choice but to hand our nation, nukes and all to them.<br><br>Nuclear weapons are generally quite useless to us. Their power is appealing but they are way too powerful for any good, especially in an ASEAN context. Israel? They hardly have a choice, they need all the firepower they can get against an enemy that will stop at nothing to kill them.<br><br></div>

Population centers are relatively protected in the heart of Israel.</blockquote>I agree with u on the fact that Israel have more strategic depth, however u must understand that the dreadful aftermath on Israel of any nuclear retaliation is still real just that the effect might not be as drastic as what Singapore might encounter.<br><br>Eventhough of close proximity, that doesnt deter India and Pakistan to go nuclear. It is the mutual understanding of MAD that actually prevent them from going to war with each other. Imagine India is the supreme player here, they would have invaded Pakistan long ago. To counter that balance, Pakistan go nuclear. To counter the strategic threat, Singapore might go nuclear in the future.<br><br>When we plan for nuclear, we dun directly plan to use it, but plan how can we intimidate our enemy with it and hopefully we wont have to use that extremely measure.<br><br><blockquote>Israelis dun go shopping in southern Lebanon but we do in JB.

We are to an assumption that our neighbours are not in good term with Singapore and how are we going to retalitate with a strategic attack when we are strategically attack.<br><br>In a war between Singapore and our neighbours, we cant just merely hurt our neighbours. We must destroy them brutally and totally inorder to assure no subsequence retaliation. Singapore cant afford to gain standpoint victory but it is total victory that we must achieve.<br><br>Quoted from BG Lee:<br><br>''The SAF is an armed force , not a civilian corporation. Its mission is to <strong>defeat its enemies, ruthlessly and completely</strong>. Its an instrument of controlled fury, designed to visit death and destruction of its foes...soldiers must have steel in their souls .....must learn in war to kill and not to flinch, to destroy and not to feel pity, to be a flaming sword in the righteous cause of national survival.''<br><br>Do u really think BG Lee said those statement for shiok, or as a consideration to our vulnerability?<br><br>Singapore and Malaysia are currently in reliance of each other, but this does not stop us from over-arming ourselve inorder for us to be at supreme side in case of a conflict. Why do we borther to over arm overselve now? It is because we want to destroy our enemy totally inorder to achieve total victory in war, giving them no chance of fighting back.<br><br>So u arguement about our reliance on malaysia and thus we can onli afford to hurt them .... is invalid.<br><br><blockquote>At the end of the day, acquiring a nuclear deterrent does not mean conflict will magically disappear.

Eventhough our deterence is strong, the possibility of conflict never disappear. Did any general or minister said that because of deterence is strong, conflict magically disappear?<br><br>In any case which Singapore have to choice but to opt for WMD, it is to strengthen our deterent level but not to totally erase off the possibility of war.<br><br>Thus ur statement is again invalid.<br><br></div>
