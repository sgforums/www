            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote>Eventhough of close proximity, that doesnt deter India and Pakistan to go nuclear. It is the mutual understanding of MAD that actually prevent them from going to war with each other. Imagine India is the supreme player here, they would have invaded Pakistan long ago. To counter that balance, Pakistan go nuclear. To counter the strategic threat, Singapore might go nuclear in the future. </blockquote>Yes, you are right. Nuclear weapons serve as a very effective strategic deterrent, especially for small and vulnerable countries like Israel, Pakistan and Singapore. What I want to point out is this: it is quite easy to acquire nuclear weapons but very hard to have a stable balance of nuclear terror. You'll need second-strike and advanced detection capabilities. In other words, you must not be deaf and blind to nuclear missile launch and you must be able to retailate after most of your nuclear forces have been wiped out in a first strike.<br><br>Detection-wise, the US and USSR depend on satellites to provide early warning of missile launch. This advanced detection capability is something that non-superpowers would not have. From what I know, India and Pakistan almost came to nuclear war in 1999 till the US intervened and provided early warning capability to both sides to curb the temptation for a first strike.<br><br><blockquote>No need of SSBN, nuclear cruisemissile armed Sjoormens will do. The US developed the B-2 to enable them to strike conventionally or unconventionally anywhere on this globe. If we will to tok abt nuclear mission, the B-2 was designed to penetrate deep into Russia and release the load. In Singapore case, we dun realli have to penetrate deep into our neigbours to reach their main pulse. Currently our F-16Ds are designated as RSAF's deep strike fighter/bombers. In USAF, the F-16 is jus a light fighter/bomber.<br>What i mean is that u cant always fit US's requirement to that of Singapore's shoe. Thus i see no purpose for u to bring up the B-2. </blockquote>Perhaps AEW aircraft can provide early warning, given again that we are quite close to each other. However, there is still one problem. Second-strike wise, can the Sjoormen be modified to carry cruise missiles? You'll have to shoot it out through the torpedo tubes right? Anyway, I see your point. Perhaps we could modify our frigates and subs to carry nuclear-capable cruise missiles. And since Malaysia is long rather than wide, our F-16s can first fly along the Straits of Malacca then turn inward to attack KL. No need for deep penetration. Still, once you enter Malaysian airspace, it would be hot. A closely coordinated air defence with fighters and SAMs would be hard to penetrate in any case. And nuclear bombs are high-value assests. How many do you think we can afford to lose? China only has around two dozen warheads, and Israel, India and Pakistan probably around the same. Hence, I brought up the B2.<br><br>In sum, the possession of nuclear weapons by 2 close enemies is a recipe for disaster unless, like the US and USSR, they can manage this through advanced technology. Such an effort is very difficult and costly. Hence, it is impractical in SEA's case.<br><br><blockquote>I didnt say that conflict will magically disappear.<br><br>Look at Singapore now. Eventhough our deterence is strong, the possibility of conflict never disappear. Did any general or minister said that because of deterence is strong, conflict magically disappear?<br><br>In any case which Singapore have to choice but to opt for WMD, it is to strengthen our deterent level but not to totally erase off the possibility of war.<br><br>Thus ur statement is again invalid. </blockquote>Yes, you are right. There is deterrent value in nukes. I'm juz saying that this is a very unstable system which is not easy to manage and that could turn out to be counter-productive as well. If both sides release their nukes in a moment of panic and destroy 20 million lives, then what's the point?<br><br><blockquote>I think u are missing the arguement over here. We are to an assumption that our neighbours are not in good term with Singapore and how are we going to retalitate with a strategic attack when we are strategically attack.<br><br>In a war between Singapore and our neighbours, we cant just merely hurt our neighbours. We must destroy them brutally and totally inorder to assure no subsequence retaliation. Singapore cant afford to gain standpoint victory but it is total victory that we must achieve.<br><br>Quoted from BG Lee:<br><br>''The SAF is an armed force , not a civilian corporation. Its mission is to defeat its enemies, ruthlessly and completely. Its an instrument of controlled fury, designed to visit death and destruction of its foes...soldiers must have steel in their souls .....must learn in war to kill and not to flinch, to destroy and not to feel pity, to be a flaming sword in the righteous cause of national survival.''<br><br>Do u really think BG Lee said those statement for shiok, or as a consideration to our vulnerability?<br><br>Singapore and Malaysia are currently in reliance of each other, but this does not stop us from over-arming ourselve inorder for us to be at supreme side in case of a conflict. Why do we borther to over arm overselve now? It is because we want to destroy our enemy totally inorder to achieve total victory in war, giving them no chance of fighting back.<br><br>So u arguement about our reliance on malaysia and thus we can onli afford to hurt them .... is invalid. </blockquote>In wartime, I think there is a need to draw a distinction between destroying the enemy's military and the enemy's entire country. I'm not saying you should not destroy the enemy's military. This we must do. However, there is a need to avoid destroying his entire country using nukes. If Malaysia disintegrates, we kena also since we are so closely linked. Hence, my point is that we should aim to hurt the MAF jialat jialat but not turn the whole of Malaysia into another Hiroshima or Dresden. My argument for interdependence is simply that in the event of war, cooler heads are likely to prevail on both sides of the Causeway since we would have everything to lose and not much to gain by fighting. Indeed, why do you think we still have not fought a single war by now despite all the tensions we are having with Malaysia? Of course, this is due to military deterrence but also the realization that war would destroy our economies.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>A deterrent is useless if it cannot be used. And once it is used, we will be doomed, yes unless we develop TMD. That's why its called MAD. Also, MAD doctrine only applies when both sides have developed a feasible second-strike capability i.e. SSBNs and strategic bombers. Only when you know your enemies are capable of retailation after a first strike will you be deterred from striking first for such an act would indeed be suicide. Hence the term <span style="font-style: italic;">Mutually Assured </span>Destruction. Otherwise, the order of the day would be preemption---destroying your enemies' nuclear forces in a first strike so that retailation would either be impossible or limited. And since no country would want to be the target of a first strike, they would try to preempt the other as well. This is the stage India and Pakistan are in right now. A very precarious balance.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Simple, have an armed forces that can make a new Singapore out of them if they every try to destroy this one. Heh.<br><br>Of course, there are political factors, other then sheer firepower that will decide a future conflict. Redland and whatever colour can't just loose ASTROs after ASTROs anyhow to wipe out Singapore without raising some kind of global response, especially when many nations have a vested interest in Singapore.<br><br>And of course, it takes a heck load of ASTROs to reduce Singapore to wasteland. While they can saturate the whole of Singapore with explosives, they simply can't main enough explosives per area to level Singapore. And of course, that is under the assumption that the SAF is going to sit by and idly watch while they fire away, or not do anything to counter them.</div>

Even with a very stable balance-of-power, there is still one thing we must look out for, and that is the potential opponent's leadership and how rational he is. A suicidal political (possibly North Korea's Kim) or military leadership, or the inability of the government to totally control it's military forces could mean disasterous no matter how stable the nuclear balance is.

Economy wise, we are more competitive than complementary (Malaysia's Proton vs. Nissan in Thailand etc.) and intra-ASEAN trade is low coz every ASEAN state trades more with G7 countries than among themselves. That's why the ASEAN Free Trade Agreement is grounding to a halt. Security wise, because all ASEAN countries view each other as potential advesaries as well as partners (esp. among Singapore, Malaysia and Indonesia) there has been no defence pact like NATO and no plans for it in the coming future. 911 resulted in limited security cooperation only after the Bali bombing and only in counter-terrorism. ASEAN's purpose is not regional integration like EU but more of managing regional conflicts so that they dun get out of hand. The limits of ASEAN can be seen in the 1997 Asian Financial Crisis where not only ASEAN economies but also their relations with each other got into a really bad state. So a strong SAF is going to be necessary for a very long time to come.</div>
