            <div class='col-md body'>In terms of looks - the SAR21 is similar to the AUG.<br>In terms of concept - the SAR21 is similar to the TAV21.<br>Mechanically - I suspect the SAR21 could be similar to UK's SA80 and China's Norinco QBZ-97 bullpup assualt rifle. Both have similar user operations.<br>Then again, the South Africans have their Vector CR21 bullpup released at about the same time as the SAR21, TAV21 and QBZ-97.<br><br>I remembered one poster - who had the chance to use the FAMAS and AUG here in Singapore during trials before the SAR21. Perhaps he can share his opinions.<br><br>edit - the photos of the South African CR21, China's QBZ-97, AUG, TAV21 and SAR21 are found at - http://www.securityarms.com/index.htm</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>A forward pistol grip is not necessarily tactically superior to a normal rifle foregrip. The normal rifle foregrip is easier to go prone with, while the forward pistol grip is better when you are firing from a standing or kneeling position, particularly in CQB. Which one is better depends on what situation you are using the rifle in. It makes sense that the standard issue SAR-21 has a standard grip, since SAF infantry tactics involve firing mostly from the prone position. This photo is of an Army marksman who shoots in competitions for the SAF, where they might have to fire from the standing position.<br><br>The mechanism of the SAR-21 is based on the Ultimax, which was designed with help from Eugene Stoner, designer of the M16. It was certainly designed in cooperation with the Israelis, who produced the TAR-21 at almost the same time. So the rifle has design input from American and Israeli sources, but it is definitely still a Singaporean design. There is no design that is not in some way based on others.<br><br>The SAR-21 still has some teething problems, which I hope ST resolves soon. ST never gets anything perfectly right on the first try, but usually the third try is the charm. Look at the Ultimax Mk 1 vs Mk 2 vs Mk 3 for example.</div>

Just that it was common. When you get stuck with a pile of junk and have nothing better to work with, then sooner or later you'll think that it's the best rifle in the world. The truth is, we use them because of their precision compared to the AK-47 and other rifles, was relatively common, and that's about it. The rest of the M16 features are thumbs down. Especially it's reliability, which is prehaps one of the most important aspects of any firearm.<br><br>The SAR-21 is certainly a superior weapon to the M-16, no doubts about it.

The current version used by the US. Just that it was common. When you get stuck with a pile of junk and have nothing better to work with, then sooner or later you'll think that it's the best rifle in the world. The truth is, we use them because of their precision compared to the AK-47 and other rifles, was relatively common, and that's about it. The rest of the M16 features are thumbs down. Especially it's reliability, which is prehaps one of the most important aspects of any firearm.<br><br>The SAR-21 is certainly a superior weapon to the M-16, no doubts about it. And far superior at that.</div></blockquote>in the end, the superiority or inferiority of the wpn depends on the end users, and not mere and empirical comparisons of the specs and performance in labs. so i guess time will tell.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>
