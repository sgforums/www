With a weight of 3.8kg , i dun think it is light. The Famas is 0.2kg lighter than the AUG , i dun see it with a foregrip. The M-16A2 is 3.77kg which is lighter than the AUG , i dun see it with a foregrip too.<br><br>The reason why some guns require a foregrip is to stabilise the recoil of some guns to improve accuracy. A foregrip will not be a standard issue for some guns which do not need a foregrip for better accuracy. Foregrip will not improve the accuracy of some guns greatly and thus wont be introduce.<br><br>The AUG's foregrip can be push forward so that the firer can shoot the weapon without the foregrip. In some shooting stances , it is better without the foregrip ( such as firing in narrow trenches )....<br><br>The SAR-21 is well reputed for her accuracy even without the foregrip , thus i will see that we dun need a standard foregrip on the SAR-21.</div>

            </div>
            <div class='col-md body'>Ahem...<br><br>I never had any illusions about the SAR-21 being a ORGINAL weapon, as par say. For no firearm in the world can be considered original. They all draw their design heritage from some earlier design. Even the US army OICWS is not an entirely new weapons system in it's like. There's no denying the SAR-21 draws it's design inspirations from several sucessful firearm designs... who wouldn't? Is Proton Saga even remotely malaysian save the logo?<br><br>But what is the line between a copy and an indigenous firearm. A copy simply rips off the original design and creates a crude product that is a parody or little different from the original. The SAR-21 is certainly no AUG wannabe or rip-off. It has been carefully designed drawing inspiration and lessons from previous firearms, not just the AUG, to create a firearm that is indigeous to Singaporean requirements, and not only that, it is one of the finest firearms in the world as well.<br><br>So is the SAR-21 a AUG rip off, any weapons expert can tell you that you have to be half out of your mind/ or malaysian trying desperately to put it down, to buy that little piece of spin telling, not surprising, considering that a certainly northern country trives on telling themselves wild stories to boost their own ego.<br><br>if you put both rifles side by side, you'll realize that despite external apperances, the SAR-21 is a more advanced rifle then the AUG.<br><br>There are several reasons for this: Firstly, the SAR-21 is a whole generation of firearms ahead of the AUG, and hence uses new technologies and designed based on lessons learned from older weapons. The SAR is more reliable, durable, accucrate and far easier to strip and maintain then the AUG. In terms of patented technology, the SAR-21 is a generation ahead, simply because it's a newer weapon, there's no propangada involved here, it's just that way.<br><br>As for the TAR-21, ahem... do you think the similarities are a result of coincidence? It's an open secret that ST cooperates with the IDF on weapons R&amp;D, and it's hardly a surprise that these two firearms have a interwoven development history.<br><br>Before you raise issues of copying, it would be good to know that the SAR-21 came out BEFORE the TAR-21 was revealed.<br><br>All in all, it is almost too easy to argue, no, point out, that the SAR-21 easiy suceeds the AUG as an infantry weapon. And in war, big talk about who copies who becomes irrevelant because what you need is not rethoric, but a better weapon. Unfortunately, it appears the MAF is stocking up on rethoric rather then hardware and brains.<br><br>Maybe when you guys come up with the MAT-21 then we'll talk. Other then that, to buy cheap stories of the SAR-21 being a AUG copy is indicative of your true level of grounding in reality.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Who ever said SAR-21 is 100 percent Sg? But it's undeniable that while not 100 percent Singaporean, it is clearly an <strong>indigenous</strong> weapon, and a really good one at that.<br><br>SAR-21 stripping is far easier then the AUG, that's for sure, ahving seen how both weapons break down. In terms of design, the SAR-21 is a generation ahead. It breaks down into three parts without any tools and it can be down within 12 seconds relaxing and not rushing.<br><br>Stripping aside, that weapon is a real mule as well, built to wistand the harshest of abuse and still work well. Teething problems aside, the SAR-21 is right up there as one of the finest firearms in the world.<br><br>Let's not start on another Indigenous weapon, the Ultimax.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I'm afriad the paper "Tiger" in here has crossed that line a long time ago, chosing to relate his arguments about the SAR-21 to petty little politically/nationally motivated arguments which hold little water. I simply pointed out the all to obvious flaws in the typically malaysian style of his arguments on how the SAR-21 is "obviously" a copy.<br><br>One needs to look at the "obvious" logic of his arguments. Just observe the "SAR-21 is a adapted TAR-21" gag, true blue malaysian politicx...<br><br>Maybe the paper tiger needs to know a few more facts about the SAR-21 before he formulates his next "arguments", which would be good. Because it would be nice to hear an actual fact come from him once in a while.</div>
