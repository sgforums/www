I'm not sure how well the puma is doing in australia but seems that the local ones have got rid of their problems. i personally detest french aircraft, all my life the  french made planes(civil and military) that i got involved with are lousy compare to american ones.

The new modification was glimpsed for the first time at the Avalon Air Show, Melbourne during February.<br><br>Since 1999, an RSAF helicopter unit (126 Sqn) has been based at Oakey in Queensland, to take advantage of Australia's wide and open training spaces. There are currently 12 aircraft detached with 126 Sqn (a mix of Cougars and Super Pumas) and, according to RSAF sources, six of them have received the FLIR fit.<br><br></div>
