            <div class='col-md body'>i am wondering if anyone could tell me how many helos are the navy looking to purchase...<br><br>So.. far, the impression i got is for 6 helos for the new delta frigate project...<br><br>BUT i am wondering if the navy might actually be looking at more helos... for 2 reasons..<br><br>1.... the 6 helos need to have some on standby and some on maintainace... thus... shouldnt the navy take into consideration of a few maybe 2 to 3 helos being sent for either trainning or maintainance at any one time....<br><br>2.... the navy currently operates 4 LPDs... and from wat i gathered... the LPD can operate 2 to 4 helos as well... shouldnt the navy then have a few on those LPDs as well??<br><br>3.... the navy's newest base at changi is next to an airforce base... thus it shouldnt be too hard to envisage the navy air wing sharing some facilities with the RSAF at CAFB right??<br><br>4.... assuming that the navy's newest helo can conduct ASW or other missions including anti-ship and amphibious landing... cant they operate afew of these helos out of CAB instead of a ship??<br><br>5.... CAFB is so near 9th division... the combine helo units of RSN and RSAF could make 9th div a super rapid helo deployable division... would it not??</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>The contenders for the naval helo programme are the SH-60, NH-90 and a navalised version of the super puma/cougar.<br>I personally prefer the NH-90, the best and most advanced of the three. Moreover, there is a army tatical helicopter version of the NH-90 which can replace the Hueys. The SH-60/UH-60's design is a bit too old. However, Eurocopter has also offered to fit NH-90 advanced equipment onto the Super Puma/Cougar. If this is chosen, it  can provide some commonality with our RSAF super puma fleet.</div>

If you look at the picture released by Mindef, you could make out the design of the helo on the aft deck as a Sikorsky S-92, although selecting this design is too risky, and we would unlikely want to be the launch customer (Ireland was supposed to be the launch customer, but I think has changed its mind due to budgetry reasons). So the size of the NH90 or Super Puma would not be a hindrance. As for CH47D and V-22, too big, unable to fit into the habgar of our LPDs (aka Endurance "LST"). Moreover, V-22 's future is still hanging in the balance in lieu of the outcome of the latest trials. </div></blockquote>mi think is either seahawk or nh-90</div>
