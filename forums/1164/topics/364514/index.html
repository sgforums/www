              <p><a href="http://www.subsim.com/radioroom//showthread.php?t=90065">http://www.subsim.com/radioroom//showthread.php?t=90065</a></p>
              <p>the italian/french Development of Black Shark began in 1997 to meet the Italian Navy's requirement for a new-generation heavyweight torpedo for its new U212A-class submarines. Originally known as the A184 Advanced - indicating its provenance in the earlier A184 Mod 3 heavyweight torpedo - the weapon was renamed to reflect WASS' assertion that its capabilities were significantly superior to the legacy A184 line. DCN St Tropez, as partner to WASS, is taking responsibility for the development of the Black Shark's battery system and electric motor. <br>Black Shark incorporates a new Advanced Sonar Transmitting and Receiving Architecture (ASTRA) active/passive acoustic homing head; an updated guidance-and-control section; a fibre-optic guidance link and spool; a new electric motor; and a skewed contra-rotating propeller. ASTRA, originally developed under a separate national programme, is a multibeam steerable planar array with digital pulse compression in any transmission mode, multifrequency operations in both active (frequency modulation and continuous wave) and passive modes, and independent processing of each frequency (active and passive) on each lobe. <br>ASTRA operates at 15 kHz (passive medium frequency only) and 30 kHz (active and passive high frequency). The seeker can operate simultaneously in both frequencies in passive mode, allowing the torpedo to discriminate between signals from a real target and signals from an acoustic countermeasure decoy. A fibre-optic link has been introduced in place of a conventional wire-guidance link. This carries sensor data and command and guidance signals to and from the submarine, allowing the torpedo to operate as a forward-deployed sensor for the submarine. Use of optical fibre allows a higher data exchange rate between the submarine and its weapon, offering a nominal 100 per cent increase in guidance range. <br>Propulsion is provided by a brushless axial flux motor powered by a new AlAgO battery fitted with an electrolyte management system (a low-cost rechargeable lithium ion battery is being developed for exercise use). <br>The propulsor itself uses contra-rotating 13-blade and 10-blade carbon fibre propellers. Top speed exceeds 52 kt. <br>Black Shark has entered low-rate production prior to final completion of acceptance testing. A first operational launch was undertaken in November 2004 from O'Higgins, the first of two Scorpene submarines being acquired by the Chilean Navy. The trial, forming part of the submarine's acceptance programme, was carried out by DCN International in international waters along the French-Spanish coastline. <br>Chile also plans to outload Black Shark to its two Type 209/1300 submarines, Thompson and Simpson. Both boats are to receive a command and weapon-control system update from UDS International, which will offer commonality with the Scorpenes and enable them to operate Black Shark alongside the existing SUT weapon. <br>Italy will outload Black Shark on to its new U212A submarines, Salvatore Todaro and ScirÃ©. It will also equip the existing submarines of the Sauro class, which are currently armed with the A184 Mod 3 heavyweight torpedo. <br>As well as being sold to Chile, Black Shark has also secured a berth aboard the two new Scorpene submarines being purchased by Malaysia from Armaris, and on the two Type 209/1500PN boats ordered by Portugal from Howaldtswerke-Deutsche Werft (part of ThyssenKrupp Marine Systems).</p>

              <p><strong><span style="color: #ff0000;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">AdelaideNow: Collins Class a Triumph</span></span></span></strong></p>
              <p>DEREK WOOLNER</p>
              <p>May 12, 2008 12:15am</p>
              <p><strong>PEOPLE in the street and some sections of the media dismiss the navy's Adelaide-built Collins Class submarines as monumental duds.</strong></p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">In stark contrast, most insiders we interviewed, as the authors of the history of the project, consider them a naval engineering triumph and a monument of Australian nation-building.</span></p>
              <p>From its inception in 1978 the project was seldom far from controversy and it was mercilessly attacked by the media and the Howard government for a myriad of technical failings – real, exaggerated and imagined.</p>
              <p>It is widely believed to have been a financial disaster, <span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>yet it is one of the few military purchases where the original budget was still relevant at the end of the project.</strong></span></p>
              <p><strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">Further, Australian industry responded successfully to the challenge of building submarines in this country, an achievement widely believed to be beyond Australian capabilities and one in which many other countries have failed disastrously.</span></strong></p>
              <p>During the 1970s the Australian Navy operated British-built Oberon diesel-electric submarines on some of the most secret intelligence-gathering missions of the ColdWar.</p>
              <p>Nuclear submarines lacked the stealth for these covert operations, and the U.S. Navy encouraged Australian military planners and politicians to maintain the long-range intelligence-gathering capability in the Oberons' successor vessels.</p>
              <p>At the same time the Australian submariners developed convincing arguments that submarines were the most effective vessels for use in long-range offensive operations in enemy waters.</p>
              <p>Thus was born the desire to build the most modern long-range conventional submarine in the world.</p>
              <p>Modernity would be attained through a then-revolutionary idea: Instead of taking whatever options for a combat system came with the design, the navy would specify the combat system which best met its needs and this would be developed separately from the submarine.</p>
              <p>Further, following intense debate, it was decided to build the submarines in Adelaide as a focus for industrial regeneration and to provide better long-term maintenance and support than was usually received from overseas shipyards.</p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>These factors determined the nature of the Collins project. To U.S. submariner Admiral Phil Davis, the project was a huge undertaking, a "monumental feat".</strong></span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>"There is really nothing in the history of submarine construction that has been done like that," he said of the transformation of a small Swedish submarine into a "radical new design", built 18,000km from the designer's office "in a new yard with a new workforce".</strong></span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>Amazingly, the project's objectives were largely delivered. Today, the Australian Navy operates sophisticated long-range submarines.</strong></span></p>
              <p>Peter Sinclair, the first skipper of HMAS Collins, who has wide experience with other conventional submarines, believes the Collins is more capable than any conventional submarine at sea, with a turning circle second to none and "super quiet at slow speed, quieter than anything else in the world".</p>
              <p><strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">Few thought that Australia's recession-ravaged industries of the early 1980s could build a submarine. Yet, with the introduction of modern techniques that accompanied the project, over 70 per cent of its value was produced in Australia by hundreds of subcontractors who embraced the exacting defence quality standards. The welding standards remain some of the best achieved in the world.</span></strong></p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>THE project suffered its share of problems but the only surprise, given the ambition of the project, was that they were not better anticipated.</strong></span></p>
              <p>With problems overcome through some remarkable defence science and assistance from the U.S., the submarines were delivered close to budget and an average of 26 months behind schedule.</p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>This is one of the shortest delays with any military purchase and remarkable for the largest systems integration project in Australian history.</strong></span></p>
              <p>The persisting failure has been the combat system, a testament to both the inadequacies of some of the world's major arms corporations and the unchecked ambition of Australian submariners.</p>
              <p>Even this disaster was <strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">salvaged by the expertise and ingenuity of Australia's project engineers and defence scientists, cobbling together a system to provide an acceptable performance.</span></strong></p>
              <p><strong>Derek Woolner is an expert on defence procurement projects, and is Visiting Fellow at the Strategic and Defence Studies Centre at the Australian National University. He is co-author, with Peter Yule, of The Collins Class Submarine Story – Steel, Spies and Spin.</strong></p>
              <p>The Australian navy has six Collins Class submarines, designed by the Swedish company Kockums, and built by the Australian Submarine Corporation at Adelaide between 1989 and 2003. The construction of the Collins class submarines was Australia's largest and most controversial military purchase. The submarine project was subjected to an unprecedented level of media scrutiny and criticism, became highly politicised and on several occasions faced the prospect of being abandoned.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The general public perception of the submarine project is that it was a hugely expensive failure and that the submarines are noisy 'dud subs'. While I am far from being an apologist for the navy, it is amazing how wrong this perception is. The submarines were indeed expensive - all modern weapons are expensive - but the submarine project was one of Australia's few modern military purchases in which the initial budget was still relevant at the end of the project. The submarines were a financial success.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The Collins submarines had technical problems - all new and complex machinery has teething problems - <strong>but the general belief that they are 'noisy as a rock concert' is wrong. The reality is that they are probably the second-quietest submarines in the world, with the only quieter ones being the Swedish Gotland class, Kockums' next design after the Collins class. <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">The minor noise problems of the early submarines, as with the other mechanical issues, have long since been solved.</span></span></strong></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>However, the submarines suffered from one major defect which the media and the public never really picked up on. The combat system - that is the computer systems in the submarine used to find enemies and fire torpedoes or missiles at them - has been by far the largest problem for the Collins class submarines. The earlier Oberon class submarines had a largely Australian-built combat system which was one of the best in the world. When our submariners began planning the combat system for the new submarines, they naturally wanted an even better one. However, what they asked for proved to be too hard to build and the combat system never worked properly - in fact it was never finished - and it was abandoned in 2000.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The navy then ran a competition to select the best available combat system already in operation in foreign submarines - a competition won easily by a European electronics company. However, the result was overturned by the coalition government, which insisted that our submarines had to have an American combat system. As the Americans did not have a combat system suitable for non-nuclear submarines, the consequence was that it was not until 2007 that our submarines began to be fitted with a combat system of the standard hoped for when the submarines were designed back in the 1980s.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">The media and the public (and even to a surprising extent, the navy) never understood the sheer scale, complexity and risk of the submarine project. Building submarines is hard and getting harder - far harder than building aeroplanes, the closest analogy is perhaps with space ships. To build a hull to withstand extreme water pressures has always been demanding but the increasing complexities of electronics and computer systems make modern submarines among the greatest of engineering challenges. Even countries with long histories of submarine construction often have problems, while countries attempting to build submarines for the first time regularly experience disasters. Dilapidated or abandoned shipyards from Buenos Aires to Bombay, littered with the relics of failed submarine projects testify to the magnitude of the challenges.</span></strong></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The submarine project was taken up with great enthusiasm by the Hawke government in the 1980s as a major nation building endevour to revitalise Australian manufacturing. Consequently the submarines were built in Australia rather than overseas and over 70% of the money spent on the submarines was spent in Australia - a far higher proportion than with most military purchases. The end result of the project is a squadron of submarines that are among the best conventional submarines in any navy in the world and rank with the F111s as Australia's most potent weapons. <strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">The Collins Class submarines were an extraordinary engineering achievement and it is testimony to the power of politics and the popular press (lionnoisy) that they are regarded as a disaster</span></strong>.</p>
              <p>Australia leads the way in Submarine development, not STK!</p>

              <p>the italian/french Development of Black Shark began in 1997 to
              meet the Italian Navy's requirement for a new-generation
              heavyweight torpedo for its new U212A-class submarines. Originally
              known as the A184 Advanced - indicating its provenance in the
              earlier A184 Mod 3 heavyweight torpedo - the weapon was renamed to
              reflect WASS' assertion that its capabilities were significantly
              superior to the legacy A184 line. DCN St Tropez, as partner to
              WASS, is taking responsibility for the development of the Black
              Shark's battery system and electric motor.<br> Black Shark incorporates a new Advanced Sonar Transmitting and
              Receiving Architecture (ASTRA) active/passive acoustic homing head;
              an updated guidance-and-control section; a fibre-optic guidance
              link and spool; a new electric motor; and a skewed contra-rotating
              propeller. ASTRA, originally developed under a separate national
              programme, is a multibeam steerable planar array with digital pulse
              compression in any transmission mode, multifrequency operations in
              both active (frequency modulation and continuous wave) and passive
              modes, and independent processing of each frequency (active and
              passive) on each lobe.<br> ASTRA operates at 15 kHz (passive medium frequency only) and 30 kHz
              (active and passive high frequency). The seeker can operate
              simultaneously in both frequencies in passive mode, allowing the
              torpedo to discriminate between signals from a real target and
              signals from an acoustic countermeasure decoy. A fibre-optic link
              has been introduced in place of a conventional wire-guidance link.
              This carries sensor data and command and guidance signals to and
              from the submarine, allowing the torpedo to operate as a
              forward-deployed sensor for the submarine. Use of optical fibre
              allows a higher data exchange rate between the submarine and its
              weapon, offering a nominal 100 per cent increase in guidance
              range.<br> Propulsion is provided by a brushless axial flux motor powered by a
              new AlAgO battery fitted with an electrolyte management system (a
              low-cost rechargeable lithium ion battery is being developed for
              exercise use).<br> The propulsor itself uses contra-rotating 13-blade and 10-blade
              carbon fibre propellers. Top speed exceeds 52 kt.<br> Black Shark has entered low-rate production prior to final
              completion of acceptance testing. A first operational launch was
              undertaken in November 2004 from O'Higgins, the first of two
              Scorpene submarines being acquired by the Chilean Navy. The trial,
              forming part of the submarine's acceptance programme, was carried
              out by DCN International in international waters along the
              French-Spanish coastline.<br> Chile also plans to outload Black Shark to its two Type 209/1300
              submarines, Thompson and Simpson. Both boats are to receive a
              command and weapon-control system update from UDS International,
              which will offer commonality with the Scorpenes and enable them to
              operate Black Shark alongside the existing SUT weapon.<br> Italy will outload Black Shark on to its new U212A submarines,
              Salvatore Todaro and ScirÃ©. It will also equip the existing
              submarines of the Sauro class, which are currently armed with the
              A184 Mod 3 heavyweight torpedo.<br> As well as being sold to Chile, Black Shark has also secured a
              berth aboard the two new Scorpene submarines being purchased by
              Malaysia from Armaris, and on the two Type 209/1500PN boats ordered
              by Portugal from Howaldtswerke-Deutsche Werft (part of ThyssenKrupp
              Marine Systems).</p>

              Triumph</span></span></span></strong></p>
              <p>DEREK WOOLNER</p>
              <p>May 12, 2008 12:15am</p>
              <p><strong>PEOPLE in the street and some sections of the media
              dismiss the navy's Adelaide-built Collins Class submarines as
              monumental duds.</strong></p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">In stark contrast, most insiders
              we interviewed, as the authors of the history of the project,
              consider them a naval engineering triumph and a monument of
              Australian nation-building.</span></p>
              <p>From its inception in 1978 the project was seldom far from
              controversy and it was mercilessly attacked by the media and the
              Howard government for a myriad of technical failings – real,
              exaggerated and imagined.</p>
              <p>It is widely believed to have been a financial disaster,
              <span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>yet it is one of the few
              military purchases where the original budget was still relevant at
              the end of the project.</strong></span></p>
              <p><strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">Further, Australian
              industry responded successfully to the challenge of building
              submarines in this country, an achievement widely believed to be
              beyond Australian capabilities and one in which many other
              countries have failed disastrously.</span></strong></p>
              <p>During the 1970s the Australian Navy operated British-built
              Oberon diesel-electric submarines on some of the most secret
              intelligence-gathering missions of the ColdWar.</p>
              <p>Nuclear submarines lacked the stealth for these covert
              operations, and the U.S. Navy encouraged Australian military
              planners and politicians to maintain the long-range
              intelligence-gathering capability in the Oberons' successor
              vessels.</p>
              <p>At the same time the Australian submariners developed convincing
              arguments that submarines were the most effective vessels for use
              in long-range offensive operations in enemy waters.</p>
              <p>Thus was born the desire to build the most modern long-range
              conventional submarine in the world.</p>
              <p>Modernity would be attained through a then-revolutionary idea:
              Instead of taking whatever options for a combat system came with
              the design, the navy would specify the combat system which best met
              its needs and this would be developed separately from the
              submarine.</p>
              <p>Further, following intense debate, it was decided to build the
              submarines in Adelaide as a focus for industrial regeneration and
              to provide better long-term maintenance and support than was
              usually received from overseas shipyards.</p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>These factors determined
              the nature of the Collins project. To U.S. submariner Admiral Phil
              Davis, the project was a huge undertaking, a "monumental
              feat".</strong></span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>"There is really nothing
              in the history of submarine construction that has been done like
              that," he said of the transformation of a small Swedish submarine
              into a "radical new design", built 18,000km from the designer's
              office "in a new yard with a new workforce".</strong></span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>Amazingly, the project's
              objectives were largely delivered. Today, the Australian Navy
              operates sophisticated long-range submarines.</strong></span></p>
              <p>Peter Sinclair, the first skipper of HMAS Collins, who has wide
              experience with other conventional submarines, believes the Collins
              is more capable than any conventional submarine at sea, with a
              turning circle second to none and "super quiet at slow speed,
              quieter than anything else in the world".</p>
              <p><strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">Few thought that
              Australia's recession-ravaged industries of the early 1980s could
              build a submarine. Yet, with the introduction of modern techniques
              that accompanied the project, over 70 per cent of its value was
              produced in Australia by hundreds of subcontractors who embraced
              the exacting defence quality standards. The welding standards
              remain some of the best achieved in the world.</span></strong></p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>THE project suffered its
              share of problems but the only surprise, given the ambition of the
              project, was that they were not better
              anticipated.</strong></span></p>
              <p>With problems overcome through some remarkable defence science
              and assistance from the U.S., the submarines were delivered close
              to budget and an average of 26 months behind schedule.</p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>This is one of the
              shortest delays with any military purchase and remarkable for the
              largest systems integration project in Australian
              history.</strong></span></p>
              <p>The persisting failure has been the combat system, a testament
              to both the inadequacies of some of the world's major arms
              corporations and the unchecked ambition of Australian
              submariners.</p>
              <p>Even this disaster was <strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">salvaged by the expertise and ingenuity of
              Australia's project engineers and defence scientists, cobbling
              together a system to provide an acceptable
              performance.</span></strong></p>

              Steel, Spies and Spin.</strong></p>
              <p>The Australian navy has six Collins Class submarines, designed
              by the Swedish company Kockums, and built by the Australian
              Submarine Corporation at Adelaide between 1989 and 2003. The
              construction of the Collins class submarines was Australia's
              largest and most controversial military purchase. The submarine
              project was subjected to an unprecedented level of media scrutiny
              and criticism, became highly politicised and on several occasions
              faced the prospect of being abandoned.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The general public perception of the submarine project is that
              it was a hugely expensive failure and that the submarines are noisy
              'dud subs'. While I am far from being an apologist for the navy, it
              is amazing how wrong this perception is. The submarines were indeed
              expensive - all modern weapons are expensive - but the submarine
              project was one of Australia's few modern military purchases in
              which the initial budget was still relevant at the end of the
              project. The submarines were a financial success.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The Collins submarines had technical problems - all new and
              complex machinery has teething problems - <strong>but the general
              belief that they are 'noisy as a rock concert' is wrong. The
              reality is that they are probably the second-quietest submarines in
              the world, with the only quieter ones being the Swedish Gotland
              class, Kockums' next design after the Collins class. <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">The
              minor noise problems of the early submarines, as with the other
              mechanical issues, have long since been
              solved.</span></span></strong></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>However, the submarines suffered from one major defect which the
              media and the public never really picked up on. The combat system -
              that is the computer systems in the submarine used to find enemies
              and fire torpedoes or missiles at them - has been by far the
              largest problem for the Collins class submarines. The earlier
              Oberon class submarines had a largely Australian-built combat
              system which was one of the best in the world. When our submariners
              began planning the combat system for the new submarines, they
              naturally wanted an even better one. However, what they asked for
              proved to be too hard to build and the combat system never worked
              properly - in fact it was never finished - and it was abandoned in
              2000.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The navy then ran a competition to select the best available
              combat system already in operation in foreign submarines - a
              competition won easily by a European electronics company. However,
              the result was overturned by the coalition government, which
              insisted that our submarines had to have an American combat system.
              As the Americans did not have a combat system suitable for
              non-nuclear submarines, the consequence was that it was not until
              2007 that our submarines began to be fitted with a combat system of
              the standard hoped for when the submarines were designed back in
              the 1980s.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">The media and the public
              (and even to a surprising extent, the navy) never understood the
              sheer scale, complexity and risk of the submarine project. Building
              submarines is hard and getting harder - far harder than building
              aeroplanes, the closest analogy is perhaps with space ships. To
              build a hull to withstand extreme water pressures has always been
              demanding but the increasing complexities of electronics and
              computer systems make modern submarines among the greatest of
              engineering challenges. Even countries with long histories of
              submarine construction often have problems, while countries
              attempting to build submarines for the first time regularly
              experience disasters. Dilapidated or abandoned shipyards from
              Buenos Aires to Bombay, littered with the relics of failed
              submarine projects testify to the magnitude of the
              challenges.</span></strong></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The submarine project was taken up with great enthusiasm by the
              Hawke government in the 1980s as a major nation building endevour
              to revitalise Australian manufacturing. Consequently the submarines
              were built in Australia rather than overseas and over 70% of the
              money spent on the submarines was spent in Australia - a far higher
              proportion than with most military purchases. The end result of the
              project is a squadron of submarines that are among the best
              conventional submarines in any navy in the world and rank with the
              F111s as Australia's most potent weapons. <strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">The Collins Class submarines were an
              extraordinary engineering achievement and it is testimony to the
              power of politics and the popular press (lionnoisy) that they are
              regarded as a disaster</span></strong>.</p>
              <p>Australia leads the way in Submarine development, not STK!</p>
              <br> Everything else is speculation, mostly regarding what the new
              platform will be, hell <a rel="nofollow" href="http://informationdissemination.blogspot.com/2007/12/navantia-design-to-contend-as-collins.html"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #336699;">we've
              done a bit of our own</span></span></a>. In reality though, if you
              are looking towards an existing design as a contender for the
              Collins replacement, you are probably looking in the wrong
              place.<br> <br> <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.abc.net.au/pm/stories/s32901.htm"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #336699;">The Collins class had a tough
              start</span></span></a>, was given a bad reputation, and to this
              day is one of the least understood weapons of war taxpayers in
              Australia probably do recognize by name. Perception drives the
              reality of the media, and in general the media misses the mark
              today when it talks about the Collins class submarines.<br> <br> <span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>The truth is, the Collins
              class submarine is one of the best submarines in the world,
              anywhere.</strong></span> Only Japan and the United States are
              realistically contenders in a match game debate, it really is that
              good. <span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>Any American submariner
              who has served on a Seawolf or Virginia class submarine would feel
              comfortable in a Collins, the same tech exists. In fact, the same
              strike packages exist, the same mission profiles exist, and in many
              ways they handle the same roles for their respective services. The
              only real difference is the propulsion system and the
              size.<br></strong></span><br> The Collins class may not be nuclear, <span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>but it is a fleet
              submarine</strong></span>. We have recently learned thanks to
              released documents that if they were allowed, Australian
              submariners could tell more than a few stories of <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.theage.com.au/news/national/secret-spy-missions-forced-to-the-surface/2006/09/07/1157222265317.html"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #336699;">cold
              war operations deep into Russian waters</span></span></a> in the
              Pacific, and it is a good bet if they did it with older submarine
              platforms, they will conduct the same mission profiles with the
              Collin class, and the Collins class replacement.<br> <br> There is a lot of speculation regarding what the requirements of
              the Collins class replacement will be. From my discussions with
              people who do know, this is all we actually know..., it will not be
              like anything on the market today outside the US, and when 2011
              comes, we will only hear the generic details. We can only count on
              three specific requirements leading the design focus: Fuel cell
              technology, high energy requirements, and it will operate as an
              underwater mothership for both manned and unmanned deployable
              systems. There is currently nothing in the market that meets those
              requirements outside of the US, and sense it is unlikely Australia
              will go nuclear with its submarines, <span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>it means there is</strong></span> <a rel="nofollow" href="http://informationdissemination.blogspot.com/2007/10/future-of-underwater-warfare.html"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>nothing in the market designed
              today</strong></span></span></a> <span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>likely to be the Collins submarine
              replacement.</strong></span><br> <br> Australia will introduce something new, likely to only be
              influenced by Japanese and American concepts and technologies. Of
              all the underwater programs under development today, if you are
              looking for the next 'game changer' in underwater warfare, the
              Collins class submarine replacement program is the program to keep
              your eye on.</div>
