            <div class='col-md body'>I am a great fan of Russian military aircraft most notably the Su-27 and Mig-29 series. They look so much better than the Western aircraft. They are also without a doubt more maneuorvable as compared to the F-15 and F-16 planes.<br><br>Therefore if one day these aircraft are allowed to be equipped with Isareli avonics ,Western radar and allowed to be armed with both the best of Western and Russian weapons, this will be the best combination! These east- west combi aircraft may be cheaper and at the same time more powerful than the pure western counterparts! They may continue to be carrier capable planes even after modifications as both Mig-29(one of the versions but not sure which one) and Su-30 is currently capapable!   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>PLAAF is having a hard time to maintain their Sukkoi 30 fleets. The maintenance required a lot of skills and $$$ (inventory); as the russian components usually have a lower MTBF (Mean Time Btw Failure). In addition, the Russian engines are very hungry for fuel and required more frequent check compare to the US P&amp;W or GE engines onboard F15. This is very cruical factor in deciding the operation status and "uptime" of the fighter squad in the battlefield.<br><br>F15 is a logical choice. We need not to face off with the Su35, at least not in the immediate future. By the time, our F15 already have few tricks on their sleeves. The F16 fighter pliot could be easily cross train for the F15 as well. This will reduce the lead time for the F15 squad to become fully operational.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>The Russian keep their AL-31F engines and related technologies close to their chest. It is very difficult for SG to obtain a license to produce the engine locally. It would be nightmare for RSAF if the Al-31F engines run out of stock or supply being disrupt during wartime. The PLAAF has been trying very hard to stockpile their AL-31 engines for possible cross-straits conflict in the near future, but Russians had been "regulating" the flow of the engine spares to PLAAF. Thus, the operation readliness of PLAAF Sukkoi is really a concern, given the low MTBF of the AL31 engines, compare to the P&amp;W or GE engines.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Yes Shotgun, i know of that proposal as well. I believe he have a valid point. The point he made is that the Superhornets used to act as an interim replacement for the F-14 are still significantly smaller as compared to the F-14. . This is despite the fact that the Superhornets are the largest in the F-18 class. The F-14 is around the same size as the Su-30 which the Russian navy carriers used. He claims that being smaller in size the amount of weapons carried and range is lesser as well. I am no expert but i think this is a very logical conclusion. I think his proposal is very practical given that the low cost of the Russian aircraft and the obvious superior maneouvability of these planes. Unfortunately he is being brushed off due to political reasons.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"></div>

Still strange to me how they are replacing an agile dogfighter (F14) with a less agile aircraft (F18E).<br><br>True, most air-to-air is at AMRAAM range now, but you never know.

            <div class='col-md body'>Well, I guess maybe the Americans figured that agility doesnt count as much as it did in air combat today.  Most engagements are BVR, so really tight turning dogfighters aren't as useful anymore.  It has always been a weight issue.<br><br>More high tech gizmos the aircraft its carrying, its heavier and cant turn as tight.  But if those hi tech gizmos are worth their weight, then i guess its okay to forfeit a bit of manueverability.<br><br>True enough, the flankers are more agile in the air than the SuperBugs, but the Superbugs pack more sophisticated ECM, AESA Radars etc etc.<br><br>Besides, the sheer amount of Superbugs required to replace the tomcats... thats a lot of jobs! In the end, I figured they'd rather give their own people more jobs than to give it to the Russians.<br><br>Superbugs aren't as manueverable, but, they retain energy better. In a typical F-16 vs Superbug scenario, the F-16s' manueverability advantage will only last for a while.  While the Superbug can hold its energy, wait for the F-16 to quickly bleed off his in hope for quick kill.  Once its energy its bled off, the superbug can then finally out turn its adversary to set up for the kill.<br><br>Good luck against flankers and fulcrums tho... those bastards can tolerate extremely high AOA, can with their brute force AL-31s, they'll still be able to bring their nose to close enuff to shoot.<br><br>I believe the Americans bought quite a few Flankers and Fulcrums.  One of those many black projects to dissect Eastern Bloc aircraft to study.  I used to have this rare pic of a flanker that carried US NAVY markings... awesome sight.</div>
