            <div class='col-md body'>I feel i gotta say this...that for the past few years our top military commanders are quite young. Certainly they are like "Xiao Di Di or Ah Di" compared to most "lao chiao" service chiefs around the world, let alone our neighbours  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_confused.gif" alt="Confused" title="Confused"><br><br>Needless to say, most of these young chaps are scholars. Surely we must have CDF material among 'farmer' officers right? i mean look at Tommy Franks the Centcom Commander who fought the Afghanistan and Iraq wars...he rose from the ranks from the Vietnam War, only to get degrees along the way. The former israeli CDF Shaul Mofaz joined the IDF zahal and fought as a paratrooper in the 6-Day war. We are talking about donkey years<br><br>Is the SAF culture churning out to-be perm secs or warriors studs?<br><br>Any views?</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote>SAF r like tt.. wat can we do? the higher educated u are, the higher u can climb</blockquote>Well, considering Singaporeans did not part take in any real frontline battles or war there's just no better way to find out who is more suitable to be an officer. If you can't have experience, you'd have to settle for academic results.  At least with more education you can trust the person a little more to have a plan in an crisis.<br><br>Besides, no matter how much training you give a guy you can never prepare him for the event when their comrades are screaming bloody murder from a fatal wound or seeing friends scattered all over the landscape.</div>
