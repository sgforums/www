They essentially policemen under SPF, perhaps their closest link with SAF would be those Gurkhas in charge of Pulau Tekong's security wearing the British woodland camo uniform... even that they're still policemen... those that did their BMT in Pulau Tekong would know... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"><br><br>The Gurkhas are well-trained and displayed the courage, self restraint and professionalism for which they are famous and were intially recruited into the SPF due to a fact that a impartial force is required to deal with any racial conflict that may arise in our society... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>After WW2, what did the British use the Gurkhas here for?<br><br><strong>Internal Security.</strong><br><br>They were the ultimate enforcers of Internal Security for Singapore. They were used effectively to fight the communist CPM in Emergency. They were used to fight the Indonesian in Konfrontasi. And they were used to enforce law and order during the race riots.<br><br>They will be there functioning and fighting while all else breaks down.<br><br>The reason the Gurkhas are here today has not changed. They are still the ultimate Internal Security enforcers.<br><br>Yes, we have SAF, SPF... but we also have the Gurkhas just to "make sure" everyone stays in line.<br><br>Why do they wear the British DPM?<br><br>First of all, very clearly to set them apart. They are NOT part of SAF.. And they are an autonomous force within the SPF.<br><br>If there is a coup by SAF or SPF, the Gurkhas will be the only ones definitely still fighting for the authorities.<br><br>Secondly, I guess the British DPM is chosen cos they may still be led by British officers. I once saw a green Rover along AMK Ave 1 - but somehow different model from the SAF ones. It was stopped on the road one early morning around 6. Behind the Rovers were some men in British DPM with camo scarves and jungle hats. One chap was big and tall and from a distance I couldn't see exactly but he was too huge to be Asian. So must be Brit.<br><br>This would show that the Gurkhas may wear the SPF uniform for most duties but they remain British-trained and led mercenaries.<br><br>I wonder what their roles will be in times of war?<br><br>During Konfrontasi, the Brits sent them to Borneo. Even the fearsome and blood-thirsty Kopassus (Indo cdo) were no match for them. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br><br>One interesting thing that I still remember having read about them was that they do not use soap when fighting in the jungle during Emergency and Konfrontasi. This is because the smell of soap on their bodies can betray their presence and also spoil their own sense of smell in detecting enemy presence. I remember thinking these people must be like bloodhounds or something.</div>

You should've seen them standing outside Raffles City during that event last year.  Some were standing under the hot sun yet they stood there ramrod stiff despite packing a MP5, a sidearm, this huge bulky thing attached to their thigh &amp; of course their signature kukri knife.

When they are ordered to shoot, they must shoot, even if its civilians. Or else, their officer would shoot them. Any one can justify this?</div>

Gurkhas are a community found in Nepal and India. They are a majority in Nepal. They are also live in some of the states in India. Gurkas mostly speak the Nepali langauage.<br><br>As far as recruitment goes, I don't know much more about how selection is done in Singapore police force or the British forces. In India selection to its military is open to citizens of India, Nepal and Bhutan.<br><br>So Gurkhas from India as well as Nepal take part in the selection process. Only the best will get through. There is special Gurkha regiments in the Indian Army.<br><br>This website gives a detailed explanation about the Gurkhas and their service with various armies. Also note the Nepali army is full of Gurkhas.<br><br><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gurkha#Singapore_Gurkhas_Contingent" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gurkha#Singapore_Gurkhas_Contingent</a></div>
