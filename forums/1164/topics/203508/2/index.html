Didn't speak much English so nothing much else I could learn from them.<br><br>All Nepali troops carry the Kukri, and in Nepal they don't classify the soldiers as Gurkha or non-Gurkha. And everyone's surname is Gurung...OK not all, but it is the equivalent of the Tans and Lims in SG.<br><br>The biggest irony of Nepal is that though they produce the best fighters in the world, the army of Nepal is one of the weakest in the region.

Indian women are terrific beauties, too - just look at all the Miss World contests they have won. My slip of tongue. What I should mean is that a lot of Nepali girls are good-looking but with a slight difference in appearance.

But it is generally accepted that the Gurkhas are from Nepal - as people of the original Ghorka kingdom.<br><br>In that region there are a lot of migration back and forth. For example there is a large Tibetan community in Nepal and they have a lot of very ancient Tibetan stupas in Nepal. And Bhuddism is a recognised main religion of Nepal along with Hinduism. And there are now young generations of Tibetans in Nepal whom have never ever seen Tibet.<br><br>But you wouldn't say Tibetans are from Nepal, any more than you would say Ghurkhas come from India. A lot of Ghurkas in India have been born and bred there and never seen Nepal but that is because of the long service record of Ghurka soldiers in the Indian Army. But the originality of Ghurka is still Nepal.<br><br>There are many generations of Chinese in Singapore and Chinese is one of the main language here but if you tell someone Chinese people come from Singapore it would be very confusing.</div>

From what I heard, after a Gurkha retires from SPF, he has enuf $$ to last him thru old age.  A Gurkha retiring from Brit army still has to work when old to support himself.  </div></blockquote>Not true. Their salary is roughly that of a British soldiers. However, you are right that there was inequality - but that is in pension, etc. The problem is that there is some kind of agreement between Nepal, the UK and India that Gurkhas in the British Army should not be paid too much. The worry is that they might bring their huge pensions back to their homeland.<br><br>Anyway, that seems to have been resolved already. Now Gurkhas in the UK IIRC serve under the same conditions as BRitish Soldiers.<br><br>IIRC a British Soldier who serves out his 22 year contract and attains WO rank will get about 10 000 GBP/year pension. Not too shabby.</div>

Hindusim is just a part of India like Bhuddism, Islam, Christianity, etc.<br><br><strong>But you wouldn't say Tibetans are from Nepal, any more than you would say Ghurkhas come from India.

But in India we consider them as Indians since our relation is not a few year relation but a historic one. There are many Tibeteans in India, those who fled the communist China and their children who are citizens of India.<br><br><strong>There are many generations of Chinese in Singapore and Chinese is one of the main language here but if you tell someone Chinese people come from Singapore it would be very confusing.</strong><br><br>Chinese civilisation is an age old civilisation like the Indian civilisation.
