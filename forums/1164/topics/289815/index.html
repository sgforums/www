            <div class='col-md body'>The English Longbow. Traditional Mongolian bows were developed by Genghis Khan to have an advantage over his enemies in terms of range. However, if you were to look at the chronology, the English longbow was developed much later, had the mongols had better bows, it would have been adopted, yet it was not. The English longbows typically had a poundage of more than 100lbs. Competition recurve bows currently has only about 44-52lbs. The French hated the English archers, the mere capture of one archer would render his middle finger cut off, hence the gesture adopted by the english of the "2 fingers" as the English version of "showing the finger".</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>When we are talking about Mongolian bows, the first thoughts go the their military use, although hunting and target practice certainly were more prominent activities. Every day was not filled with war, but hunting and the training of various skills were part of the daily routine. However, we will start with the military aspect.<br><br>In the military, each soldier carried two bows on horseback. One bow was for long-range shooting, another for shooting at close distances. Also, each soldier had two quivers with arrows for different purposes. To mention but a few of these, there were armor-piercing arrows with a particularly heavy arrowhead of tempered steel, there were incendiary arrows for setting buildings afire and spreading fear in the enemy ranks, as well as whistling arrows for signalling. Of course, the majority of arrows they carried were ordinary arrows where the arrowhead and length of the shaft were adjusted to the normal range at which the particular type arrow was to be used.<br><br>The Mongol bow is not as large and long as the English one, but it is vastly more powerful. The draw weight of an English longbow averages around 70-80 pounds, whereas the Old Mongol bow had a pull that, according to George Vernadsky, averaged at around 166 pounds. Chambers states that the pull varied from 100 to 160 pounds. This seeming discrepancy certainly reflects the fact that draw weight varied with the strength of the user, and with what use the bow had been made for. As could be expected, there was a considerable difference in shooting range. Whereas the English longbow could shoot at distances up to 250 yards or around 228 meters, the Mongol counterpart can hit its target at 350 yards or 320 meters and, if the archer is well trained for the task, even beyond that.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>However the range of the mongol horse archer was a mere 60-120 yards because without feet planted on solid ground they could only pull much much less.<br><br>But yes the compound recurve bow has a better pull strength then the low bow.<br><br>Then again u really have to look at what kind of trees were available and the conditions/climate of the places where the bows were used and hence u would get varying results.<br><br>Certain woods snap easily when in drier conditions where as others become to soft when wet.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I doubt you can compare directly the various types of bows as described in the pics. These bows are designed and exploited with respect to the doctrine, tactics, availability of materials and geography of the terrain........<br>Like the pic of the mongolian archer, his bow must be short so as to ensure the flexibility of the user on horseback.........<br><br>I have read a book by Joseph needham a sinologist regarding the ancient Chinese usage of ballistics weapon. According to him, longbows are already in wide usage back in the 200BC. On top of that, crossbows were also widely used as early back in the Qin era. Crossbows though short in range, allows a heavier blow against a enemy at close range. Thus it is popular among the Chinese army as the time needed to train the user is shorter and it can penetrate the wooden shields used by the xiongnu.<br><br>A special type of crossbow known as "zhuge nu" was also created slightly later than Qin era, but it's creation is wrongly attributed to Zhuge liang. It is known as "lian nu" repeated crossbows. They have 5 bolts housed in a wooden built in magazine that allows the bolts to fall into the chamber when the bolt is fired, thus saving the time on reloading.<br><br>According to the book, the may difference between Chinese crossbow and western crossbow is that western bows fired full length arrow and deploys as complicated crank system, thus no doubt the range is slightly further than the Eastern design. The eastern design is more simple and more rapid in terms of firing.</div>
