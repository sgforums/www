            <div class='col-md body'><p>Hey guys, i'm just going to go straight into it. I dropped out of sec 4 when i was 15 because i was bullied.My family and I moved abroad after that and i went to an international school to get my highschool diploma, halfway through CMBP/Mindef told me i would have to return to SG to serve NS, i went back on April 2014 for NS registration and Medical checkup. <br><br>Basically i'm stuck in Singapore alone till the enlistment and i don't have a highschool diploma .I know i need a highschool diploma to study abroad in a Uni after NS . I don't plan to stay or live in SG , the only reason i'm here is to serve NS. I want to know what's the fastest route for me to get out of SG and back to my family. If anyone could take your time to read and reply i would really appreciate it !<br><br>Honestly i feel lonely and lost , i just want to be with my family. But i'm also thinking about my future , i have no highschool diploma , i cannot enter any Uni/College without it . I plan to either go back to finish highschool abroad or take O's on 2015 as i don't have enough money for it this year.<br><br>1: Are there any dangers of entering NS with Sec 3 being my highest qualification?<br>2: Should i take O's after or before NS?<br>3: When is the earliest i can enlist? I'm 17 turning 18 on Dec.<br><br>I apologize in advanced if this is confusing<br></p></div>

              <p>There are a few things you nee do know:</p>
              <p>1.  You can study high school overseas.  I am a Singaporean currently living in United States (I finished my NS and came to US when my company transferred me to California during the dot-com boom).  My wife, who grew up in Hong Kong, did this.  She came to California, did her high school, then did her university.</p>
              <p>2.  There are no "dangers" with NS, period.  It is like an extended summer camp with uniforms.  Just don't be stupid (eg. playing with your firearm while cleaning it), and you'll do alright with whatever your education is.</p>
              <p>3.  Since you're very close to enlistment, you might not have time to finish your O level.  So I will wait a bit if I were you.</p>
              <p>4.  Check with CMPB, I believe once you turn 18 it'll just be a few months away.  Take the time now to get fit to make things a little easier.  Who knows, you might meet good friends in NS and those will be the best 2 years of your life.</p>
              <p>After you have finished your NS, you will still be required to serve in the reserves until the age of 40 (or 45 of officers if I recall correctly).  Here, you will have to make a decision. </p>
              <p>In order for you to join your family overseas, you will need permission from MINDEF to leave Singapore and stay overseas.  Meaning, you will have to show that you are enrolled in a school, or is employed overseas.  If not, you cannot stay overseas for extended periods of time.</p>
              <p>If you tell yourself "screw this crap, I don't want to deal with this", you can apply for and get citizenship from another country and renounce your Sigapore citizenship. Remember that you'll need to show your new country's passport before you can renounce your Singapore citizenship.</p>
              <p>My recommendation:  Don't be hasty and make a rash decision you'll regret.  Making a living overseas isn't as easy as most Singaporeans think it is.  Finish your NS, learn to be independent, then make an informed decision.</p>

              <p>Dear Zee09,</p>
              <p>Serving NS is compulsary be it if have qualification or not. Having a good mental health whn you enlist is important. Please try to speak to your Officer or Senior Specialist or request for a professional counselor. The Officer and Senior Specialist only have been through some counselling courses but if youhave deep problem, they can't assist you professionally. Try to get to seek reliable help by going throught the proper channel when you enlist.</p>
              <p>All the Best and Keep a Good Mental Health!</p>

            <div class='col-md body'><p>You guys have no idea how thankful i am, thank you for replying! <br><br>I have 2 passports , when i returned to SG for medical checkup. They were suppose to arrest me at the airport, but because i didn't use my SG passport they didn't know i was back till i went to the police station to change my IC Address and they arrested me. Long story short, fine for not applying for exit permit with Mindef. I can easily go back right now with my other passport and never return to SG, i think i'm thinking this way because i'm depressed and i miss my family. I've never been depressed , this is the only time. I feel like i'm wasting 2 years of my youth, i'm just so lost.<br><br>I plan to serve NS as i'd want to travel safely in the future , but the only thing i'm worried about is my future. I plan to study in America/Canada after NS but i'll need my O's to do so. I don't know who to ask for help , i called Mindef and they told me i could only be granted deferment if i could enroll in the school. Problem is , school on starts on 2015 jan , i found a private school that starts on Oct 2014 . <br><br>So my birthday is on Dec, which means i would probably go in on March ? That means i'll be 20 when i'm out with no highschool cert.. I'm really worried about this . Or should i just ask them if i could defer for a year and take O's before i enter? <br><br>I've also asked Mindef about the 2month reduction , if i get a gold/silver i'll only need to serve 1 year 10 months, i'm confident in getting gold.<br><br>I don't think they'll allow a 20 year old to enter a highschool abroad.</p></div>

              BMT</span></strong><br> This 9-week programme trains combat-fit recruits in the basic
              military skills to prepare them for advanced vocational training.
              The programme includes weapon training with the SAR 21 rifle which
              will teach recruits technical handling and marksmanship skills; a
              Battle Inoculation Course that simulates a real battlefield; a
              Field Camp which develops basic survival skills; progressive
              training to complete a 24-km route march which builds combat
              fitness and endurance; and hand grenade training.<br> <em><span style="font: inherit;">For those who fail to achieve the

              BMT</span></strong><br> As evidence has shown that obese recruits are able to achieve
              optimum fitness levels and weight loss in about 19 weeks, the new
              BMT programme for recruits with Body Mass Index (BMI) scores
              exceeding 27.0 will be 19 weeks. This BMT programme is designed to
              help obese recruits improve their physical fitness progressively
              while equipping them with basic soldiering skills and
              knowledge.</p>

              for recruits who are medically fit for deployment in selected
              combat and combat support vocations, such as signal operators,
              combat medics and naval system operators. These recruits will be
              given a new medical classification of PES B2, in place of the
              existing PES C1 classification. This is to ensure that the medical
              classification of our soldiers is consistent with their deployment.
              The new 9-week programme will include customised physical training,
              as well as basic combat training to prepare them for their combat

              training to prepare them for combat service support vocations, such
              as service medic, and those related to logistics and

              <p><span style="background-color: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0);">Perhaps
              you should also talk to your family members and friends who have
              lived the NS experience. The more you discuss with others, the more
              comfortable and mentally prepared you’ll become.</span></p>
              <p><strong style="font: inherit; background-color: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0);">Because
              NS life is different from civilian life before enlistment, there

              <p><span style="background-color: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0);">A good
              way to cope is to get support from your buddy and fellow recruits.
              They are going through the same tough training as you, so talking

              <p><span style="background-color: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0);">In most
              evenings during your leisure time, you’ll also have some time to
              call your family or loved ones to talk. They can give you emotional
              support during NS.</span></p>
              <p><span style="background-color: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0);">You can

              any problems you may have. If you have a personal or family problem
              that need to be addressed, do let the officer know—he may be able
              to give you some advice or time off to settle your
              problems.</span></p>
              <p><span style="background-color: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0);">Life in
              NS revolves around structure, routine and discipline. This helps us
              stay united as a uniformed organisation as well as imparts the
              rigours necessary to protect our nation and citizens.</span></p>
              <p><span style="background-color: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0);">This
              does not mean there is just work and no play. In fact, after a few

              soldier, one of the biggest adjustments you’ll have to make quickly
              is in regimentation and discipline.</strong></p>
              <p><span style="background-color: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0);">Being in
              a uniformed organisation, you’ll have to obey orders from your
              superiors. Thus some of you may feel a sudden lack of freedom to do
              what you want and you may find yourself having difficulties
              accepting authority initially.</span></p>
              <p><span style="background-color: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0);">Regimentation and
              discipline build strong character and toughness, so that you’ll be
              tough enough to handle difficult combat, crime-fighting or rescue
              situations without giving up or breaking down.</span></p>
              <p><span style="background-color: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0);">When you
              first enlist into NS, you may have concerns of being in a new
              territory, with new faces and new things to do. But don’t let this
              get to you. Just remember the saying that “when the going gets
              tough, the tough gets going”.</span></p>

              do to prepare yourself psychologically:</em></span></p>
              <ul>
              <li><span style="background-color: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0);">Adopt a

              <li><span style="background-color: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0);">Develop

              stress</span></li>
              <li><span style="background-color: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0);">Adopt
              teamwork spirit</span></li>
              <li><span style="background-color: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0);">Learn
              to be independent</span></li>
              <li><span style="background-color: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0);">Set

              </ul>
              <p><span style="background-color: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0);">You can
              also speak to your friends or family members who have been through
              NS. Ask them to share their stories. The sharing will help you
              reduce some of your fears, uncertainties and doubts.</span></p>
              <p><strong style="font: inherit; background-color: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0);">During
              NS you’ll be living with different people.</strong></p>
              <p><span style="background-color: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0);">Because
              these people come from different backgrounds, they may not think
              like you do or react to situations like you would. Instead of
              trying to select your type of people, you should cherish the
              diversity. This is a chance for you to learn more about your fellow
              mates and their cultures.</span></p>
              <p><span style="background-color: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0);">You’ll
              find that you have many opportunities to absorb the different
              cultures—during training, eating, chatting or just seeing and
              listening. Take these opportunities and learn from people around
              you, you’ll have a much better appreciation of Singapore’s cultural
              diversity.</span></p>

              </div>
              </div>
              <p>Story by Benita Teo</p>
              <p><strong>Serving in the military is certainly no mean feat. And
              when the security of the nation is in one’s hands, mental strength
              is as important as, if not more so than, physical
              fitness.</strong><br> <br> When the going gets tough, it is often helpful to talk it out with
              a trusted family or friend. But, even with the best of intentions,
              not everyone is able to fully comprehend the intricacies of
              military life.<br> <br> To help the servicemen and women of the Singapore Armed Forces
              (SAF) cope with the challenges of their military roles, the
              counsellors of the SAF Counselling Centre (SCC) are always ready to
              lend a listening ear. In fact, the team at SCC provides
              professional counselling services not only to all members of the
              Ministry of Defence (MINDEF) and SAF, but also to their
              families.<br> <br> <strong>Learning to live the military life</strong><br> <br> Unlike civilian counselling centres, the SCC comes under military
              mandate, and its primary purpose is to provide mental health care
              to ensure that servicemen are able to carry out their duties
              efficiently.<br> <br> Of the types of cases the SCC sees, Mrs Marlene Koh, Head of
              Education and Prevention Services, noted that the majority were
              Full-time National Servicemen (NSFs) with adaptation issues. "Not
              everybody is used to dealing with authority. They all came in as
              students who only had to take care of their own studies."<br> <br> She added: "The second, smaller group would be Regulars with career
              or family issues. A third group comprises families and soldiers
              affected by critical incidents that happened around them, for
              instance training incidents or a death in the family."<br> <br> Servicemen in distress may seek help directly with the SCC through
              two channels: face-to-face sessions or the 24-hour SAF Counselling
              Hotline. On top of these, a Family Support Helpline is also
              available for the family members of soldiers deployed overseas who
              are in need of assistance.<br> <br> <strong>Eyes and ears on the ground</strong><br> <br> To help junior and senior commanders to identify and assist men
              under their charge who are at risk of emotional distress, the SCC
              conducts regular workshops. In addition to basic counselling
              skills, stress management and suicide prevention are also taught at
              the workshops.<br> <br> Ms Cheryl Chia, an SCC counsellor with 14 years of experience,
              explained that equipping commanders with these skills is essential
              because "they are the eyes and ears on the ground".<br> <br> Another set of eyes that the SCC relies on to spot at-risk
              servicemen are the paracounsellors - Regulars who volunteer to help
              look after the mental welfare of servicemen at the unit level. To
              be appointed as paracounsellors, they have to go through a five-day
              course organised by the SCC that teaches basic counselling, suicide
              prevention and crisis management skills.<br> <br> Military Expert (ME) 3-3 Sulinder Singh, a Logistics Warrant
              Officer, has been a paracounsellor in his unit, 201 Squadron (SQN),
              since 2010. And being a familiar face in the unit means that
              servicemen know what to expect when they confide in him -
              trustworthiness.<br> <br> "I'm quite approachable, and they know that if they talk to me, it
              will be confidential."<br> <br> <strong>Allaying fears</strong><br> <br> Besides assuaging doubts over client confidentiality, the
              counsellors and paracounsellors also dispelled the stigma of
              seeking help.<br> <br> "(For) those who are in a position of command, it may be a 'face'
              issue," said SCC counsellor Lawrence Yap. "But so far, I've not
              encountered any clients (Regulars) who claimed that attending
              counselling affected their careers."<br> <br> ME3-3 Singh echoed his sentiments: "Is there a stigma attached to
              people in the unit who see paracounsellors? No, not at all. They
              are not mentally ill, we just need to help them find the right way
              to organise their thoughts."<br> <br> <strong>The counsellor is in</strong><br> <br> Help for a distressed soldier often begins with a visit to the
              Medical Officer (MO) with complaints of symptoms of stress. Said Ms
              Chia: "Usually they will say that they are unable to sleep or eat.
              When the MOs probe deeper and realise that the problem goes beyond
              a medical issue, they will refer them to us."<br> <br> At the SCC, the soldier will be assigned a counsellor. Through the
              sessions, counsellor and soldier will work together to identify the
              problems and set goals towards overcoming them. The counsellor will
              also impart skills such as stress or anger management
              techniques.<br> <br> When facing mental turmoil, a soldier may despair and lose his
              sense of self. One approach a counsellor may take is to remind him
              of his capabilities.<br> <br> "Counselling is about instilling a sense of hope," said Mr Yap, who
              specialises in substance and drug addiction counselling. "Everyone
              has it in them to overcome a difficult situation. We just need to
              help them see that they are not as helpless as they think they are,
              and that the situation is not as hopeless as they think it
              is."<br> <br> SCC counsellors also work with psychiatrists and psychologists from
              the Psychological Care Centre (PCC) at the SAF Medical Corps'
              Military Medicine Institute to provide all-round care to the
              soldier. PCC psychiatrists prescribe medication for conditions like
              depression while psychologists run tests to ascertain if a
              behavioural problem is linked to a learning or intellectual
              disability.<br> <br> <strong>Helping others help themselves</strong><br> <br> With the ever-evolving social landscape, counsellors must stay
              up-to-date on new behavioural problems or addictions, such as
              social media addiction.<br> <br> Mrs Koh also pointed out that there are now more cases of
              servicemen suffering anxieties about not performing well or meeting
              expectations, and that many expected others to solve their
              problems.<br> <br> Mr Yap agreed: "To change, clients have to take personal
              responsibility for their actions."<br> <br> Nonetheless, the counsellors take comfort in the knowledge that
              they are changing lives for the better.<br> <br> Mrs Koh remembered a recruit who had attempted suicide after his
              girlfriend of four years ended their relationship and started
              seeing a friend of his behind his back. Mrs Koh helped him
              acknowledge his feelings of hurt and disappointment, and taught him
              constructive ways of managing his anger.<br> <br> The recruit started to improve his relationship with his family and
              make new friends in his unit. Nine months later, he was finally
              able to move on from the break-up.<br> <br> Ms Chia also recounted a recent case: "I had a client who wanted to
              kill himself. But after working with his unit and the psychiatrist,
              just before his ORD (Operationally Ready Date) he said, 'You gave
              me hope. Even though life ahead will be challenging, at least I
              know now that there are people who care, and that there is more to
              life than thinking about hurting myself.'"<br> <br> She added: "He even baked us cupcakes as a 'thank you'. It's the
              little things like these (that let me know I’ve made a
              difference)."</p>

              <p>Handling a mentally ill soldier is not easy. They require proper
              attention and a suitable working environment for them to thrive,
              said psychiatrists contacted by The New Paper. For this to happen,
              the Singapore Armed Forces (SAF) has to take ownership of its
              soldiers, Dr Ang Yong Guan said.<br> <br> Dr Ang, who is in private practice, was the head of the
              Psychological Care Centre (PCC) at the Military Medicine Institute
              during his 23 years with the SAF from 1986 to 2003.<br> <br> He said that of his 4,500 patients, there are fewer than 10 cases
              of full-time national servicemen (NSF).<br> <br> "I forward each NSF's case to the SAF. I believe the organisation
              should be responsible for its own soldiers," he said.<br> <br> But he thinks that the majority of these cases do not get picked
              up.<br> <br> "(When I was at PCC) I always made it a point to monitor those
              soldiers who had severe mental illnesses. I would even call their
              private psychiatrists to find out more.<br> <br> "Only if the organisation's leaders are committed to monitoring and
              helping these patients can they be given the right attention and
              help," Dr Ang said.<br> <br> Consultant psychiatrist Ken Ung of Adam Road Medical Centre said
              that when a soldier is found to be mentally ill, steps should be
              taken to ensure he is placed in a suitable working
              environment.<br> <br> Dr Ung, who sees about 30 to 50 cases of NSFs a month, said that
              superiors and colleagues should also understand that problematic
              soldiers may not always be trying to play the system.<br> <br> BE UNDERSTANDING<br> <br> "There are cases where the superiors are very understanding and
              sympathetic towards their condition and always willing to listen to
              them, and (the patients) thrive," he said.<br> <br> But those who had difficult bosses could lead to a downward spiral
              of the soldier's condition, he said.<br> <br> "I've had such patients who became more and more depressed,
              constantly had nightmares. Parents would complain about their
              behaviour and some even had suicidal thoughts," he said.<br> <br> Superiors should give their subordinates the benefit of the doubt,
              said Dr Ung, adding that they should be proactive and take the time
              to find out if their soldiers are all right.<br> <br> "The SAF is a microcosm of society. It's inevitable that you will
              get soldiers who are mentally ill. So you should learn how to
              handle and manage them."<br> <br> The Ministry of Defence (Mindef) said in a statement on Tuesday
              that it will study the State Coroner's findings carefully to
              improve and tighten its procedures to ensure better compliance by
              Singapore Armed Forces units in dealing with soldiers with mental
              problems.<br> <br> This article was published on April 12, 2014 in The New Paper.</p>

              <p>The Institute of Mental Health (IMH) is a 2,000-bed acute
              tertiary psychiatric hospital situated on a 25-hectare
              campus at Buangkok Green Medical Park. Set amidst serene
              surroundings, IMH offers a comprehensive range of psychiatric,
              rehabilitative and counselling services for children, adolescents,
              adults, and the elderly.</p>
              <p>IMH’s tradition of care started in 1928. We were the first
              mental hospital in Singapore, starting with some 1,000 patients.
              Since then, many advances have been made in treatment, training,
              and research. Our treatment integrates evidence-based therapies,
              supported by the departments of clinical psychology, nursing,
              occupational therapy, and medical social work, to provide holistic
              care for our patients. IMH is equipped with modern facilities, with
              50 wards for inpatients and seven Specialist Outpatient
              Clinics.</p>
              <p>IMH was the first mental health institution in Asia to receive
              the Joint Commission International Accreditation in 2005, a highly
              coveted international accreditation for healthcare
              organisations. </p>
              <p>Over the years, IMH has gained a reputation for quality
              research. In 2008, the Ministry of Health,
              Singapore, entrusted IMH with a S$25 million research
              grant to implement translational and clinical research into the
              causes of schizophrenia and related psychotic disorders.</p>
              <p>IMH also plays a key role in training the next generation of
              mental health professionals in Singapore. We train psychiatrists
              and mental health professionals through the NHG-AHPL Residency
              Programme for psychiatry and through collaborations with the local
              tertiary institutions.</p>

              NS obligations in full, a longer jail sentence to reflect the
              period of NS he has evaded may be appropriate.</li>

              <p> </p>

              three years' imprisonment, but they are usually held in a
              low-security detention facility and separated from other
              conscription offenders. The government does not consider <a title="Conscientious objector" rel="nofollow" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conscientious_objector">conscientious

              1972, the publications of Jehovah's Witnesses have been outlawed in
              Singapore. This is commonly misinterpreted to mean that Jehovah's

              <p> <strong>2LT Sherman Pay, ROS Commander with 128 Squadron,
              RSAF</strong></p>
              <p>It was to be a decision many Singaporean boys who have grown up
              overseas, would have to make – whether to return home to Singapore
              and serve National Service (NS). Not necessarily an easy decision
              for any 19-year-old Singaporean; not when you’ve lived the last 11
              years of your life overseas. </p>
              <p><strong>Home Away from Home</strong></p>
              <p>For Sherman Pay, home had been in the Chinese city of Xiamen in
              Fujian province where he lived with his family. They would return
              twice a year to visit their relatives, often during Chinese New
              Year and the summer holidays. Save for his relatives, Sherman had
              hardly any friends in Singapore. Not surprising, given that he had
              spent most of his growing up years away from Singapore.</p>
              <p><a class="thumbed_image" rel="lightbox" href="http://www.overseassingaporean.sg/userfiles/blog/images/IMG_2290%283%29.jpg"><img style="width: 380px; height: 318px;" src="http://www.overseassingaporean.sg/userfiles/blog/images/IMG_2290%283%29.jpg" alt="" width="288" height="241"></a></p>
              <p><em>Sherman is ‘focused and ready’!</em></p>
              <p>His parents had made known their preference for the family to
              remain as Singaporeans. He recalled his mother signing him up for
              tours that took him around Singapore’s landmarks during his visits
              back as a child.</p>
              <p>While serving NS, Sherman lives with his uncle. However, being
              away from his immediate family does take its toll: “Sometimes I
              really miss them. I have learned to appreciate them more,
              especially  when I am feeling lonely. There would be times
              when I feel really down. But for me, my mom had brought me up to be
              independent and that really helped”.</p>
              <p>‘<strong>What-Ifs’ and ‘How-Woulds’</strong></p>
              <p>Prior to Sherman’s decision to return home to serve NS, his
              parents had concerns. Their uneasiness rubbed off on Sherman as
              well: “My mom was worried that I might get bad influence as there
              were people from all walks of life serving NS. She was also afraid
              that I couldn’t blend in and it would be hard for me to make
              friends. I was worried that I would be quite alone as I didn’t have
              friends (in Singapore) to begin with. I didn’t know how physical it
              (NS training) would get as I didn’t have my physical education
              here, so I didn’t know how (physically) fit I was compared to
              Singaporeans here. I didn’t know if I could keep up with the
              physical standards. My mum was worried about cultural differences
              because I don’t interact with Singaporeans that often. She was also
              worried I may not adapt to it.”</p>
              <p><a class="thumbed_image" rel="lightbox" href="http://www.overseassingaporean.sg/userfiles/blog/images/MVI_2531.jpg"><img style="width: 410px; height: 250px;" src="http://www.overseassingaporean.sg/userfiles/blog/images/MVI_2531.jpg" alt="" width="288" height="175"></a><br> <em>All geared up behind the ROS</em></p>
              <p>As for his father, he was worried as to whether Sherman was both
              physically and mentally strong enough to endure the training and
              demands of a soldier and if he might be bullied by his platoon
              sergeants. “I think it was because he believed Army trainings mean
              harsh treatments by the sergeants, but in reality, the trainings
              are carried out professionally with safety as a priority,” Sherman
              says with a grin. It helped that Sherman had Singaporean friends
              he’d grown up with in Xiamen who’d returned ahead of him to serve
              NS and they were able to cope well in NS.</p>
              <p><strong>Flying High In Many Ways</strong></p>
              <p>Sherman has been doing well in NS since his enlistment two years
              ago. The well-respected officer with the Republic of Singapore Air
              Force (RSAF) is addressed by his men and superiors in the 128
              Squadron as ‘2LT Sherman Pay’. He makes no qualms about aspiring to
              be an officer prior to his enlistment. “I have a few cousins who
              went to OCS (Officer Cadet School), so they told me, ‘If you can,
              try to be an officer as the experience would be more enriching.’
              Therefore that was my goal during BMT; I was very motivated.”
              Despite the initial anxieties, Sherman felt that serving NS has
              been a good and positive experience for him and it has made him
              mature from a boy to a man.</p>
              <p><br> It wasn’t just a positive attitude and hearing about success
              stories that got Sherman geared up for life in military fatigues.
              He credits his superiors who were very supportive and maintained an
              open communication channel with him during his Basic Military
              Training (BMT): “My supervisors did a good job. My OC (Officer
              Commanding) in BMT (Basic Military Training), he tried to engage us
              overseas Singaporeans, on enlistment day and told us that if we had
              any problems, if we couldn’t blend in, to look for him and he would
              help us. When we’re down, he’ll always motivate us. Although your
              family is not around, but during the time in NS, you have your
              so-called ‘brothers’, your bunkmates (and) they’ll also motivate
              you.” Yes, training will get tough, but the recruits will have to
              support each other to spur on and pull through together.</p>

              <p><em>Setting up the ROS</em></p>
              <p>These days, Sherman literally has a bird’s eye view on things
              through the videos by Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs), which would
              be fed back to the Receive-Only Station (ROS) that he operates with
              his team. The video feed, when relayed to the ground commanders,
              provides better battlefield situational awareness and enhances
              mission effectiveness.</p>
              <p><strong>Appraisal to be Well-Adapted</strong></p>
              <p>Sherman’s immediate supervisor Major (MAJ) Sam Ong, the OC in
              charge of ROS for 128 Squadron, says that Sherman has adapted very
              well in the Squadron. He believes Sherman’s positive experience in
              BMT and how those who had returned from overseas to serve NS were
              actively engaged by their superiors, set the foundation for a
              smoother transition for the recruits. “Those things are very
              important because the initial phase is when these overseas
              Singaporeans will need to adjust to the change in environment and
              that’s when engagement must come to the forefront. When Sherman
              came to the unit, I didn’t feel that he had any problems adjusting
              to the operational requirements of 128 Squadron. That foundation
              served him well and enabled him to adapt to the operational tempo
              without any difficulties” says MAJ Ong.</p>
              <p><a class="thumbed_image" rel="lightbox" href="http://www.overseassingaporean.sg/userfiles/blog/images/IMG_2347.jpg"><img style="width: 400px; height: 277px;" src="http://www.overseassingaporean.sg/userfiles/blog/images/IMG_2347.jpg" alt="" width="288" height="199"></a></p>
              <p><em>Sherman with Major Ong</em></p>
              <p>MAJ Ong regards Sherman as “a very outstanding NSF who’s not
              just able to lead when he’s required to, but he’s also a very
              capable team player. Sherman’s positive attitude and his
              willingness to take on challenges and overcome them will serve him
              well in the future”.</p>
              <p>Does MAJ Ong feel that Singaporean youths who return from
              overseas to serve NS are disadvantaged in some way? He doesn’t
              believe so as information is readily available in this age of
              connectivity and ease of access to the internet, where “you’re able
              to sift out information pertaining to NS. It’s this sense of
              wanting to find out what’s ahead that makes the difference. Perhaps
              years ago when information was limited, that would have made it
              more difficult for overseas Singaporeans to find out more about
              NS”.</p>
              <p><strong>Seeing Significance in NS</strong></p>
              <p>The most memorable event for Sherman was when he was
              commissioned as an officer. “My parents came back to attend my
              commissioning parade and they were very proud of me. After being
              commissioned as an officer, you will take up a leadership role. So,
              you’ll need to exercise a lot of your leadership skills. When you
              have to inspire people to be more capable beyond their normal
              abilities, make them go an extra mile, that’s when it feels very
              rewarding,” he says, beaming with a sense of accomplishment.</p>
              <p style="text-align: center;"><a class="thumbed_image" rel="lightbox" href="http://www.overseassingaporean.sg/userfiles/blog/images/IMG_2376.jpg"><img style="width: 450px; height: 300px;" src="http://www.overseassingaporean.sg/userfiles/blog/images/IMG_2376.jpg" alt="" width="288" height="192"></a> <br> <em>Posing beside a UAV</em></p>
              <p>How this contrasts to his initial scepticism of how serving NS
              would help in the defence of a small nation like Singapore. That
              faded after Sherman underwent the National Education programmes
              conducted by his supervisors. It then dawned on him the crucial
              role each serviceman, himself included, played in national security
              and the defence of Singapore. MAJ Ong believes that the key to
              creating a positive NSF experience is to make sure the NSFs
              understand and internalise their role in national defence”.</p>
              <p>But it is easy to think that two years serving NS is two years
              too long. In Sherman’s perspective, “If you think of your career,
              your studies, it’s a postponement of two years. So before I
              enlisted, I was also thinking, ‘You waste two years of your life.
              People already get their degrees and you’re still studying. People
              are already working’. But after I enlisted, I realised I learnt a
              lot during NS. I learnt about leadership, having a positive
              mindset, how to overcome hardship – these kinds of things. The
              experience was enriching in many ways, and in the end I felt I’ve
              become more mature and better equipped as a person. My two years in
              NS wasn’t wasted”.</p>

              <p>When we hear of National Service (NS), it is often assumed that
              it relates to the time spent with the army or the SAF, but that’s
              not always the case. “Growing up, my father always talked about the
              SAF and his time there, so I always thought that I would be joining
              the SAF. So when I received my enlistment letter and found out that
              I was to join the SCDF, I was definitely surprised!” Such was SGT
              (Sergeant) Raphael Tan’s initial response when the enlistment
              letter indicated that he was to join the Singapore Civil Defence
              Force for two years of NS. In this <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.overseassingaporean.sg/articles/d/ns-through-the-lens-of-an-overseas-singaporean-part-1">second issue</a> of ‘NS through the Lens of an
              Overseas Singaporean’, we met up with Raphael Tan, a Singaporean
              who lived abroad and came back home to serve NS in the SCDF.</p>
              <p>Since his birth, Raphael has had to adapt to both Western and
              Asian cultures due to his parents’ commitments in missionary work
              and overseas businesses. “I was born in Cardiff, Wales and spent a
              couple of years growing up in the UK and in Sweden before coming
              back to Singapore for pre-school. Following that, we left for
              Bangkok, Thailand in which I spent 13 years there.”</p>
              <p>When it was time to return for his NS stint and not knowing what
              to expect, a nervous Raphael went on to find out as much as he
              could about the Singapore Civil Defence Force. “Despite being a
              little worried, when I found out that they train fire-fighters, I
              was actually quite excited about it,” revealed the young sergeant.
              For those unfamiliar with the SCDF, this uniformed organisation
              belongs to the Ministry of Home Affairs and plays a critical role
              in Singapore by providing fire-fighting, rescue and emergency
              ambulance services. They also oversee the implementation of fire
              safety and civil defence shelter matters.</p>
              <p style="text-align: center;"><a class="thumbed_image" rel="lightbox" href="http://www.overseassingaporean.sg/userfiles/blog/images/photo%203%282%29.JPG"><img style="width: 620px; height: 363px;" src="http://www.overseassingaporean.sg/userfiles/blog/images/photo%203%282%29.JPG" alt="" width="288" height="168"></a><br>  <em>SGT Raphael Tan (left) demonstrating a training
              drill with two of his trainees</em></p>
              <p>When enlistment day arrived, a sense of uncertainty could be
              felt among the new recruits, “I was quite nervous but I wasn’t the
              only one because on the first day, you see many other nervous boys
              as well.” He was quick to reassure though, saying, “The instructors
              were quite kind and understanding as they were once in our shoes as
              well, so it wasn’t too bad actually.”</p>
              <p>What helped Raphael was that his overseas experience allowed him
              the opportunity to meet different people from diverse backgrounds.
              This made interacting with others in the SCDF much easier for him,
              especially when certain situations force you out of your comfort
              zone. “We had a training stint at Outward Bound in Sabah,” recalls
              Raphael, “and did hiking treks into dense jungles. A lot of us were
              placed out of our comfort zones and because of that, you could
              really see what people were really like. It was a real eye-opening
              experience where we learnt a lot about ourselves and of each
              other.”</p>
              <p>Following his basic training phase, Raphael is now a Fire and
              Rescue Specialist trainer. “I’m in the fire-fighting branch, so I
              instruct trainees on how to fight different kinds of fire.” Fires
              like flashovers and backdrafts are just some of the many thermal
              accidents that fire-fighters encounter and have to deal with. One
              of the ways to do that efficiently is to ensure that they are
              well-versed in their drills, in which our trainer/resident expert
              and his team will give you a sneak preview of in our <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADOJUT6TwBk"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">video.</span></a></p>
              <p>Having almost completed his two-year NS stint, Raphael now looks
              forward to becoming a Physical Therapist in the field of Sports
              Sciences and will take the skills that he has learnt from the SCDF
              with him wherever he goes. He reflects, “There are many things that
              I’ve gained from the SCDF and a lot of what I’ve learnt can be used
              in most emergency situations in our daily lives. I’ll bring along
              all these knowledge with me and touch wood, if I need to draw upon
              them one day, at least I’ll be mentally well-equipped.”</p>
              <p style="text-align: center;"><a class="thumbed_image" rel="lightbox" href="http://www.overseassingaporean.sg/userfiles/blog/images/photo%202%281%29.JPG"><img style="width: 620px; height: 424px;" src="http://www.overseassingaporean.sg/userfiles/blog/images/photo%202%281%29.JPG" alt="" width="288" height="196"></a></p>
              <p>While there are some who might still feel that NS is a
              hindrance, both to their career and study plans, to Raphael, NS is
              an opportunity to continue learning new life skills in an
              environment that is unlike any other. “You’re going to go through a
              lot of new experiences so take it all in and you’ll learn a lot of
              new things. Embrace it because a lot of what you will experience
              here, you won’t get a chance to do so outside of NS. Once you
              leave, you might just miss the time you’ve spent here.”</p>
