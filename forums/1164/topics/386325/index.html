              <p>Came across this news the other day......the US Military Veteran continue to provide  support leadership even as civilian.   </p>
              <p><span class="dateline">WACO, Texas —</span> Retired Col. Robert Lewis Howard, a man considered to be the country's most decorated soldier, died Wednesday. He was 70.</p>
              <p>Howard grew up in Opelika, Ala., and served in the Army from 1956 to 1992. He was part of the U.S. Army Special Forces, known as the Green Berets, and ran cross-border operations in Laos, Cambodia and North Vietnam. He was wounded 14 times in Vietnam and was awarded eight Purple Hearts.</p>
              <p>He was nominated three times for the Medal of Honor, the nation's most prestigious award for combat veterans. President Richard M. Nixon presented him with the honor at the White House in 1971 for his bravery in Vietnam during a mission to rescue a missing soldier in enemy territory.</p>
              <p>During that mission, the platoon was attacked. Howard tended to his wounded platoon leader while under fire and rallied platoon members into and organized defense force until rescue helicopters could land.</p>
              <p>"With complete disregard for his safety, 1st Lt. Howard crawled from position to position, administering first aid to the wounded, giving encouragement to the defenders and directing their fire on the encircling enemy. For 3 1/2 hours 1st Lt. Howard's small force and supporting aircraft successfully repulsed enemy attacks and finally were in sufficient control to permit the landing of rescue helicopters. 1st Lt. Howard personally supervised the loading of his men and did not leave the bullet-swept landing zone until all were aboard safely," according to his Medal of Honor citation.</p>
              <p>His other two nominations were downgraded, one to the Distinguished Service Cross and the other to the Silver Star.</p>
              <p>At a gathering earlier this year for Medal of Honor recipients, Howard said he and others given the medal don't wear their awards for themselves.</p>
              <p>"It is for all those who have and do wear the uniform of this great country of ours," Howard told the crowd. "For those who stood beside us and for those who did not come home."</p>
              <p>In April, Howard traveled to Iraq and Afghanistan to talk to troops. About two months ago he visited troops in Germany, Bosnia and Kosovo, the Express-News reported.</p>
              <p>"As one of America's most decorated veterans, Col. Howard inspired everyone he met to consider their own commitment to our nation's essential values, and was the bravest soldier I ever met," Texas Gov. Rick Perry said in a statement. "His unshakeable commitment to freedom, displayed in countless episodes of battlefield gallantry, lives on in the actions of our military men and women who continue to serve in hostile conditions overseas."</p>

              He was the most decorated living war hero whilst living. The honour of the most decorated war hero should be Joe Hooper. The most decorated in ww2 was Lt Audie L Murphy and ww1 was the famous Sgt York, both I believe also got more medals.
              
              Having said that, a lot of ex-US grunts have suspicions over the validity of medals provided in the Vietnam war.
