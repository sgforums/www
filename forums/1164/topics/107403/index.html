Such arrangements were already in place for S'pore usage until Malaysia abruptly withdrew permission during the Asian financial crisis, citing citizen complaints &amp; "congested air traffic."

            <div class='col-md body'>The use of Malaysian airspace i quite expected. Remember Mahathir said that in Singapore, when you drive your car at 4th or 5th gear, you'll fall off the sea. Fighter jets are the same, no matter which gear they fly, sure to intrude others territory because Singapore is so small. So opening their airspace i quite acceptable so can prevent war because of territorial intrusion.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"></div>

That's cuz the RSAF doesn't linger in their sphere all that much - let alone fly around like they own the place. Go read his press statement again; he's considering allowing Singapore to use Malaysian airspace <strong>en route to training areas.</strong><br><br>3rdly, let's backtrack a bit &amp; pinpoint where exactly the alleged intrusions took place. Most certainly, it couldn't be anywhere near KL or the PAS-controlled territories cuz the border's not there. Instead, it must be further south, at the tip of the peninsula.<br><br>I recall a series of localized complaints about low-level flight noise at Gelang Patah in west Johor (Second Link side of S'pore), which their federal authorities took umbrage on behalf of - noticeably within the generalized context of "violation of Malaysian airspace"- even after we worked out an arrangement to inform them in advance whenever we need to transit by.<br><br>Actually, Malaysia shows its hand whenever they mentioned "sovereignty rights" in the same breath (sometimes blatantly to their own media but which go unreported by the S'pore press): Pedra Branca is the relevant token, in the eyes of their federal government, of their perceived sense of territorial &amp; airspace integrity here. PAS argues for as much, though both get caught up with the nationalist fervour &amp; made muddle-headed contentions as a result.<br><br>Gosh, they were themselves urging for the same restraint as us when dealing with Indonesia over the Sipadan-Ligitan islands, as Jayakumar quoted in Parliament:<br><br>"... Until MalaysiaÂ’s claim is decided by the ICJ, the status quo must remain, consistent with MalaysiaÂ’s own position in the case of Sipadan/Ligitan. There, Malaysia adopted the position that as they were in possession of the islands, the status quo should prevail. For example, this is what they said in a diplomatic note to Indonesia on 3 January 1994, a note which they filed at the ICJ:<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">The Government of Malaysia reiterates that since Sipadan &amp; Ligitan are parts of Malaysia, any &amp; all activities undertaken by Malaysia on or pertaining to those islands &amp; their surrounding waters constitute legitimate exercise of its sovereignty &amp; jurisdiction. The continuing acts of intrusion by Indonesian naval vessels &amp; aircraft in MalaysiaÂ’s territorial waters &amp; airspace around Sipadan &amp; Ligitan similarly cannot in any way, advance IndonesiaÂ’s claim over the 2 islands.</span><br><br><a href="http://www.mfa.gov.sg/kl/speech.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.mfa.gov.sg/kl/speech.html</a><br><br>So, from the Singapore side: As if flying near Gelang Patah (with a bilateral protocol already in place) or flying past Pedra Branca (which we own according the status quo until the ICJ's decision) is really that provocative? Or are they merely using us as a bogeyman to score political points &amp; rally their own countrymen?</div>
