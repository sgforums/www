            <div class='col-md body'>New 094 SSBN photos as well as Google Earth images are confirming at least two 094 SSBN entering service.<br><br><img src="http://cache.orion.sina.com.cn/fansjczs_d/upload/52/7/1323390637/16400.jpg"><br><br>From  FAS.org update again:<br><br><blockquote><strong> Two More Chinese SSBNs Spotted</strong><br><br>By Hans M. Kristensen (BLOG UPDATED OCTOBER 10, 2007)<br><br><a href="http://www.fas.org/blog/ssp/2007/10/two_more_chinese_ssbns_spotted.php" rel="nofollow">http://www.fas.org/blog/ssp/2007/10/two_more_chinese_ssbns_spotted.php</a><br><br>China appears to have launched two more ballistic missiles submarines from the Bohai shipyard at Huludao approximately 400 km east of Beijing. This could bring to three the number of Jin-class (Type 094) nuclear-powered ballistic missile submarines (SSBNs) launched by China in the past three to four years.<br><br>The two submarines were discovered during analysis of newly published commercial satellite images on Google Earth. This is the second time in three months that FAS has discovered new Chinese ballistic missile submarines on commercial satellite images. The first time was in July 2007, when the first Jin-class was disclosed on the FAS Strategic Security Blog.<br><br><img src="http://www.fas.org/blog/ssp/images/JinSSBNs.jpg"><br>The submarines on the new image have the same dimensions as the previous submarine.<br><br>So How Many Do They Have?<br><br>Whether China has now launched two or three Jin-class SSBNs is still unclear. The image of the first SSBN discovered at Xiaopingdao in July 2007 was taken on October 17, 2006. The new image of the two SSBNs at Huludao was taken six and a half months later on May 3, 2007. One possibility is that the Xiaopingdao SSBN returned to Huludao for repair or further adjustment and was captured on the 2007 photo together with the second SSBN. Another possibility is that the two Huludao SSBNs are indeed the second and third boats of the new Jin-class SSBN.<br><br>The U.S. Office of Naval Intelligence estimated in December 2006 that "a fleet of probably five TYPE 094 SSBNs will be built in order to provide more redundancy and capacity for a near-continuous at-sea SSBN presence." China has not stated how many SSBNs it plans to build and there is no authoritative information available in the public that confirms that China plans to build five SSBNs. It might, but it might also build less if it decides that three or four are sufficient.<br><br>Some Implications<br><br>The new Jin-class SSBNs add to the single and unsuccessful Xia-class (Type 092) that China launched in 1982. The Xia has never conducted a deterrent patrol and its operational status is in doubt. The rapid launch of two or three Jin-class SSBNs indicate that the Chinese navy feels confident it has overcome at least some of the technical problems that curtailed the Xia.<br>Each Jin-class appears to have 12 launch tubes for the new Julang-2 sea-launched ballistic missiles that are currently under development. If Julang-2 and three Jin-class SSBNs become fully operational, it would enable China to deploy up to 24 ballistic missiles at sea, assuming one boat would be in overhaul at any given time (and the Xia is still not operational). The range of the Julang-2 is estimated by the US intelligence community at more than 8,000 km (4,970+ miles), which brings Hawaii and Alaska (but not the continental United States) within reach from Chinese territorial waters.<br>Despite many rumors on the Internet about multiple warheads on Julang-2, the long-held assessment by the US intelligence community is that the Julang-2 will be a single-warhead missile.<br><br>Whether China plans to deploy a continuous sea-based deterrent is unknown. It appears doubtful because it would break with the Chinese practice of not deploying fully operational nuclear missiles. Nuclear warheads for China's land-based missiles are believed to be stored separate from the missiles, although this has never actually been verified for the entire force. If the submarines deployed into the Pacific (like U.S. and to a smaller extent Russian SSBNs) it would also break with Chinese policy of not deploying nuclear weapons outside Chinese territory. An alternative would be to operate the SSBNs as a surge capability, intended to deploy in a crisis.</blockquote></div>

Considering the Yanks reported range of JL-2 SLBM only got 8000+kms? ThatÂ’s not enough to reach CONUS just from Chinese coastal water. Strategic patrol requires the SLBMs carried by 094 SSBN to be nuclear tipped. Which means for the 1st time, Chinese deploy Nuclear weapons outside their territory.<br><br>Submarine launched ballistic missile( SLBM) will have great survivability over old aged fix silo liquid fueled ICBMs, providing a credible 2nd nuclear retaliating ability.<br></div>

And she is not as silly as USSR to spend all it's time and money on building defense only. No doubt PRC can project naval power towards South china sea, but in terms of long term sustained long term projection, it is still not so possible.

It also reveals that the Type 094 design is equipped with 12 missile tubes aft of the fin - not the 16 originally speculated.<br><br>However, it remains unclear whether China has now launched two or three Jin-class SSBNs. The Federation of American Scientists (FAS), which claims credit for identifying the first Jin-class SSBN at Xiaopingdao submarine base from images taken last year by DigitalGlobe's Quickbird commercial satellite, states: "The image of the first SSBN discovered at Xiaopingdao in July 2007 was taken on 17 October 2006. The new image of the two SSBNs at Huludao was taken six-and-a-half months later on 3 May 2007.<br><br>"One possibility," states the FAS, "is that the Xiaopingdao SSBN returned to Huludao for repair or further adjustment and was captured on the 2007 photo together with the second SSBN. Another possibility is that the two Huludao SSBNs are indeed the second and third boats of the new Jin-class SSBN."<br><br>Western intelligence agencies are understood to have concluded that the most recent photograph shows the only two Jin-class boats currently in the water. However, they assess that additional Type 094 boats are in build at the Bohai yard.<br><br>243 of 563 words<br>Â© 2007 Jane's Information Group<br>End of non-subscriber extract</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I remember the time when the then Soviet Union has one of the most powerful military in the world........the US and Western Europe + Western allied countries were having jitters! Western Europe and US has war scenerios that in the event Soviet Forces rolled down Central Europe...[Central Germany and the plains]...the only way to take the Soviet led Warsaw Pact forces down was using Tactical Nukes and lay Central Europe to waste...<br><br>But now...........Soviet Union is non existant.....Russia is struggling to rebuild its' military to Soviet Union strength........so what does this tells us about China??<br><br>A country that has full of corruption.....no matter how comprehensive and aggressive its' military build up may be......that country will implode.....not today or next year......perhaps several years down the road....just wait and see lor... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br><br>Also Soviet Union is connected to Western Europe by a huge landmass [practically next door]. The Soviets, at the time, can sweep Western Europe off the map is they wanted to [Central Europe mostly flatlands, good country for tank warfare and lightning strikes].<br><br>China, practically surrounded by sea, except through South East Asia, Korea, Russia and other countries in the west [Central Asia]. Not that easy to do a lightning strike. China knows it can be bottled up eventually.</div>
