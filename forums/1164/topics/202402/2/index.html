            <div class='col-md body'>As usual, the Conservative US sources point finger tat China for the technologies behind Fajr-1/5<br><br><blockquote>The Smoking Missile<br><br><a href="http://www.jamestown.org/publications_details.php?volume_id=415&amp;issue_id=3837&amp;article_id=2371390" rel="nofollow">http://www.jamestown.org/publications_details.php?volume_id=415&amp;issue_id=3837&amp;article_id=2371390</a><br><br>On July 14, just two days after the conflict erupted, an Anti-Ship Cruise Missile (ASCM) launched from the coast of Lebanon hit an Israeli Hanit (Spear) SaÂ’ar 5 corvette, an anti-aircraft warfare ship that is said to be the best in its class. Not fatally damaged, the vessel managed to return to active service after a couple of weeks of repairs, but four servicemen were killed in the fire caused by the hit. A second missile hit an Egyptian merchant ship. Positively identified by its electronic signature as a Chinese-made C-802, the existence of such a missile in HezbollahÂ’s arsenal had been unknown to Israeli intelligence. Designated in China as the YJ (Yingji)-8 (or 82), around 60 to 75 (some say 125) C-802s had been delivered to Iran by 1997. Several of them subsequently found their way into Hezbollah hands. <strong>In addition, Arab sources have reported that Iran had supplied Hezbollah with Chinese-made Houdong fast-attack crafts (al-Sharq al-Awsat, July 29) as well as with Chinese-made multiple barrel rocket launchers, including the 12-tube Type 63 (also known as the Fajr-1) and the WS-1/WS-1B, which was redesigned by Iran as the Fajr-5 (Strategic Update, July).</strong></blockquote></div>
