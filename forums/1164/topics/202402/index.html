The system is part of the Fajr family of rockets.<br><br>Iran's Aerospace Industries Organization (AIO) has developed an upgraded version of the well-established Fadjr-5 333 mm (4-round) unguided surface-to-surface artillery rocket system (ARS).<br><br>The latest production of the Fadjr-5 is installed on a new Mercedes-Benz 6 x 6 forward control chassis and the platform is now integrated into a complete weapon system rather than an individual launcher. To provide a more stable firing platform four hydraulically operated stabilisers are lowered to the ground before firing.<br><br>The new chassis has improved cross-country mobility and the forward control fully enclosed cab provides space for the driver and two passengers. Another fully enclosed cabin to the immediate rear of the cab houses the remainder of the crew. The new Mercedes-Benz chassis is similar to that manufactured in China, which is used as the basis for the Norinco (China North Industries Corporation) 122 mm (40-round) Type 90 ARS.<br><br>While the primary role of this artillery rocket system is the engagement of land targets, AIO says that a radar can be added to give the system the capability to track and engage naval targets. The Fajr-5 missile, which is launched from a mobile platform, reportedly has a range of between 75 kilometers, or 50 miles.<br><br>Israeli media claimed Iran supplied a number of these rockets to Hezbollah forces in Lebanon in 2006 1.<br><br>During the 2006 Israel-Lebanon conflict it is suspected that Hezbollah militants fired Fajr-5 rockets deeper into Israel than in past conflicts. So far the strikes targetted the city of Afula yet failed to hit it. The attack attained the longest range of its kind from the lebanese border to date</blockquote></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>You have to admit.  The Hezbollah are there in Lebanon not to defend the Lebanese people from Israeli attacks.  They are using Lebanon as a launch base for the attacks, and using the Lebanese civilians as meat shields from Israeli attacks.  Hezbollah began as a resistance group to fight the Israeli invasion back in 1982.  Back then, it composed of a large spectrum of fighters, including some Christian Lebanese.  But now, it has decomposed and largely swayed by Islamic Militants.<br><br>The Hezbollah needs to be dealt with, but not by engaging them in the battlefields of Lebanon.  In order to kill Hezbollah, u need to cut their funding and support by destroying their masters in Iran and Syria. Fighting them in Lebanon would only serve them by inciting others to join their cause.<br><br>If there is anything would bring the doom of the Middle Eastern countries, its these  extremist groups.  If the Arab league does not deal with them forcefully soon, there will be greater sh!t storms than this and in greater magnitude in time to come.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>VikingS,<br><br>Yes, yes .. Both Hadera and Afula, which are further than Haifa, were hit by two Fajr-3/5. From the pic of the rocket debris ..

But Hez do not have many Fajr-3 and launching those many 5m long rockets are a death wish. They can be spotted by the naked eyes.<br><br>However, they have plenty of home made Kat Rockets .. but they do not have the range.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Sometimes i feel the Hezbollah WANTS to be spotted launching those rockets.  Whenever Israeli jets bombs them, they unavoidably happen to hit those children the Hezbollah surround their rockets with.<br><br>Its a dirty game.  Eventually, it may not be the rockets that do the most damage to the Israeli campaign, but the Israeli retaliatory actions.  Hezbolla knows that and plays that card well.</div>
