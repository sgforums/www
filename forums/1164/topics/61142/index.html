            <div class='col-md body'><span style="color: red;">Mystery behind Aug. 28 incident puzzles Army officials<br><br>By John Roos<br>Special to the Times<br><br>Shortly before dawn on Aug. 28, an M1A1 Abrams tank on routine patrol in Baghdad Â“was hit by somethingÂ” that crippled the 69-ton behemoth.<br>Army officials still are puzzling over what that Â“somethingÂ” was.<br><br>According to an unclassified Army report, the mystery projectile punched through the vehicleÂ’s skirt and drilled a pencil-sized hole through the hull. The hole was so small that Â“my little finger will not go into it,Â” the reportÂ’s author noted.<br><br>The Â“somethingÂ” continued into the crew compartment, where it passed through the gunnerÂ’s seatback, grazed the kidney area of the gunnerÂ’s flak jacket and finally came to rest after boring a hole 1Â½ to 2 inches deep in the hull on the far side of the tank.<br><br>As it passed through the interior, it hit enough critical components to knock the tank out of action. That made the tank one of only two Abrams disabled by enemy fire during the Iraq war and one of only a handful of Â“mobility killsÂ” since they first rumbled onto the scene 20 years ago. The other Abrams knocked out this year in Iraq was hit by an RPG-7, a rocket-propelled grenade.<br><br>Experts believe whatever it is that knocked out the tank in August was not an RPG-7 but most likely something new Â— and that worries tank drivers.</span><br><br>To read more...click on the following link...<br><br>http://www.armytimes.com/print.php?f=1-292236-2336437.php<br><br></div>

It's not unusual for new weapons to have unpredictable effects once they are first used in combat. Moreover, the thinner side and rear armor of the M-1 is known to be vulnerable to many portable anti-tank weapons. But until the army releases more information, if they have any, the mystery lingers. </blockquote>interesting..<br></div>
