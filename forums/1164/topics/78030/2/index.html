The 1st Hannibal.....he totally owned the Roman armies...had great tactics that was way ahead of his time....especially at Cannae where he won an army 3 times his size.<br>Trajan....Took over germany and extended the Roman borders to the river Dunnbe.A great leader and Emperor.Sadly that did not last after his death....<br><br>Middle ages(dark ages till the fall of the east roman empire)<br>wanted to choose Belisarius but then again the great Mongolian Changis Khan wins all hands down.Some would argue Subotai but nah...ill give credit that Changis Khan was the best.Took over half Half of Europe....Russia.....some of China....need i say more&gt;?<br><br>Age of Gunpowder(1450 to 1600)<br>I have no bloody idea<br><br>Period 1600-1810<br>Napoleon for the most parts....took over all of Europe save for Britian and Russia.Was he not the best?Well he might have been best by the Duke but he was unmatched in his time.<br><br>period 1810-1900<br>My gosh tough time to pick so i shall refrain.Maybe the Japan Admiral that kicked the Russian navy's ass.<br><br>Period 1900-1930<br>Ahhh.....a certain Ludendorff....won the Russian front....<br><br>Period 1930-1945<br>Well we are spoilt for bloody choice here....but i guess it would be<br>the founder of the German panzer truppen......Heinz Guderian.<br>Made the Panzer force what it was....formed the 1st panzer groups...and was involved in most of the tanks designed during that period.He also lead from the front...infact he lead from a tank some times....it was once said.....there was not tank in the German army that he could not and had not drive so yea  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Sir John de Hawkwood was english, but he was mainly fighting in Italy, under the Florentine banner, as a mercenary. Won a great many battles, often when outnumbered.<br><br>I also feel that the Black Prince who fought at Crecy was a leader, in that he inspired his men and struck fear into the hearts of his enemies... a very good early example of psychological warfare. By the way, Sir John de Hawkwood served under the Black Prince in Crecy, and it was there that he was knighted.</div>

Without him, Liu Bang would not have defeated Xiang Yu and established the Western Han Dynasty. They story told that he has not failed to conquer any cities he has attacked. Too bad that he had to die in the end cos he lacked the political acumen to survive. In terms of being a military commander, i would consider him to be the best.<br><br>Another one that came to my mind was Nian Geng Yao. He was the general that served under Yong Zheng during the QIng Dynasty. His battles if i m not wrong are against Tibet, the far reaches of the Qing Empire at that time. Again i think he was forced to commit suicide at the end.. or murdered..<br><br>Other military commanders are perhaps people like Yue Fei and other Chinese generals that have held their ground during the Southern Song Dynasty agains barbarian attackers from Liao, Jin and the Mongolians..</div>
