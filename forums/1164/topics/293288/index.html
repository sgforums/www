            <div class='col-md body'>I was in Hainan Island awhile back. Wanted to go diving and the Hainan Island guide recommended me to go to an island about 45minutes away from Sanya and the only way to the Island was via a PLN facility. I was worried : ) but the guide told me he has connections. I agreed and I was brought to a supposedly high security Naval base.<br><br>Firstly, I was amazed that the Security was very lax, I thought I will be stopped being a Foreigner, but the PL Navy MPs let me thru into the base together with some Locals ( Hainanese ) going to the same remote Island. The PLN MPs avoided me totally, I think  because of communication problems and they didn't know how to react to having a foreigner around.<br><br>On my way to the ferry jetty inside the Naval base, I pass by alot of PLN personnels, who was in sloppy military attires and sailor outfits, very ragged and most in sandals. The ships ( mostly Patrol Boats and riverine boats ) berthed have clothes being dried on clothes-line onboard.<br><br>The most surprising part was, I realised It was also a major submarine base. they have huge submarine pens built into hills and some have rusting looking submarines in it. The guide informed me the Subs' pen were built by the Japanese during wartime and is being used by PLN since then.<br><br>What I saw at the huge Naval base was utter mess. Rusting boats and subs, dilipated buildings, Ill disciplined, badly attired military personnels and ragged sailors. This was supposed to be a major active Naval base for the PLN for the South China Seas and Sea of Japan sea lanes.<br><br>I conclude, China has a long way to go to match the Americans or the Rest of East Asia for a Blue water Navy. They can't fight a war in the current derelict state I saw in Yalong Bay. China Acquiring New Ships is one thing, but maintaining them and keeping discipline, morale high troops is another when they are based a long way from the Chinese mainland</div>
