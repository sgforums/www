Permanent Secretary (Defence) Mr Peter Ho officiated at the ceremony.<br><br>Under a contract signed with Direction des Constructions Navales (DCN) in March 2000, the shipyard will be delivering six modern frigates to the RSN. These ships are intended to replace the six ageing Missile Gunboats (MGB) that have been in service for more than 25 years. The first of the class is to be built in France while the remaining five ships will be constructed locally by Singapore Technologies Marine. The Defence Science &amp; Technology Agency (DSTA) is the overall programme manager and is also undertaking to integrate the combat systems and platform in this challenging programme. The first ship is expected to sail back to Singapore in 2005.<br><br>The frigates are built to be stealthy, using the latest ship design and building technology. The addition of the frigates to the RSN Fleet will expand the capabilities that the navy can employ in the defence of Singapore.<br><br>The keel laying ceremony marks another milestone in the strong bilateral defence ties between France and Singapore. The defence relationship between Singapore and France is an extensive one which includes regular dialogue at the policy level, professional interactions in bilateral and multilateral exercises, and defence technology collaboration.<br><br>Ship Data<br><br>Length : 110 m<br><br>Breadth : 16m<br><br>Tonnage : 3200 tons<br><br>Speed : more than 25 knots<br><br>Range : 4000nm<br><br>Heli Deck : Medium size helicopter<br></blockquote><a href="http://mindef.miw.com.sg/display.asp?number=1665" rel="nofollow">http://mindef.miw.com.sg/display.asp?number=1665 </a></div>

However, it will never be big enough to be consider armanda. Though sophisticated, RSN will never be able to be grow too big, eg. no destroyers. Ships and subs are expensive.
