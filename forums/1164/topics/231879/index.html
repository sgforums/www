            <div class='col-md body'>Late last year, I finally broke down and bought a Beretta 92FS handgun to add to my collection. I did not really need one, but <a href="http://www.cdnninvestments.com" rel="nofollow">CDNN Investments</a> in Texas was closing them out at a ridiculously steep discount (over $200 less than what they generally go for retail) and I jumped at the opportunity!<br><br>Out of the box, the gun shot fine, but the sights were a wee bit off (the point of impact being about 4" left of the point of aim at 25 yards). A little 'quality time' with a sight adjustment tool fixed that. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br><br>I did a photo shoot of the 92FS yesterday for a firearms-related webzine, and thought I would share some of the pictures here:<br><br><a href="http://i57.photobucket.com/albums/g236/screwthepap2/Beretta_92FS_01_Small.jpg" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i57.photobucket.com/albums/g236/screwthepap2/th_Beretta_92FS_01_Small.jpg"></a><br><br><a href="http://i57.photobucket.com/albums/g236/screwthepap2/Beretta_92FS_02_Small.jpg" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i57.photobucket.com/albums/g236/screwthepap2/th_Beretta_92FS_02_Small.jpg"></a><br><br><a href="http://i57.photobucket.com/albums/g236/screwthepap2/Beretta_92FS_03_Small.jpg" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i57.photobucket.com/albums/g236/screwthepap2/th_Beretta_92FS_03_Small.jpg"></a><br><br><a href="http://i57.photobucket.com/albums/g236/screwthepap2/Beretta_92FS_04_Small.jpg" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i57.photobucket.com/albums/g236/screwthepap2/th_Beretta_92FS_04_Small.jpg"></a><br><br>The 92FS is currently the standard issue sidearm of the US Army, where it is designated the M9.<br><br><a href="http://www.fas.org/man/dod-101/sys/land/m-9-dvic524.jpg" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://www.fas.org/man/dod-101/sys/land/m-9-dvic524-s.jpg"></a></div>

His FNP is box-stock and <span style="font-style: italic;">it has one of the best SA triggers I have ever come across in a DA/SA handgun.</span> He was over at my house last year, and we measured the SA trigger break at just a hair under 3 lbs.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_eek.gif" alt="Shocked" title="Shocked">  FN must have some pretty good lawyers working for them! <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"> Plus, his FNP was incredibly accurate--I was managing offhand sub-3" groups at 25 yards using commercial 9mm ammo; I expect the 40S&amp;W version will be just as accurate.<br><br>(CDNN is selling the two-tone versions of both the FNP-9 and FNP-40 for just $409. That's a damn good deal!)<br><br>I don't think you'll regret getting the XD-40 Tactical. I've had one since July of 2002, and its accuracy is easily on par with that of the CZ pistols. I've thus far shot well over 25,000 rounds of my handloads through it, and it has <span style="font-style: italic;">never, ever</span> jammed or misfed. The SA trigger pull weight can be reduced with the simple replacement of the sear tension spring (I have mine down to around 2.8 lbs.), but reducing the trigger reset will require some metalwork on the trigger mechanism.<br><br>Here's a picture my XD-40, taken at around 20,000 rounds. Still looks mint, doesn't it? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br><br><a href="http://i57.photobucket.com/albums/g236/screwthepap2/XD-40_Tactical_20060806_03.jpg" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i57.photobucket.com/albums/g236/screwthepap2/th_XD-40_Tactical_20060806_03.jpg"></a><br><br>The 92FS pictured in the opening post is box stock; the differences in the appearance of the finish are probably due to variations in the lighting conditions.<br><br>By the way, have you sent you P-01 in for trigger work yet?<br><br>MG</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Man and their toys! I started collecting guns when I 1st came to the US back in 1989! back than guns were cheap! STarted with a S&amp;W Model 39 9mm pistol followed by a CHinese Type 56 SKS for $39.95. As the saying goes we just need ONE MORE gun! and I don;t look back after that...<br><br>Guns is a good investment over here in the US!  the amount of Galil, AUG and assualt weapon I have collected .. all of them double to triple in my investments ! better than some stocks I have.<br><br>HI Meia<br><br>Anyway! thanks for the info on the FNP-40! I never thought they had such good triggers  !defintely need to take a loook at it!... and the acrruacy you said is phenominal for a factory made pistols!  I ahve not sent my P01 yet becasue i have spend too much again buying the piston upper M4 and I also bought me a few of those military surplus CZ-82 in 9x18 makarov! very good buy for now! I paid like $219 each and they are like new and come with holster, 2 12 rounds mags .  shoot in a parculiar manner.<br><br>thats a nice XD40! do you like the tactical or the std 4" ones??<br><br>Hmm! i heard things about the finish of those black XD 40 that came off easily after wearing it holster! IS it better to buy the one that is stainless???<br><br>If you happen to come down to Dallas !give me a shout ! would be glad to bring you around here!<br><br>DaveC!</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Dave,<br><br>The XD's have historically had a <strong>very</strong> crappy finish on them. You could rub the finish off with just your fingers! When my XD-40 Tactical was delivered in July of 2002, parts of the finish had worn down to bare metal from just moving around in the plastic pistol case. I called Springfield about it and they refinished the slide under warranty.<br><br>Springfield finally responded to all the complaints about the finish when they introduced the XD-45ACP early last year. The XD-45ACP featured a very durable finish (called Melonite) on the slide, and Springfield adopted the same finish on the rest of their XD pistols manuactured from that point on. If you get an XD, make sure it was manufactured in 2006 or later. Alternatively, you could get one with a stainless slide (which, in my opinion, looks a lot sharper!).<br><br>If you do decide to send your P-01 to CZ-USA for trigger work, let me know and I'll talk to my contacts there to see if they can give your job a higher priority.</div>

I will have to check on the mfg date!  thanks for the tip! YEah! i hear a lot of complaints on the finish of the XD! So! I guess at least they address the problem! I will get me a new one ... Actually saw a USED XD 9mm tactical in the gunshow last weekend with 3 mags and all the holster for $399!  I guess its worth to pay and get me the new ones! I think the new one is price at $469 in the gunshow! both the XD9 tactical and the XD40 Tactical.<br><br>DaveC!</div>

ANything helps! so far only got me 4 of those Meggar 14 rd mags for the P01 from CDNN! boy were they tight fit to the gun! may have to sand them down a little to have a drop free action.  do you have that problems??<br><br>DaveC!</div></blockquote>Dave,<br><br>CZ pistols come from the factory with the magazine brake (#24 in the parts diagram of the manual) at the back of the magwell bent to press against and retain the magazine, preventing it from dropping free when the mag release is pressed.<br><br>It's real easy to make the mags drop free: just remove the two bends in the magazine brake to straighten and prevent it from applying pressure to the rear of the magazine. You need to remove the brake from the gun to accomplish this:<br><br>1. Make sure the gun is unloaded.<br><br>2. Remove the grip panels.<br><br>3. Dec<span style="font-style: italic;"></span>ock the hammer all the way forward (not just to the half-c<span style="font-style: italic;"></span>ock 'safety' position).<br><br>4. Drive out the magazine brake pin (#25).<br><br>5. While applying upward pressure on the main spring plug (#22), push out the main spring plug pin (#23).<br><br>6. Push <span style="font-style: italic;">and hold</span> the main spring plug further up (this will require considerable effort as you're pushing against the main spring [#21]).<br><br>7. Remove the magazine brake by pulling it up and forward into the magwell.<br><br>8. Gradually release pressure on the main spring plug. The plug and main spring will fall out.<br><br>You can now straighten the two bends in the brake, then reinstall it by reversing the steps above. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"><br><br></div>

The longer sight radius probably makes shooting them accurately a tad easier too.<br><br>Another nice thing about the Tacticals: they have uncaptured recoil guide rods and utilize standard full-size 1911 recoil springs, making it easy to fine-tune the recoil characteristics by using springs of different strengths. The XD-40 Tactical comes from the factory with an 18 lb. recoil spring, but I find it functions better with a 24 lb. spring (which is what I currently have in mine).</div>
