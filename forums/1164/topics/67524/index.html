Recently, a test pilot for this state-of-the art jet was in town and he told Channel NewsAsia why he thought the Eurofighter might win the dogfight for the more than US$1 billion contract.<br><br>Craig Penrice has more than 4,500 hours of flying experience in over 40 different types of aircraft.<br><br>Among them the American Boeing F-15 and the Eurofighter Typhoon, which are currently going head-to-head in a dogfight with the French Rafale to replace Singapore's Skyhawks.<br><br>But Mr Penrice, who is now testing the Typhoon, considers it the better of the two and the jewel in the crown is its cockpit.<br><br>"Things like being able to command the plane through voice control. I can do many tasks by simply talking to the plane. In my helmet, I have tactical information so wherever I'm looking, I don't have to look at the displays in the cockpit. Wherever I'm looking behind, outside I still have information available to me, this head-up-head-out looking out the plane is vitally important," he said.<br><br>BAE Systems which builds the Typhoon has been eyeing the Singapore contract for more than 4 years now.<br><br>Buying a new generation fighter jet is not a simple task.<br><br>It's much more complex than buying a new car for example. The technical details are so sophisticated and complex, BAE Systems specialists get questioned by MINDEF officials on technical issues a few times a day.<br><br>This is why Mr Penrice was in town recently to give the Defence Ministry his perspective as a Typhoon test pilot.<br><br>"Because we know what it is that the service pilot needs out of his airplane. Engineers appreciate that knowledge and they do listen to us. But with all the best intention something doesn't quite work as envisaged, we report on that and we discuss it and we come up with a plan to improve it," added Mr Penrice.<br><br>BAE Systems' Typhoon Export Programme Director, Andy Wilson, said: "The next phase we'll have to put formal information in front of the authorities here in terms of the specifications and costing data. All of that will be evaluated and assessed by the Singappore government before making their preferred choice."<br><br>Singaporeans may get a glimpse of the Eurofighter Typhoon next month at Asian Aerospace.<br><br>But the Defence Ministry is not expected to make its final choice till 2005. - CNA<br></div>

For one, a joint development of the Rafale's on-board radar - the advanced RBE-2 radar, is expected. This was reinforced by Marc Perrin de Brichambaut, the French Defence Ministry strategic affairs director, "It's true that if you get involved in the Rafale, the development of the new radar is to be done jointly."<br><br>Another plus factor for choosing the multi-role French fighter craft would grant "air space scarce" Singapore greater access to air force training areas in France.<br><br>Currently, MINDEF has short listed 3 fighter crafts from 3 respective contenders - F15T Strike Eagle from Boeing; Rafale from Dassault Aviation and Euro Typhoon from a consortium of European aircraft companies, in supplying sophisticated warplanes for the Republic's Air Force. If MINDEF does go with the Rafale deal, this will supplement its previous order of 6 stealth frigates from France's Direction des Constructions Navales International (DCN). The 110m-long frigates are being built both in France and in Singapore. They are expected to be commissioned here in Singapore in 2005.<br><br>The stealth warship is built with maximum security and firepower under its hood. It will be armed with guns, anti-aircraft and anti-ship missiles, making it self-contained. To add to its already "invincible" status, each frigate will have a naval helicopter on board for search and destroy missions of enemy submarines. According to Mr de Brichambaut, the frigates are equipped with the best equipment, "...you (Singapore) have tended to choose the best equipment on these frigates. Most of that equipment has not been integrated before on a project of this scale."<br><br>A spin-off from this defence arrangement is France benefiting from Singapore geo-political knowledge of the region. Singapore's awareness of regional developments in a broader context will as a consequence aid France it its counter-terrorism planning. - Patrick, G.</div>

For an aircraft that has been in development so long, it is nothing short of surprising, to say the least, that it is still not cleared for long flights. If you want to use yardsticks of its competitors, Rafale C flew in 1991 yet it managed to make its first flight here in 1996 (actually it was the Rafale B that came then, and it's first flight was in 1993). DA1 made its first flight in 1994, has 7 test aircraft and yet its test program has not achieved the milestones of its rival. Of course its simplistic to use this head-to-head consortium, and I'm not using it to knock the Typhoon, but my point, like it always has been, is that the delays and other political issues affecting the consortium and aircraft make it a very risky choice to make.<br><br>As for the part of FAA, CAA etc etc, thats not what I'm talking about. The fact is that he aircraft is <strong>not cleared by the consortium</strong> for long flights. Not the authorities, it is the companies who are developing the aircraft who have not cleared their own product for long flights. And that, is the official word. Not some rumour.<br><br>The key question is (as I've mentioned before): <span style="font-style: italic;"><strong>Can our fighter program wait for the consortium to get it's act together?</strong></span><br><br>Its nothing about letting the brass take joyrides, they prefer junkets to Europe for those anyway. My argument has been rebutted out of context, but I'll admit, in my initial post, I made it easy to do so.<br><br><strong><br><span style="font-style: italic;">2) Has a test program that has delayed again and again </span><br>rafale A flew 1st 4 july 1986, rafale C 1991, wow no delays huh<br></strong><br><br>See above<br><br><strong><span style="font-style: italic;">3) suffered so many cost overruns it scandalous</span><br>rafale dun have meh? well maybe french have better accountants </strong><br><br>Again, they pale in comparison to the Eurofighter's. And the development schedule of the Rafale (and obviously the F-15), as I've stated before, is more suited to our entry-into-service requirements than the Typhoon.

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by wombat:</div><div class="quote_body"><a href="http://content.miw.com.sg/LifeStyle/MiwNews/ls_miwnews02_20031103.asp" rel="nofollow">Source : MIW Website </a><br><br>Article dated 3rd November 2003<br><br>Singapore assured of French support in warplane deal<br><br>Singapore gets French government support in joint on-board radar development and greater access to training areas in France if Rafale is chosen over two other aircraft...<br><br>Should Singapore go with the French aviation giant, Dassault Aviation, in opting for Rafale as the warplane to replace the SAF's aging A-4 Super Skyhawks, greater collaboration is expected in the pipeline. For one, a joint development of the Rafale's on-board radar - the advanced RBE-2 radar, is expected. This was reinforced by Marc Perrin de Brichambaut, the French Defence Ministry strategic affairs director, "It's true that if you get involved in the Rafale, the development of the new radar is to be done jointly."<br><br>Another plus factor for choosing the multi-role French fighter craft would grant "air space scarce" Singapore greater access to air force training areas in France.<br><br>Currently, MINDEF has short listed 3 fighter crafts from 3 respective contenders - F15T Strike Eagle from Boeing; Rafale from Dassault Aviation and Euro Typhoon from a consortium of European aircraft companies, in supplying sophisticated warplanes for the Republic's Air Force. If MINDEF does go with the Rafale deal, this will supplement its previous order of 6 stealth frigates from France's Direction des Constructions Navales International (DCN). The 110m-long frigates are being built both in France and in Singapore. They are expected to be commissioned here in Singapore in 2005.<br><br>The stealth warship is built with maximum security and firepower under its hood. It will be armed with guns, anti-aircraft and anti-ship missiles, making it self-contained. To add to its already "invincible" status, each frigate will have a naval helicopter on board for search and destroy missions of enemy submarines. According to Mr de Brichambaut, the frigates are equipped with the best equipment, "...you (Singapore) have tended to choose the best equipment on these frigates. Most of that equipment has not been integrated before on a project of this scale."<br><br>A spin-off from this defence arrangement is France benefiting from Singapore geo-political knowledge of the region. Singapore's awareness of regional developments in a broader context will as a consequence aid France it its counter-terrorism planning. - Patrick, G.</div></blockquote>The question is will it be economical/worth it to buy this plane? The carrot being dangled to the Mindef is the opprotunity to develop the AESA version of the Rafale's radar,  and probably plus some other technology thrown in for good measure...<br><br>But the question I would like to ask is at what price??? Are we being suckered into helping to fund the development cost for the future version (F3 standard) because the French government is reluctant or simply don't have the dough to fund this development? Will we be paying so much more for the aircraft that the cost per plane would rocket to such a level that it would be a bargain to buy either the F15E or the Typhoon. Would we truly have the technology we wanted/promised, and recupped our investments? AND What about the cost of integrating non-french weapons, who is going to pay for this???<br><br>All these questions are simply hypothetical, we don't know for sure, we don't even know whether the radar can perform as advertised...There are simply too many uncertainties when it comes to choosing this plane, is that why NO other country has opt for it???<br><br>Much as I admire the Rafale, I have much trepidation when it comes to the selection of this plane. We don't want a white elephant, DO WE???<br><br>(PS: If MINDEF is reading this thread, please get this into your head!!!)<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>The Eurofighter was as much a politically driven project as it was military.  It was an attempt by European states to exhibit solidarity and a "can-do" spirit so as to ward off the "everything comes from across the Atlantic" phenomenon that was happening during the 1980s.<br><br>The 620 planes on the launch order list are for the states whose aerospace industries are involved in it's production.  Austria and Greece are the only two European/Med countries who are not involved in Eurofighter production/techno design although the Greeks are expected to push the Hellenic Aerospace industry into the Consortium.<br><br>Because the Eurofighter is a multination project, it has its share of delays and inflated budget exceeds as well as technological compromises to meet the requirements and capabilties of member states.  Most significant of these was that it was a fighter meant for the cold war eighties that could only start flying in production status in 2001.  Many analysts point their fingers at the governments of Germany and Italy for failing to forfill their part of the contract on time in in fullness.  Already recent UK defence budget reviews spell uncertainty for the Eurofighter when the bulwark project partner's involvement in Tranche 2 and 3 are becoming more uncertain.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Export Boost<br>AW&amp;ST<br>Feb 23, 2004<br><br>Launch of key software upgrade may improve Rafale's Singapore prospects despite potential slowdown in French orders.<br><br>French plans to go ahead with an anti-ship/reconnaissance upgrade for the Dassault Rafale fighter and ensure timely air force service entry signal the government's willingness to boost the aircraft's export potential.  However, the extent of that support is unclear.<br><br>Defense procurement agency DGA reaffirmed on Feb. 2 that an audit ordered to evaluate whether existing Rafale delivery timetables can be maintained --as well as who will pay for the impact of previous stretchouts-- would have no effect on export sales.  In particular, the DGA said the review should not affect a Singapore air force competition to be decided later this year.  The Rafale has been shortlisted for the 20-aircraft purchase, along with the Boeing F-15 and Eurofighter Typhoon.<br><br>A dozen Rafales are currently in service with the French navy on the Charles De Gaulle aircraft carrier.  These have only the basic F1 software package, with a limited air-to-air engagement capability, although a second flotilla with upgraded software is to be added over the next five years.<br><br>Moreover, the DGA confirmed that a contract for development of a software upgrade designed to add a strategic strike, reconnaissance and antiship capability to the Rafale--the basis for the export version being offered to Singapore-- would be awarded by month's end.  Known as F3, the upgrade is intended specifically for the new ASMP-A missile that will equip France's nuclear fighter-bomber fleet, but it will serve conventional applications as well.<br><br>In addition, the DGA insisted that further delays to the program, which is already 10 years late, would not affect the planned dates for introducing the aircraft into service with the French air force.  This is expected to be another key element in the Singapore selection.<br><br>The first air force squadron equipped with the current F2 software--intended to improve air-to-air combat capabilities and add a surface strike dimension-- will become operational in 2006, as planned, the DGA said.  The F2 package will allow the Rafale to carry the new AASM modular standoff weapon and Scalp cruise missile, integrated with the Damocles laser designator pod.<br><br>The first F3 nuclear-armed Rafale squadron will enter service in 2008, about in line with Singapore's target for initial operational capability.  This version will be associated with a new-generation reconnaissance pod and other improvements.  On Feb. 10, the DGA issued MBDA an award to adapt the MM39 airborne version of the Exocet antiship missile to the multirole version, as part of a larger Exocet upgrade award.<br><br>Furthermore, the agency said new delays would not influence the total number of Rafales to be acquired(294), and in particular a pending buy of a new batch of multirole aircraft to supplement the 61 on order.  The government said this purchase, which had been expected in 2003, would go ahead this year, although it did not specify whether the buy would cover all 59 aircraft originally planned.  In fact, officials noted, a lower delivery rate could actually benefit the Rafale in Singapore, by freeing up production slots.<br><br>For their part, Dassault Aviation executives noted that the second issue in the audit--who is to pay for extra costs to replace obsolescent electronics stemming from past delays-- will affect only existing F1 standard aircraft, not future purchases.  Replacing these components will entail considerable redesign, testing and rejigging of production that could cost several hundred million dollars or more, they indicated.<br><br>Nevertheless, despite broad evidence of the government's good will, Dassault officials--mindful of past refusals to support export upgrades with state money-- remain unsure of the ultimate level of public commitment.  True, Singapore has been offered the possibility of using air force training facilities in Cazaux, France, and participating in development of a new RBE-2 active-phased array antenna radar for the Rafale(AW&amp;ST Nov. 10 , 2003,p.19).<br><br>But Dassault considers that a French government commitment to the RBE2, which is only at the demonstration stage, may be crucial to the outcome.  Currently, France does not plan to launch development of the radar until 2008. The RBE 2 would permit use of the new-generation Meteor beyond-visual-range weapon, to be introduced in 2012, as well as an all-weather metric-precision AASM version and future suppression of enemy air defense systems(AW&amp;ST June 23 , 2003,p.3<img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool">.<br><br>No indication was given about the number of aircraft that might be affected by the possible delivery cutback.  But the two air force squadrons would account for around 40 of the 76 aircraft to be delivered by 2008, and the naval flotilla for a dozen more.<br><br></div>

For an aircraft that has been in development so long, it is nothing short of surprising, to say the least, that it is still not cleared for long flights. If you want to use yardsticks of its competitors, Rafale C flew in 1991 yet it managed to make its first flight here in 1996 (actually it was the Rafale B that came then, and it's first flight was in 1993). DA1 made its first flight in 1994, has 7 test aircraft and yet its test program has not achieved the milestones of its rival. Of course its simplistic to use this head-to-head consortium, and I'm not using it to knock the Typhoon, but my point, like it always has been, is that the delays and other political issues affecting the consortium and aircraft make it a very risky choice to make.<br><br>As for the part of FAA, CAA etc etc, thats not what I'm talking about. The fact is that he aircraft is <strong>not cleared by the consortium</strong> for long flights. Not the authorities, it is the companies who are developing the aircraft who have not cleared their own product for long flights. And that, is the official word.
