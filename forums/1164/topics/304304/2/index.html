Usually it will be a complete Unit regardless of size.<br><br>What i meant was 300 vehicles has to quantitfy into whole unit numbers (Dont forget unit numbers will come with the support vehicles (engineer/medic/firesupport because they have to move together or even replacement vehicles), it will go beyond 1 vehicle to account for each section as the unit grows bigger.<br><br>Hence why i count as 1 brigade.  300 vehicles should be able to cover 1 NS brigade strength + vehicles for training 1 bn + spares which is very good i feel.<br><br>I just cannot figure out how the L2s are going to be sorted wait until i can go look see look see when i go reservice again. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_twisted.gif" alt="Twisted Evil" title="Twisted Evil">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_twisted.gif" alt="Twisted Evil" title="Twisted Evil"><br><br>As for the question if Wheeled IFVs can complement armoured ops, they can and will do very well.

            <div class='col-md body'>Wheel/Track arguments can discuss until the cows come home and it's still never concluded.<br><br>Wheels arent that badly hampered as you think, but they arent fantastically are mobile.  Just to clarify, where the rover can go, a wheel ifv can go. A track can go where a wheel cannot go BUT there are also many places where the track cannot go.  Terrax can go upslope 60 degrees that's comparable performance to tracks. 0.7m verticle and 2 metre gap, that's very impressive. I'm surprise myself when i saw the brochure hehe.<br><br>In armour ops, you wont pick a lousy terrain to fight unless you have to.  If you have to, then you are in trouble eitherway if you are track or not (or you send in the infantry to walk hehe).  While wheel ifvs have not been used to complement track vehicles so far, they can and are able to do so over decent terrain which are often picked for use in armour movements. Wheels will have no problem on plantations definitely.<br><br>Iraq's is sand.  Here we have mud. Which is worst?  Cant honestly say without sitting on the terrex to confirm.<br><br>As for urban ops, you dont drive your vehicle into a place where you cant move freely, whether track or not.  yes while tracks can pivot turn, urban areas have plenty of roads that are catered for lorries and buses which are far bigger than wheeled ifvs. Not to mention, unlike cars, wheeled ifvs arent restricted by the curb.  If something is in the way, they just have to go over it.<br><br>What i meant was the tactical ability for the vehicles to be approach closer without being detected.  Especially in the environment at night and there's still fighting.   Tracks on road can be heard distinctly.</div>

Cross country, it all depends.  Tracks will travel well regardless.<br><br>For Wheeled vehicles to follow behind a large force of tracks... may not be a very good idea.  The tracks tend to tear up and damage the path, making it even harder for wheeled vehicles to navigate.<br><br>How will the Terrex change the mission profile of the infantry?  They might be able to travel further on the vehicle and hump it a whole lot less.  The Terrex affords more protection than the Tonners can, and would be able to bring the men to the front without getting ambushed by partisan forces with just small arms.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I think the mechanisation of INF BN into a wheeled based mechanised IFV force like the stryker combat teams are a gd initiative.<br>The ammo tradition INF carry is limited and we do carry lesser ammos than the western military.This is bcos their troops are mechanised so they can ferry more eqp, ammos and rations. This will lead to lesser strain and burden to the troops as they are no longer travelling on foot.<br>Secondly, traditional foot soldiers are easy prey for enemy arty fire even in the vegetations. So for the IFV unless the ammo is some sort of anti armour flechettes, the chances of survival and lower casualty rates are high. Besides, if the IFV is carrying some sort of thermal imager and that the BMS is linked to UAVs, danger areas can be discovered earlier and thus be avoided.<br>Thirdly, the firepower is going to increase, as the chain cannon or the grenade laucher on it can provide additional fire support as compared to the traditional 84RR and MG</div>

              <p>I think the key word is rapid deployment.  The Yanks were said to be very impressed with our Bionix but chose Stryker over it 'cos Stryker was wheeled.  Bionix comes in a variant that can be transported by C-130 but AFAIK SAF doesn't use those.  Our's can't fit into C-130.  But the Terrex can.  Its amphibious capability will come in useful too.</p>
              <p>If Wikipedia is to be believed, Terrex is to replace V200.  And AFAIK V200 is used by ADA units only as a platform for RBS-70.  The wheeled vehicles used by Armour are the even older V150.</p>
              <p>Nevertheless, would be interesting seeing a Terrex mounted with a 105mm tank gun or multiple ATGM launchers.  After all, a previous COA did toy with the idea of a missile platform to replace the SM1s.  With Leo 2 coming into the picture, maybe such a platform could complement the Leo 2.  Speaking of ATGM, any idea why none of our IFVs have ATGM?  I believe the Stryker and Bradley are equiped with ATGMs in addition to their 20 (or was it 30?) mm gun.</p>

              <p>Bradley/Strykers are armed with 30/25 mm.</p>
              <p>Terrex -may- replace the v200s if the terrax gets approved and accepted in the SAF as a multipurpose wheel IFV.</p>
              <p>At only 10 tons worth of load, i'm not so sure if a 105 mm low-velo barrel is suitable when packaged with a good FCS. </p>
              <p>30mm/GPMG/AGL/0.5 RWS is definitely possible and IS shown as a package on the stengg pdf brochure.</p>
              <p>There's no need for us to have ATGMs complement our Bx 2s 30mm at the moment.</p>
              <p>There's a reason why you mentioned the "previous" COA Where is he now? Missile tanks are a headache - nice to have but useless. </p>
              <p>There are alot of drawbacks to missiles to be used as the main engagement armnament in armoured combat.</p>
              <p>high cost, high maintainence, huge weight, large size, electricity, limited tactical flexibility, lack of economical value, continuous tech-edge dependence are the main drawbacks to going pure missile in addition to numerous other reasons.</p>

              <p>I don't really think so, I mean it's a useful feature to have and by any measures its pretty commonplace even in normal trucks... in the end you are not going to use the same tire pressure for driving offroad then if you are moving down a smooth highway.</p>

              <p>There is really a limit how good CTIS will go and it does not auto adjust to the terrain.</p>
              <p>By softening the tyre results in a greater surface area of contact where the same force spread over a larger area reduces the ground pressure.</p>
              <p>Terrex weighs tens of tons... 8 contact areas...</p>
