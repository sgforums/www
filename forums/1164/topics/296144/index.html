            <div class='col-md body'>SG Navy future Orbat of maintaining a 6 fleet submarine force, a possible replacement for the Sjoormen Class coastal submarine.<br><br>BTW HDW has bought over Kockums.<br><br>HDW has presented a new submarine at SUBCON 2007, Type 210mod.<br><br>Design is (obviously) based on the Type 210, which is better known as the Norwegian Ula class.<br><br>Several subcomponents will be identical to or derived from Type 212A/214 hardware, others (as with Type 210) will come from the proven Type 209 line.<br><br>Some characteristics that have been laid out so far:<br><br>Dimensions: 56 m length, 1,000 tons submerged (slightly smaller than Type 210) Crew: 15 men crew in two-shift, 21 men in three-shift operation; additional bunkspace reserved<br>Endurance: 30 days target<br>Automation: only in areas where crew numbers can be reduced by it<br>Construction: Single-hull, HY80 steel; small sail (as in 212A) for signature reduction<br>Propulsion: Dieselelectric; 2x improved MTU 12V 396 diesel; Permasyn "silent" electric engine (from 212A)<br>Signature Reduction Features: X-Rudder configuration, Skew-Back propeller<br>Armament: 8x 533mm torpedo tubes (14 torpedoes); missile launch or mine capability installable on customer demand<br>Sail installations: optical periscope, telescoping communications mast, telescoping radar mast, two-man diver chamber (for SF insertion operations); additional space reserved<br>Sonar: see attached picture 5 (sensors)<br><br>HDW, with Type 210mod, says is trying to tackle "budget" markets in particular in South America and South-East Asia to be able to directly compete with the current Russian export offensive in those areas, pricewise.<br>Additionally, HDW sees the Type 210mod as a good potential "entry submarine", for navies without submarines yet. A secondary market is to sell certain navies a new budget submarine instead of costly modernization of existing subs. And the third market is as a "low-end" supplement to navies with Type 214 or Type 209/1400 (or similar) subs, as HDW will market it with interoperability and straight compatibility (including crew training) to those classes.<br><br>HDW plans this sub as a direct competitor to Amur and SMX-23.<br><br>Type 210mod apparently garnered a lot of interest at SUBCON 2007. TKMS/HDW is currently in the final design phases and expects to have the design ready for biddings in 2008.<br><br>The market analysis primarily points at China renewing their sub fleet in the next few years, which subsequently causes about everyone else in the area to upgrade too of course. HDW has identified a medium-term need for up to 80 submarines in the area.<br><br>Indonesia was pointed out (currently upgrading their two Type 209 at HDW), and, the way they're stressing the interoperability and compatibility with Type 214, they're hinting at South Korea and Pakistan at least. Indonesia would actually be a rather tough market, since they've been swinging for Kilos lately.<br><br><span style="color: blue;">Singapore might be a possible market too, especially since HDW has swallowed Kockums who sold Singapore those Sjoormen class subs in the 90s. </span>Thailand might still be in for subs too.<br><br>Taiwan would be rather difficult to get an export permission for at the moment, actually.<br><br>In South America, they're primarily pointing out Columbia or Peru, who wouldn't have money for the pricier HDW subs. But also of course Ecuador, Chile, Argentina...</div>
