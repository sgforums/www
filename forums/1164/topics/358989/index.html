              besides Luke Arizona and now Mountain Home, anywhere else state side RSAF train?
              
              F-15SGs for the RSAF "Buccaneers" arrive at MHAFB
              Wednesday, May 6, 2009
              Plans to open a new Republic of Singapore air force training squadron at Mountain Home AFB took a significant move forward Wednesday, May 6, when the first of its advanced F-15SG fighters arrived here.
              
              The aircraft, part of the 428th Fighter Squadron, known as the Buccaneers, was greeted by a costumed buccaneer waving a pirate flag.
              
              "This is a great day for Mountain Home and Mountain Home Air Force Base in welcoming our good friends from Singapore," said Mayor Rist, prior to the ceremonies.
              
              "It seemed like there were 1,000 things that had to happen. It seemed overwhelming, but all of these things are happening and this is quite a milestone in working toward standing up the squadron later this month and inaugurating the Peace Carvin V program," said Col. Jim Bird, the 366th Fighter Wing commander, in his remarks welcoming the unit to MHAFB.
              
              The Peace Carvin Process began when the tiny Republic of Singapore came to the United States to ask if they could build an aircraft and have a place to be trained.
              
              "What an auspicious and historical moment, that continues our long relationship," said Col. James McGovern 366th Ops Group Commander who opened the arrival ceremony, which featured several short speeches and a cake-cutting ceremony. The cake displayed the flags of both the United States and the Republic of Singapore.
              
              The Republic of Singapore air force, or RSAF, will eventually maintain up to 10 of the multi-role aircraft at Mountain Home as part of a long-standing partnership with the United States to train its aircrews. The unit will include approximately 180 active duty and 130 support personnel. During the life of the program, as many as 200 active duty RSAF personnel will live and work on the base.
              
              Mountain Home was selected to house the training squadron following an Air Force study that began in 2005. The base was deemed the ideal location because of its extensive range complex, excellent year-round flying conditions, existing facilities and highly trained personnel. A Letter of Agreement between the United States and Singapore calls for planes to fly out of Mountain Home for 25 years. The first two years will train the initial cadre.
              
              "What a beautiful airplane," said Col. Bird as he looked over the new planes arriving at his base. "It's absolutely incredible, I just want to crawl up the ladder and get a whiff of that new car smell.
              
              The Boeing F-15SG is an advanced version of the F-15E Strike Eagle currently flown by two squadrons at Mountain Home AFB. For the casual observer, the F-15SG is indistinguishable from a Strike Eagle except that it will be branded with the "lion head" insignia that designates it as a Singaporean asset.
              
              The Boeing Company rolled out the first F-15SG jet fighter for the RSAF on Nov. 3, 2008. The F-15SG is the world's most advanced version of the F-15 airframe and features a blend of high performance, diverse weapons loads and advanced, integrated sensors. Its avionics are actually more advanced than the F-15 Eagle and Strike Eagle aircraft flown by the 366th Wing.
              
              "For Mountain Home, it's going to be great because we get to train with an ally on a daily basis and it will be great culturally because they will be working with us as Gunfighters, being a part of our team," said Col.Bird.
              
              During a ceremony May 18, the 366th Fighter Wing, in conjunction with the RSAF, will officially activate the Buccaneer squadron at the base.
              
              "The base is very excited to work with the RSAF because this partnership provides important combat readiness training for our Singapore partners, and fulfills the need to train as a team in a multi-national force structure," said Lt. Col. Keith Gibson, the training squadron's U.S. commander.

              <p>RSAF maintains training facilities in various places in the US, Australia and France.  There is a shared live firing range in Indonesia.  I think that is no longer operational.</p>
              <p>Col Bird would love the F-15SG, especially since it has AESA, whereas his birds not yet.</p>
              <p>This should give the local economy a much welcomed boost.</p>

            <div class='col-md body'><p>Interesting question, Fatum. I no expert on planes - the sort of things country x (I presume our friend in Mideast) can go over - can they be done after leaving Boeing factory? Or can upgrade be done after leaving factory (like my car, can zzhng with aftermarket parts)?</p></div>
