            <div class='col-md body'>In this month's magazine I saw what appears to be the Corporal First Class rank on 2 NSmen from an air defence unit in no 4 uniform.<br><br>Looked damn ugly.  Basically a CPL rank with two arches on top instead of one.  Strangely, it doesn't appear on MINDEF website.<br><br>I'm guessing its one of those "unofficial" ranks just like PFC.  You wouldn't find PFC on MINDEF website but there are many of them around in the army.  Don't know about other formations but I'm from Engineers &amp; there are many PFCs around &amp; I don't just mean super old NSmen.  And no, its not that they forgot to replace their old LCP rank.  Have seen the name list &amp; PFC does keep appearing.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>got discuss here be4 i believe.<br>example some units like techies, they go through special course, they can do the job of a sergeant but its service work, so last time they get promoted frm cpl to 3sg to reflect such a job. but they dont go through sispec de. so they prolly come up with such a rank so that 3sg is strictly for those sispec trained and for those cpl who got go for extra course and get extra duties can get cfc to reflect their new job</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>another reason why CFC was introduced ( btw i don't really like the acronym) was to promote deserving corporals who have done well, or to acknowledge the CPLs who may from time to time take on specialist roles.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>When I was a NSF 10 years ago, it was quite ridiculous.  Dunno about other units but in my unit, anyone who had A-levels or diploma automatically got sent for upgrading course.  So regardless of whether they were clerk, storeman or mechanic, all ended up ORDing as 3SG.<br><br>As a result there were TONS of 3SG.  In fact when I go back for ICT now, that problem becomes even more evident.  Just throw a stone &amp; chances are the head it hits will be that of a 3SG.  Basically every tom, dick or harry is a 3SG.  My entire tech squad is made up of 3SG save for 2 men which is hilarious in a way.<br><br>I'm supposing this same problem occurred SAF wide which is why now they decide to cap the rank at CPL, save for those outstanding ones who get CFC.</div>

I personally felt that many of the ppl in my unit deserved to be promoted beyond the rank of LCP rather than those so called better brains who throughly screwed up many a time.<br><br>In fact, there used to be 2 LCPs in my side who were assigned to S3 branch. Even though one of the LCPs was newly posted in he was slated for upgrade to 3SG (double jump in rank simply cos he was an A lvl student) but his attitude left much to be deserved. I think he was probably gloating over the fact that he can arrow ppl to do chores and sai kang for him in a month's time. I went to my unit S1 directly along with my DY S3 and managed to "persuade" him to promote the other deserving LCP instead. Imagine the look on the both their faces when we announced the promotion. One of disappointment (heh heh) and the other of surprise.</div>

So it is not realistic to segregate and adopt a system of selective promotion based on duties that are not fixed per se.<br><br>We don't operate in rigid structures, and very often, people are expected to cover for a few roles at a time. This is more evident at depot level and above.<br><br>As for blur kings and sotongs, perhaps the SAF should increase the difficulty level at the vocational coursework level, to weed out those that will not make the grade to even be a competent technical specialist, nevermind the probable "blurness".<br><br>If I had guys under me who are blur kings in appearance, but who can give me great assistance in doing paperwork, contracts and all that, I'd still take the chap.<br><br>Like I said, different orbits, different atmosphere.</div>
