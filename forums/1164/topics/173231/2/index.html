            <div class='col-md body'>Well,this is my way of looking at things, you know hw Boeing always emphasises of the Apache's LongBow Radar system which allows it to pop up over terrain, lock on to targets,compute a fire solution,assign them to others in the attack group, den pop up again, before unleashing the Hellfires on the, and ducking away.Once missile strike, pop up to confirm kill. I doubt that Apache pilots are trained to actually fire on the move as a form of tactics. Thus, if you are constantly popping up and down, firstly, your position can be narrowed down.once you pop up again, naturally, I will lob everything from HMGs,RPGs, Mobile SAMs, Small Arms Fire, spitballs, paperclips and rubberbands, etc....in your location. When faced with a wall of projectiles, chances are there some will hit.<br><br>However in the case of the A-10, I belief that their ability to swoop in fast, and maintain a low speed, and fire away Mavericks of the IR or TV Guided variety and its GAU-8 7 barrel 30mm gun which fires depleted-uranium ammunition which are able to penetrate bodies of tanks,thats a whole lot of difference between moving and shooting, and being stationary and shooting. We all know how hard to hit a moving target right?So precisely the point, I believe the Apache is a competent weapons platform, but the doctrine regulating its fighting style should be changed.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>maintenance wise, i would prefer they took the money to buy another super puma whenever we have a major servicing.  Rather than waste time stripping, checking and fitting the whole thing back again.  But buying a whole new aircraft is just not ideal would it?<br><br>What we can do however is modify the aircraft to suit OUR needs.  And that is one of the criteria that Singapore always looks for when purchasing an aircraft, is it upgradable?<br><br>So instead of saying, we should have bought this or that, maybe you guys can look into why Singapore didn't buy this or that if it was such a good buy in your eyes?  If you can list down the reasons, you will truly understand why the military/government purchased that equipment.</div>
