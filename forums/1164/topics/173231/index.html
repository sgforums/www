            <div class='col-md body'>Assuming Singapore could not or did not want to get the Apache chopper from America, would it be a good/wise move to purchase the Mi-24 Hind Helicopter from the Russians? (Assuming all the helicopters would be delivered in immaculate condition and there would be no problem in training pilots and spare parts supply and maintenance. Assuming Russia would allow SAF to use its training grounds for training uses also.)<br><br>For those who might not know what the Mi-24 Hind Helicopter is, it is the huge Russian helicopter that appeared in both the Rambo 2 and Rambo 3 movies and in the movie was flown by the Russians to try to destroy Rambo and also the Afghan resistance fighters in Rambo 3.<br><br>If I am correct, it is the worlds fastest and largest attack helicopter and carries a formidable assortment of rockets, missiles and guns.<br><br>For those who know the Apahce and/or the Mi-24 Hind very well, which one would be the better overall? I do not know much about both choppers but know that the Apache has very strong armour and night vision. Does the Mi-24 Hind have these features too and so are they as good as or even better than the Apache?<br><br>One advantage the Mi-24 Hind would have over the Apache is probably faster speed.<br><br>For those who are knowledgable please comment.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Yeah, loved the Hind. armoured, fast, heavily armed and can carry a basic squad. But quality wise, not that great... as usual short engine life. The East German's Hind were said to vibrate like hell when pushed, so the speed wise not as advertised. But it's true that it required less maintanience between missions than the Apache.<br><br>On another note, If licence to China.. well I do see a potential in Singapore. China does built those russian stuff with better quality, then upgrade them with ST avionics and counter measures.

            <div class='col-md body'>The Apache is initially designed to be a dedicated tank killer to attack the Soviet tank columns that never came during the Cold War. While the Hind is build like a flying tank/APC. It is heavily armoured and can fire quite a range of weapons. It also have the capability to carry infantrymen. You can also see this in the newer Merkeva where a MBT is used to ferry a small number of troops, just that the Hind flies as well. Being a jack of all trades have its price,it lack agility in flight due to its weight.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"></div>

There was speculation during the Cold War of the possible scenario of a helo dogfight between the American Apache and the then-Soviet Hind-D. The Apache will of cos' emerge the winner in most of the scenarios. I think the Hokum would be a better match...<br><br>Even if we use the Hind for COIN, it can still be bushwhacked easily. Mudjahideens would regularly bait the Hind to fly in-between valleys where they would fire steel cables at the rotors, fire lotsa RPGs from the top-down, or a combination of both and a variety of other techniques. In the S.E. Asian scenario, guerillas can string explosives at potential LZs when the Hind comes to insert troops, or hide in spider holes with Iglas or any other portable SAMs, RPGs or just plain LAWs..wait until it passes over and away from you and then take a tail-end shot... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br><br>The Apache can do an inverted roll, as can the Little Bird. The Hind-D will just fall flat upside-down like a grand piano dropped from a height, with its legs standing up.. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br><br>My 0.02 cents... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>is anyone even considering politics as a major decision maker?<br><br>if not, i'll ask this.  Anyone considered maintenance costs too? Or the ability of the aircraft to upgrade their avionics systems?  Will the location of Singapore affect the lifespan of the chopper?  Are the parts cheap?  Can it take a certain grade of fuel only available on ships IF it has to engage in shipborne activities?  How often do the parts have to be changed?  Are the engines upgradable?  Is it compatible with the engine oil we have now? There are many other questions...</div>
