            <div class='col-md body'>Light tank is for recon. It has less armour n firepower than mbt but it has greater speed n mobility. Being smaller n lighter, it can get into places that larger tanks cannot,is less easy to detect n is much faster.  It's role is to detect the enemy.It wants to avoid a fight if possible.It's lighter armaments allow it to fire a few rounds so as to disengage quickly,should the enemy see it n start shooting.<br><br>In our case, maybe include some fire support,take out some light vehicles,MG nests but not fight MBTs....We leave that to ATGM, no longer tank vs tank cos ATGM can now kill MBTs n easier n cheaper too. About $5000 vs $1500000+.... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"> Our ATGM have greater chance of killing the MBT than SM1.....But we should include "flame weapons" (aircraft n artillery n mortar) n cluster n smart ammos for artillery n mortar to improve our odds....Can use "flame weapons" to attack armour as well<br></div>

Plus the fact that Jane's already states we have it.  Anyway, now that our neighbour has MBTs as well, it not really much of a big deal.

Its not as if we have cruise missiles, aircraft carriers or B2  stealth bombers.<br><br>Besides, its each country's right to buy whatever they see fit.  When the M'sians announced plans to buy subs, MBTs, Sukhois, attack choppers, etc did we make noise?  On the other hand, each time we buy a toy, the M'sians will start questioning the need for it.  If M'sia doesn't need to ask S'pore for permission before they go shopping &amp; they can buy anything they want, I don't see why we need to ask them for permission or worry about what they think.  After all, like I said, its not as if we are buying nukes or the like.<br><br>As for MBTs being "offensive".

Kinda like an arrow.<br><br>SLAP:  Special Load Armor Piercing??  .50 cal round capable of penetrating lightly armored vehicles.<br><br>Usefulnes:  All of the above kills vehicles with prejudice.  All kinetic based weapon. (Except STAFF)  Longer the distance, less penetration.<br><br>HEAT rounds, or rounds that use explosively form penetrators, retain their penetration ability over whatever distances.  However, they are also slower projectiles compared to the Kinetic munitions.</div>

SM1 and the Ultra M113 are good examples so if can carry things outside then will put them outside.<br><br>There are examples in past wars where crews will attach extra tracks to the exterior of their vehicles for added protectection.</div>
