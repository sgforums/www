            <div class='col-md body'>This is with reference to the recent news article on SAF providing more protection for the canvas covered 5 ton trucks.  The level of protection is supposedly for low intensity conflicts.   From the picture in the Straits Times article, it appears to have armour plates attached to the sides the trucks.<br><br>The low intensity conflicts that SAF is thinking about must be against an opposition armed with sticks and stones.  That is the only way the troops in that armoured truck will ever hope to survive.<br><br>If the truck were to encounter an Improvised Explosive Device (IED), the consequences will not be good.  Generally an IED blast is not focused and vented upwards.  In the case of the armoured truck, the armoured side walls and the wooden plank floor will channel force upwards through where the troops are.  The armour plates now become a liability instead of protection.  If that is not lethal enough, the two spare tyres carried below the truck bed will come crashing through like a battering ram.<br><br>Now in the case of the pressure plate landmine, with the truck traveling forward, the explosive force will direct the front tire/s, axle and other related automotive parts upwards.  All this shrapnel will go into the front cabin with relative ease.<br><br>The firing ports are usually overrated and a grenade hazard. A system like a remotely operated machine gun will be safer eg CROWS. Last but not the least it needs an additional skirt made of fencing material to trigger the fuzes of rocket propelled grenades.<br><br>In my opinion, if Singapore Technologies can design a armoured personnel carrier like the Bionix, it should not be a stretch to design a vehicle with more protection.  After all the principles of these vehicles are fairly simple.  No load above the wheels, smooth and Vshaped hull for the bottom of the truck and the use civilian automotive transmission<br></div>
