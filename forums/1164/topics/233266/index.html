A regular visitor to Thailand and Southeast Asia, he has strong links with the Thai military...</a></strong><br><br>(<strong>Aussie</strong>)<br>Prof Ball said Australia went through a similar debate five years ago when Singtel purchased the Optus mobile phone company. He was one of a series of analysts who publicly opposed the takeover. The Australian government eventually allowed the sale to go through, partly to ensure continued close cooperation with the island state, but Australia had to spend a huge sum on fibre-optic cables to avoid use of the Optus satellite and ensure its defence communications were secure.<br><br>Part of the problem, Ball said, was "Singapore have a track record of taking advantage of information for commercial and political purposes" - as did the US, and former Soviet Union.<br><br>Singapore had "listened to and photographed Australian military facilities", which had created diplomatic rifts, he said.<br><br>"They have a history of abusing their access to training in other facilities abroad.<br><br>"That is not what friends are supposed to do - they abused their friendship," Ball said......<br><br>(<strong>Thailand</strong>)<br>Singapore already had an extensive array of satellite listening facilities, from a major base on Sentosa Island to listening equipment at the Thai Army base in Sai Yok - which Prof Ball said appeared to be "primarily focused on Thailand" - judging by the types of antennae he had seen there in recent years.<br><br>There were both HF (High Frequency) and VHF (Very High Frequency) antennae at the Singaporean compound at RTA base in Sai Yok, but he believed "the VHF is predominantly listening to Thailand" within a radius of 100-150km. A priority target might be a military base such as the Ninth Division and its associated units at Kanchanaburi.</blockquote>---http://www.nationmultimedia.com/2007/01/23/headlines/headlines_30024843.php<br><br><strong><a href="http://www.fas.org/irp/facility/Chapter3.htm" rel="nofollow"></a></strong><blockquote><strong><a href="http://www.fas.org/irp/facility/Chapter3.htm" rel="nofollow">Professor Des Ball, also from the Strategic and Defence Studies Centre at the Australian National University</a></strong> but who gave evidence in his private capacity.Professor Ball has published many articles and books on Defence related issues, including a series of publications about Joint Defence Facilities in Australia.

It added, "It does not make business or technical sense to route domestic calls via another country. Doing so will incur additional and unnecessary network resources, including costly international bandwidth, and degrade the quality of service."<br><br>Foreign Ministry's spokesman Kitti Wasinondh hit back Wednesday.<strong> "I am puzzled by the statement from Singapore's Foreign Ministry that they do not understand the remarks of Gen Sondhi. It is not appropriate for Singapore to issue such a statement."<br><br>"If Singapore wants clarification of the remarks, Singapore can send its ambassador to Gen Sondhi," </strong>the spokesman told reporters.<br><br>Sondhi said last week that the army has a problem now. "When we make a call, the line goes to Singapore. When we talk secrets, they go straight to Singapore."<br><br>The bickering started last week after Thai government expressed anger over Singapore's hospitality to ousted Prime Thaksin during a visit earlier this month. Thaksin met with Singapore's deputy prime minister, prompting Thailand to suspend a visit by Singapore's foreign minister. Bangkok called the meeting inappropriate given Thaksin's ouster from the government, but Singapore insisted that it was private visit between old friends. </blockquote></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Singaporean are used to be the second talking Cork winner in the last century but however due to the Special Traning by our Leaders we had become the number one winner . We can really be sure  that no one can win us ever .<br><br>Singapore Shine against our neighbour , we always say that we are small but big with something . Har!!!!!!!!! That unconsious proudness never leave us .<br><br>For the Thailand situation with Singapore , I can feel that the people here would really like to stuck our personal big Gun to the Gen. throat so that he could not distort our relationship by his personal comment without any base of truth . If you ask me do we like to start a fight with such a fool-ly oldman then the answer is clear , Look at Taksin , he is staying away from him , letting him do whatever he want , say whatever he think , the pressure is on Soothi corner but he is not handling well so what's next ??? Think Soldier !! Think !!! Soothi is not someone who can be in politic , this is something the Educated People like us understand . For the Thais they have the Anti-Singapore feel all because of one man comment , they just don't care , these hardcore Thais loyal are nothing just as fool as soothi So why are we talking to fools while we can actually wait and see the real fight a few years later .<br><br>Just sharing .<br><br>Regards<br><br></div>
