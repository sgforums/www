            <div class='col-md body'>"Mr Sibeh is too immersed in his fantasy world of C&amp;C. He is unable to pull himself out of the game even when the game is not running on his PC. apparently, the game is still running, maybe in an infinite loop or a severe 'division by zero' error, in his brain (yes, he do have one minus the small size). Hence, unless we can stop the process path of RA.exe (Generals.exe in the case of C&amp;C Generals) in his brain, we are unable, using current technology, to help Mr Sibeh in his problem. We are currently closely monitoring the situation and will submit a formal report in a few weeks time to his parents to conclude if he still requires treatment here. Under normal conditions, he is deemed suitable, for both the public and his personal wellbeing, to go out alone without supervision from us or his parents. We have already suggested, to both Mr Sibeh and his parents, to slowly cut down the amount of time he spends playing war-related games like Command &amp; Conquer, Medal of Honour etc. We have also found out that he like to assume a role of a top secret government official who has many spies working for him and has access to all top-secret documents. We have already advised his parents to keep on re-inforcing to him that the fact is he is just a normal person and not what he THOUGHT himself to be. If he do not snap out of fantasy and embrace reality as it is, he will require a longer course of treatment here. This is something that we will not like to see. (although our pockets will enjoy it though...)"<br><br>Signed Dr A.<br><br>dis should explain his behaviour.... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_twisted.gif" alt="Twisted Evil" title="Twisted Evil"></div>
