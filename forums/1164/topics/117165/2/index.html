            <div class='col-md body'>Seriously, theres a huge different between myths &amp; historical facts.  So unless MunnaBhai_MBBS can prove what he said is not a myth, he's no different from the North Koreans who still believed that they are not killing themselves slowly by isolating themselves from the rest of the world.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>what i was referring to was intelligent warfare....not some primitive instinct driven one....get  that right...even an animal will retaliate when threatened....<strong>thre is a difference between research and propaganda...do not make stupid comparisons with Iraq or PAP, fools...</strong>goodbye..<br><br>U want the proofs?.....well there are indicatins of proof like the mercury found by russian scientists.and testimony by Alexander the Great when he invaded India...dozens f ancient texts....do u think these people have nothing better to do then write thusands of pages of crap?....well since u pple talk so much...then how were the pyramids of Egypt built?..how was stonehenge constucted....no one knows or sure..but they are there .but investigations are still going on...But u cant deny the fact that somehow these feats were accomplished in ancient times without any sort of modern tools..and only advanced civilisations with brains could do this...not some primitive ape...now explaint that....the moment someone posts abt India...u start asking for proof.... <strong>legends of giant squid and animals were prevalent during ancient times..now they have evidence that Giant Squid really exist and giant oyster fossils were found along with other animals living today...there were in fact giant versions of present day animals like the deer and sloth</strong> ./..another nail in yr coffin....<br><br>watch some discovery programs like Unsolved History or Civilisations to gather some info before posting....Recently Discovery aired a program on Raja the Great, a well known ancient Kng from India...he built hundred of megastructures throughout India....Investigators were baffled how he was able to build such structures in a short amount of time..investigations according to the program reveals that tell tale signs similar to the  mercury have led archeologists to some tantalsing info that the key to the King's success was that he used dozens of Elephants to quarry stones...supposeldy ancient architects drilled small holes into the stones and placed wooden blocks , pored water over them....and when these wooden bloacks expanded, the broke up huge stones...then elephants were tasked to transport these stones to the cnstruction site...its only a tip in the iceberg....But still they could not figure out that such a method will still take time to accomplish..till now they haven find out the real picture yet....<strong>the proof is there right in front of your eyes u fools, in the form of stonehenge, raja's temples and Pyramids, its because of these proof that archeologists and scientist conclude that India had n fact an advanced civilisation!...</strong></div>
