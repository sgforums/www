            </div>
            <div class='col-md body'>What we know about ancient Indian flying vehicles comes from ancient Indian sources; written texts that have come down to us through the centuries.<br><br>There is no doubt that most of these texts are authentic; many are the well-known ancient Indian Epics themselves, and there are literally hundreds of them.  Most of them have not even been translated into English yet from the old sanskrit.<br><br>The Indian Emperor Ashoka started a "Secret Society of the Nine Unknown Men": great Indian scientists who were supposed to catalogue the many sciences.  Ashoka kept their work secret because he was afraid that the advanced science catalogued by these men, culled from ancient Indian sources, would be used for the evil purpose of war, which Ashoka was strongly against, having been converted to Buddhism after defeating a rival army in a bloody battle.<br><br>The "Nine Unknown Men" wrote a total of nine books, presumably one each.  Book number was "The Secrets of Gravitation!" This book, known to historians, but not actually seen by them dealt chiefly with "gravity control."<br><br>It is presumably still around somewhere, kept in a secret library in India, Tibet or elsewhere (perhaps even in North America somewhere).  One can certainly understand Ashoka's reasoning for wanting to keep such knowledge a secret, assuming it exists.  if the Nazis had such weapons at their disposal during World War Ii.  Ashoka was also aware devastating wars using such advanced vehicles and other 'futuristic weapons' that had destroyed the ancient Indian "Rama Empire" several thousand years before.<br><br>Only a few years ago, the Chinese discovered some sanskrit documents in Lhasa, Tibet and sent them to the University of Chandrigarh to be translated.  Dr. Ruth Reyna of the University said recently that the documents contain directions for building interstellar spaceships!<br><br>Their method of propulsion, she said, was "anti-gravitational" and was based upon a system analogous to that of "laghima," the unknown power of the ego existing in man's physiological makeup, "a centrifugal force strong enough to counteract all gravitational pull." According to Hindu Yogis, it is this "laghima" which enables a person to levitate.<br><br>Dr.  Reyna said that on board these machines, which were called "Astras" by the text, the ancient Indians could have sent a detachment of men onto any planet, according to the document, which is thought to be thousands of years old.<br><br>The manuscripts were also said to reveal the secret of "antima"; "the cap of invisibility"<br>and "garima"; "how to become as heavy as a mountain of lead."<br><br>Naturally, Indian scientists did not take the texts very seriously, but then became more positive about the value of them when the Chinese announced that they were including certain parts of the data for study in their space program!<br><br>This was one of the first instances of a government admitting to be researching anti-gravity.<br><br>The manuscripts did not say definitely that interplanetary travel was ever made but did mention, of all things, a planned trip to the Moon, though it is not clear whether this trip was actually carried out.  However, one of the great Indian epics, the Ramayana, does have a highly detailed story in it of a trip to the moon in a Vimana (or "Astra"), and in fact details a battle on the moon with an "Asvin" (or Atlantean" airship.<br><br>This is but a small bit of recent evidence of anti-gravity and aerospace technology used by Indians.  To really understand the technology, we must go much further back in time.<br><br>The so-called "Rama Empire" of Northern India and Pakistan developed at least fifteen thousand years ago on the Indian sub-continent and was a nation of many large, sophisticated cities, many of which are still to be found in the deserts of Pakistan, northern, and western India.<br><br>Rama existed, apparently, parallel to the Atlantean civilization in the mid-Atlantic Ocean, and was ruled by "enlightened Priest-Kings" who governed the cities, The seven greatest capital cities of Rama were known in classical Hindu texts as "The Seven Rishi Cities."<br><br>According to ancient Indian texts, the people had flying machines, which were called "Vimanas."<br>The ancient Indian epic describes a Vimana as a double-deck, circular aircraft with portholes and a dome, much as we would imagine a flying saucer.<br><br>It flew with the "speed of the wind" and gave forth a "melodious sound." There were at least four different types of Vimanas; some saucer shaped others like long cylinders ("cigar shaped airships").<br><br>The ancient Indian texts on Vimanas are so numerous, it would take volumes to relate what they had to say.  The ancient Indians, who manufactured these ships themselves, wrote entire flight manuals on the control of the various types of Vimanas, many of which are still in existence, and some have even been translated into English.<br><br>The Samara Sutradhara is a scientific treatise dealing with every possible angle of air travel in a Vimana.  There are 230 stanzas dealing with the construction, take-off, cruising for thousand of miles, normal and forced landings, and even possible collisions with birds.<br><br>In 1875, the Vaimanika Sastra, a fourth century B.C.  text written by Bharadvajy the Wise, using even older texts as his source, was rediscovered in a temple in India.<br><br>It dealt with the operation of Vimanas and included information on the steering, precautions for long flights, protection of the airships from storms and lightening and how to switch the drive to "solar energy" from a free energy source which sounds like "anti-gravity."<br><br>The Vaimanika Sastra (or Vymaanika-Shaastra) has eight chapters with diagrams, describing three types of aircraft, including apparatuses that could neither catch on fire nor break.<br><br>It also mentions 31 essential parts of these vehicles and 16 materials from which they are constructed, which absorb light and heat; for which reason they were considered suitable for the construction of Vimanas.<br><br>This document has been translated into English and is available by writing the publisher:<br>VYMAANIDASHAASTRA AERONAUTICS by Maharishi Bharadwaaja, translated into English and edited, printed and published by Mr.  G.  R.  Josyer, Mysore, India, 1979 (sorry, no street address).  Mr.<br>Josyer is the director of the International Academy of Sanskrit Investigation located in Mysore.<br><br>There seems to be no doubt that Vimanas were powered by some sort of "anti-gravity."<br>Vimanas took off vertically, and were capable of hovering in the sky, like a modern helicopter or dirigible.  Bharadvajy the Wise refers to no less than 70 authorities and 10 experts of air travel in antiquity.  These sources are now lost.<br><br>Vimanas were kept in a Vimana Griha, a kind of hanger, and were sometimes said to be propelled by a yellowish-white liquid, and sometimes by some sort of mercury compound, though writers seem confused in this matter.  It is most likely that the later writers on Vimanas, wrote as observers and from earlier texts, and were understandably confused on the princible of their propulsion.<br><br>The "yellowishwhite liquid" sounds suspiciously like gasoline, and perhaps Vimanas had a number of different propulsion sources, including combustion engines and even "pulse-jet"<br>engines.<br><br>It is interesting to note, that the Nazis developed the first practical pulse-jet engines for their V-8 rocket "buzz bombs." Hitler and the Nazi staff were exceptionally interested in ancient India and Tibet and sent expeditions to both these places yearly, starting in the 30's, in order to gather esoteric evidence that they did so, and perhaps it was from these people that the Nazis gained some of their scientific information!<br><br>According to the Dronaparva, part of the Mahabarata, and the Ramayana, one Vimana described was shaped like a sphere and born along at great speed on a mighty wind generated by mercury.  It moved like a UFO, going up, down, backwards and forwards as the pilot desired.<br><br>In another Indian source, the Samar, Vimanas were "iron machines, well-knit and smooth, with a charge of mercury that shot out of the back in the form of a roaring flame."<br><br>Another work called the Samaranganasutradhara describes how the vehicles were constructed.  It is possible that mercury did have something to do with the propulsion, or more possibly, with the guidance system.<br><br>Curiously, Soviet scientists have discovered what they call "age-old instruments used in navigating cosmic vehicles" in caves in Turkestan and the Gobi Desert.  The "devices" are hemispherical objects of glass or porcelain, ending in a cone with a drop of mercury inside.<br><br>It is evident that ancient Indians flew around in these vehicles, all over Asia, to Atlantis presumably; and even, apparently, to South America.<br><br>n the Mahavira of Bhavabhuti, a Jain text of the eighth century culled from older texts and traditions, we read: "An aerial chariot, the Pushpaka, conveys many people to the capital of Ayodhya.<br><br>The sky is full of stupendous flying-machines, dark as night, but picked out by lights with a yellowish glare-"<br><br>The Vedas, ancient Hindu poems, thought to be the oldest of all the Indian texts, describe Vimanas of various shapes and sizes: the "ahnihotra-vimana" with two engines, the "elephant-vimana" with more engines, and other types named after the kingfisher, ibis and other animals.<br><br>Unfortunately, Vimanas, like most scientific discoveries, were ultimately used for war.<br><br>Atlanteans used their flying machines, 'Vailixi'.  a similar type of aircraft, to literally try and subjugate the world, it would seem, if Indian texts are to be believed.<br><br>The Atlanteans, known as "Asvins" in the Indian writings, were apparently even more advanced technologically than the Indians, and certainly of a more war-like temperament.  Although no ancient texts on Atlantean Vailixi are known to exist, some information has come down through esoteric, "occult" sources, which describe their flying machines.<br><br>Similar, if not identical to Vimanas, Vailixi were generally "cigar shaped" and had the capability of maneuvering underwater as well as in the atmosphere or even outer space.<br><br>Other vehicles, like Vimanas, were saucer shaped, and could apparently also be submerged.<br><br>According to Eklal Kueshana, author of "The Ultimate Frontier," in an article he wrote in<br>1966, Vailixi were first developed in Atlantis 20,000 years ago, and the most common ones are "saucer shaped of generally trapezoidal cross-section with three hemispherical engine pods on the underside." "They use a mechanical antigravity device driven by engines developing approximately 80,000 horse power."<br><br>The Ramayana, Mahabarata and other texts speak of the hideous war that took place, some ten or twelve thousand years ago between Atlantis and Rama using weapons of destruction that could not be imagined by readers until the second half of this century.<br><br>The ancient Mahabharata, one of the sources on Vimanas, goes on to tell the awesome destructiveness of the war: "...(the weapon was) a single projectile charged with all the power of the Universe.  An incandescent column of smoke and flame As bright as the thousand suns rose in all its splendor...  An iron thunderbolt, A gigantic messenger of death, Which reduced to ashes The entire race of the Vrishnis And the Andhakas.<br><br>.  .  .  the corpses were so burned As to be unrecognizable.<br><br>The hair and nails fell out; Pottery broke without apparent cause, And the birds turned white.<br><br>...  After a few hours All foodstuffs were infected...<br><br>...  to escape from this fire The soldiers threw themselves in streams To wash themselves and their equipment..."<br><br>It would seem that the Mahabharata is describing an atomic war!  References like this one are not isolated; but battles, using a fantastic array of weapons and aerial vehicles are common in all the epic Indian books.<br><br>One even describes a Vimana-Vailix battle on the Moon!  The above section very accurately describes what an atomic explosion would look like and the effects of the radioactivity on the population.  Jumping into water is the only respite.<br><br>When the Rishi City of Mohenjodaro was excavated by archeologists in the last century, they found skeletons just lying in the streets, some of them holding hands, as if some great doom had suddenly overtaken them.<br><br>These skeletons are among the most radioactive ever found, on a par with those found at Hiroshima and Nagasaki.<br>Ancient cities whose brick and stone walls have literaly been vitrified, that is-fused together, can be found in India, Ireland, Scotland, France, Turkey and other places. There is no logical explanation for the vitrification of stone forts and cities, except from an atomic blast.<br><br>It is interesting to note that when Alexander the Great invaded India more than two thousand years ago, his historians chronicled that at one point they were attacked by "flying, fiery shields" that dove at his army and frightened the cavalry..</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>check this out :<br><a href="http://www.pip.com.au/~paceman/ANCIENT%20ATOMIC%20BLAST.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.pip.com.au/~paceman/ANCIENT%20ATOMIC%20BLAST.html</a><br><br>Radiation still so intense, the area is highly dangerous.<br><br>A heavy layer of radioactive ash in Rajasthan, India, covers a three-square mile area, ten miles west of Jodhpur. Scientists are investigating the site, where a housing development was being built.<br><br>For some time it has been established that there is a very high rate of birth defects and cancer in the area under construction. The levels of radiation there have registered so high on investigators' gauges that the Indian government has now cordoned off the region. Scientists have unearthed an ancient city where evidence shows an atomic blast dating back thousands of years, from 8,000 to 12,000 years, destroyed most of the buildings and probably a half-million people. One researcher estimates that the nuclear bomb used was about the size of the ones dropped on Japan in 1945.<br><br>The Mahabharata clearly describes a catastrophic blast that rocked the continent. "A single projectile charged with all the power in the Universe...An incandescent column of smoke and flame as bright as 10,000 suns, rose in all its splendor...it was an unknown weapon, an iron thunderbolt, a gigantic messenger of death which reduced to ashes an entire race.<br><br>"The corpses were so burned as to be unrecognizable. Their hair and nails fell out, pottery broke without any apparent cause, and the birds turned white.<br><br>"After a few hours, all foodstuffs were infected. To escape from this fire, the soldiers threw themselves into the river."<br><br>A HISTORIAN COMMENTS<br><br>Historian Kisari Mohan Ganguli says that Indian sacred writings are full of such descriptions, which sound like an atomic blast as experienced in Hiroshima and Nagasaki. He says references mention fighting sky chariots and final weapons. An ancient battle is described in the Drona Parva, a section of the Mahabharata. "The passage tells of combat where explosions of final weapons decimate entire armies, causing crowds of warriors with steeds and elephants and weapons to be carried away as if they were dry leaves of trees," says Ganguli.<br><br>"Instead of mushroom clouds, the writer describes a perpendicular explosion with its billowing smoke clouds as consecutive openings of giant parasols. There are comments about the contamination of food and people's hair falling out."<br><br>ARCHEOLOGICAL INVESTIGATION PROVIDES INFORMATION<br><br>Archeologist Francis Taylor says that etchings in some nearby temples he has managed to translate suggest that they prayed to be spared from the great light that was coming to lay ruin to the city. "It's so mid-boggling to imagine that some civilization had nuclear technology before we did. The radioactive ash adds credibility to the ancient Indian records that describe atomic warfare."<br><br>Construction has halted while the five member team conducts the investigation. The foreman of the project is Lee Hundley, who pioneered the investigation after the high level of radiation was discovered.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Giant Unexplained Crater Near Bombay<br><br>Another curious sign of an ancient nuclear war in India is a giant crater near Bombay. The nearly circular 2,154-metre-diameter Lonar crater, located 400 kilometres northeast of Bombay and aged at less than 50,000 years old, could be related to nuclear warfare of antiquity.<br><br>No trace of any meteoric material, etc., has been found at the site or in the vicinity, and this is the world's only known "impact" crater in basalt. Indications of great shock (from a pressure exceeding 600,000 atmospheres) and intense, abrupt heat (indicated by basalt glass spherules) can be ascertained from the site.<br><br>David Hatcher Childress in Nexus Magazine</div>
