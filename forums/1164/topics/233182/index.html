            <div class='col-md body'>Whether the choice is clear Taksin is a human , The King is a Human as well , they do make selfish mistake .<br><br>Taksin is really someone who love his mother land .<br><br>He is still the best leader Thailand had . I think many will agree because the fact is that The Thais is out of the debt problem most earlier than some other Asian country . And I remember a few years ago Mr Goh C.T had mention about Taksin , Mr Goh said that Taksin is someone who will uphold his promises and make things happen . Of cause one example is not good enough , comparing the leader before him will surely make you puiiiiiii .. for this are we able to figure out what he had done for his Country .<br><br>I actually feel that Thailand is filled with greedy Leader and money is all they can think of . Taksin is greedy but I think he give his best for his country comparing to others and things are actually moving forward , in Thailand what some people most fear is having a PM not like Taksin .<br><br>An example which I would like to share about how corruptive is the present situation . They set bars for investor making every investor panic selling stock while their own players come in to buy at lower price , gain from the different resell again and make money , of cause to your knowledge these are only operated with very low profile but high power people , someone behind the coup and behind Sonti . Another trick they gain is from their money exchange , sometime back , it shoot down and all of a sudden it shoot way up , bath become very strong and all suddenly  it fell again and this time lower than before . It is just as simple as that - you buy foreign $ at low price with strong bath and sell foreign $ with weak bath , we already saw it once at the lates 90s.<br><br>Thailand is actually own by the Royale Kingdom . No one can say that it is not a fact . PM is always someone who is under the Kingdom employment after election . The soldier give their loyalty to the Land of Thais and the Kingdom . The Gov. control every aspect of how the country run and the Army Control thread from others . It was always a issue when Taksin was in power that he had disrespect the Royales as he gain more support and respect from the Thais than the King himself , his enemy will tried to make to make a point that the Kingdom belong to the King and not Taksin , wasn't this a jealousy act to make him a bad guy in front of his respected King . To my knowledge , 4 years ago during the King Birthday Speech , Taksin was being commented about how he manage the Country , the King like to indirectly tell someone about his views so we can feel that no matter how good is a person something still can affect them and how they think of you .<br><br>Just sharing<br><br>Regards <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"><br></div>

What have they done so far that is setting a direction towards economic recovery?<br><br>If they were really serious about getting Thailand back on track, what WON'T be at the TOP of priorities is upsetting relations with Singapore, making baseless accusations, and throwing a hissy fit just cos their ex-PM comes to have Ba Kut Teh, and unofficial lunches with Singapore officials.<br><br>War? Please... think of something more constructive.<br><br>**PS: We oughta help them convert the Chakri Naruebet into a diving wreck at Phuket.

He has a right to sell them as he pleases. The company nor his shares do not belong to the people of Thailand but to HIM. Besides, everyone who's anti-Thaksin had been talking bad about him because of those shares, saying that his economic policies benefit his company. So what's the man to do?<br><br>Hold on to the shares = Thais angry<br>Sell his shares = Thais angry<br><br>Also, the Thai economy getting from bad to worse. Is it Thaksin's doing? Was he even in any position to make the economy go into decline? Or are you a victim of a certain organisation's spin doctors that led you to believe he even had a hand in this decline? You people seem to forget who brought the Thai economy to it's former heights before the coup.<br><br><strong>Again before FreeAgent comes in here and starts pointing fingers, I'm just stating FACTS and not taking sides.</strong></div>
