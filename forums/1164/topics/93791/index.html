In the MIOPS scenario, FPDA forces exercised procedures to localise and interdict a vessel. The MIOPS serial was part of EX BERSAMA LIMA 04, a major joint FPDA exercise conducted in the South China Sea and the airspace of Peninsular Malaysia and Singapore.<br><br>Non-conventional threat scenarios such as maritime security will feature increasingly in FPDA exercises. In June, the FPDA Defence Ministers recognised the need for the FPDA to adapt to new challenges in the regional security environment and endorsed a set of proposals for increased cooperation to tackle non-conventional security threats such as maritime terrorism.<br><br><img src="http://www.ourairforce.org/images/14Sep04_fpda04_big.jpg"><img src="http://www.ourairforce.org/images/14Sep04_fpda03_big.jpg"><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Disagree somewhat. Yes, conventional warfare, you are not likely to have hand-hand combat nowadays. The last company size infantry bayonet charge was in Korean or Vietnam war ... can't remember which. Ended up some kind of hand-hand fight.<br><br>But the issue is that in this kind of interdiction operations, you are supposed not to fire indiscriminately. It is a kind of police search operation where once you find contraband , you are supposed to effect an arrest under UN or whatever international law. Very likely in this kind of scenario, your arrest subject may try to fight his way out, not with weapons, but will try to punch / kick to resist arrest and try to escape. This is when size matters to overcome the subject.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Well rules are one thing, but what happens in reality is another. Yes, obviously you don't just board the ship &amp; shoot anything that moves. If the crew cooperates then obviously there is no need for bloodshed.<br><br>But if the crew is highly uncooperative &amp; even gets violent, then wat are you gonna do? You try to restrain them &amp; if say they whip out weapons or try to grab your weapons, then obviously you have no choice but to defend yourself by any means necessary, even if that means opening fire.<br><br>These gentlemen who took part in this exercise are from the armed forces. And if I'm not mistaken, the armed forces have different ROE from the police.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>If they boarding party is from the military Navy, then a gunship( helicopter ) or the ship's main guns are trained on the target ship for cover.<br><br>The target ship is usually called to stall its engine before the boarding party is deployed.  If the target ship refuses, warning shots are fires across the bowl( forgotten the spelling ).  Usually that does the trick.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_twisted.gif" alt="Twisted Evil" title="Twisted Evil"><br><br>Like military operators who board a hijack airliners, Navy operators board a ship with an alert level that is extremely stressful.  So if you have an item in your hand that looks like a trigger to an expolsive device, chances are you'll be subdue before you get a chance to explain.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cry.gif" alt="Crying or Very sad" title="Crying or Very sad"><br><br>However, for the coast guards, their rules are much different.  U.S Coast Guards before 9/11 only carried M16s &amp; pump guns which is generally used more offen.  Today, they have a wider varity of arms &amp; the C.G helicopter is armed with a M249.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_neutral.gif" alt="Neutral" title="Neutral"><br><br>During the start of the Iraq conflict, ships going towards Iraq are usually introduced to the experience of a .50 cal sniper shot from either a Marine sniper or a Navy SEALs sniper.  And the boarding parties aren't very concern about being friendly or diplomatical.  I believed a S'pore registar container ship was also boarded during that time.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"></div>
