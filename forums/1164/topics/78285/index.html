            <div class='col-md body'>Ok mates,any idea why RSAF chose the Boeing AH-64D and AH-64 Apache?Just doing a comparision here.As during the period when the RSAF was selecting the gunships that period if I didn't remember wrongly,these were the few choppers on shortlisted.<br><br>There seems to be very few countries using the EuroCopter Tiger and there is little news about the Russian Hokum also.Always in the news is the American Super Cobra and Apache.<br><br>Also to side-track alittle,is there anyone in RSAF here?I have a burning question,why isn't our UH-1H Hueys used as gunships like in the Vietnam war?When it has been proven to be an effective gunship.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hey,anyway,what is the anti-air capabilities of the Cobra vs.Apache vs.EuroCopter Tiger vs. Hokum?It seems all these gunships are about are against tanks and ground units.And btw,if i didn't remember wrongly,it is said that the EuroCopter Tiger is anti-electromagnetic pulse attacks.So why didn't the RSAF choose the EuroCopter Tiger instead?</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>SpecOp87,<br><br>Cobra, Apache, Eurocopter and Hokum, all can be fixed with short-range heat seeking missile. Think Hokum will have the advantage of speed but the rest will have the advantage of better IR protection in air to air.<br><br>US has been the pioneer in the field of electro-magnetic pulse(EMP). During the cold war the US have done a lot of research on EMP, because at that time there is a high chance russia may consider using EMP. Therefore expect most US expensive weapon system have EMP resistance. Don't forget Apache is design to fight war including in nuclear war scenerio, like other weapon system.</div>
