The "Operation Valiant Strike" in Kandahar was launched almost simultaneously with the Iraq war.<br><br>On the second day of the "Operation Desert Lion," troops from the 2nd battalion, 505th parachute infantry regiment discovered two caches that included 25 107 mm rockets, 72 122 mm mortar rounds, 40 82 mm recoilless rifle rounds, 100 82 mm mortar rounds, and 122 cases of 12.7 mm machine gun ammunition, along with numerous fuses.

            <div class='col-md body'>North Korea better think more about feeding its own people then rushing with their army to take the south.<br><br>Besides, I can't imagine the shock and awe the North Koreans will face when they discover that the great leader had been lying to them all along and that they were actually the only ones suffering (North Koreans, incidently, happen to believe via propangada that they are the richest most advanced country in the world, and that the south is even poorer then them!) At that time, kim is gonna have a lot of explaining to do, esp if he cann secure a quick victory, which is most probably cannot.<br><br>Whatdaya think, that such a heavily globalized south korean people would just bend over and embrace the North when they roll in with their tanks? I think it's a pipe deam that the average North Korean unfortunately believe to be true. After all, who cares what political idealogy you may have, communism or capatalist, as long as it fills your stomache?</div>
