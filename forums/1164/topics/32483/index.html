He says that in a crowded water way like the Singapore and Malcaa strait, it is difficult to use the harpoon because chances are that there will be many ships in the vicinity of the target. Hence there would be an increase chance that a neutral target is hit if a Fire and forget missile is used because the fire and forget missiles function in such a way that it will fly to the coordinates given and after which its radar will home on to the target. Hence if there is more than 1 vessel in the vincinity of the target, there will be a chance that a friendly or neutral target might be hit. As the gabriel is wireguided, it prevents such a problem from happening becasue the missile controller with the aid of a joystick can steer the missile manually towards the target preventing such an incident from happening.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Wire guided? Hmm, an established method of defeating such missiles was to fire AA flack bursts towards it, hoping that the sharpnel will cut the wire, sending the missile otta control.<br><br>Speaking of ack ack, everytime I go aerospace, I see ST Kinetics advertising a locally produced 30mm shell that explodes in a forward shower of tiny tungsten cubes. Supposed to be for our ack ack guns covering the island. From the damage I can see to the target drone, pretty impressive for 30mm flack, more concentrated and penetrating then most 30mm shell bursts.</div>

Just imagine now with 1 fearless class vessel damaged there is already so much public outcry of neglegence. Just think what would happen if a harpoon missile from an MCV accidentally hits a Cargo vessel or even worse an ocean liner. The harpoon was built to hit over the horizon for blue water engagements and are not so suittable for the reason as mentioned earlier. Just food for thought, did you realise that in the gulf war, no exocet or harpoon was fired against the iraqi navy. Instead most of the kills were scored using Super Lynx and US Naval fighters using the Sea Skua and LGB respectively because the allies could not risk a stray missile hitting neutral shipping. Also to answer the question on enemy ships hidding among Neutral shipping yup it is certainly possible especially in international waters and crowded waterways.</div>

Especially if the stealth frigates and perhaps the future subs can be armed with block 2 harpoons. The subs will sneak via the south china sea to butterworth while another sneaks into the coast of kuantan. While a couple of frigates moves on to the coast of lumut where the RMN base is. And launch the harpoons simutaneously against Naval and A Force targets which can be immediately followed by A-4 and F-16 air to Ground strikes. Targetted at destroying the runways, hardened aircraft shelters and naval docks and Barracks of the aircrew and naval crew. This swift move will take out the MAF and the RMN simutaneously. This can be followed by and amphibious assault into Johor via the Kranji With FH-2000 support to blow up the Army barracks in Johor baru. This can be followed by addition strike by apaches and A-4 against the major Army headquarters and kota tinggi. And before they know it Johor will be singing majula Singapura</div>

However, have you considered that the Exocet is about the only capable antiship missile owned by Iraq as the SS-2 Stylx will certainly not hit the anything. Also with the tanker war at its peak at that point in time it did not really matter whether the missiles hit Stark or not as it would be perfectly ok if the missile had hit a merchent ships.</div>
