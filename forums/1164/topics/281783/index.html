But I sort of need some info and advice.<br><br>Does anyone take political science here (esp from NUS)?  Is it hard to "get into" PS, in a sense?<br><br>I'll be graduating from poly soon, and I recently found interest in PS.  Managed to get some introduction textbooks on PS and actually found the reading quite enjoyable and educational.  But I'm not sure if its possible for me to get into it since I'll graduating with a diploma in infocomms tech.  Its like worlds apart.<br><br>Anyone with info, pls feel free to pm me.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>My advice is before you take up this subject, consider what kind of jobs you are want to be in that accepts PS as a skill.<br><br>Private sector here has basically no need for graduates in this field (regardless you are a MASTERS or even PhD grad).  The only avenue that PS grads are desired are from MFA, but you MUST NOT stop at just a degree but go until Honours, cos' the minimal entry is Honours.  Mind you MFA is not like the US State Dept where they have offices in almost in every countries.<br><br>MFA presence is not prevalent and the empty slots is verty minimal, so unless you are sponsored or on scholarship from the Govt, think twice on the industries that is receptive to PS grads before you take up this ccourse.  This course is a good course but Singapore is not the place where PS grads can find jobs easily.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>while i have been following thread, have seldom posted, but feel compelled to clarify.<br><br>i graduated from NUS PS in 94, and have been a teacher, and a poly lecturer before becoming a researcher in the civil service. Among my PS classmates, there are many varied careers - 3 are lecturers in NUS, there are quite a few civil servants including in MFA, MINDEF, MCYS, NYC, NHB, NLB, MHA, as well as quite few in the pte sector, including some really interesting ones like Hour Glass =)<br><br>my point is - while a person's training may have relevance in the career, it does not necessarily restricts one's career options. PS, in this instance, seeks to broaden one's perspectives and refine one's analytical skills, while sharpening yr writing, particularly in framing political devts. hopes that clarifies<br><br>all the best =)</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>PS is not a dead-end subject. You can be employed in many areas of the govt(and not only MFA). you can also try to get into MNCs, banks, and many other industries!... key thing is you should gun for honours if you're doing PS.
