              <p>U.K. <span class="highlight">Warthog</span> Armored Truck Delayed<br> By ANDREW CHUTER<br> Published: 23 Apr 2010 11:34<br> Print  Print  |  Print  Email<br> <br> LONDON - Introduction of a new Singaporean-built armored vehicle 
              destined for the British Army in Afghanistan is behind schedule, 
              according to the Ministry of Defence's procurement minister Quentin 
              Davis.<br> Despite promises to speed up delivery of the <span class="highlight">Warthog</span> to British forces, there continue to be delays in the project. (U.K. 
              MINISTRY OF DEFENCE)<br> <br> Last year, Prime Minister Gordon Brown promised to speed up the delivery
               of the articulated <span class="highlight">Warthog</span> vehicles to 
              better protect the troops fighting the Taliban. Just over 110 Warthogs 
              were ordered in a 2008 deal valued at 150 million pounds ($230 million) 
              between Singapore Technologies Kinetics and the Ministry of Defence.<br> Related Topics<br> <br> * Europe<br> * Asia &amp; Pacific Rim<br> * Land Warfare<br> <br> The Warthogs, purchased as an urgent operational requirement, were meant
               to replace the smaller and less protected BAE Systems Viking Mk1 
              machines in theater starting this month.<br> <br> In an interview last month, Davis, who keeps a scale model of <span class="highlight">Warthog</span> on the coffee table of his MoD office, 
              admitted the program had suffered delays.<br> <br> The first Warthogs were handed over to the British on time last year 
              from the Singapore factory of ST Kinetics, but the vehicle failed to 
              pass British acceptance tests. The first unit slated to get the <span class="highlight">Warthog</span>, a Royal Dragoon Guards regiment, is 
              deploying to Afghanistan without it.<br> <br> In response to a March 11 question in Parliament, Davis said no Warthogs
               had been delivered to the land forces by that date. He said delivery 
              was to be wrapped up by autumn.<br> <br> An MoD spokesman said the Dragoon Guards had trained on the vehicles and
               they were on "track for delivery in the summer" where they would be on 
              the front lines.<br> <br> Other sources said the vehicles could be up to six months behind 
              schedule.<br> <br> A spokeswoman for Thales UK, which has a 20 million pound vehicle 
              integration contract with ST Kinetics, said that training vehicles have 
              been handed over to the British military.<br> <br> "So far, we have delivered the required number of training vehicles to 
              the MoD and continue to work on the <span class="highlight">Warthog</span> at our west Wales site," she said.<br> <br> Industry and MoD sources said 2 tons of armor have been added to the 
              19-ton vehicle to counter improvised explosive devices in Helmand 
              province. That resolved the issue of blast protection but has created 
              knock-on problems with reliability, and wear and tear on components.<br> <br> The MoD spokesman said the vehicles were "undergoing extensive 
              reliability trials along with integration activities."<br> <br> The Warthogs have been undergoing trials at the armed forces Armored 
              Trials and Development Unit at Bovington in Dorset for several months.<br> <br> The Singaporean company wouldn't comment on why the <span class="highlight">Warthog</span> program was behind schedule, but in a 
              statement, Patrick Choy, executive vice president-international 
              marketing, acknowledged the vehicle would not enter service until later 
              this year.<br> <br> "ST Kinetics is working closely with the MoD and Thales UK to make <span class="highlight">Warthog</span> the most advanced all-terrain vehicle 
              of its class. We are pleased to know that the British soldiers in 
              Afghanistan will soon receive improved protection against mines and 
              increased mobility for all operations when <span class="highlight">Warthog</span> enters service later in the year," Choy said.<br> <br> <span class="highlight">Warthog</span> is the first armored vehicle 
              Britain has purchased from an Asian company.<br> <br> Brown has mentioned the platform more than once in response to criticism
               from political opponents and others over Britain's record in equipping 
              its forces in Afghanistan.<br> <br> Last September, Brown announced that <span class="highlight">Warthog</span> deliveries would be accelerated. The details of that move were never 
              released, but industry executives said they believed the government was 
              looking at compressing the program to get final deliveries earlier than 
              planned rather than speed introduction of the first vehicles.<br> <br> <span class="highlight">Warthog</span> is an uprated version of STK's 
              Bronco tracked all-terrain vehicle, which is in service with the 
              Singaporean armed forces.<br> <br> The deal was part of a 700 million pound package of urgent operational 
              equipment upgrades announced for Afghanistan in 2008 by then-Defence 
              Secretary John Hutton.<br> <br> The British ordered a version with better armor, longer range, different
               weapons and other changes.<br> <br> The British Royal Marines and the Army already operate the Viking Mk1 in
               Afghanistan. The vehicle has been criticized for its lack of 
              protection. The British ordered 24 of the improved Viking II vehicles 
              that had lost out to <span class="highlight">Warthog</span> to replace 
              the earlier model. The last of those Mk II vehicles were delivered 
              recently, and MoD sources said about half have been deployed to 
              Afghanistan with the Royal Marines.</p>

              <p>this is by far the most puzzle aspect of this deal.....did they buy first and test later? I recalled i had asked if they send one of those bronco to the sand for a "test" drive???</p>
              <p>lionnosy shot it down claiming that test report is enough.....</p>
