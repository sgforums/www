Destroyers primarily perform anti-submarine warfare duty while guided missile destroyers are<strong> multi-mission [Anti-Air Warfare (AAW), Anti-Submarine Warfare (ASW), and Anti-Surface Warfare (ASUW)] surface combatants.</strong> The addition of the Mk-41 Vertical Launch System or Tomahawk Armored Box Launchers (ABLs) to many Spruance-class destroyers has greatly expanded the role of the destroyer in strike warfare.</blockquote>2.<strong><a href="http://www.mindef.gov.sg/imindef/news_and_events/nr/2004/jul/03jul04_nr/03jul04_fs.html" rel="nofollow">How is Singapore  ''frigate'' look like</a></strong><br><blockquote><br>The frigates will be equipped with advanced state-of-the-art combat capabilities allowing them to perform a wide spectrum of missions and to deal with various threats in all dimensions of naval warfare<strong> Â¨C surface, air and underwater.<br></strong><br>Surveillance is provided by the Thales Herakles Multi-function Radar (MFR). As a three-dimensional search and fire control radar, the MFR is able to perform all round, long range air and surface surveillance, while simultaneously controlling weapons against hostile targets. The MFR is integrated with the Aster Surface-to-Air Missile (SAM) system.

The Aster is a two-stage missile with a powerful thrust and aerodynamic control to enable high agility and manoeuvrability.<br><br>The Anti-Submarine Warfare (ASW) capability of the frigate is provided by the EDO3 Active Low Frequency Towed Sonar (ALOFTS) system and the Eurotorp A244S torpedo.

            <div class='col-md body'>I doubt so, I think different countries have different ways to refer to a particular class of warship. It is usually a diplomatic move. For example PRC LUDA 4 type warship 051type carries 8Ashm, 16air defence missile, 2naval guns, 3anti-sub torps..... like dat they are also classified as destroyer. Just like the Soviets dun like to call their carrier as carrier but things like aircraft enabled cruisers.</div>

It has referred to a variety of ship roles and sizes. In the age of sail, it referred to a ship smaller and faster than a battleship, used for patrolling and escort work rather than fighting fleet actions. In modern military terminology, the definition of a frigate is a warship intended to protect other warships and merchant marine ships and as anti-submarine warfare (ASW) combatants for amphibious expeditionary forces, underway replenishment groups, and merchant convoys...<br><br>check <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frigate" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frigate</a><br><br></div>
