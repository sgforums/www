I was always curious, is there a reason why the divisions are numbered in multiples of three (e.g. 3rd Div, 6th Div &amp; 9th Div)?</blockquote>I think it's so primarily cuz the SAF divisions, prior to the combined-arms revamp, were primarily infantry-based. A lot depended on how the 1st few batches of NS soldiers ORD'd (given that not every active combat was simultaneously formed together in the 1st place) &amp; what the pioneering SAF planners chose to constitute as a functional brigade &amp; subsequently divisional strength. They eventually settled on threes, i.e. 3 reservist SIRs forming a SIB (INF), &amp; then 3 SIBs forming a DIV.<br><br>My uncle was one of the early NS recruits - sway-sway for him - &amp; he told me before that the first few reservist SIRs all numbered in the 50's, as in 50 SIR, 51 SIR, 52 SIR, et al. The latter 3 units formed the 1st reservist SIB (5 SIB). 5 SIB, 6 SIB &amp; 9 SIB eventually formed the 1st reservist DIV (6 DIV). If I'm correct, 10 SIB, 11 SIB &amp; 12 SIB subsequently formed 9 DIV, another reservist force.<br><br>3 DIV's status itself was always active since the early days when they were known as Area III Command (don't ask me why); they were the main military mobilization force during the '70s when it came to policing refugees, aiding flood victims &amp; the Hotel New World collapse. Unless I'm wrong, it comprises 2 SIB, 3 SIB &amp; 7 SIB (the future Guards).<br><br>There's one more brigade, 1 SIB, which I assume was standalone cuz it comprises an army HQ but PDF personnel (volunteers &amp; Merger remnants).<br><br>Still following? That leaves a pair of remaining numbers, "2" &amp; "4" which were allocated to SAF Armour, as 4 SAB (active) 8 SAB (reservist). All in all, it meant that sometime in the '70s, there was enough personnel to form combat brigades that neatly numbered between 1 &amp; 12, though in reality only the active ones can be said to be of a credible standard. For example, they didn't institutionalize IPPT as a fitness trial until 1980....</div>
