Eg. Go ask any green recruit which Arm the CIO is from and you can be sure the answer is Infantry, vice versa for the other Arms.<br><br>Not everyone knows everything unless they've been to quite a few places during service and I dun think they tell you alot of things when you're in your first year of service.
