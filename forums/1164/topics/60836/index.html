            <div class='col-md body'>BAE's Harrier GR.9 Upgrade Takes-off<br>By John Fricker/Overhaul &amp; Maintenance<br>October 30, 2003<br><br>The RAF's upgraded BAE Systems Harrier GR.9 prototype development aircraft (ZD320), a follow-on to GR.7/7A ground-attack fighter, made its initial flight from Warton in Lancashire, on May 30. Flown by BAE Systems test pilot John Lawson, ZD320 took off conventionally, for a successful 70-minute sortie, which included a short hover. The flight represented a significant milestone in a program that provides Harrier combat enhancements, with advanced mission system avionics, and smart weapons capabilities.<br><br>These are achieved by integration of High Order Language (ADA) software for the new open systems mission computer; a Mil-Std-1760 stores-management system; Northrop Grumman INS/GPS; ground proximity warning system (GPWS); upgraded display software and hardware; and secure communications links. In the summer, the GR.9 began a comprehensive test program to further develop the new systems and fully realize the potential of the new weapons and sensors in support of deep-strike operations well into the next decade.<br><br>A Â£150 million pound ($243.76 million) continuation contract was signed in January this year with BAE Systems Solutions &amp; Support. The full Â£500 million-plus Harrier GR.9 upgrade program will provide U.K. Joint Force operations with uprated digital systems and clearance for digital weapons, broadening RAF strike capabilities over a wider variety of targets, from longer ranges. This upgrade will introduce a base-line aircraft system capability to integrate and deliver smart weapons, such as MBDA's Brimstone, new 500-lb. Raytheon Paveway IV precision guided bombs, AGM-65D/G Maverick ASMs, and AIM-9L/BOL Sidewinder or MBDA ASRAAM AAMs.<br><br>The new equipment is being introduced in a phased series of capability releases (Cap A, B, C, etc.) to the customer in three production batches over the next five years. Cap A release is planned by BAE Systems in November 2004, for a February 2005 in-service date, while Cap B will add Brimstone and TIALD 500 targeting pod integration through the smart Mil-Std-1760 stores management system from December 2005. Cap C1 will facilitate Phase III dynamic weapon aiming, for Enhanced Paveway III and similar missiles from September 2006. Cap C2/D will integrate AGM-65G2 Maverick IR/TV versions; such precision-guided bombs as Paveway IV; and Raytheon's Mk 12 Successor IFF (SIFF) in 2006 to 2007.<br><br>Some GR.9s in the new program also will incorporate the uprated Rolls-Royce Pegasus Mk 107 engine, 30 of which are being installed in GR.7s in place of Mk 105s, to become GR.7As. These require replacement rear-fuselages to accommodate the new powerplants, which allow an increase in maximum take-off weight to 34,000 lbs., to improve the Harrier's hot-and-high performance envelope and extend carrier-based operations. Upgraded from GR.7/7As, the GR.9/9As will enhance the Harrier's existing capability for air-to-ground attack and reconnaissance. Navigation, data processing, thermal imaging, electronic warfare and communications capabilities are further improved in support of the smart weapon delivery system.<br><br>Joint Force Harrier will become an all-GR-equipped unit between 2004 and 2007, when its current Sea Harrier FA.2 air defense fighters are retired. Its planned four squadrons, instead of the current three each RAF and RN units, also will include 13 similarly upgraded T.10 two-seat combat trainers with GR.9 mission systems avionics, as Pegasus Mk 105-powered T.12s. Its 70 Harrier GR.9/9As will continue operating until being replaced from 2012 to 2015 by the U.K.'s new Future Joint Combat Aircraft (FJCA), for which up to 150 Lockheed Martin F-35B STOVL JSFs have been provisionally selected.<br><br>In association with Harrier fleet rationalization, BAE Systems is working with the MoD's Defense Logistic Organization (DLO) across a wide range of programs to streamline support infrastructures and processes, and to reduce costs by at least 20%, while improving availability and responsiveness. A joint BAE/MoD Harrier Future Integrated Support Team (FIST) is leading this process by seeking to optimize the total support chain through a fully-integrated and partnered approach. At the same time, this is planned to provide a proving ground for the type of support infrastructure envisaged for the JSF.<br><br>FIST will include representatives from all major agencies involved, including the Harrier Integrated Project Team (IPT); RAF Strike Command; BAE Systems CSS; and Rolls-Royce. Among key features of the FIST concept are single-site location for all major processes; rationalization of the supply change; a single joint technical authority; and adoption of lean techniques throughout the total support chain. The FIST team is co-located at RAF Wyton, with satellites at both RAF Cottesmore and Wittering Harrier bases.<br><br>This article appeared in Overhaul &amp; Maintenance's October 2003 issue.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Talking about the harrier and its improvements , don't you all think that it'll be a waste once the Brits get hold of their Eurofighter ? Maybe Singapore should buy them and base them on a small aircraft carrier and scare the living crap out of our neighbours especially Malaysia .  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"></div>
