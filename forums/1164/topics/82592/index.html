            <div class='col-md body'>Got this off the USN's website on CARAT 2004:<br><br>SINGAPORE -- The Republic of Singapore NavyÂ’s RSS Resolution (LST 20<img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"> was home to a first-time combined RSN-U.S. Navy command staff during the at-sea phase of exercise Cooperation Afloat Readiness and Training (CARAT) in the South China Sea June 6-9.<br><br>In the ultimate test of interoperability, Capt. Buzz Little, commander of Destroyer Squadron One and the U.S. CARAT Task Group, along with members of his staff and enlisted telecommunications specialists, embarked Resolution for three days to work side-by-side with his RSN counterpart, Col. Ng Chee Peng, commander of the RSNÂ’s 1st Flotilla and its CARAT task group during the exercise.<br><br>Â“I was honored to have the opportunity to work together with Col. Ng Chee Peng aboard the RSS Resolution. Our staffs demonstrated the highest level of professionalism and mutual respect for one another. The combined command was a success on many levels and has laid the groundwork for future exercise opportunities during CARAT Singapore,Â” Commodore Little said.<br><br>To communicate with other ships in the CARAT Task Group, the combined staff had at their fingertips two real-time computer systems, the Combined Enterprise Regional Information Exchange system (CENTRIX), and the Portable Allied Command, Control, Communications Terminal (PAC3T). The systems were installed in Resolution prior to getting underway and were intended to give USN and RSN ships secure communications capabilities while sharing a common operational picture of ship locations. This was the first time CENTRIX was used during CARAT and the first time the PAC3T system was installed in a CARAT ship.<br><br>Â“When CENTRIX was up and operating it was fantastic because it was our lifeline to the USN ships,Â” said Lt. Kevin Borden, Destroyer Squadron OneÂ’s combat systems officer, who was embarked in Resolution. CENTRIX allowed the U.S. ships to electronically chat with the combined staff on board Resolution, a method of communication that is common these days in the U.S. Navy. In this first use of CENTRIX during CARAT, the system shared an existing Resolution antenna that was also used for other shipboard business.<strong> Â“If we wouldÂ’ve had our own antenna, we wouldÂ’ve had constant contact,Â” </strong>Borden said, when discussing the technical success of the initiative, along with the first time challenges.<br><br>Â“ItÂ’s rare to do cryptological training with another nationÂ’s Navy. We have very similar capabilities but our systems are generally not compatible,Â” said Information Systems Technician (IT) 1st Class Timothy Hess, a local area network administrator from USS Fort McHenry (LSD 43). Hess, along with ITs from Logistics Group Western Pacific in Singapore, embarked with the U.S. staff to set up and operate the CENTRIX and PAC3T systems. PAC3T includes a monitor display with maps that allows for the visual tracking of assets, such as ships.<br><br>When issues arose with CENTRIX or PAC3T, the ITs, along with their RSN counterparts were able to find solutions together.<br><br>Â“We were able to troubleshoot issues as a team. It was an excellent training opportunity to let them get on CENTRIX so they could see the advantages of having real-time chat with other navies for tracking and plotting,Â” Hess added.<br><br>During the underway phase of the exercise, the combined task group took part in a variety of operational events, including a missile exercise against a surface target by the RSN, and a combined gun and missile shoot against an air target, simulated by a BQM-74E drone launched from USS McCampbell (DDG 85). Other at-sea events included air defense, close air support, surface action group and tactical free play exercises.<br><br>While cutting-edge technologies and operations were the focal point for U.S. and Singaporean combined operations, it was the personal interactions, teamwork and exposure to operational and cultural differences that left the greatest impression on U.S. Sailors.<br><br>Â“A lot of the concepts onboard the Resolution were really radical at least from our perspective," Hess said. Â“For instance when you went to the mess decks, you served yourself. When you were finished you washed your own plates and put them back in the cabinet you pulled them from. That meant not a lot of wasted food and they didnÂ’t have to have food service attendants because they policed themselves.Â”<br><br>With only 65 officers and crew aboard the largest class of ship in the Republic of Singapore Navy, the camaraderie and pride was evident in the crew's attitudes.<br><br>Â“There was a lot of camaraderie between the crew and the commanding officer. It seemed as if the commanding officer only had to breathe an idea and the crew was on it,Â” said Operations Specialist 1st Class Andrew Craft.<br><br>Craft embarked Resolution from Fort McHenry and added that it seemed the U.S. contingent built camaraderie with their counterparts. Â“They were really eager to help us out and work alongside,Â” he said.<br><br>The Singaporean navy counterparts agreed that the joint command exercise was a success on a personal and professional level.<br><br>Â“This has been an incredible exercise and experience,Â” said Col. Sim Tiong Kian. Â“There was very close cooperation between the ships of both navies in the planning phase ashore and execution at sea, as well as amongst members of the joint afloat Exercise Planning and Control Team in managing the battle rhythm. Through extensive interaction between exercise participants at the professional and social level of interoperability and mutual understanding was achieved, which puts both navies in good stead for further collaboration in future exercises and operations.Â”<br><br>The CARAT Task Group, under the leadership of Commodore Little, is made up of the U.S. Coast Guard high endurance cutter Mellon (WHEC 717), the dock landing ship USS Fort McHenry (LSD 43), the guided missile destroyers USS Russell (DDG 59) and USS McCampbell (DDG 85), and the rescue and salvage ship USS Salvor (ARS 52).<br><br>CARAT is a regularly scheduled series of bilateral military training exercises with several Southeast Asia nations designed to enhance interoperability of the respective sea services.<br><br>-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br><br><strong> Why is it not a constant link for RSN? </strong><br><br>What sort of radio link was RSN using? Satcom or VHF/MF/HF? They are using a LEO satellite?!! Or just trying to safe cost?<br><br>Any comments?</div>
