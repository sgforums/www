            <div class='col-md body'>I don't know if i am mistaken, but i think i read somewhere that kevlar vests have limited life-spans due to UV affecting the material or some stuff like that. It would be good if someone familiar with this could say something about this. Vests have different grades of protection, and kevlar vests alone probably provide only protection up to knives and pistol bullets (i could be wrong, again). Even then, i understand that the possibility of sustaining internal injuries is quite high due to deformation of the kevlar to absorb the energy of the round.<br><br>As such, i believe that plates provide better protection in the military context where the speed of the projectiles are a lot faster. unfortunately, weight is a price u have to pay. So, the answer is to develop lighter plates. I think that's easier said than done, tho!</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by dragonstar:</div><div class="quote_body">If memory serves me right, the bullets penetrated at the EDGE of the vest - and the manufacturer claims that the fact that the vest is vulnerable there is properly documented.</div></blockquote>Well, according to reports released, the Vest had suffered from at least 20-35% Ballistic Degradation since first use. The Policeman who suffered a fatal injury had only worn his Vest for 8 months, supposedly a Brand new one as well.<br><br>It seems a bit specious of a claim to say that the EDGE Hit is the reason for the penetration. I believe that the Ballistic Degradation had much more to do with that.<br><br>And it wasn't some Low-Grade Kevlar too. It was Zylon, one of the newest Man-made fibres. When it is brand-new, it can stop High-Velocity 9mm rounds with nary a problem. And it is amazingly light and thin...  However, its very vulnerable to UV and Water if i'm correct.<br><br>The nasty thing is that many Law Enforcement Agencies in US are now stuck with Brand new stocks of Zylon Armour... and their Suppliers are asking them to buy new upgrade packs. Why should the Customer pay extra for something that was supposed to work in the first place?</div>
