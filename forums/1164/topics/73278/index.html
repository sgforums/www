Its basically a vest with 2 pockets front and back, though i remember only got 1 pocket in front.  In the pocket, you put a big thick heavy metal plate.  Instructions on the plate says its level good against protection from shrapnel, not projectiles such as bullets.  Hope this helps.</div>

Reason being that one can always find a round that is capable of penetrating the Armour...<br><br>While a WWII Flak Jacket, weighing 14kgs, can only stop low-level Handgun threats. Newer Man-made Fibres, like Kevlar Vest are capable of stopping Higher-Level 9mm Handgun Threats at 4-5kgs.<br><br>To stop Rifle rounds, you would require Ceramic Plates or Steel ones, depending on what is the calibre and type of round you expect to encounter. They tend to weigh 2-3 kg per piece. 2 pieces, 1 Front &amp; 1 Back, means an additional 4-6 kg...<br><br>To stop Fragments, you would hardly require Plates. Soft Kevlar is typically capable of those.<br><br>Since the fugitives were described as possessing handguns, going in with Plates would be a bit of an overkill... not to mention very uncomfortable...<br><br>Not too sure if anyone is interested, there has been quite an uproar in US while i was there. Apparently, a couple of Policemen were injured and even killed even with the use of Armour. It seems that there were some unscrupulous Manufacturers that had not tested their vests sufficiently prior to sale.<br><br>I sure hope i do not see our Police or SAF using that Manufacturer's Products... or even me end up wearing one of those...</div>
