            <div class='col-md body'>DATE:05/11/07<br>SOURCE:Flight International<br>Typhoon deal brings boost for Saudi firms<br>By Craig Hoyle<br><br>Saudi Arabian companies will have a strong presence at this yearÂ’s Dubai air show, reflecting the nationÂ’s high spending power among the six Gulf Cooperation Council states, and its multi-billion dollar air force procurement and modernisation efforts.<br><br>Supported by Western aerospace manufacturers including BAE Systems, Boeing, General Electric and Pratt &amp; Whitney, RiyadhÂ’s fledgling defence industry has over the past two decades developed to a point where it will soon advance from providing maintenance and support services on multiple aircraft types to performing final assembly work on 48 of the Royal Saudi Air ForceÂ’s future 72 Eurofighter Typhoons.<br><br>Signed with the UK government in late September, Saudi ArabiaÂ’s initially Â£4.4 billion ($9 billion) deal will start with the delivery of 24 Eurofighters already on order for the Royal Air Force under the programmeÂ’s Tranche 2 production deal with Germany, Italy, Spain and the UK. The aircraft will replace 24 Panavia Tornado air defence fighters, and some Northrop F-5s.<br><br>Final details of the government-to-government deal Â– such as where the Saudi-completed aircraft will be produced Â– have yet to be confirmed, although progress was expected during the state visit to the UK of King Abdullah bin Abdul Aziz al Saud from 30 October until 1 November. But with the massive deal secured, the four-nation Eurofighter consortium has opted against having a formal presence at the Dubai show, with BAE to instead promote the Typhoon using a full-scale model.<br><br>Local Typhoon completions will further extend a process referred to by BAE as Â“Saudi-isationÂ”. This has already seen the nationÂ’s industry Â– including Dubai exhibitors Advanced Electronics and Alsalam Aircraft Â– gain experience in performing the first phase of a wide-ranging Capability Sustainment Programme upgrade to the RSAFÂ’s Tornado interdictor strike aircraft.<br><br>Eight of the modified aircraft, which will eventually feature improved cockpit avionics, navigation systems, targeting equipment and new precision-guided weapons, visited the UK from August for exercise Â“Saudi Green FlagÂ” alongside the RAFÂ’s Tornado GR4-equipped 617 Sqn.<br><br>The introduction of similar skills across Saudi industry has also come through BoeingÂ’s 50% holding in Alsalam, which has led to the company securing major contracts to provide technical support and depot maintenance work on the air forceÂ’s Tornados, Boeing F-15 fighters and KE-3 Airborne Warning and Control System aircraft. The company also holds contracts on the RSAFÂ’s Lockheed Martin C-130 transports, Gulfstream and Bombardier Learjet-series business jets and helicopters including the Agusta-Bell 212/412, Boeing AH-64A Apache and Sikorsky UH-60.<br><br>Another major Saudi modernisation effort under way will see its air forceÂ’s 70 F-15S fighters undergo a propulsion system upgrade, with their P&amp;W<br>F100-229 engines Â– the source of a long-term Â“sustainment problemÂ” Â– to be replaced by GE F110-129Cs. GE has a contract worth more than $300 million to produce the first 65 of an expected 155 engines for the F-15S fleet.<br><br>Other Saudi exhibitors will include the national and regional arms of UK defence contractor BAE Systems, business aviation company Jet Aviation, fractional operator NetJets, and VIP air transport provider National Air Services.<br><br><a href="http://www.flightglobal.com/articles/2007/11/05/219183/typhoon-deal-brings-boost-for-saudi-firms.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.flightglobal.com/articles/2007/11/05/219183/typhoon-deal-brings-boost-for-saudi-firms.html</a></div>

Test pilots are on hand to demonstrate and explain the aircraftÂ’s intuitive Man-Machine Interface, which many believe is the TyphoonÂ’s key advantage over many of its competitors.<br><br><img src="http://www.flightglobal.com/assets/getAsset.aspx?ItemID=20279"><br><br>Eurofighter GmbHÂ’s absence looks surprising, especially after Saudi Arabia finally signed a $8.86 billion contract for the purchase of 72 Eurofighter Typhoons on September 11. But this deal was a direct government-to-government arrangement between the UK and Saudi Arabia, and not between the manufacturer and the customer.<br><br>The Typhoon procurement was originally outlined in the December 2005 al-Salam agreement between the two governments.<br><br>This Â‘Understanding DocumentÂ’ confirmed Saudi ArabiaÂ’s intention to procure Typhoon aircraft to replace some RSAF Tornados and other frontline aircraft. No details were released at the time, though press reports suggested the deal would be 72 Typhoons, and that al-Salam would follow the long-running al-Yamamah programme. This was signed in 1984 and covered the supply of Hawks and Tornados, generating more than Â£43bn of revenue for BAE Systems.<br><br>The initial contract will be followed by further deals covering the supply of weapons, support, training and engineering services, and some have estimated that these will eventually total $40bn over the lifetime of the aircraft.<br><br>The first 24 Saudi Typhoons will be built by BAE Systems at Warton, north-west England, with the remaining 48 aircraft probably being assembled locally in Saudi Arabia, though details remain to be finalised. It was initially thought that the Saudi aircraft would take 12 RAF line positions, not 24 as widely reported, at the beginning of Tranche 2, and another 12 extra line positions will be added later in Tranche 2.<br><br>This initial batch of 24 Saudi aircraft will include six two-seaters. It was widely expected that the first 12 Saudi aircraft would be interspersed with RAF aircraft on the Warton line, but recent reports suggest that these Saudi aircraft will now be delivered as a Â‘blockÂ’, leading to a delay in RAF deliveries, though extra RAF aircraft will be added at the end of Tranche 2, so there will be no change to RAF numbers. As a result, the RAFÂ’s third frontline Typhoon unit, No.6 Squadron, is not expected to stand up until 2010.<br><br>The first 22 Saudi Typhoon pilots and an initial cadre of engineers will be trained alongside their Royal Air Force counterparts at RAF Coningsby on the Typhoon Operational Conversion Unit, No.29 (Reserve) Squadron. The remaining 48 aircraft (including eight two-seaters) will come from Tranche 3, or will be locally assembled at a Â“new facility in Saudi ArabiaÂ”.<br><br>These 72 Typhoons will replace the RSAFÂ’s Tornado ADV fighters, and some Northrop F-5s and Boeing F-15Cs, and there may even be an eventual requirement for up to 200 aircraft.<br><br>BAE is a long-standing supplier of defence equipment to Saudi Arabia, starting with Hawker Hunters and then BAC Strikemasters and Lightnings, and later BAE Hawks and Panavia Tornados. The company has a stated strategy of continuing Â“to develop Saudi Arabia as a key home market.Â” The Typhoon sale also reflects increasing co-operation between the UK and Saudi Ministries of Defence, which has included two recent bilateral exercises involving the RAF and RSAF Tornado forces.<br><br>With the Saudi contract signed, a number of other export campaigns are being actively pursued. In the period immediately before the Dubai show, Eurofighter GmbH completed a pre-bid RFP clarification process in India. Â“This was the most professionally put together and most comprehensive RFP IÂ’d ever seen, but we are happy with the detail, and happy that we understand what they want, and we are putting together a compliant bid,Â”according to one senior Eurofighter source.<br><br>Â“Operationally, Typhoon is exactly what the Indian Air Force needs, and I am confident that it will meet their technology transfer and industrial aspirations. The Indians themselves are stressing costs of ownership, so I think that our combination of capability and low lifecycle costs over 40 years will be compelling.Â”<br><br>Eurofighter GmbH is also actively participating in the JASDFÂ’s F-X F-4 replacement programme in Japan, where an RFP is said to be imminent.<br><br>Typhoon was actually selected as GreeceÂ’s new generation fighter in March 2000, and the Greek Government announced its commitment to an order for 60 Typhoons later that year. Contract signature was then delayed due to the cost of the 2004 Olympic Games, however, and the fighter competition was re-opened by a new incoming Government. Eurofighter GmbH has continued to try to find alternative funding arrangements and to resolve budget issues, and Greece has been offered substantial industrial participation in the Eurofighter progamme.<br><br>Switzerland is also viewed as an interesting prospect for the Typhoon, especially after AustriaÂ’s selection of the type.<br>A number of European JSF partner nations are also being courted as potential Typhoon customers. Though Norway is a Â‘Level TwoÂ’ JSF partner, the country has been a member of the Eurofighter industrial partnership since January 2003, when it made an initial Â€10.8m investment to participate in high technology development work, later increasing its industrial participation to Â€23m in June 2005.<br><br>A number of other nations have expressed serious reservations about industrial participation in the Lockheed Martin F-35 Lightning II Joint Strike Fighter programme, or about timescales, and are now viewed as Typhoon prospects. These nations include Denmark, the Netherlands and Turkey.<br><br>There have even been suggestions that there may still be the possibility of Â‘follow-onÂ’ requirements in Singapore and South Korea, where the Typhoon lost out to the Boeing F-15 Eagle in earlier fighter competitions.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Regarding the Â“ middle optionÂ”, no matter how good is the EJ200 powerplant, it still is not the big thrust turbofan engine like YanksÂ’ F119/F135 or RussianÂ’s F117 series currently under development.  2 EJ200 powered current TyphoonÂ’s super cruise &amp; super maneuverability are no match of F-22. if Europeans really go for the internal bay &amp; applying thick RAM coating, it will dramatically increase the Â“middle optionÂ” EF2000Â’s die weight, which in turn will further lower the EF2000Â’s  T/W ratio thus jeopardize  its super cruise &amp; super maneuverability.

This engine would use the improved Step A core with a larger fan and low-pressure turbine. It would still fit within the existing F/A-18E/F engine installation, however. The final growth step - Step C - would produce an engine with 30 percent more thrust than the F414 - just under 29,000 pounds force (130 kN). This thrust level is nearly equal to the F110 Increased Performance Engine. To reach this impressive thrust level will demand further airflow growth from the fan, a modest temperature increase, a new two-stage low pressure turbine and a new afterburner."<br><br>Of course, the EJ200 can be further developed if only money and time is available.<br><br>Cheers,<br>Sunho<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I agree that having one more aircraft platform might be worth the cost and other disadvantages of having too many platforms. I was worried when USAF grounded all F-15's last month due to possible catastrophic airframe failure. Fortunately for us, the grounding has since been narrowed down to just the F-15C, which is different from ours.<br>Anyone know the actual reason our RSAF rejected the Typhoon? I recall it was because certain requirements were not met and RSAF rejected it soon after it was down to three (Rafale, F-15 and Typhoon).<br>Rafale still hasn't made any foreign sale - will RSAF take a risk on buying it?<br>Yep, with oil nearly $100/barrel and threat of nukes from Iran,  Saudis have the cash and will to buy top-of-the-line planes. I read in Flight mag that their Tornadoes and Typhoons may be be equipped with MBDAÂ’s Storm Shadow cruise missile.<br>Aside from the Saudis, the UAE has 80 F-16E/F Block 60 and 436 Leclerc MBTs.</div>
