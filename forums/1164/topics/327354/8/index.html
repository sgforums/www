              </blockquote>
              <p>I think your comprehension still fail leh, also you don't practice what you preach... you meant this post to be just for me right? So how come you are not "only send an email to me in private".</p>
              <p>Sorry sir, your logic no link. Maybe in army your men will listen to you without questioning too much, but here we all ORD liao...</p>
              <p>Why post private to lionnoisy when he obviously means for people to respond him in public? Do you want to try responding to him rationally.</p>
              <p>The replies to lionnoisy are meant to be wrong and ungair, they are made in his logic to begin with. I have no issues with people pointing out they are wrong or unfair as a matter of fact, except that I find it rather amusing that they seem to miss the big picture when they think these are supposed to be taken seriously by anyone other then lionnoisy.</p>
              <p>As I said, you're like a guy who goes to watch Tropic Thunder and then critique it as if it was supposed to be Black Hawk Down.</p>
              <p>That said, it is pretty much the agreement in here that such responses to lionnoisy add much humour and entertainment to the forum and hence they will be carried out regardless of your inability to percieve anything thing beyond the literal in here... which is frankly your loss.</p>
              <p>Nuff said.</p>
