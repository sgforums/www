              <p>it seem like the person who does not learn is you !!!</p>
              <p>Don't understand you, we getting body armour now - you complain
                  that should have got it sooner !!! If we got BA sooner - eariler
                  verison one - now you be complaining it is now outdated, why we
                  cannot get the better type in market now !!! Hello you complaining
                  like Ah Ma !!!!</p>
              <p>Buy earlier - you complain now outdated, buy later you also
                  complain should have got earlier !!! You complain for the joy of
                  complaining</p>
              <p>Did any war broke out that we have to fight with BA ? Did any
                  soldier died shot - that could have been saved by a BA ? - Answer
                  is no, this clearly proven the decision to buy BA now is the
                  correct and wise choice, to hold back till better BA is available,
                  and when the regions is more unstable which is now which we have
                  more likely to use it. Getting the equipment - when we best and
                  most need it is the better investment and not getting it just
                  because - it is out in the market, there will alway be newer and
                  better stuff all the time, you just cannot be blindly chasing after
                  it</p>

              <p>eh ?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>i m missing your point. dont get your point</p>
              <p>SGTY is saying, BA is good, should have gotten earlier. and you are saying he's complaining NO BA = bad, got BA = bad. wth ? dont get it.</p>
              <p>define "new and better" BA. if i m not mistaken. SAF body armour requirement is a class IIIA body armour. capable of stopping 7.62mm round from 50m away. its the same requirements as the current ones we have. dragonskin is a class5 body armour i think. SAF dosent always stay at the top of the tech curve.</p>
              <p>simple reason, equipping thousands of conscripts each year, upkeep and maintainence of BA is troublesome. with our hot and humid weather, fungus will be a big trouble. ceramite plates will occasionally shatter and break in training as well. all these cost money le. maybe thats why  we are only procuring it now with a 10 billion annual budget.</p>

              <p>are u still remember this?</p>
              <p>When a navy ship cannot perform functions of military tasks,</p>
              <p>what do u think?</p>
              <p>The Tenix Australia proposed this commercial ship platform to New</p>
              <p>Zealand Navy as a military transport ship,but</p>
              <blockquote>
              <p>Canterbury’s design is based on a commercial “roll-on, roll-off” ship,
                  <span style="color: #ff0000;"><em>Ben-My-Chree</em></span> in operation in the Irish Sea.Roll-on, roll-off ships
                  carry wheeled cargo using built-in ramps allowing the cargo to be
                  "rolled on" and "rolled off" the vessel.</p>
              </blockquote>
              <p>The Ben-My-Chree is designed operating near coastal waters.</p>
              <p>But NZ Navy need a platform operates in ocean!</p>
              <p>This causes the first in class ship  operates 40% of the time!!</p>
              <p>Not to mention one of the Fast Ctaft was wiped out in rough sea.</p>
              <p>I am always accused underestimating Oz naval ships designs and buildings.</p>
              <p>No need to argue.Just read how NZ navy cope with using this civilian</p>
              <p>use ships as military use!!</p>
              <p>I salute to drivers who drive vehicle from the deck of HMNZ Canterbury</p>
              <p>via the aft ramp to the Landing craft on rough sea.</p>
              <p>FYI.It is advised that the aft ramp cannot be used above Sea State</p>

              troubles have kept the Navy's newest ship alongside for 65 of the 160

              <p><strong>The navy's problem-plagued new ship, HMNZS Canterbury, lost

              <p>where sheeps are &gt; than humans.what do you seriouslly need aircraft for ? bomb the attacking penguins ? repel penguin invasion ? fight the whales ?</p>
              <p>its a major hole in the defence. no contest. absolutely right. but when u need to project force into NZ. its so far away that anyone's supply chain would probably be overstretched. with the exception of australia.</p>
              <p>and i doubt australia will be mounting any mission of conquest anytime soon.</p>
              <p>there's no viable threat to new zealand at the moment, and its unlikely to be a very sought after territory or of any strategic value even in the event of a war.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>i know too little about the state of new zealand naval / maritime forces so i m not going to comment. all i can say is. new zealand is a pretty nice place. i love christchurch and i think they ought to spend some serious thought on how to defend it properly.</p>

                  <p> </p>
                  <p>i m missing your point. dont get your point</p>
                  <p>SGTY is saying, BA is good, should have gotten earlier. and you
                  are saying he's complaining NO BA = bad, got BA = bad. wth ? dont
                  get it.</p>
                  <p>define "new and better" BA. if i m not mistaken. SAF body armour
                  requirement is a class IIIA body armour. capable of stopping 7.62mm
                  round from 50m away. its the same requirements as the current ones
                  we have. dragonskin is a class5 body armour i think. SAF dosent
                  always stay at the top of the tech curve.</p>
                  <p>simple reason, equipping thousands of conscripts each year,
                  upkeep and maintainence of BA is troublesome. with our hot and
                  humid weather, fungus will be a big trouble. ceramite plates will
                  occasionally shatter and break in training as well. all these cost
                  money le. maybe thats why  we are only procuring it now with a
                  10 billion annual budget.</p>
                                </div>
                              </blockquote><br>
                  
                  <p>First let correct you since you are basically arguing with the wrong information. So far in the world Body Armour classification - is I, II , IIIA, III &amp; IV only .... I am not sure how you get mislead to think that Dragon skin is class V ? </p>
                  
                  <p>As for you so call dragon skin ? The armor is available in two basic protection levels: SOV-2000, which was certified as Level III protection (this certification was withdrawn, and Pinnacle is suing to force the NIJ to reinstate on the basis of its own private retesting[2][3]) and SOV-3000, which is advertised as Level IV but has not yet been certified as such.[3] Pinnacle Armor's website also identifies a "Level V" variant, which does not correspond to any body armor standard and is not available to the general public .</p>
                  
                  <p> Hello III level certification withdrawn ? level IV not certified , then so call level V - does not correspond to and body armour standard ? - a lot of questionable on how effective dragon skin is ? </p>  
                  
                  <p>Dragon Skin is good - that is as far as the company keep telling everyone. If it is that great every military will be running to get it, if not frankly there is alternative in the market. Just because we not jumping to get dragon skin - does not mean we getting anything inferior. </p>
                  
                  <p> We also must get a balance of armour protection and mobility of the soldier ! Of course higher level IV is better in protection but make the soldier less mobile. </p>
              
              <p>As for SGTY is saying, BA is good, should have gotten earlier ? That i already answer in my eariler post - i disagree and i think the timing is just right. Just because you and T-rex cannot accept other people view and blindly just follow manufactorer claims !!! </p>

              <p>Actually, such a vicious criminal calls for much more than even the Singapore criminal system - call in the ski-jump carriers to project power with their men on roller skates!</p>
              <p>As for "dream country for migrations", yup, keep dreaming - you know you'll never pass a migration test.  Hell, count yourself damned lucky that you don't need a test to be a Singaporean - the rest of you would end up as displaced as the bullshit you spew. <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Cartoon/teeth.png" alt="teeth.png"></p>
              <p>Come to think of it, your parents must be relieved that Section 377 was repealed last year - at least your existence doesn't mean prison for them anymore. <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Cartoon/teeth.png" alt="teeth.png"></p>
