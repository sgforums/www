              <p>Oz try to create jobs for local.So they emphasis as much as possible</p>
              <p>works to be done in Oz!!</p>
              <p>But is the Spanish shipyard good to produce warships?</p>
              <p>i find the main contract was signed before the sub systems</p>
              <p>are finalised.Will this increase the price?</p>
              <p>U know shipyard will charge u any single bolt and nut and one more</p>
              <p>hole they drill.</p>
              <p>I find A$8 b for 3 AWD is pretty expensive.</p>
              <p>How much a USN destoryer cost?</p>

              <p>6 months before Howard governemnt stepped down in early Dec 2007,or</p>
              <p>5 months before the General Election in Nov 2007!!</p>
              <p>The A$3 billion Super Hornets contract was also signed in May 2007!!</p>
              <p>Why suddenly Oz find the urge to buy hard wares of A$14 billions within</p>

              <p>Wow!!A$8 billion for 3 AWD.</p>
              <p>But i am still feel uncomfortable that contracts have been awarded</p>
              <p>when AWD.COM have not finalised the design and selections</p>

              <p>Can they incorporate it in a better looking way and more stealth?</p>
              <p>How is the RCS compared with ships built 1 to 2 decades ago?</p>
              <p>Pl bear with me of this kind of layman comments.</p>

              <h2>There are some improvements ,of course.</h2>
              <p>But can they do better,ie more stealth,less RCS.</p>
              <p>This is 2008.</p>
              <p>U look at the model.They dunt bother conceal the small craft.</p>
              <p>Is it worth A$2,500,000,000 for one ship?</p>

              <p>Since when was the Aelgis system, with all it's powerful active radars and the like, as well as operating near other fleet ships which will show up on radar and the like, supposed to be a stealth system?</p>
              <p> Only a noisy lion don't know any homework will even bother to ask these questions.</p>
              <p>He might as well ask, we spent a ton of cash on the F-15SG, but it has such a huge RCS compared to the JSF or even the F-16, as well as having a much larger logistics footprint.</p>
              <p>So going by lionnoisy's logic the RSAF made a bad mistake spending so much money on a old, non-stealthy aircraft design that is several decades old when fifth generation stuff is already here.</p>

              Even if the Aust AWD is to operate miles away from any other ships alone. With its better radar, it will detect enemy 1st can can choose to evade or even if it cannot evade - its equipments and weapons - are able to take on any threats alone. 
              
              Also when you get to a certain size - no matter how you wish apply stealth - you just too a little too huge to be effective, so may not be worth that little effort to just reduce it by a little percentage, but stick to proven design which give advantage in other areas.

              <p>If it ever come to war - the whole Oz fleet, troops ships and merchant fleet will be deploy !! Also most likely they will be part of a combine commonwealth fleet or Nato Fleet.</p>
                      
                  
              <p>Even in exercise -they been doing that with US and other navies including singapore navy.</p>
                  
                      
              <p>3 AWD delivered - cannot cover backside ?  If position them at properly on the outer defence parameter of the fleet - they form a nice triangle defence, which is effective enough to cover everything.  Even with 1 ADW in the fleet - your anti-air, anti-ship and anti-submarine will be increased !</p>
                  
                      
              <p>The ADWs is able to handle air, surface and underwater threat, they do not need escorts.</p>

              <p>Don't avoid the question lionnoisy.</p>
              <p>You reduce RCS but use a very powerful active radar and have to use it as part of your role what's the point? Even if you are totally invisible to radar your enemy can still pick you up. Even the low RCS of our Formidible class becomes useless the moment it starts operating in active mode.</p>
              <p>So you are not answering the question, you are only showing that you don't really know much about the subject in matter.</p>
              <p>You talk so much about christmas tree for what? Go read up more on stuff instead of copy-and-pasting.</p>
              <p>The Aelgis ship is supposed to protect fleet operations, unless each and every single ship in the fleet is stealthed, there is no point for the AWD to do the same thing, given the ships it escorts have a much bigger RCS then it in the first place.</p>
              <p>Stealth is not the only thing in naval warfare, there are plenty of other factors. It that was the case you might as well say all ships in the navy ought to be submarines because they are the ultimate expression of stealth.</p>
              <p>If stealth was the ultimate aim of naval warfare, then ships would long have looked like the Sea Shadow.</p>
              <p>So what are you trying to say? Except that you don't know very much but want to make a lot of noise?</p>
