              <p>Seriously lionnoisy, get educated and don't get confused over singular statements like LCS modules and now you can't even make a mental crawl to get over what a mockup means?</p>
              <p>Mockup:</p>
              <p>In common usage, a <strong>mockup</strong> is a <a title="Scale model" href="http://sgforums.com/wiki/Scale_model"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0066cc;">scale model</span></span></a> of a structure or device, usually used for teaching, demonstration, testing a design, etc.</p>
              <p>A mockup should not be confused with a <a title="Prototype" href="http://sgforums.com/wiki/Prototype"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0066cc;">prototype</span></span></a>. Prototypes are always meant to function, even if not fully so, whereas mock-ups are only meant to look like the real system, and do not function. The two are easy to confuse in <a title="Software engineering" href="http://sgforums.com/wiki/Software_engineering"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0066cc;">software</span></span></a> and <a title="Systems engineering" href="http://sgforums.com/wiki/Systems_engineering"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0066cc;">systems engineering</span></span></a> especially, <strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">where mockups are a way of <em>prototyping</em> </span></strong><a class="mw-redirect" title="User interfaces" href="http://sgforums.com/wiki/User_interfaces"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">user interfaces</span></strong></span></a><strong><span style="color: #ff0000;"> on paper or computer images. In many cases it is best to design the user interface before </span></strong><a title="Source code" href="http://sgforums.com/wiki/Source_code"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">code</span></strong></span></a><strong><span style="color: #ff0000;"> is written or </span></strong><a title="Machine" href="http://sgforums.com/wiki/Machine"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">hardware</span></strong></span></a><strong><span style="color: #ff0000;"> is built, to avoid having to go back and make expensive changes.</span></strong></p>
              <p><span class="mw-headline"><strong>Other uses</strong></span></p>
              <p>Mockups are also used in the Consumer goods industry, as part of the product development process, when the size, <a title="Impression" href="http://sgforums.com/wiki/Impression"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0066cc;">impression</span></span></a> and/or <a title="Visual arts" href="http://sgforums.com/wiki/Visual_arts"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0066cc;">artworks</span></span></a> have to be <a title="Marketing research" href="http://sgforums.com/wiki/Marketing_research"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0066cc;">tested</span></span></a> and approved.</p>
              <p>Mockup is also a frequently used term when talking about an early layout or sketch of a Web site or GUI program.</p>

              <p><br>Erm because he needs to feel good about the RSN and the only way by doing that is to be wilfully ignorant and ask truly silly questions like if the they are going to use the mockup as a blueprint.</p>
              <p>His lame attempt to ask questions about the mockup being the blueprint for things was pretty funny. The duh factor on that thing is so astounding that even the "laymen" that lionnoisy claims to be can't possibly mess it up.</p>

              <p>The Hobart class is really a destroyer and not a frigate. They will be slightly larger than the Spanish F100 due to evolving design.  Euro countries like to call their destroyers frigates as it sounds more 'peaceful'.</p>
              <p>The $8billion cost also includes extras like support and training as well, and not just ship building cost. It is expensive, but for this price you're getting the most advanced ship in SE Asia. China doesn't have one like it, only Korea and Japan will have anything similar.</p>
              <p>So to the dumbass lionnoisy, grow up.</p>
              <p>On a side note, it is possible and likely that Australia will be getting EA18G growlers to complement their purchase of SHs. I was disappointed with the SH purchase due to doubts about their speed, but now I see what the logic is. The Growlers will multiply the ability of the SH by many fold.</p>

              <p>Yes it is a bold move by Australia, but if you want to develop new capabilities, then of course it has to be. One could argue that it is a bold move by SG to develop a submarine capability based on so little experience, however it's a move that has to be done.</p>

              <p>You obviously have no idea on the true state of our submarine force. Do you have any idea on the readiness our our current submarine force? No idea? Try talking to somebody into the RSN.</p>
              <p>Curiously for anything regarding the SAF, you always seem to assume 100 percent readiness for anything, but is incredibly pessimistic when it comes to any other nation. Apparently, murphy laws only works for other nations?</p>
              <p>In any case for your "layman" understanding, lets just say that in terms of submarine technology, the Aussies are light years ahead of us, or any nation in the world for that matter when it comes to operating blue water SSKs.</p>
              <p>So when Australia get second hand weapons system it is a mistake?</p>
              <p>But when Singapore gets an old, second hand sub that was supposed to be scrapped it is "for our needs".</p>

              <p>Your "not more than half can sail in any one time" submarine managed to wreck havoc with the USN to the point the Americans decided to trade their advanced submarine technology with the Aussies for experience in SSK warfare.</p>
              <p>You keep harping on problems, while the Aussies go on ahead with Virgina SSN technology and ADCAP torpedos, and are already planning a new class of SSK from the lessons they learnt with the Collins.</p>
              <p>What does ST marine have to show after all these years except a few refurbished submarines that are endurance limited, dumb, deaf and blind compared to the collins?</p>
              <p>So apparently "our needs" for submarines mean this standard? Is this the same excuse that had us operating outdated light tanks for over 30 years?  </p>

              <p>Yes it is a bold move by Australia, but if you want to develop new capabilities, then of course it has to be. One could argue that it is a bold move by SG to develop a submarine capability based on so little experience, however it's a move that has to be done.</p>

              <p>The problem about any military programme that the SAF develops is that you only hear the good news in the media, but the actual picture of things is very different.</p>
              <p>Unfortunately for lionnoisy, there are plenty of issues with our procurement projects, reference customer or not. We spent millions mucking around with our AMX13 replacement, trying weird stuff like Bionix MGS before deciding to just get Leo2A4s and refurbish them.</p>
              <p>So what happened to all the time, money and effort spent on our AMX13 replacement project over 20 years?</p>
              <p>Flushed down the toliet.</p>
              <p>In any other country, this would have been a big scandal and media disaster, but for some reason we never hear of it, quietly forgotten.</p>
              <p>How come lionnoisy isn't saying much about the fact that despite 10 years since it was introduced, the SAF has still not fully introduced the SAR-21 to all the troops and even frontline units find themselves using a mix of M-16 for M203 and SAR-21 and realizing that in battle the M203 gunner is unable to share ammunition with the rest of his section?</p>
              <p>To add salt to the wound, we see ST selling better versions of the SAR-21 to other nations while our own soldiers use a basic version that can't even fight at night without relying excessively on the LAD.</p>
              <p>In any case I do not see why lionnoisy wants to cry so much about stealth in Australia's context, JORN can easily find our Formidibles, there isn't anything of multi-thousand tonnage on the surface of the water that isn't supposed to be there the Aussies can't find.</p>
