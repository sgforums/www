              <p>The US would be able to build One Nuclear Submarine per shipyard.</p>

              <p><strong>Targeting Nuclear Submarines </strong></p>
              <p>Why, then, is the future of a vibrant and busier-than-ever submarine force, supported by efficiently produced and operationally capable platforms of the Virginia class, threatened by stretched-out production schedules and a weakened industrial base? The reason, as is so often the case, is money—and short-range solutions to near-term fiscal shortfalls are now seriously undermining the nation's long-term capability to build and sustain a dominant undersea force. U.S. submarine roles and missions, alternative force levels, and the various options on how to reach and maintain them were the focus of a recent Congressional Research Service report. <a name="ref2"></a><a href="/forums/1164/topics/#n2"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0000f0;">2 </span></span></a>In that study, the present method—where the General Dynamics Electric Boat shipyard in Groton and the Northrop Grumman Newport News shipyard co-produce Virginia hulls then alternate final assembly, test, and delivery—was compared to alternate schemes. <strong>The present arrangement was deemed optimum for what was to be initially a one ship per year buy, but planned to increase to two ships per year (one for each yard) construction rate as early as 2002. </strong></p>

              The Collins Class Submarines are an engineering marvel, but have not been without their problems, which included:<br> <br> Design
              faults: The metal that had been selected for use in the propeller had
              not been thoroughly tested and was brittle and inadequate.<br> <br> Sound
              signature faults: The vessel's sound signature was not correct and
              could not adequately avoid detection (it was a noisy sub).<br> <br> Water
              ingress problems: Initially the Collins Class had water ingress in
              excess of 300 litres per hour, flooding into the sub. This was
              eventually corrected to only 3 litres.<br> <br> Most of the problems the
              Collins Class faced were the result of the fact that the vessel was
              different to anything else that the engineers had tried to achieve

              <blockquote>
              <p>Australian Minister for Defence John Moore and Sen. Nick Minchin,
              the Minister for Industry, Science, and Resources, have announced a
              decision to modify two more Collins-class diesel-electric submarines
              (SSKs) and to approve other submarine-related work, at a total cost of
              $72 million.</p>
              
              <p>The
              two submarines, HMAS Farncomb and <span style="color: #ff0000;">the as-yet unlaunched Rankin, sixth
              and last of the class</span>, will be upgraded with the same modifications
              approved last year for HMAS Dechaineux and HMAS Sheean. Changes to the
              submarines include modified propellers, modified casing sections,
              improved hydraulics components, and reliability improvements to the
              diesel engine system.....</p>

              <p>I don't know why lionnoisy likes to make noise about the Collins class being upgraded, if he really did his homework he would have chosen to keep very quiet about it.</p>
              <p>The Collins are recieving upgrades from the USN which is the same as the suite being used in the ultramodern Virgina class SSNs, this is an incredible leap to the warfighting capabilities of the Collins class which is already amongst the best in SSKs in the world.</p>
              <p>Additionally they are also getting ADCAP torpedos under the deal to add that all, as well as plans to</p>

              <p>You answered your own post with the last paragraph, the fact that the Collins was so innovative and different from anything ever tried before, and the fact that they actually suceeded in building, and troubleshooting the class plus a new one planned goes to show that by any means, the entire project is actually a coup for the Australian Navy, given they now have far more experience in the field then any nation in the region.</p>
              <p>Our own submarine force spends a lot of time docked as well, this is the nature of SSK operations, but apparently you didn't know this before you decided to raise noise in here.</p>

              <p>Submarines (subs) are different from all other naval vessels in that they are the only ship capable of submerging and operating under water. <br><br>Subs can do this by harnessing the property of buoyancy or relative density. This relative density is controlled through the use of ballast tanks, which act as a balance between water and air and keep the sub either submerged or afloat.<br><br><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>The Collins Class Submarines were part of an ambitious plan to take Australia's Navy well into the next century, replacing the Oberon class submarines.

              <p><strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">Collins sub shines in US war game</span></strong></p>
              <p>One of Australia's Collins class submarines has hunted down and "killed" a state-of-the-art United States nuclear submarine in a series of mock attacks during an underwater warfare exercise off Hawaii.</p>
              <p>Officers in the exercise told <em>The Sunday Age</em> HMAS Sheean had held its own during two rigorous weeks of combat trials with the Los Angeles class attack sub, USS Olympia. The subs had swapped roles as hunter and prey and scored roughly equal numbers of hits.</p>
              <p>The role of seeking and destroying an enemy submarine is one of the most difficult faced by Australia's six new Collins class submarines. The success off Hawaii in August has boosted morale dramatically among submarine crews who have had to endure years of hearing their boats condemned as noisy and vulnerable.</p>
              <p>A 1999 report by the then CSIRO chief, Malcolm McIntosh, and former BHP managing director John Prescott said the Collins' combat system should be junked, the vessels were noisy and vulnerable to attack, their engines broke down regularly, a badly shaped hull and fin made too much disturbance when they moved at speed under water, the view from the periscope was blurry, the communications system outdated and the propellers were likely to crack.</p>
              <p><strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">Commander Steve Davies, chief-of-staff in the navy's submarine force, said that during the past three years those problems had been fixed to the point where <span style="text-decoration: underline;">the submarines were able to match the best of the US Navy's giant underwater fleet.</span><br></span></strong>

              <p> </p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>During its mock attacks on the Olympia and on two US destroyers, the Sheean fired 28 torpedoes. Commander Davies said "a respectable percentage" of shots Sheean fired at Olympia were hits that would have destroyed the powerful US vessel.</strong></span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">Commodore Davies, Australia's most experienced Collins commander, said the two vessels were very evenly matched. The submarines also practised landing special forces.</span></p>
              <p>The exercises provided a crucial test for the Australian submarine, which has been as much criticised at home as it has been feted abroad.</p>
              <p>The Olympia, 110 metres long and 12 metres across the beam, is twice the displacement of the Sheean, at 80 metres by eight metres. The Olympia carries up to 120 crew; the Sheean 45. Many of the Americans are engineers caring for their reactor.</p>
              <p>The Collins is powered by diesel and electric motors and its roles include undersea warfare - finding and destroying other submarines - destroying enemy warships and merchant ships, surveillance and intelligence collection, support for special forces and covert transport.</p>
              <p>Commander Davies said the US sub's size was not an advantage: "It just means you make more noise when you go faster."</p>
              <p>He said cooperation with the US submarine force had increased significantly recently. "That has come about because they're interested in the Collins class and in our submarine force generally."</p>
              <p><strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">While the Americans run the world's most powerful submarine arm, they acknowledge that changes in international conditions in the past decade and new priorities have left them with tactics to learn from the small Australian submarine arm.</span></strong></p>
              <p>Commander Davies said Australian submariners were used to operating in shallow water. "<span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>That's one of the things the Americans are looking towards us for experience in.</strong></span></p>
              <p>"Ten years ago their submarine force was chasing Russian submarines around the deep ocean. Now, as with all submarine forces, it's more focused on closer inshore operations, intelligence collection or working with special forces. They're looking to us as a submarine force which has a long experience in that sort of thing."</p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>The six Collins' combat systems are to be upgraded further and they will get more modern torpedoes. Those the Sheean used in its clashes with the Olympia were developed in the 1970s; the Americans used a far more sophisticated generation.</strong></span></p>
              <p>While smaller than the US nuclear boats, the Collins is one of the world's biggest conventional submarines. It was designed to cover long distances and the Sheean easily reached Hawaii without refuelling.</p>

              <p>Your source also said 98% for the 6 Collins Class Submarines. 802 URD out of 817 URD achieved.</p>
