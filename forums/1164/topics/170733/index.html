Easily irritated? more like bo-hiew to me. Maybe tends to go Orchard etc, more often as you tend to go closer to civilian life by mingling in it to relax.

            <div class='col-md body'>nightzip has gotta be the most relaxed person i've ever seen.<br><br>But i believe how you behave outside is a direct antithesis to how to behave in camp.<br><br>And i thought you should be more easily irritated when you're tired? During topo...after walking 12km and your SC tells you guys you're in Holland, don't tell me you won't feel the slightest bit of irritation?<br><br>Lazerlordz-I think i know how you feel. In one of my ex-units where i was the coy armskote 2IC, we had LRI inspection coming up. I and my OIC, who were known throughout the coy to be as thick as thieves, began to have really short fuses with each other. Working from 8am to 12am for almost a week didn't help much. The shit hit the fan when we got a bad grading and our CSM gave us a good dressing down...we began yelling at each other. LOL.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>hmm...normally should not have good rating...even thick as thief only ensures that you have everything there suppose to be there, by the book.<br><br>For armskote, i believe the cleaniness of the weapons are most important. So unless yours is an active unit, where got many men can help to clean the weapons and ensure all weapons good and working, else only got a few armskotes, cannot clean every weapon in time one.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"></div>
