Helipro flies a number of Squirrels.<br><br>Square Trust rescue helicopter pilot Mike Hall, who flies a Squirrel every day, agrees.<br><br>"Running costs per seat are about as good as it gets," he said.<br><br>"It's very reliable and nice to fly. The Squirrel has hydraulic controls - a bit like power steering - and you can do a big day's work without too much fatigue."<br><br>Australia flies Squirrels in a range of military roles.<br><br>The sources say the deal looks good so far. It's understood a team led by helicopter replacement project chief Wing Commander Barry Nelson is in Singapore at the moment going over the helicopters.<br><br>The Sioux and Iroquois machines have been in RNZAF service since the mid-1960s. Not only are they "old" in terms of their flying life, and increasingly hard to maintain, they are old technology.<br><br>The replacement project is based on taking a broad-brush look at Defence's need for helicopter roles.<br><br>The Squirrel would likely be regarded as a modern-role Sioux replacement, adding broad utility and surveillance capabilities to the training role.<br><br>The Squirrel is a French design from the Eurocopter stable. It's a rugged turbine-powered machine able to carry seven people or more than a tonne slung from its load hook.<br><br>It's quite fast in general-purpose helicopter terms, cruising around 220kmh.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Is it our old Ecuriel which were long retired or our Fennecs? Heard that our Fennecs will be placed in storage/retired after the Apaches arrived. So what chopper will be conducting the training role? Sad to see them go.</div>

These joined 123 Sqn that year and took over the basic helicopter training role, with the UH-1Bs retained for advanced training. This continued until 1989, when the UH-1Bs were retired and 123 Sqn Operations Flight was disbanded. The burden of the RSAFÂ’s helicopter training programme then fell on the shoulders of the Ecureuils, and this light and economical helicopter has been responsible for training scores of RSAF helicopter pilots.<br><br>In 1992, the RSAF took delivery of 20 AS 550 Fennecs(10 AS 550A-2 and 10 AS 550C-2). The AS 550C-2, equiped with a roof mounted sight and armed with GIAT 20mm cannon pods, BAe CRV-7 unguided rockets and Hughes HeliTOW anti-tank guided missiles, operate in the armed scout/observation role while the unarmed AS 550A-2 operate in the training role. The arrival of the new helicopters saw the reorgnisation of some of Sembawang ABÂ’s tenant units. 123 Sqn was renamed 124 Sqn, and continued in the training role with the AS 550A-2 while a new 123 Sqn was formed, operating the armed AS 220C-2 version. Some mystery still surrounds the fate of the 6 AS 350Bs, with some sources stating that they were sold to civilian operators in Australia while others stating that they continue serving with 124 Sqn in Singapore. Adding to the mystery is the fact that the Cambodian AF took delivery of 6 green-brown(similar to RSAF) AS 350Bs from an unknown source soon after the arrival of the RSAFÂ’s Fennecs.<br><br><img src="http://www.geocities.com/CapeCanaveral/3900/fennec-2.jpg"></div>

Why not retain the armed AS 220C-2 version as scout choppers and as training helo during peace time? Some of the Fennacs could also be converted for RSN uses right?
