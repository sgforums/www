            <div class='col-md body'>Then you do need to read up - it is a nuclear weapon.<br>there are major drawbacks to it though and there are conflicting theories about what or how much damage and how to deploy.<br>Along with EMP nuclear type weapons they are known as ER or Enhanced Radiation weapons.<br>The US, Soviet Union and others developed them during the Cold War.<br><br>the major problem with neutron bombs is that they:<br>1) require a nuclear detonation.<br>2) irradiate anything within its radius, a region which cannot be occupied for days without being irradiated and affected.<br>3) the nuclear material used has a short half-ife [read up people] - they require high-maintenance or they will exceed their half life and will no longer be effective.<br>That material is very difficult to continue to supply cheaply.<br>4) it can take hours before those affected [and not killed in the actual blast] feel any effects.<br>5) the idea that this weapon kills people but leaving everything else undamaged was greatly overstated by the popular media.<br>6) the effect of neutron bombs is greatly affected by the atmospheric conditions, high humidity has a greater absorption effect on the results of neutron weapon detonation.<br><br>In short, neutron bombs were too expensive, too high-maintenace, and offered more problems than they were worth developing as a major arsenal of any nuclear-club country [Their major proposed useage, limited by the problems encountered with this type of weapon, meant that they were relagated to tactical battlefield roles, the useage on cities etc was purely media speculation..].<br><br>And there is a strng link between Israel and the US - so much so that many middle eastern populace easily confuse the two, and the US military is often seen as a 'Jewish military', trying to expand its authority on the region [starting with israel of course, which the west created], which adds to the confusion and hatred of the US..<br></div>
