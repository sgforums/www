            <div class='col-md body'>Well i tink that the Terrex and SAR21 is what SG army is proud to have... I have seen terrex move around in jungle... They are good... They can do what an amourd 5 tonner can't do... I'm a 5 tonner driver,and 5 tonners  have some limitation... What 5 tonner cannot do is what terrex have to offer... They are one sturdy veh that i will love to drive around... As for SAR21,i have not used it personally myself but i tink its charging handle can be used by left and right hand is  quite good compared to M16 which u gotta use ur right hand to do it... I personally prefer the M16 as i am trained using it,and i tink that it is light... I tink that glock should give some credits to what STK and DSTA is trying to improve its weapons and veh to SAF... They are one bunch of ppl who worked thru their bones to see their product come out... Remember what happen to the cabbage rice combat ration??? DSTA sought our views to improve on the ration that wild boar will not even wanna to touch.. So what do we have now??? Canned drinks and tuna in our accsory packs... Improved flavour of our combat rations..</div>

I wish to correct this.  If a HEAT warhead hits the slat head on, it will still detonate and the standoff distance between the slat and the Stryker armor is too short to negate the effect of the molten jet. It will still penetrate the armor. The slat works only when warhead goes between the slats. The warhead mechanism will then be crushed and rendered useless and will therefore not detonate.<br><br>Totally agree with the posts that armor such as Terrex belong to policing rear areas but only in low threat situations where opposition may have only early versions of RPGs or small arms only.  You know what a 84 or LAW can do at close range to vehicles such as Terrex, what more latest variants of RPG7s and modern ATGMs.<br><br></div>

When such a person uses weasel words (<span style="color: red;">using dodgy words and phrases for emotional effect without supporting them</span>), evasion of blatant fact (after numerous posts comparing the factual weight of the SAR to similar systems and getting no real reply to them) to rely on common myth as "proven" opinion (<span style="color: red;">only taking opinion from people who are inexperienced with the weapon or worse, biased against it to start with </span>)... can one be surprised that they are constantly pummeled with posts they cannot answer to.<br><br>Given what has been revealed by STK, I do not think STK has NOT been listening in, but that someone in here needs to get their hearing and eyesight checked for it seems that despite all the Janes they may read, they seem to have missed out the very obvious point that this issue has be adressed.<br><br>At least I back up my long posts on my position with fact, logic, and a proper accounting of all the quarters in this discussion... what has yours possibly offered so far except a constant denial and demostration of your general ignorance in most matters in regards to many things in here?<br><br>It seems you have a habit of revisiting old points after they have been demolished by your opposition with the very same old position... as if hoping bringing up a position already demolished with the same failed arguments will somehow make wishful thinking truth.

A vehicle such as Terrex ( if the SAF fields it &amp; when we get it ) will naturally be a better option than an armored 5 tonner. However, it will be a more costly option.<br><br>A Terrex is still very vulnerable to RPGs and mines. Given that it has a large ( not to mention large signature ) passenger load, a hit from an RPG or ATGM will be devastating in terms of casualties. It shud not be exposed to the front lines. </blockquote>It seems to me that you have this mindset that if you have a hammer, everything is a nail... even your own foot and head.<br><br>In your quest to save cents, it seems you have lost all your sense. It's one thing to get things cheaper, or get things cheaper that are but totally useless in their role. You seem to be suggesting plenty of ideas and points that indicate that the utility of an idea is irrelevant, as long as costs are saved.<br><br>You are making a vast mistake in judgement here. One needs to realize that the Terrax and 5-tonners were made for greatly different roles. The tonners were intended to ferry stuff around and not designed for serious off-road action or what have you not. The primary purpose of the Terrax is more that of a combat swiss-army knife to fufill roles that require high mobility but yet firepower and some protection... roles that a tonner can never do.<br><br>You seem to have this one-track mind that the Terrax was only made to be a battle taxi, of which was never the whole idea in the first place. Carrying troops is just but one of the roles it carries out. Is it intended to duke it out with heavy units? I don't think so.<br><br>It's clear enough that the "armoured" 5-tonner you so idolize cannot be used in scouting roles, high mobility pursuit, engaging the enemy, fire support and what have you not. In fact it's main job is to do that- ferry stuff around.<br><br>Forward recon units will certainly slap you in the face if you told them to go about their role with an armoured 5-tonner. A bionix is way too big and hefty for them, and a Rover is for all purposes as good as a pickup. The only other (proper) alternatives are either the flyer LSV (a light which has extreme mobility and firepower but no protection), or something like the Terrax (a medium unit with a more balanced mixed of mobility, firepower, and protection). Can you rig a tonner to swim across a river? Is a tonner mine resistant like the Terrax? Can you mount serious weapons on a tonner?<br><br>As I said, in your desire to cut costs the only thing you seem to have cut is your own intelligence. One might as well equip our soldiers with bows and arrows to fight and spoons to dig shellscrape (can reuse ammo for the bow and arrow, and spoons can serve other purposes besides digging as well).<br><br>What is behind your irrational desire to blast the Terrax? One can only guess but I see no motivation except being totally ignorant and stubborn to good reason.<br><br>As some have said, your posts exibit a common sense of which we all don't know comes from where.</div>

When the Armoured 5 tonners doctrine were first created, the intent was for it to be used as a intermin KINS asset.  Let  us not forget that the armoured 5tonners DO NOT have proper over head cover.  Also, have you seen the armoured 5 tonners up close and operate from it before?  I have and i can tell you that despite being coated with ever coating and having whatever armour plates, the 5 tonners at best can only be classified as a sofrt skin vehicle.<br><br>Eventually, the AV81(or other wheeled platform) will tak over the armoured 5 tonners.<br><br>Mr Glock, Please go and get yourself a life...<br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br>Cheers!!</div>

Bro Beavan  was right that to say that the monster were not SUITABLE for Recce mission.<br><br>As for the seat belt, it is actually now a chargable offence if you were caught for not putting it on.  there were cases where servicemen fall off moving 5 tonners for not bucking up.   I have personally  witness one such incident.  The 5 tonner was turning out of Guards avenue with a truck load of NSmen when the one sitting nearest to the tailboard simply falls onto the road as the vehicle was turning out onto upper changi road.  Needless to say, there was a big hooha and more recently, a 5 tonner from XXX HQ overturned and troops behind were injureed cos they were also not bucked up.  As a result, HD GSI sent out a nasty email to all units CO and commanders to enforce the bucking up of the troops deck seat belt.  Failure to do so would render the unit commanders in deep shit.<br><br>Cheers!!</div>
