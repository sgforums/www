Nvm, let's try to tone down hostilities for everyone's sake.<br><br>Also, most of what you posted is more apporiate in the "procurement blunders" thread... why did you post here (lack of incriminating counter-posts?) I'll help you shift your posts.<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by glock:</div><div class="quote_body">Members shud not suppress the genuine feedback about the weight of the SAR 21 - there are many who do not have the opportunity to handle other fine weapons offered.

A lot of the members here are indeed giving their own feedback from their own handling of the weapon, having used it, shot it, and lived with it outfield.<br><br>As it stands, the weight issue is not a big highlight for many of us here and the current batches who train with the weapon. The weight issue was highlighted heavily in the early batches of troops who converted from heavy use of the M-16S1 to that weapon.<br><br>So I'm not sure removing kevlar plates, reducing barrel lengths, using lightweight (but very expensive) MARS sights and what have you not is really reflective of the current opinion of the SAF grunt. As it stands even reviewers of firearms who have handled plenty of weapons in their day don't really have an issue to pick with the SAR-21's weight (certainly not the Jane's reviewers)... most of the talk about the weight has an indeed has, come locally, and even that is being reversed by the opinion of the current batch.<br><br>So is the SAR-21 really heavier? Only if you choose to compare it against the most lightweight of designs but in terms of 5.56mm ARs is of an average weight.<br><br>Weight reduction was not one of the main issues highlighted by the ADF when they tested the first few marks of the weapon... they highlighted a lot of issues which were fixed in the current mark that is in widespread use, but weight apparently never made the list as a big issue.<br><br>If you want an idea of an needlessly heavy infantry battle rifle, try the British SA80 that ended up with its weight because of inherent design flaws that required counterbalances and renforcements that jacked up the weapon weight with no utility to its function at all.<br><br><blockquote><strong>I think no one can really admit  that the SAR 21 is really much better than the other modern rifles on offer. As to it being cheaper , no one really knows as any accountant can tell you - there are  liars, damned liars and ............ </strong></blockquote><br><br>Nobody in here has any illusions of the SAR-21 being a super-rifle as if its sheer use would determine death or victory. But what its long-time users know (as opposed to those who just converted to learning the weapon) that it is a reliable and capable piece of kit that gets the job done.<br><br>If I really had to make a choice as to what rifle to go into battle with, it would certainly make my list and more then ready to be considered by our armed forces.<br><br>So you are telling us that our accountants cannot be trusted either way... if they are saving money they won't tell us and if they are losing money they won't tell us either.<br><br>But what a lot of people are saying, LOGICALLY, unless something really extraordinary happens it is highly UNLIKELY that the SAR-21 would be more expensive then its counterparts. In the same vein we don't really know how much those chinese AK clones really cost to make, but what we do know seems to point to them being a lot cheaper then say your... G36C.<br><br>Hence I believe the onus of proof the determine that the SAR-21 is really more expensive really lies on you then on the opposition.<br><br><blockquote><strong><br>As to keeping the money in Singapore , again really how much we do not know as many components &amp; parts are sourced from foreign companies.....<br></strong></blockquote>Firstly, no matter how you add it up... having components sourced from other companies in your own design certainly still does not make a local unit more expensive then bying the whole thing piecemeal from a foreign developer.<br><br><blockquote><strong>Again, my belief is that we can live without having to design our own small arms................it is almost certain that the resources spent do not commensurate with the benefits derived. The SAR 21 can easily be substituted with any of the modern rifles such as the G36 which can be locally manufactured especially if some think that cost is not an issue, if iit is really more costly in the first place. </strong></blockquote>I think you have made your belief clear, but I'm not sure how many of your points involve wishful thinking then actually cold hard facts.<br><br>What do you mean that <strong>"it is almost certain that the resources spend do not commensurate with the benefits derived"</strong>? Do you actually have the facts and figures to prove that or are you really going by your gut feel?<br><br>And you have to do a lot of homework to prove that... given a lot of people here have posted literally overwhelming evidence as to why local arms procurement (even small arms) are beneficial. We have yet to see anything of that sort in your posts except a lot of "i think", "it is my opinion", "it is almost certain", "it is my belief"... fair enough... now <span style="font-style: italic;">prove them</span>.<br><br>I think moca put forward some rather convincing points as to why no matter how we add up, a locally manufactured design is still more economically viable then a license manufacture.<br><br>I think you have to do a lot more then say that accountants proving facts in favour of your opposition are "liars and damned liars" to really present anything in here... other then that your beliefs as much as we know what they are are just that: a religious statement of faith.<br><br>Indeed what is stopping others from assuming that you are just what you say accountants to be- a liar and a damned liar. At least we have the assurance that accountants will be taken to task and law if the numbers finally mistally too much, certainly decades of local arms procurement would have bled our nation much worse then the NKF... but a single person on the internet stating his beliefs without supporting them with proper facts and arguments I suspect... is far less trustworthy.<br><br>So we are still waiting... after so many posts... for you to really demostrate your beliefs convincingly. We know what you are saying... you have been saying it for countless posts but as it remains you have yet to seriously justify any of them on local arms procurement.<br></div>

One just has to look at the images captured in newsclips in war torn zones where these weapons are purported to be used to realize that the weapons used in these places are overwhelmingly AK47s and the like.

No. They set rather modest goals for the project and suceeded in creating a weapon that met the SAF requirements of being a cost-effective, reliable, and self-reliant upgrade to the M16S1.<br><br>Most importantly, did the SAF decide that to go locally made on a whim? When the requirement for a replacement firearm was raised, the SAF ran through many options and firearms from many different sources... <span style="font-style: italic;">including the G36C </span>before settling on the option to procure locally.

No one said that it is a good rifle and shud not be used for comparison. When given a choice, I myself will opt for the SAR 21 over the SA80. </strong><br><br>Exactly my point. The SA80 is a true example of a defective weapon system that we ought to chuck right out of the window if we ever came up with it. The SAR-21 however, is hardly that weapon. What the grunt really wants needs is a weapon that puts the bullets on spot, does not quit when you abuse it, and is idiot proof to keep going. The rest is really splitting hairs.<br><br>What we have is a decent, and cost effective piece of locally manufactured gear, and our grunts are certainly not disadvantaged carrying it into battle. A more worthy life and death issue would be getting stuff like proper body armour or armour kits for the soft skin units then haggling over assault rifle design.<br><br><blockquote><strong>The Terrex is a good case of not needing a weapons system to be developed or designed locally to meet a " unique " SAF requirement. Maybe it is also cheaper in this case.<br></strong></blockquote>Why state the obvious? ST is smart enough to know when to design stuff ourselves, or outsource it as and when needed. Our SAW was designed by an englishman, but the experience led to the C.I.S. 50. It would be foolish to forray into something yourself when you don't yet have the experience yourself and need to learn from others first.<br><br>You on the other hand seem to think that one solution fits all the questions. The SAF has shown considerable flexibility in sourcing its weapons and sometimes resorting to outright creativity to do so... why can't you exibit the same innovation in your thinking?<br><br>Unless of course it is your crusade to see the SAF equipped with the G36C  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"></strong></div>

Glock makes about barrel length, SAR-21s are produced in other lengths... the choice to stick with a '20 inch barrel for standard use was one that was made by the SAF, and ST simply followed their requirements to the letter.<br><br>Beyond that, I see no issue choosing '20 over '14 or '18... different lengths give you different things from your bullet. If other designers like different lengths fine with me, and the whole thing is really a non issue. His attempt to politicize and make this into an infexible issue is mostly an invention on Glock's part and I suggest we don't follow him into this folly and make a mountain out of molehills, as if our SAF soldiers are carrying a worthless extra '2 of metal into battle.

But as davechng already said, if you already have a bullpup design, why not max out the length you have? Who wants to fault the SAF for being kiasu?<br><br>Frankly I find his attempts to politicize this issue laughable, it's less of a argument, and more like a young child who simply can't (or refuses) wrap his head around certain things and makes a grand mess of things.<br><br></div>

Obviously a clean M-16 will be lighter given the SAR has internal to it a lot of things that had to be mounted to consider all things fairly.<br><br>The orginal design brief when Singapore was launching its ACR project in the mid 90s was to create a weapon that was <strong>lighter then an M-16 decked out with both scope and LAD, and with a cheaper per-unit cost to procure</strong>. After considering the arms that were on the market, including somebody's favourite weapon, it was realized that no current system on sale fit these requirements well and the decision was made to<br><br>AFAIK, arms contracts do not come cheap. As much as Glock likes to sing songs about license manufacture he seems to miss out on the fact that license manufacturing isfor procurement security, rather then cost-effectiveness. As long as you manufacture what is not legally considered your design, each copy (unless you are China and could not care less about legal process) you make is as good as if you have bought it from the manufacturer... the only difference being you have more control over the supply.<br><br>That is obviously a far from ideal position... also Glock seems to be missing out the fact that you actually have to get the company to agree to grant you the license to manufacture in the first place, and that is often the most tricky part of the deal. In fact the G36C can trace it's origin to the failure of Germany's part to get a license from Belgium's FAL, forcing them to look to local options.<br><br>Also, what makes him think H&amp;K is happy to devalue its most famous product by outsourcing its manufacture? They are happy as they are to camp where they are and provide the rights to their weapon only to the highest bidder, which put it way out of the SAF's league. Why do you think this weapon has only seen limited distribution in asia? Apparently Glock thinks getting a license from arms companies is a simple matter? And he took economics?<br><br>To note how neow H&amp;K are about their intellectual properity, the development costs for all G36 derivatives such as the KE module for the OICW, XM8 became so non-competitive and overrun that the Yanks, with their <span style="font-style: italic;">60B</span> a year budget, and having blown a lot of cash on their own ACR project decided to open up the contract to other companies to shake H&amp;K up and we all knew eventually how it ended.<br><br>The Germans make fantastic firearms, but dealing with them is another question altogether. But hey, they're Europeans!<br><br>There are many good reasons why the SAF has wisely decided not to go down the license manufacture path- again. And even if they did it is highly unlikely that they'll be making anything to do with a rifle from H&amp;K anytime soon.<br><br>So yeah, I'm not too sure what Glock is driving about with the songs and poems about the license manufacture of G36C, give it is prehaps only slightly below par in humour of the notion of us suddenly getting a license from the yanks to make the F-22. Not to mention having driven (no pun intended) a thread on the Terrex (of which apparently Glock has lost most of his voice on, when he was quite a baboon when it started) quite way off track.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>SGT-rex, your right.  That the SAR-21 is lighter than an M-16 equivalent w/ LAD, scope, and Kevlar protection.<br><br>But our friend glock isn't emphasizing on that, but on the default carrying weight instead.<br><br>In a way, he is also right that the load of the infantryman has increased with our locally developed technology instead of decrease.<br><br>If you remember the Land Warrior spoof video, I guess you'd recall what a joke the entire land warrior system is.  It'd be PERFECT if and only if the soldiers have a powersuit as well.<br><br>While I still favor the M-16 over the Sar-21 (mainly cos the weight is finely distributed over 2 hands), I do admit that target acquisition is a hell lot faster.  Overall, a more effective rifle for the Army as standard issue.  It is not too much technology for a soldier to quickly learn, and still increase effectiveness of a soldier.<br><br>So there, can we agree to disagree over the weight issue?<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I see consensus regarding the weight of the standard issue SAR 21 compared to other modern assault rifles &amp; it took probably more than two dozen posts to set the record straight. What is clear is that many chose not to admit the obvious.<br><br>Again, if members do read my posts , I never said that the standard issue SAR 21  was a bad rifle. I repeat for the umpteen time that  it is an improvement over the M16 though STK cud do something more to lighten the SAR 21 for the SAF infantryman who is truly overburdened Â– reading glasses are in order here for some.<br><br>Yes , an unnecessary extra 1/2  kg to lug around for a rifle is a big deal !  When you start to add a heavier Matador   ( compared to an Armbrust  )  plus a host of  new systems to the SAF soldierÂ’s load , the SAF soldier is really overburdened. Members who do not wish to highlight issues which can help the SAF infantryman do not have their interests at heart.<br><br>Whoever suggested that the SAF soldier is stupid has not served in the SAF.<br><br>The question about barrel lengths was not a trick question &amp; the need for a 20 in barrel to achieve higher velocities need not be defended to death Â– it is obvious that a longer barrel  will give bullets higher velocities. Although the American experience in combat has shown that the shorter barrels in M16 variants do not  have the same lethal terminal ballistics  as 20  in barrels,  this fact seems to have been lost with most rifle designers including the Israelis.  Then I guess, we Singaporeans &amp; Americans are smarter than the rest.<br><br>For some,  the  extra 2 inches of barrel IS critical &amp; thatÂ’s why  they go bananas Â– I  am saying ( as others do )  it is not critical  &amp; shud be choppedÂ…Â…Â… and monkeys do enjoy chewing up bananas.<br><br>We can buy German Leopard 2s but cannot get a license to manufacture G36s ? I am sure we did not ask. I guess the Leopard 2s are capable of doing less harm than G 36s.  Hope that we can in future buy spare parts for the Leos.  I also hope that the Leos are not duds. And yes G36s are nice  rifles, obviously.<br><br>However, it was not obvious to many that the Terrex is not a local design. The point made by some was that locally designed equipment to suit SAFÂ’s unique  needs cud be cheaper and that in this case  most of the money stays in Singapore. My point is that most likely not correct on  both counts. Anyway , the Terrex ( as others pointed out ) is just another armored vehicle. The SAR 21 is also another rifle. So what right ? Right.<br><br></div>

You are right,  I am no grunt, but I think the Mexicans must be offering good incentives for Asian grunts like yourself to join their army. With so much being said about Singapore talent being poached by other countries, here is an opportunity not to be missed by those who seek greener pastures overseas.

            <div class='col-md body'>YawnÂ… to your points I submit the same itinerary of rebuttals, considering you have not produced anything new (except perhaps to reach new heights of questionable logic).<br><br>I will however, point out the good humour in your recent posts:<br><br><blockquote>The Terrex has gone nowhere, is not cost effective and its not locally designed Â– all factual statements. Can t you swallow the truth ? </blockquote>The truth you canÂ’t swallow seems to be that you have not done your homework and are now trying to clutch at<br><br>And just how is the Terrex not cost-effective or going nowhere?<br><br>Locally designed? Refer to the Procurement Blunders thread.<br><br><blockquote>And by the way, the best accountants are always right because they ask this question first Â– how much do you want it to cost or how much profit or loss do you want for this financial year ? You are obviously not an accountant Â– poor thing, all the economics lessons gone to waste.</blockquote>LOL, given by many of your opinion and calculations on local procurementÂ… IÂ’m afraid the only one whoÂ’s economics lessons that have uttely gone to wasteÂ…. is you.<br><br><blockquote>Tyra, please stop putting words into other peoples months. I made no or little comments on SR Mortar, SLWAGL and CIS 50. I already confessed earlier that I knew little on these weapons. You must be having nightmares of Glock tearing up your points &amp; dreamt that I denigrated your pet weapons.</blockquote>Actually I enjoy your presence in here given it breaks the monotony of the forum and gives the rest a person to be united against, as well as to sharpen the wit of those in here. So actually I look forward to each and every time<br><br>Note that all your attempts to question local procurement have only strengthened a positive opinion on it. In a backhanded sort of way you are actually beneficial, and not detrimental to your opponents.<br><br>And what did I but mention these weapons but to demonstrate your pitiful understanding of them, hence brining into question your ability to make proper judgements on anything- a lack of ability that you unfortunately explicitly demonstrate yourself without really requiring intervention. But I simply helped you along.<br><br>So no, IÂ’m afraid I donÂ’t really have nightmares about youÂ… I actually find you kinda funny.<br><br><blockquote>You shud stop using Wikipedia as your source Â– its reputation on military matters is surpassed by Janes by a wide margin - you do read Janes do you ?<br><br>Huh ! Tyra is a Singapore grunt ?!? But I always thought that grunts only existed in the US Army. I am going straight to the Wiki website to search for Â“ Singapore Grunt Â“. It is a new animal to me.</blockquote>IÂ’m afraid judging by your track record, I am afraid it seems apparent that I might be more well read then youÂ… but itÂ’s only because it seems that you are [I]much less[/I] well read on anything then just about anybody.<br><br>LOL, I am not the first, nor the last in here, to refer to ourselves as Â“gruntsÂ”. Hence IÂ’m afraid your foray into semantics is going to fail like most of your other endeavours. This is because the rest know what I am referring to when I use the term, accept and understand it in a way that is useful and conducive for discussionÂ… unfortunately your deliberate misunderstanding of the term hurts only your credibility and not anybody elseÂ’s.<br><br>Sigh, do you really need to blow off your toes with every post?<br><br>Note that yet again your latest posts have failed to bulge the overwhelming weight of opinion against you but even an inch.<br><br>All in all a spirited attempt at rebuttal, but you really have to find better points and approaches. Feel free to try again though.<br></div>
