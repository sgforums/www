One active SAR coy ns-boys deployed with BA ah...you see that one ...not police stock.. </blockquote>AFAIK, it is the SAF's intention to eventually equip every grunt with body armour. BA is part of the 3G ACM system loadout.<br><br>The current standard-issue level III vests come in at about 8 kilos, which is comparable to the US interceptor vests with SAPI. Dragon Skin and the like is probably lighter but it seems they have some trouble passing their MILSPEC, and hence there has been a lot of talk lately on that with the yanks.<br><br>I've had the rare chance to try FIBUA with <span style="font-style: italic;">level 4</span> armour before (7.62 AP resistant)... and it really makes you feel safe. It is still entirely possible to do your combat drills with it so the level 3 vest, in which I've seen grunts doing fast roping with FBO, section weapons, with it (level 3) on before so the weight is not really an issue when it comes to combat effectiveness.<br><br>Not that we should be surprised... virtually every other army with BA as part of the loadout does it all of the time.<br><br>Of course, the LAPD SWAT actually employs something they deem as <span style="font-style: italic;">level 9</span> armour (which can stop shotgun slugs), which is as close to Robocop that you can get. Saw a feature on their level 9 loadout... very cool.<br><br>Note that the NIJ standards only run up level 4 in the civvie table. So there are apparently many other protection levels that are not openly talked about.<br><br>For body armour, there's some which you keep in storage and don it before going into mission, like SWAT or police applications... however vests for military use involve having to use the vest under extreme conditions, such as prolonged wear and exposure to heat and moisture, which might rapidly degrade the protective ability of some vests which use materials sensitive to such effects.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by spartan6:</div><div class="quote_body">They will be usefull in base security roles</div></blockquote>Yes very useful !!! because of their speed, low noise, cost of operation (less fuel), availability and wheels do not damage roads like tracks.<br><br>Imagine patrolling a airbase with a track vehicle - the amount of fuel you use compare to a wheel vehicle.  The noise of the track will be heard for miles haha no need to patrol , all intruders take cover. Also the track will damage the roads and runway - yes you can put rubber pads for tracks, but they will fall off -which will inclurred more down time and maintenace and affect availabilities. Also they are very manuable thus very hard to hit them as terrex will be a fast moving target.<br><br>For convoy is very good also, because its speed let it run up and down the convoy, also let it response fast to any threats.  Also use less fuel then tracked vehicles, but still have good enough armour and a wide range of weapons able to be fix on. As problem shown in iraq, the main problem is landmines. Terrex main adv is that if it got hit, it will be damage, but the soldiers will most likely be ok. As its design is to channel the blast away, also it is wheeled, thus repair of it is much easier and less costly.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by glock:</div><div class="quote_body">I see consensus regarding the weight of the standard issue SAR 21 compared to other modern assault rifles &amp; it took probably more than two dozen posts to set the record straight. What is clear is that many chose not to admit the obvious.<br><br>Again, if members do read my posts , I never said that the standard issue SAR 21  was a bad rifle. I repeat for the umpteen time that  it is an improvement over the M16 though STK cud do something more to lighten the SAR 21 for the SAF infantryman who is truly overburdened Â– reading glasses are in order here for some.<br><br>Yes , an unnecessary extra 1/2  kg to lug around for a rifle is a big deal !  When you start to add a heavier Matador   ( compared to an Armbrust  )  plus a host of  new systems to the SAF soldierÂ’s load , the SAF soldier is really overburdened. Members who do not wish to highlight issues which can help the SAF infantryman do not have their interests at heart.<br><br>Whoever suggested that the SAF soldier is stupid has not served in the SAF.<br><br>The question about barrel lengths was not a trick question &amp; the need for a 20 in barrel to achieve higher velocities need not be defended to death Â– it is obvious that a longer barrel  will give bullets higher velocities. Although the American experience in combat has shown that the shorter barrels in M16 variants do not  have the same lethal terminal ballistics  as 20  in barrels,  this fact seems to have been lost with most rifle designers including the Israelis.  Then I guess, we Singaporeans &amp; Americans are smarter than the rest.<br><br>For some,  the  extra 2 inches of barrel IS critical &amp; thatÂ’s why  they go bananas Â– I  am saying ( as others do )  it is not critical  &amp; shud be choppedÂ…Â…Â… and monkeys do enjoy chewing up bananas.<br><br>We can buy German Leopard 2s but cannot get a license to manufacture G36s ? I am sure we did not ask. I guess the Leopard 2s are capable of doing less harm than G 36s.  Hope that we can in future buy spare parts for the Leos.  I also hope that the Leos are not duds. And yes G36s are nice  rifles, obviously.<br><br>However, it was not obvious to many that the Terrex is not a local design. The point made by some was that locally designed equipment to suit SAFÂ’s unique  needs cud be cheaper and that in this case  most of the money stays in Singapore. My point is that most likely not correct on  both counts. Anyway , the Terrex ( as others pointed out ) is just another armored vehicle. The SAR 21 is also another rifle. So what right ? Right.<br></div></blockquote>I believe in sgf most of the members are rifleman or have given training in infantry fighting,i belong the the latter group... I have use M16S1,did not use SAR21 but have touch here abit ,touch there abit and SAF carbine... I personally find that SAR21 is indeed a very mighty fine rifle to use,the scope is damn good and M16S1 is also fine to use... Nw the extra 1/2 kg of weight,let me ask glock that how much did a field pack weight??? I remember is coming close to 20kgs... And the extra weight of like 1/2kg,is too much for glock??? From what i know a matordor is a fire and forget weapon,u throw away after use... The rifleman might kpkb about the whole overall weight,but end of the day,they get the job done and they forget about the whole weight issue... And we acquire the german Leos,how old is the current tank M1(correct me if i'm wrong),it been damn mighty long,it been around since my father's time... The tanks might been upgrade a few times but when the times come to change,we jump at the chance to change it... Are we going to buy the bradleys from uncle sam,or buy the new kimchi-land tank??? SAF might have is reasons when they acquire the the 2nd-hand Leos... And who care whether the Terrex is not a local design,as long DSTA can change it to suit SAF's needs,can get the job done... End of story....<br></div>
