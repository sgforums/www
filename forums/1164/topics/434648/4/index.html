              <p>I never said Malaysia is not wrong. <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>IT IS YOU WHO ARE TWISTING
              FACTS AND LYING.</strong></span></p>
              <p>But thanks. Malaysia is racist (I say one hor) but Singapore
              loves foreigners. If I go I can come back here on Employment Pass
              and enjoy more privileges than you.</p>
              <p>By special agreement with Malaysia I can still be paid my CPF,
              but can take it all out at age 55.</p>
              <p>I don't need a flat as I have private property.</p>
              <p>And as a Malaysian I can drive my Malaysian car here for 3
              months, unlike citizens who are not allowed to drive Malaysian cars
              here for even a day. If I go back on weekends the 3 months can last
              quite long and I can swap cars with my family members! I like
              Volvo, how about you?</p>
              <p>You still wanna continue your fucking personal feud?</p>

              <p>despite you admitting that malaysia is a racist nation, yet you still feel that by leaving singapore and coming back as a malaysian EP, you will enjoy more privilege then a singapore citizen, wats holding you back? </p>
              <p>wat does you having private properties gotta do with our discussion?</p>

              <p>"Secret" tanks aren't really useful due to limited training 
              opportunities (affecting both firing accuracy and manouevre 
              effectiveness). Consider how many exercises the L2SG has already undergone.</p>
              <p>Singapore's requirement for MBT is limited imho. The 100-200km 
              jungle frontage in the Malay peninsular and limited depth restricts MBT 
              usage. A single L44 gun has a 4km effective range which covers 8km of 
              frontage before movement. Even ATGMs have increasing range (25km if 
              considering the spike NLOS). A lot of other equipment today replicates some of the MBT roles eg Apaches, Himars, Spike-LR (on LSVs) etc which reduces the need for MBTs.</p>
              <p>The thing about the arms trade today is that its a lot more transparent. Unless its home developed, most transfers will end up reported today.</p>

              <p>This is a slightly different context. The first 2 MBTs did not serve operational roles and did not train large numbers of crews.</p>
              <p>Extra L2s will be of the same type as the tanks we operate, and we can train many crews for them using the public tank stock. They will be useful as individual replacements or for equipping NS units, just like the ~350 AMX-13 which were never acknowledged.</p>

              <p>This is a slightly different context. The first 2 MBTs did not serve operational roles and did not train large numbers of crews.</p>
              <p>Extra L2s will be of the same type as the tanks we operate, and we can train many crews for them using the public tank stock. They will be useful as individual replacements or for equipping NS units, just like the ~350 AMX-13 which were never acknowledged.</p>

              <p><br>The AMX-13 was acknowledged. In fact, it was publicly displayed in the 1969 NDP. Numbers are generally not published by Mindef. The exception being the L2 purchase.</p>
              <p>350 was, I think, an estimation by IISS. Not to mistake though, there's a lot of them around.</p>
              <p>History documents the examples and failures of newly or weakly crewed tanks. That's not counting the lack of logistical support eg ammo, spares etc that will remove any medium term use of a "secret" tank.</p>

              <p>Specific to the AMX-13s, I don't think such a high figure was acknowledged but they were going at $1 each, it made sense to buy many. A good many were used for spares or converted into other vehicles, so the reporting of "tanks" was sidestepped if ever necessary to do so.</p>

              <p>I don't think so, AMX-10 has been exhibited at AOH so no mystery there. He was trying to preserve opsec.</p>

              David Boey knows the difference between an MBT and a light tank/arm car. When one thinks about peninsular security, Thailand is the logical choice for placing armour in defense. Defends against India, China and Vietnam, 3 birds in 1 country. 50 km at its narrowest point in the Kra Isthmus.
              
              Logical 2nd MBT types would be the Magach (M48/M60), both of which are operated by Thailand. There are over 1000 in Israel which were replaced by Merkavas.

              <p>Do you think these tanks were for more than evaluation purposes? This would have required extensive training to be conducted on the tank and probably require crews to be posted to Thailand for long periods of time.</p>
              <p>Is there any open speculation on the time frame the Centurion and the 2nd MBT were acquired? A rough idea will help our speculation on this 2nd MBT type, and our understanding of the regional security situation at the time.</p>
              <p>M48/60: Taiwan operates them as well. This choice of tank also facilitates us to engage some of the world's best tank instructors.</p>

              Must be someone else, my only Guards unit was 3rd Guards BMT in Nee Soon.
              
              Not too familiar with the Magach, the only tanks I'm familiar with that had M48/60 were the American Walker and Patton. Any idea when David served? If he's very, very old, could it be that we got some surplus Super Shermans from the Israelis?
              
              As for the Centurions, I'm guessing they were either for study, target practice or to scare others off judging from their condition (rusted brown and hull paper thin, missing tracks, roadwheels etc) though that could have been after they were declared scrap. Totally unusable.
              
              Talking about unknown tanks, I was in NS when they were roadtesting the Bionix under dri-clad covers, my unit kept reporting them as Stormers due to their shape. We thought the SAF was going British for a while. :P
