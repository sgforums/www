              Pls lah, Germany &amp; Dutch 2nd hand L2A4 sales to Austria, Canada, Chile, Finland, Greece, Poland, Spain &amp; Sweden are already higher than SG. Turkey would be the highest. With 2,570 L2A4s produced by the 2 alone, its a big pool.
              
              That's not counting Leopard 1 2nd hands. That's a bigger pool of 6,XXX.
              
              I suspect the article mentioned about S'pore having whatever might have either the letters PDS in reverse or TR somewhere....Alternate reality.

              <p>bo leh...............i read up an article that say S'pore has
              most or 2nd most number of used Leopards..................the
              reburbished one.................not the later
              models................</p>

              <p>Okay then..... I dare you to state your source.</p>
              <p>And before you dare say that I got my info from Wikipedia, here's my source:</p>
              <p><a href="http://www.army-technology.com/projects/leopard/">Army Technology: Leopard 2 Main Battle Tank, Germany</a></p>
              <p>I quote my source:</p>
              <p><em>The Finnish Army has bought 124 tanks, and the Polish Army bought 128 used Leopard 2A4 tanks from Germany.</em></p>
              <p><em>In August 2005, Greece placed an order for 183 used Leopard 2A4 and 150 Leopard 1A5 tanks from German Army reserves.</em></p>
              <p><em>In November 2005, an agreement was signed for the sale of 298 German army Leopard 2A4 tanks to Turkey.</em></p>
              <p><em>In March 2006, Chile signed a contract for the acquisition of 140 
              Leopard 2A4 tanks from the German Army. The first was delivered in 
              December 2007.</em></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>So Finland, Poland, Greece, Chile (and especially) Turkey all have more Leopard 2A4s than we do.</p>
              <p>So what's<em> your</em> source? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="icon_rolleyes.gif"></p>

              <p>As my BMT platoon sergeant would say, I thought, you think, who confirm? Then he would order you to drop 20 or to run and touch a faraway tree.</p>
              <p>And simi 'wiki also'? If you had bothered clicking on the link I gave, you would find that it <em>wasn't</em> Wikipedia.</p>
              <p>And if you <em>had</em> bothered to go to Wikipedia recently anyway, they would have given you the same figures I gave.</p>
              <p>And your excuse of '2 years back' doesn't work, because 2 years ago in 2009, all those countries I mentioned already had all those numbers of tanks.</p>
              <p>FAIL on multiple counts.</p>

              <p>If this susanteo whoever doesn't claim its from SDPleaks, stand up, say so &amp; claim its just self-created BS with no political affiliation.

              <p>L2s are defensive creatures intended to stop the hordes of Russki tanks during the cold war. All of the L2 buyers, unlike M1s, so far have used it in a defensive role (exception: Afghanistan which is a counter-insurgency role). SG isn't an exception. The Europeans are very circumspect in who they sell arms to.</p>

                          lack of a source reflects on the person.</p>
              <p>L2s are defensive creatures intended to stop the hordes of
                          Russki tanks during the cold war. All of the L2 buyers, unlike M1s,
                          so far have used it in a defensive role (exception: Afghanistan
                          which is a counter-insurgency role). SG isn't an exception. The
                          Europeans are very circumspect in who they sell arms to.</p>
              </div>

              <p>I'm only saying it will be L2s driving into Malaysia and not waiting for PT-91s to drive into Singapore. It is the PT-91s who will be hull-down (to the best of their ability).</p>
              <p>I believe NSP's manifesto includes "build up Navy and Air Force in lieu of Army so as to reduce NS duration" noting that it is best to keep our enemies as far away as possible. Tan Chuan Jin spoke up to say Iraq and Afghanistan are numbers games which show this is not possible. WP and SPP had no proposals on defence.</p>
              <p>I don't dismiss it as crazy because many first world armies prove soldiers can be sufficiently trained in a shorter duration. The challenges are organisational and not practical.</p>
              <p>For example, 2.5 years NS was instituted but not made universal so that 2LT, 3SG and CPLs would be around to accompany the LCPs through their 2 years. Yet it was retained for far longer than necessary, after the days of mono-intake-by-default ended.</p>
              <p>The last months of NS represent more "mobilised reserve" than "training". And we know that in a war, less than the total of 400,000 available reservists will be put into the field or the economy stops. It makes sense to me to put them back into the economy in peacetime, but evidently that is the sacrifice the leadership makes on our behalf.</p>
              <p>Anyway I noticed that whenever susanteo is around, a certain gentleman who types the same way and has gone through many usernames is absent.</p>

              <p>The outcome of a war is only you win or you lose. If you suspect that when you win, the ruling party would emerge stronger, then you have lost the war, better let outsider decide the course for your country rather than your own opposition in the country. Stretch it a bit further, if you dont want a particular party to rule singapore, would you call in a foreign army to take them down?</p>

              <p>In times of war, the government that represent the country has the duty to unite the people against outside aggression. The opposition and those who are against the government also have the responsibility to rally the people to protect the country! if they take the opportunity of a war to rid of their opposition, whether for or against the government, putting the country at greater risk, they are committing treason! period.</p>
              <p>Everybody, including the media and critics are free to say whatever they want at anytime, for the better of their country, not for their own agenda! If media and critics just hide behind the safety of our armed forces to report the movement of our forces, thus jeopardizing the armed forces and the country, they would be put away as spy, under military law. Traitors, spies, opportunitists DO NOT have freedom!</p>
              <p>Let me put this clearly, if you have nothing, being vocal will not earn you anything. It is those who have something who WILL make a stand, for what we have, families, friends, wealth...... a country of our own, that you can take it to the bank.</p>

              <p>I never said Malaysia is not wrong.<span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong> IT IS YOU WHO ARE TWISTING FACTS AND LYING.</strong></span></p>
              <p>But thanks. Malaysia is racist (I say one hor) but Singapore loves foreigners. If I go I can come back here on Employment Pass and enjoy more privileges than you.</p>
              <p>By special agreement with Malaysia I can still be paid my CPF, but can take it all out at age 55.</p>
              <p>I don't need a flat as I have private property.</p>
              <p>And as a Malaysian I can drive my Malaysian car here for 3 months, unlike citizens who are not allowed to drive Malaysian cars here for even a day. If I go back on weekends the 3 months can last quite long and I can swap cars with my family members! I like Volvo, how about you?</p>
              <p>You still wanna continue your fucking personal feud?</p>
