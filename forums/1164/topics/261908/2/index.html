Been noticing, and still confirming, that the American are mounting ERA on their Frontal Arc, as part of their new TUSK upgrade.<br><br>Picture of Frontal Armour penetration, but by what?  From the blur image, cannot tell definitely if it was a APFSD (which most likely be an American shot) or a ATGM.<br><img src="http://img514.imageshack.us/img514/3924/abrams29im2.jpg"><br><br>Please accept my apologies.</div></blockquote>What do you mean not many people know that the Abrams has weak spots?

And it looks like the Abrams in question survived whatever that was thrown at it.<br><br>No armour in invulnerable, but I find it dubious that the insurgents have anything that can penetrate the frontal turret armour of the HA variant of the Abrams, which has over 1000mm RHA versus CE, and tanks are in short supply for them to toss APFSDS rounds downrange.<br><br>It does not look like APFSDS or HEAT damage. An APFSDS entry crater will be small and not the dimple we see. The entry hole of HEAT is also small, as well as significant splattering pattern around the hole. And the paintwork would almost certainly be burnt.<br><br>My guess? It looks like damage caused by an EFP, which is becoming somewhat common in IEDs nowadays. The large and flat crater patter seems to account for the damage.</div>

And the validity of armour against insurgents...welcome to the new world man. If it was 8-10yrs ago...when you see an M1 headed towards you, you will be afraid. Recoilless rifles can't do nuts to them, ATGM technology back then wasn't as developed. But in this day and age...like I've said many times before...there's absolutely no reason to fear tanks if you're a modern army or a insurgent. Tanks are built to be fists, crushing down and softening up the enemy of established armies. But insurgents? In the day, they are your peasants, at night they are your terrorists...its like back to Vietnam all over again. The internet has fueled the ability of those seeking to kill by providing information. The IEDs used...ingenious. So far if you ask me, I did say that the US despite their strength and superiority in technology...they are still learning to fight wars the new way.

Sometimes good ol' fashioned man controlled weapons are enough, no need for some hi-tech b/s. Its just like NASA, when they first found that its impossible to write in space with pens, they immediately launched into a programme spending millions just to developed a pressurized pen that allows their guys in space to write in space. While the Russkies simply used pencils.<br><br>And the Chinese are different because they are a mainstream army. What I'm comparing with is the conflict between the armies of two states. Not an army and that of a insurgent. Fighting between two groups with fixed identities.Nothing that will change/evolve overnight.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Back to OP...<br>I think the author of that STForum post was envisioning MRAPS that the US and allied military are now acquiring for Iraq and Afghanistan to replace Humvees and Land Rovers. But the insurgents have a new weapon - EFP - which can penetrate unarmored MRAPs and even armoured vehicles like M1 and Challenger MBTs. These are supposedly manufactured in Iran or with Iranian help. See links below:<br>http://www.usatoday.com/news/world/iraq/2007-05-31-mrap-insurgents_N.htm<br>http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/6586401.stm<br><br>As I see it, modern warfare is evolution in action, each side comes up with something to counter the other side, so no one side can be invincible for long (unless the other side surrenders or is wiped out).<br>OWS takes up precious room in the 5 tonner, is expensive and requires trained crew as someone said earlier. Maybe a 0.5 MG or ST 40mm grenade launcher in front is the most we can expect for this vehicle. I presume these 5 tonners are not meant for frontline fighting, more for transporting large numbers/amounts of troops and supplies behind the frontline and only need basic armor for the rare firefight/ambush, or deployed in low intensity conflicts/peacekeeping missions with no threats from mines, hence Mindef thinks they have sufficient armour and guns for self defence. I just pray they don't run over a mine/IED when they are deployed.</div>

Fortunately, such massive IEDs are difficult to plant but when planted are prehaps the ultimate danger that no armour can save you from.<br><br>The protection package of the M1A2 SEP is pretty impressive, if not one of the most effective in the world today, but we all know no tank is invulnerable.<br><br>As it stands I don't know what damaged that M1 in the pic, but it does not seem to be an APFSDS, nor does it have the burn/splatter pattern of a HEAT warhead. It looked like some rather large, solid object hit it and made the hole, but not as narrow as an APFSDS... my guess is an EFP.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>well personally althought its armor may not be particulary effective as some of you guys say, but as a man on the ground i think i would feel psychologically better if i had some sort of steel around me instead of canvas and some means to shoot back at the enemy instad of waiting to be gunned.<br><br>but of course things can be improved, but its a start</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Slightly O/T<br><br>Ristar,  ATGM refers to Anti-Tank Guided Munitions.  Generally referring to missiles like the Spike, Milan etc.<br><br>AGMs (Air to Ground Munitions) in your example, may not necessarily be used to bust tanks.  The AGM-65 mavericks however, does that job well.  However, these missiles can only armed on aircraft like our F-5 and F-16s.<br><br>Mavericks are really versatile.  If you don't have a navigation pod for those moonless nights, just power up a maverick, and fly off your MFD!</div>
