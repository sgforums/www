There are definately enough tomb stones of WW II infantry vets during Battle for Britain,  Battle for Atlantic &amp; Falkland war.

Otherwise how are you going to explain about all the WW II tomb stones without insulting its occupants?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_confused.gif" alt="Confused" title="Confused"> </div></blockquote>No twisting of history! Many battles were fought during WW2. Infantryman might died during Brittle for Britain, but were they the "workhorse" of the battle? How could infantryman be the "workhorse" of the battle for the Atlantic, the Battle of Midway? the troopers manning stations on the convoys? or the AA gunners?<br><br>If the Argentine airforce or the navy sank QE2 ferrying the British troops, before it reaches Falkland, the war would have stopped there with thousands of british infantry in the bottom of the sea. No infantrymen on both sides would have fired one single shot! Would they then be the workhorse of the war?<br><br>There lied in the tomb stones of WW2 soldiers of all kinds, including infantryman, how are you going to claim glory for the infantryman without insulting the other occupants of the tomb stones??</div>

During WW2, other units were formed, besides the air forces and the navy. Many crucial battles on land were fought with paratroopers behind enemy lines (operation market garden), marines fighting from island to island (battles in the pacific), armour leading the assults in breakthrough of enemy defences(The Blitzkrieg).... Even the engineers were deployed in the front in Yom Kippur War by the Eygptian army, using high pressure water jet to reduce the sand dune built by the Isrealis. In modern warfare the signallers play more significant role in coordinating fires to prevent bombing friendly forces. The ultimate winner or loser of a war is not one particular unit, but the whole armed forces and the nation.<br><br>Honor and glory go to the units which accomplished their missions, won the war ultimately and survived!!</div>
