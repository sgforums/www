There are definately enough tomb stones of WW II infantry vets during Battle for Britain,  Battle for Atlantic &amp; Falkland war.  But if you are referring to the battles fought of shore then you're judging the grid of the war to a particular area &amp; only in that concept would your point be abit acceptable.  Otherwise how are you going to explain about all the WW II tomb stones without insulting its occupants?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_confused.gif" alt="Confused" title="Confused"></div>
