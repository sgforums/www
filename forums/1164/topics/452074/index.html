              <p>"<strong>Last July</strong>, Singapore agreed to let the Navy permanently station <strong>a number</strong> of LCSs <strong>in their territorial waters</strong>."</p>
              <p>http://defense.aol.com/2012/01/10/navy-sees-lcs-as-key-to-global-partnerships/</p>
              <p>But the Defense Minister is also quick to point out that the American 
                              ships will only operate out of Singapore "<strong>on a rotational basis</strong>," rather
                               than being permanently based there, and in fact <strong>demanded a correction 
                              to an earlier version of this very article that used the politically 
                              loaded word "base."</strong> Singaporean officials still emphasize they are 
                              simply America's "partner," not a formal ally, and that they have no 
                              desire to take sides in any kind of Sino-American Cold War. Except, of 
                              course, they want us there as a very clear message to China but without 
                              diplomatically throwing sand in the local bully's face.</p>
              <p>http://defense.aol.com/2012/04/05/us-should-be-dominant-in-pacific-but-must-make-nice-with-chi/</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>-When was this agreed?</p>
              <p>-What number of LCS?</p>
              <p>-What about the LCS's mission and can it perform its mission directly from here?</p>
              <p>-Most of the time, do they get laid up here or anchor offshore?</p>
              <p>-The major part of the LCS' duties are visiting regional ports and trying concepts at sea. Given this, is a "rotational basis" very different from basing? What is "one rotation"? Does sailing out to visit a regional port and back count as one? 
              Will Singapore be the point of return for the LCS instead of Japan, Guam
               or Hawaii?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>-If "rotation" is so "light", why must you differentiate it from the current arrangement of "port visits"? </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>-Please ignore the DF and move on if he gets rhetorical. It's high time to show it doesn't get any attention.</p>

              I think details are not finalized.
              
              The question is will the ships be home ported here or just a replenishment stop.  I think the US wanted the ships here.  We, of course want them to be refueled, restocked and moved off.
              
              Permanent basing will bring indefinite headaches.

              <p>You have no basis for these assertions.</p>
              <p>Singapore did not "expressed strongly that we are 'too small' to be a
              US base." It only objected to use of the word "base" because it has connotations. Singapore prefers to call it "rotations" meaning the 2 LCS will be here for some time each year, then be in some other regional port before coming back again. Which is ike a different kind of basing.</p>
              <p>If you are not aware, Singapore has been permanent home to a US Navy logistics unit for over 20 years. This unit arranges logistics for USN ships visiting Singapore and onward shipment tot those in the region.</p>
              <p>Finally the main problem is not kicking them out but the perception problem with Singapore's neighbours.</p>
