            <div class='col-md body'><p>Contrary to popular opinion, an anti-air missile like the Standard SM-2 is quite capable of sinking a ship. Sure not just one round, but a few. The SM-2 has an air to ground mode if required. Why do I say this? Simple, shrapnel sinks ships. It shears through the ship's hull and leaves it with innumerable number of holes. The end result is a never ending fight to keep the ship from leaking and then it sinks. Throw in very combustible rocket fuel that keeps burning, the ship will die either from a thousand cuts, or just burn to death. Mind, these missiles travel at MACH 4 and above. Kinetic energy alone would pierce most ship's hulls.</p></div>

              <p>weasel, so true, but GBUs have a big flaw. They are mostly gravity bombs, which mean you have to get in  very close, and it might be better not to have a 100M dollar (F-35 price range) fighter close in to such a range a $15,000 SAM can kill it.</p>
              <p>The more traditional way to settle this is to fire long ranged anti-ship missiles like Harpoons or Exocets from far away in huge numbers and let them swarm the ship. Less costly than losing a plane and pilot by 100x (1 Harpoon = 1M +/-, 1 F-35 = 100M- see wiki for cost comparison)</p>

              <p>JDAMs (esp the lighter 500lb GBU-38/54s) have a good range (~10-24km) which is best fired on a level flight. An F-35 is actually perfect as it can get in far closer than an F-15 or F-16. An F-35 can also use SDB IIs (80-110km range). Alternatively, if one uses the JDAM-ER, then range extends dramatically.</p>
              <p>$15,000 SAMs can't reach beyond 10km. $XXXk SAMs can reach up to ~40 kms. $Xm SAMs can reach 100km and beyond. An SM-6 can cost as much as $10m each.</p>
              <p>JSOWs of which the C variant is anti-ship have good range as well (110km). 110km means beyond Aster range. RSAF has JSOWs C variants.</p>
              <p>A JDAM is cheap at $50k each. A JSOW costs $400k. A Harp cost ~$3m each (equivalent to 60 JDAMs).</p>
              <p>Looking at this region's navy, how many air defence ships do others have? Looking at the SAMs equipping the ships of the region's navies, a lot of potential targets even for GBUs.</p>

              <p>Because it was designed as a convoy/fleet air defence/network ship. Or at least that is what the RSN say. That it was to be the nexus of a networked fleet, hence it needs a bit of fleet defence capability.</p>
              <p>And though the missile/JSOW has a very long range, it still has to get to range = 0 to kill a target. This is where your chance to save yourself or your ship consort comes in. Though if weasel is right, you probably only have a shot at the bomb/missile, not the actual fighter as it is very far out of range that even if you shot at it, it has a lot of time to evade.</p>
              <p>I still don't want ANY pilot or fighter in SAM range though, a single lucky shot and a 100M dollar plane can go splash for the cost of a "xxx K" SAM. Not to mention the loss of combat efficiency with the loss of a plane from a squadron. weasel probably has the best idea, flood the ships AA with so many targets from range that one is bound to hit.</p>
              <p>"Throw in very combustible rocket fuel that keeps burning, the ship will die either from a thousand cuts, or just burn to death. Mind, these missiles travel at MACH 4 and above. Kinetic energy alone would pierce most ship's hulls."</p>
              <p>Remember the Shefield!!! :)</p>
              <p>This is also why CIWS is getting out of date, a wall of 20mm can't stop a Mach 2-4 missile even if it hits, the momentum is too great, the debris and the solid fuel booster will still coast into the target on momentum alone. This is one of the reason for larger calibre air-defence guns nowadays. At least with a larger calibre, the chance of knocking the trash to one side is greater.</p>

              <p>And amanda, almost EVERY navy has a form of cruise missile or other. And if you're drooling over the Sunburn and Onyx, you really do not want the Brahamos against you. And it's one of the proposed armament of Malaysia's Kedah class warships.</p>
              <p>weasel, there was a Mindef propoganda piece that stated that the FFGs operated a "unique configuration of Astor 15s and 30s". Can't find it, but I take it to mean they wanted all Astor 30s but were too cheap to spring for it, so some of the launchers got short changed. :P</p>

              <p>"Anti-Ballistic Missiles"</p>
              <p>From where? :)</p>
              <p>And amanda, almost EVERY navy has a form of cruise missile or other. And if you're drooling over the Sunburn and Onyx, you really do not want the Brahamos against you. And it's one of the proposed armament of Malaysia's Kedah class warships.</p>
              <p>weasel, there was a Mindef propoganda piece that stated that the FFGs operated a "unique configuration of Astor 15s and 30s". Can't find it, but I take it to mean they wanted all Astor 30s but were too cheap to spring for it, so some of the launchers got short changed. :P</p>
              </div>
              </blockquote>
              <p>Well, the Astor 30s are definitely a better bet against the Sunburn variety missiles, to be sure... :P</p>
              <p>As for those, I suspect there are provisions, barring limitations due to the radar. The ones we are using aren't exactly up there in the top rungs of radar sets around....</p>

              <p>Yeah I heard speculation, but no hard facts. The RSN plays with it's cards very close to the vest.</p>
              <p>OTOH, there ARE ways to bypass a crummy radar. Interlink with the Gulfstreams? You only need to guide until final aquisition, the Astor has it's own seeker. Possible solution?</p>
              <p>"Well I'm not sure the air force willl be around if say the frigate is in the middle of the Pacific Ocean."</p>
              <p>If the frigate is in the middle of the Pacific Ocean in a war to defend Singapore... I say fire the navigator. :P</p>
              <p>And that area, cruise missiles are more likely. Planes don't usually cruise far from their bases unless someone really screwed up and gave away the route taken, AND the "enemy" wants to do a really extended range sortie. More likely combatants are chance encounters with warships/subs due to their long cruising endurance.</p>

              <p>There are facts like the herakles radar can't point upwards ie only up to 70deg elevation (official datasheet). In theory, any missile that has an inbound profile of more than 70 deg would not be trackable. The frigates were not intended as ABM platforms nor is there anyone with a proven ASBM capability.</p>
              <p>Interestingly, one SAM system that has a limited TBM capability (in SG inventory and proven in that role in combat with the US marines) is the I-hawk.</p>

              <p>The US F-15Es were bought in the 80s and early 90s. Even the typhoon, introduced this decade, had a major crash last August and required the grounding of several european fleets.</p>
              <p>The Singapore F-15SG, which is again a new build, is actually equipped with sub-systems that are superior to existing F-15Es such as the AESA radar (that is now only being retrofit in stages to existing USAF F-15Es).</p>
              <p>More than half the F-15SG fleet is now based in Singapore so they are home.</p>
              <p>Its about 20 hours flying time to cover the 17-18,000 km journey from the US to Singapore. Anyone who has taken a trip to the US by plane would know that (and generally boeing jetliners fly at ~9XXkm/h or ~500 knots). The F-15SG can carry more fuel than the F-16s.</p>
