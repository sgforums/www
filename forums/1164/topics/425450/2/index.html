              <p><br>Well, that would depend on if you're planning a fleet support ship or a solo mission ship. If fleet, then it's someone else's job to do the killing, and specialization allows for a more capable ship in the role. On the other hand, a solo-mission ship needs to be a bit of a jack of all trades, master of none. So guess in short, it depends on your navy's tactics.</p>

              <p>True but in all cases, one should have everything. Western Navies think its ok to arm a ship only for one role. Russia and China dont</p>

              <p>It would be nice to have a factual basis to a lot of the sound-bites I'm reading here. Too much inaccuracies to correct.</p>
              <p>If China didn't subscribe to single role ships, how would one characterise the type 022s...or the Russian pauks etc.</p>
              <p>Someone should have clarified the context in which the original question. For example, Crumpler SG would have been absolutely correct to state none of the above in the context of the choices of ADS for RSN esp since the RSN can't afford to crew any of the above ships in the numbers required.</p>
              <p>However, from the perspective of the UK, the Type 45s were of course favoured by the British, whilst the Americans prefers the burkes, the French the Horizons and the Chinese their Luyangs. So its really a question of which nationality does one belong.</p>

              <p>There are the Bedoks which are specialist vessels.</p>
              <p>Whatever anyone wants, the Formidables are already in service. As to air defence, that's the domain of the RSAF.</p>
              <p>Agree about the trend though. The LCS is an example of modular fits which goes a step further as in you only carry what you need based on the intended role. So its not really multi-role but changeable roles.</p>

              <p>There are the Bedoks which are specialist vessels.</p>
              <p>Whatever anyone wants, the Formidables are already in service. As to air defence, that's the domain of the RSAF.</p>
              <p>Agree about the trend though. The LCS is an example of modular fits which goes a step further as in you only carry what you need based on the intended role. So its not really multi-role but changeable roles.</p>

              <p><br>Bedoks are kinda rather low tech for what they are intended to do.</p>
              <p>At the very far end you'd have the US ocean surveillance vessels. Sure they don't have any weapons, but with some networking, you could do some really nifty work.</p>

              <p>He means you got two functions mixed up. Anti-ship missiles often can't be used in air-defence, so saying that a ship has weak air defences because it can't kill ships is... a jump in logic that most of us don't seem to get.</p>

              <p>This was not what you said.</p>
              <p>"Little anti-ship capability. Will not survive a sustained ASh Missile attack"</p>
              <p>This was the original. A ship with little anti-ship capability will not survive a sustained AShM attack. Which is actually the opposite, a dedicated AA ship will actually have a BETTER chance to survive than a generalised design.</p>
              <p>And storywolf has a point. :)</p>

              <p>Every ship has a limited number of missiles + ammo, even an air defence ship. Launch enough bombs at it and something will hit.</p>
              <p>That's why F15 &amp; F16s have an advantage. Can launch simultaneous multiple attacks on same or differing targets at one go.</p>
              <p>Every F-15SG can carry 12 to 15 cheap GBU-54s which can track moving target up to 110km/h (60 knots). Way faster than most ships can move. 2 or 3 F-15 sorties can probably kill almost any vessel in this region if it can get within range to launch the GBUs. Air power still has an advantage.</p>
              <p>More expensive ships like the burkes have XXXkm ranged missiles that can target aircraft at extremely long range. But of course, whether can detect aircraft at XXXkm is another issue. Some air forces have capability to launch X,XXXkm ranged missiles as well.</p>

              <p>weasel, so true, but GBUs have a big flaw. They are mostly gravity bombs, which mean you have to get in  very close, and it might be better not to have a 100M dollar (F-35 price range) fighter close in to such a range a $15,000 SAM can kill it.</p>
              <p>The more traditional way to settle this is to fire long ranged anti-ship missiles like Harpoons or Exocets from far away in huge numbers and let them swarm the ship. Less costly than losing a plane and pilot by 100x (1 Harpoon = 1M +/-, 1 F-35 = 100M- see wiki for cost comparison)</p>
