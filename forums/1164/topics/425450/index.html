              <p>I'm embarassed to say I actually googled it and came up with this:</p>
              <p>Designed to counter high-speed, high-altitude <em>anti</em>-<em>ship</em> cruise missiles.</p>
              <p>Underpaid, it's a joke. If it has to be a cruiser, then technically carriers qualify under the Russian definition.</p>
              <p>Anyway, if we consider the Burke class then we have to bring in the KDX-III, which has 16 fewer Mk41 cells but 32 more K-VLS cells for cruise missiles and VLS ASROC (meaning an overall 16 more Mk41 cells available for air defence, ie potentially 64 more ESSMs).</p>
              <p>It even has a RAM launcher for point defence, but that shouldn't count towards it being an "air defence ship".</p>

              <p>Standard missiles have been fired as AShM during the 1980s.</p>

              <p>Hot shit! The Standard was fired by a frigate, meaning to say with the retired Separate Target Illumination Radar that went out when SM-1 was taken off the US Perry class. It might not be possible on Aegis ships.</p>
              <p>There's still hope that other Perry class operators will do this someday.</p>
              <p>PS Tomahawks work in anti ship mode in place of Harpoons.</p>

              <p>The US Navy has removed all Harpoons from Perry Frigates.</p>
              <p>yes , Tomahawk missiles have AS capbility but I dont think the variant is in massive production or stored on US Warships. An since it is a cruise missile it will have a diff flight path from say a Harpoon.</p>
              <p>I think the US Navy has been over complacement with regards to its weaponary while  powers like China have a well balanced load onboard--check out the weapons on the PLAN ships for example.</p>

              <p>Exactly. No US ASMs are even supersonic.</p>
              <p>It bothers me that they are too politically correct to call the PLAN a threat as they see it. Or go straight to using an SSBN. That's the best air defence ship. Powers who don't play ball should know what its like to have a Trident up their a**.</p>

              <p>An SSBN or ICBM will never be used by the West. Thier political decision making will debate over the whole issue for days before deciding it.</p>

              <p>And according to Clancy, America has attacked India, Russia, China and Japan. Should we declare the US to be the new Axis power? :)</p>
