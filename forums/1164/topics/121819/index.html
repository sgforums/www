            <div class='col-md body'>Yes,it is scrapped but there is an exhibit in the Asian Aerospace 2004. I saw the video at the exhibit,very impressive,so i think SAF should give it some serious consideration.I think it is a very bad idea for the US to scrapped the M8. But they seem to have solved this problem with the MGS(Mobile Gun System)variant of the Styker. It is the most heavily armed variant,it have a 105mm main gun,7.62 and .50-calibre machine guns. But I think it still can't be considered as a true blue light tank.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"></div>

The turrets for the Bionix 25 transferred to the Ultra 40/50(possible?). The 40/50 turrets goes to modified Landrovers, Unimogs or Rexton SUVs.<br><br>The SM-1s gets fitted with OWS/Typhoon and given a new role - recce if it's still 3G relevant.

            <div class='col-md body'>During WW 2 , the Germans used turrets from decommissioned tanks and fitted them onto concrete bunkers. Ended up as fixed gun emplacements. Which was not such a bad idea since at that time, there were no such thing as smart weapons (e.g. bunker busters or ATGW).<br><br>They were difficult to kill but easy to get close by infantry, because of the turret's limited all-round vision. However, you needed a shaped charge to kill the bunker.<br><br>If I 'm not mistaken, the idea of using turrets on bunkers was also adopted to a small degree by the Swiss and also the Syrians. But with ATGW and smart weapons, the idea of fixed gun emplacements is only good for limited situations.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>The Soviets have also done the same for their old tank turrets and even for their ex-battleship turrets! They turned them into weapons in stationary forteresses along their borders such as the one facing China. That happened in the Soviet era but not any more as these bunkers are obsolete. You can read about this in the Tom Clancy book;The Bear and The Dragon. (Btw the book is not up to standard,i prefer his old books much more,he seem to have lost his touch now.) <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"></div>
