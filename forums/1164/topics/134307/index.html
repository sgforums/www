Detect, See and Avoid (DSA) technology is vital if remotely piloted or autonomous aircraft are to be integrated into the airspace system shared with inhabited aircraft.<br><br>The latest round of flight tests, sponsored by NASA Dryden Flight Research Center under the Environmental Research Aircraft and Sensor Technology (ERAST) program, took place April 1-4 near Mojave, Calif.<br><br>Â“The goal of the test was to be able to make a decision based on radar data in enough lead time to maneuver the test aircraft to avoid a close encounter with the intruder aircraft,Â” said Glenn Hamilton, UAV subsystems project manager at NASA Dryden.<br><br>Proteus in flight over Southern California<br>Scaled CompositesÂ’ Proteus aircraft, with safety pilots on board but controlled from the ground like a true UAV, was repeatedly directed away from conflicting flight paths with a variety of aircraft, some of which did not emit any signals to show their positions in the sky. Central to this round of tests was the Amphitech OASys radar system mounted on the chin of the Proteus.<br><br>In all 20 scenarios flown, ProteusÂ’ ground operator was able to detect the presence of other aircraft that posed the potential for collisions, maneuvering the test aircraft to keep the intruding aircraft outside an imaginary 500-ft. bubble of safe airspace surrounding Proteus. The conflicting aircraft ranged greatly in speed, from a NASA F/A-18 high-speed jet to several types of general aviation aircraft and an unpowered sailplane. A hot-air balloon had been on the roster, but winds at Mojave precluded its use in this round of tests.<br></blockquote></div>

The blended-wing merges the body and wing to reduce weight and drag. The shape also lends itself to simplified manufacture. The production KillerBee will have only 3 airframe parts. All systems are accessible from a single panel. This patented Swift concept will reduce manufacturing costs to a minimum.<br><br>Another advantage of blending the body and wing is stiffness. Most of the wing is quite thick. This allows the KillerBee to fly at speeds far greater than its cruise speed. Why is this advantageous? This allows the KillerBee to be released from fast-flying aircraft. Other small aircraft need to be folded to avoid the stresses of high speed flight. The KillerBee doesnÂ’t need the expensive folding mechanism.</blockquote>fr <a href="http://www.swiftengineering.com/05Aerospace/KillerBee/KillerBee.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.swiftengineering.com/05Aerospace/KillerBee/KillerBee.htm</a><br>wait longer ,watch the motion picture</div>

Deliveries will consist of Transport, Armed Robotic Vehicle Â– Assault Light (ARV-A(L)) and Countermine variants, with final deliveries in spring 2011.<br>.............<br>The MULE/ARV-A(L), a 2.5-ton class vehicle for the FCS, offers an extraordinary capability that will support the U.S. Army's transformation to a lighter and more mobile fighting force. The vehicle's unique mobility will enable it to go everywhere the soldier can go and more. It will allow soldiers of the transformed Army to use technology to do the dull, dirty and dangerous jobs of the current forces, freeing them to focus on the success of their missions. It provides for future growth through spiral development and possesses an open architecture designed to take full advantage of the rapid evolution of technology.<br><br>The MULE/ARV-A(L)'s highly mobile platform is a unique, highly advanced 6x6 independent articulated suspension. Coupled with in-hub motors powering each wheel, the suspension system provides extreme mobility in complex terrain, far exceeding that of vehicles utilizing more conventional suspension systems.<br><br>It will climb at least a 1-meter step and provides the vehicle with the mobility performance and surefootedness required to safely follow dismounted troops over rough terrain, through rock and debris fields and over urban rubble. This technology also allows the vehicle to cross 1-meter gaps, traverse side slopes greater than 40 percent, ford water to depths over 0.5 meters and overpass obstacles as high as 0.5 meters, while compensating for varying payload weights and center of gravity locations.<br><br>The Transport MULE configuration is designed to support the Future Force soldier by providing the volume and payload capacity to carry the equipment and supplies to support two dismounted Infantry Squads. Multiple tie-down points and removable/foldable side railings will support virtually any payload variation. It is suited to support casualty evacuation needs as well.<br><br>The ARV-A(L) version will be armed with a line-of-sight gun and an anti-tank capability. It is designed to provide immediate, heavy firepower to the dismounted soldier.<br><br>The Countermine variant is designed to provide detection and neutralization of mines, and marking of cleared lanes through minefields, greatly increasing the safety and mobility of the infantryman........... </blockquote>fr <a href="http://www.missilesandfirecontrol.com/our_news/pressreleases/05pressrelease/062205_MULE.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.missilesandfirecontrol.com/our_news/pressreleases/05pressrelease/062205_MULE.htm</a><br><br><img src="http://www.missilesandfirecontrol.com/our_products/groundvehiclesystems/MULE/images/MULE_med.jpg"><br><a href="http://www.missilesandfirecontrol.com/our_products/groundvehiclesystems/MULE/product-mule.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.missilesandfirecontrol.com/our_products/groundvehiclesystems/MULE/product-mule.html</a><br><br></div>

As the shape parameters of the falling object can be modified, the trajectory of the object in the fluid can be controlled. The RoboGlider thus travels underwater through the change of its critical dimensions, e.g., its length, under the influence of gravity.<br><br><img src="http://www.ntu.edu.sg/mae/Research/Programmes/IMR/SRP-robot3.jpg"><br>Robo-eel - This is hyperredundant underwater robot, or multi-DOF snake like underwater robot inspired by the swimming of eels. The robots use undulatory movement to swim in the water. The objective is to study the locomotion pattern of the robotic eels. The robots are built using a set of water-proof RC servo motor gears, including water-proof RC servo, rechargeable battery boxes, RC transceiver boxes, wiring, etc designed by Prof. Francis Nickols.</div>

The unmanned vehicle can move up to four times faster and still find the shortest path between two locations intelligently. This is a project at the Intelligent Systems Centre, jointly set up by NTU and ST Engineering, which was officially opened yesterday. This was the second tie-up between NTU and <strong>ST Engineering, after the setup of Laboratory of Advanced and Intelligent Mechatronics in 2000.</strong><br><br>fr <a href="http://www.ntu.edu.sg/CorpComms/NTU+in+the+News/Apr+-+Jun+05/" rel="nofollow">http://www.ntu.edu.sg/CorpComms/NTU+in+the+News/Apr+-+Jun+05/</a><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>The military application of  Biomimetic robots reflects from the backgrounds of two authors.One from DAPRA and other from Offive of Naval Research.<br><blockquote>Neurotechnology for Biomimetic Robots<br>Edited by Joseph Ayers, Joel L. Davis and Alan Rudolph<br><br>The goal of neurotechnology is to confer the performance advantages of animal systems on robotic machines. Biomimetic robots differ from traditional robots in that they are agile, relatively cheap, and able to deal with real-world environments. The engineering of these robots requires a thorough understanding of the biological systems on which they are based, at both the biomechanical and physiological levels.<br><br>This book provides an in-depth overview of the field. The areas covered include myomorphic actuators, which mimic muscle action; neuromorphic sensors, which, like animal sensors, represent sensory modalities such as light, pressure, and motion in a labeled-line code; biomimetic controllers, based on the relatively simple control systems of invertebrate animals; and the autonomous behaviors that are based on an animalÂ’s selection of behaviors from a species-specific behavioral "library." The ultimate goal is to develop a truly autonomous robot, one able to navigate and interact with its environment solely on the basis of sensory feedback without prompting from a human operator.<br><br>Joseph Ayers is Director of the Marine Science Center and Associate Professor of Biology at Northeastern University.<br><br>Joel L. Davis is Program Officer, Cognitive, Neural, and Biomolecular Science and Technology Division, Office of Naval Research.<br><br>Alan Rudolph is Program Manager in the Defense Sciences Office at DARPA, the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency. </blockquote>fr <a href="http://mitpress.mit.edu/catalog/item/default.asp?sid=C1F6ACBD-2D8E-4BF6-B642-FCCBB139068A&amp;ttype=2&amp;tid=8812" rel="nofollow">http://mitpress.mit.edu/catalog/item/default.asp?sid=C1F6ACBD-2D8E-4BF6-B642-FCCBB139068A&amp;ttype=2&amp;tid=8812</a><br><br>2.It is nice we are doing the same thing!!<br><br><img src="http://www.neurotechnology.neu.edu/images/newundulator.jpg"><br><a href="http://www.neurotechnology.neu.edu/" rel="nofollow">http://www.neurotechnology.neu.edu/</a></div>
