            <div class='col-md body'>As the reality of war becomes closer, there is this sense of helplessness and resignation.<br><br>For one, I am pro-war in this situation but I am not here to propogate why I take that stand.<br><br>I just feel that whether you are pro-war or  against war, we can never fully justify the stand we take.<br><br>I mean it is so easy for me to rattle off the reasons to support the war, but have I took time to think about the family of those us and uk soldiers going to war? Have I took time to think abt the innocent Iraqi people?<br><br>It is also easy for people to demonstrate against the war with plenty of reasons. But have they took time to think about by demonstrating for people in Iraq, why then did no one demonstrate in front of a Iraqi commission of such scale as now when Iraq invades Kuwait? If Iraq was let off and decides to do another 'Kuwait' or even worse, what will these demonstrators say then?<br><br>Whatever, it is, I just think it is silly for us common people to take a stand in this situation. Because, it is a lose-lose situation.<br><br>I think, lets just do our part. For those who believe in God, pray. For those who can able, serve your own community. I guess we just  need to do our part well because sometimes it is just so easy to take a stand because it doesnt hurt us.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>If there is so much "Anti-War" feelings that poured out into demonstrations against the very possible US-UK led War Against IRAQ to Dis-Arm; then there should also be a corresponding demonstration in earnest, to push Saddam Hussein to stop playing his "game of brinkmanship" to hide his inaccurate accounting of the various stockpiles of WMD products, and prolonging the agony of dis-arming Iraq of all WMD products since 1992.<br><br>The "Food For Oil" Exchange Program has been on-going since 1997, and the vast amount of oil from Iraq has stabilised the oil prices of the world.<br><br>This money that has been received from the UN supervised sale of Iraqi Oil, has purchased a large amount of food and medicines for the Iraqi people.<br><br>However, the Iraqi propaganda continue to show the sick, the dying, and the malnutritioned young and old that is blamed on the continued US-UK led sanctions.<br><br>Somehow, the balance report do not show the continued enforced starvation of the various tribes of Iraq - as sanctioned by Saddam; just because these tribes are different from the main tribe that Saddam Hussein belonged to, and which form the dominating Ba'ath Party.<br><br>If sympathy has to be shown, it is to the innocent civilians, and the soldiers on both sides that have to do the bidding of their political masters.<br><br>If contempt has to be shown, it will largely have to be thrown at Saddam Hussein for his continued display of contempt towards the UNITED NATIONS and the various rulings that require IRAQ to dis-arm itself of all Weapons of Mass Destruction.<br><br>Saddam Hussein has continued to play a game of "Hide-and-Seek" with the secretive movement and storage of his chemical and biological weapons from the UN Inspectors, who are hopelessly trying their best to verify the deliberate inaccurate Iraqi accounting of these stocks of WMD products.<br><br>Contempt has also to be thrown at the French for their egoistic attempts to up-stage the Americans, in the idiotic French approach of appeasement towards an obviously dishonest Saddam.<br><br>Contempt has to be shown towards the various Permanent Members of the Security Council, for their inability to get their act together, and allow Saddam Hussein to drive a wedge amongst them, and so buy time for himself to hide and further develop his WMD program, while the inaccurate accounting of WMD Stocks continue to occupy and befuddle the UN Inspectors.<br><br>Meanwhile, the economies of the world hover as each day unfold, with the prospects of war slowing down the already battered World economies into further uncertainties.<br><br></div>

Resolution<br>1 hour, 45 minutes ago<br><br>By RON FOURNIER, AP White House Correspondent<br><br>WASHINGTON - Forced into a diplomatic retreat, U.S. officials said Thursday that President Bush (news - web sites) may delay a vote on his troubled U.N. resolution or even drop it Â— and fight Iraq (news - web sites) without the international body's backing. France dismissed a compromise plan as an "automatic recourse to war."<br><br>Amid a swirl of recrimination and 11th-hour posturing, the White House began planning for a possible overseas meeting this weekend between President Bush and his two staunchest allies on Iraq, British Prime Mininster Tony Blair (news - web sites) and Spanish Prime Minister Jose Maria Aznar.<br><br>Senior U.S. officials said the meeting, tentatively planned for a neutral nation overseas, would allow the leaders to review final diplomatic and military strategies. The officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said all three leaders and the host nation had not signed off on the summit Thursday night, and there would be no final word on the prospects for a meeting before Friday.<br><br>News of the meeting first surfaced Thursday morning, but officials said planning had stopped only to confirm hours later that talks had begun again. Early in the day, U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan (news - web sites) raised the possibility of a global summit "to get us out of this crisis."<br><br>The government of Iraqi President Saddam Hussein (news - web sites) exulted in the diplomatic tumult over a U.S.-British backed resolution that would demand that Iraq disarm by Monday. The allies "have lost the round before it starts while we, along with well-intentioned powers in the world, have won it," the popular daily Babil, owned by Iraqi President Saddam Hussein's son, Odai, said in a front-page editorial.<br><br>Bush spent a fourth day on the telephone, consulting leaders of Britain, Bulgaria, South Korea (news - web sites), Poland, El Salvador (news - web sites) and Norway.<br><br>The U.S. diplomatic drive was centered on Chile and Mexico, both members of the U.N. Security Council, a senior administration official said. Their support would ensure the United States of the minimum nine votes need for adoption of the resolution.<br><br>But France's threat to veto is taken seriously, and the administration may decide not to give France the chance by withdrawing the resolution, the official said on condition of anonymity. Bush was ready to drop the resolution, several aides said, if British Prime Minister Tony Blair didn't want it put to a vote.<br><br>The president has pushed for a U.N. vote thus far out of respect for Blair, whose support of Bush has drawn severe criticism in Britain.<br><br>Trouble loomed at every diplomatic turn.<br><br>Irish Prime Minister Bertie Ahern, visiting Bush at the White House, said, "If there is not a resolution, Ireland cannot engage in support of military action, because we work under the U.N. resolution."<br><br>Bush sent a letter to incoming Turkish Premier Recep Tayyip Erdogan and Vice President Dick Cheney (news - web sites) called the leader in hopes of securing permission to invade Iraq through Turkey. Hours later, Navy ships armed with Tomahawk missiles were told to move out of the Mediterranean into the Red Sea, a move that indicates weakening U.S. confidence that Turkey will grant overflight rights for U.S. planes and missiles.<br><br>In Baghdad, the Iraqi government rejected a British compromise plan that would list six disarmament requirements Baghdad would have to meet or else face "serious consequences." Bush had signaled he would be willing to push back the March 17 deadline seven or 10 days if the gesture would help Blair.<br><br>Russia said it would consider the plan. China said it doubted the plan could lead to consensus.<br><br>The French dismissed the effort outright, sparking a trans-Atlantic shouting match.<br><br>"We cannot accept the British proposals insofar as they are part of a logic of war, a logic of automatic recourse to war," said French Foreign Minister Dominique de Villepin.<br><br>White House press secretary Ari Fleischer (news - web sites) said of France: "They rejected it before Iraq rejected it. If that isn't an unreasonable veto, what is?"<br><br>Bush, meanwhile, backpedaled on his pledge to have a U.N. vote by Friday. Fleischer told reporters a tally could slip beyond the weekend.<br><br>Several top administration officials said a growing number of advisers believe the resolution is doomed and they want the president to cut his losses and withdraw it. Others still hold out hope for the measure.<br><br>The officials, all of whom spoke on condition of anonymity, agreed that a key is whether Blair wants Bush to give diplomacy more time.<br><br>Bush and his advisers debated Thursday whether to press forward with the vote or withdraw the measure and pivot quickly to war footing. Bush has long planned to address the nation shortly after the U.N. debate is resolved and give Saddam a final ultimatum, perhaps including a deadline, for war.<br><br>"We are still talking to members of the council to see what is possible," Secretary of State Colin Powell (news - web sites) said. "The options remain, go for a vote and see what members say or not go for a vote."<br><br>That's a change of policy since last week, when Bush said he wanted U.N. members to "show their cards" even if that meant the measure failed.<br><br>The U.S. ambassador to the United Nations (news - web sites), John Negroponte, didn't call for a vote Friday and diplomats doubted one would be called for Saturday.<br><br>In London, Iain Duncan Smith, leader of the opposition Conservative Party, emerged from a meeting with Blair to say the prime minister believed war was more likely because "the French have become completely intransigent."<br><br>Powell, testifying on Capitol Hill, said the "day of reckoning is fast approaching" for Iraq.<br><br></div>
