During this war(1990 Gulf war) my tank became my enemy ... none of my troops would get near a tank at night because they just kept blowing up.''<br><br>These exchanges illustrate another aspect of precision air war, particularly as it applies to the direct attack of enemy forces: What can be identified can be targeted so precisely that unnecessary casualties are not inflicted upon an opponent. In short, war, the great waster of human life, is now significantly more humane. <strong>Increasingly, war is more about destroying or<br>incapacitating things as opposed to people. It is now about pursuing an effects-based strategy, rather than an annihilation-based strategy,<br>a strategy that one can control an opponent without having to destroy him.<br></strong></blockquote><br><blockquote>Combined statistics of American and NATO experience indicate that the average number of precision weapons per designated mean point of impact (DMPI) destroyed was 2.8. In contrast, the average number of Â‘dumbÂ’ general purpose bombs per DMPI destroyed was 6.6. The average number of attack sorties per DMPI destroyed was 1.5.</blockquote><strong>Precision Attack versus Light Infantry</strong><br><blockquote>A scenario by<a href="http://www.rand.org/" rel="nofollow"><strong>the RAND Corporation</strong></a><strong><br></strong>details one possible mission against guerrillas moving heavy weapons by vehicle where many of these detection technologies might synergistically come into play:<br><a href="http://search.yahoo.com/search?p=JSTARS&amp;prssweb=Search&amp;ei=UTF-8&amp;fr=FP-tab-web-t&amp;fl=0&amp;x=wrtl" rel="nofollow">'The <strong>JSTARS </strong></a><strong>  </strong> crew are directed to look for vehicle traffic along several roads. During its mission, the JSTARSÂ’ Moving Target Indicator radar detects suspicious vehicle traffic in the area of concern. This information is used to cue a UAV [Unmanned Air Vehicle] equipped with a FolPen [foliage-penetrating] radar and EO/IR [electro- optical/infrared] sensors. The UAV - using its thermal imager - detects and follows several trucks that appear to be carrying weapons. The trucks disappear into a wooded area. The UAV then uses its FolPen radar to follow the vehicles down the hidden road to an assembly area. Ground sensors are then dropped. Using acoustic and thermal imagers, remote operators are able to identify the personnel and vehicles as hostile. Tactical air (TACAIR) is called in to destroy the site.''<br></blockquote>My God!This is exactly what 3G SAF is looking for!<br><br><blockquote>In the Gulf War, for example, the total cost of the approximately 2,000 tons of laser-guided bombs dropped by the F-117A force was roughly $146 million; that same tonnage in Tomahawk Land Attack cruise missiles would have been $4.8 billion.</blockquote>Click the end of sentence in orginial to see any note u can refer to in the end of paper.<br><br>So,the more precisive the weapons,the more humane!?</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Inch for inch, Singapore is easily the most heavily defended place on planet earth.<br><br>Don't you agree?<br><br>Maybe even the Korean peninsula DMZ is not as heavily defended - and they're technically still at war.<br><br>So it is really hard to say what else we still need.

            <div class='col-md body'>You know what the SAF needs? Forget the uber-powerful death star killing plasma cannons! It needs more motorcycle helmets!<br><br>There is a serious lack of helmets that actually fit. Most riders have to wear a cap under the helmet because SAF stocks large quatities of size L...and not much else.<br><br>In the SAF driving school, most of the helmets are very very old... I am sure everyone of them have been in an accident before. The thing with helmets is that its structure is designed to degrade upon impact. This means that even if the helmet looks fine on the outside, its structural integrity might already have been compromised. This applies also to the helmets issued in units.<br><br>The helmet should be an issued item. Once issued, its yours. If you lose it/damage it within 3 years ++, then you will have pay to get a new one. Instead of spending money on swanky new PT singlets(! What a bloody waste of money), how bout the SAF start spending money where it really matters.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by Delta 5:</div><div class="quote_body">The Bronco ATTC comes in many versions... i.e. troop transport, resupply, ammunition carrier, ambulance, radar carrier... In this respect it can be regarded as the workhorse of the SAF ground units, the equal of the Russian MTLB which is also used for a wide variety of roles. However, the Bronco is articulated while the MTLB uses a conventional tracked AFV layout.<br><br>It is definately not a replacement for the various army trucks in service, but to supplement the mechanised infantry units. According to Jane's defence Weekly as many as 500 Broncos may be built by 2008.</div></blockquote>Yes , it was reported or rather estimated by analyst that we will have abt 500 armoured Bronco.<br><br>As for it's use, and due to large number, I once said it is quick transport for infantry Bde so that they could be transported to the frontline with speed and protection.<br><br>And some of them I believe will be use for logistics, afterall we did see a open top re-supply logistic version of Bronco during NDP.<br><br>It is of course not able to replace the large truck or flatbed that we have, even the US have since Jessica Lynch case have uparmoured their Humvees and truck with additional amoured plating and that I believe could easily be done by ST if needed.<br><br>As for APC/IFVs we have plenty of them for mechanised/armoured forces, I mean it is reported to be at least 720 M113s, and some even estimated to be abt above 1000 and the Bionix is at least 300+ and some even reported to be abt 500, so have  at least 1,100 to 1500 APC/IFVs ( that is already excluded our wheeled V-150/200s) , so we already have the largest fleet of APC/IFVs in SEA!!!<br><br>So does our mechanised/armoured force need the Bronco for such role, I will say no, so I only can think of is that it is mainly for troop transport for our infantry and logistic resupply.</div>
