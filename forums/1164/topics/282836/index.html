            <div class='col-md body'>Just curious why there is no formation badge for 21 Div.  I can understand for 25 Div as that is a 100% reservist division.  But 21 Div is active.  And since 3, 6 &amp; 9 Divs have their badges, why not 21 Div?<br><br>Also, how do they decide which formation badge to use?  For e.g. my friend's in a NS infantry unit.  But his badge is not Infantry, its 2 PDF.  So take 30 SCE for e.g.  Since they are under 3 Div, will their badge be 3 Div or SCE?<br><br>Not that it matter lah, just curious.</div>
