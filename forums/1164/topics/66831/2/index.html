            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by tripwire:</div><div class="quote_body">i would have thought that your previous sentence was in reference to present time rather then the situation 8 years ago or more...<br><br>frankly... we all knows that the RSN has been on the last in line for any budget for a good few decades... i still remember the time when we only have 6 MGBs to be "proud" of... so to speak...<br><br>there was once a time i remeber that PM GCT actually said in a public speech that given the choice between a fighter and a ship... he would go for the fighter as they are cheaper and something blah blah blah... cant remember them...<br><br></div></blockquote>Well, a few exercises with the USN, Indian Navy and the RAN, and "sinking" of RSN so many times, soon made RSN and General Chief of Staff realised that if RSN had to fight a war, there will be no more ships within the first week, or even the first 3 days....<br><br>Thus, the sudden emphasis on AAW and ASW warfare. No more ya ya. Even a lousy post WW2 sub would be able to sink the MCVs if properly deployed and used. Thus now RSN has the 5 dedicated ASW PVs, and the new Formidable class are armed to the teeth for both ASW and AAW.  The purchase of the Soojmen is also to rectify the fact that RSN didn't have a sub force for it to horn its ASW skills. Of course, having good enuff hand-me-down subs also provides RSN and instant sub surface offensive power to threaten any sub surface and surface unfriendlies.<br><br>Getting a new fleet (4 ships) of submarine, (A19 or U212) is going to provide the edge RSN has never enjoyed before. (side comment: I like the Dolphins too.) Strengthening both AAW and ASW capability should continue to be an ongoing event until RSN can hold its own against experience Navies like the USN, RAN and Indian Navy in joint exercises.<br><br>I would hope the following things to happen for RSN:<br>1. purchase a decent helo for the Formidable frigates, ie, either the Seahawk or NH90(still my perference). Immediate.<br><br>2. upgrade the MPAs with anti-sub capabilites. Eg. add sonabuoys capability, plus any other detection devices such as a magnetic anomoly detector, a hyper sensitive IR detector, a SIGINT/ELINT to detect any surface and surface communications. Around 2006<br><br>3a. upgrade the sub surface force with 4 new advanced SSK. A19, U212, Dolphin or a Sorpene variant. Build 3 locally by ST Marine.<br>AIP or Fuel cell could be added advantage RSN should consider. Retained 1 current RSS Challenger class sub for training and convert 1 into a commando insertion sub. Around 2010<br><br>3b. purchase and build locally in ST Marine (in preparation for building the larger SSK - see point 3a above)  mini subs for NDU insertion and minelaying. Also use mini subs to defend "choke points".  An example of minisubs I am thinking of is the Russian P-130 or Piranha-T Small-class submarine. Around 2008 to 2012<br><img src="http://www.rusarm.ru/images/sm_sub.jpg"><br>See:<br><a href="http://www.milparade.com/2001/44/02_02.shtml" rel="nofollow">http://www.milparade.com/2001/44/02_02.shtml</a><br><a href="http://www.rusarm.ru/products/navy/small.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.rusarm.ru/products/navy/small.htm</a><br><br>4. Design and build a "modified  and stretched Endurance class LST" (and call it whatever we want) into a Helicopter assult ship (note: Not carrier). A LHD would act as a command ship for ASW operation and any amphibious/assault operation. Around 2008-2012.<br><br>5. Add a new anti-surface missile into the infantry. Something like the Norwegian NSM. Upgrade MCV hard-kill and soft kill options. Add a torpedo decoys to the MCVs. Around 2005 to 2007<br><br>6. Introduce a locally design stealth OPV/Covette to replace the PVs. The PVs are then transferred to PCGs or sell to a third country. Post 2012<br><br>Just my 2.2 cents<br></div>

The Swedish Navy has conducted the entire training program, which has been carried out in several stages.<br><br>Only a few ships in the world are capable of carrying such a massive cargo. The voyage to Singapore will take about a month. Each submarine weighs about 1,100 tons. Two modernized submarines in the same class, Conqueror and Chieftain, already await the arrival of their sister vessels in Singapore.

            <div class='col-md body'>Perhaps a point that should be considered in the debate of the combat effectiveness of the Lekiu class frigate is its sensor-weapon fit. As many of you may know, the Malaysian Armed Forces has an acquisition policy which sources from no single defence contractor. The Lekiu class sensors and weapon systems come from a number of European defence contractors and this caused a major delay in the launch and commissioning of the Lekiu class (over 3 years) because of integration problems.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I do believe that RSN has a long way to go before it reaches the capability of the RSAF or even the Army. As others have said, it is not a secret that it was usually last in line for funding for most of the last 2 decades. Compared to its regional counterparts, it is rather lacking, especially considering its responsibilities. While the RSAF multiplies the power of our ships, you still need hulls in the water to exert sea control.<br><br>I think that this is changing, however. I think that planners have realized how vulnerable Singapore is to naval blockade, and how inadequate our forces currently are to break such a blockade. Also, the threat of maritime piracy and terrorism, while mostly the responsibility of the Coast Guard to deal with, also calls for greater naval power.<br><br>Even after we acquire the new Formidable class frigates, we still need more. Given our limited funds, I do not think that submarines are a good idea for us. They are too much of a one trick pony for too high a price, and the shallow waters of the region limit them even further. We should focus on obtaining more surface platforms similar to the Formidable and integrate them with our aerial and underwater UAVs and satellite reconnaisance capability. Joint operations with the RSAF should be emphasized and honed to perfection.</div>
