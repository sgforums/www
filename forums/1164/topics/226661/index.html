Engineers at the McDonnell Douglas subsidiary of the Boeing Co. in St. Louis are starting tests to integrate the GBU-39 Small Diameter Bomb on the U.S. Air Force F/A-22 fighter bomber, as well as on the Block 30, 40, and 50 variants of the F-16 jet fighter.<br><br>Today the 250-pound smart bomb is fitted to the F-15E fighter bomber. The F/A-22 currently can carry only 1,000 pound Joint Direct Attack Munition (JDAM) bombs, but eventually will be able to carry eight Small Diameter Bombs.<br><br>Eventually Air Force experts plan to equip the B-2 long-range strategic bomber to carry as many as 216 Small Diameter Bombs on each mission.<br><br>McDonnell Douglas is doing the Small Diameter Bomb test work under terms of a $13 million contract modification awarded Dec. 15. The contract came from the Air Force 308th Armament Systems Wing at Eglin Air Force Base, Fla.<br><br>The contract calls for McDonnell Douglas to provide test assets in support of aircraft and weapon integration of the Small Diameter Bomb on the F-16 Block 30, F-16 Block 40/50, F-22A, and maintain interoperability on the F-15E. The company also will test the universal armament interface for the Small Diameter Bomber II program. Work will be in St. Louis, and is to be finished in August 2008.<br><br>GBU-39 variant of the Small Diameter Bomb has guidance from the satellite Global Positioning System (GPS), as well as from an inertial gyro. The future GBU-40 variant will have a terminal seeker with automatic target recognition capabilities for mobile and relocatable targets.<br><br>The bomb measures 5.9 feet long and weighs 285 pounds, and is to increases the number of weapons an aircraft can carry, as well as reduce collateral damage. The bomb has a range of more than 60 miles, and can operate in bad weather.<br><br>The weapon was first deployed with the U.S. Air Force last year.<br><br><a href="http://mae.pennnet.com/display_article/280124/32/NEWS/none/none/Boeing-starts-tests-to-integrate-Small-Diameter-Bomb-on-F-22,-F-16-jet-fighter-bombers" rel="nofollow">http://mae.pennnet.com/display_article/280124/32/NEWS/none/none/Boeing-starts-tests-to-integrate-Small-Diameter-Bomb-on-F-22,-F-16-jet-fighter-bombers</a><br><br><strong>Boeing Receives First Small Diameter Bomb Full-Rate Production Order from U.S. Air Force</strong><br><br>ST. LOUIS, Dec. 19, 2006 -- Boeing [NYSE: BA] has been awarded an $80 million U.S. Air Force full-rate production contract for the Small Diameter Bomb I (SDB I) system.<br><br>The order calls for Boeing to deliver 1,600 weapons, 300 carriages and other equipment to the Air Force by 2008. This is the first full-rate production contract for the SDB I system.<br><br>Boeing will manufacture more than 24,000 SDB I weapons and 2,000 carriages for the Air Force, with deliveries planned beyond 2015.<br><br>The SDB I weapon system, which includes a four-bomb capacity pneumatic carriage, is the first of a new generation of weapons whose small size and robust performance greatly increase mission capability while reducing collateral damage in the target area.<br><br>"This action by the Air Force is the culmination of a gratifying last few months for the SDB team," said Boeing SDB Program Manager Dan Jaspering. "Not only was the weapon system declared operational on schedule, it also was successfully deployed in combat. Now, with a strong vote of confidence from our customer, the first full-rate production contract has been awarded."<br><br>An all-weather, 250-pound class weapon system, SDB I quadruples the number of weapons each aircraft can carry. At 71-inches long and with a standoff range of 60 nautical miles, the weapon is compatible with every U.S. fighter and bomber aircraft.<br><br>Boeing builds the GBU-39 weapon at its lean manufacturing facility in St. Charles, Mo. Sargent Fletcher, Inc., of El Monte, Calif., builds the BRU-61 carriages.<br><br><a href="http://www.boeing.com/news/releases/2006/q4/061219a_nr.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.boeing.com/news/releases/2006/q4/061219a_nr.html</a><br><br>Small diameter bombs for our F-16C/Ds?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"><br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>We can also carry it on our F-15s since the USAF currently deploys the SDB on their F-15E Strike Eagles .<br>Four GBU-39/Bs can be carried on a single station by using the BRU-61/A four-store rack and the strike eagle can carry the rack on 5 weapons station, giving a total of 20 SDBs, which is a very impressive load.<br><br></div>
