            <div class='col-md body'>no matter what the reason, children are innocent.<br><br>They are defenceless. they have not offended anyone.<br><br>These actions are cowardly, and of desperation.<br><br>It is sad that we are witnessing the begining of the end of a religon. Like the Astec, Egyptians, I think the religion will slowly fad away over the next 100 years.<br><br>Guess the turing point is when a alternative fuel is found and the Arabs will loose it's power on the world. The world will then turn against them who have caused fear and pain to many.<br><br>Sad, but like Einstien theory,<br><br>Every cause will have an effect.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>At the risk of sounding cold, children of today are no innocent then that of their older sibilings.  Haven't anyone read about the gang of primary school student who gang rape a woman( Not, in S'pore lah )? Or seen pictures of a kid holding an AK-47 possing for National Geography?  Or the local flavour of gang fights with parangs? etc, etc, etc.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mad.gif" alt="Mad" title="Mad"><br><br>Maybe like the law, we chose to ignore the fact that children are not ignorant to death that in fact the kid who brought the gun to school to shoot his school mates knew that they would die by his actions.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cry.gif" alt="Crying or Very sad" title="Crying or Very sad"><br><br>The terrorist action in the Russian school was wronged, condamning it is a right thing to do, preventing future terrorist from doing it is a must, etc.  But claiming that these terrorist act was worst then any previous terrorist  because of the involvement of innocent children, is wrong.<br><br>Because we have alway believed that children are innocent thats why the terrorist would use them to terrorize us because of the emotional impact that come with their actions.  To fight terrorism, we must be prepared for the worst, this include seeing a kid with bomb strapped to his body.  Because the kid could've volunteered for the job.</div>
