            <div class='col-md body'>Heres a statement, released on the 3rd anniversary of Sept 11 2001, by a group representing loved ones of those who died that day. Some food for thought.<br><br>==========================<br><br><a href="http://peacefultomorrows.org/#threeyearslater" rel="nofollow">http://peacefultomorrows.org/#threeyearslater</a><br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Three Years Later:<br>Peaceful Tomorrows 9/11/04 Statement</strong></span><br><br>Nearly three years ago, September 11th Families for Peaceful Tomorrows was born out of a shared belief that AmericaÂ’s military response to the 9/11 attacks which took our loved onesÂ’ lives would result in the deaths of countless innocent civilians and increase recruitment for terrorist causes, making the United States, and the world, less safe and less free for generations to come.<br><br>Today, as we commemorate September 11, 2004, we find that our worst fears have been realized. The terrorism of September 11th has been neither neutralized, nor ended, by the terrorism of war.<br><br>Since our bombing and military action in Afghanistan, resulting in the deaths of more than 130 American troops and an estimated 4,000 civilians Â– and compounded by our failure to rebuild that broken nation--we have seen the return of Taliban warlords, the departure of relief agencies, and the continuing deaths of American service people and innocent civilians. Afghan President Hamid Karzai has acknowledged that he is seeking the support of former Taliban officials in an effort to stabilize the political process. Osama bin Laden remains at large, and al-Qaeda remains a potent terrorist force, as evidenced by the March 11 train bombings in Madrid, Spain.<br><br>Our illegal, immoral and unjustified invasion of Iraq, a nation that had nothing to do with the September 11th attacks, has cost the lives of 1,000 American troops and an estimated 12,000 Iraqi civilians, while leaving tens of thousands of others physically and emotionally traumatized. Today, our continuing occupation, our failure to provide basic services like electricity and water, and our torture of prisoners at Abu Ghraib has turned Iraq into a focus of anti-American sentiment where a new generation of terrorists is being recruited from around the world.<br><br>In Guantanamo, approximately 600 detainees from 40 countries remain incarcerated without charge and without access to lawyers. Those who have been returned to their home countries attest to conditions that violate the Geneva Conventions and our own democratic principles. In America, the USA Patriot Act gives government free reign to surveil law-abiding citizens. Restrictions on peaceful protest mock our Constitutional guarantees of freedom of speech and assembly. Meanwhile, bias crimes and discrimination continue to cast a shadow over our nation.<br><br>That all of this has been done in the names of our loved ones who died on September 11th makes the suffering of their innocent counterparts around the world even harder to take. When actions that are making the world less secure are carried out in the name of US security, we must reconsider the true sources of the security, freedom, and respect we once commanded around the globe.<br><br>Is the source of our security and freedom the exercise of overwhelming military power? Have we found security and freedom by dividing the world into "us and them," and labeling entire nations "evil"? Three years ago, the French declared, "We are all Americans," and Iranians held spontaneous candlelight vigils for our dead. Today, American prestige is at an all-time low. Friend and foe alike tremble at the sense of exceptionalism that drives America to conduct pre-emptive war.<br><br>And what example have we set by our use of violence as a tool for addressing complex grievances? In the past week, heartbreaking pictures of children abducted and killed in Russia remind us that terrorism against civilian populations, which did not begin on September 11th, has not abated as a result of our actions since then. In Iraq, abductions of more than 40 civilians from nations including Japan, Jordan, Italy, China, Ukraine, South Korea, Egypt, Nepal, India, Kenya, the Philippines, Bulgaria and our own have escalated the level of human suffering.<br><br>On September 11th, 2002, we urged America to participate fully in the global community, by honoring international treaties, endorsing and participating in the International Criminal Court, following the United Nations charter, and agreeing in word and action to the precepts of international law. Today, we redouble our call for America to return to full membership in the community of nations.<br><br>We call for an end to war as our nation's one blunt instrument of foreign policy in our increasingly complex world. We recognize that our freedoms and security derive not from politicians or the Pentagon, but from our Constitution, and call on all Americans to rise in its defense against the triple threats of fear, lies and ignorance.<br><br>Finally, we draw hope from those around the globe whose historical experiences of terrorism and war have brought them not to a place of vengeance, but to a commitment to creating a peaceful world. They include victims of the violence in Israel and Palestine; families of victims of the Bali nightclub bombing; family members of those killed in Oklahoma City; atomic bomb survivors from Hiroshima and Nagasaki; those who survived the bombing of Guernica, Spain and Dresden, Germany; those affected by terrorism in Kenya; Cambodia; Chechnya; South Africa; Northern Ireland; Bosnia; Sri Lanka and elsewhere. Through their witness and their efforts towards reconciliation, they have demonstrated that peace begins in the heart of every individual, and that people united have an unparalleled power to change the world.<br><br>Every day, we choose to create the world we want to live in, through our words and through our actions. Today, we reach out to others around the world who recognize that war is not the answer. Today, three years after September 11th, we continue to choose peace.<br><br>--September 11th Families for Peaceful Tomorrows</div>

Look at it in this way, these madmen believe that even if you kill their families and loved ones, as 'good' Muslims, you are merely sending their families to paradise. You think its going to stop them? Think again. You're merely showing once again, how much you understand the enemy.<br><br><blockquote><strong><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="Arrow" title="Arrow"> this war aint over yet..... its too early for you to jump to conclusion....<br></strong></blockquote>Based on contemporary evidence, I'd say it is the likeliest one.<br><br>What I'm trying to say is, to beat the extremist lunatic fringe, we have to get the moderate Muslims into taking a more active stance against the terrorists. The current actions of those who claim to be fighting terror, especially those on it's own lunatic fringe like Tripwire, will only have the opposite effect.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I wonder if anyone heard of this new age terrorist known as part-time warriors?  Word has it that its the latest thing to do for those who have nothing better to do with their life.<br><br>These people volunteer their services to some terror groups which arrange for them to fly to whereever for about 2 weeks of weapon trainning &amp; so on.  Then the instructors would arrange for them an oppotunity to have a shoot out with the American troops.  After which they would leave the country &amp; fly back home as if they had went on a 6 months holiday.  Oh!  Some of these part-time warriors actually have to pay for their membership.  That is why you've been hearing news reporters referring to some of the terrorist as foreign terrorist &amp; not indentifying the terrorist for who they are &amp; where they come from.<br><br>I guess those so-called terrorist caught in S'pore can be considered as part-timers.  I mean that they do have a proper day job which pays them.  And their part in the terror plan did not include them taking any action.  And 1 or 2 of them even fly to Afghanistan for trainning, which makes me wonder why they need to fly all the way there when they could have learnt to shoot &amp; so on during their NS?<br><br></div>

SADDAM or USA? how many iraqis died in SADDAM reign? how many kurds got gas by iraqi military?<br><br>&gt;&gt;&gt; what have you done for the iraqis when their leaders went on a rampage killing innocent childrens? who are you to tell the americans that they are wrong when you didnt lift a finger to help the iraqis against SADDAM?<br><br>&gt;&gt;&gt; and the american failure in iraq.. IF YOU think you can run IRAQ better... why dont you offer your service? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green">  dont preach.... ACT!<br><br>i will answer the rest of your points later... gotta buy breakfast... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Talk about "Even a stopped clock is right twice a day". You've got that right, so why is it that the current attempts to beat the terrorists almost always entails brute military force?<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="Arrow" title="Arrow"> i think you misunderstood... what i wanna say is that war is multi-faceted and require coordination between various function of the state like economy, diplomacy and blah blah running in tandem with the military operation to achieve an outcome that is believe to be most favourable.<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="Arrow" title="Arrow"> the current attmept to beat the terrorist is NEVER one of pure brute military force... that would be naive and stupid....<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="Arrow" title="Arrow"> the war on terrorism is like any other war... and is fought on many many front across many nation around the world from the US president's office to the kopi tiem shop of singapore.... through diplomacy, economy, military, mass media, religion and even spies...<br><br>Ahhh...now we're back to the same old Tripwire we know and love. For a moment we thought we were losing you. My eye for an eye statement is not mean in the literal sense<br><br>Losing 2 eyes won't make both men blind, but it only serves to make them continue to try to take out the 2nd eye of their enemy.<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="Arrow" title="Arrow"> if so... that would be most unfortunate.... but i was of the opinion that once a man lost one eye... he will be fearful of loosing his other eye...<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="Arrow" title="Arrow"> when a man has 2 eyes... at times he doesnt appreciate the value of his eyes until he looses one of them...<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="Arrow" title="Arrow"> its equally an irony that the greatest value of peace is found at the deepest depth of war's horrors...<br><br>Whats the point of tit for tat in this case? Look at it in this way, these madmen believe that even if you kill their families and loved ones, as 'good' Muslims, you are merely sending their families to paradise. You think its going to stop them? Think again. You're merely showing once again, how much you understand the enemy.<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="Arrow" title="Arrow"> hahahaha..... sending them to paradise? that may be true for the moron foot soldiers who has been brain-washed by the "holy muallahs" with their unique crooked interpretation of the koran...<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="Arrow" title="Arrow"> but then... if their leaders believe in what they preach... why arent they the one carrying out the suicide attack and rush for heaven's door? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"><br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="Arrow" title="Arrow"> the fact that OBL, his lieutenants and other heads of various other terrorist organizations choose to hide, rather then DIE for their cause... clearly indicates that these terrorist leaders didnt want to go to heaven... they want something that can ONLY be found on earth.... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="Arrow" title="Arrow"> and they believe that through the ultimate sacrifice of their foolish followers... they are now on a path of absolute victory !(they just might win) <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br><br>Based on contemporary evidence, I'd say it is the likeliest one.<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="Arrow" title="Arrow"> one? which one? what one?<br><br>What I'm trying to say is, to beat the extremist lunatic fringe, we have to get the moderate Muslims into taking a more active stance against the terrorists. The current actions of those who claim to be fighting terror, especially those on it's own lunatic fringe like Tripwire, will only have the opposite effect.<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="Arrow" title="Arrow"> get the moderate muslims to take an active stance against terrorist?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_eek.gif" alt="Shocked" title="Shocked">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_eek.gif" alt="Shocked" title="Shocked"> GWB only hope that these moderates dont actively support those terrorist! <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="Arrow" title="Arrow"> sorry chap.. that day will never come.... since for islam... any muslim who raise his hands against a fellow brother means direct ticket to hell...<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="Arrow" title="Arrow"> and why would they raise their hands against those they believe are fighting to "RIGHT the INJUSTICE"?</div>
