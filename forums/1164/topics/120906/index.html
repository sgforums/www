We were provided with an option to upgrade or replace them. We chose the latter," he said.<br><br>He was speaking after attending the launching of the Northern Malaysia University College of Engineering's army reserve unit by the Regent of Perlis, Tuanku Syed Faizuddin Putra.<br><br>The US F-5E fighter jets are currently based at the Butterworth air base.<br><br>"There is nothing wrong with these aircraft. We are replacing them due to our military upgrading programme."<br><br>Zainal Abidin also said the jets would be replaced by the Russian Sukhoi Su-30 MKM Flanker fighter jets.<br><br>He added there was a RM3.42 billion (US$900 million) agreement with the Russian Government to supply Malaysia with 18 of these Sukhoi fighter jets.<br><br>The SU-30 MKM is due to be delivered next year and in 2007.<br><br>The RMAF has also expressed interest in purchasing FA18F Super Hornets in the near future. As for the remaining seven F-5E fighter jets, Zainal Abidin said they were being upgraded<br><br></strong><br>.</div>

Btw, the Taiwanese AF think it is a bad idea now that the RF-5Es constantly got "shot down" by SAMs during exercieses. They need something that fly faster and more agile. The RocAF is in fact converting some of their Vipers to carry a Recce pod.<br><br>On the other hand, RMAF can sell their 7 to RSAF or ST Aero for attrition, or why not just sell all 14 to the Phillippines, ST Aero can convert them to the S/T version before handling them to the PAF. It is a win win situation... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"> ha ha<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>RMAF have 2 RF-5E plus 14 F-5E/F.<br><br>They going to sell off 7 of them, so it make 2 RF-5E and upgrade 7 F-5s.<br><br>The qn is what kind of upgrade?<br><br>Currently most F-5 upgrade are avionics and radar, and most nations like Turkey, Brazil,Chile etc are going for Israel's Elbit/Singapore's ST option.<br>RMAF will never take up this option. Their loss.<br><br>Then there is Northrop-Grumman option(F-20?),not sure any nation have taken up this, maybe it cost more than Israel/Singapore option.<br><br>Next qn is why only 7?<br><br>7 F-5s is only 1/3 of a full sqn, unless they are not upgrading them as fighters.<br><br>I suspect they are going to be converted to RF-5 recon a/c , in view of the small number.<br><br>Singapore ST has converted some to RF-5s for RSAF as well as for Taiwanese AF, most likely RMAF will not go for this option as well.<br><br>Then they have to go for the more expensive route by having them converted by the US's Northrop-Grumman. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>My 2 cents worth.</div>
