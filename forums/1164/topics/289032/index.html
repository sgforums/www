"More complex means" - including the replacement of some structural parts - can cut the RCS of a conventional-looking aircraft by 15 - 17 dB, which substantially reduces detection range and (to an even greater extent) boosts the performance of electronic jamming, because a hostile radar needs more power to see the weaker target through the jamming signal. EADS has even developed a package of RCS-reduction measures for the A400M transport, not to make it invisible but to make its towed radar decoy more effective. <span style="color: red;">Interestingly, EADS estimates that the Super Hornet has an RCS 20 dB lower than the original F/A-18C/D, getting close to the values for aircraft like the F-22 and JSF.</span>"<br><br>Cheers,<br>Sunho</div>

The material is supposed to make any object it covers invisible to enemy radar.<br><br>But test results showed that while the stealth material worked, it added too much weight to planes. It was feared that the extra weight might affect safety and overall performance.<br><br>The hesitation sparked a strong reaction from the overseas Taiwan-ese who brought the stealth technology to Taiwan, a defense official said.<br><br>"This man is obviously very influential," the officials said. "Through special channels, he has made a complaint to President Chen Shui-bian (Â’Ã‚Â�Â…Â�G). We do not know President Chen's response to it. We fear that the man will not easily give up," the official said.<br><br>The National Security Council plays a leading role in the Black Leopard project, while the air force and the state-run Aerospace Industrial Development Corporation (AIDC) are joint executors of the plan. The spending for the project is not known and it was not included in the annual budget of the Ministry of National Defense.<br><br><span style="color: red;">The AIDC provided an AT-3 jet trainer plane for the testing of the radar-absorbing material.<br><br>The AT-3 has made 43 test flights over the past two years, sources said. The stealth material was even applied to an air-to-air missile carried by the AT-3.<br><br>In test flights against an Indigenous Defense Fighter (IDF), the AT-3 was not detectable to the IDF at a distance of 35km, which means the IDF would not have had time to respond to a missile attack by the stealth plane.<br><br>Despite the favorable test results, however, the AT-3 was thought to be carrying too much weight.</span><br><br>"The test results were only for reference since they might not be realistic enough. But a realistic test might put the test pilot in danger, because it is not known whether the extra weight on the AT-3 would pose a risk," a defense source said.<br><br>"It is also questionable whether the stealth-capable AT-3 would be able to safely fire a missile as simulated in the tests," he said.<br><br></blockquote>Cheers,<br>Sunho</div>

In cases of engine failure on take off, the nose is supposed to be maintained in a climb attitude, at least in the case of a multi engine aircraft.. The F2, well, is single engine. What I gather happened was that the pilots detected a drop in take off thrust, speed was reducing fast, so he nose-down to regain the speed in a hope that the speed increase as a result will get him lifted off the ground. The generic F-16 has its center of gravity behind its center of lift, thus it does not nose down during lose of thrust. It has to be pilot input. It was however too short a time to decide to do the correct thing, which was to eject.</div>
