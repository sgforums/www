It forces more influential powers to settle on compromises and restricts the chances that any future rogue American adminstration to wage war as they fancy it.<br><br>This, however, depends on whether China and India choose to come under the sphere of influence of America or go it alone. Should India become a strategic partner of the United States, it might create a new equation in Central Asia because the prevailing Chinese military thought can be said to be suspicious of American activity in states like Pakistan, Uzbekistan etc, which they view as an attempt to encircle Chinese influence in this region where American energy interests lie.<br><br>India wants to increase it's influence in the UN and in a multilateral setting. Her cooperation with USA on matters of nuclear despite not being a party to the Non Proliferation Treaty might prove to be a stumbling block..</div>

China and the US.<br><br>EU has constantly had infighting particularly France and Germany (They just can't seem to get along) Its a pretty fragile union.<br><br>Russia... much to be seen in the coming months. They suddenly switched sides probably enough of american bull crap but they intend to help Iran which could be a bad thing.<br><br>India, well there was much hype in the past but they just dont seem to be climbing as fast as China and I personally dont see them or talked about as a Superpower for the next 5 years.<br><br>China is the real potential super power. Their economy has been booming and they are undergoing major upgrading of their military which is an important step to being a super power.<br><br>I really hope in the future, the superpowers will be more careful of what they do. it will seriously suck if there is a major conflict.</div>

The North and the South are polar opposites of each other. It would take nothing less than an effort on the scale of the Marshall Plan to rebuild the North - both economically and psychologically.<br><br>Reuniting East and West Germany was much easier in contrast - and that wasn't really a walk in the park, either.</div>

I mean US had always claim the HR and moral high ground.. also do you know that US 'Shot by cop' incidents tally in the thousands a year.. and I'm talking about minor offences here.<br><br>And about the Tianamen incident... what would you do if you had One million anti-government rioters running around... and I sensed the west delibrately miss-reported the incident, for idealogy reason.. Communism.<br><br>The declassified US embassy cable in Beijing..   <a href="http://www.gwu.edu/~nsarchiv/NSAEBB/NSAEBB16/documents/index.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.gwu.edu/~nsarchiv/NSAEBB/NSAEBB16/documents/index.html  </a> Go thru the cable reports... it coincide with what western media are reporting... but take note of Document 31.. in which it wrote..<br><blockquote>This document, as its authors state in the outset, "<strong>attempts to set the record straight" about the events of the night of June 3-4.</strong> Contrary to earlier reports in the western media, the cable asserts that many if not most of the deaths associated with the crackdown occurred on Changan Avenue and other streets surrounding the square, rather than on Tiananmen Square itself. The document calls the notion that the military could have suffered more casualties than civilians "inconceivable," but holds that "civilian deaths probably did not reach the figure of 3,000 used in some press reports," but believes that the figure put forward by the Chinese Red Cross of 2,600 military and civilian deaths with 7,000 wounded to be "not an unreasonable estimate." The cable concludes with a detailed, hour-by-hour chronology of the events of the night of June 3-4. </blockquote>.<br><br>BBC continues to hold yearly remembrence of the incident.. giving the impression that students were massacre inside the square.. which is false.. CNN and BBC made no attempts to rectified their errors, (Washington Post did),.. but continues to propaganda it so...<br><br>And why does the Tianamen Square incident is considered Brash, when you are talking about super-power logic, which is more of international consideration.. In this aspect, US seemed brasher many times over... what they did to third world latin-american countries for resources, bananas, Sugarcanes and control of canal are all military related adventures... and Iraq too.<br></div>

I'm pretty sure absolutely nobody wants their country to fall from a superpower to a mere second rate one.<br><br></div>
