Not all of the SS soldiers are killed in Vietnam some survived to get French citizenship. Near the end of the war, they have no choice but to surrender to the yanks instead of the Soviets as the Russians will definitely kill them and not accept them as POWs. They only surrendered because they are ordered to by Berlin after Berlin is taken, at that time they were fighting in the mountains.

The non-aggression pact has been acknowledged by most as a treaty both sides needed. Germany cldnt go to war with Russia then and Russia had just purged it's entire army command.<br><br><blockquote>the germans should have never allied with the japanese.<br><br>without the japanese as their allies, the japs will not bomb pearl harbour. and US wun have gone into the war.<br><br>and without the US in the war involvement, the germans would have had control over europe.<br><br>the japanese were the allied forces in WWI. i still dun understand why must they join the Nazi thugs. </blockquote>contray to popular belief, it was Germany who declared war on the USA rather then the other way round. However this point is moot since the US was practically at war with them thru it's lend lease deal<br><br><blockquote>erm<br><br>if germany didn't attack russia, we would be speaking german right now. maybe..but why? because germany suffered heavy casualties invading russia. not because russia's military capabilities, but because the weather was so cold that the german army literally froze to death. how do you invade an ice cold russia at that time?</blockquote>Well while the cold did play a part it really was the 100 fresh crack siberian divisions that really turned the tide of the war. Armed with the best weapons and with winter clothing as well as being well lead and being super fresh, these guys were given the task of stopping the German army.<br><br><blockquote>precisely.<br><br>russia is very cold and that's the advantage the russians used against their enemies.<br><br>even the swedes who once tried to invade russia were repelled.<br><br>the livonian &amp; teutonic knights lost the crusade against the russians as well.<br><br>the french under napoleon also lost the war against the russians.<br></blockquote>The teutonic knights lost to lituania(spelling?) and poland not russia.<br>They were stopped somewhere near kalingrad(East prussia back then)<br><br>The Mongols overan most of the russian duchies. The likes of kiev and moscovy.<br><br>The swedes if i'm not mistaken actually won the war and took finland?That i'm not too sure.<br><br><blockquote>partly it's because of communism.<br><br>another thing is that the leaders are too agressive on the russian side. they are bent on competing with the US for world domination and power, without knowing that during stalin's regime, he killed more than a million of the russians to secure his position. and because of the war, which the soviets suffered the highest casualties.<br><br>therefore, having suffered the hardship and losses of the war, the russian had to rebuild, but instead they started the cold war which is a bad move.<br><br>thus, they lost to the US and suffered poverty once again.<br></blockquote>Actually it wasnt that. It was that the Russians tried too hard to out do the US. As such, they invested less in trying to improve the life of the people and more on the military. This took place in the early 80's and cause the crash in the 90's.<br><br><blockquote>I did remember coming across a book that suggested that the US intended to invade Russia and push Russian forces back after the Russians capture Berlin.
