            <div class='col-md body'>It is really not so easy to win !!<br><br><strong><a href="http://www.newscientisttech.com/article.ns?id=dn11021&amp;feedId=online-news_rss20" rel="nofollow">Street-fighting robot challenge announced,  24 January 2007, NewScientist.com news service<br>* New Scientist Tech and AFP</a></strong><br><blockquote>A contest to build a robot that can operate autonomously in urban warfare conditions, moving in and out of buildings to search and destroy targets like a human soldier, was launched in Singapore on Tuesday.<br><br>The country's Defence Science and Technology Agency (DSTA) is offering one million Singapore dollars ($652,000) to whoever develops a robot that completes a stipulated set of tasks Â– yet to be revealed Â– in the fastest time possible.<br><br>DSTA said individuals, companies, universities and research institutes are all welcome to participate in the contest, dubbed the TechX Challenge, although foreigners must collaborate with local partners.<br><br>"Operation in urban areas represents a significant challenge," DSTA chief executive Richard Lim said at the launch of the contest. "Recent military experiences in Iraq, the Middle East and other locations have clearly illustrated these challenges."<br>Remote control<br><br>Currently, robots deployed for urban warfare missions are normally operated remotely by a human, tying up resources, Lim said. DSTA wants to create a robot that "must, on its own, be able to navigate both indoors and outdoors in an urban landscape and accomplish a set of assigned tasks within a stipulated time", he said.<br><br>This robot must be able to negotiate a staircase and use the elevator to dash from one floor to another without the aid of satellite navigation, which may not be available indoors.<br><br>Navigation without satellite help would require the robot "to have machine vision capabilities to identify visual cues along its intended path to serve as waypoints", Lim said.<br><br>Robert Richardson at the University of Manchester, UK, says the competition could present a major challenge to even the most sophisticated robot. He notes that robots can navigate through an "unrestricted urban environment", by building a virtual map of a 3D space with relative ease.<br>Different doors<br><br>But Richardson adds that slightly more complex tasks, like opening a door or using an elevator, can present a huge problem. "How do you know which button goes where, or even what floor you're on?" he says. "It's very, very confusing." One solution, he says, is to train a robot by presenting it with hundreds of different doors and elevators.<br><br>Some defence experts say the fight against terrorism has made urban warfare increasingly common, and believe that high-tech weaponry could help minimise casualties.<br><br>Participants must submit their applications by the end of May 2007 and a shortlist of participants will be announced in June 2007. The robots will be tested in a qualifying round in May 2008 and a final round, in August 2008, will crown the robot warrior that can complete the assigned task in the fastest time.</blockquote><img src="http://www.newscientisttech.com/data/images/ns/covers/20070414.jpg"></div>

They have been using television guided warheads for a long time. It is a question of attempting to adapt the technology to this. Image Recognition technology like OCR has been around for a long time and has been quite successful at recognising patterns. Unless they choose rather to use some high resolution IR or radar or a combination of a lot of sensors. I believe the Israelis are working very hard and produced some examples of robots of this variety.<br><br>And driving a car through the desert is probably harder especially when the vehicle has to detect the terrain and attempt to follow a path that will not lead to the vehicle toppling over. You have lots of sensors as well and real time processing is required. During the first competition, a lot of cars had a problem of either crashing or toppling over. I'm of the opinion that the latter is harder as the former doesn't have to worry too much about terrain especially when it is generally flat. Not least, sensor malfunctions due to the heat wasn't uncommon. Do note that for example, one of the winning cars which was by Stanford has as many as 7 Pentium M CPUs. What DSTA is demanding is far less ambitious than DARPA.<br><br>Also, as I have said before, 600K USD probably will come with a contract for a few robots so it won't be merely that paltry amount.</div>
