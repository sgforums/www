              <p>&gt;SINGAPORE has shown interest in possibly buying up to 100 of the
              stealthy, multi-role F-35 Joint Strike Fighter (JSF) aircraft over
              coming decades, said the general in charge of the programme for the
              Pentagon.<br> <br> Said Air Force Major-General Charles Davis, the Pentagon's programme
              chief: "The Israelis have said they'd take up to 100 aircraft. The
              Singaporeans have said basically the same thing."<br> <br> Embassy spokesmen for the two countries had no immediate comment.<br> <br> The world's most advanced fighter jet, the supersonic F-35 is designed
              to attack moving targets in any environment. It uses stealth technology
              to prevent detection by radar or infrared sensors.<br> <br> Development of the super- fighter was co-financed by Britain, Italy,
              the Netherlands, Turkey, Canada, Australia, Denmark and Norway.<br> <br> Singapore, as a security cooperation participant of the multinational
              programme, has access to proprietary information, including flight
              simulations.<br> <br> Israel is currently the only nation involved at this level, one rung down from the nine JSF programme partners.<br> <br> Singapore's Ministry of Defence, in a previous comment on the F-35 JSF,
              said the plane was "a potential candidate" to meet the air force's
              "longer-term requirements for a multi-role fighter".<br> <br> The United States currently plans to buy a total of 2,443 F-35 models.
              Hundreds of others may be sold overseas to replace a range of fighters,
              including Lockheed Martin F-16s and Boeing F-18s.<br> <br> It is the costliest US arms programme ever at a projected US$299 billion (S$407 billion).<br> <br> The conventional version is projected to cost about US$68 million apiece. -- AGENCIES</p>

              <p>When F5E entered services in 1979,it was alreday 20 years old!!</p>
              <p>So,is it in the same class of F16 A/B,after upgrading?</p>
              <blockquote>
              <p><span>They entered service in 1979 and since
              then have been serving their roles as air defence interceptors. It was
              in Dec 1989 that an upgrade of the F-5E, renamed F-5S was approved.Â  <br></span></p>
              </blockquote><blockquote>
              <p><span>The upgrade was necessary as the
              avionics in the aircraft was about 30 years old and was considered
              essential in order to meet the RSAF's future operational needs. The
              contract was awarded to Singapore Technologies Aerospace (STAe) in Jul
              91. <br></span></p>
              </blockquote><blockquote><span>Work began in 1992 and the first
              prototype flight testing started in 1994. The upgrade included
              improvements in radar capabilities; weapons delivery and navigation
              systems; and cockpit layout. The upgrade has put the F-5S in the same
              class as modern day fighter aircraft and has extended the useful life
              of the F-5 by another 10 to 15 years. The F-5 squadrons are now
              striving towards achieving Final Operational Capability in about a
              year's time. </span></blockquote>

              <p>Hi,</p>
              <p>Â </p>
              <p>I think it is possible that the F16A/B that we gifted to RTAF is more capable then the upgraded F5S.</p>
              <p>Â </p>
              <p>The F5 upgrade is on the radar and avionics.... there is no engine or airframe upgrade. It is likely to be quite old in terms of airframe hours and is still powered by an underpowered J85 engine....</p>
              <p>Â </p>
              <p>However, we have &gt;40 of them....and replacing them at one go would be difficult.</p>
              <p>Â </p>
              <p>we only have 7 F16A/B and have a much larger number of F16C/D. It makes sense to get rid of the A/B to standardize our F16 fleet... the RTAF have F16A/B which means they can be standize too...</p>

              <p>actually 20 years ago, we bought the 4x F16A and 4x F16B...at that time, it was a 'breakthrough' to be operating such advanced jet....</p>
              <p>Â </p>
              <p>who would expect in 2008 that the RSAF annouce that we are operating F15!!! which is supposed sooo expensive with 2x F100 engine each consuming twice the amount of aviation fuel as the F16!</p>
              <p>Â </p>
              <p>I think by the time the squadron pilots flying the F35 are probably still in primary school, we will surely be one of the last buyers of F35!</p>

              <p>we should be seening F-15 + F-35 operating together.</p>
              <p>Â </p>
              <p>100 f-35 is just a figure - we would not be seeing all of them together. More of like our f-16A, F-16C/D &amp; F-16 block 52+ ....</p>
              <p><br>We would see some eariler model or delivered F-35 phased out with some new model f-35Â  .... thus we would have about 60-80 operation only at one timeÂ which replace f-16 &amp; F5E .</p>

              <p>So,i dunt think F5(after almost total tranformation ,so called upgrading)</p>

              <p>Lionnoisy, plane have lifespan, it depend on usage and hour in the air. Even though we upgrade some of them, but that will only extent the life for that long.Â If we keep it flying with older engines , will only burn more money in fuel.</p>
              <p>Â </p>
              <p>F-35 is being consider now, and not later.</p>
              <p>Â </p>
              <p>You say technology change so fast , no point in commiting so early .... ? Which day technology does not change, you can keep waiting for tomorrow as tomorrow alway something new.Â As there is queue for production &amp; delivery, thus sometime we have to just go for it. Frankly Rafale, Eurofighter, Su-35, gripen are all around and we already know their capabilities and their planned capabilities. By now with the f-35 in the late stage with even test flight done, we too would have access to its capabilities .... thus it is a good time for us to decide.</p>
              <p>Â </p>
              <p>We have invested in F-15 , but it is time also to source for suitable replacement for our F-16 &amp; f-5E, which F-15 is not suitable as replacement.</p>

              <p>This is impossible. RSAF buys planes according to its needs. The F-35 by itself cannot satisfy all the needs of the RSAF (interceptor, strike, fighter etc). There is no such plane that can do everything. If you want to know more or less what RSAF will have in its fleet, just keep watch on the Israeli Air Force. Our fleet is never that much differentÂ from them.Â </p>
