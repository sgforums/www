              <p>Quite nice pic. I cant imagine what Msia would have to say IF we get this. Couple this with the pedra branca and the water issue and wateva not, they might go bonkers. lol</p>
              <p>Ya I think that this is a more feasible option. RSN alr has the Endurance class of amphibious transport docks, which helis can land on, so this would be more realistic, though I doubt that we would really get this. I checked on wikipedia that this is only 8500 tonnes loaded weight, while the Japanese ship weighs in at 18000 tonnes loaded. I cant imagine how many times bigger in dimensions this is.</p>
              <p>And in any case, I see no reason for us to have such a ship. For maritime patrol purposes, the current RSS Endurance is good enough. We dont really need F-35s flying over and watching the pirates do we?? Having Fokker-50s on the ship would be better, but I havent heard of any F-50s doing carrier-based missions yet. I dont even know whether it can be launched and landed on the carrier.</p>

              <p>These are other variables that we cannot predict in the future.  Its easy to rule out things if we use current circumstances as the premise for future options.  Who knows? Maybe the carrier doesn't even have to be too big if they are shooting off UCAVs?</p>

              <p><br>Still it is extremely unlikely.</p>
              <p>I don't think our outlook in our defend needs will change in 10 years by this much.</p>
              <p>To have such a ship will show a extremely marked departure from our current tactics.</p>
              <p>Moreover, our frigate requires a minimum crew of less than 80 and there's problems even with that. And you know very well it is a fairly automated ship that relies on systems to slim-down the manpower requirement.</p>
              <p>No. 10 years will not suffice. Or even if you rope in females to do NS. Why? Think about it. Why does the RSN has the highest proportion of regulars amongst all the services relying on a small number of regulars?</p>
              <p>The training! Do you know how much there is to learn? It won't make any sense to use NSFs to fill ALL or even majority of the gaps.</p>

              <p>Yeap, that I have to agree with you.  The outlook in terms of manpower definitely rules out the possibility of having a floating bird farm any time soon.</p>

              <p><br>Haha.....honestly, I don't see the point of having an aircraft carrier.</p>
              <p>And looking at the current framework, how the RSAF and RSN cooperates in the helo-ops for the frigates and LSTs. I can safely say having a carrier will change everything.</p>
              <p>Speaking to ASWO (ASW officer for helo) one day, I found out why he kept appearing, on and off, and didn't seem to have any fixed place and was tired of moving around. He aptly summed it all up when he told me this: I'm a RSN officer but my name is in the RSAF pay-roll.<img title="Laughing" src="http://lahcc.sgforums.com/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing"></p>
              <p>This is glaring evidence of the effects of having a lean manpower SAF oftens boasts about. For all the advantages of such a slim force to work the RSN or SAF for the matter, there are many disadvantages that follow. The one I high-lighted is a small one.</p>

              <p>Seriously SG dosen't need an aircraft carrier or heli carrier or even amphibious carrier. Such carriers are usually meant to be offensive rather than defensive. Look at the history of aircraft carriers and you will find that their primary objective for patrolling is to be able to send their planes to attack a place more rapidly rather than defending their own waters.</p>
              <p>Also, the major problem arrising from having an aircraft carrier is the disruption of peace within SEA. Why in heaven must a small country like us process such an offensive weapon? I thought the primary doctrine for our defence force is to deter the enemy long enough to recieve help from our allies? I would rather have more defenses on the island than to have a carrier floating somewhere in the straits.</p>

              <p>no way singapore will own a carrier. the manpower and resources needed to sustain a carrier group is way too much. you need to double or triple RSN's manpower to even come close to the manpower requirement for a carrier group.</p>
              <p>and besides, looking at the rate which RSAF is churning out pilots, they won't buy 100 F-35s. more like 20+ and spare parts. besides, it's "Up to 100 F-35s", so the interpretation is up to you.</p>
              <p>oh btw, an aircraft carrier will destabilise the entire region. some countries were not exactly happy when kitty hawk was docking at CNB for transit, much less if the kitty hawk is actually ours. think arms race?</p>

              is the disruption of peace within SEA.<strong> Why in heaven must a small
              country like us process such an offensive weapon?</strong> I thought the
              primary doctrine for our defence force is to deter the enemy long
              enough to recieve help from our allies? I would rather have more
              defenses on the island than to have a carrier floating somewhere in
              the straits.</p>

              <p>Considering that there are medium powers (eg India) with carriers in our region that may reach us, the strength of their fleet doesnt require us to pre empt them by sending a carrier fleet to perform blockage. We can deal with them assymetrically.</p>

              <p>Yes the F-35 has a variant that can do VTOL, but it makes no sense to have little ships carrying a few F-35s VTOLing for every mission. Conventional arrestor landings is still much more economical cos landing vertically consumes loads of time and fuel. Its not a smart idea to do so.</p>

              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">What leads you to presuppose 'nukes can't even "knockout" a
              country'? Nuclear weapons are very much a threat to the stability
              and even survival of any country, hence the furore over Iran and
              North Korea concerning their alleged possession of nuclear weapons.
              Think over it yourself - wouldn't you consider Singapore to be
              especially vulnerable to such a weapon?</span></p>
              <p>Do you know the term "Second Strike"? While if you don't, it means the capability to retaliate without any form of assistance from the mainland. Variations of this include having well-protected, well-hidden silos, nuke subs and carrier groups out at sea and stationing military assets and professionals out of the country. These ensures that even if the country is nuked, it will be possible to retaliate back.</p>
              <p>The international communtities are concerned over nuclear programme in Iran and N.K because they are worried that any aggression may results in a large number of deaths, not because they are afraid that they can't retaliate (or in your terms, being knocked-out)</p>
              <p>Singapore is vulnerable. Every country is. However, you've missed out the point that most country have reliable defense system to counter such a threat. Also, a country which uses nukes will face alot of economical and political pressure by the international community and neighbours of the target country. So i don't think SG will be the only one worrying if it were to be nuked, malaysia and indoneasia will be sure to join in.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">You don't think "any country would be without a proper defence
              system to detect any attacks"? You couldn't be any further from the
              truth. You may simply be ignorant, but a lot of countries do not
              have comprehensive early warning systems.</span></p>
              <p>Am i ignorant? Or are you arrogant? Even having a group of people watching out on top of trees can also be considered a form of early warning system.  Any country which have a military force would definitely have early warning capability. Without it, their army are sitting ducks.</p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Also, you think that the only method of defense conceivable is
              to merely ward off everything that is being thrown at us. However,
              Shotgun is talking about pre-emptively striking at the enemy's
              heartland, to hinder the progress of their invasion. If this enemy
              is distant but possesses carriers to attack us, and we have no such
              assets to strike at their country, it is our loss, after all.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #000000;">Striking at the enemy's heartland to hinder the progress of their invasion? I think that would only further agitate </span>them, causing a more rapid invasion. Knowing our nation's emphasis on diplomacy and deterrence, i think the internation communty and our friends would have responded to the threat by pressuring them economically or by the means of force if our "enemy" was to send a carrier out for us. Just like what the coalitions did for kuwait and saudi arabia in response towards iraq's greed. Also, in the terms of defense, i think planes taking off from the mainland would be at a advantage when facing the planes which flew from the carrier.</p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">And I'm amused when you simply generalise a carrier group as not
              practical. If we're going to perform a pre-emptive strike, "more
              planes, ships and new technology" will not be more practical when
              they have neither the range nor passage to perform such an
              operation. A carrier group, on the other hand, allows us to extend
              the reach of our military power as long as there is deep water for
              the carrier to travel over.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #000000;">You are amused at my words? While i nearly laughed my ass out when i read your reply. Pre-emptive strike? That would make us the aggressor and we will be the ones at fault. Our military force is more for defense rather than for aggression and having a carrier group may not equates to extending our reach, others have defenses too you know.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">What are you talking about with "wars are never over"? I don't
              think we regard the Vietnam War as current, do we? And why are you
              talking about resistance fighters when the topic is on Singapore's
              defense? Nobody ever said that Singapore was going to invade a
              country. Irrelevant.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #000000;">There are usually two outcomes of war. Either the defender wins or the aggressor wins. When the defender wins, the nation would most probably be hostile to the aggressor nation and would most like impose certain santions or boycott products made from that country. When the aggressor wins, there will always be resistance movement to counter the invading forces. When i said wars are never over, i include economical and social, physical and physcological warfare as well as the board spectrum of warfares which would be too many to be listed out. </span></p>
              <p>Lastly, resistance fighters are considered a part of a nation's defence. Irrelevant? Guess you're too innocent instead.</p>
