              <p>It was mentioned before by an ex RSAF chief that in the future, most likely RSAF will just operate 2 types of aircraft.  If so I'm guessing its F-35 for multirole and F-15SG for strike.</p>
              <p>Personally I think 3 is a better option then you can have the F-16C/D for interceptor role.  C/D may not be the newest model but it still has a lot of bite.</p>

              <p>Unlikely.  The F-35 is supposed to be those multi-role, plug and play kinda fighter already.  Its already a fighter capable of all the roles you mentioned above.</p>
              <p>The F-16s will not be able to operate more than another 15 years or so.  The newer jets offer so much performance increase, but their wear n tear is also higher.  I've heard of how snr technicians curse and swear when ACMI shows their pilots hitting 9.5gs on the F-16.</p>

              <p>Urgh. Military nutcases.</p>
              <p>There is no F-35S, F or R. The designations are A, B and C. F-35 is a multirole aircraft anyway, so the designations you gave have no meaning since it is capable of all that. The F-35Bs and Cs are designed as naval-based aircraft, so it is almost certain that Singapore will only be buying F-35As if at all, because we do not have aircraft carriers, or the organisational framework to operate naval-based air assets, or even the plans to do so.</p>
              <p>Please remember, that when militaries (or any organisation, for that matter) quote an upper limit on the purchase of equipment, it is just an <em>upper limit</em>. They have no obligation to buy exactly that number of units, so don't be expecting 100+ F-35As around in Singapore. Besides, there will invariably be detachments based overseas for training and reserve.</p>
              <p>Only a single squadron? Highly unlikely. The fact that they are open to obtaining up to 100 units notwithstanding, it is always far easier to standardise the airforce and use as few aircraft types effectively in order to exploit the economies of scale in training and maintenance. It will be far cheaper and simpler for the military to replace parts and carry out standard maintenance procedures, and they won't have to fumble around with too many different pilot programs for all the different aircraft. In any case, we cannot expect SAF to be shrinking anytime soon - if anything, they look set to expand in the future.</p>

              <p>It is official.We will continue use the F5S for quite some time.</p>

              <p>What is the cost to acquire and maintain/overhaul in the life cycles?</p>
              <p>The rule of thumb is 2 to 3 times of initial  purchase cost to maintain</p>
              <p>in the life cycle.So,$$ is a big problems.U have to spend</p>
              <p>it wisely.Is there any better options?</p>
              <p>First ,SG has yet to receive F15.U can see from history that SG</p>
              <p>will use any major platform for 25 to 30 years before it is retired.</p>
              <p>2nd,100 seems too many for SG.</p>

              <p>My only qualm about the F-35 is that there's no two seater version, which presents some problems. Not least that the fighter has a smaller bomb bay than the F-22 and carrying munitions on the wing span simply defeats the point of a stealth plane.</p>

              <p>What? The F-22 is two engined. What are you talking about? As it is, barring the F-35, a good majority of USN planes are 2 engined since the start of the jet age for fighter aircraft. In fact, the F-22 is a much better plane, and less than double the price of the F-35. The US Air Force is better off buying the F-22 than the F-35.</p>
              <p>In any case, the USN ordered only a few hundred aircraft, about 300 over I hear and split between the USN and the USMC. That's barely enough to replace all the F/A-18E/Fs. It's likely given the relatively new nature of the F/A-18E/F that the USN will do any significant replacement of the aircraft.</p>

              <p>Have u any idea wha you're saying?? Singapore buying an aircraft carrier?? Dude, its not only about the cost. Singapore for sure has enough cash to buy an a/c carrier, but ask yourself why it doesnt have one as of yet. Simple, WE DO NOT NEED ONE!</p>
              <p>An a/c carrier is kind of a power projection symbol, or whatever you call it. The US has quite a few cos it needs to extend its power reach over the entire world. Singapore does not need it cos there simply is no use for it. And trust me, if we EVER do buy one, Msia isnt just going to sit back and watch us sail it over their waters. This might spark off an arms race, and I assure you relations btw the 2 will be strained to breaking pt.</p>
              <p>I feel that your way of thinking is quite naive, in that all it takes for a country to have an a/c carrier is just for it to have cash. Its not like this. 1st and foremost, the country would need to have the manpower. If I'm not wrong, an a/c carrier needs to have 5000 men to run it, and our navy only has about 5000 regulars or somwhere around there. If we pool almost all our resources into one ship, wat abt the rest of the navy? Just sit there collect dust??? Also, the logistics needed to run this huge ship, and also to open up an entirely new naval fighter wing will be tremendous. Would we do it just for the sake of having a carrier? I dont think so.</p>
              <p>The RSN alr has a few ships which are able to carry helis like the Super Puma and soon to come, the S-70 Seahawk. I think that this is alr good enough for a country like us for now.</p>
