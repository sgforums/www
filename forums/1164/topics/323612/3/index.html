              <p>Have u any idea wha you're saying?? Singapore buying an aircraft
              carrier?? Dude, its not only about the cost. Singapore for sure has
              enough cash to buy an a/c carrier, but ask yourself why it doesnt
              have one as of yet. Simple, WE DO NOT NEED ONE!</p>
              <p>An a/c carrier is kind of a power projection symbol, or whatever
              you call it. The US has quite a few cos it needs to extend its
              power reach over the entire world. Singapore does not need it cos
              there simply is no use for it. And trust me, if we EVER do buy one,
              Msia isnt just going to sit back and watch us sail it over their
              waters. This might spark off an arms race, and I assure you
              relations btw the 2 will be strained to breaking pt.</p>
              <p>I feel that your way of thinking is quite naive, in that all it
              takes for a country to have an a/c carrier is just for it to have
              cash. Its not like this. 1st and foremost, the country would need
              to have the manpower. If I'm not wrong, an a/c carrier needs to
              have 5000 men to run it, and our navy only has about 5000 regulars
              or somwhere around there. If we pool almost all our resources into
              one ship, wat abt the rest of the navy? Just sit there collect
              dust??? Also, the logistics needed to run this huge ship, and also
              to open up an entirely new naval fighter wing will be tremendous.
              Would we do it just for the sake of having a carrier? I dont think
              so.</p>
              <p>The RSN alr has a few ships which are able to carry helis like
              the Super Puma and soon to come, the S-70 Seahawk. I think that
              this is alr good enough for a country like us for now.</p>
              </div>
              </blockquote>
              <p>That's why I said I guess. Some think insufficient cash is 1 reason of not owning a carrier, so I mentioned cash is not a problem.<br>If singapore is to own one carrier, needless to say, of coz cannot stick to the current number of regulars. You are like saying that singapore cannot increase the population to 6 million because it only import <em>n</em> tonnes of food per day which is just enough for 4 million.</p>

              <p>enough of singapore and aircraft carrier discussion.. those two terms should not even be used in the same sentence...</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Below is the list of countries operating a/c carriers... notice how few there are? and how many countries with larger GDPs and defence priorities, Iseral, South Korea, Taiwan etc etc... are not on the list!</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>even australia is not operating a/c carriers....</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>we recently tranistioned from a brown water navy to a force that operate 6x FFGs! and that is a huge milestone already....</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>and you don't need an a/c carrier to fight pirates, a few PVs with a 76mm gun is more then sufficient......</p>

But what if another mahathir step up? What if their navy close one eye or even disguise into pirate to avoid international condemn at the same time harass our transportation of daily necessities including food and oil in the aim of forcing us to compromise in various terms and conditions.<br>I like the idea from spartan_6 to build or buy a sub carrier, which is now already owned by countries like south korea and japan.<br>This sub carrier during war time can quickly be upgraded to become a full fledge carrier.<br>Due to sensitivity, it may carry helicopter first.

              <p>Actually, realistically.... if any country tries to harass
              shipping in the straits of malacca... they can expect strong
              response from powers such as the US, Japan etc... and maybe even
              the PRC!<br>These countries have as much at stake as Singapore in keeping
              our SLOCs open.</p>
              <p>even if there are these non-conventional threats.... it will
              probbaly be mining or speed-boats... kind of like the Iranian
              Revolutionary Guards....</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I wonder how a a/c carrier could deal with mines and speed
              boats...</p>

              <p>Last time I was also like you, thinking that carrier shouldn't be used to fight pirates.<br>That is true for country like malaysia and indonesia bcoz malacca strait is just in front of them. They can send their speedboat with half fuel tank to petrol, if needed, they can call for an helicopter to help anytime, since their helicopter port is so near.</p>
              <p>But for Singapore, that is not possible coz the distance is too far. So we have to use carrier that can station there for a long time.<br>If navy of other countries disguise as pirate, US, China all these can't whack them coz no evidence that they are from a government. Worst coz their weapon even more powerful. They may carry not just machine gun but hand-carry anti-air missile like those used by hezbollah. Of coz the carrier will carry not just F-35 but also helicopter coz it is good in rescuing task.<br><br>Other than fighting pirates and ensure safe import of oil and food, the aircraft carrier also provide a training platform for the pilots. Who knows in the future once our technology mature, can even sell carriers worldwide. Water is rising very fast now, the demand of a floating platform will increase.</p>
              <p>Regarding your last question on how a/c deal with mining and speedboat, ok, they can also use destroyer and helicopter to do that.</p>

              <p>Quite nice pic. I cant imagine what Msia would have to say IF we get this. Couple this with the pedra branca and the water issue and wateva not, they might go bonkers. lol</p>
              <p>Ya I think that this is a more feasible option. RSN alr has the Endurance class of amphibious transport docks, which helis can land on, so this would be more realistic, though I doubt that we would really get this. I checked on wikipedia that this is only 8500 tonnes loaded weight, while the Japanese ship weighs in at 18000 tonnes loaded. I cant imagine how many times bigger in dimensions this is.</p>
              <p>And in any case, I see no reason for us to have such a ship. For maritime patrol purposes, the current RSS Endurance is good enough. We dont really need F-35s flying over and watching the pirates do we?? Having Fokker-50s on the ship would be better, but I havent heard of any F-50s doing carrier-based missions yet. I dont even know whether it can be launched and landed on the carrier.</p>

              <p>aircraft carriers seem to be uneccesary. our situation doesnt
              warrant one really. i guess the most we can go would be to base
              f-35 type aircrafts on the endurances as breif attachements, (to
              demonstrate that we have the capability ?)</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>but however not for long-term power projection
              purposes.</p>
              <p>it sort of reminds me of the australian amphib ship
              thingy...superbugs on a crate.....</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>2 engines (A) are better than 1(B) of course lar.</p>
              <p>if in A, you lose an engne, you still can fly back to fight
              another day....</p>
              <p>in B, you lose an engine... bye bye... quite a waste of pilots
              eh?</p>

              <p>We won't lose a pilot just cos a single engine plane flames out.  Pilots flying the F-16s readily train flying flame out approaches on simulation.  If necessary, they can glide the aircraft nearer to base before ejecting too. </p>
              <p>Any other failures that would result in a catastrophic failure in a single engine aircraft will also cause a catastrophic failure in a twin engine aircraft.</p>
              <p>A Singapore aircraft carrier is an unlikely event in the next 10 years.  But don't rule it out. Years ago, just as Singapore was acquiring the F-16As, everyone figured that the F-15s were an impossibility, that they were too "offensive". </p>
              <p>There are 101 ways to say its unlikely, but when we really need it, we'll get it.</p>

              <p>You guys know the RSN has a serious manpower shortage.</p>
              <p>But do you guys know how severe it is?</p>
              <p>And please tell me why there's a requirement for such a strike craft. Don't tell me that a small-aircraft carrier/helo-carrier or whatever is needed to strike to defend or any bull-shit like these.</p>
              <p>If I have limited manpower I would still try for something beyond my punch?</p>
