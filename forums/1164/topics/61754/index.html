"All of Italy is behind them and supports them in this bitter trial."<br><br>The Pope condemned the bombing, describing it as a "vile attack" against a misssion of peace.<br><br>Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi said the attack would not derail Italy's commitment to helping Iraq, but the Italian opposition has demanded the withdrawal of the country's troops from Iraq.<br><br>"They were sent to an Iraq in flames because the government wanted to do a favour for the Bush administration without taking risks into consideration," said Pietro Folena of the main opposition party, the Democrats of the Left.<br><br>"Now the Italian soldiers must come home. It is the only right thing to do at this moment."<br><br>Members of other opposition parties made similar demands.<br><br><strong>US soldier killed </strong><br><br>Vehicle bombs have been used in attacks on numerous organisations in Iraq since the war ended, including the United Nations and the International Red Cross.<br><br>Nasiriya, a Shia Muslim city that saw heavy fighting during the war, had been relatively quite in recent months.<br><br>However, the BBC's Peter Biles says the bombing of a minibus in Basra on Tuesday and the killing of a Polish soldier near Karbala last week point to a possible upsurge of attacks in southern Iraq.<br><br>Elsewhere in Iraq, the US military says another of its soldiers has been killed in an explosion north of Baghdad.<br><br>He died when a bomb exploded under his vehicle during a patrol on Tuesday night.<br><br>More than 150 US troops have been killed in attacks by unknown groups since major combat operations in Iraq ended.<br><br></div>
