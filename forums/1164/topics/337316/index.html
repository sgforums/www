              <p>Went to Changi Village last few weeks with my buddy to get a CR Speed holster for IPSC at src while i wanted to get a set of bdu since a set of tru-spec multi-cam.</p>
              <p>Went into the shops which hang lots of gun replicas with orange tips which og sells for around $20. Exactly off the shelf pieces since i collect them. Priced at $80 and above. Absolutly a rip off!</p>
              <p>Went to look at the bdus which they had acu, marpat, tri-coloured dessert and multi-cam. When i asked Louis(that guy at sembawang cc having an airsoft range) if they were tru-spec, he replied that they are tru-spec. Looked the quality through before i got them. And noticed that the acu dont feel like they were from tru-spec since i own a set. Searched for the tag and noticed that there were no tru-spec logo but instead, some military looking patches in the shirt saying sometihing like;</p>
              <p>Mil-Spec Military Battle Dress Uniform....</p>
              <p>And when i questioned Louis, he said that they are out of stock and these are made in thailand. At $160 a set!</p>
              <p>Damn! Was so pissed when i realised that he was trying to con me. Even tru-specs at $160, i would fark him since i can get it at Sheares at $140!</p>
              <p>Louis later introduced some CR looking holster, retailing at $380. Telling us that it is a design that CR copied from.</p>
              <p>Since its almost at the same price and there isnt a steady stock for CRs in the country, he decided to get it.</p>
              <p>I'm using a half 1911 double stack JR Speed Holster made in Phillipines while the holster(the fake CR) was made in thailand after carefully inspecting the holster after shit happens.</p>
              <p>Got my JR from Potong pasir CC which is a steel gun holster at around $350 since CR holsters for leftie is damn diffucult to find.</p>
              <p>A pinoy holster is much better than a SA designed holster? Obviously the thai holster is a pirated version of the SA designed holster.</p>
              <p>Even the safety lock on the holster(which prevents people grabbing the arm and prevents dropping of the arm) is on, one can simpily pull the gun off the holster with the lock still on.</p>
              <p>Went chuk tu chuk lately and found it less than 1000bhat for that identical piece.</p>
              <p>Damn! Will never return to that shop. Not flaming the shop but mentioning the facts</p>

              <p>Then can you answer me these questions:</p>
              <p>1.  How are you related to that shop?  Are you the owner, co-owner?  Or what?</p>
              <p>2.  If the above is NO, did the owner <span style="font-weight: bold;">tell</span> you what was the reason he charged pinky a higher price?  </p>
              <p>Realise that in your post earlier which was edited, that you explicitly said the owner overcharged him due to his size, and due to the need for extra materials. </p>
              <p>Also, how is all of this experience in that shop, linked in anyway to the "Airshow in China" thread.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I edited your posts because it was obvious to me that by the way you attacked his physical size in both threads (one of which was not relevant to this problem), that you were out intentionally flame him.  And you even created a BRAND new account just to do so.  Hence it was deemed to be a personal agenda that you had, irregardless you were telling the truth or not.  </p>

              <p>More than 40 page views for this post so far. Its sure to go and check the truth out yourself at their shop in changi village and see if this lard dummy or ptepinky is a liar. Simple!</p>
