            <div class='col-md body'>source: Â© 2004 WorldNetDaily.com<br><br>Israel's plans to build what is described as a high-tech, "super amphibious attack ship" as the cornerstone of a new naval strategy for the 21st century is certain to raise objections in the Arab world, says a report in the latest issue of Joseph Farah's G2 Bulletin, the premium online intelligence newsletter published by WND.<br><br>According to the plan presented by Gen. Ydidya Yaari, the navy will undertake a new role by introducing a multi-purpose attack ship capable of deploying anywhere in the Mediterranean and with a range of up to 3,200 kilometers.<br><br>This newly visualized unit is described as a 13,000-ton ship that will become the largest Israeli navy surface vessel capable of carrying armor, commando troops, helicopters and unmanned drones.<br><br>In addition, the navy envisions even more capabilities, such as launching decks for short takeoffs and landings and aircraft including the future U.S. main attack F-35 fighter jet.<br><br>The vessel is being developed parallel to planning of the Saar-5-II multi-purpose high-tech battleship, which is already in the blueprint stage with a planned investment of $1 billion. U.S. companies such as Lockheed-Martin and Northrop-Grumman are involved with the plan and are apparently ready to shift to the more ambitious project initiated by Yaari.<br><br>Sources in the Israeli navy say Yaari is willing to shelve the Saar-5-II project and to divert a similar budget, and even more, toward the futuristic attack vessel. Israeli Chief of Staff General Moshe "Buggi" Yaalon is now studying all the pros and cons of the proposed project.<br><br>A preliminary decision is expected on the future of the project no later than this month, G2 Bulletin reports.<br><br>Other sources say it will take much longer if the decision favors the plan since the IDF will have to introduce the project to the Ministry of Defense, which will then have to raise the issue with the prime minister and the Cabinet.<br><br>A well-informed source in Israel's prime minister's office told G2 Bulletin, "such an ambitious plan will have to be discussed with the U.S., which may be under pressure by Arab countries, especially Egypt, to do everything possible to sink the concept before it is tendered."<br><br>A source linked to the American defense industry says this diplomatic battle is already in progress since U.S. manufacturers, under threats of huge contract cancellations by such countries as Greece and Turkey, may produce more allies for the plan.<br><br>It is believed the new concept will be developed and, to a large extent manufactured, in the U.S., providing much-needed jobs. It is also believed the futuristic idea is so unique it might catch the attention of the Pentagon, especially the U.S. Navy. Undoubtedly other countries such as Australia, South Korea and Taiwan are closely following all aspects of the revolutionary new idea.<br><br>With a crew of 115, the new unit would become the largest in the Israeli navy and would serve as leverage to change Israel's current defense strategies by viewing and preparing for new threats stemming from the war against terrorism. It would also distinctly contribute to the defense against missile attacks, since the idea is to incorporate in such a naval unit not only an attack force, but also high-tech defense systems designed to intercept missiles, enemy submarines and to warn of any possible danger to Israel and her allies.<br><br>Opponents of the project claim this super-naval unit will demand the building of additional long-range missile boats of the Saar-5 group, a large 1,200-ton missile boat, to be deployed as part of a new fleet aimed at providing escort and communication services to the highly innovative and multi-purpose new vessel.<br><br>From a strategic point of view, the plan reveals some of Israel's visions for the future of warfare as a whole. It identifies a need to be more aggressive when fighting terrorism at its source, believing the new military reality in the Mediterranean, and possibly also in the Red Sea, will show the need for a massive strike capability anywhere and at anytime.<br><br>Together with the top-secret Israeli submarine force, which includes three German-made Dolphin-class diesel-electric-powered submarines, and the overall concept of utilizing high-tech missile boats, Israel will have a strategic tool capable of forcing hostile countries, especially terror-hosting countries, to re-think their relationship with such phenomena as global jihad. In addition, Israel is planning to upgrade three older British-made submarines.<br><br>According to a number of international sources, the main submarine force is armed with nuclear-tipped missiles. It is believed the submarines are patrolling such delicate areas as the Straits of Hormuz and the Gulf of Sidra off Libya's shores. Some analysts believe the presence of Israeli submarines in that area, together with information collected by Israel's spy satellites, played a major role in identifying Libya's nuclear plans.<br><br>The Dolphin subs represent the heart of IsraelÂ’s "second strike" capability. This term is used by Israeli strategists to indicate that Israel will not be the first to use weapons of mass destruction, but will do everything necessary to prevent further development of an Islamic A-bomb.<br><br>One source claims Moammar Ghadafy was pushed to reconciliation with the West when confronted with intelligence showing Israeli subs lurking in his waters ready to strike should his WMD ambitions go too far.<br><br>Naval experts believe Yaari's vision is that of a combined high-tech naval fleet capable of responding to any threat, from traditional weapon systems all the way to WMDs. Essentially the new plan is a blueprint for future navies of medium-sized military forces where high-tech and space-age technologies compensate for the needs of large battleships, destroyers and even aircraft carriers, leading to a more combined force concept.</div>
