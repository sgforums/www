You mean SAF is a cog of your so called common regional security architecture?  sounds funny, being such a cog, obviously you are obliged to fulfill your cog role, isnÂ’t it?

Perhaps, if we were dealing with civilized human beings, we would be inclined to show some restraint against building such animosity, but this are Malaysians. They are less than animals, and we can do anything to such creatures.<br><br>These "people" (a title they hardly deserve) already treat us with little regard for our sensitivities. So to hell with taking theirs into account.

For years we have been trying to work with them to build the trust and strengthen the bond between the two nations. We have been the largest investor in Malaysia for many years, we tried win-win approach with the Johore-Singapore-Bataam growth triangle, many singaporean companies heeded the call of our government to move their factories to Johore, many singaporean bought properties in malaysia.....what have we learnt?<br><br>Individual singaporeans' money were swindled in CLOB, those who invested money in properties either never have the properties or forced to spend all the rents they received in malaysia when they disallowed remittance of ringgits outside malaysia. Singaporean companies in johore were forced to ship their cargo via port klang and later pelapas when barriers were put up at the causeway for the singapore bound lorries. On a larger scale, sea port and airport in johore were built to take away business from Singapore. May be this is business, you may argue, "which businessman doesn't cheat to protect themselves"? But we don't have to pretend we don't know, do we?<br><br>On relationship, singaporeans were accused of jamming up and polluting their city, buying their water resources at dirt cheap price, .....to the extent they wanted to skin us alive like cats.

Our diplomacy policy is not a yes-yes-please-do-not-attack kind. It is the kind...we want peace, we are interested to help each other, but if you want to be funny, I'll make u pay.<br><br>Singapore's defence policy has NEVER been dependent on rallying support from anybody, not even the US. The US's presence is welcomed, to counter and balance other superpower's influence and ideology, but is NOT a defence-support factor at all.<br><br>In MINDEF's doctrine, it has never ever considered rallying help or "tahan" until someone come and rescue...its never been like that - as proven by why we took NS as a top nation-building priority even when our country was poor, we knew we could not rely on anybody.<br><br>Take a look at the defence build up, take a look comparatively, why we maintain a numerical, technological and capability, in multiples of superiority, not just a minor edge...because it is designed to crush any adversary totally.<br><br>Think about why we showcase our weapons, technology and why ministers make certain speeches and publicise that we're a deterrent force, but also a decisive force which will not hesitate to 'defend' (actually attack).<br><br>Think about it...u'll realise ur diplomacy-shit is ignorant and foolish, and inconsistent with real life facts.<br><br>It is also not true that we're not capable....you do not know what u're talking about...<br><br>I'm not saying this in hyper-patriotic mode, but as a matter of fact, many of us here who serve in certain units and vocations have seen the SAF in actual rehearsed exercise, that we're more than capable of a full-scale, combined arms, combined-service war, not in defence mode, but in full-scale assault and we're well-rehearsed and very ready...more ready than our potential adversaries.<br><br>Again think about our mobilisation - proven, we can mobilise more troops faster and arm/equip them real fast. Hardware - numerical and technological advantage. Communications, Command, Control, Weapon systems - everything more than capable.<br><br>Think again...u think we spend money just to "tahan" and wait for rescue? Use ur brain.</div></blockquote>I would agree with you to a certain extent. The trip to Navy gave me a different opinion.<br><br>But... our strengths is our weakness as well. Technology breakthroughs is still much relied on other countries' research. We only improve on their breakthroughs.<br><br>We are very short on manpower and relied on technology to overcome the manpower shortage.<br><br>One thing about technology is that although it can do wonders, I can guarantee you that idiots (literally idiots, not any smarty trying to bypass something) will probably in their own stupid ways bypass the technology.<br><br>And technology can be broken. Technology main weakness is that it relies on infrastructure. Once the infrastructure is gone, there's nothing to talk about. You will be back to paper and pen days.<br><br>There's an email circulating that Russians used pencils to write in space while the US struggled to invent a pen that could be used in space. The idea it's trying to bring across is more than just simplicity does it... but it also shows how a person with a simple mind can be very destructive in the right situation.<br><br>We can have the best... but there's no way to defend against stupidity, which can sometimes be very destructive if the environment and situation is right.</div>

For years we have been trying to work with them to build the trust and strengthen the bond between the two nations.

Singaporean companies in johore were forced to ship their cargo via port klang and later pelapas when barriers were put up at the causeway for the singapore bound lorries. On a larger scale, sea port and airport in johore were built to take away business from Singapore. May be this is business, you may argue, "which businessman doesn't cheat to protect themselves"? But we don't have to pretend we don't know, do we?<br><br>On relationship, singaporeans were accused of jamming up and polluting their city, buying their water resources at dirt cheap price, .....to the extent they wanted to skin us alive like cats. Petra Blanca is another episode they are trying, if successful, tekong and ubin might be their next targets.<br><br>In the history of independent Singapore, has Malaysia ever stand along side Singapore in any aspect of relationship, besides all the wayang at the ASEAN, APEC....?<br><br>You said your piece with your head buried in the sand.
