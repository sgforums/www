            <div class='col-md body'><br>1.) Both Singapore and Indonesia (the nearest country to SOM) will not give u a chance to fully mine the Malacca straits.<br><br>2.) The countries that i list out will surely attack u for what u are doing is destroying their life line. Past grudges can always be settled latter but u destroying my economy means that u are their no. 1 enemy. Dont forget countries might actually take this chance to flew their military might.<br><br>3.) Bombing of Singapore will be stupid thanks to various foreigners located in Singapore. U can only ignore that if u have an alliance and that might mean WW3. Singapore have a small airspace so defending will be rather easy however u are also able to mount a massive offensive at the airbases. Thanks to Aus, majority of our fighters are not located locally therefore u can never destroy all our fighters.<br><br>4.) U might blockade the causeway but to do that u need to move a huge amount of troops which can be easily spotted. I will surely launch a preemptive strike by sending the guards and 1 batallion of infantry and Armour directly to KL while the rest secure J and even M if possible. I will only secure the cities and pipe lines. An offensive will also be launch at the nearest airbase.<br><br>5.) Get a UN resolution on M.</div>

Enemy could play hit and run naval blockade, as long as there is a threat to ships, no ships will travel here.<br><br>To really stop the naval blockade, you need to launch an offensive into the enemy's territory. Then we have to look at who the potential enemy is, geographical locations as to the type of military installations situated there and the regions boost to our long term strategic defence against that enemy.<br><br>Then again, the straits of malacca is vital to global trade, so not many countries would want to see a war happen here.</div>

Proves that I have much more to learn.<br><blockquote>Wikipedia:<br>The cost of producing and laying a mine is usually anywhere from 0.5% to 10% of the cost to remove it, and it can take up to 200 times as long to clear a minefield as to lay it. Parts of some World War II minefields still exist, because they are too spread out and expensive to clearÂ—and theoretically, some of these mines might stay active for hundreds of years.<br></blockquote>Yes, we have minesweepers with modern technology. But I dont believe 4 minesweepers can clear an entire Strait in days or weeks.<br><br><blockquote>Wikipedia:<br>In naval warfare, a fleet in being is a naval force that extends a controlling influence without ever leaving port. Were the fleet to leave port and face the enemy, it might lose in battle and no longer influence the enemy's actions, but by simply remaining safely in port the enemy is forced to continually deploy forces to guard against it. A fleet in being can be part of a sea denial doctrine but not one of sea control<br></blockquote>Keep old but battle worthy ships in the harbours. Of course not sampans lar. Something like 1 LST, 3 DD and 3 Missile Gunboats for per fleet in the region. Put it in port and allocate adeqate AA defense and Air Cover to prevent air strike.</div>

Moreover, I believe that most critical electronics are already hardened against EMP so would have minimal to no effect on them.

While true that in a war you have to beat the arm forces, in Singapore's case, it may not be true at all.<br><br>Cutting off our supplies may work... but as Singaporeans are known for being kiasu... you won't know where we stockpile things somewhere else... a more effective way is find out where we stockpile those stuffs and remove it.<br><br>Lastly, break all communications. Singapore's Total Defence strategy works when communications aren't broken. Break that, you will break the people's confidence + arm forces way of communications to the citizens.<br><br>Oh... and to win... flatten any buildings you see with the Yellow Triangle that SCDF puts up. This one is a real gold for the enemies.</div></blockquote>Wah! mayi, you also come here n post ah? LOL.<br><br>Singapore's vulnerability has also been developed into one of the key strengths.<br><br>Firstly, Sieging Singapore would require control of the seas,  and air.  Both the RSN and the RSAF are one of the best equipped and exposed in the region.<br><br>Without first taking control of the Seas, and Air, an enemy attacking us down from the peninsular will find themselves in turn vulnerable to coast hook manuevers, that would cut off their own supply routes down south.<br><br>Until they nullify Singapore's control of the Sea and Air, things will not look pretty for them.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>National unity, according to the art of war,is essential for victories.<br>Singapore got no such unity because we have no history to be proud of and our loyalties suck ,probably worst in asia.<br>However,we need to score full victory which is not direct arms confrontation to defend or attack singapore.<br>We may need to use spies in so called "pre-emptive" strike to stir up trouble in their government ,military and people (racial issues)and once the country that we supposed would be our enemy is in chaos,we own but may have serious side effects though..............</div>

I think that TD strategy only looks nice on paper though. Cant really see it work effectively during wartime.<br><br>But I dont think our communications can be broken so easily though, coz most of the cables and lines are all placedunderground. Destroying the above-ground centres is possible though.</div></blockquote>Yup, the TD strategy looks nice on paper, but it's also the best one if it could be done in real life. It's pretty well-rounded. With a strong force and the cooperation of the people, the enemies will find Singapore hard to break.<br><br>One major weakness of TD is the reliance on people. Everybody has a major part to play in TD, like it or not.<br><br>Destroying above ground communications centres is definitely possible... and as I've said... just flatten all those buildings with Yellow Triangle... most of them are shelter for us in case of bombing attacks. Flatten those, we are basically left with HDB flats and private houses.<br><br>How long could those last? Not very long in my opinion. Our buildings are built to withstand earthquake tremors, but with enough explosives, one whole flat can go down.<br><br>And given the fact that most Singaporeans don't pay attention to suspicious bags and what nots... it makes the job even easier.<br><br>Condos may stay alive due to foreigners here, but even that is not guaranteed.<br><br>Well... underground cables may be harder to damage, but I figure they won't do so. Communications are essential in any warfare. Enemies would prefer to know our plans and defeat us in that, before removing any forms of communications from us.<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by Shotgun:</div><div class="quote_body">Wah! mayi, you also come here n post ah?
