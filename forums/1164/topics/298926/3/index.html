Try becoming invisible to the 24/7 flying E-2C with about 400km detection range, and the FPS-117 with 300+ km range...and many other radars..<br><br>2. Try flying through the layers of i-Hawk, Mistral, Rapier, RBS-70 and escape being shot down by 60+ F-16C/D Block 52, and 40+ F-5S/T.<br><br>3. Try landing para-troopers anywhere in Singapore and face a few hundred active Commandos, SOF...and even Police STAR team and Gurkhas.<br><br>4. Try doing a "secret" sea landing without being detected by Navy and Police Coast Guard.<br><br>5. Try overcoming a few thousand armoured vehicles, M113 with 25mm, 40/50, Bionix, AMX-10P, AMX-13...SPIKE, MILAN, MATADOR and the good old LAW tube.<br><br>6. Try bombarding Singapore with artillery and not be pinpointed by TPQ-36/37, Arthur radars and be bombarded back by 200+ 155mm and many hundreds of 120mm.<br><br>7. Start thinking if anyone near us, has more artillery, fighter planes, special forces, reserve troops....<br><br>8. Try concentrating or move large number of troops without being detected by sensors, radars, satellite and other intelligence elements.<br><br>9. Try mobilising troops and equipping them faster than the SAF.<br><br>10. U'll realise its a STUPID idea.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>well the main reason why singapore has taken a diplomatic stance in international relations is simply because we can never ever handle a war.<br><br>even if we, miraculously, win it ( in the sense that we successfully defend our lands from invaders), in the long run we lose out due to our limited land capacity and obvious lack of funds to rebuilt (assuming limited foreign aid).<br><br>hypothetically, if a war should ever occur, our best bet would be to rely on our diplomatic relations to rally support from other cts ( eg asean, un peharps).<br><br>ironically, as much as we try to rely on ourselves all these years after the japanese occupation, we're still very much dependent on others now.</div>
