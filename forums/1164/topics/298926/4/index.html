            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by dxdx:</div><div class="quote_body">well the main reason why singapore has taken a diplomatic stance in international relations is simply because we can never ever handle a war.<br><br>even if we, miraculously, win it ( in the sense that we successfully defend our lands from invaders), in the long run we lose out due to our limited land capacity and obvious lack of funds to rebuilt (assuming limited foreign aid).<br><br>hypothetically, if a war should ever occur, our best bet would be to rely on our diplomatic relations to rally support from other cts ( eg asean, un peharps).<br><br>ironically, as much as we try to rely on ourselves all these years after the japanese occupation, we're still very much dependent on others now.</div></blockquote>Your reply sound as though you're very learnt, but you're not.<br><br>Diplomacy works with deterrence. Our diplomacy policy is not a yes-yes-please-do-not-attack kind. It is the kind...we want peace, we are interested to help each other, but if you want to be funny, I'll make u pay.<br><br>Singapore's defence policy has NEVER been dependent on rallying support from anybody, not even the US. The US's presence is welcomed, to counter and balance other superpower's influence and ideology, but is NOT a defence-support factor at all.<br><br>In MINDEF's doctrine, it has never ever considered rallying help or "tahan" until someone come and rescue...its never been like that - as proven by why we took NS as a top nation-building priority even when our country was poor, we knew we could not rely on anybody.<br><br>Take a look at the defence build up, take a look comparatively, why we maintain a numerical, technological and capability, in multiples of superiority, not just a minor edge...because it is designed to crush any adversary totally.<br><br>Think about why we showcase our weapons, technology and why ministers make certain speeches and publicise that we're a deterrent force, but also a decisive force which will not hesitate to 'defend' (actually attack).<br><br>Think about it...u'll realise ur diplomacy-shit is ignorant and foolish, and inconsistent with real life facts.<br><br>It is also not true that we're not capable....you do not know what u're talking about...<br><br>I'm not saying this in hyper-patriotic mode, but as a matter of fact, many of us here who serve in certain units and vocations have seen the SAF in actual rehearsed exercise, that we're more than capable of a full-scale, combined arms, combined-service war, not in defence mode, but in full-scale assault and we're well-rehearsed and very ready...more ready than our potential adversaries.<br><br>Again think about our mobilisation - proven, we can mobilise more troops faster and arm/equip them real fast. Hardware - numerical and technological advantage. Communications, Command, Control, Weapon systems - everything more than capable.<br><br>Think again...u think we spend money just to "tahan" and wait for rescue? Use ur brain.</div>

All flights over the war zone would be suspended, ships diverted. When our enemy complained, the UN would convene an emergency session and call for both sides to cool down. In the mean time, while the SAF anniliate our enemy's fighting forces and its ability to build up future fighting forces, the american, the australian and the Thai might want to take this opportunity to wipe out the terrorists training camps in our enemy territory. When all are done, we will heed the call to cease fire by the UN. Trade resumes, international relationships strengthened.<br><br>Back in the UN, we would want our enemy to repeat after us, before the world:" Singapore is a peaceful country, don't force it to go to war."<br><br>Indeed, that would be the first time, the second time we would change the name of the country to Singapore.<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_twisted.gif" alt="Twisted Evil" title="Twisted Evil"></div>
