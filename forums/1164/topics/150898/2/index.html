The Broncos in APC role could deliver troops to the FUPs and provide supporting fire as well. We did they same thing with V200s.

The V200s added 2x7.62mm GPMGs and one 20mm cannon in support to each section.<br><br>The Broncos have better mobility and is amphibious - the V200 was amphibious a long time ago, but this is no longer practiced I think.<br><br>The British Royal Marine Commandos use a similar vehicle as well.</div>

But I suppose you still need some kind of ship to transport these vehicles close to shoreline cos they move very slowly in water.<br><br>One afternoon I was at Seletar camp by the sea and I watched a group of armour troopers ungoing their version of "watermanship" training in their M113.<br><br>First, the M113 swims out to sea about 30m and stops. It is fully-loaded with a section of troopers.<br><br>Then the troopers in full helmet, rifle, SBO, they had to gingerly climb up one by one onto the deck of the M113. Wearing a tiny little green life vest that fits around the neck, these poor devils had to go into the sea and swim towards the shore. Some got so scared, cannot move and had to be rescued.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>The Bionix requires a lot of preparations to become amphibious as compared to our older M113 Ultras. The Ultras can swim without much effort. This is one of the reasons why we still bother to upgrade the older M113 to Ultra standards instead of replacing all of them with the newer BX. Anyway is the trial Bn for Bronco-infantry combo 42SAR? 42SAR is the 1st experimental Bn to have all M113 replaced by BX last time.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>The speed of Bronco amazes me! That vehicle is like the Ferrari among all the A vehicles which we have. The high rate of acceleration and short braking distance is the best among all the vehicles we have. It is also very quiet given that it doesn't use metal tracks and so can creep up on enemy at night if driven slowly. It can also swim readily with minimum preparations. Its certainly one of my favourite vehicles in Armour.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"></div>
