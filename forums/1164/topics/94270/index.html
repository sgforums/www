They were most often used as airborne early warning platforms owing to the design's powerful radar, and were therefore deemed too valuable to risk in air-to-air combat. In this role, the planes were sometimes defended by F-4E and F-5E fighters. At least some F-14s were lost in action, but the claims of the two sides are in poor agreement, as is always the case in warfare. Iraq claims some 11 kills:<br><br>21 November 1982: F-14 shot down by a Mirage F1EQ<br><strong>March 1983: F-14 shot down by a MiG-21 </strong><br>11 September 1983: 2 F-14s shot down while attempting to intercept Iraqi aircraft<br>4 October 1983: F-14 shot down in a dogfight<br>21 November 1983: F-14 lost during air battle over Bahragan<br>24 February 1984: F-14 lost<br>1 July 1984: F-14 lost<br>11 August 1984: 3 F-14s shot down<br>Meanwhile, Iran claims that the F-14 accounted for 35 to 45 kills against the Iraqi Air Force for only one shot down. Iran has admitted to up to 12 further losses, but claims they all resulted from engine stall during dogfights rather than enemy fire. Though the claims of neither side have been verified, F-14s are known to have accounted for 3 air-to-air kills against Iraqi aircraft, including two Mirage F1s and a MiG-21. Western estimates for the true kill-loss ratio attained by the F-14 during the conflict credit 4 kills against 4 or 5 losses. "</div>

After the Islamic revolution,the US ban all comtacts with Iran.Iran has no spare part for their F-14.I will not be surprised if their F-14 is shot down by Mig-21!<br>A better example to judge shall be the Libya 1982 aerial war.

However, in air-fighting, there is a lot of other factors, not just looking at the jet performance and compare which is better and which is worst.<br><br>Also in war, there is no absolute, even a MIG-21 if able to get a F-14/F-18 to get into a dog-fight and tight turn, within combat enevelop that bring out the best of the Mig-21 and disadvantage of F-14/F-18. Also who knows, a mistake may be make and why not a combination of factors may still see Mig-21 win.<br><br>How could refurbished Russian MiG-21 jets even be a threat to American fighters? "When you stuff them full of Israeli electronics, multi-function [air-to-air] radar, and a helmet-mounted sight for cueing its Python-3 missiles," said a Defense Tech pal in the USAF.<br><br>AND MORE: Air power's dirty little secret is that the airframe pretty much doesn't matter these days," says Defense Tech reader JA. What it does is "provide mounting points for weapons, sensors and engine(s). The MiG-21's airframe is quite sufficient for acting as a placeholder for state of the art toys. To my way of thinking the USAF's Fighter Mafia has never made the case for the need for either the (A)/F-22 or A/(F)-35. Rumsfeld's failing has been in not bringing these overeducated idiots to heel."<br><br>A soldier must remember, anyone with a gun is dangerous, he can have a lousy gun, and does not know how to shot well, but he just have to be lucky.</div>

Also who knows, a mistake may be make and why not a combination of factors may still see Mig-21 win.<br><br>How could refurbished Russian MiG-21 jets even be a threat to American fighters? "When you stuff them full of Israeli electronics, multi-function [air-to-air] radar, and a helmet-mounted sight for cueing its Python-3 missiles," said a Defense Tech pal in the USAF.<br><br>AND MORE: Air power's dirty little secret is that the airframe pretty much doesn't matter these days," says Defense Tech reader JA. What it does is "provide mounting points for weapons, sensors and engine(s). The MiG-21's airframe is quite sufficient for acting as a placeholder for state of the art toys. To my way of thinking the USAF's Fighter Mafia has never made the case for the need for either the (A)/F-22 or A/(F)-35. Rumsfeld's failing has been in not bringing these overeducated idiots to heel."<br><br>A soldier must remember, anyone with a gun is dangerous, he can have a lousy gun, and does not know how to shot well, but he just have to be lucky.</div></blockquote>A soldier can have a lousy gun ..does not shoot well..<br><br>how can he match up against robocop who seems to be better 99% of the time?</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>As mentioned before, the pilot's experience &amp; training is just as vital as the quality of the fighter jet. To say that MIG-29 will surely lose to F-16, is just as inaccurate as saying that F-16 will surely lose to MIG-29 in close quarters.<br><br>We buy what we feel is most suitable for us, end of story. Surely we are not gonna ape M'sia &amp; buy whatever they buy just 'cos we fear that their stuff is better are we?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>And besides, there is no sure way of declaring which fighter is better. Yes, the F-15 has had great success, but it would be inaccurate to label it the best fighter jet in the world. Similarly, the MIG-21 (nicknamed the flying coffin) has had the dubious honour of crashing tons of times (just asking the Indian air force), but that doesn't necessarily mean its the lousiest fighter jet.<br><br>So what if M'sia MIG 29 supposedly "shot down" a RAAF F-18 in an exercise? Does that immediately prove that S'pore is in deep shit 'cos our F-16s are no match for MIG 29s? I think not!!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"></div>
