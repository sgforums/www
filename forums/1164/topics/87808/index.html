            <div class='col-md body'>In surveys done by a certain government ministry, it has been noted that opposition to national service is strongest in the junior colleges. Skepticism and cynicism are relatively widespread among the brightest 25% of the primary school cohort which are found in the junior colleges. Therefore, there is the need to focus such national education efforts among them. Moreover, the Temasek Seminar is not purely for such NE efforts but is also a drive to recruit scholars to serve in the armed forces. Naturally, this means attracting the most academically able found in the junior colleges.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Me.I said that...(*feels the stares of all around).Yes its true.Academics are best at the writing and arguing of policies but to implement such policies, you really need the warm bodies on the ground.This is not to say that any guy in the street can lead an army.The Ops fellas need to be educated in warfare and military methodology while we also need a group of people who are schooled in both theory and practical aspects of battle management.These people should be the ones who are earmarked or be given the chance to run the country or GLCs.</div>

Why have the impression that JC students can only mug but cannot dominate in any hands on activity? Why have the impression that JC students cant fight battles? Why have the impression that JC students are all nerds?<br><br>BTW, how much as a poly student you know about wars? From your post since you had introduced yourself in a rather indifferent manner here, it is certain that you know very little, despite you claim that you do read defense magazines and that poly students should fight battles.<br><br>Your analogy of putting a JC student together with a Koppassu in a boxing ring is totally a bag of nonsense. Why not ask a koppassu member to challenge a JC student in planning and preparing for a total war..., i will like to see the result.  The thing you have to know is, a JC student and a regular Commando have different roles within the army, they are too sensitive to be discussed.<br><br>Im not trying to say that there are no poly student out there who are capable of leading, who are talented in the field of defending. I am trying to stress that the many misconception about JC students is due to the over generalisation of certain ''distinctive'' Jcians. The rest of us are normal fun loving, hardworking, thinking students as most of poly students. Even ITE students have important roles to play within the SAF and the society as a whole, why single out JC students and give them a discredit?<br><br></div>

You got mental problem is it, picking fight after fight in different subject.  You going to open your mouth to suggest that Singapore instead of all going to study, go into jungle to stay for 2 - 3 years ? I can tell you a lot of people who can study well also can use their brain to fight very well in Jungle.<br><br>Talk about the SAR-21 it was build by some brains who incorporated a damn good scope let let you hit your target at 100m, of course the 2 round misses, that is your fault.<br><br>By the way, you "higher rank" in NCC ! let you use NCC rank compare Army Rank you also lose !<br><br>Use your brain ! opps sorry that is something you are lacking off, that I forgot.<br>Yep Iraq have years of desert experience, so what they in the end lost to the brains that create high tech weapons.<br><br>I will take a JC student who have brain to do better you in jungle warfare, at least they are not as moron and immature as you to try to put tanks, SAMs in the middle of a jungle with no fuel resupply to rot .</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>SibeiSuayKia</strong>, it seems that you have a problem with college students. The reason why I don't know but what I know is that you have to stop stereotyping college students.<br><br>You talk as though you know everything. You think you know each and every JC student, which is a complete bull. How about rephrasing your statement? How 'bout pitting a Kompassus operator with 5 years jungle warfare experience against a scholar with 5 years of similar experience. Why not train him up to appease to your 'beefier', 'more well built person', image of the perfect Singaporean soldier ready for war?<br><br>(quote) I rather choose a beefier and a more well built person who can handle SAR rather then a person who read books and is not ready for WAR.<br><br>Obviously you haven't heard of BMT. Where do you think your beefy-can-of-whopass comes from? Five years ago the beefy-can-of-whopass-dude would not have been ready for war. How about taking the whole counter-terrorist team in crappy game of 'CS' along with you. I'm sure you'd have a great time together.<br><br>From my point of view, your post is non-constructive and derogatory to the general population of college students. You being an NCC student should know better. I wonder what it has taught you. You read Pioneer magazine(which is an 'okay' publication by the way) should again, know better.<br><br>Anyway this is a forum so I guess free speech is practised here. I don't really want to get into a heated debate on this topic, so I'll just end it here. I know you'll either read part of this post or ignore it totally so i won't bother much.<br><br>palmerised.</div>
