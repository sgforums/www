              <p>18 March 2009 saw Japan's Maritime Self-Defense Force commissioning the Hyuga Class Helicopter Destroyer (DDH) - the first of two built.</p>
              <p>This event was significant in two ways - it was the first time in Japan's MSDF - or the Navy - that women were allowed to join the crew.</p>
              <p>It was also the first time since the end of WW-2 that Japan had built a carrier for her JSDF navy, and they had to classify the vessel as a 'Helicopter Destroyer' so as to circumvent the Japanese Post-War Constitution that forbid Japan from building any aircraft carriers.</p>

              <p>From these representation of the Hyuga, it is quite clear that this carrier can also operate with the US designed F35 VSTOL type aircrafts.</p>
              <p>More information is availabe from the following write-up of the <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.defensetech.org/archives/003686.html">Hyuga Class Helicopter Destroyer </a></p>
              <p>With the Post-WW2 "Right Wing" elements remaining at the helm of Japanese politics, Asia should be wary of Japan's military development.</p>

              <p>Cost about S$1.5b each. I like the way Japan reconciles this to its constitution prohibiting offensive CVs. A flat top's a flat top.</p>

              <p>Maybe SG should get one of these. If Japan says its not offensive, that should apply to RSN as well.</p>

              <p><br>The WW-2 'Hyuga' was a unique Japanese creativity in a desparate period when she had suffered losses to her vast aircraft carrier fleet.</p>
              <p>This class of <a rel="nofollow" href="http://ww2db.com/ship_spec.php?ship_id=29">Battleship-Carrier </a>was unique only to the Japanese navy and besides the Hyuga - her sister ship in this Ise class of Battleship was also planned to be converted in similar ways.</p>
              <p>They had the capacity to launch aircraft on a very short 70 meter that only allowed aircrafts to be launched with catapaults but with no ability for aircraft landings.</p>
              <p>On 23 July 1945, the Japanese Battleship-Carrier 'Hyuga' was <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.historynet.com/air-group-87-strike-japanese-battleship-carrier-hyuga-during-world-war-ii.htm">sunk by Hellcat planes from US carrier fleet comprising the Ticonderoga, Essex, Randolph, Monterery and Bataan; and battleships North Carolina and Alabama. </a></p>

              <p>As matters stand, China has developed her military to a higher technological standard than before, even if it is not at par with other Western Powers.</p>
              <p>Its aeronautical industry has produced the J-7 and J-10 planes that are far superior than the old MIGs in the Chinese PLA inventory.</p>
              <p>Even if these newer aircrafts are no match to the advanced US F-22 or even the F-35, the vast numbers produced for the Chinese Air Force will overwhelm the limited number of aircrafts launched from any expeditionary force of aircraft carriers.</p>
              <p>In the first place, even if the US industries push for a bigger market for the F-35, will the public opinion in the USA or the other Asian neighbors allow Japan to continue along this path ?</p>
              <p>Will Japan's own citizens allow such a development after suffering the consequences of the Right Wing Japanese militancy that led to the atomic destruction of WW-2 ?</p>
              <p>China's quest for an aircraft carrier is not to threaten Japan specifically, but as a tool to counter what they see as the unchallenged threat by the US carrier fleet that sail unopposed into the Chinese exclusive territorial economic zones that is recognised by all nations to be 200 nautical miles from the coast.</p>

                  other Western Powers.</p>
              <p>Its aeronautical industry has produced the J-7 and J-10 planes
                  that are far superior than the old MIGs in the Chinese PLA
                  inventory.</p>
              <p>Even if these newer aircrafts are no match to the
                  advanced US F-22 or even the F-35, the vast numbers produced
                  for the Chinese Air Force will overwhelm the limited number of
                  aircrafts launched from any expeditionary force of aircraft
                  carriers.</p>
              <p>In the first place, even if the US industries push for a bigger
                  market for the F-35, will the public opinion in the USA or the
                  other Asian neighbors allow Japan to continue along this
                  path ?</p>
              <p>Will Japan's own citizens allow such a development
                  after suffering the consequences of the Right Wing Japanese
                  militancy that led to the atomic destruction of WW-2
                  ?</p>
              <p>China's quest for an aircraft carrier is not to threaten Japan
                  specifically, but as a tool to counter what they see as the
                  unchallenged threat by the US carrier fleet that sail unopposed
                  into the Chinese exclusive territorial economic zones
                  that is recognised by all nations to be 200 nautical miles from the
                  coast.</p>

              <p>Let just assume logically that China doesn't need aircraft carriers to defend its sovereign airspace over mainland China.  Hence, their carriers are gonna go out to sea to do their business elsewhere.   </p>
              <p>A few places spring into mind.  Taiwan is one of them, but it seems like China's policies towards Taiwan is softening as well.  Another place of a little more concern would be the Spratly islands.  All of the parties claiming the islands are unlikely to be able to project airpower over the islands without some form of naval aviation.  Without US carriers nearby, a Chinese carrier task force would dominate the area.</p>
              <p>This does bring into mind the Vietnamese acquisition of submarines doesn't it?</p>
              <p>Similarly, even if the Japanese Hyuuga was to come with a full compliment of F-35s, it would definitely not go knocking on the door of a state with a modern and competent air force.  That is probably not going to be Singapore.</p>
              <p>Again, if we assume that carriers aren't required to defend homeland airspace, those carriers would probably head over to either disputed areas, or states that do not have a modern and competent air force.  In that, it would be the Senkaku Islands, or North Korea.  As far as I can see, it doesn't seem like the Japanese would have any interest in South East Asia and there is little they can do with just a few VSTOL carriers without a power navy and sufficient troop strength.</p>

              <p>lol, I'm saying that if people can think the Nanjing Massacre and the Holocaust were staged events, in the same line of thought, the atomic bombs must have been staged too (and MJ was actually kidnapped by the same aliens that took Elvis and staged his death).</p>

              <p><br>Unfortunately, you will be under estimating those radical believers with your own cynical belief that such radical position taken is due largely to their puny brains.</p>
              <p>Do you seriously believe that the present controversial Iranian elected President Ahmadinejad's brain is puny - as he did deny that the holocaust had happened ?</p>
              <p>Such characters exist in a continuing agenda that remains intact despite defeats suffered, and they are bidding their time to re-emerge again.</p>
              <p>It was the "puny brains" of Adolf Hitler that struck the spark that ignited WW-2 across Europe into Russia, across the English Channel to UK, and across the Atlantic to bring the war to US shores.</p>
              <p>The neo-Nazis are quietly waiting for the opportune moment to rehash the Third Reich, while the surviving Japanese militarists from WW-2 remains at the center of Japanese industry and politics.</p>
              <p>With the Right Wing Neo-Cons sidelined after 8 years of their political guardianship that resulted in a weakened USA, this may well provide the incentive for the Axis powers to raise their public profile to a higher level.</p>
