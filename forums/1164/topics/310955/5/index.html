              <p>In other words put simply,</p>
              <p>in the long run, a fixed 1.5X sightscope is less viable/flexible than had SAR21 started off as a P-Rail modular system which was an option and very suitable at that considering that the design of the SAR21 was from the bottom up by the SAF.</p>

              <p><br>Exactly! We must remember the basic SAR-21 was designed in the early 90s where back then requirements were quite different. Military firearms as well as the SAF's requirements have moved on quite a bit since then and as an ST spokesperson said himself when he pointed out that back then when they made the SAR that 3 kilos was acceptable for an AR, but nowadays it's 3 kilos for AR, accessories, and sights included.</p>
              <p>This is not that the current basic SAR-21 is a piece of junk- it hardly is but as even ST said it's time to move on and improve on the original product. </p>

              <p>It might be possible. The 3rd Gen SAR-21 MMS would go to the manuever arms, while the current generation ones will go to Support Arms, and Training schools, phasing out the M-16S1.</p>
              <p>Note, the Sar-21 is still not being issued to Support Arms. </p>

              <p>To be exact, M-16S1 have yet reached certain support arms. They are using Colt AR-15. <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/redones/cry.png" alt="cry.png"> Sad but true.</p>
              <p>These units are those really small units that nobody wants or cares as they were attached out from the Army to the Air Force or vise versa. Once out of the Army's orbat, they get support from the Air Force who rather use the money on fuel for a few more hours of Air time.</p>
              <p>So in the end, these small but highly effective, highly specialise, specialise skills, highly professional, almost totally independent units make do with AR-15s although they operate In Theatre.</p>

            <div class='col-md body'><p>Eh, most support units have a mix of M16S1 and AR-15s.  Quite normal wad.  There isn't much to differentiate the 2 from in the first place.  Similar generation, identical operations w/ exception of the forward assist, and similar ballistics. </p></div>

              <p>Difference between the M16 and AR-15 is AR-15 does not have a bolt assist. So sometime after firing a weapon you get fouling in the system and the BCG does not lock in. That's where you get stoppages.</p>

              <p>Well, given the spiral system of development that we are adopting, with some new technology every 1-2 years instead of a big update every 10-20 years, you can be sure that what Shotgun said would be very likely, with hand-me-downs percolating from combat arms to support arms to fringe formations in the airforce and navy :P. I'm pretty sure that the "highly effective, highly
                                      specialise, specialise skills, highly professional, almost totally
                                      independent units" that Tancold mentioned would get the new stuff rather than AR-15s though?</p>

              <p>Well, given the spiral system of development that we are adopting, with some new technology every 1-2 years instead of a big update every 10-20 years, you can be sure that what Shotgun said would be very likely, with hand-me-downs percolating from combat arms to support arms to fringe formations in the airforce and navy :P.

              <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong><span class="inside-head">Critics turn crosshairs on military's main rifle</span></strong></span></p>
              <div id="byLineTag" class="byLine">By Richard Lardner, Associated Press</div>
              <div class="inside-copy">HARTFORD, Conn. — No weapon is more important
              to tens of thousands of U.S. troops in Iraq and Afghanistan than the
              carbine rifle. And for well over a decade, the military has relied on
              one company, Colt Defense of Hartford, Conn., to make the M4s they
              trust with their lives.</div>
              <p class="inside-copy">Now, as Congress considers spending millions
              more on the guns, this exclusive arrangement is being criticized as a
              bad deal for American forces as well as taxpayers, according to
              interviews and research conducted by The Associated Press.</p>
              <p class="inside-copy">"What we have is a fat contractor in Colt who's
              gotten very rich off our wars in Iraq and Afghanistan," says Sen. Tom
              Coburn, R-Okla.</p>
              <p class="inside-copy">The M4, which can fire at a rate of 700 to 950
              bullets a minute, is a shorter and lighter version of the company's M16
              rifle first used 40 years ago during the Vietnam War. It normally
              carries a 30-round magazine. At about $1,500 apiece, the M4 is
              overpriced, according to Coburn. It jams too often in sandy
              environments like Iraq, he adds, and requires far more maintenance than
              more durable carbines.</p>
              <p class="inside-copy">"And if you tend to have the problem at the
              wrong time, you're putting your life on the line," says Coburn, who
              began examining the M4's performance last year after receiving
              complaints from soldiers. "The fact is, the American GI today doesn't
              have the best weapon. And they ought to."</p>
              <p class="inside-copy">U.S. military officials don't agree. They call
              the M4 an excellent carbine. When the time comes to replace the M4,
              they want a combat rifle that is leaps and bounds beyond what's
              currently available.</p>
              <p class="inside-copy">"There's not a weapon out there that's
              significantly better than the M4," says Col. Robert Radcliffe, director
              of combat developments at the Army Infantry Center in Fort Benning, Ga.
              "To replace it with something that has essentially the same
              capabilities as we have today doesn't make good sense."</p>
              <p class="inside-copy">Colt's exclusive production agreement ends in
              <span style="color: #ff0000;">June 2009</span>. At that point, the Army, in its role as the military's
              principal buyer of firearms, may have other gunmakers compete along
              with Colt for continued M4 production. Or, it might begin looking for a
              totally new weapon.</p>
              <p class="inside-copy"><span style="color: #ff0000;">"We haven't made up our mind yet," Radcliffe says.</span></p>
              <p class="inside-copy">William Keys, Colt's chief executive officer,
              says the M4 gets impressive reviews from the battlefield. And he
              worries that bashing the carbine will undermine the confidence the
              troops have in it.</p>
              <p class="inside-copy">"The guy killing the enemy with this gun loves
              it," says Keys, a former Marine Corps general who was awarded the Navy
              Cross for battlefield valor in Vietnam. "I'm not going to stand here
              and disparage the senator, but I think he's wrong."</p>
              <p class="inside-copy">In 2006, a non-profit research group surveyed
              2,600 soldiers who had served in Iraq and Afghanistan and found 89%
              were satisfied with the M4. While Colt and the Army have trumpeted that
              finding, detractors say the survey also<span style="color: #ff0000;"> revealed that 19% of these
              soldiers had their weapon jam during a firefight.</span></p>
              <p class="inside-copy">And the relationship between the Army and Colt
              has been frosty at times. Concerned over the steadily rising cost of
              the M4, the Army forced Colt to lower its prices two years ago by
              threatening to buy rifles from another supplier. Prior to the warning,
              Colt "had not demonstrated any incentive to consider a price
              reduction," then-Maj. Gen. Jeffrey Sorenson, an Army acquisition
              official, wrote in a November 2006 report.</p>
              <p class="inside-copy">Coburn is the M4's harshest and most vocal
              critic. But his concern is shared by others, who point to the "SCAR,"
              made by Belgian armorer FN Herstal, and the HK416, produced by
              Germany's Heckler &amp; Koch, as possible contenders. Both weapons cost
              about the same as the M4, their manufacturers say.</p>
              <p class="inside-copy">The SCAR is being purchased by U.S. special
              operations forces, who have their own acquisition budget and the
              latitude to buy gear the other military branches can't.</p>
              <p class="inside-copy">Or won't.</p>
              <p class="inside-copy">"All I know is, we're not having the
              competition, and the technology that is out there is not in the hands
              of our troops," says Jack Keane, a former Army general who pushed
              unsuccessfully for an M4 replacement before retiring four years ago.</p>
              <p class="inside-copy">The dispute over the M4 has been overshadowed by
              larger but not necessarily more important concerns. When the public's
              attention is focused on the annual defense budget, it tends to be
              captured by bigger-ticket items, like the Air Force's F-22 Raptors that
              cost $160 million each.</p>
              <p class="inside-copy">The Raptor, a radar-evading jet fighter, has
              never been used in Iraq and Afghanistan. For the troops who patrol
              Baghdad's still-dangerous neighborhoods or track insurgents along the
              Afghanistan-Pakistan border, there's no piece of gear more critical
              than the rifles on their shoulders. They go everywhere with them, even
              to the bathroom and the chow hall.</p>
              <p class="inside-copy">Yet the military has a poor track record for
              getting high-quality firearms to warfighters. Since the Revolutionary
              War, mountains of red tape, oversize egos and never-ending arguments
              over bullet size and gunpowder have delayed or doomed promising efforts.</p>
              <p class="inside-copy">The M16, designed by the visionary gunsmith
              Eugene Stoner, had such a rough entry into military service in the
              mid-1960s that a congressional oversight committee assailed the Army
              for behavior that bordered on criminal negligence.</p>
              <p class="inside-copy">Stoner's lighter, more accurate rifle was
              competing against a heavier, more powerful gun the Army had heavily
              invested in. <span style="color: #ff0000;">To accept the M16 would be to acknowledge a huge mistake,
              and ordnance officials did as much as they could to keep from buying
              the new automatic weapon. They continually fooled with Stoner's design.</span></p>
              <p class="inside-copy">"The Army, if anything, was trying to sideline
              and sabotage it," said Richard Colton, a historian with the Springfield
              Armory Museum in Massachusetts.</p>
              <p class="inside-copy">Despite the hurdles, the M16 would become the
              military's main battlefield rifle. And Colt, a company founded nearly
              170 years ago by Hartford native Samuel Colt, was the primary
              manufacturer. Hundreds of thousands of M16s have been produced over the
              years for the U.S. military and foreign customers. Along with Colt,
              FNMI, an FN Herstal subsidiary in South Carolina, has also produced
              M16s.</p>
              <p class="inside-copy">Development of the carbine was driven by a need
              for a condensed weapon that could be used in tight spaces but still had
              plenty of punch. Colt's answer was the 7½-pound M4. The design allowed
              the company to leverage the tooling used for the M16.</p>
              <p class="inside-copy">In 1994, Colt was awarded a no-bid contract to make the weapons. Since then, it has sold more than 400,000 to the U.S. military.</p>
              <p class="inside-copy">Along the way, Colt's hold has been threatened but not broken.</p>
              <p class="inside-copy">In 1996, <span style="color: #ff0000;">a Navy office improperly released
              Colt's M4 blueprints,</span> giving nearly two dozen contractors a look at the
              carbine's inner workings. Colt was ready to sue the U.S. government for
              the breach. The company wanted between $50 million and $70 million in
              damages.</p>
              <p class="inside-copy">Cooler heads prevailed. The Defense Department
              didn't want to lose its only source for the M4, and Colt didn't want to
              stop selling to its best customer.</p>
              <p class="inside-copy">The result was an agreement that made Colt the
              sole player in the U.S. military carbine market. FNMI challenged the
              deal in federal court but lost.</p>
              <p class="inside-copy">And since the Sept. 11 attacks, sales have skyrocketed.</p>
              <p class="inside-copy">The Army, the carbine's heaviest user, is
              outfitting all its front-line combat units with M4s. The Air Force,
              Navy, Marine Corps and special operations forces also carry M4s. So do
              U.S. law enforcement agencies and militaries in many NATO countries.</p>
              <p class="inside-copy">More than $300 million has been spent on 221,000
              of the carbines over the past two years alone. And the Defense
              Department is asking Congress to provide another $230 million for
              136,000 more.</p>
              <p class="inside-copy">Keane, the retired Army general, knows how
              difficult it is to develop and deliver a brand-new rifle to the troops.
              As vice chief of staff, the Army's second highest-ranking officer,
              Keane pushed for the acquisition of a carbine called the XM8.</p>
              <p class="inside-copy">The futuristic-looking rifle was designed by
              Heckler &amp; Koch. According to Keane, the XM8 represented the gains
              made in firearms technology over the past 40 years.</p>
              <p class="inside-copy">The XM8 would cost less and operate far longer
              without being lubricated or cleaned than the M4 could, Heckler &amp;
              Koch promised. The project became bogged down by bureaucracy, however.
              In 2005, after $33 million had been invested, the XM8 was shelved. A
              subsequent audit by the Pentagon inspector general concluded the
              program didn't follow the military's strict acquisition rules.</p>
              <p class="inside-copy">Keane blames a bloated and risk-averse bureaucracy for the XM8's demise.</p>
              <p class="inside-copy">"This is all about people not wanting to move
              out and do something different," Keane says. "Why are they afraid of
              the competition?"</p>
              <p class="inside-copy">As Colt pumps out 800 new M4s every day to meet
              U.S. and overseas demand, the company is remodeling its aging
              270,000-square-foot facility in a hardscrabble section of Connecticut's
              capital city. New tooling and metal cutting machines have been
              installed as part of a $10 million plant improvement.</p>
              <p class="inside-copy">Many of the old ways remain, however.
              Brick-lined pit furnaces dating back to the 1960s are still used to
              temper steel rifle barrels.</p>
              <p class="inside-copy">"Modernizing the plant while trying to maintain
              quality and meet deliveries has been a challenge," says James
              Battaglini, Colt's chief operating officer.</p>
              <p class="inside-copy">Within military circles there are M4 defectors.
              U.S. Special Operations Command in Tampa, was one of the carbine's
              first customers. But the elite commando units using the M4 soured on
              it; the rifle had to be cleaned too often and couldn't hold up under
              the heavy use by Army Green Berets and Navy SEALs.</p>
              <p class="inside-copy">When the M16 was condensed into an M4, the
              barrel and other key parts had to be shortened. That changed the way
              the gun operated and not for the better, concluded an internal report
              written seven years ago by special operations officials but never
              published. Dangerous problems ranged from broken bolt assemblies, loose
              and ruptured barrels, and cartridges stuck in the firing chamber.</p>
              <p class="inside-copy">"Jamming can and will occur for a variety of
              reasons," the report said. "Several types of jams, however, are
              'catastrophic' jams; because one of our operators could die in a
              firefight while trying to clear them."</p>
              <p class="inside-copy">Pointing to the report's unpublished status,
              Colt has disputed its findings. The M4 has been continually improved
              over the years, says Keys, the company's chief executive. The M4 may
              not meet the exacting standards of U.S. commando forces, he adds, but
              it fills the requirements spelled out by the regular Army.</p>
              <p class="inside-copy">Special Operations Command is replacing the M4s
              and several other rifles in its arsenal with FN Herstal's SCAR, which
              comes in two models: one shoots the same 5.56 mm round as the M4; the
              other a larger 7.62 mm bullet and costs several hundred dollars more.
              Both SCARs can accommodate different-size barrels allowing the weapons
              to be fired at multiple ranges.</p>
              <p class="inside-copy">The SCARs are more accurate, more reliable and
              expected to last far longer than their predecessors, said Navy Lt.
              Cmdr. Marc Boyd, a command spokesman.</p>
              <p class="inside-copy">"SOCOM likes to be different," says Keys of Colt, using the acronym for the command. "They wanted something unique."</p>
              <p class="inside-copy">With the SCAR not yet in full-scale production,
              Heckler &amp; Koch's HK416 is being used by elite units like Delta
              Force, the secretive anti-terrorism unit. The command would not comment
              on the HK416 other than to say there are "a small number" of the
              carbines in its inventory.</p>
              <p class="inside-copy">A key difference between the Colt carbine and
              the competitors is the way the rounds are fed through the rifle at
              lightning speed.</p>
              <p class="inside-copy">The SCAR and HK416 use a gas piston system to
              cycle the bullets automatically. The M4 uses "gas impingement," a
              method that pushes hot carbon-fouled gas through critical parts of the
              gun, according to detractors. Without frequent and careful maintenance,
              they say, the M4 is prone to jamming and will wear out more quickly
              than its gas-piston competitors.</p>
              <p class="inside-copy">"A gas piston system runs a little bit smoother
              and a lot cleaner," says Dale Bohner, a retired Air Force commando who
              now works for Heckler &amp; Koch. "If the U.S. military opened up a
              competition for all manufacturers, I see the 416 being a major player
              in that."</p>
              <p class="inside-copy">The top half of the Heckler &amp; Koch gun — a
              section known as the upper receiver that includes the barrel and the
              gas piston — fits on the lower half of the M4. So if the military
              wanted a low-cost replacement option, it could buy HK416 upper
              receivers and mate them with the lower part of the M4 for about $900 a
              conversion, according to Bohner.</p>
              <p class="inside-copy">Yet outside of Special Operations Command, there seems to be no rush to replace the M4.</p>
              <p class="inside-copy">Brig. Gen. Mark Brown, head of the Army office
              that buys M4s and other combat gear, traveled to Iraq and Afghanistan
              last summer to get feedback from soldiers on Colt's carbine.</p>
              <p class="inside-copy">"I didn't hear one single negative comment,"
              Brown says. "Now, I know I'm a general, and when I go up and talk to a
              private, they're going to say everything's OK, everything's fine. I
              said, 'No, no, son. I flew 14,000 miles out here to see you on the

              <p>HARTFORD,
              Conn. — When the dust finally settled, Army officials sought to put the
              best face on a sandstorm test that humbled Colt Defense's vaunted M4
              carbine.</p>
              <p>The tests were conducted at an Army laboratory in Maryland last fall. Ten M4s and 10 copies each of three other carbines the SCAR from Belgium's FN Herstal, and the HK416 and the XM8 from Germany's Heckler &amp; Koch were
              coated in heavy layers of talcum-fine dust to simulate a sandstorm.
              Tens of thousands of rounds were fired through the rifles.</p>
              <p>The M4s malfunctioned 882 times. Bullets that didn't feed through
              the rifles properly or became lodged in the firing chamber were the
              biggest problems.</p>
              <p>The other carbines had far fewer hitches. The carbine with highest
              marks was the XM8, a gun with a Star Wars look that the Army considered
              buying just a few years ago but didn't. The program collapsed due to
              bureaucratic infighting and questionable acquisition methods.</p>
              <p>Despite the testing troubles, the Army and Colt are defending the
              M4, the rifle U.S. forces rely on in combat. The tests, they stressed,
              were only meant for research purposes and didn't represent actual
              conditions.</p>
              <p>Dust and dirt are constant obstacles in Iraq, but no properly
              trained soldier would ever let his weapon become so clogged that it
              misfired.</p>
              <p>"This is not what soldiers encounter on the battlefield," says Brig.
              Gen. Mark Brown, the officer who runs the Army acquisition office that
              buys rifles and other battlefield gear. "It doesn't matter if you're
              firing a flintlock from the Revolutionary War or you're firing the M4,
              you've got to clean your weapon."</p>
              <p>The XM8, Brown adds, had 10 cartridges break apart during testing a flaw that can injure the shooter. The M4 only had one ruptured cartridge.</p>
              <p>In overall scoring, the M4 finished the sandstorm test with a 98.6 roughly
              1 percentage point behind the others, according to Col. Robert
              Radcliffe, director of combat developments at the Army Infantry Center
              in Fort Benning, Ga.</p>
              <p>"That is good performance," Radcliffe says.</p>
              <p>But the M4's chief critic wasn't buying the Army explanation spelled out in Power Point charts.</p>
              <p>"What it shows is out of the four weapons tested, the M4 is the
              worst," says Sen. Tom Coburn, R-Okla. "If it's your son that's the 1%
              that takes a bullet in the head (from the enemy) because his gun
              jammed, that 1% is pretty meaningful."</p>
              <p>Colt executives can't account for the M4's poor showing. And they
              hinted that the M4s sent from Colt's plant in Hartford may have been
              mishandled after being delivered to the lab.</p>
              <p>"There's no way they left the factory like that," says Phillip
              Hinckley, Colt's executive director of quality and engineering. "It
              does leave a major question mark in your head."</p>

              <p>One
              of the biggest differences between Colt's M4 carbine and its
              competitors is the way the bullets are fed through the rifles. The
              HK416, XM8 and SCAR use a gas piston system to cycle the bullets
              automatically. The M4 uses "gas impingement," a method that uses a tube
              to push hot gas through key parts of the gun. This leaves residue
              behind, detractors say, and makes the M4 more prone to jamming. But
              Army officials and Colt executives say they've received no significant
              complaints from troops in Iraq and Afghanistan.</p>
              <p><strong>M4</strong>: Colt Defense's M4 carbine is a direct
              descendant of the company's M16 first used during the Vietnam War. At
              33.6 inches long and weighing 7 pounds when loaded, it is
              shorter and lighter than the M16 but shoots the same 5.56 mm round.
              (The round is about the size of an AAA battery.) The M4's compact
              design makes it ideal for troops traveling in Humvees or fighting in
              confined areas. An M4 costs about $1,500. The weapon is used by all the
              U.S. military branches.</p>
              <p><strong>HK416</strong>: Designed by Germany's Heckler &amp; Koch,
              the HK 416 carbine is slightly heavier than the M4, but otherwise
              similar in appearance and feel. Heckler &amp; Koch advertises its
              weapon as more rugged and accurate than the M4. At $1,425 each (2007
              prices), the HK416 costs about the same as the M4. It also shoots a
              5.56 round. Elite U.S. military units such as the anti-terrorist Delta
              Force are using the HK416. Norway selected the rifle last year for its
              military forces.</p>
              <p><strong>XM8</strong>: Also designed by Heckler &amp; Koch, the XM8
              weighs 8.3 pounds and fires 5.56 mm ammunition. Several years ago it
              was being pursued as a replacement for the M4s in the U.S. military's
              inventory. The project was halted in 2005, however, due to questions
              over how the program was being handled. No pricing data is available.</p>
              <p><strong>SCAR</strong>: The acronym stands for Special Operations
              Forces Combat Assault Rifle. Made by Belgium's FN Herstal, two versions
              of the weapon one fires the 5.56 round and another shoots a heaver 7.62 mm cartridge are
              being purchased by U.S. Special Operations Command in Tampa The lighter
              SCAR weighs 8.5 pounds loaded. The command, which has its own budget
              for unique gear, says the SCARs are more durable and accurate than the
              M4. The command and FN Herstal are negotiating costs, but they expect
              the light model SCAR to cost about the same as an M4.</p>

              <p>Dear Editor,</p>
              <p>Until the cancellation of the XM8 program in 2005, Army Times strongly promoted the HK
                                  XM8 for its adoption as the service weapon for the US Army.</p>
              <p>In the recent feature article, <span style="color: #ff0000;">"Better Than the M4 But You Can’t Have
                                  One"</span> Staff Writer Matt Cox attributes cancellation of the XM8 program to "a sea
                                  of bureaucratic opposition." The story fails to mention a DoD Inspector General
                                  report on the acquisition of the Objective Individual Combat Weapon dated October 7, 2005,
                                  which addresses the XM8 Program and is found at <a href="http://www.dodig.mil/audit/reports">http://www.dodig.mil/audit/reports</a>.
                                  This report clearly stated the rationale, which<span style="color: #ff0000;"> indicated the XM8 offered no potential
                                  efficiency over the present weapons systems,</span> as well as including mismanagement by those
                                  persons responsible for the program, both of which clearly may have been a strong
                                  consideration in the cancellation of the program. Another related and informative DoD IG
                                  report is Competition of the 5.56 Millimeter Carbine (D-2007-026) dated November 22, 2006
                                  and is found at the same Web site.</p>
              <p>Cox’s story about the HK 416 references unnamed experts and mis-represents
                                  comparisons between the HK 416 and M4. Additionally, he used findings in an unpublished
                                  draft 2001 SOCOM report on the M4 and a Marine Corps test of the M4 in 2002 without
                                  informing the reader that the Army did not agree with the report findings nor does it take
                                  into consideration the measures taken immediately by the Army and Colt to eliminate those
                                  few problems with weapon improvements. <span style="color: #ff0000;">Instead, the story argues for adoption of the
                                  German manufactured HK 416 for the entire US Army now in use by a group of elite operators
                                  within Special Operations Command who rightfully develop their own kit of weapons and
                                  modify them to their needs. </span></p>
              <p>Additionally, the story very wrongly alleges that Army leadership is not providing our
                                  men and women in uniform the best weapon available and, more disturbing, irresponsibly
                                  raises a concern to the Soldiers, Marines and Special Operations Forces in combat in Iraq
                                  and Afghanistan and their families that their service weapon is not reliable.</p>
              <p>The M4 speaks for itself as to its combat credibility. Before its introduction into the
                                  U.S. Army inventory in 1994, it was subjected to the full range of required Army tests and
                                  evaluations. The HK 416 has never been subjected to any of these official government
                                  tests.</p>
              <p>From fall 2002 to today, government quality deficiency reports for the M4 have been
                                  nearly non-existent. Additionally, from fall 2002, U.S.Government inspectors at the Colt
                                  plant have overseen the firing of nearly 4 million endurance rounds with only three
                                  endurance gun failures.</p>
              <p>The gas piston system in the H&amp;K 416 is not a new system. Rifles were being
                                  designed with these systems in the 1920’s. Colt proposed a piston operated weapon to
                                  the Army in the early 1960’s. Today Colt Defense has the ability and expertise to
                                  manufacture in great numbers piston system carbines of exceptional quality should the U.S.
                                  military services initiate a combat requirement for this type of weapon.</p>
              <p>Cox’ anecdotal examples of fouled weapons are not taken lightly, yet the
                                  information is not helpful if the type of fouling is not clearly defined. In a desert
                                  environment, for example, sand and dust have the same effects on a weapon, whether it has
                                  a gas piston system or a gas impingement system. This issue is completely different from a
                                  debate over a gas piston system operating cleaner than a gas impingement system. Is a gas
                                  piston operated weapon less vulnerable to the effects of the desert than a gas impingement
                                  system? If so, where are the results of the controlled tests? Additionally, there are a
                                  number of reasons for weapons fouling, including the reliability of the ammunition and
                                  reliability of magazines.</p>
              <p>The M16 and M4 have undergone major enhancements since introduction of the M16 into the
                                  US military inventory in the 1960s and they are clearly not the weapons of forty years
                                  ago. These enhancements have improved functioning, reliability, maintenance and
                                  versatility for the individual Soldier and Marine throughout the years.</p>
              <p>Currently, there is a government funded operational evaluation being conducted for
                                  SOCOM by Colt and UCT Defense for greaseless operating parts on the M4 to improve
                                  maintenance, functioning and the wear of select parts of the weapon.</p>
              <p>In closing, at the 2006 NDIA Conference and at the Infantry War Fighting Conference
                                  sponsored by the Chief of Infantry and Commanding General United States Army Infantry
                                  Center &amp; School, Fort Benning, Georgia, the M4 Carbine was listed by the Commanding
                                  General and included in his brief as one of the high lighted success stories in combat
                                  operations in Iraq and Afghanistan.</p>

              <p>For those who wondered what happened.</p>
              <p>Lionnoisy created a clone called "makepeace" which he used in speakers corner to further his own agenda, trying to give people the impression that there are others out there that would agree with him.</p>
              <p>Unfortunately he did a very poor job of hiding it.</p>
              <p>This kind of behaviour is called sockpuppeting, ie. creating a false online identity to praise, defend or create the illusion of support for one’s self, allies or company.</p>
              <blockquote>
              <p>A <strong>sockpuppet</strong> is an <a title="Online identity" href="/wiki/Online_identity"><span style="color: #0066cc;">online identity</span></a> used for purposes of deception within an <a title="Internet" href="/wiki/Internet"><span style="color: #0066cc;">Internet</span></a> community. In its earliest usage, a sockpuppet was a false identity through which a member of an Internet community speaks while pretending not to, like a puppeteer manipulating a <a title="Hand puppet" href="/wiki/Hand_puppet"><span style="color: #0066cc;">hand puppet</span></a>.<sup id="cite_ref-0" class="reference"><a href="/forums/1164/topics/#cite_note-0"><span style="color: #0066cc;">[1]</span></a></sup></p>
              <p>In current usage, the perception of the term has been extended beyond second identities of people who already post in a forum to include other uses of misleading online identities. For example, a <em><a class="mw-redirect" title="NY Times" href="/wiki/NY_Times"><span style="color: #0066cc;">NY Times</span></a></em> article claims that "sock-puppeting" is defined as "the act of creating a fake online identity to praise, defend or create the illusion of support for one’s self, allies or company."<sup id="cite_ref-1" class="reference"><a href="/forums/1164/topics/#cite_note-1"><span style="color: #0066cc;">[2]</span></a></sup></p>
              <p>The key difference between a sockpuppet and a regular <a title="Pseudonym" href="/wiki/Pseudonym"><span style="color: #0066cc;">pseudonym</span></a> (sometimes termed an "alt") is the pretense that the puppet is a third party who is not affiliated with the puppeteer.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>To "flame wars" and "phishing" we can now add "<strong>sock puppet</strong>." A <strong>sock puppet</strong>, for those still boning up, is a false identity through which a member of an Internet community speaks while pretending not to, like a puppeteer manipulating a hand puppet. Recently, a senior editor at The New Republic got in trouble for some particularly colorful <strong>sock puppet</strong>ry.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>When Lee Siegel began blogging for The New Republic, he found, as many others have, that Internet posters tend to be fairly outspoken — and a good number of the posters on the blog were harshly critical. An exception was ''sprezzatura,'' who regularly offered extravagant praise. After Mr. Siegel was criticized for his writing about Jon Stewart, host of ''The Daily Show,'' sprezzatura wrote: ''Siegel is brave, brilliant and wittier than Stewart will ever be. Take that, you bunch of immature, abusive sheep.'' A reader charged that sprezzatura was in fact Mr. Siegel, but sprezzatura denied it.</p>
              <p>The reader turned out to be right. ...</p>

              <p>After making some lame and hasty excuse about his account being hacked, lionnoisy suddenly abandoned all this threads in which him being sockpuppeting was being mentioned.

              <p>This is what happened:</p>
              <p>29th April 0932hrs a "user" called "makepeace" that had never posted before created a lionnoisy-sounding titled thread called "<strong>Oz Judge ban TV drama &amp; interview glorify gangland wars</strong> "</p>
              <p>Already suspisions were raised because the structure and phrasing of the title was signature of lionnoisy. The first post by this "makepeace" was as such:</p>

              <p>Note that other then for the user name, this post is virtually indistinguishable from the countless of other lionnoisy posts we can compare it with. The excessive reliance on the media, posting of hyperlinks, using warped logic that takes issues out of their context, and most tellingly the horrible english which make typos and grammatical errors right down to what lionnoisy would EXACTLY make is exactly what you'd expect from lionnoisy.</p>

              <p>Now this is the funny part, if his account was really hacked as he claimed it to be, he would certainly not be replying back to his "hacked" account so happily in such a way.</p>
              <p>But in any case when he was exposed he made this very funny, frantic and desperate post trying to suddenly divorce himself from the actions of his sockpuppetry by claiming he was hacked. Unfortunately all a basic look at the thread will reveal what really happened, and that is nothing other then lionnoisy was caught red-handed sockpuppeting.</p>

              <p>Anyway, yes, the basic SAR-21 is not the best piece of kit to have if you are talking about how far modern infantry firearms have come since 1996. Just no denying it and that will not change if you drag out the M-4 or the M-1 Garand or the Greese Gun or what have you not.</p>
              <p>It is just a fact of life, our SAR-21 has to change and be updated or it itself will be out of date.</p>
              <p>And this thread is about the TAR-21, not the M-4, how come you are not talking about it?</p>
              <p>Don't try to educate us about the M-4, we know a lot more about it then you do. Some of the people here actually OWN M-4s and custom build their own.</p>
              <p>Please don't try to distract people from your clone incident with your sudden "interest" in the M-4, LOL, it's not working.</p>

              <p>A sock puppet is an <em>additional</em> <a href="http://sgforums.com/forums/1164/topics/mb.pl?OnlineIdentity"><span style="color: #0066cc;">OnlineIdentity</span></a> used by someone who already has another <a href="http://sgforums.com/forums/1164/topics/mb.pl?OnlineIdentity"><span style="color: #0066cc;">OnlineIdentity</span></a> for participating in a given community, particularly when done in a non-transparent manner and where the identities interact with each other in some way. <strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">The term originates with the metaphor of carrying on a conversation with oneself using a puppet in each hand. </span></strong></p>

              <h3>Deception</h3>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>Use of a </strong></span><a href="http://sgforums.com/forums/1164/topics/mb.pl?SockPuppet"><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>SockPuppet</strong></span></a><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong> is typically frowned on.</strong></span> The social convention against sock puppets arises from the <a href="http://sgforums.com/forums/1164/topics/mb.pl?RealWorld"><span style="color: #0066cc;">RealWorld</span></a>. We do not expect to discover that the guy who runs the coffee shop is also our neighbour, but with a fake mustache and beard. In most communities there is at least a social expectation, and sometimes a site policy, that each person will use only a single identity. <span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>Thus, use of sock puppets is a </strong></span><a href="http://sgforums.com/forums/1164/topics/mb.pl?DeceptivePractice"><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>DeceptivePractice</strong></span></a><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>.</strong></span></p>
              <p>A <a href="http://sgforums.com/forums/1164/topics/mb.pl?PenName"><span style="color: #0066cc;">PenName</span></a> (or anonymous posting) is about discretionary exposure of personally identifying information, and doesn't exclude the possibility of participating with a measure of integrity since discretion and deception are not at all the same thing. It is fair to expect that we all exercise a certain measure of discretion, but it is hoped that we do not engage in intentional deception. <span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>A </strong></span><a href="http://sgforums.com/forums/1164/topics/mb.pl?SockPuppet"><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>SockPuppet</strong></span></a><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>, on the other hand, is dishonestly represented as being a unique individual, distinct from the existing identities already in use in the community. </strong></span></p>
              <p><strong>Uses</strong></p>
              <p>By using several Sock Puppets all posting in favour of an idea, <span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>a dishonest person can give the impression that the idea has more grass-roots support than it really has.</strong></span> See also <a href="http://sgforums.com/forums/1164/topics/mb.pl?StuffingTheBallotBox"><span style="color: #0066cc;">StuffingTheBallotBox</span></a>, which is a similar problem in a more formal, voting context. Sock puppets make it harder to enforce "one man, one vote."</p>
              <p>Sock puppet identities are disruptive in conversation because they are often used so that a person can <strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">ask questions of himself and appear to be carrying on a thread between two individuals.</span></strong></p>
