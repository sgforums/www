              <p>Basically its a SAR-21 optimised for close range/urban combat (red-dot scope and shorter barrel) without all the Kiasi-ness safety features, the stupid auto-fire selector, and the funky plastic mag :P</p>
              <p>They already have carbine versions, and I guess, GL versions as well.</p>
              <p>I'm abit surprised at this though: "Royal Thailand Armed Forces purchased 15,000 Tavor rifles." O_O</p>

              <p>Very true-- I was just making the point that the Israeli's have more to fear from a Hezbollah sniper than a chamber explosion, so they decided not to include the safety feature. Possibly they wanted to make it ambidextrous as well and the Kevlar plate would prevent that.</p>

              <p>Another example of you not knowing what you are talking about.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>1. Don't kid yourself, there's no way our 1.5x and LAD package works out to the ITL MARS that comes basic to the system of the TAR21, which is both a reflex aiming sight PLUS a laser sight. The 1.5x scope is a compromise between an open-sighted system and a telescopic sighting system, not bad but you can't beat the target engagement times of a reflex aiming system. The TAR user will aquire and shoot his targets faster then the chap using the SAR basic 1.5x, but it can be argued that the SAR is better for shooting at range.</p>
              <p>BTW, the SAR does come in variants that come with the ITL MARS and similar systems... but unit cost will obviously rise.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>2. The SAR is not truly ambidexterous in the sense of the TAR-21. While it was can be shot left handed when need be, you will be badly injured or possibly killed if the rifle experiences a chamber failure due to the blast being directed rightwards from the safety plate. This is why in the SAF we are all trained to shoot right handed with the SAR, which moots the whole "ambidexterous" thing.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>3. You obviously never ran or trained with the SAR before (or any other rifle i suspect)... carrying by the scope handle and running in battle is suicide because your finger is not on the trigger to respond to any threats. In fact we never handle the SAR by its handle in any combat situtation, even running (unless you really CMI in SOC)... your finger must be near the trigger. I'd like to see you "running for your life" by carrying the SAR via the scope and then turning the corner to run into an enemy, and realizing that you need to switch grip to get your hand back on the trigger... <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Cartoon/teeth.png" alt="teeth.png"><img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Cartoon/teeth.png" alt="teeth.png"></p>
              <p>Please, you "run for your life" holding the rifle by its pistol grip... and in fact it's the way it should be that way.</p>
              <p>In combat we carry the SAR via its pistol grip, NOT the scope... which is the way you would carry the TAR as well. You don't do fire and movement carrying the SAR by the scope handle, that's just dumb.</p>
              <p>And BTW I wager the TAR is easier to handle one-handed because its a kilo lighter... and its designed to be shot one-handed (so is the SAR).</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>4. What's so good about the barrel guard of the SAR? I've tried it, it's just another barrel guard. And if you note the removed it entirely in some of the other more "advanced" variants... what's so great about it?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Objectively speaking, ST did not aim to make a better rifle then then TAR... they were making a cost effective solution for the SAF that provided the SAF conscript grunt with advanced abilities over the M-16 but at an affordable cost as well. The TAR is more no-holds-barred in its solution to the infantry rifle with its expensive advanced sighting systems. The extra weight of the SAR comes from the additional traditional barrel length and more conventional build, but its still a decent piece of kit that I know won't let me down in battle, and of course I've learnt to make full use of the weapon by learning to use the backup pistol sights at close range instead of the scope (quicker target engagement time) as well as shooting with both eyes open through the scope, but all these things are done naturally with a reflex system like the MARS. But I apperciate don't mind the additional length.</p>
              <p>But good luck trying to paint the SAR as "better" then the TAR. Both are unique weapons system that reflect the needs of their individual arms manufacturers. If I go into battle with the SAR or TAR depends on the situtation. But once again, you're are trying one of your "<strong>Bionix is better then M1A2 Abrams</strong>" or "<strong>Mandai UAF is equal to Cheyenne mountain</strong>" arguments <span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>without even knowing the facts</strong></span>. This is quite laughable.</p>
              <p>Seriously lionnoisy... you haven't answered this question all the time you have been here. What did you serve as for your NS?</p>
              <p>Did you even serve at all?</p>

              <p>SAR lightweight carbine</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Note even our Advanced Combat Man system (our conceptual equal of Land Warrior), supposedly the next step in our infantry development... uses a variant of the SAR that does not have the run-for-your-life-easy-to-carry-handle!</p>

              <p>Why is this so?</p>
              <p>As the most BMT-recruit can tell you, no soldier carries his rifle in combat in this way, it is plain stupidity and will get you and your buddies killed.</p>
              <p>It seems the only reason why lionnoisy thinks this is an important feature seems to be that most of his battle tatics involve him "running for his life"<img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Cartoon/teeth.png" alt="teeth.png"><img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Cartoon/teeth.png" alt="teeth.png"></p>
              <p>Once again, lionnoisy pwnage!</p>

              <p>Poor lionnoisy, got hunted and pwned again... he should really learn to pick his fights properly.<img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Cartoon/teeth.png" alt="teeth.png"><img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Cartoon/teeth.png" alt="teeth.png"></p>

              <p>I will pick the  TAR21 with its much lighter  weight &amp; excellent optics anytime over the SAR21.</p>
