              <p>Why in the world would you think that an "officer" it's kinda lau qui for an NCO to out think him.  I do not feel lau qui ... it is perfectly ok ... , I be happy to have NCOs or even men that out think me, which only help me more in my job and make it a lot easier. See that the different in training which result in different mentality and character - i take it as a asset  - while you take it as negative as a disgrace!  <br><br>As for the case here - i did not lau qui for i did put up very fair and valid points and isn't it kind of stupid to take it that by not accept my points is that you outwitted me.  Sometime in discussing a issue - people alway bring up valid and invalid points .... even small may it be ... we go through the brain storming... whatever the conclusion is all contributed to it, does not mean you outwitted someone. Do you go to every brain storming or discussion ... needing to come up winner - so you feel you outwitted peope and not lau qui ...? </p>
              <p>Since you need to outwit people and not to lost face more... then the content of discussion, then really see not point carrying on talk to someone who is too cocky, who is more worry about "lau qui", rudely call officer names - "REMF" which bring shame to his NCO code of honor and selfishness -  just keep focusing on "you and your men" perference, also so desperate to want to outwit an officer for once in his lifetime. I rather end this conversation then have you carry on losing your NCO code of honor .. !</p>
              <p>Bye !!! Please do not <span style="color: #ff0000;">restore</span> to call me names and or say bad things about me - as a personal attack ... to get me to carry on this worthless discussion - for it will just totally reflect on your characters and mentality and your lack of NCO code of honor !</p>

              <p><br>LOL, now you've really lost it <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Cartoon/teeth.png" alt="teeth.png"><img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Cartoon/teeth.png" alt="teeth.png"><img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Cartoon/teeth.png" alt="teeth.png"></p>
              <p>Fair and valid points? In some planet I am sure your style of coming up with points is quite impressive but your weak link is, this is earth.</p>
              <p>What's my NCO code of honour? To ensure that my section have the best equipment to do the job as well as the chance of coming back home in one piece... and quite unfortunately I discover a rangerat trying to pitch the idea that they ought to stick with the basic SAR 1.5x scope that was designed for the SAF's needs 1996 when the SAF (and in fact most other armies) have moved 12 years on in this regard and are equpping their grunts with flexible, dedicated targeting systems. Indeed, this "officer" seems to be more interested in counting his range hours then actually figuring out what the troops in the field are saying, which is kind of unfortunate and well fitting of the title of what one would call "REMF".</p>
              <p>If you read a non fiction book called Generation Kill, I think you'll fit quite well in with the officer characters in the book, Captain America and Encino Man... indeed your method of argument and reliance on qualification-hours when they were pratically clueless outfield make you all good bedfellows <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Cartoon/teeth.png" alt="teeth.png"><img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Cartoon/teeth.png" alt="teeth.png"></p>
              <p>As the point stands.</p>
              <p>How do you justify then the reliance of the SAR in night fighting and FIBUA on the LAD given your obession on anything that is electronic isn't for the average enlisted man? How would you justify then further given the SAF is actually intending to increase the amount of mission-critical electronics in the SAF infantryman?</p>
              <p>How do you justify the utility of the SAR scope in the face of other dedicated advanced sighting systems like red dot, reflex, or ACOG systems?</p>
              <p>How would you justify the fact that despite your stickiness to the basic SAR scope, that armies around the world are shifting to adopting a modular system that can adapt to different dedicated sighting systems to suit the mission profile?</p>
              <p>How would you justify the contuined utility of the basic SAR scope in light of the fact that it is the SAF's eventual intention to phase out the basic budget scope in favour of dedicated sighting systems such as the ACOG or (horrors of horrors for you!) reflex system sights in their implementation of the ACM, which will be the basic SAF grunt for the near future?</p>
              <p>Indeed the point stands as this... for the same reason we stuck with the SM1 tank for so long we are sticking with the basic SAR scope, and that is basically not because the system is really as lionnoisy would say "damn good", but because for now we can keep it on the cheap.</p>

              <p>Storywolf, not to say that you are wrong in all aspects.  I agree that a soldier trained sufficiently in the existing SAR-21 can indeed engage accurately and effectively.  No doubts about it. However, training time is scarce given the shortened- NS, if theres anyway to make our weapons idiot proof and turn each one of them into a Carlos Hathcock, we should consider taking it.  Red Dot sights are one of them. </p>
              <p>The NVG point is also worth mentioning.  The NVG I used back in NS was the one that gave me the "looking through a straw" view type.  Basically, snap down, it turns on, and my vision is as though I was looking out of a tube.  If not for the LAD, I would have no idea how an NVG would work with the SAR-21 standard. I would feel the Red Dot Sight would work well with NVGs.</p>

              <p><br>LOL, I tot somebody just went "don't friend you already, don't wan to play with you bye!!!" and now he's back? So much for heated promises from "sir". <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Cartoon/teeth.png" alt="teeth.png"><img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Cartoon/teeth.png" alt="teeth.png"></p>
              <p>First despite claiming to have hours on the range you fail to grasp the tatical utility of modular dedicated sighting systems like red-dot, reflex or ACOG systems, and now you are attempting to make any sort of a judgement on a book that by your comments, you do not seem to have any idea about at all. Here's a tip... before you come up with a come back, use what they taught you (assuming you are an officer to begin with) in OCS and get some proper intel before you make your comeback <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Cartoon/teeth.png" alt="teeth.png"><img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Cartoon/teeth.png" alt="teeth.png"></p>
              <p><span lang="EN-US"><span style="font-family: Calibri;"><span style="font-family: Arial;">Encino man is a non-fictional character in the book, an officer with which you seem to share a lot in common with, but for some reason you seem to think that Encino man refers to something else entirely and went on to put up some really flaccid palenotological comeback. Firstly the "real" (non GK) Encino man is a fictional character, and secondly braincase measurements of Tyrannosaurus rex indicate they did have a larger brain then Homo sapiens sapiens (which I am assuming you are using as a benchmark for Encino man).</span></span></span></p>
              <p><span lang="EN-US">And thirdy, it's not usually good to make insults based on the forum nicks of people unless your base is strong because they tend to backfire. By trying to use your opponent's nick as a base to form an ad homineum argument especially on intelligence you might want to be careful, because given how your position is getting destroyed by their own virtue, by claiming your opponent as silly based on their nick is pretty much actually saying that you are silly enough to get floored by a supposedly unintelligent Tyrannosaur... which is actually very amusing. Aiyoh sir, take careful aim with your shots... don't anyhow zhuar. <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Cartoon/teeth.png" alt="teeth.png"><img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Cartoon/teeth.png" alt="teeth.png"></span></p>

              <p><br>My point is, before you intend to suggest your opponent is deficent in intelligence, it would behoove you to actually be at a point where you have an advantage in the main debate because it is not enough to simply suggest that your opponent is stupid, if you get outwitted by a supposedly stupid opponent then it is an insult that basically backfires. It's okay sir, it's okay... even OCS makes mistakes sometimes.</p>
              <p>So I have no issue with you talking about T.rex intelligence as long as you are still unable to answer as it is:</p>
              <p>And of course you decided to stop talking about the scope issue, you could not answer the questions as such:</p>
              <p>How do you justify then the reliance of the SAR in night fighting and FIBUA on the LAD given your obession on anything that is electronic isn't for the average enlisted man? How would you justify then further given the SAF is actually intending to increase the amount of mission-critical electronics in the SAF infantryman?</p>
              <p>How do you justify the utility of the SAR scope in the face of other dedicated advanced sighting systems like red dot, reflex, or ACOG systems?</p>
              <p>How would you justify the fact that despite your stickiness to the basic SAR scope, that armies around the world are shifting to adopting a modular system that can adapt to different dedicated sighting systems to suit the mission profile?</p>
              <p>How would you justify the contuined utility of the basic SAR scope in light of the fact that it is the SAF's eventual intention to phase out the basic budget scope in favour of dedicated sighting systems such as the ACOG or (horrors of horrors for you!) reflex system sights in their implementation of the ACM, which will be the basic SAF grunt for the near future?</p>
              <p>In fact you ended up conceding my point, that indeed the SAR 1.5X basic is does not really have any real advantages over modular sighting systems. The reflex had plenty of advantages which you feebly tried to resist (your point on night fighting and reliability was really laughable), and of course the advantages of having a scoped system were better served with a sight such as the ACOG. Indeed beyond the fact that you took a bad position in a debate and have no choice to stick with it you don't really seem to have anything motivating your case.</p>
              <p>Am I a perfectionist? Not really, given the increasing adoption of modular dedicated sighting systems in armies worldwide, as well as the SAF's intention to go down that road eventually, my opinion is perfectly reasonable... you are really the one who is stuck in the rut.</p>
              <p>And my memory isn't having trouble, your english comprehension is. If you notice I didn't say you said "don't friend you already, don't wan to play with you bye!!!" I said you <em>went</em>. Unfortunately you seem to have issues determining what is verbatim and what isn't... <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Cartoon/teeth.png" alt="teeth.png"><img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Cartoon/teeth.png" alt="teeth.png"> </p>
              <p>You ought to be flattered. At lease we could excuse lionnoisy for being plain incohorent... your attempts to sound cohorent and nearly managing but simply falling into the uncanny valley of pseudointelligence is really quite amusing and something that hasn't been seen since Glock.</p>

              <p>It seems to me you are the one who lacks the ability to understand the advantages of other sights, insisting on the SAR 1.5x.</p>
              <p>The gist of my argument is not just about MARS, but the sheer superiority of virtually any other dedicated modular sighting system (MARS, Aimpoint, ACOG) over an budget intergal 1.5x such as the SAR "scope".</p>
              <p>The supposed "advantages" of the sar 1.5x are far better covered in the non-reflex red dot systems (ie. those with magnification) or systems like the ACOG (which outperforms the SAR budget intergal in virtually every department. At the end of the day, the one true advantage of the SAR 1.5x is cost.</p>

              <p>Indeed, soldiers can do with just about any other sight that you can mount on a P-rail. Tactically speaking, virtually anything would be more suitable then the SAR 1.5x.</p>

              <p>If  I had a choice, I will go for any one of the reflex / red dot sights  rather than the 1.5 X scope on the SAR21.Clearly, they are  very much more superior  than the standard  SAR21 scope.  However, SAR 21 scope , overall , is still better than iron sights.  Also disappointing is lack of illuminated dot or reticule on SAR 21 scope. At least M16 had tritium front sight.  To me LAD is next to useless in most night combat - it just gives away your position. I see LAD useful only in a "policing '  kind of situtaion.   </p>
              <p>ST shud have made at least a 12 oclock P rail standard on SAR21 so that "lower cost " 1.5 X scope is issued to normal rifleman. Higher end reflex / red dot / holosight / high  mag scope can be issued to specialist users.</p>
              <p>Better still, shud also have a 3 - 4 X sight ( with range marks )  on a U100.</p>

Firstly it assumes that preferring a 1.5x over a reflex system cannot be interpreted in any other way then the shooter is deficient, which is quite wrong.

              <p><br>Why is it unfair?</p>
              <p>And is it a sweeping statement or a simple statement of truth?</p>
              <p>I seriously doubt is is any more unfair then saying that the Leopard 2 is superior to the AMX-13 SM1 tank, nor are the tankees who insist that the Leo2 is the better tank for them bad tankers to begin with. In fact I think it's the true sweep when you tried to imply that I was incapable of shooting with anything other then P-rail systems by virtue of me stating the plain fact that they are the indeed the better system.</p>
              <p>If I want the advantages of a red dot over the intergal 1.5x scope then we have the option of mounting the MARS or other reflex systems. If we want the advantages of a proper scoping system over the intergal 1.5x then we'll mount something like the ACOG or magnified Aimpoint or something like that.</p>
              <p>From the perspective of infantry operations and the tactical level, there is no question about which is the superior system for the grunt. As I said, the reason why the SAF still has the 1.5x SAR scope is more because of legacy (we have already implemented this so we have to stick with it) issues then actual tactical advantages provided by the 1.5x... which there are really none save cost compared to a P-rail system. And of course even the SAF itself eventually hopes to move on from the 1.5x intergal to modular systems that can be modified to the mission profile befitting its 3G transformation.</p>
              <p>Indeed I am scratching my head... is there really <em>any</em> tactical situtation our troops can be expected to face in which the intergal 1.5x is better then a modular P-rail? And even if that was the case is the P-rail not still the more suitable for the vast majority of situtations?</p>

              <p>If  I had a choice, I will go for any one of the reflex / red dot sights  rather than the 1.5 X scope on the SAR21.Clearly, they are  very much more superior  than the standard  SAR21 scope.  However, SAR 21 scope , overall , is still better than iron sights.  Also disappointing is lack of illuminated dot or reticule on SAR 21 scope. At least M16 had tritium front sight.  To me LAD is next to useless in most night combat - it just gives away your position. I see LAD useful only in a "policing '  kind of situtaion.   </p>
              <p>ST shud have made at least a 12 oclock P rail standard on SAR21 so that "lower cost " 1.5 X scope is issued to normal rifleman. Higher end reflex / red dot / holosight / high  mag scope can be issued to specialist users.</p>
              <p>Better still, shud also have a 3 - 4 X sight ( with range marks )  on a U100.</p>

              <p>In other words put simply,</p>
              <p>in the long run, a fixed 1.5X sightscope is less viable/flexible than had SAR21 started off as a P-Rail modular system which was an option and very suitable at that considering that the design of the SAR21 was from the bottom up by the SAF.</p>
