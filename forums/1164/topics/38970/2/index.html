Rumsfeld said Sunday. He acknowledged a report of a missing allied aircraft but U.S. defense officials said there was no evidence of that<br><br>The Joint Chiefs of Staff chairman said he thought fewer than 10 soldiers were missing in southern Iraq and that military officials were trying to account for them. "Beyond that, we don't know," Gen. Richard Myers said on "Fox News Sunday."<br><br>Rumsfeld said he could not provide any information about a missing aircraft. In Baghdad, security officers searched the banks of the Tigris River, apparently looking for one or more pilots who may have bailed out of a downed plane.<br><br>Asked what he could say about missing pilots, Rumsfeld replied, "Nothing." He suggested that the search in Baghdad was staged.<br><br>"There has been a report of an aircraft missing," the secretary acknowledged on NBC's "Meet the Press. "I don't want to speculate because I simply don't know."<br><br>Rumsfeld said there are some American troops who are missing in Iraq. He noted that under the Geneva Conventions governing prisoners of war, "It's illegal to do things to POWs that are humiliating to those prisoners."<br><br>"There are, we believe, there are some American soldiers missing." He said there also could be captured journalists.<br><br>Rumsfeld characterized the progress of the five-day-old war as excellent, noting that "there are periodic instances when the resistance is quite stiff. ... The fact that there is a firefight, someone ought not to be surprised."<br><br>He said the fate of Iraqi President Saddam Hussein (news - web sites) remained uncertain. The United States launched air strikes against Baghdad earlier than planned based on intelligence reports that gave U.S. planners hope that they could kill Saddam with an unexpected strike.<br><br>"There are reports in Baghdad and in Iraq that he may be dead or that he may be injured," Rumsfeld said. "We'll just have to assume that he is alive and well."<br><br>Rumsfeld said if it turns out that Saddam is dead, the United States would not conceal the fact. "My personal view, I would say that the truth is the truth. If he's dead, he's dead."<br><br>Myers said the report of the missing plane was unsubstantiated.<br><br>"We have nothing to substantiate that claim by the Iraqis, that any pilot has bailed out of his airplane over Baghdad," he told ABC's "This Week."<br><br>"In fact, we checked just before coming on the air, and all planes are reported safe at this point," said Myers, who spoke about an hour before Rumsfeld.<br><br>Myers was less certain about whether there were Americans being held prisoner in Iraq.<br><br>"We're still trying to track that one down," Myers said. "We're in contact with Central Command. They will be the ones that will determine that. And we're going to have to do some more investigation to determine whether that's true or not."<br><br></div>

U.S. war leaders declared the invasion on target despite the bloody setbacks.<br><br>Up to nine Marines died and a dozen U.S. soldiers were taken prisoner in surprise engagements with Iraqis at An Nasiriyah, a southern city far from the forward positions of the allied force.<br><br>On the third day of the ground war, any expectation that Iraqi defenders would simply fold was gone.<br><br>"Clearly they are not a beaten force," said Gen. Richard Myers, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. "This is going to get a lot harder."<br><br>Even so, the U.S.-British coalition fought to within 100 miles of Baghdad and tended to a growing northern front.<br><br>And at the end of a day filled with plenty of bad news for allied forces, U.S. officials said troops had made what could be an important discovery: a suspected chemical factory near the city of Najaf. Authorities were trying to determine whether the facility was involved in making chemical weapons, U.S. officials said.<br><br>Baghdad came under heavy air attack early Monday, even as a mosque blared "Allahu Akbar" and "Thanks be to God," perhaps to boost morale.<br><br>On Sunday, allied soldiers came under attack in a series of ruses, U.S. officials said, with one group of Iraqis waving the white flag of surrender, then opening up with artillery fire; another group appearing to welcome coalition troops but then attacking them.<br><br>Lt. Gen. John Abizaid of U.S. Central Command said a faked surrender near An Nasiriyah, a crossing point over the Euphrates River northwest of Basra, set off the "sharpest engagement of the war thus far." Up to nine Marines died before the Americans prevailed, he said.<br><br>Twelve U.S. soldiers were missing and presumed captured by Iraqis in an ambush on an army supply convoy at An Nasiriyah, Central Command said.<br><br>"We, of course, will be much more cautious in the way that we view the battlefield as a result of some of these incidents," Abizaid said.<br><br>Some of the missing prisoners were from Fort Bliss, Texas, said Jean Offutt, an Army spokeswoman at the base, where families members gathered Sunday night.<br><br>"The mood, of course, is very tragic," she said.<br><br>U.S. and British officials said some of the stiffest resistance was coming from paramilitary guerrillas known as the Fedayeen Saddam and from Saddam Hussein (news - web sites)'s personal security forces.<br><br>"These are men who know that they will have no role in the building of a new Iraq and they have no future," said Peter Wall, chief of staff to the British military contingent in the U.S.-led coalition.<br><br>President Bush (news - web sites) kept his eye on the big prize Â— the removal of Saddam's government and Iraq's eventual disarmament.<br><br>"I know that Saddam Hussein is losing control of his country," Bush said upon his return from the Camp David retreat in Maryland. "We are slowly but surely achieving our objective." He demanded that U.S. prisoners of war be treated humanely.<br><br>With allies closing in, Iraqi leaders appealed for a united Arab front to condemn the invasion but knew they wouldn't get it. "There is no hope in these rulers," Iraqi Vice President Taha Yassin Ramadan said.<br><br>But Russia and Chinese foreign ministers reasserted their view that the invasion has no legal basis and asked for an immediate halt.<br><br>The State Department, for its part, protested that Russian companies sold sensitive military equipment to Iraq in the run-up to the war, maintaining some of the equipment could pose a direct threat to coalition forces.<br><br>Arab television showed what it said were four American dead in an Iraqi morgue and at least five other Americans identified as captured soldiers.<br><br>"I come to shoot only if I am shot at," said one prisoner, who said he was from Kansas. Asked why he was fighting Iraqis, he replied: "They don't bother me; I don't bother them."<br><br>Also, a British warplane was shot down in a friendly fire attack by U.S. Patriot missiles, killing its crew of two, and a grenade attack in an Army base in Kuwait left a captain dead and a U.S. soldier as the suspect.<br><br>In the most notable gain for the coalition, soldiers of the 3rd Infantry Division's 2nd Brigade moved 230 miles in 40 hours, killing scores of Iraqi militiamen who engaged them with machine guns, to take positions less than a day's journey from Baghdad.<br><br>The brigade raced day and night across rugged desert in more than 70 tanks and 60 Bradley fighting vehicles. No American injuries were reported in that battle.<br><br>Iraqi Defense Minister Lt. Gen. Sultan Hashim Ahmed expressed confidence his troops can hold the capital.<br><br>"If they want to take Baghdad they will have to pay a heavy price," he said.<br><br>Several other allied units engaged in intensive gunbattles Sunday. In southern Iraq, a soldier from the 3rd Infantry Division died in a vehicle accident.<br><br>Efforts intensified to assemble forces in northern Iraq, where air strikes have gone after radicals linked to the al-Qaida terrorist network but prospects for ground assaults have been limited because neighboring Turkey balked on becoming a staging ground.<br><br>In Kuwait, U.S. officials investigated the attack at the 101st Airborne Division's command center, where an assailant threw grenades into three tents. Three of the wounded were seriously injured; Capt. Christopher Scott Seifert, 27, died.<br><br>The accidental downing of the British plane was another blow. The Tornado GR4, based in Marham, Britain, was returning from an operational mission early Sunday and was engaged by the missile battery, British officials said.<br><br>It was the third aerial accident involving British personnel since the war began. Six British troops and a U.S. Navy (news - web sites) officer died when two British helicopters collided, while eight British and four U.S. Marines were killed when their helicopter crashed near the Kuwait-Iraqi border.<br><br>Near the Persian Gulf, Marines seized an Iraqi naval base Sunday morning at Az Zubayr. In the command center, Marines found half-eaten bowls of rice and other still-warm food.<br><br>Near Basra in the south, Marines saw hundreds of Iraqi men Â— apparently soldiers who had taken off their uniforms Â— walking along a highway with bundles on their backs past burned-out Iraqi tanks.<br><br>Allied forces have captured Basra's airport and a bridge.

            <div class='col-md body'>The Overthrow Of The American Republic - Part 30<br>Most Forbidden Subject - The U.S. Military Highway of Death<br>By Sherman H. Skolnick<br><br>skolnick@Ameritech.Net<br>www.skolnicksreport.com<br>3-22-3<br><br>At the close of the Persian Gulf War in 1991, upwards of 150 thousand Iraqi conscript troops were going back to Iraq while, in effect, under a white flag of surrender. On the "Highway of Death" occurred the most ghastly war crime in the history of the world. President Daddy Bush ordered U.S. military aircraft and ground units to kill these surrendering troops by shooting them in the back, from the air and on the ground. (Was this done by all-white units? There is reason to believe so.) U.S. Military bulldozers were ordered by Bush to bury these slaughtered surrendering Iraqi troops, some of them still alive, in mass, unmarked graves in the desert. Years later one of those so ordered to commit what amounted to war crimes, told me,off the record, with tears in his eyes, his great regrets in retrospect having carried out such an order. Somewhere between 50 to 150 thousand Iraqis thus surrendering were butchered. The American monopoly press, under "war-time" censorship, was ordered to remove from all pictures any showing of dead Iraqi bodies and to show only blown up tanks, military trucks, and such on the "Highway of Death".<br><br>In the 1990s, on my public access Cable TV program was one of the only places in the U.S. where was mentioned this dreadful violation of the Geneva Conventions, to which the U.S. is a signatory.<br><br>The three leaders of the Persian Gulf War of 1991 were quietly and secretly rewarded, after the war ended by the Al-Sabah Family, the Emir of Kuwait.<br><br>President George Herbert Walker Bush received 15 million dollars in gold. General Norman Schwarzkopf received 15 million dollars in diamonds. General Colin Powell received 10 million dollars in gold.<br><br>These benefits to these U.S. officials were unconstitutional rewards, as shown by the U.S. Constitution, Article I, Section 9, last clause, that provides:<br><br>"No Title of Nobility shall be granted by the United States; And no Person holding any Office of Profit or Trust under them, shall, without the Consent of the Congress, accept of any present, Emolument, Office, or Title, of any kind whatever, FROM ANY KING, PRINCE, OR FOREIGN STATE." (Emphasis added.) [Hey! Does this also apply to Daddy Bush, when President, having a JOINT ACCOUNT for ONE HUNDRED BILLION DOLLARS with the Queen of England in her private bank as mentioned?]<br><br>Other than us, WHO dares raise these same issues? Are not Kuwait and Saudi being protected in Persian Gulf War Two by black GIs with Saudi and Kuwait being owners of BLACK CHATTEL SLAVES?<br><br>More coming....Stay tuned.<br><br>==================================<br><br>Since 1958, Mr. Skolnick has been a court-reformer and since 1963, Founder/Chairman, Citizen's Committee to Clean Up the Courts.

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>`Ghosts of Mogadishu' still haunt troops </strong><br><br>by Thomas Caywood<br>Monday, March 24, 2003<br><br>Iraqi militia thugs disguised in civilian clothes and soldiers feinting surrender before springing ambushes gave coalition forces a taste yesterday of the bloody guerrilla war waiting across the Euphrates River, military experts said.<br><br>``I think this is a preview of what we can expect to experience when we get to Baghdad,'' said John Pike, director of the Virginia-based defense think tank Global Security. ``I think it will intensify as they get closer to Baghdad.''<br><br>Guerrilla warfare tactics pose little threat in the wide-open deserts ruled by armor and air power, but they can bedevil conventional military forces bunched up in urban areas.<br><br>The fighting around As Samawah on the Euphrates River confirmed some of the military's worst fears about fighting in an urban environment. Iraqi troops appeared yesterday to force women and children into a building near a military compound under fire from cavalry troops commanded by Capt. Jeff McCoy.<br><br>``I hate city fighting,'' McCoy told a reporter traveling with the unit.<br><br>And for good reason.<br><br>``Once you go into that maze of concrete canyons, you give up a lot of the technical advantages you possess,'' said Gregory J. W. Urwin, a military history scholar at Temple University in Philadelphia. ``It's very easy for one guy with a shoulder-fired rocket to pop up on a roof and take out a helicopter.''<br><br>The mighty U.S. Army that routed Iraqi forces in giant tank battles during the 1991 Gulf War got a painful reminder of that lesson two years later in the Somalian capital of Mogadishu. Eighteen American soldiers were killed and 84 wounded in an overnight firefight there.<br><br>``You can be sure the ghosts of Mogadishu are on the minds of American commanders,'' Urwin said.<br><br>While acknowledging a ``tough day of fighting,'' top American and British commanders yesterday said their eventual victory has never been in doubt.<br><br>During a briefing, they reported fierce resistance around An Nasiriyah on the banks of the Euphrates River by ``irregulars'' not in uniform, some driving modified civilian pickup trucks. Commanders also reported ruses where Iraqi soldiers showing surrender suddenly opened fire on U.S. Marines.<br><br>Militia enforcers renowned for their brutality and loyalty to the Iraqi strongman, the Saddam Fedayeen or Saddam's Martyrs, also are reported to be active behind American and British front lines.<br><br>``These are the guys who have no future in the post-Saddam regime,'' Pike said. ``These are the people who are implicated in the crimes of the regime.''<br><br>Pike and Urwin see signs that American commanders expected such tactics. Urwin pointed to several instances where coalition forces cut off and then bypassed urban areas.<br><br>Pike cautioned against making too much of the intense firefights between Iraqi guerrillas and the leading edge of the invading American and British forces. While Marines suffered significant casualties near An Nasiriyah in what commanders described as ``sharp engagements,'' Pike doubted scattered ambushes by lightly armed irregulars could repulse the thrust toward Baghdad.<br><br>``I have not heard anything surprising today,'' Pike said.<br><br>While Hussein's apparent new strategy isn't likely to turn back the heavily armored 3rd Infantry Division as it closes in on the capital city, the shift isn't something American and British commanders can afford to ignore.<br><br>``Even after Baghdad is taken, this could be a problem,'' Urwin said. ``There could be a guerrilla war waged for months.''<br><br><a href="http://www.bostonherald.com/news/war/guer03242003.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.bostonherald.com/news/war/guer03242003.htm</a></div>
