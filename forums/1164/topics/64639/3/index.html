Every year during Cope Tiger, a certain Thai prince (rumoured to be holding the rank of General in the RTAF) will "buzz" the flightline with his personal F-16A (specially painted with his personal paint scheme too) at Wing 1, Korat Air Base every morning.  Its so low and fast and loud that the first time it happened, I dropped the stuff I was carrying and there were people 'hitting-the-deck'. He flew so low that I can even make out the soot and oil stains around the JFS exhaust door....  But it happened so often that we got used to it and could carry on with our maintenance work.....

            <div class='col-md body'>Just got the rational behind why SG Navy was going with the 76/62 Oto Breda super rapid gun for its LSTs and Delta Frigates. ( Most Navies inclusive of UK for the Horizon Projects and France are phasing out their 100m/127mm guns for this guns ) Very impress with SG navy planners. Will post info shortly ( And I'm not infringing any secret coz it is from Naval Forces - Monch Publishing ). What bothers me is, If the Delta is suppose to be stealth, why is the gun non-retractable for the stealth 76/62mm turret as in the case of the Visby Corvette ( True stealth feature )</div>

Until ST Engg or Oto Breda decided to develop one (like Bofor did to theri 57mm), one is really stuck with what is out there for 76mm gun. Even the UD 127mm is not retractable. Both Oto Breda and UD instead opted to design a stealthy cupola for their guns respectively. Thus, it is good enuff for the time being. Anyway, Formidable, La Fayette and its derivatives, British Type 45 destroyer, and other stealthy vessels (notice I didn't use stealth, but stealthy) cannot be compared with Visby. The level of stealth in Visby is "first-off" in naval vessels, unless one wants to take "Sea Shadow" into account.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>January 16, 2004: The January 7th launch of the Republic of Singapore Navy's (RSN) first 3,200 ton Project Delta class stealth frigate has revealed some of the advanced capabilities incorporated into these ships. It was confirmed that, when fully operational, the project Delta frigates will be amongst the most powerful air warfare ships in the Asia Pacific region, and comparable to the South Korean KDX II class, the Japanese Kongo class, and the Chinese Type 052c class.<br><br>The RSS Formidable was launched  in Lorient, France and  will undergo outfitting and sea trials in France before traveling to Singapore in early 2005, where she will join her five locally built sisters. Once all the ships of this class are in service by 2009, Singapore will retire its six 1970's vintage Sea Wolf class missile gun boats.<br><br>The project Delta class are based on modified French La Fayette multipurpose frigates, which are currently in service with France, Taiwan and Saudi Arabia. Until the launch of the Formidable, the most potent ships derived from this class were the 4,700 ton Saudi Al Riyadh (F3000S Sawari II) Class Multipurpose AAW Frigate. From the specifications recently released by the RSN, the Delta class will be more... formidable.<br><br>Fully operational, the RSS Formidable will be capable of carrying up to 32 Aster active homing SAMs in Slyver VLS (vertical launchers just below the deck) launchers. The exact Aster variant has not been made public, but most likely will be the 30 kilometer range Aster 15, not the 110 kilometer range Aster 30. Aster incorporates an active radar seeker and reaction thrusters for high maneuverability, and will give these ships a highly potent area air defense capability, with the ability to intercept anti-ship missiles at long ranges. This will enable the RSN Formidable and her sisters to perform anti-air escort duties similar to the US Aegis warships.<br><br>Other weapon systems include up to eight Harpoon anti-ship missiles, six Whitehead lightweight anti-submarine torpedoes and an Oto Melera 76mm Super Rapid dual purpose gun. Secondary gun systems are not mentioned, but RSN ships have recently been fitted with locally developed modular 25mm remote weapons systems. These systems have their own optical and thermal targeting systems and fire control, and can be fitted with various IR SAMS, like the Mistral, to operate as gun/missile combination Close-in Weapons systems. These ships will also operate a medium naval helicopter.<br><br>The base-line La Fayette class have stealth features, that make their radar cross section equivalent to a 500 ton fishing boat, and the Delta ships will be even stealthier. Compared to her La Fayette cousins, the RSS Formidable and her sisters have a significantly reduced profile as a result of it's smaller superstructure and the use of enclosed sensor mast technology. The reduced radar signature makes it more difficult for radar to detect and track the ship. It also becomes more difficult for anti-ship missiles to home in on the ship, or see past counter-measures.<br><br>All her radar warfare requirements are met by a single Thales Herakles phased array multi-function radar system, which provides 2D surface and 3D air search and fire control functions, including multiple tracking, target designation and command uplink for the Aster missiles. Very little information is publicly known about the Herakles system, and the Delta class may be the first ships to carry it. A variable depth active low frequency towed sonar by EDO provides these ships with good underwater detection in coastal waters.<br><br>Combat management, bridge management and ship's systems were all developed jointly by Singapore's Defence Science &amp; Technology Agency and Defence Science Organization, and contain innovative automation features that have reduced crew requirements. For example, all combat systems can be accessed from Standard Operating Common Consoles, which have weapons control functions and a 20 inch color LCD display.<br><br>This enables the RSS Formidable to function at full combat efficiency with a ships complement is 70, plus an additional 15 for helicopter support. In comparison, the La Fayette class has a crew of 164.<br><br>The RSS Formidable's propulsion is via four MTU diesels in Combined Diesel on Diesel (CODAD) configuration, which give her a top speed of about 50 kilometers an hour, and a cruising range of approximately 7,200 kilometers. This will enable the Formidable and her sisters to operate as true Blue Water units. Currently, the only RSN ships that can operate<br>in Blue Water Conditions are its 8,500 ton Endurance Class LSTs.<br><br>For information and images of the Project Delta stealth frigates:<br>http://www.mindef.gov.sg/weapons/frigate/index.asp<br>For a comparison with the Al Riyadh class:<br>http://www.naval-technology.com/projects/al_riyadh/index.html<br><br>--Shawn Chung<br><br>From StrategyPage - <a href="http://www.strategypage.com//fyeo/howtomakewar/default.asp?target=htsurf.htm&amp;base=htsurf&amp;Prev=0&amp;BeginCnt=31" rel="nofollow">http://www.strategypage.com//fyeo/howtomakewar/default.asp?target=htsurf.htm&amp;base=htsurf&amp;Prev=0&amp;BeginCnt=31</a></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>[quote]<strong>Originally posted by 21Alpha:January 16, 2004: The January 7th launch of the Republic of Singapore Navy's (RSN) first 3,200 ton Project Delta class stealth frigate has revealed some of the advanced capabilities incorporated into these ships. It was confirmed that, when fully operational, the project Delta frigates will be amongst the most powerful air warfare ships in the Asia Pacific region, and comparable to the South Korean KDX II class, the Japanese Kongo class, and the Chinese Type 052c class.<br><br>The RSS Formidable was launched  in Lorient, France and  will undergo outfitting and sea trials in France before traveling to Singapore in early 2005, where she will join her five locally built sisters. Once all the ships of this class are in service by 2009, Singapore will retire its six 1970's vintage Sea Wolf class missile gun boats.<br><br>The project Delta class are based on modified French La Fayette multipurpose frigates, which are currently in service with France, Taiwan and Saudi Arabia. Until the launch of the Formidable, the most potent ships derived from this class were the 4,700 ton Saudi Al Riyadh (F3000S Sawari II) Class Multipurpose AAW Frigate. From the specifications recently released by the RSN, the Delta class will be more... formidable.<br><br>Fully operational, the RSS Formidable will be capable of carrying up to 32 Aster active homing SAMs in Slyver VLS (vertical launchers just below the deck) launchers. The exact Aster variant has not been made public, but most likely will be the 30 kilometer range Aster 15, not the 110 kilometer range Aster 30. Aster incorporates an active radar seeker and reaction thrusters for high maneuverability, and will give these ships a highly potent area air defense capability, with the ability to intercept anti-ship missiles at long ranges. This will enable the RSN Formidable and her sisters to perform anti-air escort duties similar to the US Aegis warships.</strong><br><br>not really true. in air warfare terms our Deltas will be nowhere near its Asian rivals unless we get Aster 30 or at least ESSM, which at least has a longer range than Aster 15. again, no way will they be capable of area air defense or Aegis-style aintiair escort duties. not unless we get Aster 30.<br><br>personally i'm very in favour of acquiring Aster 30 for the Deltas. even though it could upset the neighbours, it will give the Deltas great long-range firepower unprecedented in RSN history... IMO it could just be the long-awaited replacement for our Bloodhound SAMs as well in the long-range air defense role!!<br><br>any thots?</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>got this from FAS website  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br><br>"Aster 15<br>Aster 30<br>Eurosam is a Franco-Italian joint venture created by the French companies Aerospatiale and Thompson-CSF and the Italian firm Alenia/Finmeccanica in order to develop the anti-missile programme FSAF (Future Surface-to-Air Family), which is organised around the Franco-Italian missile Aster. This family has a naval component, the PAAMS (Horizon program) and a mobile land component to be mounted on vehicles which is currently under development.<br><br><strong>The two versions of the missile differ only in the size of their first booster stage and, consequently, their range: from 1.7 to 30 km in the case of the Aster 15, and from three to 80 km in the case of the Aster 30.</strong>  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"> When it enters service, the Aster will be the Western World's first surface-to-air missile with active guidance. The Aster is capable of load limits of 60 G in its terminal phase thanks to its aerodynamic pilot, in addition to which there are impulses from lateral jets at the center of gravity, making last-minute corrections of trajectory possible at the moment of interception. That capability makes the Aster unique in the world.<br>In December 1997 Aerospatiale announced two significant firing tests of Aster 15 and Aster 30 missiles. In the first test an Aster 15 successfully intercepted a sea-skimming target in a very high electronic countermeasures environment. The Aster scored what the French immediately called a "Hit-to-Kiss". Aster's impact point was under a meter from its target's center of gravity. On 11 December 1997, an Aster 30 ground launched missile underwent s its first validation firing against a real target. The intercept occurred at a distance of 16.2 nm. (30 km) from the launch point at an altitude of 36,000 ft (11,000 meters). The C22 target was flying at Mach 0.84 (900 km/h) and the Aster 30 intercepting the target head-on and from above at Mach 2.68. The recorded miss-distance was less than 4 meters.<br><br>Aster is capable of evolving in the direction of an antiballistic role in the future. The missile would be able to deal with ballistic missiles with a range of 1,000 km as they reenter the atmosphere. The homing head would have to be made more powerful or its algorithms speeded up, considering the approach speeds involved. The field of the proximity fuze would have to be reduced from 60o to 30o to increase its sensitivity, and fragmentation of the explosive charge would have to be adjusted to produce larger fragments.<br><br>The Principal Anti-Air Missile System (PAAMS) is a new surface-to-air missile system, developed essentially to provide medium-range air defence and anti-missile protection for high-value units, such as aircraft carriers or merchant tankers, in the vicinity of the escort. The Horizon air defence frigate project involves France, Italy and the United Kingdom. The program covers the ship and secondary weapon systems, and PAAMS. the PAAMS has not suffered from London's recent decision to withdraw from the Horizon frigates program. The Horizon International Joint Venture Co., the prime contractor designated for the program, is owned by the French firm Direction des Constructions Navales (DCN) International, the British firm GEC-Maritime Ltd., and the Italian company Orrizonte SpA. The operational specifications for the frigate were set out in the "Trilateral Staff Requirements" document signed in 1992. However, the partners encountered major difficulties in their efforts to reach agreement on the operational capabilities of the missile system. "</div>
