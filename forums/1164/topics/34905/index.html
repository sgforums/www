            <div class='col-md body'>The British government has informed Singapore it would be able to permanently station a squadron of Eurofighter Typhoon combat aircraft in the U.K. if it was selected as the winner of Singapore's ongoing fighter competition.<br><br>The Republic of Singapore Air Force (RSAF) intends to replace its aging A-4SU Skyhawks around 2007. An initial batch of 20 aircraft could be purchased, along with follow-on orders to replace the air force's F-5s.<br><br>Given the extremely restrictive nature of the national airspace the RSAF has for training, part of the fighter requirement has looked at extra-national basing options to meet training needs.<br><br>A British government official confirmed that Singapore had been advised that the U.K. is "prepared to offer basing." He added, however, that at this stage no air force base had yet been identified as the likely home of any RSAF unit.<br><br>The RSAF already has a jet training facility at Cazuax in the south of France, where A-4SU aircraft are deployed.<br><br>Singapore is now expected to issue a request for proposals--likely to three final contenders--by the end of the first or start of the second quarter of this year. A final selection would follow in 2004.<br><br>The RSAF has been considering the Boeing F-15S and F/A-18E/F, the Block 60 variant of the F-16, the Dassault Rafale, a Sukhoi Su-27 derivative and the Eurofighter Typhoon. Some analysts and industrialists here suggest both the Rafale and Typhoon could go ahead to the final phase of the competition, along with a U.S. platform.<br><br>Eurofighter officials admit that in the wake of the loss of one of the seven prototypes--the two-seat DA-6--they received numerous questions from the RSAF. However, given that the loss has been ascribed to a known issue with a very early "hand-built" version of the EJ200 engine, they maintain this will not have any impact on the outcome of the RSAF selection process.<br><br>Alongside the training requirement, the RSAF, according to industry sources close to the competition, would also like the ability to independently integrate air-to-air and air-to-surface weapons on the selected aircraft.<br><br>In terms of guided weaponry, Singapore has looked not only to the U.S. but also to Israel as a source of air-to-air missiles. It is widely held, though not confirmed officially, that the RSAF was one of the first export customers for the Israeli Python-4 high-agility dogfight missile. This missile is being integrated on RSAF's F-16 aircraft.<br><br>Alongside the Python-4, there remains the possibility the RSAF has also looked to Israel as an alternative source of an active radar-guided missile in the shape of what is known for export as Derby. It has also bought the AIM-120 Advanced Medium Range Air-to-Air Missile from Raytheon. These remain stored in the U.S.<br><br>Whether all three of the final contenders will be able to guarantee the RSAF the ability to independently integrate weaponry remains problematic. Such a capability would require a level of software access that Washington previously has been loath to give.<br><br>In the case of air-to-surface weaponry, both the Rafale and the Typhoon could be offered with a derivative of the Scalp EG/Storm Shadow cruise missile. Again, whether the U.S. would sanction the release of a weapon with a similar range--export derivatives of the Anglo-French missile have a range on the order of 400 km. (248 mi.)--also remains in doubt.<br><br>Aviation Week - 10 Feb 03</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Malaysia seeks new Russian, US fighter jets<br><br>KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) - Malaysia hopes to sign deals later this year to buy Russian and U.S.-made fighter jets in a major boost for its air force, authorities said Monday.<br><br>Officials are negotiating the price and mode of payment for an undisclosed number of Boeing's U.S.-made Super Hornet FA-18F fighter jets and Russian company Sukhoi's Su-30 military aircraft, said Lt. Gen. Abdullah Ahmad, deputy chief of Malaysia's air force.<br><br>Abdullah said the purchases would bolster Malaysia's existing fleet of 18 Russian MiG-29 fighters, eight FA-18D Hornets, seven F-5 Tigers and eight British-built Hawk jets.<br><br>The proposed defense contracts would be this Southeast Asian country's largest since spending about 6 billion ringgit (dlrs 1.6 billion) last year on European and Russian-made hardware ranging from rifles and missiles to its first submarines.<br><br>Defense Minister Najib Razak said Malaysia might sign agreements worth billions of ringgit (hundreds of millions of dollars) to buy military and civilian aircraft at a September showcase for defense manufacturers on Malaysia's northern Langkawi island.<br><br>Najib declined to specify the type and number of aircraft, but defense officials speaking on condition of anonymity said these would likely include the Super Hornets and Su-30.<br><br>Officials have said Malaysia's neighbors should not be nervous about the defense boost, since the purchases are part of plans put on hold in 1997 by the Asian financial crisis. - AP<br><br><a href="http://thestar.com.my/news/story.asp?file=/2003/2/10/latest/10162Malaysias&amp;sec=latest" rel="nofollow">http://thestar.com.my/news/story.asp?file=/2003/2/10/latest/10162Malaysias&amp;sec=latest</a></div>

This event is a  milestone for the Eurofighter Typhoon programme as it approaches Entry to Service.<br><br>The first Series Production Aircraft will now undergo a process of clearances for Type Acceptance leading to qualification of the Eurofighter Typhoon Weapon System. Training and Support for air crew and maintenance personnel has already begun at different locations across the partner nations in anticipation of Entry to Service. The Eurofighter Typhoon Weapon System will form the backbone of NATO Air Power for a new generation of swing/multi-role aircraft that will be in service for at least 40 years.<br><br>Commenting on events Filippo Bagnato, Chief Executive Officer, Eurofighter GmbH, stated Â‘This  milestone marks a change in the Eurofighter programme. We are in full series production with more than 90 aircraft already on the line. In addition, plans for development of enhanced versions of the Weapon System are well advanced, with significant interest from the European partner air forces and potential export countries.<br><br>The flights are a prelude to Entry to Service and the realisation of a major undertaking by the European industrial partners in establishing a world class industry for military aircraft in the global market.'<br><br>Commenting for NATO Eurofighter and Tornado Management Agency (NETMA), General Emilio Poyo Guerrero stated Â‘The flights of our SPAs are a step forward and a sign of progress in our programme.
