Singapore may not win by attrition given we do not have the strategic depth (and breath) to scattle the howitzers. What SAF must do in the early stage of the conflict is to throw as much "sh**t" at the enemies sufficient to destroy the immediate and nearest threats, and for te Guards and amoured units to cross over to the enemy's side to gain strategic depth. After that, the arty guns will then have the safety of not being at the receiving end of enemy's arty fire. Thus, I believe that having MLRS system will only help SAF to achieve that quicker. The first 24 hours of any aggression will see SAF needing to quickly achieve a 50km buffer zone around Singapore... otherwise, we are all doomed !!!! The next 48 hours, SAF will need to acquire another 50 Km buffer zone, essentially to make up the 100KM zone around Singapore.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I came across a book about Singapore's military and from reading it many times, i came across a section, stating that sg in the past, was interested in the MLRS system similar to the US but fearing that it will introduce a new capability (which I dubbed Ballistic Range Artillery Capability) to the SEA region, the idea was scrapped.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>For wat i know , Indonesia will not be likely to join in the war between Singapore and Malaysia.<br>Mainly because of her weak economy , small amount of soldier to landspace ratio , inferior weaponary , and political reasons. Logically , she wont want to risk a drop in economy again and risking her mans jus for another country , where at the same time some parts of indonesia is experiencing internal dispute.</div>
