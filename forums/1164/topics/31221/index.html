But if SAF is serious to get big bang arty rockets or SSMs, then its better to get either the US MLRS or HIMARS systems with the ATACMS missiles.

The surface to surface missiles is another story though.<br><br>The differences in the effect of 155mm gun and MLRS are quite major.

IF all fail... assuming that the ASTRO2 manage to avoid SAF hunt and continue to hit singapore hard... SAF can do a tit for tat and start dropping ICMs all over southern Johor and perhaps use its Airpower to visit horror in KL and other major malaysian cities with ICM bombs, LGBs, Iron bomb, Napalm or even maybe some coloured gas....which would sure as hell scare their shits off even if it is not poison gas <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>as for the SS21 scarab... the news has been reported before in janes' defence weekly in 1995(if i remeber correctly) where the ruskies reportedly provided SAF with informations such as technical specs and others for evalutions...<br><br>However... eversince then... there has been no news about the 'interest'...<br><br>either the americans put a stop to it... OR it might have been called off for other reason...<br><br>as far as i know... there is no scarab in singapore...<br><br>as to why SAF was interested in scarab... that i dont know... but it sure was not becos of ASTRO2... as their interest in scarab (if true) was reported way before malaysia even have intentions to purchase the ASTRO2...<br><br>maybe the scarab was meant for the nukes that the aussies intelligience claim that is in SAF possession and SAF believe that it needs a platform to deliver it???</div>

It should be a very interesting development for SAF to seriously consider buying it. It will out gun  any Malaysian Arty or even their Astro. For the Malaysian, it just too bad that they cannot buy the weapon coz it from Israel<br><br>http://www.defense-update.com/news/6702ermap.htm<br><br>Israel Military Industry is developing an extended range, modular, artillery projectile (ERMAP) that will be able to reach distances of up to 80 km without increasing the firing pressures in the barrel. The developers are planning to achieve this effect by deploying aerodynamic surfaces and autonomous guidance, based on Global Satellite Positioning (GPS) inside the projectile. The new ammunition is designed to hit target at such range, with accuracy of 30 CEP, good enough for effective attack by scatterable munitions or smart submunitions.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>in an arty shooting match, Singapore will win by attrition if both sides are evenly matched, Sg has alot more of those 52 cal 155mm guns than M'sia, plus old US models in reserve, btw, what about the chassis of the Paladin Sg bought recently?? if they fit a FH2000 gun on it, it can probably serve as a sort of backliner for the tanks and AFVs needing an arty strike in front, but i'm not sure how the LWSPH and the Paladin chassis arty will complement each other. . . and how do the normal FH2000 move anyway??? tow? by what? they got an auxillary diesel on board issit?</div>
