Range... barak's range of 10km... would require the scud to be heading towards barak's envelope of fire to enable the barak to intercept it.. isreal is a big country... it is doubtful... the isrealis would put barak all over isreal in order to catch every scud that is going to hit isreal...its equivalent to putting a barak launcher every 5km in all directions... its crazy and expensive...<br><br>2...

Barak's size is very small compare with the scud which is an SRBM and the weight of the scud... plus its velocity prior to impact would be so high... a barak's intercept is gonna be like throwing pebbles at a charging tank....<br><br>3... you cant place barak at the border and assume that the barak can be use to form a wall... because ... an SRBM usually attacks from a very very high altitude... an altitude.. which i believe the barak are not designed for...<br><br>Patriot on the other hand has 10x the range of barak and its much much bigger...the radar and other subcomponent also play a crucial role in interceptions... which the barak system were not design for.... at such ranges...<br><br>But.. against MRLS... fired at small small singapore... i think barak would be suitable.....becos MRLS rockets are small... probably smaller then a Anti ship missile... flys at a lower speed compare to a SRBM and do not have a high parabolic flight path without compromising range....</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>1. scud is a low altitude ballastic missile with a single warhead flying clumsily in slow speed.  israel deployed patriot in certain points of the country to protect ONLY 2 cities. to protect the entire country, israel most probably has to deploy patriot systems all over the land.<br><br>2. if barak interecept to a scud is like thowing pebbles at a charging tank,  it is to say intercepting a mrls rocket with barak is like throwing eggs at a incoming stone... hoping it will hit it and stop it.<br><br>3.  as i say again... scud is a low altitude slow speed BM.  if barak can't intercept a slow flying pig at point defence... it can't intercept something smaller and faster.<br><br>don't forget, till now israel still can't intercept a single katyusha attack.  for 20 years, only a prototype laser defence system jointly developed by israel and us to intercept katysha was tested and then threw into the dustbin.  israel found the best way to destroy katyusha is to stop it from launching using uav to search and call for f-16 air strike.<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by tripwire:</div><div class="quote_body">there are a few reasons why barak cant stop a scud...<br><br>1....
