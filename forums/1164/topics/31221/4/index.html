            <div class='col-md body'>I've never seen so much speculative bullshit in mylife. Some clarification:<br><br>The G5 155mm how is a 45 calibre howitzer. The range is 30km using standard projectiles and 39km using base-bleed projectiles. This is slightly lower than FH2000 reported 42km max range using base-bleed projectiles.<br><br>As for Astros II, it was reported that the rockets purchased up north are the SS-60/SS-80 types. These have the max range of 80km. Cargo munitions are not exclusive to just S'pore. Denel's also sells cargo munitions for the G5 how.<br><br>So far no one have been successful in shooting down rockets (and this includes the Israelis). It is also not feasible to use an expensive missile (like a barak etc) to shoot down a cheap rocket.<br><br>Finally, if they guys up north really want to get nasty, they can always use the radioactive wastes from their nuclear reactor at PUSPATI, to mix it up with explosive for the shells of their Astros rocket or 155mm shells to create a "dirty" bomb and fire it indiscriminately.</div>

If we fail to destroy the MLRS first and the first salvo hit our ground , the consequence on our side is horrible.<br><br>*note that they  have only 18 MLRS pieces for the whole two territory , the rockets they can fire in one salvo isnt that difficult and expensive ( compare to losing the whole airbase ) to shoot down.<br><br>ermmm  i dun realli understand wat u mean by the ''mersing line'' in ur post.<br><br></div>

Until a 2000 Ib bomb is needed....! Not worth it la....thing something creative then that la....<br><br>I thought this tread is the astross MLRS?<br><br>Anyhow my point is most modern sam with good fire control radar can track &amp; destroy projectile or something moving in the air with a good probibility.<br><br>Even a seawolf managed to stop a 4.5 in shell in flight....and that test was conducted in 80ies+ or so.<br><br>The question is was it worth doing it? Then why do you built underground facilities and some of your over or underpass is such "location" around your country in the first place.<br><br>Well at least your Apache &amp; F16 have to find it first. That a lot of place to hide in your or what so ever "Mersing Line"!!!! </div></blockquote>simi mersing line.... so outdated....<br><br>Now SAF doctrine change liow... NO MORE LINE... its all the way in... chiong ga liow....<br><br>And no need to hide lah... we got so many spies in malaysia... who knows.. maybe the MRLS commander is a singapore sleeper... turn the rocket around and shoot KL... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>18 astros for KMs long of coast.......?( theres a possiblity ) I believe it will be a failure.<br><br>I believe Astros are bought to conduct stratigical attacks onto Singapore , maximising our archillies heel which is more a success then the coasten defence role.<br><br>If they will to protect the coast by using MLRS , they will have to destroy everything that we set foot on. Maybe if the soldiers are stationed in a coasten city , they will most likely have to destroy that part of the city too.If they will to plan to destroy the troops on the beach landings, then their  friendly defence troops on the beach may be in danger too. If they plan to destroy the ships , the unguided rockets could do much little on mobile ships with missile defense system y not get land-based exocet.<br><br>Of course there is exception in stratigics .</div>

They could pose a problem if we lose air superiority. If they do fire, we could counterbattery them or pop them with a manverick or two. Heh heh, better, call in 75mm and 90mm fire from the Navy, if the range is close enuff.
