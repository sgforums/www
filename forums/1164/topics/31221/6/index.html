            <div class='col-md body'>eh......to all malaysians.<br><br>The astros undoubfully is one of the major threats malaysia can post to singapore. However toking abt major threat , i cant think of any other weapon malaysia have other than the astros that can shake us ( SU-30s maybe....).........<br><br>And pls be reminded or shall i tell u , do not think that the rockets are some-sort of god-given weapon . I had came to notice , u malaysian love ur rockets so much that in almost every reply of almost every thread, u all are boosting it. ....( damm sian u know? ) happens in sgforums and also in other defence forum.<br><br>Be reminded that logically for wat we have been doing for 35 yrs , Singapore will never sit down and say ''oh they have rockets , we are f-u-c-ked !''......<br><br>Pls also be reminded , rockets can be countered by SAMs or ''lasers" , so ur rockets now arent some god-blessed toys.....they are not immued by LGBs too.....<br><br>Pls be reminded too , that Singapore's pre-emptive strike doctrine is to prevent any attack onto Singapore's main shore. The pre-emptives strike doctrine was here b4 u have the rockets , with the rockets , we will still do the same with onli one more weapon on our kill-list.....<br><br>too be continue...............son!</div>

An upgrade of something we had for years and is going to be discarded soon. Wow. Soo <span style="font-style: italic;">scared</span>. Capabilities of the system, we know almost full well. Missiles also the same. Just a short range air-defense system only, say until like invincible weapon. Got shame or not?

Wah biang, very innovative. Air defense system hidden in a hangar where our satellites cannot see. What air defense system? Your ballistic technicians. I heard RMAF perfected the technique of launching technicians from aircraft ejection seats at RSAF planes while RMAF plane still in hanger.  Wah lau.

Being wack by a ship 10x her size , and still wont sink , that is durable. This incident also proves that people in Singapore can stand together in the times of such crisis.

            <div class='col-md body'>As usual, Malaysians are great on rethoric, but lacking on facts. Singaporeans prefer to make their point known with facts, in this case, bullets.<br><br>Even the Malaysian commanders agree (those are the ones in the hotseat, not loudmouth poppycock talkers that anyhow shoot their mouth off trademarked Malaysian style) that in any conflict, Singapore would have the advantage in technology, and also in general quality of the armed forces. So much so they proposed having to resort to means which would have the UN/US kicking their economic butt 3 times worse then Soros did.<br><br>Malaysian overall general plan of military complacency rests on several seriously flawed and malinformed points, namely:<br><br>1) We have more land and trees (as if SAF so dum to go hunting in the Jungle, instead we can take your cities and enjoy your facilities while you live out in the jungles with Orang Utans and rot out slowly from trench foot and other jungle-related attrition. Once they dare poke their head out of the jungle, it invites blistering superior firepower.)<br><br>2) We will prevail because we are right (Every country holds that attitude towards conflict, the Nazis did, the Americans did. But those who actually prevail are those who actually do something about that statement, not sit on it and blare out to the media "We will prevail! Dun underestimate us! We can give you bloody nose!" In the meantime, their armed forces remains the rabble they are, sorry the first rule of doing anything like this sucessfuly is NOT TO BELIEVE YOUR OWN HYPE. Despite the obvious superiority of the SAF, Singaporeans are always on to see if there are areas to improve, as evident here)<br><br>3) China and Russia will help us (Heh, sorry but that's pretty self deluded. China will not oppose every war the US might support, nor do Singapore put their eggs in the US basket. Russia? They have enough problems of their own to bother with a loudmouthed raving rabid obscure asian country asking them to die for them. China follows the lead.)<br><br>4) We have greater numbers (Uh yes, if you give rifles and a few clips to civilians and ask them to fight. Sorry lor, but ever heard of the term cannon fodder? There's a way to do conscription properly, and that's fortunately not what they are doing.)<br><br>5) Singapore has no space to dance (True, why do you think our operational plans are to kick your butt north with superior firepower and equipment against which all you have are rethoric?)<br><br>Nuff said, as you can see, it's obvious one side holds the life ammo, and with life ammo you dun anyhow shoot while the side with blanks can only hope to make themselves look threatening by shooting off their impotent firepower. But when the lead starts flying, we know jolly well what that matters.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Yeah, and RMN ships are invincible <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"> .Two RMN ships, one patrol boat, the KD SERAMPANG and the LST, the sri inderapura caught fire within days last year. The fire started in the kitchen of the LST while the crew were repairing breakfast. The  phanlax CIWS was damaged. The patrol boat caught fire while being given an  emergency repair. Ha! Indeed the MAF is invincible and nothing can happen to them. Screw their 'efficiency'. Screw their 'power'. Screw their 'might'.
