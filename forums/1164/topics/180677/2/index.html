So the talking of replacement is unrealistic, RSAF always can upgrade the E2C as well. Especially other countries in the Asean even donÂ’t have a taste of AWES as yet.</div>

Basically, the brains behind the E-2C. We introduced new and more powerful computers, developed the real-time command and control software and introduced high resolution colour monitors. We've also incorporated the satellite-based Global Positioning System or GPS for short."</a></strong><br><br>"Basically, it's a radar that allows the E-2C to provide automatic detection and tracking a target over water and over land up to 250 nautical miles away. In addition to the APS 138 Radar, what the E2 carries is the identification friend or foe system. Now this allows the weapon system officer on board the E-2C to identify the target meaning that he'll classify them as either friendly or unknown up to 250 miles away."</blockquote>3.<strong><a href="http://www.dsta.gov.sg/home/DisplayPage/ContentPage10.asp?id=2611" rel="nofollow"><blockquote><br>capable of providing air and surface surveillance, as well as tactical control of air assets....<br>within DSTA, we were able to design and develop the Command and Control (C2) system and its software (completely) locally.</blockquote></a></strong><br><br><strong><a href="http://www.geocities.com/CapeCanaveral/Hall/3098/" rel="nofollow">more info</a></strong><br><br>4.Prof Lui Pao Chuen, Chief Defence Scientist,<br>Naval Platform Technology Seminar 10th May 2001 tell you<br><br><strong><a href="http://www.mindef.gov.sg/nps/technical/paper1.html" rel="nofollow">what is LALEE</a></strong><br><blockquote>38. A UAV designed for a continuous coverage mission will require the operating cost per flying hour to be very low, below US$1,000, to be affordable. A continuous coverage station will require the flying of about 10,000 hours per year. The capital cost of acquiring the platform and payload, say at US$50m will be overtaken by the operations and maintenance cost after five years of operations. The US Navy is studying the MRE (Multi-Role Endurance) UAV to perform this mission. We have just completed a 3 year long study of LALEE which is an integrated airborne surveillance and communications system designed to provide continuous temporal coverage over a very large area. Providing a task group operating in the littorals with continuous surveillance from the air with this class of UAV will be considerably cheaper than operating current generation of surveillance and communications platforms. The technology is there but whether Navies will to want to invest in this class of UAV will depend on their perceived need for a continuous coverage platform.</blockquote></div>

Like what lionnoisy had said, the mission computers are upgraded. Our E-2C are not ordinary E-2C, shld be E-2C+ <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"> . But in terms of age wise, the almost 20 years frame can be the main trouble if there is not enough visual inspection.</div>
