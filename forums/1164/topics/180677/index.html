The talks are also examining disposal options for the aircraft.<br><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Singapore has already acquired at least six Gulfstream Vs as its preferred replacement platform and is expected to convert the bulk of these to carry the Israel Aircraft Industries Phalcon active phased array radar</strong></span>.<br>John Beaulieu, business development manager for the USNÂ’s PMA 231 programme office, said the Hawkeye talks began on 22 February.<br>Speaking at the show, he said: Â“We anticipate that they would want to keep their aircraft flying for at least the next five years; how do we go from here to there, since they do have group zero aircraft that are rapidly facing obsolescence issues.Â”<br>Beaulieu says the navy has approached the talks in Â“receiving mode, to see what exactly the nature of their plan is, if they have oneÂ”.<br>Separately, Beaulieu says that the USN is continuing to discuss a potential Indian navy requirement for six E-2C Hawkeye 2000 configuration aircraft, although those talks are now focusing on shore-based options. The talks also include an extended range E-2C configuration that incorporates a non-folding wing, allowing the fitting of additional internal tanks in the outboard wing section.<br>Tom Trudell, AEW business development manager with Northrop Grumman Integrated Systems, said that the plug would provide an additional three hours endurance if retrofitted into existing aircraft, adding that detailed design studies are underway.<br><br></div>

A G-550 CAEW&amp;C aircraft has been ordered by the Israel Air Force.<br>The aircraft utilizes technologies Elta successfully developed for other airborne early warning (AEW) aircraft. The business jet configuration provides a low-cost option while offering the full range of systems of larger AEW aircraft.<br><br>Elta's CAEW&amp;C systems include phased array radar, phased array IFF (Identification of Friend or Foe), Signal Intelligence (SIGINT) and a Communication system. The communication system includes also a data link and a Satellite Communication (SATCOM) system for secure high-speed links to ground stations.<br><br>A unique fusion technique cross-correlates data from all the CAEW&amp;C sensors allowing the aircraft to automatically search for specific targets. Data and reports can be integrated in a network centric system.<br><br><img src="http://www.iai.co.il/pict/Paris2005/G550CAEWM.jpg"><br></div>

There could be completely new ways of meeting the requirement.

This unmanned air vehicle is described by Prof Lui Pao Chuen, chief defence scientist at MINDEF as "an integrated airborne surveillance and communications system to provide continuous temporal and very large spatial coverage". This would "provide a task group operating in the littorals with continuous surveillance from the air [at a cost] considerably cheaper than operating current-generation surveillance and communications platforms".

I don't think defense budget is big enough to upgrade the E2C to Hawkeye 2000 standard and still buy the gilfstream with Phalco systems.<br><br>And then still must eventually look at F5 replacement, C130 upgrade or replacement, additional F15SGs?

These planes don't come cheap.<br><br>On top of that, you have to look at how you integrate the capability into your existing air defense systems and processes.<br><br>There are a few countries offering various AWACs type systems already.
