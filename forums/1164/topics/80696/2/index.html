I never made an assertion that the E2Cs were unescorted. My main interest in this scenario has always been this, can the RSAF negate the long range track and engagement parameters of the Su-30s such that the AWACs will not be taken out in a surprise engagement?<br><br>On a sidenote,as for EMPs, since we're talking about such exotic  technology, F-16s are very much more vulnerable since the computer "flies" it. Take out the computers, you take out the plane. (Unless  there's a new EMP hardened Block-XX F-16s I don't know about). Are the Su-30s exclusively fly-by-wire too?<br><br>And yes, I too thought (and still think) the Phoenix is the longest range AAM in operation right now. Unfortunately, the Phoenix is limited to the F-14 &amp; its radar systems. It's truly a remarkable weapon with extreme engagement envelopes. Truly far ahead of its time when it was first introduced. Any new systems which are comparable?<br><br></div></blockquote>the AIM-54 is too big and heavy that's why not many other planes carry it....infact the only other plane i've ever seen carry it is the F111 during trials.Anyway the time of the Aim54 is over...but it's range is still the longest......150km or there abouts</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I think the edge of RSAF would be in ECM. This sorta stuff not easily avalible off the shelf and usually have to develop locally.

            <div class='col-md body'>That sounds like what I believe too. RSAF would have an edge in ECM which hopefully will defeat any long-range AAMs. RMAF advantage with Su-30s would be long loiter time, mini-AWACS capability, and long range "reach out and touch someone" AAMs. Without good ECM on RSAF's part, I do believe the SU-30s have the DISTINCT advantage over any of our current fighters; even AWACS is not the all-powerful silver bullet. What use is an eye in the sky if your sheriff and deputies have a 6-round revolver when the other cowboys have Springfield rifles?<br><br>Have there been any studies done for Su-30s vs F-16s/F-18s/Rafale/Typhoon?<br><br>ECM itself is a black art of measure, countermeasure, counter-countermeasure. A small anecdote here; Lockheed Skunkwork's Ben Richards believed that the ECM package carried by the Taiwanese U-2s contributed to them being shot down by China's SA-2s. Instead of deflecting or spoofing the SA-2s, instead it seemed to attract the SA-2s like a beacon. One Taiwanese U-2 pilot seemed to survive because.....he forgot to switch his ECM on.<br><br>Not sure if we have bunker-busters.  Can shaped warheads with guidance via laser or GPS of our own design defeat these HAS? What about those hangars built underground? I remember reading an air force having those (Israeli?).<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by Langley:</div><div class="quote_body">I think the edge of RSAF would be in ECM.

The lack of agility in AMRAAM at longer ranges (forget to mention this previously) is due to its loss of kinetic energy after motor burnout along with small fin area. Meteor uses a ramjet engine with longer motor burn time to sustain energy levels over longer distances, I would suspect.<br><br><blockquote><strong><br>......and WTH are u doing awake so late man?!</strong></blockquote>Not working tomorrow man!

What about the rest ? on runway or in Air ?<br><br>You got to be kidding, 4 su30 + 4 escort ! you got to be the most outdated airforce general in the world in your tactics ! You just totally put a leash on your aircrafts and totally lost the element of surprise and send a invitation card for RSAF to let them know you are coming.<br><br>Yep the folks on hawkeye is so poor in their maths that they fail to count how many planes that is assembling in the air or on the ground ! You just give the game away by assembling such a large strike force to just go after the hawkeye. You also give RSAF to scramble the welcome party for you, while you are busy assemble everyone in the ground or air, 8 aircraft it will take forever to assemble ! What you should do is just 2 su30s, that all it need to take out the hawkeye and the escorts. Possible 2 su30s that will be 3/4 way to cover 1st flight of su30s retreat. Go after runway ? forget it, nowaday it take less than 3 hr to repair, just go for the planes ! But the problem is, 1/2 of singapore planes is oversea, so the most you can take out 1/3 with any luck. You still face someone with 2/3 of their planes, which is still a lot more than you in the end.</div>
