We happened to be in the same coy during BMT, BCT &amp; SLC. I have seen many guys/buddies who become SCs and "Ociffers", and started to turn sadists when they are re-appointed as appointment holders as Section commanders and PCs. But I never seen Pandiaraj part of this kind of nonsense game. He was highly regarded as a gentleman that would pushed the men to the limits thru complete understanding of their mission requirements. He is ONE of the new generation CDO commanders that would not use excessive abuses and "happy hours" to achieve their aims.<br><br>A man died. The involved faced the music, we shut the "gap" up. Period. Whatever things that have been written here is not going to make it any better.<br><br>Tweeker<br><br></div></blockquote>Pandiaraj was my SR Pl ex-PC, and my seniors had undying support of his character as their leader. Unlike the PC who took over him which basically is just like Mr Teo - ironclad a*s.</div>

Let me show you where the right words are:<br><blockquote>"<strong>According to the charges</strong>:<br><br>Pandiaraj, supervising officer of the Combat Survival Training Course and the Officer Commanding of the Commando Training Wing of the School of Commando, ordered the drill.<br><br>He told the instructors to hold the trainees' heads under water four times, for up to 20 seconds each time.<br><br>Ng and Divanandhari held the trainees' heads under water.

I think the preface of "According to the charges" makes that pretty clear.<br><br>Gee, I wonder if those presenting those charges are interested in painting the men as innocent, or guilty?<br><br>And if they're trying to present these as guilty men, would they be trying to make things look as bad as possible?  Ooh, perish the thought!<br><br>I'm assuming your caveat "if the charges are true" indicates that you are already aware that the tripe that you quoted is slanted against the men being charged.  Yet, your closing indicates that the prosecution's already got you sucked in, if you're willing to "screw the good characters" and ignore the context that truly shows how trumped-up these charges are.  Thank god we don't have a jury system here - it would turn out to be the lynch mob that you claim you don't want to start.<br><br>Moxie, like I said before, don't go getting caught up in the powers-that-be's spin.  Learn to read between the lines - that's how this town operates.</div>

If you think that the dunking practice originated from him, you're the one talking nonsense.<br><br>I raised the question of why this case was being heard in the civilian courts and not in the military courts - is that not a legitimate question, seeing how we have already reviewed the military provisions and found no good cause?  Now you allege that I have some mysterious and baseless personal agenda, and you call ME the conspiracy theorist?  Be brave and take your medication, will you?<br><br>"Wickedness of this atrocity"?  What are you now, the conscience fairy?  I haven't seen any indication about the intent to kill Sgt Hu, have you?  If not, what "wickedness" are you bleating about?  Methinks you've run out of logical ammunition, and you're just trying to jerk emotional strings here.  Oh boo hoo hoo, you poor fragile sensitive soul.<br><br>On top of that, we've heard here from men who have served with and under Pandiaraj, and speaking from their personal experience (which you lack), they have attested to his character.  From your piddly little ivory tower, you blithely write these men's life experiences off as inane martyrdom.  You can't get any more sickeningly low than that.  Then again, seeing the tripe you've come up with so far, maybe you can.<br><br>It's just as well you leave this topic.

He approved/ordered the drill, which can take many meanings. According to the charges,<br><br>"He told the instructors to hold the trainees' heads under water four times, for up to 20 seconds each time."<br><br>Is the dunking itself already a violation of TSR? If so, I don't see why Pandiaraj is not at fault and should not be charged.

            <div class='col-md body'>The four as charged were indeed wrong.<br><br>Wrong for not checking up on approved Â“tortureÂ” means when conducting the course.<br>Wrong for being negligence on the part of training safety.<br>Wrong for being over zealous in their attempt to being realistic about the treatment a POW can expect.<br><br>My question is, Â“Was there an intent to cause hurt or the intent to kill the trainee?Â”<br><br>As someone who had gone through the often tough and sometimes Â“sadisticÂ” training in Hendon, I doubt very much so.<br><br>Hypocrisy. Where is the hypocrisy in all that was said here?<br><br>After following the previous thread on this incident and this very thread, I have to come to the conclusion that the main hypocrisy all originate from people who are all too fast and eager to dish out a load to those from Hendon.<br><br>[B]Â“IMO, 4 years years for these jokers is quite a joke. Apply manslaughter charges and these champions are gone farks.Â”<br><br>Â“the blood on their hands will scream for justice when these 4 idiots die.Â“[/b]<br><br>And not surprisingly, these are the people who are often not from Hendon. They are screaming for Â“justiceÂ” to be served. Are they really interested in seeing justice served or are they gleefully awaiting for the fall of the commandos? The commandos who had claimed the best combat unit for several years. The commandos whose elite and special status had so much irked the displeasure, hatred, and jealousy of the Â“arm-chair commandosÂ” who had fantasized about their own Â“skillsÂ” countless times on the grounds of counterstrike and the likes of it.<br><br>I had served in the formation and I must admit that the culture in there is different from the rest of the services. If there is to be another charge to be added to the four, it should be that they are very wrong to assume that people from outside the formation when attending the courses in Hendon, are ready, fit and prepared in both physically and mentally. I am not saying that people outside the formation are unfit, but rather for us who have started our service in that environment, we are more aware and prepared in all ways to expect the kinds and types of training methods, official and non-official alike.<br><br>I had gone through the combat survival course where only the spraying of water was employed. And I can tell you that that was considered a joke to my company mates and me.<br><br><strong>Â“The trainers wanted to simulate a drowning experience to the trainee and killed him by "Accident." Question is, is it really that important for trainees to feel what it is like to drown in order to complete this course? Is that experience gonna be useful?<br><br>Heck, I can think of a hundred and one ways to torture a prisoner for information. Pulling out of fingernails/teeth with a plier, electrical shocks etc. Why not simulate these experiences too? I mean why just drowning? Come on, we don't want these elite warriors to miss out the full package do we? Better still, strip their pants and shove things up their ass, and simulate "Rape" too. For a full experience... Death simulation is quite cool too, why not that? Oh, already done. Sorry. Now that the death simulation is complete, can we bring the 2nd sgt back now?Â”</strong><br><br>Are we to conduct the combat survival course whereby the trainees are taught to expect humane and Â“spraying of waterÂ” treatment by the enemy?<br><br>The recent fiasco that the US Army had with their treatment of the Iraqi prisoners proved that even a supposedly developed and civilized country like America cannot prevent prisoner abuse, what hope do we have or can expect our servicemen to face when in the custody of the enemy?<br><br>Spraying water on the trainees is supposed to simulate what? That the enemy will do similar "humane treatment" to extract information during interrogation? If that is the kind of treatment that the enemy will employ, I will bet that many Â“peace-lovingÂ“ soldiers will gladly be taken prisoner so as to sit out the conflict in a safe and humane environment. But is that the truth? To those who seek the truth in this matter, is that the kind of training that you think should be employed? I can only say that I am only too glad that many true trainers within the formation do not see it that way.<br><br>What went wrong was a mistake and a mistake that caused a guardsman to lost his life. There was no intent of the four trainers to kill him or any other trainees. Nevertheless it will be a mistake that the four will have to pay.<br><br>Going soft on the combat survival course or having useless methods like spraying of water on the trainees will be more damaging to us in the long run.<br><br>Whether by choice or not, those who are posted to the commandos took the risks and dangers that comes together with being the elite. Like it or not, we are there to be trained to do a job and even the most ah-beng and boh-chap fellow in my company knew and understood that. We still do.<br><br>It will be a shame to see the accomplishment of the commandos going down the drain for not the reason of Justice but for the malice intent and agenda of some.<br><strong></strong><strong></strong><strong></strong><strong></strong></div>
