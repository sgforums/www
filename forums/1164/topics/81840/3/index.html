            <div class='col-md body'>I think there's a need to separate civilian &amp; military justice.<br><br>I cannot but praise what Singapore's doing with civilian justice: independent investigation, submission of full report to MINDEF, Parliament &amp; the victim's family, suspension of culpable soldiers &amp; now criminal persecution.<br><br>Notice how specific the formal charges are for three of the accused? (I'll wait for court day to see how the state attorney argues against the 4th guy for "failing to stop them".) That's how the legal system works; the A-G isn't interested in pursuing any breakdown in command, or incriminating the SAF or Commando culture, if they don't directly relate to a crime caused.<br><br>The latter review, &amp; follow-up reforms - even hierarchical accountability &amp;/or persecution - comes under military justice, which I believe is done by DMG (local version of the American JAG). They'll be responsible for, as indirect punishments, withholding promotions or stalling the careers of signed-on regulars, even conducting formal court martials.<br><br>I can't see how Cheah (as the Commando CO) could "escape" the latter indictment.* What I wondered earlier, however, was whether the civilian side would charge him as well &amp;, more importantly, confidently establish a convictable case. It's not as easy as it sounds - see Wiranto/East Timor or Ollie North/Iran-Contra - let alone trying to snare in any higher-up officers as well. Did anyone outside of the unit even have copies of the lesson plans/TSRs prior, for example?<br><br>* According to MINDEF's earlier news release - http://www.mindef.gov.sg/display.asp?number=1936 - they initially suspended 5 instructors ("4 officers &amp; a senior specialist") who conducted the training, &amp; relieved the CO as well as "2 other instructors who were responsible for supervising the training". I'll leave it to you to interpret who among the lot is now criminally charged, but I can't see how the others could hope to advance in their military careers without any detrimental fallout.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>IMO, 4 years years for these jokers is quite a joke.  Apply manslaughter charges and these champions are gone farks.<br><br>Who is at fault here? It cannot be the trainee, cos he was pretty much helpless to resist.  No one wants to repeat CST, so no one will wimp out halfway either.  So this puts the trainee in a very vulnerable position.<br><br>The trainers wanted to simulate a drowning experience to the trainee and killed him by "Accident."  Question is, is it really that important for trainees to feel what it is like to drown in order to complete this course?  Is that experience gonna be useful?<br><br>Heck, I can think of a  hundred and one ways to torture a prisoner for information.  Pulling out of fingernails/teeth with a plier, electrical shocks etc.  Why not simulate these experiences too?  I mean why just drowning?  Come on, we don't want these elite warriors to miss out the full package do we?  Better still, strip their pants and shove things up their ass, and simulate "Rape" too.  For a full experience...  Death simulation is quite cool too, why not that?  Oh, already done. Sorry.  Now that the death simulation is complete, can we bring the 2nd sgt back now?<br><br>Just where is the line drawn on such "training?"  What gives these instructors the right to play with the lives of their trainees so recklessly?  I don't give half a fark whether they have gone thru such nonsense themselves.  They have crossed the line, and they have killed a trainee.  They should also be charged in the civil court with manslaughter.<br><br>As for the balakrishnan, he should bear twice the charge.  Simple, he was aware of such practices, perhaps having been the one who practiced them.  See things in black and white for a moment. Its either he approves of it, or disapproves of it.  There is no neutrality.  If he disapproved of such "training," he should have put a stop to it.  By the fact that he idly did nothing, he approves of such "training."  The charges, "Failure to stop a violation of TSR.  Encouraging a violation TSR, GROSS negligence, and manslaughter."<br><br>I ever had the opportunity to come across a footage of a Russian elite paratrooper unit's hazing ceremony.  The instructors would drop kick recruit in the head at any moment.  All their kicks are potentially deadly, and the footage caused much uproar in Russia as well as the US, which featured it on one of their world's most violent somthing tv series.<br><br>This act of dunking trainees to the point of drowning is NOT a small matter.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Moxie and Shotgun, to some extent I agree with what you are saying, but there is one issue that still remains unresolved:<br><br>A soldier was killed by two (or, as the court would have it, four) soldiers, through a violation of military regulations.  The civil court therefore has no jurisdiction over this matter.<br><br>Why is the case being conducted in a civil court instead of being in front of a military tribunal?  The only reason I can see for this is that it is not in fact any genuine attempt at achieving justice, but is instead a cynical publicity exercise to achieve Teo Chee Hean's political ends.<br><br>Moxie, Wiranto and North are inappropriate comparisons.  Wiranto was tried as a war criminal (subject to violations of international, not military, law), and North was tried for obstructing an act of Congress, which falls into the jurisdiction of Congress (hence the Select Committee investigations).</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Not being a lawyer, I'll gladly defer to anyone who's better qualified to comment on this.<br><br>That said, I believe the civilian system supersedes the military system in the Singapore administration of juctice (SAF Act; Chap. 295; Part 1; 6.). &amp;, with timely appointment of independent investigations of serious SAF incidents, it generally applies outside of the judiciary as well.<br><br>IMHO It's only logical, now that alleged felonies have been committed, that the most appriopriate resource to address them must be the civilian authorities. The perversity here isn't just down to rogue acts per se - which could've been dealt with internally - but has been deadly, even homicidal.<br><br>Here's an online list of chargeable military offenses locally (same SAF Act, as source):<br><br>http://statutes.agc.gov.sg/non_version/cgi-bin/cgi_gettoc.pl?&amp;actno=2000-REVED-295&amp;date=latest&amp;method=part<br><br>Makes for a sobering read but, while I can foresee indicting the trainers &amp; company for various misdeeds, IMHO there won't be any formal justice served for Hu Enhuai - not directly. Really, it's beyond the military provisions. You can use the latter pretext to put on trial, say, the CO &amp; the other 3 Commandos who were also suspended (as well as anyone else culpable), but the foremost perpetrators must be dealt with by the State &amp; not the SAF.<br><br>Temujin - of course it has to be the police; that's what they're there for! It can't be the Coronor's Court since the nature of death has been already established. Who else then: the Family Court, the Juvenile Court, the Small Claims Tribunal? <br><br>Gedanken - you've being a tad libelous in your last post *hint* but otherwise to clarify, I brought up Wiranto &amp; Ollie North only to show how murky it is to seek redress for military transgressions outside of the military sphere. Noel Cheah can't escape responsibility for what happened at CST, but it's another thing to trial him in a court of law altogether. For better or worse, State prosecutors won't formally haul up anyone unless they're mighty confident of putting him away.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Moxie, IÂ’m not a lawyer either, but the wording in the page you posted seems to be pretty clear cut.<br><br>First, it says, Â“Nothing in this Act shall affect the jurisdiction of civil courts to try a person subject to military law for any civil offenceÂ”.<br><br>Well and good.  Looking at the list of offences, this case can pretty much be covered under sections 25 to 28, plus section 41.  Also, if what Heng@ said is true, they can also be charged under section 33.  The total penalites for these offences come up to a lot more than the four years what the civil court is able to mete out.<br><br>Therefore, there seems to be no coverage by civil law that military law does not already attend to.<br><br>You call it libel, I call it an opinion! <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green">  So far, thereÂ’s been nothing to convince me that the intent behind the way this case is being handled is anything other than what IÂ’ve described.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I concur with only Provision 28 &amp; 41 as applicable for the Hu Enhuai case. Could be wrong on this, but I don't think the SAF ever superseding the civilian court in a criminally-caused death either (too young to remember the pre-1980s). The Tekong recruit who broke down &amp; shot his PC in the last decade - can anyone recall his trial?<br><br>IMHO The other military Provisions are more applicable for the near-drowning(s) - inc. victims unnamed in the present charges - &amp; for the rogue behavior per se. I don't think they'll "stick" with the Hu Enhuai incident; these proposed charges are simply not direct enough as far as serving justice for him goes.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>1st ting first... what Mr Teo said to cover up everyone's a*s really made me lose confidence in him, and that it's all publicity to show everyone things will be a-ok again... by what? spraying water as interrogation simulation?<br><br>I know (though not personally) most of those named in the incident, and those who know them long enuf knows they're not bad characters (not that they're bad at all).... one simply have to look at how ranger courses was ran to know why... there are some much worse. It's simply that some trainings that are to be carried out with caution (unmentioned in training guidelines), had become so common as to be thought normal, and some practices (as Heng pointed out) were undoubtly wrong, but were also thought common enough to be thought okay. That's when things can go very wrong, as happened in Sgt Hu's death. And the named will go down with it. Noel Cheah had led the way ahead for them. They'll not be self-respecting commandos if they don't admit they're wrong and are sorry. And those of whom i know are men of honour. Sh*t happens, and they should willingly - and with remorse - go down for wrongly causing another's death.<br><br>Where do we go from now for the Cdos?</div>
