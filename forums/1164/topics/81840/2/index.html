In and of itself, the specific instruction to hold the trainee's head under water was not necessarily fatal - after all, how many combat-fit individuals can't hold their breath for 20 seconds?<br><br>So the dunking wasn't part of the original lesson plan.  SOMEBODY approved it at some point, and having in the post for a short period of time, it is likely that someone besides Pandiaraj approved it.  Where's that individual in this affair?<br><br>I wouldn't go putting too much faith in the news reports right now - they're not telling the whole truth.  Where's the safety officer in this trial?  He was not even present at the scene of the incident!  Why isn't he being charged for not stopping things by virtue of his neglect?  If he, of all people, is not on trial here, it raises serious questions about how this matter is being handled.<br><br>The safety officer isn't on trial, but two other men, who are at best only equally involved in the case, are.  Something tells me that they've been railroaded.</div>

I'm saying that if you're going to charge Pandiaraj and Bala, you may as well take it all the way and charge Teo Chee Hean too.

Well and good - if he is sincere, why does the public not know the following:<br><br>- why was the safety officer, given his central role in this case, not included in this case?<br>- why are these particular two men, who did not physically participate in the dunkings, being charged when others, who could well be involved to that same degree, are not?<br>- what does Mindef hope to gain from allowing four men, instead of two, to be prosecuted?<br><br>Is it because the inclusion in the charges of Pandiaraj and Bala is based on such flimsy excuses as to be an embarrassment to Mindef?  Are they trying just to get the public off their backs through a the-more-charged-the-merrier approach, but not going so far as to harm anyone of any consequence to them?<br><br>Teo's got no business talking about transparency.  Given how they're trying to pull a three-card trick on the public, all this talk about transparency is a mouthful.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Yeah, been kinda busy, Viper.  The Straits Times article just got me going, so I thought it was time to post.<br><br>Anyway, this whole case is such a sham.  What penalty can a civil court pass that is worse than anything that can be passed in a military tribunal?  The only reason I can see for this civil court case is publicity - it's just another empty gesture by the powers-that-be.</div>
