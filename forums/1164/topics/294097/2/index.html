            <div class='col-md body'>Well, all depends on the path and type of the bullet.  I figure that with a rococheting 7.62 AP round coming in under the chin and exiting the frontal bone, there's a small chance the fellow could survive, and depending on the dinner parties you attend, might even be quite amusing.

            <div class='col-md body'>Apparently one kwailan officer or WO got shot in the head during the mid 80's.<br><br>The story goes one NSF shot him in the head at point blank range with an M16. The shooter surrendered after that and did not attempt to run.<br><br>My friend was an MP regular and he said he was at the scene.<br><br>Small hole in front but back of head wide open. Brains all over the office.<br><br>...<br><br>If you look at some Chinese website, you can see pics of people - including women - executed by shooting.<br><br>There seems to be 2 styles of shooting:<br>a) distance of several metres shooting at the front of prisoner<br>b) point blank, but I can't remember if these are front or back of prisoner's head<br><br>(Shooting from the back of head would be the worst as your face would be blown away. So I don't know what is the SOP.)<br><br>In both styles, the weapon was a 7.62 x 39 (AK47) calibre weapon. Never seen pistols, which I'm sure they have used but found ineffective.<br><br>Prisoners condemned are usually executed soon unlike in western countries.<br><br>Prisoners are bound with rope and paraded with a wooden plague stating crime like in the old days. For some reasons, the condemed don't wear prison uniforms but their own clothes. Prison probably don't want to do the laundry or waste the uniform.<br><br>Execution ground is usually open grass area with sand barriers to catch bullets. Prisoner is made to kneel down, blindfolded and shot by a single bullet, which the family of the condemned is required to pay for.<br><br>The results with the 7.62 x 39 is bloody and gory as you can imagine. In nearly every case the head has a very big hole. The worst one I saw was the bullet completely shattered the structure of a woman's skull so her head was like a deflated ball - flat, like a rubber mask with hair thrown on the ground.</div>

It is a little thing that sticks out of the patient's head which is attached to a monitor to check for raised intracranial pressure.<br><br>If it is a direct hit to the brain stem, instantaneous death. If it is a hit which affects the side of the brain but missed the thalamus, brainstem - patient may survive. People can still survive with half a brain.

The length of the barrel creates reduced muzzle velocity, which in turn reduces yawing and fragmentation of the bullet as it passes through the body (which is what causes the huge exit wound).  Fired over 100 metres from the target, the bullet lacks the velocity for fragementation, and M855 rounds don't help things either.</div>

I don't think pressure bandages will help with internal haemorrhaging within the skull.
