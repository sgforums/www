Like they all say - it is damn rare to get the textbook case in real life.<br>The common key rule : stabilize, blood results (especially clotting factors) and scan ,  then surgery. I remember sometimes neurosurgeons can get more creative with interesting cases. I know there was one case they did an exploration quickly , evacuate the bleeding (there are techniques that do not require GA - general anaesthesia now) , stabilise , did CT scan, second round of more aggressive decompression under GA aka they really open up everything and target the areas.<br><br>If the CT scan shows more bleeds, surgical decompression is done depending on the viability of the patient survival potential.<br><br>Sometimes if survival is deem so poor after assessment - they won't do anything but conservative management.

Yes it may be not as commonly required for gunshot wounds to the head. The reason why they insert an EVD is to monitor for intracranial hypertension in a penetrating trauma. If it is half the brain blown out , I doubt that they can insert an EVD in any way- they won't because first of all -  an enclosed skull adds the pressure - if one part of the skull bone gets blown out ....well no pressure- just a risk of something more interesting . 2nd of all, survival rate is as good as miraculous.<br><br>EVD may be used more frequently if they cannot remove the bullet fragments due to its lodging on the vital sites.<br><br>To be clear on what I said , for the GCS scores - hence they are in brackets as "main qualifiers" together with the severity and type of the wound for EVD insertions, not ICP measurement.<br><br>Sometimes they just don't remove the bullet or its fragments  if removing it will have a higher risk of death. So not every victim who survives a gunshot wound to the head will end up with the removal of the bullet from their brain.<br><br>The ED will always send people still alive with penetrating (note: penetrating as in bullet entry) gunshot wounds to the head straight to HDU or ICU regardless of their GCS state. More so ICU than HDU.  Never the general ward unless you are talking about a very very superficial non penetrating bullet graze to the head (just epidermal involvement) and nothing else.</div>
