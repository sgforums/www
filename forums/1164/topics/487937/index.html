              BMT</span></strong><br> This 9-week programme trains combat-fit recruits in the basic
              military skills to prepare them for advanced vocational training.
              The programme includes weapon training with the SAR 21 rifle which
              will teach recruits technical handling and marksmanship skills; a
              Battle Inoculation Course that simulates a real battlefield; a
              Field Camp which develops basic survival skills; progressive
              training to complete a 24-km route march which builds combat
              fitness and endurance; and hand grenade training.<br> <em><span style="font: inherit;">For those who fail to achieve the
              NAPFA test silver award, they are required to undergo an 8-week
              Physical Training Phase (PTP) prior to the PES A/B1
              BMT.</span></em><br>  <br> <strong><span style="font: inherit;">PES BP
              BMT</span></strong><br> As evidence has shown that obese recruits are able to achieve
              optimum fitness levels and weight loss in about 19 weeks, the new
              BMT programme for recruits with Body Mass Index (BMI) scores
              exceeding 27.0 will be 19 weeks. This BMT programme is designed to
              help obese recruits improve their physical fitness progressively
              while equipping them with basic soldiering skills and
              knowledge.</p>
              <p style="color: #333333; font-size: 14px; line-height: 16px;"><br> <strong><span style="font: inherit;">PES B2
              BMT</span></strong><br> Enlistees who were PES C1 previously underwent a 7-week BMT
              programme. The new 9-week PES B2 BMT programme will be conducted
              for recruits who are medically fit for deployment in selected
              combat and combat support vocations, such as signal operators,
              combat medics and naval system operators. These recruits will be
              given a new medical classification of PES B2, in place of the
              existing PES C1 classification. This is to ensure that the medical
              classification of our soldiers is consistent with their deployment.
              The new 9-week programme will include customised physical training,
              as well as basic combat training to prepare them for their combat
              and combat support roles.<br>  <br> <strong><span style="font: inherit;">PES C
              BMT</span></strong><br> The 9-week BMT programme will be conducted for PES C recruits. This
              programme will include light physical training and vocational
              training to prepare them for combat service support vocations, such
              as service medic, and those related to logistics and
              administration.<br>  <br> <strong><span style="font: inherit;">PES E
              BMT</span></strong><br> The 4-week BMT programme will be conducted for PES E recruits. This
              programme will focus on, vocational training as well as National
              Education, SAF core values, regimentation and discipline to prepare
              recruits for combat service support vocations.</p>
