            <div class='col-md body'>My 2 cents - it'll be good to "learn (to use)" enemy's weapons. In BMT (my time 17 yrs ago) they only told us how AK-47 sounds, but never hear or see one, much less use one. But the question is which arms to train on - so many out there, cost $$.<br>What situation would I need it?

            <div class='col-md body'>Anyway, I definitely think we should have familiarisation with all SAF infantry weapons, including live firing, for all combat troops. All we ever get are these training shed courses where they give you dummy rounds and you learn to load and unload, load and relaod...<br><br>Anyone who think this is enough obviously haven't tried shooting a weapon you're not familiar with.<br><br>My first M203 round from a borrowed weapon landed about 30m short of target. This show how inadequate all the training shed lessons were. Of course we were shooting at the extreme range of 250 to 300m.<br><br>There will always be people who will say this is not necessary etc and they will bring out the "irrefutable" question of money as if we are talking about their money.<br><br>They prefer to spend every ICT &amp; BCT redoing the same old same old FIBUA, FOFO, bayonet assault course, trench digging etc... as this monotonous repetition somehow saves money instead of teaching troops something new and very important.<br><br>Not to mention refreshing.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>You can't sub out time at the range for training shed lessons, no two ways about it. Despite all the theory and stuff, if the grunt has not shot his weapon enough for real he can't really become a good shooter.<br><br>In which case I think our time at the range actually sending steel downrange is not quite enough. The few BPT shoots in BMT are certainly not enough, and after which the unit shoots only come once in a while. Compared to the time the US Marines spend at the range, we must be doing the bare minimum.<br><br>I mean how many HEDPs have we actually sent downrange in our whole NS life? (Only two on my part) I doubt it's quite enough.<br><br>In any case a good shooter will be able to quickly pick up different firearms, but a bad shot will still be a bad shot no matter how many weapons you have been introduced to at the Training Shed.<br><br>Anyway, ST= SingaporeTyrannosaur, TS= Topic Starter/Thread Starter</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Another point to note is that our BMT syllabus is already very condensed.  We hardly have time to complete our BTP, where got time to throw in foreign weapons training?  Perhaps only certain units might conduct some.  But really I believe that if we do ever have such a thing, it would only be during a real shooting war.<br><br>Picking up enemy weapons isn't exactly a good idea under normal circumstances too.  Who knows what kinda booby traps await... remember GI Jane? LOL!</div>
