            <div class='col-md body'>And of course in FIBUA a sidearm can be extremely useful, especially when you are shooting at your enemy point blank, there are still some alive, and you go "black" (run out of ammo or IA), at that point there is no chance to reload or retreat and it's either unarmed combat or to draw out your sidearm and plug that guy.<br><br>Having to choose between unarmed combat or sidearm, I don't mind the insurance of the sidearm (though of course the sidearm could be wrestled from you and turned against you if you're not careful, but hey either way it ends the fight).<br><br>It just might save the life of you and your buddy. I mean unlike other forms of fighting, FIBUA involves a lot of brutal, close in action and it's good to have more then one weapon at hand.<br><br></div>

Everybody will be totting one.<br><br>In that case, even if the sniper sees you got a sidearm, he can't be sure you are an LT until he confirms other things, removing the risk of carrying sidearms making you more prone to sniper fire.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>In any case, a properly trained sniper will not just plink anybody who has a sidearm. A well trained sniper would know his enemy's SOP, as well as observing the target to be more sure of what he is actually shooting has command value.<br><br>I don't exactly think their mentality is "shoot whoever's got a sidearm".<br><br>They'll probably try to observe the actions of the individuals... is he just one of the grunts? Is he giving orders? Holding maps? Appearing to be leading?<br><br>So carrying sidearm makes you more prone to sniper fire? If the sidearm becomes standard issue, I think no.<br><br></div>
