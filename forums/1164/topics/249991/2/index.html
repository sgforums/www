I think that was popularised in the movie, "We Were Soldiers," where Col Moore insisted his men learn the jobs of the people above them and below them.

Bundled with the cheap and readily avaliable ammo, its a great gun for the untrained and poor afgahn fighters.<br><br>AK RUSH!!!<br><br>just my 2c.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>my bad... i think the real reason why you can stack AK47 to the moon is that its easy to built and its durability. Meaning if it was given to a 6 year old kid he can shoot it right away and dont bother to teach him on weapon cleaning etc. But if you give M16 to a six year old kid you have to teach him how to clean the rifle, or else it will jammed, so Ak47 is much easier to use.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>How come we are talking about child-soldiers.<br><br>Not untrue, but at the end of the day you still need to learn how to clean and strip the AK or else it will eventually foul up on you. There is no such thing as no-need-to-clean weapon.<br><br>I mean despite the reputation of the AK being able to shoot after being in mud for months, no real grunt, child or not in his right mind will attempt such a thing unless he really had to.<br><br>So the kid will still need to strip and clean the AK at the end of the day (and hence you have to teach him), I'm not sure how this is different from the M-16, except that you don't need to do it that frequently.<br><br>I think the reason why we see so many child soldiers using AK is because the AK is simply far more common, not because the Somalis (or what other country that have kids running around with guns) sat down and had some procurement contest evaluating which rifle was the best for kids to use.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br><br></div>
