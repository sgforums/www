            <div class='col-md body'>well i think i can answer you the best since i have been thru this phase of pilot training but din make it thru airgrading so i could onli stop after airgrading.<br><br>There are 3 scenarios that can happen.<br>First scenario, if you qualify for OCS after BMT, you would be posted to OCS to complete your Tri-Service Term. After which you would be posted to Air Force School to wait for your turn to fly to Tamworth which is an hour's domestic flight from Sydney to do your airgrading.<br><br>Second scenario, you did not qualify for OCS but you manage to finish in the top few percentile in your cohort during BMT. You would get posted to Air Force School immediately after BMT. During your posting order, you would come under the category of RSAF regular. After which you would then wait for your turn to go to Tamworth for airgrading.<br><br>Third scenario, you made an application for pilot training, but becoz of pending medical status after the health screening, your status as pilot trainee is not confirmed, hence you would complete whatever posting you had after BMT, following which if your medical has been approved of, you will then be taken out and sent to Air Force School for your turn at airgrading.<br><br>There are other scenarios but these are the top common three. hope it did help you!</div>

Chopper pilots stay in Singapore to train.<br><br>3. WSO (fighter) would require you to go to the USA for a year for training. other than that, other WSO vocations would remain in Singapore.<br><br>hope that answer your queries</div>

After which he will show you the effects of control; i.e how the plane would reacted to the control of the pilot. after which brace yourself for some black knight manouevres as this is done to see if you are prone to get air sick.<br><br>Sortie 2 - the instructors takes off for you and you move off to training area for training and impart further knowledge of the gyroscope, the altimeter, the speedometer and etc. then slowly he would ask you to do the checks slowly one by one. Turning the plane and etc.<br><br>Sortie 3 to 5 - basically is the same as sortie 2 just tat you would start to take off by yourself and do the checks required yourself without any prompting from the instructors.<br><br>Sortie 6 - A pre test sortie. basically is sortie to practice all the stuff you have to do for your test.<br><br>Sortie 7 - Test 1<br><br>Sortie 8 to 15 - Dunno liao coz din make it thru test 1. lolx. but gotta do with aerobatics and high angle turning and such.<br><br>hope this helped</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>if you have no real interest in flying and just wish to try your luck and see if you can make it as a rsaf pilot. its going to be difficult. all those that earn their wings had a deep love for flying.<br>its a long process and if you think u pass out with your wings, you are guranteed a pilot job. u are wrong, i've come across a guy who passed out as a pilot and got his wings taken off becos the co of the operational squadron feel that he is not good enough. so this poor guy got stuck with a fresh 10 year contract with rsaf and lost his wings. ended up as a S1 before going to univ for studies. not sure where he is now.<br>rsaf is strict with its pilots. after passing out, u are cat d. in 2 years u must reach cat b or you lose your wings too.<br>basically everyone can learn to fly, but to reach the level that rsaf requires from its pilot is only a few who can attain it. u must not only be good in your flying skills. i've seen students being chopped becos they are weak in ground school.<br><br></div>
