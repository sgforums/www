            <div class='col-md body'><strong>Hi all, I'm curious as to what the typical Singaporean thinks of an Indonesia that is "managed" by Wiranto.<br><br>My curioisity stems from the fact that some of the wargamed scenarios I've dealt with here include a scenario where a martial law managed Indonesia revives Konfrontassi.<br><br>Do Singaporeans factor in a rogue Indonesia? </strong><br><br>We always had a good relationship with the Indonesian Armed Forces since Suharto time, especially with Wiranto ( We can't say the same with their politicians ). We have cultivated good relationship with Indonesian Generals ( Wine, dine and god knows what else ) all this years. If the Golkar party helm by Wiranto wins, at least he will bring some stability to Indonesia ( Martial Law maybe) and SG will have a fren running Indonesia who we can utilise and get favors in return. Its better to have an ally down south ( dont wanna meet any kompassus ) when things hots up in north.<br><br>Indonesia with its multitude of problems would not be able to conduct a exercise similar to Konfrontassi which anyway was not a successful operation in the 60's. And if it's revived again, it will definitely be a different story coz of all the new weapons and technology available today.<br><br>In a wargame scenario, we have factored-in fighting a war with a Indonesia. And In all the simulated exercises guess who wins all the time.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Thats utterly insane..To use nuclear weapons against fellow Chinese.Such is the evil nature of politics..Red China is trying to use nationalism as an excuse to finally get back at Taiwan.Any logical conclusion as to why, we'll never really know.I don't really think the minds of the greying military chiefs are working in a calm and sensible state.I'd say, you can't really trust a half-senile fella with the keys to absolute power and force.God bless us if one of the generals had been China's Head of State during the USAF EP-3 crisis on Hainan Island <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_twisted.gif" alt="Twisted Evil" title="Twisted Evil"></div>

Come to think of it, ballistic missiles are of no tactical usage unless they are armed with non-conventional munitions. If they are looking to level taiwanese cities (which i doubt they are prepared to do) why not with massive artillery or cruise missiles? Doubt PLA chiefs are irrational enough to use nukes no matter how small their yield, runs the danger of escalating a limited war to an all out one. The 500 ++ ballistic missiles are more of a show of force, symbolic.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Dun think China would be using any missiles against Taiwan. One reason is bacause of morale values of traditional chinese another reason is the missiles is meant to be used against potential "aggressors" with as many or more nukes than them. They just want Taiwan back with them...not destroy them. Well, tt what i think coz they are all chinese after all. As for the Singapore will fall under a nuke thing... wad i'm more concerned is will these ppl who said these fight alongside with us... or dig a trench and hide in. Whatever childish comments they give doesn't mena anything. Its weather they will fight for the man next to them. Right? As long as they fight well, i dun give a damn to what they say.</div>

We have cultivated good relationship with Indonesian Generals ( Wine, dine and god knows what else ) all this years. If the Golkar party helm by Wiranto wins, at least he will bring some stability to Indonesia ( Martial Law maybe) and SG will have a fren running Indonesia who we can utilise and get favors in return. Its better to have an ally down south ( dont wanna meet any kompassus ) when things hots up in north.<br><br>Indonesia with its multitude of problems would not be able to conduct a exercise similar to Konfrontassi which anyway was not a successful operation in the 60's. And if it's revived again, it will definitely be a different story coz of all the new weapons and technology available today.<br><br>In a wargame scenario, we have factored-in fighting a war with a Indonesia. And In all the simulated exercises guess who wins all the time.<br><br>[/b]</blockquote>Military-wise, Indonesia does not have sufficient amphibious capability to mount a Normandy on Singapore. Our Navy and Air Force will sink those few ships that can make their way to Singapore and those who manage to embark will be picked off by the Army. Of course, Indonesia knows this as well and wouldn't try this. Guess what S'pore military planners are really scared of are the airborne units of both Indonesia and Malaysia. Remember Malindo Darsasa in 1991? Guess that's our nightmare scenairo: A scene right out of WWII with paratroopers dotting the skies over Singapore. Indeed, the strength of our neigbours is in special forces, with Indonesia's Kompassus, and Wiranto's ex unit I think, regarded as the best in SEA. And our neighbours have divisions of them. Scary...<br><br>Political-wise, do not ever underestimate Indonesia. A strong Indonesia may seek regional hegemony e.g. Confrontation but a weak Indonesia is equally scary. Just look at the JI problem. Political-wise, our planners fear that in a weak Indonesia, a radical Islamist regime might take power and massive communal riots like those of 1965 following the failed PKI coup might erupt, spilling over into S'pore and M'sia and destabilising the region (See Huxley) However, the TNI has traditionally regarded itself as a guardian of the state and would not allow this to happen. Hence, while we may fear the Indonesian military, it also plays a very vital role in maintaing SEA security.<br><br></div>
