Maybe helicopters ? not likely. Too expensive and can see nothing and do nothing.<br><br>First, there is too many fishing boats and ships around the area. Even with the best binocular or night vision, you cannot tell who the bad guy, they don't hang out the jolly pirate flags ! They are like any other boats, they don't brandish that gun openly till mission time. You just assume that fly around and you see a boat with a pirate flag or men all armed ?<br><br>Once they identified the target, they go for it. They will move close then armed themselves and board. And it is the middle of the night. They will move so fast that the ship will not have time or even dare to send any signal. You cannot just shoot up any small boat that seem to come along side a ship, can be a habour master boat bring to and fro the channel pilot.<br><br>By the time even you get signal which is after the incident, even if you see a boat, are you sure it is the one, you cannot shoot even warning shot as you cannot be 100% sure !<br><br>Even if 100 % sure, they may have dump their weapons, and loots also  within a few mintues, they are already out of internation water, back in their own countries water. You want to engage "local fishermen" ?<br>Even if you get the pirate in the open, you fire at them from air ! You will end up killing everyone, losting all the evidences and been accuse of bloody murder of poor fishermen, start a reginal war ? yep sure look good !!! SAF C-130 or Super Puma - kill a boat full of local fishermen out fishing.<br><br>Next Pirates avoid cruise ship or a ship full of  bikini girls as they spell too much trouble. They are not that dumb. They know to hit a crusie ship and you will bring up the heat so hot and so much pressure, that that will end that business real fast.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>America can impose on all vessels heading for USA to have the cargo checked and cleared of any possible WMD before allowed to go near their ports. Singapore cannot. Any vessels sailing into port of singapore, if suspected of carrying any WMD will be asked to anchor way outside the port area, failing which these vessels will be sunk, with whatever means.<br>Anybody with the intention to carry terrorist attacks are terrorists, not pirates, and terrorists do not limit themselves to using sampan or motorboats only.<br>It is obvious that RSN is not focusing only on pirates on sampan, because their brains are not as small as sampan, fortunately. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br></div>
