The US Rangers are Special Forces or at least elite infantry.<br><br>Our NS boys and Nsmen are human. A GPMG is not a easy thing to carry around. I think having one organic to the platoon is enough. I can't imagine each section with one GPMG.<br><br>Alternatively, maybe expand the GPMG section to 5-men/2-guns. one commander and 2x gunners and 2x asst gunners. So we will have 2 GPMG per platoon.<br><br>So GPMG section will either deploy indepedently with 2 guns as a support role or maybe split to two. one gun will deploy as a support role. the second gun, will deploy and join up with one of the section.

I dun even have a full PL of man during my last few years of services. in the 80s SAF PL have more than what is needed but not today.<br><br>3. size dun matter in SAF. it is said that we had the most fire power in a section in the world that any army can ask for.<br><br>4. what about logistics, with the number now we have our log are having a big head when we are just on ex, if ops i really think will they make it in time?<br><br>and SAF is going or are in 3G now. most likely we will see a 3 man section soon.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>SAF reason then for reducing from 9 men section to 7 men section was due to increase firepower that 7 men sect provide due to introduction of SAW , LAW &amp; M203.<br><br>But in reality , I think they were following the US model, likewise, the US sect has increase in firepower as well.<br><br>But I think the main reason for reduce the US's Sect to 7 men was the introduction of Bradley IFV M2 (3+ 7 dismounted infantrys)which replaced the M113( 2+ 11 infantrys).<br><br>One thing , the newer  Bradley IFV M2A2/A3 has even smaller crew (3+6 dismounted infantrys).<br><br>AFAIK, only 6 men sect will be the dismounted from the M2A2/A3, now will SAF follow the US again &amp; down to 6 men?<br><br>BTW, Bionix has a crew of 3 + 7 dismounted infantry.<br><br>Going back to 9 men sect for SAF I think is quite impractical, likewise for GPMG in a sect, then SAW and GPMG will hace duplicated role.</div>

Why GPMG is harder hitting then a saw, it give the section a lot more firepower which the saw cannot.</div>
