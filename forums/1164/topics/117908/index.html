I have never been seen an M113 or a Bionix in real life, much less been in one.<br><br>But I think that demographic factors were a major component in the decision to trim down the size of the infantry section. I remember reading a Straits Times article on manpower management in the SAF with regards to the shrinking population. Not only were the infantry sections trimmed, they farmed out services like catering and some forms of transport to the private sector.<br><br>That said, having extra men around in the section wouldn't hurt too much. While the sect comd may have some extra headaches controlling a couple more men, I'm sure with some practice he'll appreciate having the extra muscle.</div>

You have 3 small fire teams for the commander to deploy as he wish and provide back up.<br><br>In WW2, some American infantry sections were 11 to 13 strong, and they were already partly mobile/ mechanised.<br><br>Most times, because of various factors, sickness, injury... other duties.... the 9 men section of the past was sometimes 8 soldiers.   During my reservist, when 7 men section was implemented.... on one or 2 occasions some sections had to merge for training because of lack of soldiers... became a section plus for training !  In real ops, I would expect this to happen, as a result of injury, KIA, attachment to other companies etc etc . The resultant section may end up too small to be effective for fighting, except for recce patrol.</div>
