Anyway, the SIB-investigated story had the dead guy supposedly hiding a stray M203 round following SAFTI live-firing, then taking the full force of the blast &amp; thus "saving" the others. If that's not the real truth, then it's a secret between those in the vehicle.<br><br>A runaway M113 - driven by a non-licensed concript - from another battery also destroyed the garage cages during my active stint.<br><br>During the subsequent mono-intake, a fellow DI of mine (from the same platoon/battery) got hit by sharpnel from a wayward grenade throw, but luckily escaped with stomach wounds.<br><br>Actually, my unit had a bit of an jinx reputation then. There were also other infamous incidents -  from losing a bulky LP3 laser-range finder during standby (with barb wire! &amp; sentry guards!), to a hugely-unpopular "scholar" BC getting his car scratched, to a dramatic face-off on ORD day itself, when a mortarman challenging another unpopular officer to a fight outside the camp gates!<br><br>My own Tekong BMT stint was incident-free, except for my recently discovering that it took place around the Hotel New World collapse. When on-course at SOAY, 2 major incidents dominated. The 1st was another soldier supposedly getting his nuts crushed by some heavy equipment during the Arty NCO course, which left the whole camp in poor morale when I was there. The 2nd occurred during our own CPX exercise along the then-ulu Loyang Avenue, when a civilian car inexplicably rammmed into a turning 3-tonner's fuel tank &amp; causing a fire that destroyed both vehicles (many an unaccounted-for equipment ended up being "blamed" to have been thus lost, instead of us signing 1206's.)<br><br>Reservist was relatively fortunate too, beside some minor accidents &amp; a short spell when we coincidentally lost a few guys to cancer. Seems like the wayward 25-pounder episode isn't that rare; I also saw a similar thing happening during one of the end-of-parade rehearsals during the early '90s, when the driver fail to negotiate a bend properly &amp; the trailing gun swiped into another car.</div>
