            <div class='col-md body'>Just repeating what I wrote in any thread.<br><br>1. In the School of Artillery, the OCS batch before my ANCO course, an officer cadet stood between an M71 hooked on a MAN 7t truck.   When the truck moved off, the gun ran over the cadet killing him.<br><br>2. During my ANCO course, an officer cadet in the course running concurrently had four fingers chopped off by a monkey ram.   He was holding on to an iron picket while it was being rammed, and his hand was too high on the picket.<br><br>3. This happened a couple of metres from me during my ANCO course.   A fellow trainee got his index finger in the way of an M71 breech block when it closed.   His finger was chopped off.   The trainer retrieved the finger but it could not be reattached.<br><br>These three incidents happened in my active unit.   Luckily they did not turned into tragedies.<br><br>4. While returning from an exercise, an M71 hooked to a MAN truck in my battery deattached itself while travelling and slammed into the middle of a traffic junction.<br><br>5. While travelling to an NDP rehearsal, one of our 25pounders detached itself in the middle of a junction.   It moved under its own momentum across the junction.<br><br>6. During a 155 life firing in Thailand, one of my rounds landed kilometres from the target zone and landed in a padi field.   Luckily, no one was hurt, but unconfirmed report stated that a cow got in the way and was turned into hamburger patty.</div>

I'm not clear about the incident but from what I heard, the cadets were all playing a fool at that moment before the accident.  Damn immature.<br><br>A gun shot victim could survivy a shot if (a) the shot did not damage major organs, (b) the bullet went clean through the victim without ricocheting, (c) the victim does not go into immediate shock &amp; (d) the victim is sent to the nearest hospital in the shortest possible timing.  Of course, immediate first aid should be done by stopping the flow of blood from the entry &amp; exit wound.  In the movies, they always block the entry wound only.</div>

In the School of Artillery, the OCS batch before my ANCO course, an officer cadet stood between an M71 hooked on a MAN 7t truck.   When the truck moved off, the gun ran over the cadet killing him.<br><br>6. During a 155 life firing in Thailand, one of my rounds landed kilometres from the target zone and landed in a padi field.   Luckily, no one was hurt, but unconfirmed report stated that a cow got in the way and was turned into hamburger patty.</div></blockquote>*salute!!*<br>You must be a lao chiao or an very senior warrant.<br>The M71 is now on perm display/storage, or at least last i saw them in Khatib.<br><br>I remember seeing photos of the first incident you mentioned (OCT). Those are black/white, and one photo even showed part of the head, with cerebral matter on the asphalt.<br><br>Even today, Artillery is still quoting the cattle incident. So was it one cow, or a herd of cows?<br><br>And to finish off, there was an Fh2K incident last year, in which an SGT's arm got mauled. Severely.
