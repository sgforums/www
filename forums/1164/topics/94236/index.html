            <div class='col-md body'>I personally witnessed the overturning of a AMX13-SM1 on 07/07/1994 in Basic Main Range during a Armour Skill &amp; Arms practice where the vehicle tank commander was crushed to death. The young 20 years old 2SG died on the spot with a crushed face. So sad !!<br><br>Barely a year ago in 1993, one of this 2SG's commander tank also overturned and died on the foot of Jasmine in TVMA.<br><br>I am just trying to share these unhappy incidents and hope for no repeated accidents.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Many years ago another tragic accident this time involve only one man.<br><br>This one also involve armour. What I understand was that someone on the ground  got shot by the vehicle-mounted 7.62 GPMG at very close range becos of accidental discharge or something.<br><br>The trooper was shot in the thigh but despite immediate action done to save his life, he bled to death. The femora artery or something was severed.<br><br>This one to me was particularly tragic because you would think that someone shot in the leg during training in Singapore could have been saved easily.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I have heard abt the story that tvdog have said by my SOA instructors. It happened after a live-firing exercise in Crescendo. They have an IA at the range but didn't clear it there,instead they went back to vehicle shed. One crew member(i think is tank comdr) is clearing the IA back in the vehicle shed when a shot is fired and hit a driver doing AOS on another tank directly opposite.The round first hit the opposite tank then hit his thigh. That poor guy died....Come to think of it Jasmine knoll seems to be the steepest among the knolls in the training areas,so it is highly possible that accidents can happen. However i think after the accident, they have made the track flatter and thus safer. Remember your TSR,Safety first guys!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I also heard a drowning case from those lao-jiao during one of the ICT.<br><br>It was back in 1984 during a floation exercise where a soldier was drown in the current floation reservoir. Apparently, when the M113 was sinking, the poor chap was entangled by his barang barang, ie webbing and weapon. He was drowned. During that time, his platoon sergeant, now I think a warrant officer(AngTH). His buddy dream of him asking him to burn his belongings ... till now the M113 is still deep in that reservoir.<br><br>Becos of this case, the SAF started to train using the Jettison drill during floation training.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>THis is not SAF,but NCC.<br><br>When I was in Sec.2 in 2001 at the 25m LIVE FIRE range,got this cock from Bishan Park.Upon commencement of firing,he discovered he had an IA.So the normal procedure would be always to apply the selector to the SAFE position 1st.It was a half-feeding.But for some unknown reason,he did not do so.He instead turned the weapon backward and said to the SAF 2Lt. who was the Conductiing Officer and reported the IA.<br><br>He was promptly given a complete F**K-over by the 2Lt. It was then discovered that this idiot in question had placed the weapon in AUTO and lucky for him it had developed an IA and did not go off.If not there will be plenty of butts which will be buttered.This guy was barred from firing till everyone had finished and was watched closely by the Conducting Officer, Range CSM and several other NCOs.<br><br>Thus I would seriously appeal to all those enlisting,enlisted and have not gone through your live fire at the range yet.PLEASE!!!PLEASE pay attention at when technical handling lessons on your weapons are conducted and to pay extra caution.As the lives of the people around you depend on what you do.<br><br>(**PS.JUST TO SIDE-TRACK ALITTLE,CAN ANYONE EXPLAIN WHY IS IT THAT IN THE RANGE,THE AUTO MODE IS NEVER USED?AND CAN ANYONE SHARE WHEN IS THE AUTO MODE USED DURIN TRAINING,THANKS)</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I would suppose that at range, one pull of the trigger on auto mode, would mean there goes your rounds, whether you have 3, 5, or 10.  But I have used the auto mode at section l/f.  Gimme single shot anytime. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"><br><br>Another thing to note, auto mode does wear out the bolt faster, so technical wise, not many will like it.  Those who've handled the SAW and GPMG, they are automatic weapons by themselves.  Hold your GPMG tight when firing, the recoil can bring your shots everywhere, i mean everywhere.

I beg to disagree. A good soldier will ALWAYS remember to treat a weapon just as what it is, a weapon. He will NEVER hold it with one hand and trigger off, pointing it to the ground. He will make it a second nature to always check clear before triggering off, and at other times leave his finger out of the trigger guard.</div>

It happened after a live-firing exercise in Crescendo. They have an IA at the range but didn't clear it there,instead they went back to vehicle shed. One crew member(i think is tank comdr) is clearing the IA back in the vehicle shed when a shot is fired and hit a driver doing AOS on another tank directly opposite.The round first hit the opposite tank then hit his thigh. That poor guy died....Come to think of it Jasmine knoll seems to be the steepest among the knolls in the training areas,so it is highly possible that accidents can happen. However i think after the accident, they have made the track flatter and thus safer.
