              <p>Personally I have no issue with carrying a sidearm, you don't need to haul a lot of ammo for it, one or two extra clips would be good in a pinch. I don't think our soldiers will suffer a big performance drop from it, if that was the concern I remember there was some talk in here about how body armour was useless because it added weight, and that's a lot of extra weight.</p>
              <p>Ultimately there's no right or wrong, it depends on what you want, but I don't think our average soldier is so weak that he can't haul an extra pistol.</p>
              <p>If you are really iffy about weight then go get a compact pistol, that should put your mind at ease.</p>

              <p>Erm, wrong. You can't adopt a two handed stance for your pistol but you still can fire it one handed, and with a lot more sucess then trying to shoot your rifle one handed.</p>
              <p>In any case the value of a sidearm has been well known in history, the trusty Colt .45 was a staple of the American G.I. and this was considering he had to lug an battle rifle that is a lot heavier then our current assualt rifles.</p>

              <p>Barring the fact that it is extremely difficult to hide something like a CPW properly and then yet be able to take it out easily, doing such a thing is also considered a war crime under the Geneva conventions, something that you can be hung for.</p>

              <p>"peacetime &amp; training mindset"? <br>Great if base on your theory just blame unusable rifles or stoppages all to war !</p>
              <p>Wake up Best Soldiers in the world also get shot and killed ? <br>You choose to talk about those that got killed , why not talk about those that live think more survive then those killed.</p>
              <p>Many real war accounts of soldiers being wounded in an arm &amp; still able to ...... ? Yeap some are, other don't ... those who survive can tell their verison. Why don't you tell a few of those which soldier shot still able to use their primary weapons.<br> <br>Most of those troops with sidearms, are special forces, airborne , rangers, SAS, commandos .... because in most army they have extra budgets to issue sidearms and are train to use them. <br>The point is simple - they are issue and train with sidearms, other ordinary soldiers are usually not this is fact not mindset. Yes an enemy bullet does not distinguish between special forces or normal infantry. But then why you call those folk special forces ? You call them that because they are fitter, better train &amp; better equipped, that why they are issue with extra side-arms when a lot of ordinary soldiers are not.</p>
              <p><br>Didn’t the Army teach you how to avoid heatstroke, not to accidently discharge weapons, train you to be fighting fit? <br>Based on the last few years of casualties in the army and funny videos posted on youtube - obviously you may have learn, but not a lot of others.<br><br>You said  “ I believe that even our own troopers carried the SIG226 when in Timor Leste”. <br>Ok i got you -  we believe we have gundams too !!!</p>

              <p>Exactly right, the ones who live are the ones carryingthe side arms &amp; living to tell the tale because the side arms saved them .</p>

              <p>with switched off guys like you ... better to leave the important task of soldiering to the switched on guys. Do join the Drama troop &amp; make everyone laugh with your storytelling.</p>

              <p>Unfortunately, there is a peacetime and training mindset among us all &amp; when we think primary weapon failure, we think mechanical failure due to poor maintenance , proper usage etc. The words "soldier proof"   reminds us that weapons must be designed to take on the abuse in real war situation &amp; weapons failure will be due to this factor, but not this factor alone. </p>
              <p>Primary weapons failure also occurs when one gets shot at, which jhappens quite often when you are in a war zone.  A grenade fragment or AK47 round may displace or damage your rifle. One may also get shot in one arm or hand which makes it impossible to work your rifle or conduct  IA. In the meantime you are faced with the enemy 10 feet away. The only option is a quick draw with a pistol &amp; squeezing  off a few rounds at 10 feet. 15 rounds of 9mm is better than 0 rounds of 5.56mm. </p>
              <p>Armies &amp; soldiers who have real war experience are issue sidearms ( when their budgets are big enough to issue their combat front line troops in the warzone  with them  ) because primary weapons failure is a life &amp; death issue exemplifiedby  the close quarter urban battles experienced in Iraq &amp; Afghanistan.</p>
              <p>In a warzone, I will carry that extra 850g or 1 kg  seal my enemies fate rather than mine.</p>

              <p>I think there's been a lot of over-dramatization over the need for a pistol sidearm in this discussion. </p>
              <p>Although I'm in favor of one, it is really just an extra-useful thing to carry around.</p>
              <p>I think the prospect of SAF issuing a sidearm at the current moment is probably close to nil.  Mainly because the budget is needed elsewhere where there are bigger fish to fry.</p>
              <p>From the organizational perspective, does issuing every infantryman with a sidearm contribute to solving the FIBUA / MOUT problem?  I think the contribution is negligible. </p>
              <p>Instead, money could be channeled into getting more of those little surveillance grenade/balls (whatever they're called), Dragonskin ( i wish ), and neat little RC toys.  It seems that doctrinal development is moving towards the direction of "3G", where the pistol's contribution is slight marginalized. </p>
              <p>To start issuing infantrymen with pistols would require those guys at Mindef/Army to come up with some really interesting doctrine.  At this moment, I can't really imagine what they would be.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Sidenote:  Our Police Force officers sent to East Timor will be armed with a pistol... I believe its a Glock... </p>

              <p>Where small arms is concerned , the most pressing need the SAF has  to address at this moment is to channel some funds for decent  night  sights  for all  SAR 21s.    </p>
              <p>The SAR 21 also needs to shed some weight ; less 1/2  kg  will be great.</p>
              <p>SAF can do also with much better sighting equipment and more lethal ammo for M203s.</p>

              <p>I agree, it's too much drama over such a mundane issue. I almost loled when I saw storywolf trying to imply that carrying an extra pistol will cause extra training deaths in the SAF... seriously, come on... let me get this straight... storywolf is an officer during NS? What is happening to our screening process?</p>
              <p>Anyway unless storywolf wants to argue the SAF is making a big mistake or the pictures are photoshopped, this "argument" is pretty much over, the fact it started at all shows the inability of some not to make a mountain out of a molehill.</p>
