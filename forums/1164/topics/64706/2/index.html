            <div class='col-md body'>FYI Malaysian GGK racial composition basicly half of them Malay the rest Indian,iban,chinese,orang siam and other natives tribes compared to SAF Cdo which more than 80 percent were Chinse.And the cutting off enemy heads tradition were not part of the iban legacy copied by GGK.....but more or less part of the GGK pysops SOP.Imagine the impact -if th enemy recon force were found dead....minus the body <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_twisted.gif" alt="Twisted Evil" title="Twisted Evil"> For the record GGK and Kopassus (yes...the bad ass Indonesian SOF) do trained together hence most of old school GGK wear the Kopassus insignia.For the record SAS also eat or taste part of the enemy blood.....during operation Claret cross border attack against the Indonesian were part of the evidence of this gruesome habit.<br>Even Andy Mcnabb came here (Malaysia) back in the late 80s to gained some jungle warfare knowhow from GGK.It really shows GGK abilities and reputation as the world leading names in COIN.<br><br>BTW the pig brain soup aint the same as raw human ones <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_twisted.gif" alt="Twisted Evil" title="Twisted Evil"><br>PKM started off in Singapore back in the 30s within the Chinese workers union then spread out the insurgency style warfare to the peninsular.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>HARIMAU, mind giving a reference for the SAS's bloodthirstiness? I would be quite interested to read about that.<br><br>I still do not think it is a good idea. It is one thing to convince the enemy you're crazy, but it's another thing to actually be crazy. For example, the Gurkha do not eat babies or cut off heads, though they are indeed fierce knife fighters. The story of their Kukhris needing to taste blood before they can be sheathed is also not true. I however respect and understand why they allow such myths to perpetuate themselves. They make an already fearsome force terrifying.<br><br>Seriously, if the GGK really were cannibals by policy, that would seriously lower their reputation in my eyes and make them a liability to Malaysia. No doubt they are one of the best in jungle COIN ops --Malaysia has been actively fighting insurgents till only quite recently. But being cannibals and savages will not frighten their enemies -- it will only disgust them and drive them to destroy the GGK faster, not to mention make GGK commandoes really ill. Human flesh tends to contain germs that actually infect humans -- it's the dirtiest meat you can eat, especially raw. What are they thinking?<br><br>I am less impressed by the GGK after reading this. I might even burst into laughter if I had to face them. You had might as well demonstrate your bravery by shooting yourself in front of the enemy -- wow, you are badass... and really dumb.</div>

It was just a side cynical joke to say that those guys did what they did not becoz of their training, it was more due to being psycho into doing so by peer pressure or plain superstitious believes....just like when i drank that soup, not becoz i was trained to do so, more like i didn't want to hear anymore of my mum's nagging.</div>
