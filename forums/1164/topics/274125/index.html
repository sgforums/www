            <div class='col-md body'>Singapore reveals jungle trials using micro unmanned air vehicles<br>By Peter La Franchi<br><br>Singapore's Defence Science and Technology Agency has been conducting co-operative research with the US Defence Advanced Research Projects Agency to assess the effectiveness of micro unmanned air vehicle operations in jungle environments.<br><br>Two series of operational and technical experiments have been conducted over the past two years, says the Singapore agency's deputy chief executive for technology, Peng-Yam Tan. The air vehicle used in the research has been the Aerovironment Wasp MAV.<br><br>Tan told the Association for Unmanned Vehicle Systems International's Unmanned Systems North America conference in Washington on 7 August that the research has focused on how MAVs "would feature in the three scenarios of conventional, jungle and maritime surveillance and the implications of the tropical environment".<br><br>The first round of experiments was carried out in October 2005. The second took place in October 2006 using a Singapore air force Eurocopter Super Puma helicopter as a UAV surrogate. It was used to fly a variety of developmental sensor payload types that could be carried by an MAV in a jungle environment.<br><br>Tan said this included hyperspectral sensors, three-dimensional radar, and day and night cameras.<br><br>The co-operative research included examination of MAV operations in both open and closed canopy jungle environments.<br><br><a href="http://www.flightglobal.com/articles/2007/08/09/215974/singapore-reveals-jungle-trials-using-micro-unmanned-air.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.flightglobal.com/articles/2007/08/09/215974/singapore-reveals-jungle-trials-using-micro-unmanned-air.html</a></div>

With a wingspan of 41 cm and a weight of 275 grams the Wasp is AV's smallest UAS. Wasp can be manually operated or programmed for GPS-based autonomous navigation. To ensure system interoperability, Wasp uses the same advanced technology found in other AV small UAS systems, such as Raven RQ-11B, Swift and Puma, and is controllable through a common Ground Control Station. </blockquote></a></strong><br><img src="http://www.avinc.com/images/userPub/product-web-WASP-blockIII-lg.jpg"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Anyway, these successful tests would prove that the algorithms for UAVs in used(or potentially in used) by Singapore and the US are very advanced. You are talking about evading branches and all manner of vegetation; and worse still at night !! This is very impressive. We have come very very far. Our research is this field is very advanced.<br><br>I think it would be most useful at night where these wasps will be virtually undetected. Also, it would be hard to see and target if seen during the day. An enemy commander would be put in a hard spot if one of these MAVs is spotted. Withdraw immediately? Or risk an imminent attack within seconds from, say, artillery fire, 120mm mortars, missiles, etc. Enemy plans can go up in smoke in seconds.

            <div class='col-md body'>Here's the Batmobile:<br><br>U.S. Air Force Takes Delivery of BATMAV Micro Unmanned Aircraft Systems from AeroVironment<br>8/6/2007<br><br>WASHINGTON, At AUVSI North America, Aug. 6, 2007 Â– AeroVironment, Inc. (AV) (NASDAQ: AVAV), a leader in unmanned aircraft systems and efficient electric energy systems, today announced that the U.S. Air Force has recently taken delivery of its initial BATMAV micro unmanned aircraft systems (UAS), which include the Wasp III air vehicle, as planned under the Air Force Beyond Line of Site (BLOS) program.   AV received the BATMAV, or Battlefield Air Tactical Micro Air Vehicle, award in December 2006 after competing against a number of candidate systems.  AV recently received orders for 30 systems through the programÂ’s indefinite delivery/indefinite quantity (IDIQ) contract which provides for purchases of up to $45 million over a period of five years.<br><br><strong>Wasp III has a wingspan of 29 inches, weighs 1 pound and carries integrated forward and side looking electro-optical color cameras as well as a modular forward or side-looking electro-optical or infrared payload.  The system is backpackable and is capable of operating for up to 45 minutes at up to 5 kilometers from the transceiver.  AV designed the system to support the Air ForceÂ’s Battlefield Airman Operators Kit.  Wasp III is a block III version of the Wasp micro UAS, which AV developed under a contract with the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA).</strong><br><br><strong>!!!!OMFG!!!</strong><br><br>Â“We were proud to be selected by the Air Force to support this program of record, which is the first such program for a micro air vehicle.  We are now eager to place new BATMAV systems into the hands of Air Force personnel on the battlefield so that they can operate more effectively<br><br>and safely,Â” said John Grabowsky, executive vice president and general manager of unmanned aircraft systems for AV.  Â“While Wasp III weighs only 1 pound, it provides many advanced technologies proven to be of extraordinary value across U.S. military services.  The Wasp III system can be operated with the same common ground control and user interface as AVÂ’s Raven and Puma small UAS.  This IDIQ is designed to enable other U.S. armed services to order these systems through the BLOS program, in addition to facilitating the procurement of BATMAV systems by the Air Force.Â”<br><br>The U.S. Armed ForcesÂ’ broad adoption of small and micro UAS has been accelerated by their demonstrated force protection and force multiplier advantages.  Each of AVÂ’s systems is backpackable, with aircraft that are hand-launched and act as sensor platforms to provide day and night, real-time video imagery to a common hand-held control unit used by tactical units for Â“over-the-hillÂ” and Â“around-the-cornerÂ” reconnaissance, surveillance and target acquisition.<br><br>AV has won three open competitions for U.S. Department of Defense small and micro UAS programs of record.  As a result AV is the sole supplier of these small UAS to U.S. Army, Special Operations Command, Marine Corps and Air Force programs.  To date, AV has produced more than 6,000 small and micro UAS including Raven, Dragon Eye, Puma and Wasp, and the U.S. Army alone has flown AVÂ’s Ravens for tens of thousands of hours in support of combat operations in Iraq and Afghanistan<br><br>About AeroVironment, Inc. (AV)<br><br>Building on a history of technological innovation, AV designs, develops, produces, and supports an advanced portfolio of Unmanned Aircraft Systems (UAS) and efficient electric energy systems.  The company's small UAS are used extensively by agencies of the U.S. Department of Defense and increasingly by allied military forces to deliver real-time reconnaissance, surveillance, and target acquisition to tactical operating units.  AVÂ’s PosiChargeÂ® fast charge systems eliminate battery changing for electric industrial vehicles in factories, airports, and distribution centers.
