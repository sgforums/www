Why because that story did not take into account of the technology and changes since world war 2.<br><br>There been huge growth in technology like airplanes ranges, drop tanks, air-refueling which totally redefine the range of operations of aircrafts. The range of dive bomber in world war II - 1,820 km. And those days you need a whole fleet of ships or a whole fleet of planes to take out ships or aircraft carrier.<br><br>Now ? Present day ? you just need a plane or a ship that carry just one harpoon missile ( itself 90km range ).  F-16  range now is 3,900 km, Fokker F-50 Maritime Patrol Aircraft (MPA) estimated to be 1,800 nm, will drop tank that will even enhance range. With radars and sateillites this even make the pin point of carrier groups like never before.<br><br>Do we really need a aircraft carrier to take out another aircraft carrier ? or bomb a place ? Think technology have reduce that need a lot .<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote>Whoever control Midway will have a control over a wide expense of the Pacific if they have sufficient naval and air power to police it. </blockquote>Sorry, wrong example. Midway was part of the Americans' Pacific atroll/island interests that ended up as a vital wartime operational base for them, but they didn't stake (or garrisoned) it that significantly prior.<br><br>From the Imperial Japanese standpoint, the biggest Allied naval-base threat to their territorial ambitions was two-fold: Pearl Harbour (USA) &amp; Singapore (GB). Hence their quick strategic strikes in late-'41/early-'42. Midway became important cuz it happened to be geographucally the next further American Far West staging post to stem the Japanese tide.<br><br>Sidetracking: One of the most enlightening discussions I've attended, one that happened to involve JC students, occcurred at the Fall of Singapore Anniversary conference a couple of years back. It was based on a side comment from one of the speakers, a NUS lecturer, who briefly highlighted on a great "what if" missed opportunity. The premise was this: the post WWI peace-treaties accentuated the mistrust between the Western colonial powers &amp; militarist Japan, &amp; the British adopted the "Singapore Strategy" - i.e. building of Sembawang Naval Base - to facilitate the deployment of a naval taskforce to out East.<br><br>The missed opportunity was what if British &amp; Holland had put aside their colonial rivalry &amp; enter into a marriage of military convenience against a common enemy (Japan)? What if, instead of Singapore, a concentrated naval base had been cooperatively built in, say, Bintan? Perhaps subsequent regional geopolitical developments would've created a different set of national soverignities, but Bintan could've still stood out ... as the South-east Asian version of Pearl Harbour before the Americans fortified their Pearl Harbour!<br><br>The JC students also informally took up that point further - I was more of a silent listener - &amp; suggested that if ASEAN ever unites enough into a Confederation (CONFSEAN, anyone?) or single Republic (Republic of South-east Asia?), that would be the kind of naval strategy the new entity would adopt, which in turn would make Australia a "strategic competitor" - to use George W. Bush's once-description of China.<br><br>Fascinating scenario, but IMO more plausible than the idea of regional armed forces buying aircraft carriers when most of them are still oriented towards counterinsurgency (rather than for conventional warfare).<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Sorry to push this thread up again.   Just saw a documentary a coupl of days back about modern US carriers.   It cost billions just to build one (missed out the exact figures but distinctly heard "billions").   It takes <strong>USD440,000,000</strong> a year to operate it.<br><br>This costs only reflects that of the carrier, and does not include the fleet needed to support the carrier.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Er!! I think we share most of our national interest with US and other western nations. Since we have some much in common, any chaotic situations which requires deployment of relatively large amount of combatant destinated an area far off the region beyond S.E.A need not be us.The Country which presumably mightly will most probably initial an involvement.<br>Thats why she have the largest fleet of Carriers around.<br><br>Realistically we are a tiny nation, located in the centre of S.E.A with aircrafts and defense technology capable enough to govern our nation. Beside having met the fundemental criteria for possessing weaponary, our current forces based mainland have the range for external power projection with a wide circumference covering most of our region thats our priority. Why do we need Carrier to project! <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"> .<br><br>Wanna send aircraft use KC-135R la<br>if you guys are fond of singapore possessing one an idea go provoke a nation which have an ocean barrier in between dont need US just india will do  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br></div>

Which we already deployed, we will get a total of 4 of these LST each can easily take up to 2 helicopters , with a few fast craft onboard .  Think it is more practical to build more or bigger LST if needed.<br><br>However the ideal of aircraft carrier and helicopter carrier, which the cost  of building and cost maintain it and staff it is way so high that, we need no  natural disaster, and Singapore will already be in total finance disaster and in need of help ourselves for making stupid spending like that.</div>
