Just dun see the operation needs.</div></blockquote>Yeah, I agree completely. Why would we need an aircraft carrier when our territorial waters are so limited. We aren't even a major military projection power. And taking in account our most credible potential military threats, we are already so physically close to any potential threat, we wouldn't need to have an aircraft carrier to extend our strategic reach.<br><br>BTW, when you say "mini aircraft carrier," you don't mean one that carries mini planes right?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Even a mini aircraft carrier like the Hermes or the USMC LPH need to broaden their mission statement. Cannot sole rely on 'power projection'. You can't own prorperty until you set foot on it.<br><br>Anyway go back to basic SAF mission, it does not include expanding our "leberstram" (?sp) or living space (bing justification by Nazi and Weimer germany starting WWII and I respectively). Ita being a posion shrimp and  pain in some people's butts to force them to think we can be bullied etc.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Shucks man...... if we do get ourselves an aircraft carrier, it's going to costs a bomb. In fact, bombs are much cheaper than carriers.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br><br>What's more, carriers do not operate on their own. I'm sure this has been said before already..... You need all sorts of other support ships. Destroyers, cruisers, minesweepers.... you name it. I think half of the RSN flett would have to be deployed just for one carrier group.<br><br>Even assuming that we have the money and the ships, do we even have enough manpower? The manpower required for a single carrier isn't the same as that required for a missle gunboat. It would take thousands of people just to man a single carrier..... not to mention the number of pilots we would need.<br><br>Anyway, if and when we do go to war it'll be regional. We will never go to war with China or India, simply because we don't have the resources to do so. Our aircraft flying out of our airbases can reach the surrounding countries within minutes of taking off.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>interesting.. having a floating fortress out at south china sea should really solved our RSAF training restriction. but i think the cost of maintaining one will surely eat deeply into the budget.. and the end result is more taxes in years to come. simply put, it's more economical to have friendly bases around the region than to have an aircraft carrier. just think of the manning strength required. gigiantic.</div>

Armed with harpoons our vipers can hit any surface target on south china sea..<br><br>Projection of power? I say conduct a live harpoon missiles firing exercise with our viper or F50 on the south china sea is adequate.<br><br>Who needs a carrier?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br><br></div>
