Firstly, it costs the earth. Secondly, what you said about S'pore sinking doesn't make an ounce of sense. So what if S'pore sinks before the aircraft carrier? Even if the aircraft carrier is still afloat, with S'pore "sunk", there's not much use for the carrier is there?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>US deploys their carriers in the gulf 'cos its ridiculous to expect US fighter jets to fly from the US all the way to Iraq, carry out their mission then fly back to the US. S'pore on the other hand does not have any enemy or potential enemies that are located so far away from us.<br><br>And you obviously have no grasp of politics at all. What makes you think you can suka suka park your carrier in Indonesia if we go to war with M'sia? Don't forget, you need clearance from Indonesia to enter their waters. And in case you didn't know, ASEAN has a policy of non inteference. So there's no way Indonesia will allow our carrier to park in their waters 'cos it would be seen as helping us against M'sia.<br><br>And it is most childish thinking that we can simply run to the US for help. If that's the case, why bother having SAF for?<br><br>It would be prudent to think in depth first before expressing one's views.</div>

Unlike Western navies which have large fleets with huge involvements, they need a support ship. While our 6 Frigate have a range of 7200kms, our Endurance have more and we dun have to operate that far often, do we need a support ship?<br><br>In the Gulf, our Endurance is the support ship for the Coalition vessels. It of cause not as delicate as a support ship, but it provided medical support, fueling point, functioned with some commanding roles, central sentry post and there is even an ammo dump within it.<br><br>But anyway, what i see is not important but what RSN see is important, you might be right!</div>

Each aircraft carrier need a whole battle group to protect it to be safe from enemy ships, airp planes and submarines. Take the US battle group - a typical group will have 2 missile cruisers, 2 destoryers, one frigate,2 submarine, 1 supply ships and others like mine sweepers.<br><br>Even if the carrier itself need 1000+ man to operate, and billions to build, and millions to operate daily. Would it not be better to build use those money to build a few advance cruisers, which can fire cruise missiles instead ? or to buy advance planes and rent foreign airfield ?<br><br></div>

The reality is no regional country has extended overseas interests to finance a AC; the various countries' existing airbases &amp; naval bases are operationally appropriate enough, augmented by the ASEAN &amp; FDPA arrangements.<br><br>Like other posters on this board, I can foresee strengthening/upgrading of the purer maritime forces (both individually &amp; collectively) though. But, in Singapore's case, my feeling is we'll choose to bolster the naval bases more instead, if only to faciliate better the American &amp; Commonwealth taskforces that occasionally visit our shores (&amp; indirectly act as a deterrent).<br><br>That's basically been our historical load to carry, even as we sought to protect ourselves militarily post-independence. The whole pre-WWII "Singapore Strategy" - i.e. the building &amp; upkeep of the British Naval Base at Sembawang - was that it's ill-affording to station a permanent fleet within the region to protect colonial interests, but a local facility can be established from which operations can be launched.<br><br>The new Changi Naval Base - cost between $33m-$35m - should thus be viewed from this perspective, vis-a-vis the regular FDPA exercises that partly launched from the facility.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Just want to point out:<br>1) F-16 C/Ds (or any of the F-16 versions) are NOT capable of carrier based take off. Aircraft taking off from carriers have to be capable of taking off within a very short stretch of pavement when compared to an air base's run way. Not all military aircraft can do this.<br><br>2) Of the three shortlisted aircraft for the Next Generation Fighter Programme, only one, the French-made Dassault Rafale is capable of carrier based flight... and as far as I know, MINDEF is not looking at the carrier version of the Rafale.<br><br>3) Not ALL Joint Strike Fighters will be able to take off from carriers. Only the Navy and Marine versions will be capable of such flight. These versions will definitely cost more than the simpler Air Force version.<br><br>Hence: To get a carrier, we will end up spending LOTS more since we'll have to start building a Naval Air Wing from SCRATCH.</div>
