            <div class='col-md body'>Thailand's aircraft carrier is a white elephant. As we speak, its rusting in the docks as they can't afford to send it out to sea.<br><br>Anyway, I feel an aircraft carrier (mini or otherwise) is a waste of money. Yes, today's newspaper it was reported that M'sia is looking to buy a supply ship for their navy which can also serve as a mini aircraft career. But that doesn't mean we need to resort to tit for tat tactics.<br><br>Think about it, who is our most likely adversary should war break out? M'sia. And geographically we are so close to them, that it probably makes more sense to launch or fighter jets from airbases rather than from carriers. Yes, airbases are prone to attack, but so are carriers. What's worst, if a carrier gets sunk, not only is the carrier lost but also all the jets &amp; copter aboard it.<br><br>This joker I spoke to said that if S'pore gets attacked, the carrier can always sail off &amp; then launch its fighter jets to counter attack. I guess he forgot that carriers aren't exactly know for speed. Also, the enemy's navy &amp; airforce will NOT allow the carrier to sail away &amp; will do their utmost to sink it.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>The reason why the US needs aircraft carriers is 'cos they are always sticking their noses in other ppl's affairs. Be it Korea, Taiwan, Iraq or watever. It is obviously ridiculous to launch fighter jets from their airbases in the US, ask them to fly all the way from US to Korea, Taiwan or Iraq, complete their mission &amp; then fly back to the US.  So for them, aircraft carriers are the logical choice as they can sail the entire carrier group near these countries &amp; then launch their jets from there.<br><br>Now there's no way in hell S'pore is gonna be involved in a war with some far away country like China or India. So what's the justification for an aircraft carrier? What are we gonna do? Sail it right into M'sian waters &amp; launch jets from there? First of all, the M'sian navy &amp; airforce will definitely aim to sink our carrier (together with all its jets).<br><br>Secondly, do you have any idea how much time, resources &amp; money is involved each time you launch a carrier? And not to mention the risks taken if we are sending it into M'sian waters. Since M'sia is so geographically close to S'pore, it makes no sense to dispatch a carrier, especially since its faster, cheaper &amp; more practical to launch from our airbases.<br><br>Malaysia is not a 10 hour flight from S'pore. If it is, I concur that we need a mini carrier. M'sia is so near to S'pore that barring any AA fire, our jets can probably reach it in under 10 mins after being scrambled.<br><br>And if we don't intend to sail the carrier into M'sian waters, then to where? To the Indian ocean?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">  Into Thailand perhaps? Firstly, we need to obtain clearance to sail a naval vessel into another country's waters. Clearance which may NOT be granted. And even if its granted, tell me, how practical is it to sail our carrier into Thai waters &amp; then launch jets from there, attach M'sia &amp; then return to the carrier?<br><br>And keep in mind, carriers need to be resupplied. We ain't talking about a nuclear powered carrier like the USS Nimitz you know. Being the slow moving ship that it is, when the carrier goes back to S'pore to be resupplied &amp; then sails back to its original place, its a sitting duck.<br><br>It would be nuts to send out a carrier by itself. Hence the need for carrier groups like those in the US navy. I can't recall the exact composition of the USN's carrier group but I believe there are 1 or 2 submarines, a fast patrol craft &amp; several gunboats or corvettes.<br><br>Our navy doesn't have a whole lot of vessels to begin with. If we dispatch several of them to be part of our carrier group, what on earth will be left for us to use to defend S'pore &amp; also to attach M'sian vessels? Don't forget hor, some of our vessels like the LSTs are also needed to support the army.<br><br>IMO, its just not practical financially &amp; operationally to operate a carrier or mini carrier. The money would be better spent on newer submarines or replacing our missile corvettes (since our missile gunboats are being replaced by stealth frigates).</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I think the Malaysian man who initial the idea of having a support ship/aircraft carrier is just plain stup... innocent.<br><br>1) Getting a Support ship - this is possible as Malaysia seriously need one to support a tri-operation with center of gravity at sea. It is technically and financially possible for malaysia to procue.<br><br>2) Claiming that the support ship can be an aircraft carrier is not very wise. Firstly if the support ship is a LPD, it is definately in the eye of amateur not an aircraft carrier. It is apparent that he want to stir up some nationalism within the country by saying that the MAF might be getting an aircraft carrier. <span style="font-style: italic;">* you know the malaysia boleh theory?</span><br><br>Secondly if Malaysia is realli going for an aircraft carrier perhaps the displacement of the French Mistral or spanish Andrea, it is even more naive. How in the world they expect their carrier to carry out it's duty without her airforce achieving air superiority? This certainly beyond mi.<br><br>malaysia boleh!</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Yeap It's confirmed i think m'sia is buying aircraft carrier.<br><br>KUALA LUMPUR - The Malaysian Armed Forces wants to buy early-warning aircraft and a multi-role support ship to be used as a floating command centre.<br><br>Malaysian Armed Forces chief Mohd Zahidi Zainuddin<br>Armed forces chief Mohd Zahidi Zainuddin said these military assets were required to safeguard the busy Strait of Malacca, patrol border areas and tackle complex security threats such as <strong>terrorism</strong>.<br><br>'I hope the government will approve the procurement of these assets,' he said in several media interviews to mark the 71st anniversary of the armed forces earlier this week.<br><br>The aircraft he wants are equipped with an early-warning defence system and detection capabilities which are faster and more accurate than ground radar. The support ship, besides being a command centre, can also function as an <strong>aircraft carrier.</strong><br><br>In the interviews, Gen Mohd Zahidi also stressed the importance of transparency and openness in the military.<br><br>Referring to criticism that was voiced when he assumed his duties five years ago, he said: 'I know a lot of people were saying 'how can there be transparency and openness when the armed forces chief's post is always reserved for the army?' I think I have proved these people wrong.<br><br>'At that time, I think the reason why the post of armed forces chief always fell to an army man was because the army chief was a full general, while the chiefs of the other services were three-star lieutenant-generals.'<br><br>He added: 'Since I took over, the government has decided to make the air force and navy chiefs four-star generals. So now, any of the chiefs from the three services can become the armed forces chief.<br><br>'This is one of the things I meant when I said there should be transparency and openness. My successor when I eventually retire will be picked by the government based on <span style="font-style: italic;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>merit</strong></span></span>.'<br><br>Under his leadership, the armed forces has been modernised with purchases of high-tech submarines, fighter jets, helicopters and battle tanks.<br><br>The recent launch of a joint command for the army, navy and air force to carry out joint operations to safeguard national security was another feather in his cap.<br><br>The general, whose job contract has been extended to next year, said he would now focus on air and naval defence. -- Utusan Malaysia,New Straits Times<br>-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br><br>I think its dumb for sg to follow m'sia ways to purchase aircraft carriers.<br>instead we should get jets which can multirole and equip with stronger variants of harpoon or exocet , but with tactical nuke..<br><br>to counter thieir aircraft carrier..should we get F-15 E..think we should use<br>the Mach 2.5 speed to outrun them...upon approaching target..<br><br>fires 2 advanced tactical nuke..at their carrier...gone liao..<br><br>muahahahah,furthermore the CDF so high-ranking..wonder if he did his considerations..first..<br><br>Furthermore m'sia dun have the assets to guard the aircraft carrier..<br><br>the AWACS are also quite useless bah..<br><br>The CDF also very funny 1 leh!
