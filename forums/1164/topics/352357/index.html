              <p>It would interest you to know that self development of fighter planes has been a desire of India for 5X years now.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The problem has been engines.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Even in the early years, India manufactured the HF-24 marut fighter and got into problems with the engine (Read about BOr, Orpheus 703, RD-9 issues).</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Fast forward to the LCA or Tejas. India wanted indigeneous engines ie Kaveri for the LCA. Went into a lot of problems and now ends up with the F404 after goodness knows how long a development period that practically guarantees the aircraft will be obselete on entry.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>China on the other hand, basically got into licensed production arrangements. Nevertheless it faces the same problems as India except that it had better capabilities in engine manufacture eg WP-9s for the J-7s. It still runs into issues eg lack of RD-93 for export FC-1s.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>India still does license productions fairly well eg Su-30mki except that the AL-31 engines are still proprietorily held by the Russians. China tried to copy the speys for the JH-7, took 20 years and still ended up signing a license production of the engine for the JH-7As.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Ultimately, if India is to be successful, it will need to manufacture its own engines. As the kaveri example shows, its not that easy.</p>

              <p>A good &amp; successful modern fighter is an immensely  complex machine.</p>
              <p>No country can afford to build one entirely on its own unless it has the time , will , money and talent to undertake such a Herculean effort. Even the Europeans have to join forces to build the state of the art Typhoon.  Economies of scale are critical.</p>

              <p>Yes, but the French and Swedes already have a long history of building fighters. However,  although Rafale and Gripen are excellent aircraft , I believe that they fill niche markets &amp; cost  per aircraft are rather high.  They are also produced in small quantities.</p>

              <p>Well considering planes either crash or land, its not a real surprise that crashes do happen.  Can't exactly park the plane in mid air and call the tow right?</p>
              <p>There are lots of measurements to how good an aircraft is.   The same aircraft might crash 3 times a year at Air Force B, and Once in 3 years at Air Force A.   It's the same aircraft, but different level of experience and maintenance.</p>
              <p>Naturally, maintenance friendly aircraft are more than welcomed.  If an aircraft has to switch out its engines everytime it lands... then theres really no point in keeping it.</p>

              <p><br>And so has India in the production of fighter aircraft. From the Harlow PC-5 to the Mig-21/27 variants to the Hawk fighters to the Su-30mki. Just that in most cases, these are licensed productions rather than self-designed ones. India's aircraft industry is not a young one. It would not be difficult for India to design an aircraft.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>India's fighter fleet has numbers requirements that can justify self production. That's why the Tejas was designed.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The problem as mentioned has always been to get a suitable engine for the fighter. That is a different case.</p>
