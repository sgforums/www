The same point applies to other assets.  In war, I am sure SCDF's helicopter will be used for the war effort anyway.<br><br>In such a small country as Singapore, and in a country with a limited budget, consolidating of assets is probably going to be the most efficient way of using those assets.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Originally posted by wonderamazement<br><blockquote>Why not give them the de-commissioned Hueys?</blockquote>I think this is a great idea.<br><br>1. No need to spend extra money to buy new helicopters other than maybe giving them a new paint job with new logo.<br><br>2. No need to train new pilots just used the same reservist RSAF pilots.<br><br>I am sure some of these Hueys will be kept in storage for emergencies such as war so just need to transfer a few reservist RSAF pilots and decommisioned helicopters in storage to either SCDF or SPF during war time. During peace time just have exercises with the equipment such as the SCDF giant 'water buckets' once in a while. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>FYI, SCDF DART is oredi trained in diving...dey even hav thier own inflatable rubber dingy...so i suppose tt ans ur doubt abt SCDF's water rescue capablity?<br><br>As for a helicopter, i believe incidents which involve the usage of helicopters for rescue are too few to justify the cost of owning even 1 helicopter. It would be more cost-effective to borrow and loan a helicopter from SAF<br><br>Mabi in the future when there are many incidents (*touch wood) which require SCDF to use a helicopter, there might be considerations 4 SCDF to own 1.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>To threadstarter, just a few questions and purposes in this thread:<br><br>1. It's good for each entities have their own unit of resources and logistics, but think of the long term, maintaining and managing logistics ain't going to be cheap.<br><br>2. The various home forces are right now pooling resources and maximising their strengths. In times of war, critical units will be strongly relied on either for offence or defence, and in times of peace, these critical units are constantly trained realistically to home in their capabilities. Even regularly, we have mobilisations for civil resources, and civil resources are a big untapped pool of resources that SPF and SCDF are working on refining and capitalising.<br><br>3. Remember Singapore has five arms of defences to make the longstanding Total Defence. We people also have a part to play, not totally depending on our law-enforcers and civil rescuers to do all the work. We can make a difference also.</div>
