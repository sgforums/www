            <div class='col-md body'>Sherman tanks are not light tanks.<br><br>Anyway, I guess S'pore will develope some sort of light tank on its own for several reasons : -<br><br>1.    there are no modern off the shelf  LTs ( not in  significant numbers<br>anyway ) in current operational use in the world ; most are mere<br>demos or  prototypes<br><br>2.    it already has developed Bionix which can be used as base for<br>development of a LT - I hope with a 105 mm gun and not larger -<br>120 mm will be unwieldy , impractical and the LT will have too little<br>space to carry a credible amount of  ammo<br><br>3.    LT's role , I believe for Spore context, shud be for fire support, recon /<br>scout  roles and not as a MBT killer - we already have that role fulfilled by<br>Leopard 2 A4s , Apache/ Hellfire , Spike, airforce Mavericks / LGBs.  The<br>terrain in Singapore defence context will still require a LT in many<br>scenarios.<br><br>4.    Time is running short for our SM1s as they currently cannot possibly fulfill<br>its LT role due to inadequate firepower and armor.<br><br></div>

Here are just a few.<br><br>1. Each Spike missile launcher can only be fired once then discarded, while a tank gun can be reloaded and fired continuously until the gun wears out.<br><br>2. A tank gun can fire more than one kind of ammo, while a Spike launcher can only fire a Spike missile which is mainly designed for anti-tank use.<br><br>3. Although a single Spike missile is much more accurate and sofisticated, it is very expensive compared to a single tank round.<br><br>4. Assuming that the platform is the same, the one with a tank gun is more likely to carry more ammo as compared to the Spike carrier.</div>

The original AMX-13 have already been extensively upgraded and any further upgrading will not make any economic or operational sense as the platform itself is simply way too old. Spare parts are very expensive as we are one of the very few countries producing them. And these old tanks break down easily and frequently requiring much spares.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"><br><br></div>

Any IFV with a 25mm armour piercing rounds are going to do SM1 good. DOn't forget that most IFVs' guns are stabalised, and SM1 gun is not.

We can mount Spikes on specialized Bionix. I think this will be better option.  This will add flexibility to an armored force which now can also have  long range AT capability.

A company of 6 to 8 Spike carriers per armor batallion will be good. </div></blockquote>UK Warriors do not have ATGWs....

And ours being a military with a forward defence doctrine need to be able to operate in such terrain.<br><br>Other countries military do not face such problem. The US and UK don't need a light tank in the flat plains in Europe against the then Soviet Union. They also don't need a light tank in the streets in Iraq and Afganistan because with lighter armour it is sucidal. Light tanks being smaller and lighter can follow with the IFVs into those tight spaces. The IFV can also keep up with the light tank better than a powerful MBT. What i am trying to say is that different military faces diferent problems and thus require different solutions.<br><br>Yes, the ATGM is a good tan killer, no doubt about that but how many of such missiles can an IFV carry into battle? These missiles don't come cheap too, they are much more expensive than the relatively simple tank rounds. And he ATGM launcher can only fire the same type of missile(although some multi-purpose) but the tank gun can definitely fire more more types of ammo for  different purposes such as knockng down walls in FIBUA.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Right, there are some targets for which  25 or 30 mm not powerful enough which 75 mm in SM1 is more suitable. However, SM1 needs to be replaced with new LT as SAF doctrine is such that there are many scenarios where only the LT can fit.<br><br>I think 105 mm firing standard ammo shud be the right choice of gun. It is more than enough to take out  light armor, bunkers, buildings &amp; with latest AT ammo , may even have a chance to take out a MBT in an emergency.<br><br>Many countries still use the NATO 105 standard and I think there is still some R &amp; D for this calibre.</div>

The BX is a capable platform with reasonable amount of armour and mobility to serve as a mobile gun platform. And it shares common parts with the IFV BX. The troop compartment behind can allow room for modifications such for ammo and fuel storage,maybe evencan carry a few troopers. The ability of th BX to sim is also a benefit.<br><br>However, there seems to be the problem that the BX chasis may not be able to withstand the firing of a large calibre gun such as the 105mm. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"></div>
