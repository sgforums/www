            <div class='col-md body'>Hi,<br><br>We already know that we are getting 66x Leo2A4.<br><br>This is definitely not enough to replace the 350 (Jane's) SM1s in our Orbat.<br><br>Do you think we are currently looking for a replacement? Or are we going to just forgo it?<br><br>What do you guys think?<br><br>I will start the "ball" rolling.<br><br>Maybe the order is just a preliminary one and there might be additional order for Leo2 MBTs in the future. The german army must have hundreds of Leo2s back in the cold war days...<br><br>Maybe we could replace it with another 150 Leo2 MBTs to have a total of 200 MBTs. This still less then the 350 SM1s for a 1 for 1 replacement.<br><br>However, with the BXs 30mm gun and the 40mm AGL, i think the need for a "light" tank has been reduced.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I'd say its morely likely that a new light tank will be locally developed. From designing a IFV to designing a light tank, I wouldn't say that the leap is VERY big. I think it'll be good for the industry if we could do that.

Like you had said, SM1s are just light tanks, so I dun see the logic of having a 1 for 1 replacement. With the NS liability reduced to just 2 years or less, do we have enough time to fully train up the new tankees? Gg for technicians... hauling up V12 engines! Or are they gonna leave the jobs to STK?</div></blockquote>The issue of whether to have one for one replacement has been widely debated.<br><br>The key of having sufficient critical numbers as being very important too. Think of it, an advanced tank can do so much more but still it cannot be involved in operations in 2 places at once. There has to be sufficient numbers to allow for fighting in several locations. And our neighbours are also improving their technological aspect too, cutting too much on numbers will negate even the edge of advanced technology.<br><br>I share the view that many ppl here have that the Leopard 2 is more of a replacement for the Centurion than the AMX-13. The new light/medium tank project is still alive and well, but don't expect to see it in service before 2010. Hence the need for a stopgap in the form of the Leopard 2. However, effectively upgraded these Leopard 2s would see continued service alongside whatever new tank/combat vehicle that STK comes up with and the existing fleet of other AFVs. The Centurions would be scrapped soon though; its days are numbered.</div>

No news so far though... but it would make it more a hybrid IFV/FSV, you might get a tradeoff in some ways.</div>
