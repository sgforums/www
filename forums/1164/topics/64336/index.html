The economy cannot be sustained with an aging population.<br><br>Migrating to other countries will not solve the problem as US &amp; Europe are facing this problem as well.<br><br>As for NS, be prepared that girls got to serve if the situation doesn't improve.</div>

I think, people like Care Corner will be able to give a lot of valuable advice.'<br><br>Last year, there were 40,864 births, down from 41,451 births in 2001. There were 31,171 births in the first nine months of this year, versus 33,618 in the same period last year.<br><br>Said Dr Tan: 'I think children are wonderful; they make life interesting.

Sometimes when girls complain about how painful such a creative process is, I wonder if they would gladly trade pregnancy for concentration camp victim conditions or life in the freezing foxholes where death comes either through extreme cold, trench foot, getting your limbs blown off by shells or your guts torn from your body by bullets leaving you to writhe on the ground bleeding out large amounts of blood.<br><br>Excuse me, but childbirth, noble as it may be, is no way near the top of humanity's greatest sufferings, if anything, men are right there alongside women in taking pain, if not, they tend to take more of the nonsense that humans do to each other.<br><br>So there.<br><br></div>

Lower (in fact, much lower) cost of living than S'pore or even Australia. The gov't here actually encourages you to have kids by contributing $$$ to your child's Edusave (they call its RESPs in Canada), so that they have money to go all the way to university without taking too much a burden on you. Plus, they give you plenty of tax breaks for having kids...public school fees( secondary level) is only about $35-40 a year; and you don't have to buy textbooks too...you just take a 'long-term loan' from the school library for the entire school year and then just return it at the end.

            <div class='col-md body'>Excuse me, while pregnancy and birth may be biologically amazing, and cause some amount of suffering, it would be unreasonable and illogical to say that this kind of suffering is the ultimate in terms of the human experience. Sometimes when girls complain about how painful such a creative process is, I wonder if they would gladly trade pregnancy for concentration camp victim conditions or life in the freezing foxholes where death comes either through extreme cold, trench foot, getting your limbs blown off by shells or your guts torn from your body by bullets leaving you to writhe on the ground bleeding out large amounts of blood.<br><br>Excuse me, but childbirth, noble as it may be, is no way near the top of humanity's greatest sufferings, if anything, men are right there alongside women in taking pain, if not, they tend to take more of the nonsense that humans do to each other.<br><br>So there.<br><strong><br><br>Well said tyro!</strong></div>
