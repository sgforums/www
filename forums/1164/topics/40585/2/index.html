            <div class='col-md body'>of course there's a twist to the name!! u think i can't spell?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br><br>the word play was quite popular in my camp when i was still serving... not that it has to do with an orc or anything (that would be giving the fool too much credit...)<br><br>personally, i like it and use it cos the first 2 syllable of <span style="font-style: italic;">Or Ci </span>fer, spoken in cantonese with the correct inflection means passing motion... which is pretty much what a useless officer is mostly capable of... wouldn't be surprised if some of them actually forget to bring toilet paper and have to call their runner by handphone to bring them some...<br><br>in case anyone's wondering, lets just say that i am not impressed with the conduct and performance of a lot of the "sirs" graduated from the <strong>O</strong>rganised <strong>C</strong>hicken <strong>S</strong>hit...<br><br>don't get me wrong... some of them have really learnt their lessons well and have taken seriously their training and become good officers and gentlemen (or ladies as the case might be...  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green">  ) they have earned the respect of ALL who have had the <strong>privilege</strong> of serving under them.<br><br>but it remains to be seen if a kid can suddenly be transformed into a leader of men through a wayang 10 month long course...<br><br>and i <strong>HAVE</strong> seen the scums and dregs who managed to fake through the system and fall through the sift... probably because of no better reason than the fact that Sg desn't have enough male babies.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_evil.gif" alt="Evil or Very Mad" title="Evil or Very Mad"><br><br>an average LCP rifleman is able to handle a combat situation better than those block-headed donkeys sometimes... who the hell do they think they are! many have had the <strong>misfortune</strong> of serving under such effluent-for-brains individuals as well...<br><br>if the SAF every goes into action, news of "Lions led by Donkeys" will certainly surface throughout the course of the incident...<br><br>and i happen to think that despite all other contributing circumstances surrounding the crash of the Courageous, it was precisely because a wayang Donkey did not do his job properly!<br><br>even the military has a "cover backside" culture, u can't exactly argue that the unfortunate officer was hung out to dry cos his superiors wanted to cover THEIR backside... what about HIMSELF?? didn't sound like HE paid much attention to doing his job properly, much less, covering his posterior...<br><br></div>
