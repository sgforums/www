            <div class='col-md body'><strong>Japan departs from pacifist stance, plans two aircraft carriers </strong><br>Perception of North Korean threat may have led to decision<br><br>By Richard Halloran<br><br>HAWAII - The Japanese navy is preparing to build two small aircraft carriers, its first in more than 60 years, according to Japanese and United States officials.<br><br>The plan is further evidence that Japan is departing from its pacifist post-World War II Constitution that restricts its military to self-defence.<br><br>The carriers can be deployed as command ships in a task force to give the Maritime Self-Defence Force, as the Japanese navy is called, a modest ability to project power into the sea-lanes that are vital to Japan's trading economy.<br><br>That capability is likely to draw protests from China, North Korea and South Korea, which were invaded by Japan during World War II.<br><br>Tokyo's decision to go ahead with the aircraft-carrier plan is believed to be prompted by its perception of an immediate threat from North Korea and a longer-term threat from China.<br><br>In its 2003 White Paper on defence published last week, the Self-Defence Agency asserted in more forceful terms than in earlier versions that the nation must build up its fundamental defence capabilities to ensure its independence.<br><br>In that respect, Japan is on the verge of building a missile defence. It has also just launched a second pair of intelligence satellites to watch North Korea.<br><br>Tokyo also recently passed laws giving the Self-Defence Forces wider latitude in defending their homeland.<br><br>Funds for the first small carrier have been included in Japan's defence budget for fiscal year 2004, beginning April 1 next year. The second carrier is scheduled for fiscal year 2005.<br><br>Japanese naval officers are calling the new ships 'destroyers' instead of 'aircraft carriers' in an effort to avoid triggering opposition from those against enhanced defence in Japan as well as from China and the two Koreas.<br><br>Yet drawings of the warship show the flat deck of an aircraft carrier and an 'island', or command structure, at the starboard or right edge of the deck.<br><br>Moreover, officials familiar with the ship's design said the deck and hangar below are capable of handling aircraft such as the joint strike fighter being developed by Lockheed Martin, a leading US defence contractor. That fighter, also called the F-35, is scheduled to go into production in 2008 just as the first Japanese carrier is ready for sea.<br><br>The F-35 will be a supersonic warplane capable of flying at 1 1/2 times the speed of sound. It will also incorporate stealth technology to enable it to evade radar detection.<br><br>The Japanese vessels will be comparable in size to Spain's 16,700-ton Principe De Asturias, which carries 17 planes.<br><br>The plan calls for equipping the carriers with new SH-60 Seahawk helicopters, which are designed to patrol the ocean, to detect submarines, and to protect the fleet.<br><br>The first ship is to be commissioned in 2008, the second in 2009. Two more may be built later.<br><br>An earlier proposal by the Self-Defence Forces to buy 'jump jets', that can fly as fighters or bombers, for four 14,700-tonne assault ships ran into political opposition. But that was before Japan got worried about North Korean missiles and nuclear arms.<br>------------------------------------------------<br><br>Oh well. . . not totally unexpected. . . but how soon will it be before the japs start thinking abt expansion again. . . haiz. . .<br><br></div>

Imperial Japan's actions have to be judged in the era of those times. The war (from their POV)  was fought in self-defence becos' of the view that they had only limited supplies of crude and raw material left. They felt let down by Western powers and saw it as blatant hypocrisy that Western powers were allowed to exploit and colonize regions of the world, while they had to play second fiddle. The Japanese did not reap any real benefits following the end of WWI except for the seizure of Tsingtao and some other former German concessions in China. The subsequent Washington Naval Conference proved to the Japanese that there was an 'old boys' club' and she was being excluded becos' she was yellow.<br><br>Of cos', in the war to rid the Pacific of Western colonialism and raw materials,  Japan replaced it with her own form of colonialism, forged out of brutality. That is definately unforgivable.<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from"></div><div class="quote_body">How we view Japan must never change until it acknowledges it's actions in WWII were wrong and apologises for its actions. Symbolic it may be, but it is what is required.<br></div></blockquote>Totally agree. But this has proven to be difficult and will still continue to be. The Japanese are a proud race; they are proud of their 'Yamato' roots and what it represents. Like many Asians, apologizing publicly is tremendous undertaking for them. They have chosen other paths instead, such as donating money to the building of hospitals, bridges, etc etc, in former conquered territories. The Japanese POV is that they too have paid the price for their belligerence in the Asia-Pacific by being the only state in the world that has been nuked...twice. The repercussions of that can still be felt today...my Japanese friend suffers from occasional headaches and rash outbreaks...all becos' her grandfather was a firefighter in Nagasaki at the time when the A-bomb was dropped, and the medical ailments resulting from radiation have been passed down from one generation to the next and will still continue to do so.<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from"></div><div class="quote_body">As for China being more expansionist, thats ridiculous.

Comforting thoughts?<br><br></div></blockquote>Totally agree. The Chinese naval capability is nothing more than 'brown-water' at this point of time. There were some aircraft carrier purchases from Russia, but as it turned out, they were sea-unworthy and pointless to refit and overhaul. One of it ended up being a floating casino. I think the other was cut up and sold for scrap.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br>In this case where Japan can develop nukes in a fortnight, its a question of first-strike and whether Japan possesses a second-strike capability. One thing we have to remember is that in raw numbers of land mass and population alone, China can inflict severe punishment on all of Japan's home islands (with devastating effects) and yet still absorb nuke attacks on its population and its cities and be functional.<br><br>We have to remember that modern Japan is not the same as Imperial Japan anymore. The world and more importantly, the region is not the same as circa 1941-42. I think that its time that Japan step out of its pacifist nature and take a proactive stance in contributing to the security of the Pacific region.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>The character of the People or a Race will seldom change.<br><br>It is in the genes.<br><br>The Germans will remain an aggressive, technocratic race; systematic in all that they do; relentlessly perfectionist to the end. There remain neo-fascist worshippers with little guise in embracing Nazism.<br><br>The Japanese has remained a homogeneous race, abhorrent to the idea of absorbing other races into their society, or even entering into marital relationships with peoples that they deem of Â“lesser racial status than themselvesÂ”.<br><br>Like the Germans, the Japanese people have it in their genetic make-up to be industrious, determined and inventive to overcome the odds that nature stack up against them.<br><br>The Japanese are ruthlessly efficient, dedicated to the success of the group; systematically efficient and perfectionist in the performance of all tasks.<br><br>Both come from societies that embrace military like discipline in almost all spheres of human activities Â– social, economic, educational and cultural.<br><br>Historically, both cultures respect authoritarianism, power, and physical strength and endurance.<br><br>While the Germans are largely aware and continuously educated to the open knowledge of the events of WW2, the concentration camps, and gas chambers; it is quixotically surprising that Japan continue to deny its own actions and role in WW2.<br><br>The Japanese Government has gone to the extent of changing the contents of history text books for its school children, denying its own role in WW2 - let alone mentioning the existence of its role in large scale massacres in China and throughout Asia, or the existence of Military Chemical Experimentation Camps in Northern China that made tests with the lives of Chinese and Korean prisoners of war and civilians Â– the lives of these races whom they deem to be worth less then animals.<br><br>The Germans, as a nation, are warily conscious of any attempts by its Government to expand the role of its Armed Forces as Peace Keepers in foreign countries Â– even on UN sanctioned roles. They remain wary and conscious of the Military Budget that its Government plan for any expansion.<br><br>Surprisingly, without similar exposure and public awareness of the role that Japan played during WW2, with the exception of some Japanese Pacifists, the larger majority of Japanese Citizens remain oblivious to the significance of the development of the Japanese Military and any foreign excursions that its Military assume overseas.<br><br>Why should Japan need an aircraft carrier, even it is to defend itself against North Korea?<br><br>Is Japan so far away that is cannot project its air force to hit targets in North Korea?<br><br>Until Japan acknowledge its role, stop changing the historical facts of events that had happened in WW2, and educate its Citizens to the events of WW2 Â– even without making any Public Apology (just to meet them half-way and allow them to save face) Â– then, and only then can we trust Japan with further development of its Armed Forces.<br><br>A leopard never changes its spots.<br><br>The Zebra will always have its stripes.<br><br>Wake up people, let not history repeat itself.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I believe that contributions of cash in building bridges, etc, can be viewed from other angles, such as one of sympathy.<br><br>All the rest of the world, especially nations in the pacific, want is an official apology from the Japanese government in resorting to violence.<br><br>Yes I agree, that the Japanese were treated unfairly after world war 2, and the US, as some Japanee (surprise,surprise) historians put it, literally FORCED japan into the war by unfair treaties and cutting off trade after her invasion of places like Shanghai.  But if we look at it from a macro scale, I believe the japanese have more than repaid any unfair US actions against them and definitely more than proven the rest of the world that they are as capable warriors as any other.<br><br>That the US napalmed Tokyo, and nuked Nagasaki and Hiroshima has to be viewed from another angle.  Consider what would have happened if the US had not resorted to napalms and nukes.  Bear in mind that the Japanese leaders were already distributing weapons to the civilian population.  Also, civilian Japanese living on pacific islands used by the US in their island hopping campaign threw their children, and then themselves into the sea to avoid being taken prisoner by the Marines shows the determination of the Japanese to carry on fighitng at all cost.<br><br>A blood bath would have resulted when the Allies invaded Japan mainland had the US not resorted to nuking and firebombing.<br><br>I think that war would have continued if not for the bombing of the above mentioned cities.<br><br>And yes, the Japanese are proud people and that they have their pride which makes it difficult for them to apologise.  However, this is NOT a sufficiently strong reason for the Japanese not to apologise.<br><br>That the Japanese have not been pressed by its more important partners, such as the US, does not mean that it should not apologise.  By ignoring the angry countries closer to itself, is it not also treating these countries with an air of superiority and indifference? Similar to the attitude Japanese suffered from before WW2?<br><br>How can Japan and its supporters continue to ignore the angry Korean and Chinese peoples?  And how can Japan, even before issuing an official apology for its grievious crimes, think of abandoning its pacifist policy?<br><br>my two cents</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I concur with laser.  An apology implies guilt, which Japan has singularly failed to admit, and therein lies the problem.  As has been stated in previous posts, Japan's stance was that she was simply protecting her own interests.  Since that stance has never changed, it leaves open the possibility of Japan starting another war should they perceive similar circumstances to arise.<br><br>Most of the Germans that I have dealt with tend to turn a shade pale when something even peripherally related to World War 2 is mentioned, seemingly having developed an allergy to the idea of war.  The Japanese, on the other hand, are not so much in denial as unaware of the circumstances and implications - that makes for a particularly dangerous situation.<br><br>Macross, do you seriously want this to happen again?<br><br><img src="http://www.peacewire.org/photoexhibits/Hiroshima/images/lg12.GIF"><br><br>Apologies to the posters for the rude photograph, but it is only slightly less repugnant than the unthinking, callous attitude that prompted it.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I think the nukes on Nagasaki and Hiroshima were justified. It remains a debatable topic though.The world was facing an impending and imminent threat from japan and the axis of evil. They have swept through most of South East Asia. It would be a threat to US interests since US bases were in the Phillippines and South Pacific.<br><br>In the war, bu shi ni si jiu shi wo wang. Whoever dies loses and whoever survives is victorious. The worst thing that can happen is US falling under Japan's rule and probably all the americans are wearing kimonos ,watching japanese drama and speaking Jap now. It did not turn out that way, partly because of the atomic bombs. For your info, the nukes now they've developed have the potential to be 700 times more powerful than those dropped in the famous Hiroshima.<br><br>We cannot limit of minds to what these government figures are thinking. For all you know, they might be taking advantage of the world situation to advance their own interests. The press is only a facade of things unseen.<br><br>In the midst of the US- North Korean nuke negotiations, US-Iran nuke negotiations, the recent Iraq war downgrading into a guerilla battle, the Middle East pandemonium between Israel and Palestinians and the terror group Hamas, the world's war on terror etc etc. US is currently so busy dealing with all these problems and Japan's development of the carriers will probably not get much attention from US at all.<br><br>They really have no need for carriers. Purpose of carriers is act as a deterrent to any budding conflict and to launch long range attacks. I don't think it is applicable to using them on North Korea since they are only a stone's throw away from each other. Whatever it is.
