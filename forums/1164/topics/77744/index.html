Several sources, close to the author, have stated seeing the F-19A during operations over Kosovo and recently in OPERATION IRAQI FREEDOM.  Air Force officials do admit that Specter One is still in service and is only used when absolutely necessary. There is some talk as to producing ten more F-19Â’s with updated 21st Century technology and carrying the F-19C designation.

            <div class='col-md body'>haha i've read the whole thing and i would like to make some truth out of the crap they wrote haha ok here i go<br><br><blockquote>Almost one year to the day, July 1987, Congress announced that the F-19 Specter was to be cancelled.  On an interesting note, Lockheed already had a stealth aircraft, the F-117 Nighthawk, flying at the Tonopah Test Range, Nevada. But since both aircraft teams were sworn to secrecy, neither knew of each otherÂ’s existence</blockquote>This program is called the B2 stealth bomber...which was being worked at the same time by Northtorp...the only other stealth program.it was not cancelled but buried deeper since it was not found out<br><br><blockquote>Specter Five was destroyed in a training accident in 1985 when the primary flight control hydraulic pump failed in flight. The pilot ejected safely</blockquote>This happened to the HB 1002 aka the 2nd prototype interestingly enough<br><br><blockquote>Specter Six was also destroyed in a training accident in 1986 when pilot, Capt. Dirk Â“SquarejawÂ” Pottenger over stressed the airframe in a 15g turn and catastrophic airframe damage occurred. Luckily, Squarejaw did eject safely and now in the Guinness Book of World Records as the only human to survive a 15g ejection from an aircraft.</blockquote>HB1001 aka the 1st prototype was lost when the land gear got stuck...pilot bailed out...was knocked unconscious in the process....<br><br><blockquote>Specter Two was stripped of it components and was towed to the flight line fire pit for fire training and of last report was completely destroyed after one fire exercise due to the carbon fiber make up of the aircraft.</blockquote>the prototype for the 1st production plane crashed right after take off.....due to some ass plugging the computer wires wrongly..the plane yawed instead of pitching....<br><br>1 F117 was lost in a crash in a hill.... so there....<img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz"><br></div>
