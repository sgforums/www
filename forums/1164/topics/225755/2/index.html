            <div class='col-md body'>The Aussies likely have to be worried about maintaining regional air superiority.<br><br>If the Super Bug will do the trick for them in the meantime is another question, but they are certainly moving to check the Indonesian Flankers that's for sure. The yanks are not going to part with Raptor technology anytime soon (unlikely sell) and the only thing that's going to be doing dogfighting in the Aussie air force in the future would be the JSF...<br><br>Hence getting the Super Bug to supplement their air fighting capabilities is not a totally bad idea.<br><br>As with everything in their armed forces, getting anything is highly political. Singapore has recently spurged a lot on upgrading to higher block F-16s and F-15SGs... when there is a high chance we are getting the JSF soon in the future as well. I don't think the Aussies are alone in having the idea that waiting for the JSF egg to hatch is the best thing to do for your air force.<br><br>So why so harsh on them unless you want to join one of their politial parties and lobby for their cause? Personally I think it benefits us Singaporeans that the Aussies are flying Super Bugs in the meantime to balance out any muscle flexing the touchy Indo govt. might try with their Flankers.<br><br>Waiting till the JSF comes? That might be too long from now... and the Raptor might never be sold until the Yanks come up with something better... and that's going to be a while.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Their money mah, why we care so much? If they spend it wisely is another thing, but the need is certainly there and they have the wit to see it.<br><br>It is the those very things <span style="font-style: italic;">different</span> about the Super Bug that make it far deadiler in air to air combat, given most engagements in air to air now take place BVR in an EW environment. The orginal Hornet was designed to survive in a very different environment, and is getting long in the tooth. There's only so much you can upgrade.<br><br>The radar, EW suit and engines of the Super Bug go a long way towards modern survivability and air superiority... any way you look at it, the aussies either have the option to stick with their older Hornet airframes (which is hardly ideal) or switch to something newer.<br><br>If anything, getting the Super Bug is probably the <span style="font-style: italic;">least</span> costly of all their upgrading options as opposed to taking no action. Unless they want to stick with their old Hornets and wait for the JSF egg to hatch (anyway the JSF was not intended to be a serious dogfighter), or hope the Yanks one day decide to sell the F-22 (which is very unlikely given the DOD has clamped down on it)... they are stuck with their aging Hornets in an age where regional powers are getting more modern planes. Switching to another type of airframe altogether will be a total loss.<br><br>This is not to mention that they have plans for the Super Bug to step into the F-111 shoes as well... so how exactly are they being silly about the way they spend their cash on the Bug? A lot of the talk is politics that you unfortunately latched onto without proper thought.<br><br>So how different is their situtation from us? Except that there are politicans around to make noise when money is spent. We had aircraft getting long in the tooth and sought to replace or improve them as well... the Aussies have the same thing to consider.<br><br>Case in point, our most advanced Falcons don't offer that much improvement in air to air combat manuvering over the first few models we have, HOWEVER... it would be fool hardly to say that in overall air to air combat there is no difference... our current Falcons are a lot deadiler then the first variants.<br><br>The only this is that the Aussies were sway that they got an aircraft type that was shared less commonality within the improved variants, while our Falcons were easy to switch between. But their only fault was that they were not psychic. Also the Aussies lack the know how to readily upgrade their airframes the way we do, so that option is more of less closed to them.<br><br>The current haggle there is not over if costs are jumping or not (costs will jump or fall when it comes to defence spending like this)... it's if they should be spending the cash to begin with.<br><br>And rightly, we have no say in this matter. To state a point they are debating (cost increase) as a demostration of defective aussie management is absurb... I don't think we can do any better given the same situtation.</div>

Also you have to account for politics while flitering out what you want to hear. Basically it is an issue of to get new planes or not and not really if this or that costs 6 billion or what have you not which lionnoisy should really pack his bags and take his crusade elsewhere.<br><br>I suppose the advantage the Super Bug has is that it is a relatively new airframe compared to the Strike Eagle, which has been around for a while.

The JSF is not exactly your ideal aircraft for dogfighting (but it's stealth is a good feature) and is still some time off, while the Yanks are not going to sell the Raptor until they have something better.</div>

It is written by Andrew Davies, ASPI's Operations and Capability Program Director.<br><br><blockquote>...The rationale for the JSF decision was the need to move to a fifth generation aircraft in order to have a superior capability to the high-end fourth generation threats we were likely to encounter from 2015 on. But the Super Hornet is not even the best fourth generation option.<br><br>Other than the US Navy (who had the aircraft designed specifically to operate off aircraft carriers), no one has opted to buy it so far, despite serious marketing efforts. Plusses include a powerful radar, good networking abilities and stealth design features not available when the classic Hornet was designed (though the latter will be of little benefit when non-stealthy external strike weapons are carried).<br><br>On the downside, its design for operations from aircraft carriers means that it has structural strengthening in the undercarriage and other parts that lead to extra weight, and a wing design optimised for low rather than high speeds. It is therefore behind the performance curve from the beginning when compared to land-based aircraft.<br><br>Other nations shopping for Western fourth generation aircraft have selected designs like the European Typhoon or the American F-15. Buyers of the latter include South Korea, Singapore and Israel - all canny purchasers of military hardware.<br><br>Many nations around the Indian and Pacific Ocean rims have opted for Russian designs like the formidable Sukhoi Su-27/30 Flanker family of fighter aircraft. Large, agile, fitted with a powerful radar and heavily armed, these aircraft present a significant challenge to Western fourth generation fighters.<br><br>By far the best placed fourth-generation aircraft to counter them is the F-15. Critically, the performance of the Super Hornet means that it cannot realistically be expected to defeat well-flown Flankers in combat.....</blockquote>--<br>http://www.aspi.org.au/publications/publication_details.aspx?ContentID=115<br><br>2<strong>.Very interesting comments/feedback on the link above:</strong><br><br>Andrew Davies   	 Thursday, 8 March 2007 1:41 PM<br>Response to AGRA<br><blockquote>Your comment about Korea and Singapore is extraordinary. Both have very robust selection processes for their military equipment. To suggest that they were convinced to buy an aircraft (F15)that was second best in order to boost BoeingÂ’s bottom line is to do them a great disservice. Before Singapore made its decision many commentators saw it as a good litmus test of the world market.<br><br>As you say, range and payload considerations are indeed critical for strike missions, but survivability must play a major role as well. The kinematic performance of the F-15 is better than the Super Hornet in all important parameters, giving it a clear edge in air to air encounters with members of the Flanker family. I had discussions with current fighter pilots who confirmed this assessment which, together with consideration of the capability of the long-burn Russian BVR missiles, provided the basis for my statement that the Super Hornet Â‘cannot be expected to defeat a well-flown FlankerÂ’.<br><br>The sensor and networking fit of the Super Hornet is very good, as you suggest. I have said as much in media interviews and, indeed, wrote:<br><br>Â“Plusses include a powerful radar, good networking abilities and stealth design features not available when the classic Hornet was designed (though the latter will be of little benefit when non-stealthy external strike weapons are carried)Â”.<br><br>The range issues you raise are true enough, especially in the context of coalition operations. However, they carry much less weight in defence of Australia roles. Draw some circles on maps and it becomes clear that any forward positioning of our strike aircraft would bring air to air refuelling aircraft uncomfortably close to the range of Flanker family adversaries.<br><br>As a general comment, there seems to have been a covert effort on both sides of the Super Hornet versus F-22 debate to tacitly argue about mission profiles that suit the aircraft being discussed. The Super Hornet corner is thinking in terms of strike packages in a coalition context, where it is well-suited. The Â‘must have the F-22 at all costsÂ’ crowd (of which I am not one) frame their arguments in terms of air to air. In fact, I think we need both capabilities in some measure. That is why, incidentally, commentators like Stratfor came down on the side of the F-15. </blockquote></div>
