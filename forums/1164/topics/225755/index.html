However I don't think there is any likelihood of that having to be before us and we have full confidence of the program delivering the JSF on time," he said.<br><br>Print Friendly Version  Email this story<br><br></div>

Most probably will get more F-16C/Ds when the JSF is further delayed<br>Maybe get 2nd hand from the US or some other Nato country, then upgrade by ourselves. This is assuming we have the capability to upgrade the F-16C/Ds by then which is quite feasible.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"></div>

While slightly larger than Australia's Hornets, the Super Hornet's agility, supersonic speed and acceleration performance, critical in air combat, <strong>are no better than the earlier model, </strong>due to a Congressional mandate during development. With unique engines, radar, airframe and electronic warfare systems, the Super Hornet shares little real commonality with its predecessor, driving up support costs. All it offers is a better radar, improved avionics and 36 per cent more internal fuel, at a price tag estimated at $2.5 billion.<br><br>The bad news is that the Super Hornet is not competitive against the latest Russian Sukhoi Su-30MK fighters, operated or being acquired by China, India, Malaysia, Thailand and Indonesia, and it is also not competitive against the Boeing F-15 models being acquired by Singapore, South Korea, and flown by Japan.<br><br>The larger Sukhois are faster, much more agile, and have greater range and firepower than the Super Hornet. The Russians are now testing an advanced supersonic cruise engine in the Sukhoi fighter, which will effectively double the combat speed of the Russian fighters, putting them well out of reach of the lacklustre Super Hornet.<br><br>The Super Hornet is not a credible air combat fighter in this region, and no upgrade can ever make it so.<br><br>The stated intention to use the Super Hornet as an interim replacement for Australia's F-111s is no less incredible.<br><br>Capable of carrying about half the F-111's payload of smart bombs to about two-thirds the distance achievable by the F-111, in raw firepower terms the Super Hornet delivers around one-third the punch of the F-111.<br><br>To match the range and persistence of the F-111, the Super Hornet must be supported by aerial refuelling tanker aircraft in numbers that Defence has no intention of ever acquiring. <strong>In real terms, replacing F-111s with Super Hornets reduces strike capability three-fold.</strong><br><br>Claims by Defence that the F-111s will become dangerous to fly after 2010 are absurd, given the advanced testing used to verify structural integrity of the fleet. Defence has repeatedly inflated the cost of operating and upgrading the F-111 in evidence to Parliament, and made factually incorrect claims on a wide range of technical issues, while publicly admitting "we don't know what we don't know". <strong>In short, the Defence leadership has no credibility whatsoever in justifying the early retirement of the F-111s.</strong> Even a fraction of the budget required to buy the Super Hornet would equip the F-111s with new engines, new wings and new avionics, allowing them to remain in use decades longer.<br><br>Compared to the mediocre Joint Strike Fighter that Defence intends as the ultimate replacement for both the F/A-18A and F-111 fleets, the Super Hornet has inferior stealth and avionics. Neither of these aircraft were designed to be credible in air combat against the latest Russian Sukhois.<br><br>Nor were they designed to defeat the advanced Russian S-300 and S-400 surface-to-air missile systems, largely superior to the US Patriot, and now appearing in this region.<br><br>In strategic terms, Defence is re-equipping the RAAF with a fleet of aircraft that will be little more than a bad joke in the region Â— and doing so despite better alternatives, such as the superlative F-22A, and despite repeated advice to the contrary.<br><br>Defence runs a real risk that as further difficulties emerge with the Joint Strike Fighter, and its cost continues to creep up, a future government will bale out, and with Super Hornets already in service, opt to buy more to replace the legacy Hornets. This further reduces capability against the non-credible Joint Strike Fighter plan. A far better strategy for the future of the RAAF is to scrap current planning, and start again.<br><br>The F-22A Raptor suffers none of the limitations of either the Joint Strike Fighter or Super Hornet, and is in production and operational in the US.<br><br>If Australia is to have any strategic credibility in the region, it cannot pursue the path sought by the Defence leadership.<br><br>Dr Carlo Kopp is a defence analyst and research fellow in regional military strategy at the Monash Asia Institute. He has flown the Super Hornet.<br><br></blockquote><img src="http://www.theage.com.au/ffximage/2006/12/29/200_op_3012.jpg"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I won't give total support to purchase F-22A eventhough my heart wants to. RAAF with F-22A would be great, but I doubt the Americans would give them the full fledge version, most likely a watered down version.<br><br>As a stop gap meaure, if replacing F111 is the real key, then getting F-15SG like planes is the most sensible. If RAAF wants a real fighter to deal with Sukhois, then they should look into Eurofighter and let the existing F-18 do the mud moving.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Almost sure Aussie will spend so much $$ without details study.<br>Thats why SG is classified as Reference Customer.<br><br>pl read my post 20.12.2006 in this thread.<br><blockquote>Dr Nelson decided to opt for the Super Hornet without a detailed study of alternative aircraft types such as the US air force's F-15 Eagle or the European Typhoon. The Super Hornet offers some commonalities with the Australian air force's existing Hornet fleet and a relatively easy conversion for air crew, air force sources say. </blockquote>2.<strong><a href="http://www.theaustralian.news.com.au/story/0,20867,21190098-31477,00.html" rel="nofollow">$4bn Hornet buy tipped to get nod, Patrick Walters, National security editor, February 08, 2007</a></strong><br><br><blockquote>A $4 BILLION deal to purchase 24 F/A-18F Super Hornet fighters from the US is expected to be approved by the Howard Government's national security committee within weeks.<br>Defence Minister Brendan Nelson is driving the acquisition amid concerns that Australia may lack a fully deployable air combat capability early next decade following the retirement of the F-111 strike force.<br><br>Defence officials are now close to finalising details of the Super Hornet deal with the Pentagon, with the new warplanes expected to enter service from 2009-10.<br><br>The Pentagon told the US Congress on Tuesday it was proposing to sell Australia 24 of the upgraded Hornets in a deal worth $US3.1 billion ($4 billion). The package includes the aircraft, 48 engines, radars, guided missile launchers and other military equipment.<br><br>A spokesman for Dr Nelson said the Government was still to decide whether to buy or lease the planes. "A decision (on the purchase) will be made soon," he said.<br><br>Dr Nelson's push for the interim fighters is driven by concerns about possible production delays in the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter destined to become Australia's front-line combat aircraft from 2014.<br><br>But the $4 billion purchase will lead to a major revision of the Defence Department's 10-year capital equipment plan, which is already facing big cost blowouts from other planned equipment buys, including the navy's air warfare destroyers.<br><br>One option for the Government will be to cut the 100-strong $14 billion joint strike fighter purchase.<br><br>The Super Hornet acquisition will enable the retirement of the F-111s in 2010 without the need for a further costly extension of their service life.<br><br>It could produce savings in the RAAF's current $1.5billion upgrade of its existing F/A-18 fleet with fewer of the aircraft needing to be overhauled.<br><br>The F/A-18F Super Hornet has better range and more sophisticated avionics than the current F-18 A/B models and has been used in combat in Iraq and Afghanistan.<br><br>It costs about $75 million for each warplane. They have a combat radius of 681 nautical miles and are equipped with the latest APG-79 radar.<br></blockquote>---http://www.theaustralian.news.com.au/story/0,20867,21190098-31477,00.html<br><br>2.Aussie is really rich.Spend S$5 billions without details comparsions.<br>They even dunt bother to do a show only RFP etc.<br><br>Pity Aussie tax payers!!</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Yeah, u have to agree that conversion from hornets to superhornets are definitely gonna be a hell lot easier.  Both are very energy efficient jets.  Great handling at low speeds.<br><br>Was hoping Aus would go for a REAL fighter jet thought.  Maybe the F-15s or even  some of the Euro canards.</div>
