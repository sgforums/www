            <div class='col-md body'>by Martin Walker<br>Dec 30, 2005<br><br>The DDP report added that Goss had delivered to the Turkish prime minister and his security aides a series of dossiers, one on the latest status of Iran's nuclear development and another containing intelligence on new links between Iran and al-Qaida.<br><br>DDP cited German security sources who added that the Turks had been assured of a warning in advance if and when the military strikes took place, and had also been given "a green light" to mount their own attacks on the bases in Iran of the PKK, (Kurdish Workers party), which Turkey sees as a separatist group responsible for terrorist attacks inside Turkey.<br><br>Goss's visit to the Turkish capital followed the rising international concern over recent statements by the new Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad that Israel should be "wiped off the map," denying the existence of Holocaust, and suggesting that Israel's Jewish population might be re-located to Europe.<br><br>In a December 23 report, the DDP agency quoted an anonymous but "high-ranking German military official" telling their reporter: "I would be very surprised if the Americans, in the mid-term, didn't take advantage of the opportunity delivered by Tehran. The Americans have to attack Iran before the country can develop nuclear weapons. After that would be too late."<br><br><a href="http://www.postchronicle.com/news/security/article_2122666.shtml" rel="nofollow">http://www.postchronicle.com/news/security/article_2122666.shtml</a></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>You know... I have been reading news from international news and have been following the event.<br><br>From the very start, Iran have been under an embargo for longer than Iraqi have. However, Iran had pretty much weathered well under such such circumstances well. It's been called an AXIS of terror longer than I can remember. So, I have the opinion that whatever Iran does or does not, it will still receive criticism, much like China gets.<br><br>Isreal viewed Iran as an enemy vice visa. Israel has been daunting US to invade Iran, with relatively same tactics used in the Iraq war... Etc. Israel has been releasing news like Iran wil have Nukes in 6 mths, search for Nukes parts, supporting terrorist in Iraqi, Iraq's WMD sent into Iran, while reporting Iraq WMD also sent to Syria. Iran sending IEDs into Iraq..... ONO<br><br>While Israel themselves has 62 UN resolutions against her, of which, 32 are for occupying foreign land. much more the Saddam. Israel has also 250 Nukes. The only one in ME that has WMD.<br><br>With Syria leadership being accuse of killing lebanese Hariri, base on a UN report that has no concrete evidence and mostly of accusations, while even the lead witness has admitted being brided..  We can see the whole picture of what is to become of it.<br><br>Israel has said that IRAN deadline is March. The Israel election is in March, Iran will start to except EUROS for oil trade also march. In March US soldiers are also still in Iraq, In the middle of it. Isreal will need to fly thru Syria or Iraq to strike Iran, Thus dragging The US in. You see the US are already stretched thin in Iraq and could not invade Iran, If the wanted to (Home sentiments). By trapping them, they are forced into the conflict, while Israel is protected by the US ( Canon fodder) in Iraq. Hoping that it would not be just limited to air strikes.<br><br>With Syria and Iran down, Saudi , Turkey and Jordan under US Fold. All enemies are eliminated. With plenty of OIL to go around.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Woah, hold on Moby.<br><br>I must have missed something lately while studying for my tests.

As for the WMD part, most western source fail to inform us that it would take decades, if that's their intention.<br><br>On the US providing evidence of Iran Nuclear weapons embition, well, it was again based on the same kind of evidence produced on Iraqi. It was based on a stolen Iranian Laptop, showing very unprofessional presentation and documents even a high school kid could reproduced.

And most of the reports originated from Israel.<br><br>I don't blame Iran on the Nuclear ambotion at all. Remember Iraq, many people have the opinion that IF the US point the nuclear finger at you, You better gets some nuke fast... because It doesn't matter you have it or not. Their intentions are clear. BTW, I do some how admire Iran, under embargo and they are still so resilient. But their President is really brain cooked - insane.</div>
