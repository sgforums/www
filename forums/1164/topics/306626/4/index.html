              <p>Last I checked nuclear warfare isn't really on the decks in this
              region, so what's with this "one bomb" thing except to
              demostrate a lack of actual proper knowledge.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Firstly if we do not have a credible military, we will have a
              lot less cards on the deck when dealing with other things that
              don't have much to do with the military at all. You can forget
              about Malaysia playing nice in the water deals, they can simply cut
              or uncut the tap as and when they please because they know that you
              don't really have any way to stop them from doing so.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>You can forget about people bothering to go to international
              court to settle stuff about whoes rock belongs to who. They'll just
              plant their flag there and we'll suck thumb and whine.</p>

              <p>Guys,</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Be careful wat you wished for...</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The only way to toughen up a military unit is to put it through an acid test of real combat. Now, if you look around the world, nowadays, where are the hot spots...? Iraq? Afghanistan? The War on Terror is real and SAF has been slowly but surely participated, via small contributions like medical teams, air refuelling etc. on the side of Uncle Sam. Now what is stopping Uncle from asking SAF to contribute more in terms of "boots on the ground"..??</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>If you have followed other military forums on the web etc...NATO "boots on the ground" contributors in Afghan is already stretched thin. They are currently pressing Germany to increase more troops to fight in the S. Afghan. Already 700 extra French troops are going to Afghan. So my point is, be prepared to see real combat in Afghan in the near future.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Good Luck!! </p>

              <p><br>Thats why all armies nowadays use operant conditioning to train their soldiers. The book by US Lt. Col. Dave Grossman "On Killing" is a pretty good resource. Every time someone goes for range they are being trained to shoot and kill the enemy without the feelings of guilt and remorse.</p>

              <p>The thing about the SAF is this. We are trying to make the first strike instead of the enemy.</p>
              <p>We are not going to let the enemy hit us first before we attack. We are going to attack when they are not even looking at us.  Some people can do this, some people can't.</p>
              <p>When an army is make up of volunteers, it is much easier for people to make the first move. Or when you are living in a generation when people have to be physically tougher.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>With the current generation, some people are not meant to be a soldier in the first place. There is no motivation to do so. The reason why US invade Iraq for the second time is mainly due to the US population wanting more and more blood after 911.</p>
              <p>The same as world war 2, after what Japan did to USA. Singapore isn't going to fight a war anytime soon, nor are we really pissing anyone off enough for a war to start.</p>
              <p>Simply, forcing the current generation into a soldier mindset is hard. Forcing them to become trained killers in even harder.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The older generation might be able to actually kill for their defense, espically during the early years of singapore, with so much chaos and etc.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The majority of a peaceful generation is not meant to be a soldier. Marching drills, excerise and learning to use a gun does not make one a soldier. The ability to take all of them, with the urge to kill the enemy without mercy makes one a soldier.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>NS is basically a deterence force now. Don't force military training into people who hated the idea of being a soldier. If so, the motivation of those people to train will be very low, and it may damage their loyalty to the country. A person who hated NS will view this as the government trying to enslave the people.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Most of the overseas singaporeans, who are not members in this forums, said that the reason why the migrated to due to the government's actions and etc. NS is one of the few reasons.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I don't think we should 'toughen' them up. Trying to 'toughen' them up can make quite a number of people to hate NS even more.</p>

              <p>What's the matter with you? You're not man enough to spend 2 years protecting your homeland like the rest of your predecessors. You meant to say it was safe for the last 40 years so what the hell it should be safe in the future? Where have you been hidding all this time? under a rock in Bukit Timah Hill?</p>
              <p>Let me tell you, if not for the dedication and sacrifice of those p<span style="color: black; font-family: Arial;">redecessors</span>, those pass generations of young men who did their NS, it wouldn't be this peaceful and safe as you would be enjoying right now. If you have not been so ignorant of the "situations" our country had gone through you would probably be more appreciative our arm forces. And that it is the pride and honour for every mother's father's son to serve.</p>

              <p>Continue from above.  Hit "saved" accidentally.</p>
              <p>I quote ray245: "Don't force military training into people who hated the idea of being a soldier." ..."motivation of those people to train will be very low, and it may damage their loyalty to the country."</p>
              <p>We need a sizeable and credible citizen armed forces to defend our sovereign right.  In order to have a credible deterence, we need well-trained soldiers. How else can you produce respected effective soldiers if the training is not tough.  Oh, I get it. Buy expensive weapons to deter? :) Parade these "white elephants" to the public and journalists regularly every year to deter potential aggressor.  Please don't turn a blind eye to the price for peace.  Our effective citizen soldiers have reaped peace dividends many-fold over for our continued existence as a nation in this volatile region. My respect to the motivated soldiers in SAF, past, present and future. </p>
              <p>In any case, military training may be tough but there are plenty of breaks in-between to rest the soul and body.  If it can't break you, it will only make you stronger mentally.  Yep, the regimentation may kill some brain-cells.  But you are saddle with "chores" in civilian life as well.  Some tasks at work, home, ... are not always interesting but need to be executed nevertheless. We don't have a choice in everything.  Teach me how to escape from such "chores" then? delegate, sub-contract, off-shoring,...? At some point the buck has to stop.  Not in your lap?</p>
              <p>Much as we pride ourselves on having a strong forward thinking armed forces that is improving it's capabilities everyday, we don't train professional killers.  No respectable armed forces do that.  Watch "Letters from Iwo Jima".  Even the hated Imperial Japanese Army could not turn every soldiers into a brain-less killing machine.  The training has become so civilized and scientific now compared to my NSF period.  Almost all training are outcome-based.  Any task which are not value-adding to the outcome are discarded. </p>
              <p>I just don't understand what's so wrong about being a soldier, a citizen soldier at that.  It's role play, role play and role play.  In fact, you can complete a part-time study course during the NSF period if you so wish.  Nobody is asking you to kill, for now.  When the time come upon us, we will decide.  Until then, just do your part as a show of force so that your degree of loyalty is not at doubt.</p>
