              <p>Yet children still have to eat their vegetables, teenagers still have
              to do their homework, adults still have to work jobs they don't like.
              The point is, in life, there are things that you don't like yet still have to do! Take the Israelis for example. I have been there to visit friends, and none of them like the military. Yet they still serve, because every other day a rocket lands near them, or in their town. We are fortunate enough that 1) Our neighbours are not as hostile 2) Our military response has deterred most agressive actions before the population hears of them. But because of this hardly anyone realises the threats that we have faced and are facing. If you think that we live in a nice and pleasant world, then please go read some newspapers. Even now we have threats to our national sovereignty, even if they are not as blatant as in the 80s and 90s.</p>
              <p>Yes, some people will rebel when they refuse to see the reason why they need to serve, but when their families are killed or raped, it would be too late to turn back the clock. That is why we make them serve despite their attitudes.</p>

              <p>Guys. Rooki is a M'sian fat sow who comes to Singapore forum to slam Singapore men and Singapore's decisons. She also claims that M'sia is crime-free, which probably makes her the funniest M'sian that ever lived.</p>
              <p>Her agenda against NS stems from her citizenship, because Singapore's NS is the biggest thorn in M'sia's side.</p>
              <p>Please go to the SAF forum of sgforums to read some of the things she's said about Singapore as a country and Singapore men. She also says that "Singapore men cannot ever hold a handle to foreign men", it's so sad I wonder what is she doing here cannot find poontang, in a place with inferior men, is it because her backwater pays her s*** salary?</p>
              <p>Wonder if we can find a M'sia who's more no-life than this one, who spends her time storming Singapore forums in cyberspace to slam Singapore, its policies, its government and its men..kena rejected too many times here by men after sorrowfully leaving her hometown to work here to support her family of 12 back home in the sweat shop factory</p>

From an IPPT failed 3 pointer to SISPEC IPPT silver. Like so many of you I’ve put metal onto targets, learnt various infantry small arms, fired antitank weapons, blown things to kingdom come with explosives, learnt to fight and survive in varied environments from the jungle to the urban sprawl, rode and trained to rappel from helicopters, met the people who taught me close combat that eventually led me on the path learning Brazillain Jui-Jitsu and Mixed Martial Arts so that I can defend myself and my loved ones even as a civilian, and also learning to look out for the man next to you and trusting him with your life as well as he trusting you with his.</span></p>

Yes some of the policies about it needs to be changed to give our guys a leg up in the civvies world in Singapore, but I think the position that NS is NOT for our guys is a ludicrous position. Complain the soldier will, but he can’t deny at the end of the day he was a tougher person at the end of it.</span></p>

You can change this, however, by not swallowing everything the almighty government tells you to, including the lie that NS is 'good'.<br><br>Yeah, yeah.</strong></span><br><br><strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">Look, Singapore would never have needed such a wasteful armed forces if its leaders had shut up, put up, and stayed with Malaysia. National pride versus 2(3?) generations of males having their brains fried by NS? A bumi policy -untenable anyway- versus constant paranoia towards neighbours, having no support whatsoever?</span><br><br><span style="color: #ff0000;">Sometimes I really pity you men. Being used as pawns by the rulers while having your language faculties and other parts of your brain slowly wrecked by NS. And then wondering why the government doesn't give you rights commensurate with foreigners.<br><br>My, my. Can't really blame the SPGs, if you're an example of the quinessential Singaporean male.</span><br><br>I wonder who's the fool here, if you can't even interpret that the untenability i mentioned was in reference to the bumi policy. You think Malaysia would continue bumi for long with a vastly reduced Malay majority?<br><span style="color: #ff0000;"><br>Paragraph 3 shows just how much PAP kool-aid you've imbibed. Obviously Singapore has no carjackings, robberies, burglaries, and rapes of your wives. If women want a parrot, they'd get a macaw bird.</span><br></strong><br>Thanks for making my point for me that " Countries that did not separate from a larger country that they could be depending on now, ... can pretty much execise their "freedom" and pursue their agendas for their betterment," <span style="color: #ff0000;">If Singapore and Malaysia were one, no doubt it would be much more powerful than either country now. </span>Also, NK and Pakistan aren't exactly in very rosy situations despite "standing their grounds against world pressure to disarm for humanitarian objectives". There's a reason why there are sanctions and boycotts against them.<br><br>Wow, what a tirade you've made against SPGs and foreigners. No need to mask that with your knowledge that they are 'necessary', your insecurity shows through obviously enough. Improve yourself and refrain from calling women who are beyond you 'chattel', and perhaps you'd get more poontang and stop being so bitter.</p></div>

              <p>Hear hear! Rooki, the M'sian sow says that Singapore's leaders hould have "shut up, and put up and stayed with M'sia". HAHAHHAHAHHAAH Yi Xiang Qing Yuan! One-sided  psychotic love and envy while S'poreans todays are so blitely proud and happy that we separated and today we look at M'sians mostly as what's said in the post above? Hahah!!! An example of a pathetic person!!!!!</p>
              <p>Who wants "support" from wherever? This M'sia sow thinks that S'pore is very hard up or desperate for the "support" of M'sia. It appears that she is the one who is desperate and hard-up for S'pore's affections, and when confronted with the brutal truth that S'poreans think she's an idiot, she goes on the offensive and launches an attack on Singaporeans online and says Singaporeans cannot hold a handle to "foreign men". I wonder how many Bangladashi foreign workers have bedded her while she's working here?</p>

              <p>She could speak at speaker's corner to tell us all how Msia is crime-free and the crime situation is just like Singapore's.
