              <p><br> There is no difference in Job opportunities if your entire age
              group does the same 2 year NS. It has been on going since 1968.
              What kind of "Kuniang" excuse was that?</p>
              <p>You couldn't possibly say you get screwed out of job
              opportunities if your peers other then females are doing the
              same thing and ORD at the same time with you and joining the job
              market about the same time.</p>
              <p>What's the matter with you? You're not man enough to spend 2
              years protecting your homeland like the rest of your predecessors.
              You meant to say it was safe for the last 40 years so what the hell
              it should be safe in the future? Where have you been hidding all
              this time? under a rock in Bukit Timah Hill?</p>
              <p>Let me tell you, if not for the dedication and sacrifice of
              those p<span style="font-family: Arial; color: black;">redecessors</span>, those pass
              generations of young men who did their NS, it wouldn't be this
              peaceful and safe as you would be enjoying right now. If you have
              not been so ignorant of the "situations" our country had gone
              through you would probably be more appreciative our arm
              forces. And that it is the pride and honour for every mother's
              father's son to serve.</p>
              <p>Damn sometimes I'm so sad that there are so many defeatist and
              cowardly males in our country.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Before enlistment, i did have a positive mindset . I did have a interest in warfare n weaponry.   Wow i am able to learn how use a rifle, grenade , learn soldering skills, how bad can it be? I went in with a positive mindset.</p>
              <p>After BMT, i was posted to be a medic. Damn i was thinking, i wont be able to deal with weaponry anymore but still i tell myself hey at least i am able to save ppl on battlefield how bad can it be.</p>
              <p>After my medic course, posted to a unit my whole mindset changed. Instead of being  trained  doing wad a medic should do in a battlefield, i  spent most of  my time preparing for audits,doing stores,  doing useless, meaningless medical covers, preparing for big shot events n wadever. Worse of all working with incompetent, unmotivated regulars who is absent regularly and leaving piles of shits for us to clear up.</p>
              <p>I have had enough. I am doing stuff that doesnt contribut to national defence, More like covering up regulars, being wayang on big shot events, doing stuff that  doesnt belong to a medic's role. I wasted 2 yrs while my peers are happliy working or studying in Uni. Screw NS.</p>
              <p>Want us to be trained as professional soldiers n to be ready for wadever that may come up , train and wake  up the regulars 1st,  make sure they are role models, make sure they do their job with pride n responsibility, make sure they earn our respect, They are paid to sign on to be train as a soldier and to  lead soldiers. So until the regulars are able to do that, dont expect us to serve our 2 yrs with pride n purpose. N once again screw NS, few more mths i would be back into my normal life.</p>
