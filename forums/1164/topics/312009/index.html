              <p>Our standards are low. OTOH, we test for a lot of nonsense so soldiers from other countries might fail out IPPT, at least on the first few attempts.</p>

              <p>But ultimately, these are just physical fitness. Combat fitness requires a different mindset. We have SOC, I'm sure these other armies have similar ones that might be tougher. Furthermore, in the case of ang mohs, their body size are on average larger and heavier... A heavy field pack will most probably affect their combat performance lesser as compared to us.</p>

              <p>I would say 1.6km in 8 mins is easier than 2.4km in 12 mins. So the minimum passing rate of 2.4km in 12 mins 20 secs should be reasonably the same standard as 1.6km in 8 mins</p>
              <p>Again, US army 3.2km run in 16.36 mins to pass isn't exactly much higher than ours too. <a href="http://www.army.com/enlist/2-mile-run.html">Source</a></p>
              <p>Not to mention you only need to do 35 push ups in 2 minutes to pass and 47 sit ups in 2 minutes to graduate Basic Combat Training. SAF's timing is only 1 minute... I'm sure quite a number of SAF post-BMTers can achieve these 2 requirements in 1 minute.</p>

              <p>As I said, that is for the Airforce and that is the bare minumum required to be allowed into the airforce. They hold a selection rally periodically and choose from that group depending on the number of points achieved. And that is only for selection.</p>

              <p>In most units in SAF (which is out of basic training), unless you clock at least a silver in your IPPT, you will hv to keep re-taking. We are also considering forced conscription in Singapore vs volunteered conscription in the US.</p>
              <p>Btw, by extrapolation, 16:36 for 3.2km does not
                  equate to a 2.4km time of about 11:50. It equates to 12 minutes 27 secs if one runs at a constant speed for the whole 3.2km. Thus, &lt;12 minutes 20 secs for a pass in 2.4km is reasonable since the distance is shorter than 3.2km, and should be reasonably roughly the same difficulty as a 3.2km run.</p>
              <p>In addition, we do not consider purely running as the whole physical
                  test. You need to take into account other stations. Compare doing 35
                  push ups vs 6 chin ups, and then a shuttle run after that. Compare
                  doing 47 sit ups in 2 mins vs 25 in 1 min, then having to do a SBJ
                  after that.</p>
              <p>Lastly, 15:54 for 3.2km is roughly 11:56 for 2.4km if one runs at a constant speed. Again, the silver timing for IPPT is 11:40.</p>

              <p>I am not sure what you are on about and you seem to be very defensive - I am not sure why you are quite so upset. I did not extrapolate those figures and it would be illogical to try and extrapolate as you did for obvious reasons.</p>
              <p>As I said, those were based on personal experience. I have been building up my fitness again after a period of inacitivity and slothfulness. I currently run 2.4 and 3.2 km and regularly time myself. I found that when I was running 2.4km in 11:50, I can run 3.2km in about 16:37 and when I ran 2.4km at 11:25, I was able to run 3.2km in 15:51.</p>
              <p>I have done IPPT because I have done my NS stint. I know what it is like to do IPPT. There is very little aerobic about situps, pullups and shuttle runs. I also know what it is like in the Units, having been in an infantry unit myself. Look at it this way - you say that many units require more than the minimum standard. We can assume that foreign military units expect much the same. We should therefore eliminate unit expectations from the equation and stick to minimum acceptable standards.</p>

              <p>Do you really think personal experiences are more accurate than mathematics? When I trained 4km in 19 mins, I did 2.4km in 11:25. Both were timed too; my training was always done at a constant speed. If I were to truly take personal experience into account, 12 mins 20 seconds would be already be a tougher test. Mathematical reasonings are there for a purpose. If everyone were to take only personal experiences into account, what would the world turn into? Now you tell me which one is illogical.</p>
              <p>Also, it seems that you are only considering the aerobic part of a physical test when we are comparing the whole test. That's being extremely biased. Physical fitness does not consist of solely of aerobic exercises; it consists of anaerobic ones too. If you would wish for personal experiences, I can tell you that way before I entered army, without training, I was able to do near 30+ push ups, yet I couldn't do a single chin up. In addition, do you think 4 stations will wear you out less for your jog as compared to 2 stations? I don't think you would prefer me to go into some simple biological details here.</p>
              <p>And if we were to compare the minimum acceptable standards, let's consider only the BMT standards vs their standards of Basic Combat Training.</p>
              <p>It is not about being defensive, I'm telling you that your idea of physical fitness tests are slightly biased. Running is not all there is about physical fitness; at least that is what I can conclude from your posts because you seemed to give little regards to other static stations.</p>
