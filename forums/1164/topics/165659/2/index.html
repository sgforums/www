            <div class='col-md body'>I agree with tango on that.  Apaches generally do like to stop hover, shoot, and then scoot.  That was how they were trained to handle a potential european conflict against the Russians.  They did that pretty OK back in the first gulf war as well.  But that was because they were supporting ground troops, and thus did not suffer much casualties.<br><br>I cant say if they were playing the exact same role the 2nd time round, but I suspect they were playing more of killer/scout role rather than ground support.  I saw some videos where the apache literally hovered there for a whole 10 mins, staring at some exchange between some insurgents, before finally taking them out with their chin mounted 30mms.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Bottom line is, you can uparmour the Apache all you want, and it'll still be a vulnerable target. Apaches are tank-killers, not tanks.<br><br>Scoring an 'M' kill against a tank means that the tank can't move but can still swivel its turret around and blast you to pieces. In contrast, scoring an 'M' kill against an Apache is as good as scoring a total kill against it. An airborne helicopter with a dead engine is a dead helicopter.<br><br>After all, we've all seen what the humble RPG can do to Black Hawks in Somalia. No reason why it can't do the same to Apaches.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Yes, but the aircraft that was most involved in tank plinking was actually the F-111s and F-15Es.  The apaches weren't sent out really as killer scout packages as often as the vipers were.  The F-16s would patrol a 30 by 30 mile sectors, calling in fighter bombers to take out the tanks/artillery they spotted.<br><br>They figured that an F-111 carrying 8 500lb GBUS, would only cost them $50,000 to kill 8 tanks.  Each tank costing half a mil, it was the most cost efficient way to kill tanks. Apaches and Hellfires weren't really as "Dollar for dollar" compared to tank plinking.<br><br>Tank plinking also carried a distinct advantage for allied airpower.  They could stay above low altitude, orbit about medium altitude to destroy tanks.  That kept them out of manpads and other shoulder launched hazards.   Apaches still COULD accidentally run into some of these anti- air fire.</div>
