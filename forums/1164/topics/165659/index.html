            <div class='col-md body'>TWENTYNINE PALMS, California: The first batch of RSAF's Apache attack helicopters will take to Singapore's skies early next year.<br><br>They will make their way from the US, where the training squadron is now based.<br><br>The Apaches made their debut at an integrated SAF exercise codenamed Forging Sabre in California.<br><br>There was no doubt the Apaches were the centrepiece of the exercise.<br><br>They integrated well with the commandos, artillery, and their airforce counterparts, the UAVs and F-16s.<br><br>The Apache attack helicopters have come a long way since their purchase was announced in 1999, and should reach full operational capability in two years.<br><br>One thing's for sure -- they stole the show at the exercise in California, especially with their Hellfire missiles.<br><br>And the pilots undergoing training in the US are looking forward to showcasing the helicopter to Singaporeans.<br><br>Said Captain Ang Heng Keong, Apache pilot, RSAF Peace Vanguard Detachment, "I am feeling excited going back and flying the Apache and I guess when the aircraft takes to the skies a lot of Singaporeans will look up and say, that's the Apache. I feel glad going back with the aircraft."<br><br>The Apache is one of the most sophisticated and lethal combat helicopters in the world.<br><br>Thanks to its Longbow radar, it can pick out more than 1,000 targets, rate the 16 most dangerous ones and relay the information instantly to other Apaches through a data link.<br><br>The combat platform aside, the Apaches are also expected to add glamour to the airforce, especially for the helicopter family.<br><br>LTC Christopher Wong, Commander, RSAF Peace Vanguard Detachment, "Just like what the F-16s have done for the fighters, this time it will probably do it for the helicopter community also."<br><br>Eight helicopters are currently being used for training by the Peace Vanguard detachment in Marana, Arizona.<br><br>Another 12 Apaches are due to be delivered next year, bringing Singapore's total Apache strength to 20. - CNA /ct<br><br><a href="http://www.channelnewsasia.com/stories/singaporelocalnews/view/180580/1/.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.channelnewsasia.com/stories/singaporelocalnews/view/180580/1/.html</a></div>

I trust Mr Soh, on his return from the Mojave Desert exercise area, will elaborate on this defining moment in a commentary that fills the gaps in his understandably 'action-oriented' news report.<br><br>Among the gaps:<br><br>The push and pull factors that have led the SAF to pursue transformation, sometimes called the 'Revolution in Military Affairs'<br><br>The significance of this, especially given that in the Asia-Pacific for some time to come, only the United States, Japan, Australia and Singapore will be thus capable - and even then, within a spectrum of capabilities with the US the most highly capable<br><br>The likelihood, contrary to what some critics may say, that such a 'coalition of the technologically willing' will be a force for stability in the Asia-Pacific<br><br><strong>Finally, the caveat that the exercise just concluded is, for the good reason of testing networking among various high-tech elements, unrealistic in that the 'enemy' (apparently a non-3G armoured unit unsupported by other elements) was a lamb led to slaughter!</strong><br><br>Singaporeans should be aware that if ever the full capacity of our 3G SAF is called into combat, it may face an equally 3G enemy.<br><br>Khoo How San<br><br></div>

The only Hueys left in RSAF service are 5 or 6 based in Brunei, which will be similarly decommissioned by this year's end. I hope the RSAF would buy new utility and transport helos soon, either the UH-60L Blackhawk or the NH-90TTH.<br><br>The light helos you mentioned were probably Fennec helos, which are used for training and AOP missions.

            <div class='col-md body'>I dunno, but I get the idea that some Apache Pilots think they are invincible... and stay in hover for a bit too long, resulting in an "accidental" rpg to aircraft collision, forcing the pilot to lose control of the aircraft.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Actually there's nothing wrong with the Apache armour...its the tactics employed by the U.S. Army aviators that resulted in that aerial ambush. Apparently they were using pop-up tactics like how they practiced for war in Europe, with rolling hills and forested areas for cover. This would enable them to hide, shoot and scoot. But desert terrain is generally flat like a pool table...sooo...there goes...<br><br>Marine Cobra pilots are better in that sense. They fly by the seat of their pants, never really hovering to set up a shot...maybe that's why there's less casualties among the Marine Cobra squadrons..<br><br>Funny thing abt all this is...the lessons on gunship tactics were already there..It was first developed during Vietnam. The Americans generally tend to forget things like that quickly... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"></div>
