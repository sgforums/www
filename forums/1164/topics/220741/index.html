But if there was a way out, I will let the troops under my command surrender if they want to. Something like what the Texans in the Alamo did.  It is already a highly disadvantaged situation . Whole operation is already compromised, to risk all the lives in the team will be foolish. I will let whoever wants to surrender , surrender. Personally, I will fight on because of reputation.<br><br>As regards the last man rushing in. I think he had the chance to escape, report back to HQ and possibly even lead the next force.
