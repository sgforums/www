            <div class='col-md body'>In the end it stills boils down to the quality of each side's arty core. Having fany toys does not automatically give you the upper hand, and of course, no war is won by arty alone. The MAF is only as strong as their weakest link.<br><br>Anyway, in the absence of rocket arty, tube batteries can also create their own "steel rain" bombardment. Known as Time On Target where different batteries fire their guns at different intervals to make sure that all of them land on the target at almost the same instant. Something I'm quite sure the Singapore tube batteries love to do.</div>

As you said, the tremendous instantaneous firepower that it can deliver is unsurpassed, and can cause much more casualties than the tube arty. However, for suppression purposes, the tube arty is better due to the duration of its fire, something the rocket arty lacks.<br><br>By the way, I do believe that Gary has a point. For 50km and above, the amount of ammo needed to 'service' a given target area would require much more ammo than that required for the sub-40km range, and this 'might' impose an un-necessarily heavy burden on its logistics resupply system. I was surprised that the SS-80 wasn't guided, though the SS-150 as you stated, was. The reduction in rockets needed to service a target, in my opinion, would have paid for the increase in per rocket cost.......</div>

Using the crane, hookup to the steel cable and remove the empty tubes.This must be done slow to prevent accident.Afterall it is damn big!<br><br>6. Repeat step 1-5 but in the reverse order to place the new tubes with rockets.<br><br>As you can see , the whole process should take at least 45mins to more than one hour.<br><br><span class="large"><strong><span style="color: darkred;">CHARGE!!!</span></strong></span><br><img src="http://www.amatorce.de/Mehmet.gif"><br><br></div>

Malaysia ASTROS II system may be able to deal out firepower but the seneriao where many malaysian forumers seem to keep in their demented fantasies of their MLRS being able to smite Singapore and her armed forces with impunity is prehaps not a little simplistic. As many have pointed out, the ASTROS is far from a wonder weapon.<br><br>MLRS has it's time and place. While capable of serious firepower, many other issues such as reloading, avoiding counter battery, and avoid getting blow to bits to boot. In terms of system vulnerabilities, MLRS systems are far more fragile then normal pieces. You can't just buy MLRS piecemeal and shoot a few rounds into the sea and think you have even a slightly credible rocket arty ability. If you don't have what it takes to upkeep an MLRS, and the upkeep is very heavy, all you have is a multimillion dollar one shot white elephant.</div>

This supposedly inherent design "defiency" is more deliberate and calaculated. We had created the Primus to suit our own needs as a near frontline arty support piece placing emphasis on unit protection, precision and running high mobility arty operations, to literally shoot and scoot to a whole new level and intensity.<br><br>The longer ranged battles will be handled by our older, and non SP pieces like the Fh2000. The Primus will be many, many times more useful in providing arty support to highly mobile forces.<br><br>In short any enemy has a potential nightmare arty battle to fight with Sg, they are all recieving precise fire and their attentions are split between trying to supress the Primus fire, or those from our less mobile guns.<br><br>In short, the ASTROS II was never any system to match up to the disparity between MAF and SAF arty, it will be more useful, and probably used more as a terror weapon fired in the general south (unless they have some war on Orang Utans in their own jungles) in hopes of hitting something Singaporean, military or not. Unless the MAF gets some guided rockets, the ASTROS II remains a white elephant with more terror, then tatical use.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I feel that without a very effective intelligence system, the MRLS are pretty useless. So a very good communications system is very important. Anyway there arent many pieces in service so they wont pose much of a threat. The enemy would have to first discover our force moving through the thick jungles. Then they will have to decide if its REALLY worth firing the rockets at the target. Then they would need adequate air defense at the MRLS location...<br><br>So basically... if our forces just move quickly and carefully, they shouldnt be discovered too often. Jamming communications would help delay info. transmitted to the artillery pieces. with this methods, i think troops shouldnt suffer too many casualties to MRLS fire.</div>
