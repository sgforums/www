Sorry<br><br>One thing I wanted to ask, anyone here know the term <strong>consistency of fire Bo/X = 1/100 - 1/150</strong> , it seem that the lower , the better it is. It this same thing as the Dud probability?<br><br><span class="large"><strong><span style="color: darkred;">CHARGE!!!</span></strong></span><br><img src="http://www.amatorce.de/Mehmet.gif"><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Good analysis tripwire!<br>Actually I was also looking for the data on the dispersion of submunitions of rocket system, thank for providing the link.<br><br>Actually my simplistic view Circular Error Probable (CEP) was wrong and I apologise to everyone here about it.<br><br>It is actually worst, remember the US General talk abt the probabiity of hitting a stationary tow gun at range of 21km with a pod of six rockets with a mean deviation of 50m with only 33% of success!<br><br>A US MRLS rockets has abt 644 submunitions per rocket, which mean a total 3,864 submunitions yet only 33% chance!!!<br>That is becos my understanding of the term CEP is wrong.I thought that all rounds will hit within the CEP!!! <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_redface.gif" alt="Embarassed" title="Embarassed"><br><br>Below if the quote from some arty expert from another forum:<br><blockquote>Yes it is a Gaussian distribution, but instead using 'Standard Deviations' (ie almost everything will be within 3 times SD distance) military ballistics used PEs, where almost everything falls within 4 times the PE distance, with 50% falling within 1 PE.<br>Data quality for artillery is mostly very good, although there are some development firing ranges in some countries (we won't name them) where the quality control leaves something to be desired. However, real-world conditions are not necessarily as well-managed as they are on development ranges.</blockquote>Let me give example to explain, the Astros 2 let say has a CEP of 1% mean deviation at range 89km, that mean the mean error is 890m, an area of pi x 890sq =approx 2.5 sq km with probability of 50%!!!!<br><br>Based on the distribution, that is 32% chance of with deviation 2 times of the CEP( 1 CEP is actually 1 PE, probable error) that is from 890m to 1780m deviation.And abt 14% chance with deviation from 1780m to 2670m(3 times of PE) and lastly 4% chance with deviation from 2670m to 3560m!!!!<br>Below is the distribution chart:<br><img src="http://155.217.58.58/cgi-bin/atdl.dll/fm/6-40/fig3-11.gif"><br><br>To have a better understanding about arty ballistics, below is link abt the science of it, a bit "chim" but very good:<br><br><a href="http://155.217.58.58/cgi-bin/atdl.dll/fm/6-40/Ch3.htm#p7" rel="nofollow">http://155.217.58.58/cgi-bin/atdl.dll/fm/6-40/Ch3.htm#p7</a><br><br>I hope you will have a better understanding of arty ballistics.<br>With this data, if the Astros 2 is to target Woodland at range of 89km, I think there is 25% chance of hitting JB itself and the surrounding water!! <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br><span class="large"><strong><span style="color: darkred;">CHARGE!!!</span></strong></span><br><img src="http://www.amatorce.de/Mehmet.gif"><br><br></div>

As such, it is important to improve the precision of artillery fire," explained LTC Leong.<br><br>"Precision firing is one of the cornerstones in Army Transformation."</blockquote>Therefore I am not surprise at all that the SAF has already acquired laser guided or even GPS guided arty shells, as the matter of fact, based on the article below where they keep on talking abt "precision", some form of guidance must be available for our arty units.<br><blockquote>COL Lim said: "The Artillery is perhaps one of the most technical branches in the Army, and we have many opportunities to take advantage of technology."<br><br>"We have been able to exploit technology to enable us to have better comprehensive awareness.<br><br>It also permits us to have an <strong>integrated sensor-shooter link</strong>, at various levels of commands, cemented by good doctrine and training," he explained.<br><br>"Technology has permitted us to venture way beyond the traditional artillery, one which provided fire support to manoeuvre forces."</blockquote><a href="http://www.mindef.gov.sg/cyberpioneer/setfeatures.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.mindef.gov.sg/cyberpioneer/setfeatures.html</a><br><br><span class="large"><strong><span style="color: darkred;">CHARGE!!!</span></strong></span><br><img src="http://www.amatorce.de/Mehmet.gif"><br><br></div>
