            <div class='col-md body'>wuming, those rounds can be fired out of any howitzer in S'pore service, so there is no overall name for the system. In US service, the rounds are called ICM (improved conventional munitions), most often DPICM (dual purpose = anti-vehicle + anti-personnel) is used. The general term for the rounds are cargo rounds, though that also covers rounds which contain mines. In US service, rounds which contain mines are called FASCAM (field artillery scatterable mines).<br><br>ASTROS is a very impressive system and I congratulate Malaysia on getting them operational. They help to maintain the balance of power in the region and deter aggression from all sides, so I guess they are good in the end. If Singapore gets too strong compared to her neighbors, it would not be good either.<br><br>Of course, being in range of them means that we need to be concerned. Past experience has shown that MLRS systems are very difficult to hunt down with air or counterbattery fire, as long as the crew is skilled. I have no doubt that the SAF has some way of dealing with MLRS if they are used against us. Probably some strike aircraft will always be kept in the air with bombs but no specific target, for opportunistic strikes on high-value assets. Special forces might also be used. Maybe there is some weapon that the SAF is keeping secret, like the rumored cruise missiles or IRBM.<br><br>Regardless, it is no reason to get hostile toward HARIMAU. He is doing us a favor by telling us these things and should not be attacked for it. This is a forum, not a cock-size contest.<br><br>Anyway, happy new year, everyone.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Just an article that I found:<br><br>During the Second World War, the Russians deployed hundreds of rocket launchers in lines, firing off thousands of unguided rockets which came crashing down on German positions. The simultaneous launching of the rockets must been an awesome sight but the accuracy and effectiveness of such Â‘areaÂ’ weapons were questionable. Nevertheless, in the past few decades, military technology has greatly improved the accuracy of such rockets and has developed deadlier  warheads filled with special munitions, mines or bomblets. During the 1991 Gulf War, the American-developed Multiple Launch Rocket System made its operational debut and appeared to have made a satisfactory appearance. However, the MLRSÂ’ hefty price tag and technological complexity put it out of the reach of many armed forces in the world. The solution: the Brazilian AVIBRASÂ’ ASTROS (Artillery SaTuration ROcket System).<br><br>Shoot and scoot<br>AVIBRAS has much experience in developing multiple rocket launchers since the 1960s. In the early 1980s, a Middle Eastern country, believed to be Iraq, requested AVIBRAS to design a mobile MRL system. This resulted in the ASTROS II modular system which is mounted on a Tectran 6 x 6  truck chassis. When in a firing position, the truck deploys 4 outrigger legs to ensure stability.  On the road, the truck is able to travel at a speed up to 90 km/h while in off-road conditions, it drops to 40 km/h.  Utilising its high speed, the ASTROS can quickly enter into position, fire its rockets and flee before enemy counter-battery action can destroy it. The truck itself has no protection against enemy fire, is not protected against nuclear/biological/chemical warfare but is equipped with 6 smoke grenade launchers. On the roof of the cab, there is a M2H heavy machine gun for self-protection. The whole system is air-portable where it can be ferried by a C-130 Hercules transport aircraft.<br><br>Putting it all together<br>A typical firing battery would consist of 6 ASTROS launchers, 6 ammunition supply vehicles and 1 fire control vehicle. Each ammunition supply vehicle is able to carry 2 complete reloads. As for the fire control vehicle it is based on the well-respected Contraves Fieldguard radar system. At the battalion level, there would be a command and control vehicle which can coordinate and direct the fire missions for 3 ASTROS batteries.  All the vehicles utilise the same chassis which provides for inter-changeability.<br><br>Devastating warheads for all purpose destruction<br>The ASTROS multiple rocket launcher is an ideal offensive weapon systems due to its many different warheads. There are 4 warhead variants for the ASTROS launchers; the 32-round SS-30, 16-round SS-40, 4-round SS-60 and the 4-round SS-80. The difference in the variants is dependent on the weight and size of the rockets they fire. The numbers used in the variants indicates the range of the rockets; an example would be the SS-80 which has an impressive range of 80 km.  All the warheads are high explosive-fragmentation ones. Prior to an attack, it can be used to shatter enemy defences which enables the infantry and armour to punch through. It is able to swamp a target area with more high explosive than several batteries of conventional artillery. Alternative munitions have also been developed. There is a high explosive white phosphorous incendiary warhead which can be used against enemy personnel and material. It can also deploy smoke to conceal an impending attack. There is also a mine deploying warhead which can be used against soldiers and armoured vehicles. More ominously, the ASTROS system can be used to develop chemical agents which are far more lethal when delivered at one go rather than being steadily built up by a conventional artillery barrage. The most unique application for the ASTROS rocket would be its runway denial warhead which is able to penetrate into reinforced concrete runways up to a depth of 0.5 metres. Armed with a delayed action fuse designed to hinder repair work to the runway, it is intended to crater runways so as to prevent enemy aircraft from operating.<br><br>International success<br>Iraq took possession of 66 ASTROS II batteries which they used against Iran during the long-drawn Iran-Iraq war in the 1980s. Impressed with the weapons in their hands, they obtained the licence to build copies called the Sajil-60. Other Middle Eastern countries like Saudi Arabia, Bahrain and Qatar too chalked up impressive sales that between 1982 and 1987, sales reached US$1 billion for AVIBRAS. Both the Iraqi and Saudi ASTROS saw action during the 1991 Gulf War.<br><br>However, with the end of the war between Iran and Iraq and the decline in the Brazilian governmentÂ’s support, AVIBRAS fell into bankruptcy. Nevertheless, ABIBRAS worked off its debts slowly over the 1990s. In 1999, the Brazilian Army signed a contract to acquire the ASTROS system. As a signal of the revived fortunes for the company, the Malaysian Army also announced in November 2000, it was purchasing 18 ASTROS systems which was valued at over 185 million ringgit. Significantly, with the purchase, Malaysia would only the second ASEAN country operating an MLRS system; the other being Thailand.<br><br></div>

The Astros 2 is a waste of money.<br><br>The reasons are :<br><strong>1.They are extremely in accurate as compare to a gun howitzers.</strong><br><br>They are inaccurate becos they are not guided.<br>The west(including US &amp; Israel) does not even produced or deployed any rockets systems that have the range above 50km in the 90s, this is becos of the extreme inaccuracy of a unguided rockets system above 50kms which will most probably cause more collateral damage than hitting the target. Only recently with GPS guidance they then started to develop LR rockets. Check the link below for the US MRLS:<br><br><a href="http://www.army-technology.com/projects/himars/index.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.army-technology.com/projects/himars/index.html</a><br><br>Even though the CEP of the ASTROS 2 is not given by the Brazilian, a similar unguided system from China will give us a rough idea.The Chinese has boosted that their system has a CEP of 1-1.5%. Therefore assuming the Astros2 is as accurate as the Chinese system(most probably not as the Chinese has more experiences in rocket technology than the Brazilian), the SS80 at the range of 80km will hit the traget with an error of 800m - 1600m!!!<br><br>Check the link below for the Chinese MRLS:<br><br><a href="http://www.army-technology.com/projects/ws1b/index.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.army-technology.com/projects/ws1b/index.html</a><br><br><strong>2. The unguided system is also much expensive &amp; its rocket is also much more expensive then a gun system and it's projectiles.</strong><br><br><strong>3.Becos of it's electronics, it will also be less reliable than a simple projectile and charges of a gun system.The Astros 2 is also less efficient than any other available system.</strong><br><br>Astros 2 has complicated electronics ,therefore there is always the possibility of electronic error.Currently US missile technology allows for a 10-20 percent failure rate. That could prove deadly if the vehicles were offering close artillery support.<br><br>The Astros 2 has no mechanical loading facilities, the 5.6m SS80 rockets will have to loaded manually by manpower. Therefore after the one salvo, it need to be scoot and take some time for it to reloaded. One more thing, becos of the size of the rocket(5.6m), it might even be shot down by modern AA guns &amp; missiles.<br><br>In conclusion,for a range of 40km and below, it will be cheaper as well much more accurate using a gun howitzers than rockets especially with today laser/GPS guided arty gun shell.<br><br>For range above 50 km, the US , Israeli &amp; Russian are still developing the GPS guided rockets that have even higher range than Astros 2, I am sure that the SAF is looking closely on these development. IIRC, the Israeli GPS guided rocket system has a CEP of 5m at 100km range.<br><br><span class="large"><strong><span style="color: darkred;">CHARGE!!!</span></strong></span><br><img src="http://www.amatorce.de/Mehmet.gif"><br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I believe the truth of the matter is, that the MAF ASTROS II will be more of a terror weapon like V2 Buzz Bombs then actual tatical weapons designed to deal damage. Great for shooting a city full of civillian targets, but not good for suppressing a moving enemy force far away.<br><br>Moving the MLRS close where it can get better at shooting would expose it to SAF tube arty, in which the ASTROS will be woefully undergunned. Maybe that's why SAF just revealed the Primus, self propelled arty pieces to balance the ASTROS. While the ASTROS can get off a massive barrage in one salvo, it is unable to sustain a steady barrage with corrections. If they fail to suppress their target with one shot, they better be running rather then struggling to reload.<br><br>The Primus on the other hand, can snap off a few shots, move and reload at the same time. I wonder which is of more tatical value in the long run...</div>
