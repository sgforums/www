Try going into battle thinking that MLRS is useless, only to find out that all you know and has spew out in this forum as BS! It would be too late, my fren.</div></blockquote>Ahem, that's a nice way to discuss... quote a "credible" source and turn tail and run. For somebody who claims to want to find the true capabilities, this stick-your-finger-in-your-ears-and-sing-lalala in general ignorance to logic is bizzare and self-contradictory.<br><br>Note that you have not provided even one point to refute what I have clearly pointed out save the credibly of your Maj-Gen quoted out of context and ad nauseum. So be it.<br><br>Then again many credible Maj-Gens also thought that the tank would never replace horse calvary. Sometimes it helps to see logic then see the medals and buttons on a uniform.<br><br>What's next, if this credible source states that the revolutionary weapon is the rubber band powered slingshot firing glass marbles at 20 m/s based on a quote and on data unknown to you and me, I suppose you would go all out and believe him no matter what, why not trade in your M16 for it?<br><br>What we are doing here is simply showing the ASTROS II for what it all is, and I'm sure for once the guys up there are watching this more carefully then we or you would care to do.<br><br>The truth of the matter is, nobody here said the ASTROS II was useless, it was your impression based on your flawed and myopic reading of the posts. What so many have pointed out were the obvious <span style="font-style: italic;">limitations</span> of the such a system.<br><br>After all, nobody is dowplaying the ASTROS II as a system that can't shoot. What we are doing here is demolishing the paper tiger's (who has been mysteriously silent) fantasy that the ASTROS II can lob rockets with impunity from 89 kilometers away and there's nothing we can do about it. Such a view is obviously flawed, as demostrated to do such a thing is not anywhere nearly as easy as it seems, there are certain things the system cannot do (that some rapid MAF supporter happy disregards)<br><br>If anybody is making baseless speculations, that would be you. Note that all the supposed sore grapes and wet blankets are the ones who have been doing their homework and posting forward revealing facts and figures and making educated deductions. Nobody is dismissing the ASTROS II "threat", they are putting it in it's proper context.<br><br>You on the other hand, decide rely on a quote from a Maj-Gen of which context you probably barely understand. Bizzare, considering this is coming from a person who claims he wants the capability of the Astros to be known accurately. Well it seems like he isn't doing much homework save for the "it more mean and deadily then you think" pitch ad nauseum. Show your facts beyond a quote.<br><br>How credible is this Maj-Gen's quote, if a higher ranking officer thinks otherwise? What about the USAF who thinks smart munitions are the revolution in warfare? How do you account for them? Apparently the Maj-Gen's words represent reality to you and not logic.<br><br>Obviously SAF is not going to sit around and say "oh we're doomed" in response to the ASTROS II, at the same time, they will, and probably are doing something about it. And from what we know, given our prelim data, that the ASTROS II is hardly as good as the Malaysians crank it out to be, impressive no doubt, but far from being immortal and full of vulnerabilities to boot.<br><br>We don't claim the Bionix is a wonder IFV, first in the world, and capable of running down the causeway, shooting up the whole MAF and driving all the way up to KL to deliever the <span style="font-style: italic;">coup de grace</span>. It's easy to see how anybody in response can take apart this argument rapidly as paper tiger's faith in his MLRS toy has been rapidly demolished.<br><br>In the end it's just a weapon, and one we can respond to. The idea is to get a good picture of what it can do, and act accordingly. Fear mongering and relying on credible Maj-Gens. is hardly the way to cut it, you need to have serious facts and logic at hand, something you apparently seriously lack.</div>

Would it cut it to lob a few submunitions into the US embassy?<br><br>They can get the capacity to flatten Singapore if they like, but the truth is, that won't cut it too well with the rest of the world. The very problem with having a weapon like that. You can't use it unless you are very desperate, and crazy enough to be considered a terrorist state in the world.<br><br>Such a tatic would be as self defeating to them as using nukes, it's so terrible that they can't employ it.<br><br>So take a jet plane view and stop fuddling about sauturation strikes, when their main concern is getting in at enemy troops.

            <div class='col-md body'>By the way it's good to note it takes more then one salvo of rockets to reduce an urban area to wasteland. Submunitions are small pockets of explosives and lack the ommph to cause extensive damage to structures. They are good for porkmarking runways and killing anybody caught in the open with no cover. Don't delude yourself and a shower of oversized hand grenades can create nuclear-war like effects.<br><br>Of course inevitably the kind of targets submunitions will end up affecting the worst are soft targets, civillians local and not, good as a self-defeating terror stragety employed by some fanatic terrorist bloc, but the MAF? Unless they are suffering from a bad case of bravado.</div>

On the plus side, the rockets would not be exposed to the vagaries of the weather hence prolonging the lifespan. With the rockets in the container and prewired within the container, the external wirings from the container to the launch vehicle would have been much reduced....almost like plug-and play.<br><br>As analogy, to change the harddisk within you computer would require you to open the chasis, unplug the IDE cable, power supply blah blah. Then you insert the new HD and plugin all the cables again, fasten the screws....this would be like changing you engine in the armoured vehicle. If you don't do this often, its acceptable to have a process that takes this long.<br><br>However, if you envisage that you will change the HD routinely, you will be better off getting a removable HD drive. You preconnect the drive into your PC, mount the HD  into the cassete that comes with  the removable HD. Now you can change your HD quickly by inserting the cassete into the drive....<br>That would be they way, the containerised rockets work.<br><br>Reloading the MLRS launchers is a routine activity, and the engineers would have work something like that into the rocket loading mechanism.<br><br>I would say the containerised rocket pod allows this "plug-and-play" method with minimal fastening and connections to the launch vehicle.<br>Its more expensive than russia's exposed rockets method, therefore the added expense have to be justified by design benefits.<br><br>As i said, using the russian method(which surely have been considered by the Brazillian engineers) would result in 12mins of reload time.<br>I would put 6mins of reload time needed for the Astros as resaonable.<br><br>You have a very naive view of the Brazillian engineers....they are not that stupid to adopt a reloading method that is worst off compared to the russian way.</div></blockquote>You simplistic methodology really astonishing!!<br>Even to remove one such big object from a trunk takes at least 10mins. First someone have to climb the the "containers" to hook the steel cable , then move the crane to hookup with the steel cable then slowly lift the "container" and swing it to another trunk &amp; lower it down then unhook the steel cable,for safety purpose lifting &amp; moving the large object by a crane could not be done quick.<br>Repeat the whole process for the new "container" this itself take another 10 mins!!!<br>The time for unhooking &amp; rehooking of coupling is not even included.<br>Since you have no engineering background, dun take my word for it ,go ask those who have experience in lifting a large object using a crane , show them the picture &amp; ask them how fast could this be done as I described.<br>Obviously, you dun believe me  for someone who as such experiences, and I dun want argue with you on this!<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by observe:</div><div class="quote_body">[quote][b]<br>Now, back to the controlled rockets,<br>While the design of the Astros may be earlier, but who is to say that the will not be any improvements to the rockets. Afterall, the rockets is just the ammo, you can change the rocket design anytime when new technologies have been tested and proven.<br><br></div></blockquote>The Astros 2 was fielded in 1982.(it is certainly no controlled rocket)<br>The first angular stabilisation rocket was fielded by the russian in 1988.<br><br>The company has financial problem in the late 80s, abt the same time as the Smerch MLRS was fielded, then in 1990, all R&amp;D has been cancelled.<br><br>Even till now there is no report of a improved rocket from them,or  any example like SS80 Mk2 or Improved SS80 etc, the designation remain the same.<br><br>So where you got the info that a improved rocket is out where no one including AvibrÃ¡s seem to know about it!?!<br><br>So dun make assumption there is a improved version, if I am from AvibrÃ¡s, and AvibrÃ¡s came out with a angular stabilisation rocket which improve the CEP, I will tell the whole world abt it so that I could sell more with this new rockets!!!!<br><br><a href="http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/world/brazil/astros.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/world/brazil/astros.htm</a><br><br>From the link above, there is no mentioned any new rockets, control or guidance system as well as reload time for the current rockets.<br><br>Either they are non existance or with spec that are too poor to be proud of, otherwise they will reveal them to make more sales.<br><br>As I said before, unless you have any documentary proof to rebut me for what I have stated above , your assumptions dun interest me!</div>

And counter-battery radars are pretty vulnerable too, if they are not careful with EMCON procedures. Of course there are other ways to find the Astros, but pls do not make it sound so easy as "oh, we'll use our searchers to find them" or " those extended range JDAMs from from CAS would fit the job nicely." UAVs, even with teir endurance, are not exactly very good tools for wide area search of a particular system. And do we really have F-16s orbiting 24 hrs a day with nothing else to do but to wait for an MLRS salvo? And by the way, what makes you think that they are so willing to be found by us?

No bias before that.<br><br>Tactically useless in the sense that it has very low success rate in meeting it military objectives w/o incurring a high amount of damage against civillian targets.<br><br>I am sure a salvo of Astros 2 will cause some damage to military facilities but certainly will not disable our ability to strike back &amp; strike back hard!!!</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Exactly, it never fails to amaze me how some think that their latest MAF latest toy will be a war-winner. Especially when they bring that attitude in here, and expect to be entertained.<br><br>It easy to see how it degenerates,  pointing out basic flaws basically leads to the basically joker losing it, making wilder and wilder claims which require a forceful application of logic to refute. Unfortunately if it's anything we've learnt, is that logic applied to their brand of irrationality only breeds wilder responses. What started out as a simple "hey you said this now how can you account for so and so" typically becomes imflamed not by merit of us trying to be nationalistic, but them simply refusing to face up to the facts that things are not as easy as they seem.<br><br>To get a general idea of paper tiger's true grasp on reality, go read the SAR-21 with foregrip thread. Apparently he bought simplistic childish propangada on the true nature of the weapon, and even took it to it's utterly discusting and nonsenscial extreme. And then sued for peace when it became apparent the obvious logic in this case was about to beat him upside down.<br><br>Other general MAF fanatics frequenting this forum have also shown much case of bravado but little brain. Go read the case of the sick malaysian fantasy on how the mighty righteous MAF dishes it out on an cardboard character SAF which is generally deaf, dumb and blind and willing submits to whatever the MAF dishes out as if we were the chinese navy in Tom Clancy's SSN. Also in prehaps the most delusional eposides, another MAF zealot came in heralding the PT-91 as the most advanced MBT in the world, and was greatly angered and confused when the facts didn't tally with his rethoric. Is this behaviour typical of Malaysian Military Nuts?<br><br>Compare this to the nature of Singaporean Military Nutters, they are in general a self-critical bunch who at many times overly criticize their own equipment, some of which are light years ahead of anything the ego-tripping MAF has. We make frank critique on the SM1 "tank" (prehaps if we were like MAF zealots, we would claim it could easily outflank and outfight MBTs?), ponder over the lack of protection on our LSVs, and complain (much of it unjustified in the light of facts) about the SAR-21 quirks. Does this sound like propangada buying nationalistic people wanting to create sina.com?<br><br>Eventually you drag this long enough and when the evidence stacks up overwhelmingly, they either go silent or start the routine of sticking-fingers-in-ears-and-sing-lalala and quote "credible" Maj. Gen's and stick to them like their security boosters. And of course, MLRS holocaust stories soon appear. Singaporean or Malaysian, whoever can come up with such a story shows the general "grasp" of reality.<br><br>ASTROS II demands an apporiate response, and that is not to laugh it off as harmless or useless (if you read carefully, nobody said it was useless, just NOT AS USEFUL as the MAF zelAots would like to believe), and behaving as if they have gotten the ultimate weapon that can nuke us all and we're dead meat is also hardly rational. My verdict? No that thing can't wipe us out in a few barrages or reduce Sg to a wasteland, that's what nukes generally are for. Nor would they, even if they could, for very obvious reasons.<br><br>Apparently his attempted "helicopter view" on the big picture has turned out to be a big case of Super Puma down. For some reason he just can't get the idea into his mind that there is a lot we can do about the ASTROS II threat, and not only that, it is within our means to easy trump that capacity, if we wanted to.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Exactly, Singapore still has a defence budget 4 times that of Malaysia, we ain't exactly gonna sit around doing nothing.<br><br>That's why this ASTROS II incident is more of a matter of propangada feel-good rethoric then an actual edge for the MAF, since they know that Singapore can easily go tit-for-tat, and counter them at every move, and do much more.<br><br>ASTROS II is a good leveler for them, for while they can't match us for quality or quantity, if worse come to worse, they can at least have a capacity to hurt Singapore in any way they can short of employing MAF sucide bombers. The problem that remains for them is how to catch up with the gap in their military and ours, using a budget that is 4 times less. No matter what they do, there's really little they can do to really catch up, not unless we screw up very badly on our part.<br><br>While it's easy to match capacity because the MAF knows what to buy, we have to be a lot more careful with our cash because we have to stay ahead of the game, so while they can just blindly follow us and try to match up in equipment, we have to crack our heads and really carefully consider how to get the most bang for our buck. If you look at our recent advanced technology projects, you'll realize that we are not trying to be unreal, but rather get a big headstart on technologies that will prove to be very important in the future war.<br></div>
