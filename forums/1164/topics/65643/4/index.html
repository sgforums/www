The reason those Iraqi's were pummeled was generally because their exact location was known, in the desert (no cover) were generally poorly organized (bunched together and hence tended to get wiped out in one hit), non moving, and generally had no way of striking back (hence the Americans could just camp there and fire away with impunity without have to shoot and scoot.)<br><br>At 89km, the ASTROS II is nothing more then an area weapon, where it would probably hit everything BUT the target. Which would most likely turn out to be civilian targets and the like. Given the urban nature of fighting future combat here, those long range ASTROS II commanders will end up fragging an awful lot of civillians on both sides if they decide to fire from extreme range. Imagine submunitions falling over one map grid square of JB. More likely their civvies will sustain more damage then actual military hard targets (though an SM1 tank isn't exactly hard).<br><br>Yes the ASTROS II can hit stuff beyond 40 clicks, but it's accuracy is such that tatically it is for all pratical reasons, pretty usless. Maybe unless they want to use it as some form of poor man's WMD.<br><br>Hence forth, to be really effective, more tatically useful and less hedious, they will have to move their ASTROS an awful lot closer and far more vulnerable.<br><br>Unless SAF really screws up like the Iraqi army in responding to the MLRS, to expect a stellar preformance from a one-shot, slow reloading system like the ASTROS II is pretty optimistic on the malaysian side. Maybe the assume anything fired south would hit something of tatical value?<br><br>As said, Sg is better off, and probably is, waiting for guided rocket technology to mature before buying those expensive-butt systems to show off.<br><br>The truth is, in terms of equipment-parity, the Malaysians are always on the losing end when it comes to getting new hardware to top Singapore. This is because they usually have to spend tons of $$$ on stuff just to match up. or slightly suceed Singapore's headstart, and all Singapore has to do is to camp out, wait for new technologies to cheapen and mature before leapfrogging ahead once again. Unless they want to turn a inordinate amount of their GDP towards defence to superceed the SAF, diplomancy and rethoric has always been their forte, and avenue of choice. As long as the Malaysians have enough guns to make sure Singaporean victory can never be bloodless, and Singaporean has enough military advantage over Malaysian to rein them in, the balance of power is preserved.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I suspect the ASTROS II is popular because it makes a good poor man's MLRS.<br><br>The point on ASTROS inprecision stands, it's not a matter of covering a large area, but actually hitting the right things that matters. As I said, risking having hundreds of submunitions fall on civillian areas along with the target when fired from extreme range is not a very good option for ASTROS commanders. The reason why the MLRS was so effective against Iraqi forces was generally because they didn't move much, didn't shoot back, and were caught flat footed in the open desert with no cover from the incoming submunitions. I doubt this kind of factors apply in the heavily forrested and urbanized landscape. As the russians rapidly discovered when using MLRS in recent times. Sometimes calling down precise, one round fire is far more effective.<br><br>Hence, ASTROS at extreme range is generally ineffective as a tatical weapon. It would be pratically useless for trying to root out an armoured force in an urban area, worse if friendlys are close to their targets. For it to be useful is to bring it closer into the fight and that would mean rapid mincemeatation by Sg arty.<br><br>More likely, I suspect the ASTROS II system could serve the malaysians more as a desperate last ditch system which they use when all else fails. Their best bet is to use it only when they are absolutely sure of wiping out a large number of enemy as possible, in which case would entail firing on a concentration of enemy forces at relatively short arty range. In which it would probably work very well, and with rather spectular results. Hence forth, it's no surprise ASTROS II will be will sought after by Sg munitions in any future conflict.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>It also be good to know that another vulnerability of MLRS systems is that they stick out like a sore thumb signature wise on launch. Outgoing mail is many, many times easier to track on counterbattery radar and the launcher will be located in short order. Now they have to worry about incoming mail, which could arrive in any form, arty, airpower or extended range smart munitions.<br><br>That's why a couple of minutes of reloading time is an eternity in battle. The traditional reason why MLRS are generally employed (and most useful) in situtations where the enemy cannot strike back.<br><br>Used within the range of tubed guns where it is more precise, the ASTROS will find it impossible to reload safely. To stay still for 4-6 min while under counterbattery fire is sucide. Hence the ASTROS has to learn to stay hidden in any situtation or it's toast. It's no wonder weapon for sure.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>i prefer to keep the discussion to the technicals rather than baseless rhetorics....<br><br>A quote from Maj-Gen Robert H. Scales Jr, Chief Instructor of Artillery School-Fort Sill (USA).<br><br>Quote"This is the key lesson of the war. The American ratio was eight to one SP to towed. Iraqi artillery was one to ten. Before the ground war began, Iraqis detached most truck primers and employed these to haul supplies. As a result the Iraqi artillery could not displace between missions. The Iraqis hoped to compensate for their lack of mobility by bunkering guns and ammunition ... In previous wars, this was an effective technique because towed artillery is a most difficult target to destroy with indirect fire.... However, the appearance of MLRs and bomblet ammunition (smart ammunition too - parenthesis mine) has changed the equation radically. With a single point of explosion, to cause damage fragments must strike an equilibrator, gun sight or propellant storage to kill a towed gun - a very unlikely prospect. A two-third maximum range with dumb ammunition (as against smart-parenthesis mine) the probability is about one in two thousands. But with multiple impacts from bomblets ammunition delivered with less than 50 meters error thanks to CM Radars, position locating devices, digital fire control, etc., <strong>the probability of incapacitating a gun is about one in ten for each volley fired, about one in three for a single MLR pod ... Remember today the radius of error is now smaller than the radius of effect for indirect fire - that is the real technological revolution in modern ground warfare - not precision munitions as the popular Press attests....'<br></strong></div>

If you read his quote CAREFULLY, "A two-third maximum range with dumb ammunition (as against smart-parenthesis mine) the probability is about one in two thousands." which puts the dumb munition at around 650 times LESS effective than rocket arty. Also note that due to less ammo being put down on the target instantaneously, tube arty's 'shock' value is much less than rocket arty. Its lethality is also similiarly lesser as troops will have time to find cover after the initial barrage, and so the subsequent barrages will achieve much lesser effect.<br><br>First posters in this forum tried to discredit the MLRS lethality at ranges beyond 40km. Then it got to MLRS was less lethal then tube arty. I wonder what next... Are we not able to face reality that they have an arty system more lethal than ours? (That's not to say that its totally appropriate for our region, or that it can be effectively used by them). But to say that its not lethal or whatever, that oh, our Primus will beat their Astros, this just stinks.....</div>

I beg to differ, after all he <span style="font-style: italic;">is</span> the chief of Artillery. I seriously urge you to take his statement in context. Considering the overall effectiveness of smart munitions versus indirect fire error zone munitions, and playing into account the current trend of technological development. It is quite safe to say that smart munitions, not ballastics, is the way of the future.<br><br>Lest you assume that I have no acess to data, I can assure you that I have researched quite extensively into this subject. For further reading, I urge you to read "The Future of War" by George and Meredith Friedman to fully understand the implications of the impact of smart technology on warfare beyond CNN hype. The implications are real, and are here to stay.<br><br>Consider the following. Inherently inprecise, ballastic weapons rely on producing as many projectiles as possible to ensure a a single hit. Hence you have guns firing in volleys, submunition rounds and the like, which as simply permutations of one theme: Produce as many projectiles as possible to get a hit with unguided weapons. The MLRS preformance in the war is not revolutionary, it was evolutionary. And even with an incredibly wasteful load of over 600 submutions per rocket and 12 rockets per pod, it only manages to gasp out a 33 percent hit rate, wasting most of the explosive power in the shell by splattering flat ground. The truth is, most of the bomblets simply miss entirely or worse, go dud.<br><br>The MLRS system is not more accucrate, it's simply a instant arty barrage packed into a pod. It is not revolutionary, it is simply ballastic weapons taken to it's logical, and senile extreme. Is this the revolution you are looking for? Maybe if you have had no experience with smart weapons. If the MLRS was the revolution the army was looking for, I dred to wonder what would have happened if they parked those things short of Bagdad and fired in their revolutionary arty to destroy the key targets there. Apparently they didn't do that.<br><br>With smart munitions you don't have to have big-butt launchers belching out hundreds of rounds and scattering hundreds of thousands of submunitions (with a high dud rate) to suppress a target. Instead of mailing ever increasing amounts of explosives to the enemy just to kill him, with most of it being wasted, you can now apply the right amount of firepower per target.<br><br>Logically, it is obvious that the development and use of smart munitions was the weapons revolution of our time. It's obvious the Maj. Gen. statements are quite easy to dismiss in the context of an expert in turboprop propulsion looking at a jet plane and saying "it has no propeller". To take him at his word simply because "he should know what he's saying" is prehaps dumping common sense for blind faith. Whatever happened to the experts during Vietnam which proclaimed long before AAM technology was mature, that all fighters should go gunless then? Plenty believed them.<br><br>To put it in prespective, try imagining Desert Storm or Iraqi Freedom without MLRS, would it still work? Now try ommiting smart munitions. Now that would make a difference.<br><br>Smart technology is the way to go, and it's something the SAF is chasing with quite a lot of zeal instead of getting every increasing numbers of guns to shoot every increasing numbers of rounds and rockets.<br><br>The arty of the future? It's in precision guided missile arty dude.</div>

And since it takes a while to reload, and can't reload on the move like SPs, it better run forrest run until it finds some place to hide.

Comparing the two systems in terms of tatical usefulness hardly consitutes a my dad can beat you dad thing.<br><br>If would be fallacious to assume this system would also have anything near the capability of the american MLRS system. The ASTROS is a far smaller system, with only four rockets one needs to note.<br><br>As stated, this is far from a case of sour grapes, more like wet blankets on the overwhelming zeal of a certain paper tiger on the MAF's latest toy. Will the ASTROS II work in battle, certainly, but it takes far more thinking, planning, and organization then just launching rockets that fly 89km. Many things he failed to take into account. And maybe the MAF as well when they bought these systems along with tons of other hardware that consitutes their jumbled equipment big shopping spree for last year.<br><br>My personal opinion? I feel the MAF didn't weight in everything that well when it decided to get the ASTROS II. It looks great in their propangada flicks but I wonder if that thing is as good as it is cranked out to be, especially when the impression I am getting from their protractors is that the only thing you need to do is to point and shoot and automatic sucess is assured. What about attrition, logistics, maintence and keeping those darned things from getting blown to bits in the first place. It in same thread, I wonder what's up with them getting hardware of so many different makes.<br><br>If the SAF is wanting to aquire MLRS capability, (and probably is considering so) it is doing so carefully and waiting for the technology to mature, or is actively developing some on it's on. Especially in the area of network centric fire mission coordination (think TOT capability, everytime from every assigned gun in the SAF), guided rockets, and the like. In which case would certainly inspire a case of sore grapes up north who had just spent millions on an less-well thought out system.<br><br>So there.</div>

Scales Jr, Chief Instructor of Artillery School-Fort Sill (USA).<br><br>Quote"This is the key lesson of the war. The American ratio was eight to one SP to towed. Iraqi artillery was one to ten. Before the ground war began, Iraqis detached most truck primers and employed these to haul supplies. As a result the Iraqi artillery could not displace between missions. The Iraqis hoped to compensate for their lack of mobility by bunkering guns and ammunition ... In previous wars, this was an effective technique because towed artillery is a most difficult target to destroy with indirect fire.... However, the appearance of MLRs and bomblet ammunition (smart ammunition too - parenthesis mine) has changed the equation radically. With a single point of explosion, to cause damage fragments must strike an equilibrator, gun sight or propellant storage to kill a towed gun - a very unlikely prospect. A two-third maximum range with dumb ammunition (as against smart-parenthesis mine) the probability is about one in two thousands. But with multiple impacts from bomblets ammunition delivered with less than 50 meters error thanks to CM Radars, position locating devices, digital fire control, etc., [b]the probability of incapacitating a gun is about one in ten for each volley fired, about one in three for a single MLR pod ...

            <div class='col-md body'>[quote]<strong><br><br>Pre-connected  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br>Obviously you have no engineering background, how could the tube stay in place when the veh move w/o mechanical couplings to hold them !!!!<br><br>Where does the tube get it power from for firing w/o the power from the veh batteries.<br>and lastly where does the electrical signal that needed for firing!<br><br>All these need to be hookup to vehicles, no such thing as pre-connected in this case.</strong><br><br>firstly, if the Astros rockets were designed like the Russian Smerch, it would take 12mins to reload the 4 SS60/SS80 tubes from the back.<br><br>For an arty system. the design engineers would have taken this reload time as one of their design parameter.<br><br>They have chosen to house the rockets in container pods....which means it is more expensive than the russians method. On the plus side, the rockets would not be exposed to the vagaries of the weather hence prolonging the lifespan. With the rockets in the container and prewired within the container, the external wirings from the container to the launch vehicle would have been much reduced....almost like plug-and play.<br><br>As analogy, to change the harddisk within you computer would require you to open the chasis, unplug the IDE cable, power supply blah blah. Then you insert the new HD and plugin all the cables again, fasten the screws....this would be like changing you engine in the armoured vehicle. If you don't do this often, its acceptable to have a process that takes this long.<br><br>However, if you envisage that you will change the HD routinely, you will be better off getting a removable HD drive. You preconnect the drive into your PC, mount the HD  into the cassete that comes with  the removable HD. Now you can change your HD quickly by inserting the cassete into the drive....<br>That would be they way, the containerised rockets work.<br><br>Reloading the MLRS launchers is a routine activity, and the engineers would have work something like that into the rocket loading mechanism.<br><br>I would say the containerised rocket pod allows this "plug-and-play" method with minimal fastening and connections to the launch vehicle.<br>Its more expensive than russia's exposed rockets method, therefore the added expense have to be justified by design benefits.<br><br>As i said, using the russian method(which surely have been considered by the Brazillian engineers) would result in 12mins of reload time.<br>I would put 6mins of reload time needed for the Astros as resaonable.<br><br>The US MLRS takes only 3min to reload and they too house their rockets in container pods.<br><br>You have a very naive view of the Brazillian engineers....they are not that stupid to adopt a reloading method that is worst off compared to the russian way.<br><br>Now, back to the controlled rockets,<br>While the design of the Astros may be earlier, but who is to say that the will not be any improvements to the rockets. Afterall, the rockets is just the ammo, you can change the rocket design anytime when new technologies have been tested and proven.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>to ST,<br><br>say what you like, i would prefer to base my conclusions on a credible source like the Maj-Gen.<br><br>I think it would serve the SAF much better if the capability of the Astros is known accurately.<br><br>All this speculation, many without any basis or proof, only leads to misinformation. Try going into battle thinking that MLRS is useless, only to find out that all you know and has spew out in this forum as BS! It would be too late, my fren.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>One question, when is this report based on ? GW1 or GW2?<br><br>Current US MLRS has maximum range for normal rocket is above 32km, the extended range which was first field in 1998 is 45km.<br><br>It has a 33% of success at 2/3 of maximum rangefor a single pod of 6 rockets(21km for normal rocket or for ext range rocket 30km).<br><br>Logically at range of 80km , the success rate will be even lower !!!!<br><br>Based on report of 50m error, The CEP will be either 50/21000=0.23% or 50/30000=0.16%.The former is more likely.<br><br>The report tell how "good" Astros 2 with CEP of 1% is in term of tactical value, afterall the report is based on US technology(with CEP of 0.2-0.3%), not Brazilian. [Mr. Green]<br><br>Another quote from your link:<br>quote:Firing small- and large-caliber rockets featuring traditional aeroballistic configurations and with mean deviations from the target of about ~1%X of the firing range and a consistency of up to 1/150 becomes ineffective at a range in excess of 40 km.<br><br>That is why the US never developed any unguided LR rocket above 45km!</strong><br><br>You keep bringing this CEP and doubting the Astros accuracy...to put things in perspective, let me paint a simple scenario...(i have provided this info in a previous thread on Astros). I hope i don't scare you with it.<br><br>1 Astros launcher - 4 SS80 rockets.<br>Each rockets can provide area saturation with anti-personnel, anti-amour submunition to 1 sqkm.<br><br>1 regt with 18 lauchers - 72 rockets<br>2 regt with 36 launchers - 144 rockets in one salvo.<br><br>From the first launch, 144sqkm will be saturated with blasts from submunitions.<br><br>Therefore, to blanket an area of 640sqkm, it will require 5 salvoes.<br><br>Time from launch to a target 89km away - 2 min<br>Reload time - 6 min<br>Time taken for 5 salvoes - 34min.<br><br>Assuming if you do survive the first barrage, and recover from the shock....you have 32min to mount a response, else within the next 32min, an area of 640sqkm will be reduce to wasteland.<br><br>This is their version of "Shock and Awe"....coming from the MLRS.<br>The tube arty will followup with sustain arty fire.<br><br>That is why MLRS and tube arty are complementary.<br><br>Now tell me, would CEP be important here. Don't muddle yourself with the leaves when what you need is a helicopter view.<br><br>[/b]</div>
