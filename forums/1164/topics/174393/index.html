            <div class='col-md body'>For co-operating with the United States to help bring to justice terrorists who bombed and killed innocent civilians, Pakistan was bombed by the United States warplanes in which innocent civilians were killed.<br><br>The US authorised this airstrike apparently without first notifying Pakistani authorities.<br><br>this should be a lesson to those who think the US military is your protector. They are inept and their methods are clumsy. And they really do not care about innocent civilians being killed in the countries they are sent to "protect" or "liberate" etc.<br><br>I just can't believe how arrogant they can get.<br><br>And they still didn't get their target. Basically, they needed to assassinate a terrorist leader. By assassinate you think of sniper rifle, silenced pistol or maybe a SWAT team. The weapon of choice for US, unfortunately, was a F-16.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Most of us don't feel much about Pakistani civilians being collateral damage.<br><br>But imagine that CIA informed the US military that a JI leader is hiding out in BLK 288 in Yishun. And they call in a F-16 airstrike or they shell the building with a tank.<br><br>That's how useless they are. So if we are in any kind of trouble better take care of it ourselves and don't give Uncle Sam an excuse to offer "help".<br><br>Remember in hunting Bin Laden in Afghanistan they sent out B-52's to bomb the mountains? That was a real joke. That was the clearest sign that the Americans knew NOTHING, absolutely NOTHING, about unconventional warfare. They killed a lot of Afghan villagers then, as well.<br><br>If the US hired the Mossad to hunt Bin Laden, they would've got him already and they woul;dn't need to kill so many innocent people.<br><br>Someone should make a calculation of how many innocent civilians are killed in US 911 vs how many innocent civilians the US killed n Afghanistan, Pakistan and Iraq.</div>

The term started as a euphemism during the Vietnam War and is still regarded as such by many; as <strong>a phrase intended to hide the reality that innocent civilians have been killed or have had their property destroyed</strong>."<br><br></div>

It's just that they had become so into it, and has done so many times with no consequence, that they had developed a" so what are you going to do about it" superiority attitude. Precision strikes has upgraded to a Jdam strike... notice the progress ? They even had bombed a Chinese Embassy, with no worries whatsoever... UN ? what's UN ?

However, don't you think that a better way of handling the situation, both diplomatically and strategically, would be to  send in troops to attempt an arrest?<br><br>Have the US run out of troops? Or do they not have a rapid reaction force in place for contingencies? I find both of these propositions preposterous.<br><br>Re the possible argument that they are afraid their targets might move, I guess the difference between sending in planes/heli/drones to drop a bomb shouldn't be that great?<br><br>I also agree that Musaraffs position is very tenuous and he probably needs to get ont eh good books of the US. But isn't the reverse true? Would the US want a radical to get control of pakistan's nukes? The answer is clearly not.</div>
