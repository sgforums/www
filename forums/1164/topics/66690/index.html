BTW, I still feel that the MCVs are still too new and really still good for a while.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I think its a bit early to consider this as the missile corvettes are still relatively new. However, it will be a great idea to predict what will be the likely replacement for it. I personally think the Visby class will suit the RSN as it fits well into the overall SAF policy of going stealth. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I think the next item on the list are a couple of Offshore patrol vessels (OPV). These will be built by ST Marine. The expertise will be those gained from building the stealth frigates.<br><br>It is similar to how we built the PVs after building some of the MCVs.<br><br>This is out in the open domain.

            <div class='col-md body'>Heres wat i think that might be incoporated in the future OPVs or corvettes.<br><br>- High-energy laser to intercept    incoming missiles and aircraft.<br>- Ultra-rapid Naval Gun that can be retracted to increase ship's stealth<br>- Or even better, small scale gauss gun<br>- Next-Gen Super-sonic antiship sea-skimming missiles<br>- Ultra-quiet waterjet propulsion system<br>- Fog machine to hide ship<br>- Radar absorbent paint and make the ship look "invisible" at long distances<br>- Flat surfaces and ultra-low profile to increase stealth.<br>- and of course the latest targeting, navigational and EW suites.<br>- ability to host naval UAVs.<br>- new torpedoes<br><br>did i miss anything out?</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>oh yar... i like to add something called smart mines. Basically a torpedo in a capsule dropped off in an area. It sinks to the required depth and waits for nearby enemy ship to arrive. Sends back info to mothership if there is a target. mothership can then choose to engage target. BOOM! torpedo blasts out from capsule and attacks enemy vessel. By the time the enemy realises theres an incoming torpedo, they would already be knee-deep in water. for increased effect, drop off more mines in area to increase chances of sinking vessel.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by V1NS@niTY:</div><div class="quote_body">OPV cannot have all those stuff meh?</div></blockquote>Well, most OPVs I know come in the other direction.......<br><br>The cheapest part of a warship is actually the hull and associated stuffs. It's the weapons systems that accounts for the bulk of the costs........<br><br>I think the cost for Delta frigates is around US$170m but some have speculated it is too low a figure and thinks that the price for the hulls only.<br><br>So the OPV which is basically an empty warship in waiting able to be re-configured to a full fledged one in times of war. These OPVs are used in peace time for fisheries protection and patrol of Offshore Economic Zones.<br><br>Look at the UK and Irish navy for an idea of OPVs. I think there's the Castle class, Cassiopea(now part of Philipine navy?) and there's a new River class.<br><br>Some time back, I read SingTech actually got the design rights to one of them - Eithne class. Strangely the dimensions for the 'Stealth OPV' is very similar too.<br><br>Please visit the unofficial irish navy website for a description of their OPVs:<br><a href="http://www.geocities.com/Yosemite/Geyser/2790/NavalService/navals.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.geocities.com/Yosemite/Geyser/2790/NavalService/navals.html</a><br><br>Having read ST Marine's press release for the IMDEX03....... when a vessel is 27m how much more stealthy do you need to make it? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br><br>Mr David Copperfield........anyone?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"></div>

The Israelis learn it the hard way with one sinking.........I pray we don't have another RSS Courageous with the subs.<br><br>The Indian Navy had a interesting idea for sub rescue - they put a rescue sphere into their Type 209 subs and the whole crew can evac into it and eject themselves to the surface.<br><br>DSRVs? From my limited understanding they are useful in deeper waters........In shallow and warmer waters, you just wear an escape suit(for RN) or a hood(for USN) and pop up to the surface.  Alternatively you can use a diving bell as was trialled in the last sub rescue exercise hosted by RSN.<br><br>I tot we already got a submarine rescue facility on board MV Kendrick with a diving bell and some containerised pressure chamber from a South African diving equipment vendor?<br><br>Also remember a couple of years ago DPM Tony Tan went around the world looking to make arrangements to use their training facilities..........one interesting item is a mult-storey cylindrical pool where the submariner practises the 'popping up' routine.<br><br>Anyway here's looking to the RSN upgrading to Vastergotlands soon(fingers crossed)! <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Undoubtfully the next singapore's Naval acquisition could be a brand new submarine fleet while retaining the existing Ex-sjoormen sub training ship.The design of the new RSS submarines will be probably be modified or derive from Gotland or Viking maybe even the HDW U212.<br><br>ONe thing for definite thats the New ship will be fitted with the AIP system..<br>-------------------------------------<br><br>Its even better if singapore decides to acquire Destroyer<br>for protjection of POwer in S.E.A region</div>
