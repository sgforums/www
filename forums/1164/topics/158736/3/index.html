Equipment like these are the business of a<br>special breed of engineers from the Defence Materials Organisation, who scour the world for the best for Singapore defence. Exclusive reports by Jenny Lam on Pages Two, Three and Four.<br>THE stereotyped image of engineers as a quiet breed is shattered when one<br>deals with the Defence Materials Organisation (DMO) engineers.<br><br>"Aggressive and outgoing with strong personalities" is how the DMO director,<br>Colonel Tan Kim Siew, describes them.<br>But then, these are no ordinary engineers. They perform a highly unusual<br>hush-hush job: They scour the world for the best possible weapons and military systems to defend Singapore.<br><br>Besides having at least second class honours, they must be able to outtalk<br>and outmanoeuvre defence suppliers who "are pretty tough to deal with".<br>"We cannot have mousey, wishy-washy types and those who get pushed around, as they have to be able to get the best deals from suppliers," says 37-year-old Col Tan.<br><br>These engineers, who have to ensure that every gun, ship and plane bought is effective and safe for use by the soldiers, form the core of the DMO, which is part of the Defence Technology Group of the Ministry of Defence.<br>Armed with an annual budget of about $1 billion, DMO is responsible for<br>providing the Singapore Armed Forces with the most cost-effective military<br>systems.<br>This amount is part of the Defence Ministry's overall budget which is pegged<br>at 6 per cent of Singapore's Gross Domestic Product.<br><br>While taxpayers may raise their eyebrows at the $1 billion figure, it is<br>actually not a large sum, according to Col Tan, who has a PhD in Control<br>Engineering.<br>In an interview in his office at Paya Lebar Airport where DMO is based, he<br>says: "One billion dollars is very little because the Navy, Air Force and Army<br>all want the best and the wish-list far exceeds that amount."<br><br>Because DMO's shopping list is long, with requests ranging from uniforms to<br>communications systems and jet fighters, it "has to make sure every cent is<br>well spent and try to save as much as possible by increasingly upgrading old<br>equipment", says Col Tan.<br><strong>"Upgrading costs one third to half the cost of buying a piece of new<br>equipment. We try to use an equipment like the A4 Skyhawk to its maximum life span and then retrofit it to give it a new lease of life."<br></strong> Buying and upgrading are just two of the tasks facing the engineers. With the accumulation of expertise over the years, DMO's engineers are increasingly required to modify new purchases to suit local operational needs.<br>The group has even designed and built two new systems in conjunction with<br>defence contractors - the FH-88 Howitzer and the Navy's missile corvett........<br><br>3.U rarely see so much pages spent in Sg Defense and in Life pages.<br>Show of musles?</div>
