Total strength involved hovered around 3000 men.<br><br>The official TNI newspaper stated that the scenario of the exercise was that an"aggressor" had invaded Malaysia and hence both countries are forced to carried out punitive measures to defend Malaysia and drive the "aggressors" out.  The codename pf last phase of the exercise was translated from Behasa Melayu as "Beat to Death"<br><br>SM Goh ordered the first ever open mobilization of the SAF and the rest as they say was history.  I remember both uncles being called up at the same time for active deployment.  I think the arty one reported back to Khatib while the infantry one was deployed to Marsiling.<br></div></blockquote>if they wanted to mobilize , it would be about in about 20,000 - 50,000 men</div>

Exercise of this large scale held on the day before our national day, in Johor within visual range from Singapore mainland. It is hard for Singapore not to react.<br><br>If one day this certain country do launch an attack on us, I believe we wouldn't be on the losing end. Most of us can fire a M16 or SAR21 and had basic knowledge of military and with our technology, I believe SAF is one of the best Armed Forces in Asia. And I believe most of us had notice that Tekong's plantation has uncanny resemblence with other plantation in this certain country.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>What i meant by newer and better weapons are those that are little used and in storage such as M16S1 being used by the NS men. These weapons and equipment are less used and suffer less abuse as compared to the 'training' weapons used both in the training schools and operational units.<br><br>Ever wonder why the rifles in BMTC have seemingly more problems as compared to those in operational units? One reason is that the recruits damaged them due to being amateurs another reason is that those which they are using are the oldest in SAF's inventory.<br><br>This info is highly reliable as i got this from a 1WO.Therefore, don't get me wrong. I do not mean that what we are using in war is entirely different from what we are trained in. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>We must always remain ever vigilant,like a spring tightly wound spring,so that when push comes to shove,we will shove off with the maximum effect. The state of readiness must be so high that even the slightest provocation brings the required reaction status.It may seem that its over-reacting,but I belief,over-reacting is better then not having a reaction and sit on our asses sucking our thumbs.</div>
