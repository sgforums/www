            <div class='col-md body'><span style="color: blue;">Co-rulers? I dun think so.<br><br>Anyway, an article from </span><a href="http://cta.yam.org.tw/cta32.htm" rel="nofollow">http://cta.yam.org.tw/cta32.htm</a><br><br><blockquote><strong>Taiwan Struggling for Independence:<br>A Historical Perspective</strong><br>By Tsai Pai-chuan and Chi-ming Ng<br><br><strong>Taiwan As a Base for Japanese Southward Adventure (1895 - 1945)</strong><br><br>Â¡@ The Japanese colonization of Taiwan was divided into three periods, a coincidental reflection of the different styles of Taiwanese reactions to Japanese rule.<br><br>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br><br><strong>Armed Uprising (1895 - 1919)</strong><br><br>a).Continuing Resistance and Military Governors<br><br>Â¡@Although the Republic of Formosa had been officially terminated in October 1895, Taiwanese guerrilla resistance elements were not exterminated until May l902 when Lin Shao-mao was executed, though rebellions continued to erupt intermittently from 1907 through 1915, when Yu Ching-fan was executed.<br><br>Â¡@During this period, military governors were sent to Taiwan with absolute executive, legislative and judicial powers conferred by the Japanese Diet through the "Law No. 63." This period witnessed more than 100 uprisings in Taiwan, with 5,884 persons convicted and 4,430 of them executed in addition to tens of thousands martyred anonymously.<br><br>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br><br>b).Goto Shinpei and His Initiatives<br><br>Â¡@ Those military governors, however, laid a solid foundation for the subsequent effective Japanese colonization of Taiwan, thanks to the initiatives of Goto Shinpei, director in charge of civil affairs (1898 - 1906) at the Taiwan Governor's Office.<br><br>Â¡@On civil affairs, Goto phased in the so-called "Principle of Biology" (gradual introduction of Japanese system and culture), beginning with an extensive "investigation of the old Taiwanese customs." It was based on the results of those investigations that old Taiwanese laws and regulations were revised and new ones were enacted to pave a way for smooth Japanese colonization of Taiwan.<br><br>Â¡@On economic affairs, Goto implemented three major infrastructure projects: (i) scientific survey of flat lands for tax collection purposes, (ii) railroad construction to connect the west coast formerly separated by east-west rivers, (iii) modernization of Keelung and Kaohsiung harbors with railroad terminals.<br><br>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br><br><strong>Non-Violent Resistance (1919 - 1936)</strong><br><br>a).Â¡@ Japanese Extensionism and Civilian Governors<br><br>Â¡@Following the end of the World War I, there was a wide spread of nationalism in the Third World. For example, the eruption of the Korean independence movement in 1919 forced Japan to adopt a new policy of "Japanese extensionism" to extend her cultures to her colonies. Under such a new policy, civilian governors of Taiwan were appointed.<br><br>Â¡@Since l920, the Japanese Empire began to phase in a public policy of "Industrial Japan Proper and agricultural Taiwan" to meet the needs of the growing population in Japan. In 1930, in line with her Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere, the empire further introduced her industrial plan to satisfy the requirements of her military expansion to China and Southeast Asia, thus forcing Taiwan to play the role as a war base.<br><br>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br><br>b).First-Ever Taiwanese Civic Organizations<br><br>Â¡@ This period saw eruptions of non-violent resistance in Taiwan. The New People Association, formed in 1919 to lobby the Japan Diet for the repeal of the Law 63 and the establishment of an independent Taiwan Parliament, existed from 1920 to 1934. The Taiwanese Cultural Association was set up in l921 to send articulate intelligentsia to make itinerant speeches throughout the island to enlighten the Taiwanese. Subsequently, right-wingers of the association broke away and established the Taiwan Commoners Party in l927, the first of its kind in Taiwan. Associations established in the ensuing years included other civic organizations, such as Taiwanese Federation of Farmers Unions, Taiwanese Federation of Workers Unions, and even Taiwanese Communist Party. But those organizations were either mercilessly suppressed or banned by the Japanese colonial government. The last one that became dissolved in l937 was the Taiwanese Alliance for Local Autonomy.<br><br>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br><br><strong>Resumption of Military Rule (1936-45) </strong><br><br>Â¡@ The Taiwan Governor's Office was headed by militarists once again since l936 when the Sino-Japanese War gathered momentum. Under the Japan's "Super National Defense" and "General Mobilization" policies, Taiwan was placed in the wartime system of Japan during World War II.<br><br>Â¡@For the general mobilization purposes, the Japanese Empire, following its radical assimilation policy, forbade Taiwanese from maintaining their old customs and encouraging them to speak the Japanese language and to use Japanese-style names. In l941, a so-called "Tribute to Emperor Society" with island-wide branches was formed to enforce the assimilation policy.<br><br>Â¡@Taiwan became a source of soldiers, too. Volunteers were recruited and sent to the war effort since 1942 and a mandatory military service system was introduced in January l945, when 207,183 soldiers mobilized, 30,304 of which died in actions. World War II ended on August 15, l945 when the Japanese Emperor Hirohito announced unconditional surrender and abdicated Taiwan. Thereupon, Taiwan fell into the hands of another foreign regime, an unprecedented barbarian one in the history of Taiwan.</blockquote></div>

The Taiwanese people may be temperamental but they can match anyone's friendliness. Afterall, we're all Chinese people and we dun look down on our own people, no matter where they are.<br><br>Pride?

Lee Choon Seng, the acting Chairman of the Singapore China Relief Fund, was found dressed in monastical robe with a string of beads in his hands. Tan Ean Khiam, the acting Chairman of the Pan-South seas China Relief Fund, was in a trembling mood his sweat running down like beads. The other members included the blood-stained Lee Wee Nam, the reborn Yeo Chan Boon, and the well-dressed S. Q. Wong and Shaw Brothers. These people were taken out of goal and gathered there by a Taiwanese, named Wee Twee Kim, who donned on Japanese military uniform and carried a pistol. This was the dictator of the Oversea Chinese Association. He addressed the gathering that day and told the listeners that when the battle of Malaya started, the people of Japan held a mass meeting in Tokyo at which a resolution was passed to ask the commander in-chief of the Japanese forces attacking Malaya to exile all Chinese in Singapore to a no-manÂ’s island and starve them to death, because they were responsible for sustaining the war against Japan in China. Singapore, they insisted, was the hot-bed of the anti-Japanese elements.

Taiwan was part of china, under Ming and Qing dynasty since the dutch were driven out in 1661. 1894 Japan started the first Sino Japanese war, in China called Jia Wu Zhan zheng, in which China was defeated. As a result, China was forced to give up Taiwan, Peng Hu, and parts of north east china to Japan in the 'Ma Guan' Treaty. Taiwanese fought the Jap for several months against the jap occupation but Taiwan finally came under Japanese rule for 50 years till 1945.<br><br>Taiwan never had a choice in supporting Japan!!!<br><br>Idwar is obvious in his intention, in this and other threads, trying to flame singaporean against taiwanese. Unfortunately, he exposed himself as having no brain, low in mentaliy, poor in history, evil in his intention..........his parents either blame themselves for not teaching him or wished they had not given to him. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"></div>
