            <div class='col-md body'>Chill out!  Taiwanese people are just trying to shift their focus from China to another party, just like the other countries around S'pore.  S'pore isn't known as the "<strong>whipping boy</strong>" for nothing.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br><br>The Taiwanese people do not consider themselves any superior to S'pore or Hong Kong.  But their government do consider themselves as the unoffical 57 state of America.  Not that America actually gives a shit about it.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_twisted.gif" alt="Twisted Evil" title="Twisted Evil"><br><br>BTW, if anyone is thinking, the U.S military is not likely to aid Taiwan should Taiwan decide to launch a pre-emp against China.  Taiwan is not Israel, China is not Afghanistan or Iraq.  Even if Bush remains the next 4years as President, he won't be able to convince any American to fight another war using Terrorism as an excuse.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_neutral.gif" alt="Neutral" title="Neutral"></div>

This discussion is just as insensitive as discussion on comfort women. If this is interesting, may be you should find out who were those who worked for the Brit before independence and find out how well they served their colonial master in handling local singaporean. May be those who served thought they were more superior than other singaporean.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I don't see what's there to be proud of and how they are more superior to others since they're all the same. If your argument is valid then maybe the Germans are truly the master race of this earth.<br><br>Furthermore, having 5000 missles and countless howitzers aimed at their homes, as compared to 50 miserable guns pointing at ours, and only five countries willing to (monetary) acknowledge their diplomatic existence. I hardly count that as being in a superior position.</div>

And they are also spoiling for a fight with the US as they can't stand the US arrogance.<br><br>Of the Taiwanese I've met, some are pro-independent and some are actually keen to be re-unified with China for reasons of culture and history and also practicality. They are sick of Taiwan's grey position in the world as being the "illegitimate" China.
