            <div class='col-md body'>Wouldn't have changed much if China wasn't also embroiled in a civil war.<br><br>Japan at the late 1930's was a super war machine. They were so advanced that they trained a lot of Chinese Nationalist officers before they decided to invade China.<br><br>In terms of technology, just imagined: Only the US, Britain and Japan operated aircraft carriers in WW2. That's how far ahead in doctrinal thinking they were.<br><br>They were dedicated, highly-skilled and fanatical.<br><br>Even without the civil war, both Communist and Nationalist troops were badly-trained and mostly badly-armed, poorly-led and not motivated.<br><br>The Nationalist commanders were mostly inept as cronyism guaranteed promotion over capabilties. Chiang Kai-shek himself is a tyrant and should be tried for incompetence, appeasing the Japs, killing almost as many Chinese people (suspected communists) as the Japs, and for being very willing to sacrifice his own troops.<br><br>Although there were some very capable commanders these are too few to make an impact.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I agree with what TvDog had said earlier.<br><br>Here is my add on.<br><br>The emperor at that time in Japan is a highly ambitious man who his wish was to rule the world by himself, that create a strong, loyal imperial army that is willing to sacrifice willingly for his country at any point in time. On the other hand, China itself has been very poor after several revolutionary eras, where there are a severely lack of food and amenities as well as many are illiterate and were not really aware what was going on beyond their countries.<br><br>The invasion by the Japanese was well planned and prepared. Early before they set their army on the land in China, they had already infiltrate many spies to the country.<br><br>Most important, the Chinese counterpart is totally unprepared for the war.<br><br>Therefore, even without the civil war among communities and nationalist, China is too weak to defend themselves at that time, with lack good commanders and highly motivate soldiers.<br><br>In actual fact, many Chinese soldiers disappointedly surrendered themselves even without a fight with their enemies due to shortage of ammunitions, food, medicine resources.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>One thing to remember was that though China suffered horrifically, Japan did not succeed in "officially" occupying China in the way they occupied Singapore and Malaysia.<br><br>In other words, China did not capitulate in the way the Brits did in Singapore or like the French (in France) etc.<br><br>Though the Japs did install a puppet regime with Puyi etc the Nationalist and Communist forces remained inside China throughout the war. Chiang-Kai Shek and Mao both remained in China throughout the war and did not flee the country. Their respective armies remained viable (but weak) fighting forces throughout the war.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Japanese are over-rated simply because the victories that they won in early part of the war is due to:<br>1) lack of determinations from the Chinese Nationalist armies. The Chinese generals were more inclinded to enter into a peace treaty with Jap just like the Song Dynasty sue for peace with the Northern Liao Kingom / Jin Kingdom.<br><br>2) Nationalist armies did not view Jap as their top enemies. They hated the Chinese communists more than the Jap.<br><br>3) Nationalist armies are very poorly armed. The tactics were mostly world war I tactics involving Static Defences in trenches, mass infantry charges. Their lack of modern arms eg tanks, anti-tank guns and even rapid fire machine guns had greatly affect the fighting capability against the Jap.<br><br>4) Jap early success in Pacific War is due to the pre-occupied european colonial masters were busy fighting for the survival back home against Germany. The British, french and Dutch armed forces were all tied up in Europe. Thus, the British did not even bother to reinforce the Singapore /Malaya as they could only spare 2 battleships to SE Asia. No tanks no top-of-line Spitefire / Hurricane from British India.<br><br>5) In the 1939 Manchurian- Mongolian border conflicts, the Jap armed forces elite troops (Guan Dong Jun) was defeated by the Russian Red Armies, even the Jap had threw in their best Zero Fighters to provide air cover.<br><br>6) Throughout the occupation of Singapore / Malaya, the Jap Imperial Armies did not managed to root out the Malaya Communist Ant-Jap Armies in the Peninsula. In fact, the resistances were controlling most of the rural area and Jap control was mainly confined to huge urban area.<br><br>7) Jap armies did not managed to chase the British out of India, as the British was well established in the India. The British had a large army and a air force in India.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>please don't flame me for this...<br><br>but there are many stories "commonly believed" by the masses in Rape of Nanking that 100% of atrocities are done by the Japanese Army.<br><br>I did read a more critical article elsewhere about researchers looking into Iris Chiangs books and other chinese history book.<br><br>They said that while Japanese Army did do some atrocities, the chinese side (both Nationalist and Communists) had their fair share.<br><br>There are areas in China during that time where Japanese army had to protect the civilians from the Chinese.<br><br>The Japanese had to evacuate the villagers and Japanese army had to escort them out. Photopgraphs taken during these times were then used to mislead people that japanese army were escorting them to their deaths.<br><br>Such cases are where that locality either are pro-japanese or live in such poverty that Japanese are supplying them with food more so during the Civil war time. Why the Chinese are doing harm to them is more for "teaching them a lesson" or making them submit to their ideology.<br><br>The communist and nationalist armies also plunder their locals for supplies.<br><br>No one i have told believe in me and some actually got disgusted that i was defending the Japanese.<br><br>For me, i am defending facts. Well, there is little or little support for what I have read, I also tend to believe the the current belief in Rape of Nanking is also done by overrating the atrocities done.<br></div>
