            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by tvdog:</div><div class="quote_body">Wow...<br><br>China is maybe ten times the size of Japan. It is probably about the size of Europe. So inveitably, distance leads to differences, and differences sometimes lead to conflict.<br><br>People in Guangzhou, for example, are very different from people in, say Beijing. They look different, have different statures, complexions, behave differently, wear different clothes and even eat different types of noodles. They speak dialects incomprehensible to each other. It's just like comparing different Europeans like French and Italians.<br><br>And the Europeans never stopped fighting amonst themselves either.<br><br>Compared to China, Japan is a small island nation. And they had been fighting amonst themselves for a VERY LONG time until the Meiji era or something where one Shogun (warlord) defeated and united the whole Japan. China was the same but because of her size, took a longer time to sort things out. The Koreans, erm... aren't they still separated after last fighting a war sixty years ago?<br><br>But China is one people and today, one nation again.<br><br>Chinese people have a long history of civilisation, science, culture and innovation and many other good values. It would take 100 times more pages to list the good things about Chinese culture than the bad things.<br><br>China, Chinese, are not perfect. Neither are the Japanese or the Koreans or any race for that matter. But I'm not here to dis other cultures.<br><br>It is unfortunate that the Chinese blood in you only gave you gluttony. What other blood run in you? Whatever it is it can't be good blood either cos it gave you ignorance, stupidity and bigottry.<br><br>Your knowledge of Asian history is pathetic and you cannot see beyond the tip of your nose. It is ironic that you are ashamed of your Chinese blood cos I'm sure most Chinese people will be very ashamed of you, too. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"> </div></blockquote>Dude, seriously, I think its you who have shown lack of knowledge in Chinese history. At the rate you are going, I would have thought you meant Chinese dont like each other because of geographical/ethnic disparity, like Romans vs Gauls, West Germans vs East Germans. Havent even mixing with Chinese for the past decades in your life tells you two common characteristics about Chinese?<br><br>Besides greed for material riches, two things I find consistent in Chinese are pride and wanting of power.<br><br>If you have been reading Chinese history, one word that always come out is 'hegemony' or 'tong yi tian xia'. Spring and Autumn Period and the Warring States best exemplify this drive for power and control. They started when feudal lords each decided that they wanted power, leading to break up of the Zhou into hundreds of warring states, and then fought until the last seven before being unified by Qin Shi Huang<br><br>Three Kingdoms also reflect this hegemony concept, when Cao Cao seized power from the Lius, and even before the three kingdoms, there were numerous other warlords, including Dong Zhuo, Liu Biao and Yuan Shu.<br><br>Heard of 4 centuries of  Northern and Southern Dynasties before Sui finally conquer them all? How about Five Dynasties after the Tangs?<br><br>Is there significant amount of hatred because of geographical origin? Using talent overcome this, leading to the Zhuge brothers serving three different states. Liu Bei sought to restore the Han Dynasty, not just simply because he dont like Cao Cao's face.<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br></div>

The Germans rescued survivors after sinking a ship they mistakenly thought it is a ship engaged in military operations. This was a common understanding and practice carried out by both sides until one American plane bombed the very German ship with the rescued survivors.<br><br>From then on, the Germans will abandon all survivors as they see no point risking their ships rescuing people. But how did history portray them? They are usually unfairly portrayed as vicious people who will machine gun survivors after sinking their ships. But what's do these people know what the root of it was?<br><br>As for Jap troops posing with naked women. Yes, i don't deny that happened.<br>And that's common history.<br><br>But do you know at the same time these Japanese atrocities are happening, the Nationalist and Communists factions are doing it to their OWN race simply because they choose the opposition ideology.<br><br>Do you know General Yamashida (if i spell it correctly, the forum will "encrypt" it to take out something vulgar) executes his own officers if they ever harm local population? But history was so mixed up that people believe General Yamashida was in Singapore all along, believing that Yamashida was responsible for all the wrongdoings that ever happened in Singapore.<br><br>So i just want to make it clear that I am not righting a wrong or denying history. But I just want to let you all know that whatever history we learn today we have to be cautious before making any judgements. There are many incidents done by both sides of war that are questionable and some are commendable.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>There waqs no doubt that there were good and decent Jap army officers who really worship and practice the Bushido spirit.<br><br>But sad to say, a large majorities of Jap officers in the WW2 were acting more like their gangsters or hooligans... Jap armies is not really disciplined and humane as compared to the British Imperial Army. A large pool of Jap citizens also throught that Jap people were victims until now, but they did not relaise that they are deceived by their own gov until now.</div>
