Man the Prince of Wales was a jinx!<br><br>Actually some of the local soldiers fought well and bravely despite their equipment.

            <div class='col-md body'>Can see a lot of our northern neighbour and fellow countrymen of the south are in this forum, very busy discussing the likehood of a hostile outbreak btw the 2 countries. This event is very remote as long as the leadership of both countries are in the hands of men with talents (or at least right minds).<br><br>If one day, some racial extremists (Chinese extremist, Indian exmistrist or Malay extremist) taken over one of the country in this region, we will not find peace and stability. I believe a lot of us treasure the time and opporunity for us to share our views here under a peaceful atmosphere.<br><br>I hope all of us would contribute our strength, regardless of our race and faith, to fight the true evil of extremism that may take its forms from racism to terrorism. Frankly speaking, I dun think any man with a sound mind would want a war btw 2 neighbours. We have a deep common roots and culture. We have suffered and prosperous together,  and we share the similiar fate in the river of history. The 2 countries may be in different stage of developement under different policy and different leaderships, but deep down we are closely knitted and bonded by blood ties across the straits. It is inevitable that there will be some fiction between 2 countries. But we should always treasure our ties with each other.<br><br>Just remember WW2, when Malaysia fall, Sg fall. Just look at the more recent Asian Crisis, when Malaysia and Indo fall, Sg also suffer. There is no reason for Sg to want Malaysia to fail in her modernization effort, Sg will only prosper when her neighbours prosper. Chinese saying "Got money, we earn together!".</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>That is why from WW2 lessons, we can summarise few points:<br><br>1) Air force very very important.<br>Jap planes are unchallenged after 24 hours of the 1st air raid. They bomb the hell out of british command. Worst still, jap can bomb the reserivor, power plant, supply depot, telephone station, camps and hospitals anywhere they like. In this way, it detract the recovery effort and send the british commanders busy hiding and running, rather than focus on the war in Malaysia.<br><br>With control of air, Jap can use airforce to sink the 2 great battleships and perform a Pearl Harbour for the US navy. It opened another dimension for attacking your enemies.<br><br>2) Arty and Armour very important.<br>Art can shell and pin down your enemy in trenches, while u perform the franking movement. It also destroy the morale of the enemies troops.<br><br>Armour thrust is most effective against heavily fortified british lines. More importantly, armour can act as mobile support gun for infantry attacks, or hold off the high ground. Jap even managed to squeeze their armour force through the dense SE Asia forestation and give a pleasant surprise fopr our Ang Mo commander.<br><br>3) Communication, Logisitic and Standardization<br>Weapons and training of the field troops must be standardize to every basic step of fighting. The troopers and commanders must speak and understand a common language. The communication btw the troops and commanders must be free and open at all time in the war, so that the commanders could make the best decision and the troopers could minimise the causalities in the conflicts.<br><br>Allied divisions and different army grouos should have standardised equipments and training to impove on inter-operateability and synergised - combined armed division concept or Air - Land warfare concept.<br><br>4) Nation identity buiding<br>In WW2, only a fraction of allied troops fighting are locals. Thus, the allied troops are not fighting as bravely as many expected. But the Chinese Vol and malay regiments were much more brave and delicated compare to their ang mo peers. Of course, Aust unit had fought very bravely to the bitter end as well. If the local british commander is determined to fight a Iraqi style of urban war with Jap, the out come for the Invasion of Malaya would be entirely different. At least, the Jap with limited supplies and exhausted troops would be seriously challenged by the numerically superior Allied troops in street fighting. The Jap armour, airforce and navy advantages would be useless in close combant in build-up area.<br><br>Maybe with luck, British carriers, that stopped in India for modification, could be deployed against the jap in conjunction with the Allied Fleets in SE Asia.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Things to note though:<br><br>Jap tanks were small. they wont be more then the size of half tracks then the likes of the Pzkwfg 3,4 or 5.<br><br>Heck they looked more like the CharB and them Skoda's then anything else hah.<br><br>Actually it was the rapid speed of movement by the japs via the use of canoes and bikes that stunned the brits more then the tanks. The brits kept having their lines turned by japs on bikes and canoes moving so rapidly they could hardly retreat in time.<br><br>The Ang Moh troops were mainly british,Aust and Nz troops. And truth be told they performed way way way better then most of the allied troops. In fact other then certain Malay regiments and Chinese regiments, the rest of the volunteers performed pretty damn badly if i recall correctly.<br><br>The British SEA commander should have been more insistant in implementing orders to the Singapore garrison commander then he was. Considering that the guy in charge of the Singapore garrison was rather indecieve.<br><br>I honestly think street fighting with the japs would be bad. REALLY REALLY bad. Why? Imagine this, you ambush and kill a Jap patrol, they move in and kill a village. 10 japs for 30 civs. Some of which will be your family. Would you want that?<br><br>We're not talking about people who bloody care like the western troops whom these tactics are being used againest. Heck some SS units were better then these guys.<br><br>Tell me, do you really want to take the japs on in street fighting??<br><br>The British Carriers if i'm not wrong did deploy later for coral sea. But they were pretty small carriers anyway.</div>
