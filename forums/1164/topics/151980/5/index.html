The destruction of all Allied air assets in the air and on the ground. Also the sinking of more shipping especially those carrying soldiers and civilians fleeing Singapore.<br><br>During the actual fighting in the jungles, Jap aircraft did carry out a lot of sorties on Allied ground troops. In one case they dropped a bomb square on a Allied infantry field HQ killing many officers. But these were not in any way instrumental in the Allies' eventual defeat in the ground war, were they? It wasn't aircraft strikes that the Allied ground troops were running away from.<br><br>The determining factor in the ground war was still the Jap troop's fighting skills and determination.<br><br>Hell, it was not even the tanks as one book I read said that the tanks were badly used by the Japs. They were sometimes used without infantry support. I read one instance where a lone Australian anti-tank gun knocked out 6 Jap tanks driving round a road bend one at a time. This gun fought on until destroyed or ran out of ammo. The gunner survived, while his mates were killed off, i think.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>As a matter of fact, Jap soldiers are not as deadly as many believed. Jap soldiers appeared deadly, because they striked fear into the heart of their enemies by performing beheading enemies and slaughtering civilians. As a result, many poorly trained soldiers fled or surrendered when they faced off with jap infantry.<br><br>It was often noted that Jap patrols were only confined to the city area where they had sufficient back-up. The rest of villgaes were under the control of the Anti jap elements. The Jap armies were regularly attacked / ambushed by these freedom fighters throughout the 3years and 8mth.<br><br></div>
