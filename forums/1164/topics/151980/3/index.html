Some singaproeans are way too arrogant.<br><br>I do believe that we are militarily stronger than them, but the margin isn't much. Over the past 15 years, on average our defence budget is like 1.5 to 1.67 times that of Malaysia's.<br><br>From this figure, it is not hard to see that Singapore's superiority is minor, not that huge. Although we may be more efficient than them in using money, that still does not give us much of an edge.<br><br>If you look at the number of tanks we have as compared to say Taiwan or Yugoslavia, we are not really that good. There are many countries in the world that are ahead of us.<br><br>So overall, we are indeed stronger than Malaysia, but the difference is a small one, such that it is not sufficient to ensure military success in the event war breaks out.</div></blockquote>The Chinese says "jiao bing bi bai". Arrogant soldiers will lose the war. Even if they have the advantage in all aspects.<br><br>Singaporean must be aware that we have been referred to as little red dot, and our sovereignty and territory have been challenged time and again.<br><br>We need to be confident that we will win to stand firm in safeguarding our interests. We have the reason to be confident and such confidence should not be taken as arrogance.<br><br></div>

But the British was over confident of thier Sole navel Battleship and expected a Naval assault hence replacing ALL thier AA guns.. thus succumbed to devastating airial assault and also didnt anticipate the Japs to come down so fast on thier asses. I forgot whats the name of the Battle ship that guarded Sg but it was an embarrasment to the British navy.. just like the HMS Hood.. sunk by the Bismarck with a direct hit to thier unprotected Ammo storage.. Coup De Grace  =P</div>
