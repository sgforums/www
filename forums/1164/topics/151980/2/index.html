            <div class='col-md body'>Actually I am all for true meritocracy in all aspects of the country most notably SAF. We must acknowledge the fact that racial discrimmination do exist in the SAF just like in all other levels of the country. However, it is very heartening to know that this exist at a very low level. In fact we have one of the best racially harmonious society in the world for racially diversified countries. I hope that SAF will give our Malay brothers more chances to go to certain units/formations. Maybe not immediately but speed up the process as it is already happening.<br><br>Ok, from all the posts above we can safely say that we can trust our Malay brothers to fight with us against other malays during war. They have no problem with race during a national crisis. However, what about religion? Will our muslim brothers have problems squeezing the trigger with a fellow muslim in the crosshair? If we can overcome these racial and religious differences and be united in Singapore, then we will be formidable! Unity is strength! Hope to hear views and comments from different races and religion.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"></div>

We eat the same food and it's very hard to even tell the difference between the Singlish that we speak and the "Malaysia-glish" that they speak. This is especially true when you are in a foreign country and you hear someone speaking like us. But upon a friendly enquiry "Singaporeans is it?" they might proudly announce "No, Malaysians lah."<br><br>But still, war with Malaysia remains very possible. I'm sure no one fails to notice that nearly ALL wars are fought between neighbouring countries. I mean you have to be near enough to wallop each other, right? Of course there are exceptional cases like US-Iraq Gulf War. Otherwise, it is always neighbour on neighbour.<br><br>Even in WW2, Germany and Japan first started the nonsense with their neighbours.<br><br>Malaysia doesn't buy a single Singapore-manufactured weapon or ordnance to my knowledge. Or maybe Singapore doesn't offer to sell weapons and ammo to Malaysia. Anyone knows why?<br><br>Whereas Indonesia, Philippines and Burma have all purchased ST goodies. I think this is a sign that Malaysia - maybe to a very small extent - does prepare for war with Singapore. Or maybe it's just pride on the Malaysian side.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>We shouldn't think along the lines of "we'll definitely beat Malaysia in the event of a war". Some singaproeans are way too arrogant.<br><br>I do believe that we are militarily stronger than them, but the margin isn't much. Over the past 15 years, on average our defence budget is like 1.5 to 1.67 times that of Malaysia's.<br><br>From this figure, it is not hard to see that Singapore's superiority is minor, not that huge. Although we may be more efficient than them in using money, that still does not give us much of an edge.<br><br>If you look at the number of tanks we have as compared to say Taiwan or Yugoslavia, we are not really that good. There are many countries in the world that are ahead of us.<br><br>So overall, we are indeed stronger than Malaysia, but the difference is a small one, such that it is not sufficient to ensure military success in the event war breaks out.</div>

Eg Consulted Singapore regarding a possible AH-64D Attack Helo purchase (4 - 6 units) from the United States.</div>
