            <div class='col-md body'>I am very interested in these 3 nations' arms program for the next 5 years. Anybody have a good report on their Army programs?<br><br>Here's what I found about the 3 nations' Navy programs. In terms of numbers, it's not really an expansion. But in term of quality, I think it's a quantum jump for some of these platforms, eg Japan's heli destoyer &amp; ROK's LX-P which are essentially light aircraft carrier.<br><br>ROK seems to have the smallest fleet.

            <div class='col-md body'>That could be a very big talk!   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br>To make the talk straightened, letÂ’s 1st round out S.korea, because, it got weaker power and S.koreaÂ’s standing is more neutral, actually, IMO, the F15K is more a threat towards japan than china, Because, Japan donÂ’t enjoy the defense depth that China prevails, and also, if China being struck by S.koreaÂ’s F15K, it can easily knock out the airfield where the F15K launched by using all kinds of missiles including cruise missiles which japan lacks.<br><br>So regarding Japan and China, the topic becomes more realistic. On paper, Japan got better Navy because it has more and better surface ships! But think again, letÂ’s see what currently happened at the hotspot (again where got oil) in East China Sea. The China side already start drilling oil without any funfair talk ( we only see Japan makes a lot of noise if u turn to the news tonight), only the PLAN vessels are around the scene instead of Japs more high flied 9.10 fleet. How come a country with supposed to be more powerful navy got weaker politic demanding, DonÂ’t talk to me because somebody is more civil or polite such kind of story. Because the thinking Japs got better surface navy then is more powerful is wrong.<br><br>9.10 fleet yes got better airdefense than any PLAN fleet at the time being, however, Japs SDFÂ’s antiship projection is mainly only relied on Harpoon ASM launched from navy vessels and their airborne Harpoon capability is very poor( F15J canÂ’t shoot ASM).<br><br>The harpoon Anitship missile itself is not so advanced compared to many supersonic/longer range ASM in PLAÂ’s inventory. The US Navy use Harpoon very simple. Their ship borne F/A18s just shoot ur fleet use huge amount of Harpoons at the same time to saturate your fleet air defense.<br><br>Then letÂ’s c what going to happen if the japs 9.10 fleet at the conflict spot really encounters PLA force.<br><br>The PLA will use the same tactics that US navy CV groups are applying: many long haul land based Su30/JH-7 heavy fighter bombers will launch standoff missile attacks towards the fleet. At a full load anti-ship config.  ItÂ’s said, a PLA 1st class Naval Aviation Regiment can shoot 400-500 ASM simultaneously. So no matter how strong the 9.10 fleet is, it just canÂ’t stand such a saturated attack. In real practice, the PLA most likely will mix their Antiship missile like YJ83/K59A with their anti-radiation missiles like YJ91/ K31 etc. making the punch more deadly.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>The J10 is a potent weapon platform that could seriously upset the air power balance in Far East. If you are familiar with the F16 development history, u would know that the Isrealis came up with designing a low cost plane Lavi using F16 design technologies in late 1970 to early 1980. But there is one major different, the Lavi has a canard and delta wings just like the F16XL that USAF was evaluating against F15E.<br><br>Now we know that Lavi was technical a success as the flight characteristic was good. We even know that F16XL was even a greater success, the detailed is available in the following site below.<br><br>http://www.f-16.net/f-16_versions_article1.htm<br><br>Thus, it is not hard to imagine how good the J10 flight characteristic. J10 would be a unstable airframe. In mid to late 1990s, the chinese fly-by-wire tech had been refined from both Soviet and Isreal help since the 2nd J10 prototype crashed in the test flight.  The Chinese has been very tight lipped in J10, instead they chose to publicize the JF17. The JF17 is a good airframe which is a entry level for today air superiority role. Thus, the true capability of J10 (early version), with russian fine-tuning, would at least match the F16 Block 50. Radar, fire control system, ECM and on-board flight computer are the few advantages that US F16 now.</div>
