            <div class='col-md body'>After doing some research, it seems to be otherwise. The first 2 battalions of Marines came into being on November 10, 1775.  They were to serve as landing forces with the fleet.  They were known as the Continental Marines.  However there was no mention to exactly who the Marines were in service of.  However, what is known is that the term US Army did not exist at that time and technically neither did the US Navy during the time it was created.  IMO, since they were the landing forces OF the fleet, that would mean they are part of the fleet.<br><br>It is interesting to note that they do operate under Army Rank though.  They ranks such as "major" and not "commander'.<br><br>What really makes the Marines part of the navy are the traditions they have ever since the founding.  They use terminology that are very "nautica".  Terms such as "Aye."  "Bulkheads" for walls, "overheads" for ceilings, and "deck" for floors."   Terminology which are typically navy.<br><br>I do believe that the USMC began as Naval infantry.</div>
