But I know for certain the Israeli military won't take in non-jews.<br><br>The thing is, except for the French Foreign Legion, you've to be a citizern of the country inorder to join the military proper.  Otherwise, you'll be assigned to non-combatives duties.  This means that you can't have 2 citizernship.<br><br>Hmm! I don't think you can join a foreign military just for the purpose of experience &amp; then returned to your country of origin to serve back in its military.  The foreign military can prosecute you as a spy, while your own country military can't trust you.  Also, theres the age factor involve.  When you join a foreign military, example, U.S Marines, you'll have to go through the basic trainning even though you've done it in your own country military.  After basic trainning, you'll have to see which unit you'll be assigned to.  Then you've to go through advance trainning in the unit you are assigned to before you can be certified as combat ready.  So by the time you've finished your tour of duties with the Marines, I don't think you'll want to wear another unifor again.  It can be quite depressing.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_neutral.gif" alt="Neutral" title="Neutral"></div>

Besides, S'pore army is a defensive force not an offensive force.  Then theres the question of government responsibilities if a S'pore soldier is killed while fighting for a foreign country's domestic problem.  Is it the S'pore government responsibility or the country in which the soldier fought in responsibility?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_question.gif" alt="Question" title="Question"><br><br>I understand that S'pore had a detachment sent to East Timor sometime back.  That was on behalf of the U.N security council which meant that had a S'pore soldier been killed in East Timor, 3/4 of the responsibility would be covered by the U.N security council while the remaining 1/4 responsibility belong to the S'pore government. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>If S'pore government wants to volunteer its forces, like Japan's forces in Iraq, it'll have to bear the entire responsibilities of its forces in combat.<br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_neutral.gif" alt="Neutral" title="Neutral"><br><br>But isn't it true that S'pore does have foreign troops visiting quite offen for trainning?  Isn't that as much an exchange of military experience?  I remember there were S'pore troops going to Haiwai to train with the U.S MARINEs.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"></div>
