            <div class='col-md body'>Why Hitler lost the war<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Western Front</span><br><br>1#  Only defensible sector was Normandy, No other places to defend well as Hitler believed a back-up plan is a excuse to retreat<br><br>Singapore's case: We get attack we all hide in fort canning or sentosa?<br><br>2#  While retreating from the Ostfront, Many tanks were lost while the 500,000 strong 7th Army or something was wiped out or captured<br><br>Singapore's case: We have 350 tanks, Wouldn't that be a hindrance while retreating?<br><br>3# Singapore is too small and all fronts must be protected or the enemy will roll into singapore like how Erwin Rommel rolled into the Ardennes with minimum loss and captured of dozens of French Battalions.<br><br>Singapore's case: If all fronts protected, Like what Rommel noticed in North Africa, The fronts of British were too sparsely occupied. Thus singapore too many fronts also die, Too little also die.<br><br>4#  Ostfront, Germans rolled into Russia too quickly such that 100,000 of Russians were behind their lines and their lines were thin and wide<br><br>Singapore's case: What if people attack from the south? Those sentosa cannons aren't gonna do freak<br><br>5#  Germans had a strong airforce in the Luftwaffe while their submarines sunk too many british ships<br><br>Singapore's case: How many capital ships do we have? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br>6#  Germany took over France and Belgium too quickly was because, Their motorized division led by Erwin Rommel adopted a new strategy which the world never seen before which led to whole French battalions surrendering even before a single shot was fired<br><br>Singapore's case: Follow what is taught by Australia, British and US officers, Note, They definitely have counters to those tactics<br><br>7#  Erwin Rommel destroyed the British lines when he landed in Africa with only a quarter of his Afrika Corps, He acted accordingly and defied clear orders not to attacked by the Supreme Command<br><br>Singapore's case: Disobey order = Die<br><br>So many things to learn.. In order for singapore to survive, Besides money.. WE need people who can think of strategy themselves AND a change to martial law is definitely a must</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Number One doesnt sound right<br><br>Calais is the defensible sector, and the Allies had been wanting to aim for Normand, Hitler's weakest link, therefore begin to spread a lot of misinformation about them wanting to hit Calais<br><br>Its like when the Japanese arrived at Johor Baru, they wanted to cross over the western coast to Tengah since the breadth of the Straits is the shortest there, but created a diversion by pounding Pulau Ubin with mortars<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Number Three doesnt sound right either<br><br>Its not about front, but about mobility of army. Hitler proved the uselessness of static defence, which he can simply overrun with his very mobile armies. Or you can always try some other useful strategies, like Dorgen using Wu Sangui to open the Great Wall's gate.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hitler's main mistakes is that he is a suspected gay, who meddled too much in how the war is fought. German officers are the best in the world.. (etc..Rommel) and hitler ride them into follies.

            <div class='col-md body'>One of the core strengths of the German Army was its leadership to men ratio.  It was significantly higher compared to the allies. I can't remember it off hand, but i'm sure something will turn up quickly through a web crawl.<br><br>I'm not saying that we are "Fortress Singapore."  Just that an invasion force will have too much to contend with.  The first front being the Intelligence Battle. Its very HARD to hide a major force build up.<br><br>Another of Hitler's mistake was overconfidence in the "blitzkrieg."<br>1. The blitzkrieg is over rated.  It was an excellent tactic when numerically superior, technologically superior, as it prevented the enemy from massing enough firepower to slow the advancing armor.  Airpower is a MUST.  Against a technologically equivalent allied army, with lesser tanks than the allies, the Blitzkrieg failed him.<br><br>2. Hitler's personal meddling in Tank design, that resulted in the monstrosity called the KingTiger and its predecessor, the Tiger, added the final nail into the blitzkrieg coffin.  The hideously slow and ultra heavy tank could not keep up with blitzkrieg style tempo of ops.  Firstly, its a gas sucker, and too heavy for the terrain they were supposed to operate in.<br><br>3. Hitler's lack of confidence in his commanders, and the German Army's capability to fight defensive battles.  The German's were experts at defensive operations.  They were extremely organised and more than capable of slowing and inflicting casualties on a defensive fight.  He failed to allow his commanders to conduct defensive battles in depth, instead ordering them to counter-attack (blitzkrieg style, yes)  whenever the opportunity arose.  Fear of the secret police saw to it that the commanders obeyed that order.<br><br>Finally, I believed if Hitler allowed Rommel to position armor behind normandy, the allies could not have gotten a beach head at all. They would have been counter attacked immediately on the beach.  Instead, armor was positioned more centrally, in a more conservative bet that they would be able to counter-attack against any location the Allies chose to land.  He should have gambled with the DesertFox.<br><br></div>

On the northern shores,most of the defences was centered around calsis.Which is the closest point to England and also a port which Hitler believed was needed.<br><br>Many tanks were lost from the retreat mainly due to the fact that they could not be supplied with sufficient fuel.<br><br>Rommel was but 1 of many generals who took part in the invasion of france. While he did good, many other generals did just as well if not better. Also it helped that the french only had some 3 division in that area. Infantry divisions at that. To stand up againest a corp of germans.(if i remember the numbers correctly)They also did not really have the ability to defend againest tanks. It is however interesting to note that quility and quantity wise, the french had the advantage.<br><br>The british forces in Africa was totally horribly commanded.And while they had better troops their tank force wasnt that good. I believe the mK4's and tigers were better then the matilda's and cruiser tanks.<br><br>Alright now to address Shotgun's points.<br>number 1 is quite wrong.As i've mentioned above, the French had better and more tanks during the invasion.But they still lost. Mainly due to leadership and the fact that the french did not have a general plan or even much of a general staff. Heh dumb frenchies didnt learn from the humiliation that was the Franco-Prussian war.<br><br>Points 2 and 3 are valid and true.<br><br>Point 4.....well the Germans did have armour. Infact they had 2 SS divisions in that area. They were the legendary 1st SS LAH and the 2 SS HJ and the 9th SS(wiking i believe). Also in the area was the guys of the crack 7th FJ(paras),the 17 SS panzergrendier,Panzer-Lehr division and elements of 6 army armoured divs(2,21,116 and 11)<br>Of which the 1st SS and 2nd SS and the 17th SS were deployed near normany. In fact the recon and advance guard of the 17th SS did take part in the fighting.<br>The problem was that that of command structure. The SS divisions were NOT under the army command thus placing them in direct contorl of Rommel. They were under command of Hitler himself. So all orders for them had to go through him.

Big guns need big ship sizes, requiring more manpower and assets to safeguard. The <span style="font-style: italic;">Tirpitz </span>was virtually useless given the High Command's morbid fear of losing it and lowering troop morale after the sinking of the <span style="font-style: italic;">Bismark</span>.

In a rough break down of aircraft type, French Curtis 75A fighters downed 33 german fighters and lost 3 of their own. MS406s, downed 31 luftwaffe, while losing 6, Bloch 152 equipped units downed 156 Luftwaffe planes while losing 59, and Dewoitine 520 units shot down 175 Luftwaffe aircraft, while losing 44.<br><br>The Kill Lost ratio was clearly in favor of the french. How long can the Luftwaffe sustain this kinda kill lost ratio, given their high sortie rate. Comparing to the French 1-2 sortie per day, and the Luftwaffe 3-4 sortie.  Problem with the French air force then, was that they were "not around."  They were based far from the front, while the Luftwaffe aircraft were just about half an hour from their targets.<br><br>As for the RAF, they deployed 12 out of 40 operational squadrons, while the French, only deployed 580 of their 2200 aircraft. Out numbered? Only by sortie rate, and lack of resolve.<br><br>French Tanks were not obsolete. The French Souma S35 Tank, was faster, more heavily armored and its 47mm gun could disable any German vehicle. There were 400 produced, as compared to 381 of the inferior German Mark3s. As for MBTs, the B1 was a formidable opponent on the battlefield.  It had no rival except for the 88mm anti aircraft guns that were pressed into anti tank service.<br><br>The Qty of the tanks the french had was also very impressive.  1200 R35 light tanks, 695 H35 light tanks, 200 D1 and D2 medium tanks, 285 soumas, and 175 B1 Tanks. Adding to that, another 3000 over FT tanks, and 400 "tankettes."<br><br>Now here comes the best part.  More than 338000 men of the BEF, and 139000 French troops evacuated at dunkirk.  The British, left behind 2400 guns, 63000 vehicles.  Add those vehicles and AT guns to the already French Armored force, and not forgetting the Belgians.

They kept mostly to the roads and attacked without infantry support. The only reason they prevailed was the dire shortage of anti-tank guns and ammo. Otherwise they were easily defeated. One Australian anti-tank crew killed six tanks coming round a bend in the road without any infantry protection. Then the Aussies ran out of ammo.</div>
