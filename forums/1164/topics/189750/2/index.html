            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by tvdog:</div><div class="quote_body">Yes, it is well recirded that at the beginning of Blitzkreig, the French had better tanks than the Germans, who had mostly Panzers mark 1 &amp; 2's. These are fast but lightly armed and lightly armoured. But Hitler used them as part of a infantry/armour strike force supported by airstrikes. So the quality of the tanks itself was secondary. The combined air/land tactics and the willpower was what really won.<br><br>The French used the tanks poorly, I read. So their thick armour and bigger guns were wasted.<br><br>The defeat of the Allies in Europe, as well as the defeat of the Allies by Japan in Asia - namely Singapore - is nearly identical. Similarly, a smaller but well-led and well-motivated strike force was able to "Blitzkreig" a large and well-armed defending army.<br><br>Yes, the Japs had tanks, but they used their tanks poorly. They kept mostly to the roads and attacked without infantry support. The only reason they prevailed was the dire shortage of anti-tank guns and ammo. Otherwise they were easily defeated. One Australian anti-tank crew killed six tanks coming round a bend in the road without any infantry protection. Then the Aussies ran out of ammo.</div></blockquote>I'm not sure if the French were such poor users of tanks as they are made out to be.  The German 3rd and 4th armored division lost more than 150 vehicles , while the French lost more than a 100 of their own.  And that was while the French Calvary Corps was vastly outnumbered.  They're coordination of their artillery and armor forced the Germans to pay a heavy price.<br><br>The battle of Gembloux Gap saw the French prevailing against the Germans in a tank vs tank engagement under General Prioux.  Instead of being reinforced, General Prioux was forced to withdraw.  If they had been reinforced, they German front in Belgium may have collapsed.  If the French really had no idea how to use tanks, would they have been able to defeat the combined might of 2 German armored divisions, packing more than 250 vehicles per division?</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>To me, I read the situation differently. In the case of Singapore and France.<br><br>In France, the Political leadership had lost the will to fight, even though their troops were still fighting.<br><br>In Singapore, the Political Leadership (colonial masters) were half hearted in defending their colony, and the troops, mostly weren't too interested in fighting for Singapore too.<br><br>To fight a battle, both the political leadership, AND the military must have the resolve to fight and defeat the enemy.  Lack of resolve on either, will cause the battle to be lost.</div>

Yes they werent as good as the Germans in using them but the quality of their tanks compared to the Germans made up for that.<br><br>The problem with the French was a lack of a plan B. They had 1 plan to stop the Germans and when that failed they just panic and went everyway. Also some of their High command generals were far from the front and could not keep pace thus sometimes issuing orders that could now longer be carried out or were no longer relevant.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>The French were bad users of tanks because they did not co-ordinate their armour, infantry and air support. So what if you have tanks but no infantry to consolidate your gains or exploit a breakthrough made possible by tanks?</div>

Their infantry and supply lines simply could not keep up. They did adopt german methods of break throughs but unlike the germans, they simply could not manuver enough.
