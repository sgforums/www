Not only equip themself, they also equip their pawns in asia to the teeth: Japan although a "self defense" team. they have the world 2nd biggest AWACs fleet, Asia strongest Navy. hundreds of F15J/F-1 etc. even a tiny Taiwan has more Gen 3 fighter jets(F16 + Mirage2000-5) than China (Su27/Su30/J10) till this very moment. How come the Yankees could make so big story out from so poor standing. That's remind me of the Iraqi WMD story again.<br><br>The only way, the PLA can express is: We could not ever win a conventional war, we could never invest 200 billions USD to come out phantom style JSF. However, the god endues China with all the the means to defend her territory from the break-downs like former USSR, Former Yugoslavia. I think that is what the PLA General who is frank enough to point out,: we have all the necessaries mounted on the missiles for delivey to the whole US , u know what is that.<br><br>there's 1 fact for sure: In 5000years of China's history, the country never invades any other foreign territory. They build Great wall to protect themselves from the aggression. However, this land in the 5000 years of the history, also never been fully occupied by any foreign force. Now we c the greatest power on earth already sabre-rattle around to challenge the 5000 year law while denoucing the minimum and hopeless builtup as "great concern".<br><br>We will watch the development with great interesting.</div>

Korea is another similar case , which gained independency after Japan invaded and finally been defeated in WWII.

Tibet rebelled after the communists told over China in 1949. It reminded me of a comment from a fellow Singaporean while studing in UK ten years ago: " China has no rights to take back HK". Does UK has the right to retain HK just simply because she is not a commie state and China is?<br>So, let's be fair.<br><br>As for invasion to Vietnam, I think LKY's memoir said that it was meant to punish Vietnam and to restrain Vietnam's intention to invade other SEA countries.

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>China Denounces U.S. Report on Military </strong><br><br>By JOE McDONALD<br>Associated Press Writer<br><br>BEIJING (AP) -- China denounced a U.S. government report that Beijing wants to expand its regional military power, insisting Wednesday it is no threat to its neighbors and accusing Washington of looking for excuses to sell weapons to rival Taiwan.<br><br>The Chinese Foreign Ministry said it filed a protest with the U.S. Embassy in Beijing over the Pentagon report.<br><br>"The report has baselessly attacked China's modernization of its national defense," Deputy Foreign Minister Yang Jiechi said in a statement, accusing Washington of looking for "an excuse to sell advanced weapons to Taiwan."<br><br>The Pentagon report said Chinese military planners are looking at expanding beyond their immediate goal of dominating Taiwan, the self-ruled island claimed by Beijing as its own territory. It said that in the long term, an increasingly modern Chinese military could pose a threat to U.S. and other forces.<br><br>"Some of China's military planners are surveying the strategic landscape beyond Taiwan," said the 45-page annual assessment of China's military strength.<br><br>Earlier Thursday, Foreign Minister Li Zhaoxing said China is intent on "developing in a peaceful way" when asked about the U.S. report.<br><br>"Not only is China not a threat to anyone, but we would also like to make friends with people in every country, work together and develop mutually beneficial cooperation in order to facilitate everyone's progress," Li said.<br><br>Asian governments from Japan to Southeast Asia to India worry about Beijing's growing military power, driven by a booming economy and double-digit annual spending increases.<br><br>China's military spending already is the world's third-highest at $50 billion to $70 billion a year, behind only the United States and Russia, the Pentagon report said.<br><br>Yang criticized that comparison, noting that spending on China's 2.5 million-member People's Liberation Army is far below the Pentagon's $400 billion-a-year budget.<br><br>"The United States is not qualified to criticize China's defensive national defense policy," Yang's statement said.<br><br>He said the report was "meticulously planned" by the Pentagon to spread fear of China and warned Washington not to encourage activists on Taiwan who want formal independence.<br><br>Beijing is modernizing its arsenal with fighter jets, submarines, missiles and other high-tech weapons - many of them bought from Russia - to back up its frequent threats to attack Taiwan.<br><br>But a senior Pentagon official said although China's military might is growing, he sees no reason to think that Beijing is interested in starting a war.<br><br>"You judge military threat in two ways: one, capacity and two, intent. There's lots of countries in the world that have the capacity to wage war," said Gen. Peter Pace, vice chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff.<br><br>"Very few have the intent to do so. Clearly, we have a complex, but good relationship with China, so there's absolutely no reason for us to believe there's any intent on their part."<br><br>China's short-term goal remains deterring Taiwan from pursuing formal independence and eventually uniting the island with the mainland, the Pentagon report said. Taiwan and China split in 1949, but Beijing claims the self-ruled island as its own territory.<br><br>The United States has cautioned both governments not to force a change in the status quo.<br><br>Washington has no official ties with Taiwan but is the democratic island's main arms supplier and could be drawn into any fighting with the communist mainland.<br><br>Yang's statement affirmed that Beijing wants to unite peacefully with Taiwan. But he also repeated its warning that Beijing "will never tolerate Taiwan independence and will never allow anyone in any way to split Taiwan from China."<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I hope the USA understands that China is prepared to shed A LOT of blood if Taiwan decides to go independent.<br><br>They didn't understand this in Korea and Vietnam, so it led to a great loss of lives on all sides before the US understands that those people were serious about deciding their own destiny without US interference. The US doesn't seem to know itself or its enemies. They always seem to think they go in with guns balzing and everyone will kowtow to them.<br><br>If the USA understands that Taiwan is non-negotiable as far as China is concerned, they will let the idiot-child Chen Sui Bian know in no uncertain terms that the US is strongly against independence.<br><br>But unfortunately, the US is still an enemy of China and is very happy to have a pri.ck like Chen to provoke the Chinese. They know that the Taiwan independence issue will cause the Chinese to go apeshxt and threaten war like madmen. This will make the Chinese look dangerous and give the US excuse to buy more weapons and make more aggressive military moves against China.<br><br>It is a checkmate situation where China (and Taiwan) are not in control of the game and both stand to lose.</div>
