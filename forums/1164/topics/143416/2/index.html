The america still perceived jap as friend until pearl habour was attacked. Wars were fought on the victims land until later. Threats were not identified before the invasion began.<br><br>During cold war period, the world was divided between the communists and the capitalists, both tried to expand their influence. Wars were fought in proxy land and threats to each nation was clearly identified, depending which side are you on.<br><br>With the collapse of communist system, threats to civilization came from extremists, more specifically religious fundamentalists. Such threats come from within the people of each nation and it is more difficult to identify who among us could be threatening. It was reported that the attackers in the latest attack in london were local born and bred. It is long overdue that countries like america should look inside their country and among their own ppl. We should not identify perceived threats based on cold war model.<br><br>American's invasion of iraq highlights the facts that while the world outside of america and britain, face the same threats from terrorists, they do not consider iraq THE threat. They knew very well that many terrorists, including osama, were from saudi, american's strongest ally outside of israel, taleban fighters were trained by CIA, just to name a few.<br><br>While these other nations agreed that Saddam is a tyrant of iraq, they did not believe that Iraq, with one of the world oldest cilivization, can be changed overnight. the yankees are still learning the lesson there and the american invasion has not brought peace and stability to the people of iraq, as the american claimed.<br><br>There are necessities to identify friends and possible threats as the direction for defense strategies, especially a small country like singapore, it is not wise to openly identify the foe before it proves itself one. War talks like that of the stupid chinese general should never be supported and hawkist conclusion from such military report should never be echoed, if we want to reduce the chance of a war.<br><br>Besides cultural exchanges, economic cooperation, and political engagement among countries, mutual respects among the people remain a key factor in safeguarding the world from man made destruction.<br><br>American want the whole world to be like america. "you call it the world, we call it home." Can't have that if they don't know how to respect others.</div>

In fact, LHL in his visit to US recently, urged US to take a positive view on the rise of China.<br><br>Its never good for a country to be inward looking. Qing dynasty caused China to be backward, poor and subject to foreign invasion. I'm quite surprise that you think China should be so weak and poor and do not deserve to open up for progress.<br><br><strong>For those who claim that China is peaceful, can you explain the continual saber-rattling over the outmoded concept of "face" , that prevents her from acknowledging that the Taiwanese people have nothing to do with the mainland politically since 1949.And under legal auspices, it is ironically the US which has the last claim on Taiwan as an island due to it being handed over by the Japanese to the United States when the latter took control and introduced the Provisional Government in Tokyo.During that time,China made no claim to Taiwan because the y had no need to do so,as Taiwan was but a mere island.<br>.</strong>[/quote]<br>I think you are referring to Senkaku/Diao yu island which was claimed by China, taiwan &amp; Japan.<br><br>THis report shows the weakness of China. Somehow, Lee Teng Hui was right that CHina is a paper tiger. China just simply do not have the means to invade Taiwan as stated in the report.<br><br>Why do I think China is not threat? Well, if they can be easily pressurised by US to give up their currency peg to US$, what makes you think they can happily declare war on anybody without fear of international sanctions and US intervention?<br><br>Chinese govt's priority is to manage their economy, fight corruptions, and keeping their country intact. They have too many internal problems to even think of external expansion.<br><br>With US Congress passing a law forbiding arms sales to China, China can only hope to get weapons from Russia and not the West. This means that for many years to come, China will not be able to get the best weapons to counter US or Europe.</div>
