When ST Telemedia want to buy Global Crossing, DoD didn't want to approve as they are using Global crossing network. GCT had to write to VP Dick Cherney to clarify that there will be no security issues. Let's not forget that Lenovo was successful in buying IBM PC business.<br><br>Those Chinese generals can say what they want. But can they deliver? just like Dr M &amp; Syed hamid in 2003 said that if there is no progress in water negotiation, the alternative is war. Mindef responded by staging a full equip open mob. They threaten in words, we respond in action and the water is still 3 sen per 1000 gallons &amp; the crooked bridge was not bulit.<br><br>When was the last time China went to war? they invaded Vietnam and lost 20,000 men during the 14 days war. Not that I look down on them, but they may have over-stated they capabilities.<br><br>US is the only country that can stop Taiwan from going independent. China can't stop them and that's why China is pushing US to stop Taiwan from declaring independent even though Taiwan is functioning like one.</div>

Read http://politics.sgforums.com/?action=thread_display&amp;thread_id=142240 posted by Atobe on this subject. Unocal is a small player and is given oil exploration rights in china, why the uproar?? american wayang show probably.<br><br>One point I get out of this "Unrestricted Warfare" is that war with china will not be defined according to US terms, fought in areas of US choice. 911 was the first time in history war was brought to US soil, resulting in deep soul searching among many americans, "why us?"  Now before america consider starting another war, think carefully, your enemy will hit you where it hurts!! the fighting will not be in colosseum or "one by one."<br><br>better revert to engagement, negotiation, discussion and all other means except war.</div>

But it also achieved success in other sense. You can read about it on the net.<br><br>This war showed that China consistently delivered on its promises to attack. That the invasion of Vietnam went badly onlly strengthened its resolve to do better next time.</div>
