            <div class='col-md body'>With the latest Korean blockbuster war flick "Brotherhood" at the cinemas, we should take time to reflect and separate entertainment from cold hard truths. Although I have not seen the movie yet (will do so soon), think it would be another blood fest with a romantic sub-plot and Cain vs. Abel element thrown in. Forget your "Rambo" or "Apocalypse Now", I think the example of "Band of Brothers" is a more relatable example.<br><br>Based on the bestseller by Stephen E. Ambrose, the epic 10-part miniseries Band of Brothers tells the story of Easy Company, 506th Regiment of the 101st Airborne Division, U.S. Army.<br><br>While in isolation, the series may seem realistic and quite true to the facts, some digging brought up some interesting facts.<br><br>Go to <a href="http://www.101airborneww2.com/bandofbrothers.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.101airborneww2.com/bandofbrothers.html</a> . Have a good read and learn a thing or two about who 'close' Hollywood and reality are.<br><br>Whether we can learn from the movies is another thing.<br><br>[What I admire about this site is the depth of wisdom that flows in some of the posts at military.sgforums.com, although you still get the odd ball post]</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I was shown this website some time back and I came away with the feeling that the author had a massive case of sour grapes, he basically nitpicked at every minute detail that the producers of the show got wrong, in short, I feel Mark Bando is just sore no one bothered to include him in any part of BOB. You can just feel the venom in his words as he proceeds to pick apart the entire series frame by frame. Also note the numerous attempts at shamelessly promoting his so-called expertise and his wonderings why he wasn't called to consult on BOB, with an ego like that, who in their right mind would want to? His ego ruins what would have been an informative piece of writing<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Sour grapes or not, it is interesting how much 'sanitized' Hollywood can make war look clean and clear cut.<br><br>Before "Saving Private Ryan" did we get to see how dreadful a bullet wound can be?<br><br>I guess you are right that maybe there is some political bias always exists in any point of view (small p political = agenda driven, not PAP/WP type Politics). What is a major grumble about "Bank of Brothers" is the fact that they could have done a better story telling. Elements that could have been explained by voice over etc.<br><br>(for those already lost, see http://www.101airborneww2.com/bandofbrothers.html the website to understand what we are discussing).<br><br>A very good example is the takeoff scene of the DC-3 with the paratroopers. We all know that they took off at dusk, in order to arrive on the Dz at midnight of June 5-6. However for the camera, the scene was shot in broad daylight.<br><br>Arguments about ego aside, the main point is that "Never take Hollywood as the whole truth" there are agenda for including or highlighting certain issues. After all movies of real life is a poor cousin of reel life. After all, the artistic director and scene decorator have to still be paid.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I think one of the most realistic film reflecting real military life I've watched is Platoon.Quite old movie dun know if anybody else here remember it or have watched it.<br><br>Not much blood, but captures the mood perfectly. You got all the cast in real life and in the show, gd PS, bastard PS, gung-ho officer, officer who have no clue as to what is happening around them, brave and reliable men,men who chao keng. And it rain all they time when you are deployed. Even the language they speak. One f**k in every sentence.<br><br>Movies like Pte Ryan I feel has realistic dead boodies and gun-shot wounds but mood is more romantic and doesnt really reflect real military life.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I surprisingly got very emotional when I saw "The Thin Red Line" for the 1st time. Screw the plot - just lose yourself into the voice-over narration, physical settings &amp; the randomness of violence. Man, I keep flashing back to ...<br><br>- charging up Peng Kang Hill,<br><br>- doing blind-clearance elsewhere in the Live Firing area (fact: Singapore still have the type of lalang-swaying hills depicted in the film),<br><br>- amphibious-assaulting a Tekong beach as a FO signaller, I believe, with the Commandos,<br><br>- being out of the mission-objective loop in general, even when I was part of an attached FSO team. Charge; regroup; rest; maintainence; small-talk/look around; pack up; form up; follow soldier ahead to next target; anticipation/ambush; charge; regroup ....<br><br>&amp; so on. Kubiak's a genius; I still like to watch the DVD again at least once every 6 months.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Like BlackHawk Down.Got an uncensored version.It was truly touching.The way the men fought,being totally cut off from the great military might Its really touching too,as how 2 of the Delta Snipers Randy Shurghart and Gary Gordon (if I'm not mistaken) volunteered to go down and secure a crashsite unaided,and not even sure if the pilot is alive.<br><br>Training does play a part,yes.But however,who can give up their lives for someon unknown?So willingly despite knowing the full risks and consequence.100 men, against a mob of 5000 angry heavily armed militia men.The odds of survival aren't very high,however they made it out.With the assistance of armoured vehicles and tanks "borrowed" from the UN peacekeeping force and the invovlement of even clerks,cooks,armourers.Bloodied and bruised,but still they made it out.<br><br>A salute to the men of Army Delta,Army Rangers, 160th Night Stalkers and the various elements who were directly or indirectly involved,your willing acts of courage will always be remembered.I salute you.</div>
