            <div class='col-md body'>Stuff like tanks and destroyers won't exactly help you much against terrorists.  Which dumb terrorist would let himself get caught by a tank?  And 3 destroyers can only be in three places at once at anytime, not very helpful considering Australia's coastline and the expectation that terrorists can and will strike anywhere.<br><br>I thought that the best way to counter terrorism is alway to improve ability of local agencies to detect plausible threats and bring to bear the the small and controlled amount of fire power needed to bring down the terrorists.  How often will the terrorists have a nice cave complex away from population centres such that u can have the opportunity to use your land attack missiles on them?<br><br>What the Aussie govt was looking for was prob a reason to justify such high-profile searches, terrorism is a very convienient reason since they dun have to elaborate on that terrorist threat due to the high amount of publicity accorded to anything related to terrorist.<br><br>my two cents<br><br>addition:<br><br>forgot to ask when i first posted: Will the Americans and British be willing to sell their Abrams and Challenger?  How do the Aussies know they'll sell if the Americans and British haven't such tanks to other countries previously?</div>
