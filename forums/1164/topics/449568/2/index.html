              And "Susanteo" is way too pessimistic about others not wanting Singapore. 80km of land to take over for an additional 200 Billion in GDP is almost always worth it, provided you can get away with it. It's half Malaysia's annual GDP and 1/4 of Indonesia's. That kind of economic boost + shipyards + mature manufacturing infrastructure is very valuable.
              
              As for wasting time in NS, ask for a transfer to a more... flexible unit. Lots of fun, assault boat, rapelling, heli-rapelling, airborne if you're CDO, combat survival (ultimate jia-zhua :P ), POW training, demo etc. If you end up in a zho-bo unit, then obviously you will zho-bo for 2 years.

              <p>if there is a war, there won't be any GDP to talk about, especially 
              for a country like Singapore. There will always be a power at the top of
               any country, so if you don't like the power, and not enough people 
              agree with you to change them, or we don't know a better way, you change your country. but in the end, 
              what is the choice? is it about changing for the better, or "enough of 
              this, anything else doesn't matter"?</p>
              <p>GDP doesn't indicate the 
              maturity of a country, it is the will of the people to live together, to
               make changes together, and together we defend our way of life. We make 
              do with an unsatisfactory government and we accept some stupid

              Its an urban legend. 2,000 poorly armed gurkhas isn't much anti-anything. The Gurkhas are unique in Singapore as they are police officers, not soldiers and little to distinguish between other cheap foreign workers. They guard key installations. That's about it. They had a very good role quelling riots etc in the 50s/60s but those days are basically gone.
              
              We have more problems with them nowadays esp over pay...plus the failures in the Mas Selamat detention.

              Li, mercs are NEVER a good idea to base your army on. Ask Malacca. 
              
              And they will never be loyal to Singapore, Singapore is their employee, not their home, they finish their tour and go back to their family, bye bye. It's like expecting construction workers to develop loyalty to Singapore just because they worked 5 years here. Possible to happen, but seriously unlikely.
              
              And not to mention supply of your "special forces" then ends up depending on other countries. Right now, if we had went "Gurkhas = SOF",  Nepal is planning to cut supply of soldiers to other countries to improve its' image, we would have been stripped of our whole SOF force in one PR decision.
              
              And "fitness" is built up. The reason Singaporeans are less fit is not because we're "weaker", I know some of our guys who train with SEAL and GSG9 and they pulled through, it's because we spend a lot of our time on our ass in class, in front of the TV and computer instead of running around. Go to any gym and look for the long term exercisers and see if they are "less fit".

              <p>That won't save a lot of money. If you knew what's the breakdown of the Mindef budget, then you'd realise that components such as SAR-21 is only a very, very small component of the actual cost.</p>
              <p>Even if one doesn't buy any SAR-21, its probablyÂ save likeÂ less than $10m in a $12b annual budget.</p>
