              <p>First, you must cordon the block with Leopard MBTs from 48 SAR and
              the whole of 7SIB. Meanwhile, Primus from 21 SA zero in on the building
              while Chinooks deploy Pegasus howitzers for added punch. Must use
              Chinook, coz heli-deployment very stylo. LRRP from 1st Commando will
              insert 3 days prior to the operation to recce the place and mark
              targets with lasers. Apaches launch hellfires onto every level while
              F-16s and F-15s drop JDAMS. SOF will conduct free-fall from Super Pumas
              and land on the roof and blaze down ten stories while Guardsmen rappel
              head-first down from more helis and crash through glass windows.
              Night-vision gear and infrared opticals are mandatory regardless of
              time of day. Meanwhile, CDF, COA and Defence Minister have a grandstand
              view of the whole excercise.</p>

              <p>You launch a C-130 mounted with FANTAIL UAVs strapped to its wings from an LHD using JATO rockets, then when you are over the target area you'll release the FANTAILS to crash into the windows of buildings... at the same time, drop your inline skate force soldiers 50 meters away from the target building so they can grab their scope-handle equipped SAR-21s and skate for their lives across open ground under heavy enemy fire to storm the building.</p>
              <p>Meanwhile, all this is being coordinated from a 250 ton blast-rated Underground Ammo Facility that is being used as a command facility that is expected to wistand a 30 MEGATON nuclear attack.

              <p>In the event the battle is not going well, this commander will then thrawl the net for every negative article on their enemy's military and then send it over the command net to convince friendly troops that despite apperances, the enemy is full of "systemic" failures and really can't fight. If the battle is really bad, then this commander will suddenly abandon the battle and pick another one to face similar results, or dissappear (if the trashing is really bad) for a while to think up of "new" and "innovative" ways to fight wars that usually involve crashing expensive stuff to kill non expensive stuff, shooting aircraft off ships too small to support them, and finding ways to use things like inline skates, party hats, and water pistols and associated stuff to fight a real shooting war.</p>

              <p>With what purpose and objective in mind? In a peacetime scenario, cops will prob sent in the STAR. Cops dun shoot to kill unless necessary like in life threatening scenario, so there will probably be subjects arrested and brought away. If the aim is to be simply take down the building, with or without prisoners not an issue, the other parties being dead or alive, not an issue, bombard it...</p>

              <p>Wait... wait... wait... what about this?</p>
              <p>You launch a C-130 mounted with FANTAIL UAVs strapped to its wings from an LHD using JATO rockets, then when you are over the target area you'll release the FANTAILS to crash into the windows of buildings... at the same time, drop your inline skate force soldiers 50 meters away from the target building so they can grab their scope-handle equipped SAR-21s and skate for their lives across open ground under heavy enemy fire to storm the building.</p>
              <p>Meanwhile, all this is being coordinated from a 250 ton blast-rated Underground Ammo Facility that is being used as a command facility that is expected to wistand a 30 MEGATON nuclear attack. The commander in this facility will be well trained in looking through the internet and google for stuff on ST weapons, spend some time find ways to say why it is better then other country's systems, as well as copy and pasting many articles on the military written by non-military personnel which they will send to their soldiers to tell them how to fight.</p>
              <p>In the event the battle is not going well, this commander will then thrawl the net for every negative article on their enemy's military and then send it over the command net to convince friendly troops that despite apperances, the enemy is full of "systemic" failures and really can't fight. If the battle is really bad, then this commander will suddenly abandon the battle and pick another one to face similar results, or dissappear (if the trashing is really bad) for a while to think up of "new" and "innovative" ways to fight wars that usually involve crashing expensive stuff to kill non expensive stuff, shooting aircraft off ships too small to support them, and finding ways to use things like inline skates, party hats, and water pistols and associated stuff to fight a real shooting war.</p>
              <p>Hmm...</p>

              <p>lols. nice one.. the lionnoisy approach...</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>lets say the building is held by hostiles, (ie the enemy) would it be better to send in large forces? or small "sticks" of troops?</p>
              <p>how many soldiers would it take to effectively defend a building?</p>
