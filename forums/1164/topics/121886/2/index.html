The year was 1983, Sultan issue in Matland that it might end up civil war that swept to Sgp. SAF was ordered fully standby and all active or semi active units (even logistic base) were order to in REDCON within days, briefing was conducted to all unit regarding ammo &amp; ration arrangement (the scenario was one button press, you had to bring what ever resource you had to collect what you could &amp; fuck off the place asap without any verification), as for semi active unit (ROD leave or half strength was reservist) logistic arrangement such that troop come back, they straight go to their vehicle, start the engine &amp; go (all weapon &amp; SBO, etc.. all ready &amp; lock inside the vehicles), live ammo shall be in the con area.<br><br>During the D day, was 1st time in SAF mobilized full brigade troop openly issue with weapon, by the way, live ammo was already drawn but not issue to the troop yet  (of cause they did not know about it) &amp; gun was pointing the direction. It was stand down till the Sultans give way at the dead line.<br><br>This is not a make up story.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>My opinion - in the 1990s there were 2 significant events - the Malaysian-Indonesian parachute drop and the SQ hijacking. Both had something to do with Malaysia. I was doing my NS at that time - and was on standby the week the hijack took place. Also during that period - there were some changes in Singapore - we had a new Prime Minister and the re-organisation of the SAF divisions. Looking back, I feel that somebody just wanted to test us.<br><br>Anyway - should get back to the original topic of the Terrex.............</div>
