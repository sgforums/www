              <p>You have mentioned so many STK systems, so tell me, why is the

              revealed on Janes so many years ago? Or even the SAR21 40GL that
              you have repeatedly showed off to us?</p>
              <p>Why ah? Why ah?</p>
              <p>and you still have the guts to ask people to ask people to tell
              you in not more than 100 words about a system that people are

              Module (EGLM) program has received approval from the United States
              Government (USG) to enter into the Initial Operational Test &amp;
              Evaluation (IOT&amp;E) phase. Scheduled to commence in July and be
              complete by mid-December, the IOT&amp;E will consist of select US
              Military operators testing the weapons in simulated “real-world”
              mission scenarios. Both quantitative and qualitative data will be
              collected, with the ultimate and desired outcome having the weapons
              being designated “Operationally Effective” and “Operationally Suitable”
              for fielding to US Forces.</p>
              <p>This next step comes close on the heels of the SCAR and EGLM
              successfully passing their Low-Rate Initial Production (LRIP)
              acceptance testing conducted February through June of 2007.<strong> Going
              forward, as all timelines fall into place and the weapons test
              successfully, the SCAR and EGLM can be fielded, on a limited basis, to
              select US Military Forces by late fall of 2007</strong>. Plans to fully field
              the <strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">weapons are now developed and in place, with over $25M
              (procurement) budgeted in the FY2008 Presidential Budget and over $6M
              slated for FY2009.</span></strong></p>
              </blockquote>
              <p>From personal experience, I just gotta say these weapons rock. I
              fired the SCAR Heavy and Light at FNH’s range near Fredericksburg, Va.,
              several months ago and fell particularly in love with the SCAR Heavy.
              The gas/piston system has a great “thunk-thunk” mechanical feel to it
              and the 7.62 caliber heavy packs a heck of a punch. The SCAR Light is
              easy to fire, very adjustable, and the barrels are easy to interchange
              - creating basically a whole new weapon for each variation.</p>
              <p>Much to my chagrin, they wouldn’t let me test fire the EGLM (darn!).</p>
              <p>With the new move to IOT&amp;E, the SCAR earns a new designation: Mk-16 and Mk-17...</p>
              <blockquote>
              <p>The SCAR system consists of two highly adaptable modular rifle
              platforms and a grenade launcher. Now US DoD type-designated as the MK
              16 MOD 0 5.56mm Special Operations Forces Combat Assault Rifle - Light
              (SCAR-L) and the MK 17 MOD 0 7.62mm Special Operations Forces Combat
              Assault Rifle – Heavy (SCAR-H), both SCAR platforms are available with
              three different barrel lengths optimized for conducting operations in
              close-quarters combat, standard infantry and longer-range precision
              fire roles. All SCAR barrels can be easily interchanged by the operator
              in the field in just minutes to instantly meet the requirements of
              virtually any mission. The newly designated MK 13 MOD 0 40mm Enhanced
              Grenade Launcher Module (EGLM) quickly mounts to the underside of
              either SCAR platform, providing additional punch to the individual
              warfighter’s firepower and can be easily configured for use as a
              stand-alone weapon as well.</p>

              </p>
              <p>FNH says the Mk-16 and Mk-17 are the first assault rifles to be
              procured through a “full and open competition” since the M4/M16
              carbines in the 1960s. Both FNH weapons are impressive and we’ll see
              how the operational tests and initial fielding go. I bet operators who
              get a chance to “test” them won’t want to give them up. I didn’t</p>

              <blockquote>To replace the M4 Socom is now fielding the FN Herstal Special
                      Operations Forces Combat Assault Rifle (Scar) family, which consists of
                      the 5.56-mm Mk 16 Scar-Light, the 7.62-mm Mk 17 Scar-Heavy and the
                      40-mm Mk 13 Enhanced Grenade Launcher Module (EGLM), which can be
                      fitted to both models as well as the M4A1 carbine. Originally a
                      separate request for proposals had been issued for an ELGM to replace
                      the M203 in January 2004, but two months later it was merged with the
                      Scar project. <strong>The ELGM leverages technology from the 40-mm UGL
                      developed as part of the company's F2000 5.56-mm Modular Assault Weapon
                      System. </strong>The EGLM consists of the <strong><span style="color: #ff0000;"><span style="color: #f5bff6;">grenade launcher, <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">a fire control
                      system</span> </span>and a buttstock assembly to allow the EGLM to be used as a
                      stand-alone weapon</span>.</span></strong> The FN Herstal launcher weighs 1.3 kg and measures
                      30 cm in length when used in the under-barrel mode; the standalone
                      weapon weighs 2.7 kg and measures 67.5 cm with buttstock extended. The
                      ELGM fires standard 40 x 46 mm munitions, special low velocity
                      munitions and can also accommodate longer munitions than the M203. A
                      Special Operations requirement is that the 'Increment 1' ELGM can be
                      upgraded to fire 'Increment 2' programmable munitions. Under an
                      eight-year indefinite delivery/indefinite quantity contract up to<span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong> 21,000 launchers, 25,000 fire control units and 25,000 butt-stocks

              <blockquote>
              <p>Small Arms</p>
              <p>In December 2007 the US Special Operations Command is scheduled to
                  complete the<strong> I<span style="text-decoration: underline;">nitial Operational Test &amp; Evaluation (IOT&amp;E)</span> </strong>of
                  the FN Herstal 5.56 mm/7.62 mm Special Operations Forces Combat Assault
                  Rifle (Scar) and <strong>the 40 mm Enhanced Grenade Launcher Module (EGLM).</strong> A
                  positive outcome will result in the weapons being designated
                  'Operationally Effective' and 'Operationally Suitable' for fielding.
                  The Scar is one of the most important small arms projects in the world
                  today.</p>
              <p>Socom released a request for proposals in January 2004 and only
                  eleven months later selected FN Herstal's candidate from numerous
                  worldwide competitors. The requirement was influenced by a number of
                  factors, including dissatisfaction with the performance of the 5.56 mm
                  M4 carbine in the War on Terror and the need for a weapon that fires a
                  more powerful cartridge than the Nato standard 5.56 x 45 mm SS109 (US
                  M855) round.</p>
              <p>Development was expedited by bringing Socom project managers,
                  budget officials and special forces operators together at FN Herstal's
                  facilities in Liege, Belgium. Operators were able to suggest changes to
                  the weapon's design to FN engineers, who often presented a solution the
                  next day, thus telescoping a process that normally takes months if not
                  years. This procedure also ensured the design truly meets the needs of
                  frontline SOF operators. Scar production is anticipated at FN's
                  facility in Columbia.</p>
              <p>The Scar's modular design provides 90% 'ergonomic compatibility'
                  and 60% parts commonality between the two different calibre weapons,
                  which have now been type-classified as the Mk 16 Mod 0 Scar-L and the
                  Mk 17 Mod 0 Scar-H. The Mk 16 can be fitted with a 254 mm close quarter
                  combat (CQC) barrel, a 355.60 mm standard barrel and a 457.2 mm long
                  barrel for accurate fire at longer ranges while the Mk 17 has 330.20
                  mm, 406.40 and 508 mm barrels. The CQC barrel is intended for use at
                  combat ranges up to 200 metres, while the standard barrel is designed
                  for combat at 300 to 500 metres and the SV barrel is optimised to
                  engage targets between 500 and 800 metres.</p>
              <p>The user is able to change barrels in less than five minutes with
                  the aid of a special wrench, thus allowing the soldier to choose the
                  appropriate barrel length for a specific mission. Both weapons are
                  fitted with MIL-STD-1913 'Picatinny' rails at the 12, 3, 6 and 9
                  o'clock positions that are compatible with 'nearly' all of the
                  components of the M4 carbine Special Operations Modification (Sopmod)
                  kit and the new twelve-gauge XM26 Modular Accessory Shotgun System
                  produced by C-More Systems. A requirement for a weapon that can use
                  'pickup' 7.62 x 39 mm Russian standard ammunition found in operational
                  situations may be met through further development of the Mk 17.<span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong> The
                  third distinct element of the project is the EGLM, now type classified
                  as the Mk 13 Mod 0, which can be fitted to both calibre weapons and
                  also used as a stand-alone weapon. The EGLM is derived from the grenade
                  launcher FNH developed for its modular F2000 5.56 mm assault rifle</strong></span>.</p>
              <p>In October 2007 FN Herstal (FNH) completed <strong><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">deliveries of 886 Mk
                  16s, 772 Mk 17s and 196 Mk 13s ordered</span> </span></strong>under a low-rate initial
                  production contract for the IOT&amp;E phase. Socom has requested
                  funding to buy 3502 Mk 16s, 2798 Mk 17s and 1804 Mk 13s worth more than
                  $ 25 million in fiscal year 2008 (FY08) and 1569 Mk 16s, 500 Mk 17s and
                  500 Mk 13s worth more than $ six million the following year. Officials
                  have previously indicated the project could total 84,000 5.56 mm and
                  15,000 7.62 mm weapons. FNH should be well placed with the Scar should
                  the US Army decide to revive its protracted efforts to field a
                  replacement for the 5.56 mm M16 rifle/M4 carbine family.</p>

              <p><em>The U.S. Army's Picatinny Arsenal, N.J., has awarded ATK and
                      General Dynamics Armament and Technical Products (GDATP) a contract to
                      deliver Mk19 Grenade Machine Guns, battle-tested 72-pound, 40mm weapons
                      able to fire up to 375 rounds per minute at ranges out to 2,000 meters.
                      Deliveries are expected to begin next year, ATK and Army officials
                      said. </em></p>
              <p><em>"The Mk19 gives a
                      military unit a heavy volume of close, accurate, continuous fire which
                      can be used against hovering enemy aircraft and lightly armored
                      vehicles by providing devastating fire into an engagementarea," said
                      Richard Audette, deputy program manager for soldier weapons, Picatinny
                      Arsenal, N.J., speaking in September before the contract award. </em></p>
              <div class="related"><em><span class="head">Related Topics</span></em> 
              <ul class="relatedStories">
              <li><em><a href="http://www.defensenews.com/channel.php?c=AME&amp;s=TOP">Americas</a></em></li>
              </ul>
              </div>
              <p><em>In total, the Army plans to buy 4,600 new grenade launchers, Audette said. </em></p>
              <p><em>As
                      the incumbent Mk19 producer, GDATP was awarded two Mk19 contracts Oct.
                      7 for $66 million, according to a GDATP press statement. </em></p>
              <p><em>Meanwhile,
                      ATK's $53.4 million award marks the company's first contract to produce
                      crew-served weapons systems, officials said. ATK partnered with FN
                      Manufacturing (FNMI) for the competition. </em></p>
              <p><em>"The scope of the
                      award was several thousand units," said Jim Cates, manager with ATK
                      mission systems. "The Mk19 is an old weapon that has been around for 30
                      years. We put together a solid industry team with FNMI that offered the
                      Army a low-risk approach." </em></p>
              <p><em>GDATP has built more than 37,000
                      Mk19s since 1984. The U.S. Army now has 23,313 Mk19s in its inventory.
                      A fully loaded Mk19 costs roughly $21,500.</em></p>
              <p><em>Typically mounted on
                      vehicles, the Mk19 is designed with an open-bolt firing mechanism so
                      that rounds don't overheat in the barrel and accidentally "cook off."</em></p>
              <p><em>"The
                      weapon's [high explosive ammunition] has a safe-and-arm mechanism where
                      it doesn't arm until it gets about 18 meters from the gun," said
                      Jeffrey Gramse, GDATP Mk19 program manager. </em></p>
              <p><em>Irregular wars in Iraq and Afghanistan are driving the need for more Mk19s, Audette said. </em></p>
              <p><em>"Humvees
                      are the main use right now, and we're seeing that a little more in
                      Afghanistan than in Iraq," Audette said. "In Iraq, what you have is a
                      lot of activity in close quarters, and when you are talking about a
                      high-explosive grenade, you are always worried about collateral damage."---EOQ</em></p>

              <p>This is a deleted info from ST.</p>
              <p>mmm</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Gday, this is my first post here, I hope you don't mind if I join the discussion? as I would like to point out a few things, lionnoisy said "I dunt know how SG Ty gets the info <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">when Oz OICW is still in drawing board</span></strong>" I don't know where you got that information from, but firstly let me tell you that it is called the <span style="color: #888888;"><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">AICW (Advanced Individual Combat weapon)</span></strong></span> it is based on the Steyr rifle and is fitted with FCS and a 3 shot grenade launcher, it has been tested sucessfully, it is a low pressure GL at the moment, and looks to be fielded in 2010 or thereabouts.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> I have an idea that the delay here in fielding, is because the DSTO in Oz have a second CTD (Concept Technology Demonstrator)for the AICW, one where they say both the rifle and the GL are high velocity (I take that to mean High Pressure), I saw some discussion previously about how the 40mm grenade compared to 25mm over long distances left the 40mm version wanting? this will fix that problem in one fell swoop, I believe it will be using stacked propellant technology which is one method of achieving Mach 5/50 physics, perhaps in the Rifle but certainly in the GL, when I say perhaps in the Rifle ? I see that metalstorm has a patent for a type of cartridge that has two projectile in each and is electronically fired causing both projectiles to leave at hyper velocity,it is still mag fed and is similar in operation to the existing principles behind the Styer I believe except that it is fired electronically, we shall see then what people think of the AICW then??? as I believe it will have <span style="color: #888888;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>selectable range</strong></span></span> as well as <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">selectable kinetic impact</span></strong>, you just watch them take notice then!</p>

              <p>ok, putting aside all this flaming, are airburst grenades considered cluster munitions?</p>
              <p>On a side note im sure we've all heard of the recent accords signed by majority of the world's nations banning the use, storage and manufacture of cluster munitions... one of the countries who refused to sign and continue to store and manufacture cluster munitions is non other thannnn........

              <p>not sure.</p>
              <p>i m not too sure of the technicalities of it but it would depend on the munition.</p>
              <p>1) munition explodes = produce shnarpel = not a cluster munition<br>2) munition explodes = release sub-munitions= sub munitions explode = cluster munition</p>
              <p>we are coincidentally the world's largest manufacturer of AP mines. next time you see a legless kid in some report or article about some conflict zone or in the dark continent, do remember the good folks at ST Kinetics. pretty high probability of that mine being produced in singapore.</p>
              <p>on a more serious note, ST is a indiscriminate seller. Lots of arms and ammunition being used by the burmese Junta and the rebel groups in their armed conflicts come from ST. no open sales but under the table distribution.</p>
