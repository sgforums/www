              <p>Please don't try to argue black to white.</p>
              <p>And I trained in urban warfare before, don't try to smoke me.</p>
              <p>Is the SSW only meant for urban warfare?</p>
              <p>Shorter range does not mean you can use a weaker weapon. In fact if anything it requires a STRONGER weapon as a margin of error is now smaller. The harder hitting AK-47 is a more valued weapon in short range ambushes then the M-16 in Iraq, and that's no surprise why.</p>
              <p>In fact the problem with PDW is that compared to full AR is they have poorer barrier performance as well as stopping power. This is CRUCIAL in MOUT as the short ranges mean that you jolly well be able to shoot through cover as well as put your opponent down in one short.</p>
              <p>This is why PDW is called a Personal DEFENCE Weapon, and not an ASSAULT rifle. It is something for the SSW user to DEFEND himself with, as opposed to attacking. </p>
              <p>Additionally, the SAF does not just fight in MOUT, a lot of the training still involves operations in jungle as well.</p>
              <p>So why did the SSW use a PDW?</p>
              <p>Simple, it's a compromise. Instead of trying to figure out the weight issue of a multi-shot grenade launcher with a full rifle they are simply slapping a PDW as a lightweight backup just in case something goes wrong and the user needs to defend himself... but the PDW is</p>
              <p>But make no mistake, it can't compare to a fully modular AR with MPRS. The Israeli concept will simply be far more flexible then the SSW.</p>
              <p>This is why:</p>
              <p>Firstly the MPRS setup is based on the outset to be MODULAR and can be used with any modern firearm with a P-Rail and a GL. It can be used with underslung grenade launcher, bullet trap rifle grenades as well as other kinds of smart munitions. The SSW is just stuck with it's format.</p>
              <p>Additionally, the failure of an MPRS outfield will not disable the entire system. Instead of sending back the entire weapon for repair, the modular nature means that field replacement can simply be done just like changing sights for the P-Rail.</p>
              <p>Even better, being modular, this means that the users of the MPRS system will be able to take advantages of advances in technology, such as different caliber grenades without extensive retooling, this modular advantage also means that the soldiers can share parts and ammunition.</p>
              <p>The SSW however, is unable to share parts or ammunition with normal SAR-21 or Ultimax 100 users. This further complicates the logistics line by needing to issue PDW ammo. In addition the SSW cannot be used like a normal AR, and if it's out of grenades it's a grossly overweight and oversized PDW. </p>

              <p>Why PDWs cannot replace Assault Rifles in MOUNT:</p>
              <blockquote>
              <p>The PDW concept has not been widely successful, among other reasons because PDWs are not significantly cheaper to manufacture than full sized assault rifles, and are more expensive than most SMGs while being less effective in scenarios where armor-piercing ammunition is unavailable or unnecessary (such as most civilian and law enforcement applications). <strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">The potential military market for PDWs has been dampened, due to the introduction of </span></strong><a title="Carbine" href="http://sgforums.com/wiki/Carbine"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">carbines</span></strong></span></a><strong><span style="color: #ff0000;"> based on full-size assault rifles (such as the </span></strong><a class="mw-redirect" title="M4 carbine" href="http://sgforums.com/wiki/M4_carbine"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">M4 carbine</span></strong></span></a><strong><span style="color: #ff0000;"> variant of the </span></strong><a title="M16A2" href="http://sgforums.com/wiki/M16A2"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">M16A2</span></strong></span></a><strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">) that retain most features of and compatibility with their full-sized relatives.</span></strong></p>
              </blockquote>
              <p>What PDWs are good for:</p>
              <blockquote>
              <p>Though they have never become very popular for military applications, many personal defense weapons have found their way into the hands of security forces and some <a title="Special forces" href="http://sgforums.com/wiki/Special_forces"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0066cc;">special forces</span></span></a> as direct replacements for submachine guns. Like submachine guns, PDWs are ultra-light weapons, and their high rate of fire and lower recoil from pistol-sized cartridges enable higher accuracy. Assault rifles and carbines, by comparison, are generally heavier and have higher muzzle blast and recoil and may overpenetrate due to their rifle rounds.</p>

              they have poorer barrier performance as well as stopping power.
              This is CRUCIAL in MOUT as the short ranges mean that you jolly
              well be able to shoot through cover as well as put your opponent
              down in one short.</p>
              <p>This is why PDW is called a Personal DEFENCE Weapon, and not an
              ASSAULT rifle. It is something for the SSW user to DEFEND himself
              with, as opposed to attacking. </p>
              <p>Additionally, the SAF does not just fight in MOUT, a lot of the
              training still involves operations in jungle as well.</p>
              <p>So why did the SSW use a PDW?</p>
              <p>Simple, it's a compromise. Instead of trying to figure out the
              weight issue of a multi-shot grenade launcher with a full rifle
              they are simply slapping a PDW as a lightweight backup just in case
              something goes wrong and the user needs to defend himself... but
              the PDW is</p>
              <p>But make no mistake, it can't compare to a fully modular AR with
              MPRS. The Israeli concept will simply be far more flexible then the
              SSW.</p>
              <p>This is why:</p>
              <p>Firstly the MPRS setup is based on the outset to be MODULAR and
              can be used with any modern firearm with a P-Rail and a GL. It can
              be used with underslung grenade launcher, bullet trap rifle
              grenades as well as other kinds of smart munitions. The SSW is just
              stuck with it's format.</p>
              <p>Additionally, the failure of an MPRS outfield will not disable
              the entire system. Instead of sending back the entire weapon for
              repair, the modular nature means that field replacement can simply
              be done just like changing sights for the P-Rail.</p>
              <p>Even better, being modular, this means that the users of the
              MPRS system will be able to take advantages of advances in
              technology, such as different caliber grenades without extensive
              retooling, this modular advantage also means that the soldiers can
              share parts and ammunition.</p>
              <p>The SSW however, is unable to share parts or ammunition with
              normal SAR-21 or Ultimax 100 users. This further complicates the
              logistics line by needing to issue PDW ammo. In addition the
              SSW cannot be used like a normal AR, and if it's out of
              grenades it's a grossly overweight and oversized
              PDW. </p>

              <p>you mean he can even possess the mental capabilities to flog a horse ?</p>
              <p>wow.</p>
              <p>so far lionnoisy has demonstrated absolutely no grasp of reason or logic whatsoever. period. inferring from this, i deduce that he cant logically realise the horse is dead, and the act of flogging is redundant.</p>
