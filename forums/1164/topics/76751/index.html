            <div class='col-md body'>Dogs were used in many ways during ww2, as messagers, for seeking out enemy positions and seeking out wounded allied soldiers. Don't think any dog manage to actually kill an enemy soldier, though they manage to save their handlers by attacking the enemy soldiers till they ran away or were shot. Some dogs lost their lives because of this heroic act. *respect*<br>The US Marines in ww2 used dogs to locate snipers, bunkers, tripmines and machine gun nest . They were very effective, none of the patrol which had a dog was ever ambushed, though there was still casualty in the ensuing firefight.<br>During the Vietnam war, dogs were also used in the same way. They were so effective, the North Vietnamese Army placed bounty on the dog teams, with a higher bounty for the death of the dog!</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>You can strap a collar receiver that transmit tones to the dogs.<br><br>Eg Soldiers wearing SAF RFID tags will emit a soothing tone and dog is calm. Attack tone can drive the dog mad and attack everyone in sight.<br><br>You can use these tones to command the dogs to do other things as well. Eg activate a bomb, camera, receiver, move into ambush position, charge in certain direction or change direction.<br><br>I think today they can still be used as flanking attack given their speed and stealth. You can position, under cover, these dog packs in flanking attack.<br><br>You see a tanned young bespectacled boy soldier, skinny but super aerobic fit, carrying a super gun -&gt; you wouldn't be that much deterred.....the soldier would also exhibit some hesitation.<br><br>But the same soldier with a huge drooling massive growling dog.....you want to stay away and this dog would probably add to the soldiers' confidence in battle.<br><br>Plus there is the bonding and sense of duty to each other as they do their NS.<br><br>Probably a force multiplier for infantry/troopers.</div>
