Im quite sure the RSN as well as the RMN are waiting for the rest to be built and ready(or not?). I read that they upgraded the old Kasturi class recently but they`re old corvettes and they can`t be upgraded much. I don`t think they have any potent air-defence missile system on board. The Lekiu class are nice ships to have but they have only two. Nothing in the league of the Formidables; and the Formidables are not even optimally armed with her current armaments. Thier equivalent for the Victory class, the Laksamana class, are great ships too. But they have only four. The ancient Perdana class are, well, antiquated. Our old Sea-Wolf gunboats fared better in the former`s prime.<br><br>In case if no one has noticed, the RSN has just superseded every navy in SEA in the last few years in terms of capability. The RMN would be severely stretched in a maritime conflict given the length of her coast-lines and breath of sea-lanes. They would even have trouble imposing themselves on Brunei if she has got herself the Nakhoda Ragam class vessels by now(not sure if they already do..). Anyway, kudos to the RMN for being able to maintain a decent fleet of old ships amidst new ones as well.<br><br>You should have included RSN`s 12 PVs as well. They are generally better armed than most PVs; including and perhaps even the Malaysian Meko currently. Pop a few harpoons or gabriels on board and they`ll be leagues ahead than the Perdana class; not to say they already are`nt save the lack of SSMs on board. In that sense, we even have a larger bunch of surface combatants.</div>
