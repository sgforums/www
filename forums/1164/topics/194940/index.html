(Of cos,it is a advantage) Remember the Six -Days war of 1967? Egyptian missile craft fire 52 Styx SSM with range of 60km against Israel Missile gunboat while none hit the target,cos Israel uses ECM and jam them badly... While Israel fire only 7 Gabriel SSM with range of 30km and all hit the target and sunk the Eygpt fleet....<br><br>Brahomos as a ramjet missile has high heat signature and detecting it will not be a problem.

The Mach 8 version will be used by the RN and the IN only.<br><br>Also I suspect the Air launched version will be sold to Malaysia or any other country. May be the Ship or land launched version.</div>

Just take out and insert new modules into the hull. But it also means changing the 4 x 8-cell A43 VLS to another 4 x 8-cell A70 VLS. That costs money. Lots of money. We must know that our Mindef always buy things for the future uses. It doesn't make sense to buy them and put them aside after just a few years of using them.<br><br>Also A70 VLS are not suitable to be configured for our 3,200 tonnes frigate as they are built for heavy frigate. Putting them on Formidable will result in 'overweight' problem like what our missile corvette suffered from the heavy EW mast.<br><br>But nevertheless, I also wish for Scalp Naval, and Aster-30 perhaps, to be introduced so that we can have a true blue water capability with cruise missile to strike land-based target and area air defence missile to protect fleet.<br></div>
