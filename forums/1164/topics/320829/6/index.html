              <p>Found what I was looking for ... a 2004 press release from United Defense stated that the USN had selected the Mark 110 (Bofors 57/70 Mk. 3) ...</p>

              <p>The Mk 100 has also been selected for the USCG NS Cutter and OP Cutter.  It has also been baselined for the LCS Flight 0.</p>

              <p>  Which yet again shows u lacking in depth  understanding of how a DDG-1000 integrated ADS works.</p>
              <p>Yes, u don’t see SEA-RAM because there’s more capable ESSM in place of that.</p>
              <p>Of course I can expect you will ask why DDG-51 features both ESSM and SEA-RAM but DDG-1000 doesn’t?</p>
              <p>DDG-51’s anti-air fire channels are limited by only 3 AN/SPG-62 Fire control radars.   SPG-62 not only has to provide terminal guidance to ESSM but also SM-2. any leaking Sea skimming ASHCM from the most formable SM-2/ESSM interception could only be the fire channels are saturated, so that’s why a standalone, fire-n-forget SEA-RAM comes into play to make up the fire channel discrepancy.</p>
              <p>However, DDG-1000 features an AESA SPY-3 to provide all kinds of fire control needs for all AAW missiles. Because it’s AESA, it can provide numerous fire channels by DBF. So the limitation only comes to the launch speed of ESSM, but MK57 VLS is more capable than a SEA-RAM’s slope launch box. At least provide better 360 degree coverage. So what u see is the primary close-in weapon system seamless built in with the theater air defense system. Don’t forget RIM-162 ESSM outperforms or at least matches the RIM-116’s every envelope.  From close to far. From low to high. Of course a SEA-RAM CIWS appears in other form cam mislead the mass.</p>
              <p>Think Yanks will trust an unproven gun system to be the primary CIWS? Yet another no clue about how the world only superpower with half of world war chest comes into weapon system selection.</p>
              <p>Even comes into apple to apple comparison, I don’t understand a DDG-1000 features 2 X57mm guns at a speed almost double that of OTO SR 76mm gun can be similar to a single gunned frigate for CIWS need? A sheer rate of fire comparison is MK110 on board DDG-1000 is almost 4 times greater than Formidable class.</p>

              <p>Dear 38,</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial;">This is so
                  good I have to do this one first.  </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial;">You have

                  manuver at terminal stage, by Inertia flight?  the SEA-RAM can close in
                  because it has the IR/UV seeker and its onboard cpu can resolve the incoming
                  AshCm's trajectory and autopilot the missile close into the intecepting target
                  by the missile's aerodynamic design( Rotating). What's your munition's eyes and

                  start of this thread, you claim that an unguided, proximity fused, medium caliber

                  effective.</span></p>

                  why I raised the issue of Strales DART … which is why we had this whole long
                  winded discussion … leading finally (!) to this bit that has to be immortalized

              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial;">That's why
              I don't understand when I said the "eyeless, brainless gun rounds"
              can't compared to primary missile systems then somebody jumped out and asked me
              to read but till the end of the day, someone failed to prove his
              "brain smart" dart round got any future in CIWS.</span></p>

              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial;">I am
              tempted to keep arguing on the Strales DART on the presumption that you will
              also soon come one full circle and contradict yourself.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial;">Since you
              didn’t bother to have the manners to read through others post, the future of
              the Strales DART is <strong>also</strong> being demonstrated by the FREMM frigate program. <span> </span>The FREMM is a Joint Franco-Italian program
              with a 27 ship build plan … not small potatoes by modern ship classes.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial;">The 76SR
              gun was selected for the FREMM on the strength of the Strales DART capability and
              it is intended for the 2-3 mounts per ship to have this capability retrofitted
              when ready.<span>  </span>I’m not joking … 2 x 76SR
              per ship for the French FREMM and 3(!) x 76 SR for the Italian FREMMs.<span>  </span>Wanna question the need for this many
              mounts?<span>  </span></span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial;">Mate, it’s
              not just my opinions.<span>  </span>I have given you
              multiple sources to show how the DART can work.<span>  </span>All you have given is your own, personal and demonstrably flawed,
              opinion that it doesn’t.<span>  </span></span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial;"> Like I said
              previously, various DoDs and project teams, with tons of money at their
              disposal have endorsed it.<span>  </span>If you really
              feel that you are that much of a genius that you know something they don’t, why
              don’t you go apply to work for them and show them their errors?<span>  </span>For that matter, keep you talent at home, apply
              to work for ST. <span> </span>We could certainly use
              someone of your talent in ST.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial;">BTW, during
              the entry interview, don’t forget to mention your thesis on why a CLOS missile
              cannot possibly work against maneuvering air targets.</span></p>

              about how the world only superpower with half of world war chest comes into
              weapon system selection.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial;"> Even comes
              into apple to apple comparison, I don’t understand a DDG-1000 features 2 X57mm
              guns at a speed almost double that of OTO SR 76mm gun can be similar to a
              single gunned frigate for CIWS need? A sheer rate of fire comparison is MK110
              on board DDG-1000 is almost 4 times greater than Formidable class</span></p>

              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial;">I think
              most of us here understand how layer defense works and what is implied by the
              limitations of SARH/CLOS in handling saturation attacks … nice spiel about all
              that but it’s not the point is it?<span>  </span>I’m
              going to wind down my replies now since the original issue about the 76 SR has
              been resolved … so just a quick poser.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial;">With your knowledge
              of weapon system selection and your powerful logical acumen, please tell us why the Mk 110 was chosen?</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial;">If the SM-2/ESSM
              2-layer is deemed good enough to handle <strong>all</strong> anti-air and anti-missile threats, than why select the 57mm Bofors for the role
              of a non-CIWS close protection gun?<span>  </span></span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial;">If the CIGS
              is only for surface targets, than why, of all the choices available, do they
              choose an expensive, deck penetrating gun mount?<span>  </span>There are many other non-penetrating gun
              mounts, of lower caliber, that can offer a more gradated response to asymmetric
              threat environments.<span>  </span>57mm can be a bit
              of an overkill in some instances.<span>  </span></span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial;"> Could it be
              that despite all your fluff about the Zumwalt’s integrated defense network, the
              USN selected the Mk 110 because it has CIWS (CIGS) capabilities and will
              actually give them a 3-layer hard kill anti-missile defense.</span></p>

              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;">A picture is worthy 1000
              words. See a time-speed relation of a typical dog fight AAM:</p>
              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"> </p>

              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"> </p>
              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;">Any maneuvering projectile
              with controlling surface will be identical to the AAM, although the
              curve shape will be somewhat different but won’t be different in
              magnitude.</p>
              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"> </p>
              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;">From the curve, the
              missile reaches its max speed around 2.3-2.4 second when its
              propellant burnt out. However, it loses speed sharply when it’s in
              supersonic region, for a mere 4-5 second it has dropped back into
              subsonic region and hardly has any sheer speed to catch near sound
              speed cruise-missile. </p>
              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"> </p>
              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;">Which speaks out a
              <strong>dart round only lose some 6% speed from the initial speed
              of Mach 3 over 4-5kms is aerodynamic impossible</strong>.</p>
              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"> </p>
              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;">Actually this curve is
              also a good explanation why a high off boresight AAM + HMS is not
              what a “what you can see is what you can shoot” kind of myth.</p>

              <p class="MsoNormal">Mate, as Shotgun has mentioned before, you are only giving
              half the story.<span>  </span>If you are not doing it
              deliberately, than you
              simply lack the depth of knowledge that you accuse other people of.  If, OTOH, you are doing it deliebrately, than it can only mean one thing ... you're being dishonest.</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"> </p>
              <p class="MsoNormal">A question for you then …</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal">Is the speed-time curve you posted for a maneuvering or
              non-maneuvering missile?</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal">The reason why this whole argument dragged (excuse the pun)
              on is because you insisted that sheer aerodynamic drag <strong>alone</strong> will cause the projectile to become subsonic over 5km.</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal">A careful look at the formula for calulating aero drag alone will show you where you are going worng.  But since you don’t believe my calculations, I also posted M829
              APFSDS velocity loss table … to disprove your claim on aerodynamic drag loss in
              straight flight.</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal">If you post a speed-time curve of a maneuvering missile as a direct comparison, now
              that’s being either “no clue” or dishonest.</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"> </p>
              <p class="MsoNormal">In any case, if you claim that the same curve applies for
              the energy state of the DART in similar “unknown” conditions, than how is the
              DART not out-performing the sidewinder?</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"> </p>
              <p class="MsoNormal">From your curve, I can see that the sidewinder is
              accelerating quite linearly to ~650m/s over 2.2s.<span>  </span>So how far has it traveled in that 2.2s?</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal">The original 2km I gave was because I gave the sidewinder
              instant acceleration to top speed … I gave face.<span>  </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal">Thanks to your speed-time curve, we can work out that the
              sidewinder accelerates at <span> </span>295m/s/s for 2.2s.<span>  </span>Motor burn-out and top speed is achieved
              after a flight distance of 325m.<span>  </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal">Unless I muffed my physics … that right 325 meters !<span>  </span>Not 2km.</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal">How long does it take a 1,200m/s DART to travel
              325m?<span>  </span>Let’s call it 0.5s, just to make your
              claim that the RAM missile has a higher energy state more ridiculous …
              according to your speed-time curve, the missile lost about 100m/s of velocity
              in the 0.5 seconds after launch.<span>  </span>That
              works out to be about a 15.4% velocity loss.<span>  </span>Let’s call it 20%.</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal">At 325m distance from the launch platform, your sidewinder
              missile has a velocity of 650m/s.</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal">At the same 325m distance, the DART has a velocity of (1200x0.8)
              = 960m/s.</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal">So, the RAM missile has a higher energy state than the
              DART?<span>  </span>In your dreams mate.</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal">It’s amazing your ability to keep producing little factoids
              that actually do more harm to your arguments.<span>  </span>Seriously … stop calling people “no clue” or “lack of depth .. it's coming back to bite you.  Big Time!</p>

              <p>what the hell with sea-ram ? You think missile defense system is better ?</p>
              <p>Yep our frigate got - <strong>Aster 15 - </strong>Short/medium range surface-air anti-aircraft and anti-missile missile .  - that is one of the most advance missile system , if not better then sea-ram.</p>

              <p>If you think aster 15 + 76mm + decoy  is not good enough - what make you think sea-ram which is also a missile system like aster is better ?</p>
              <p>In May 1996, trials of the Aster 15 active electromagnetical final guidance system against live targets began. All six attempts were successful:</p>

              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;">A picture is worthy 1000 words. See a time-speed relation of a typical dog fight AAM:</p>
              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"> </p>
              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><img src="http://i11.photobucket.com/albums/a184/Military_Pictures/AIM-9LSpeed-timecurve.jpg" alt="" width="800" height="702"></p>
              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"> </p>
              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;">Any maneuvering projectile with controlling surface will be identical to the AAM, although the curve shape will be somewhat different but won’t be different in magnitude.</p>
              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"> </p>
              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;">From the curve, the missile reaches its max speed around 2.3-2.4 second when its propellant burnt out. <span style="color: #ff0000;">However, it loses speed sharply when it’s in supersonic region, for a mere 4-5 second it has dropped back into subsonic region and hardly has any sheer speed to catch near sound speed cruise-missile. </span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"> </p>
              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;">Which speaks out a <strong>dart round only lose some 6% speed from the initial speed of Mach 3 over 4-5kms is aerodynamic impossible</strong>.</p>
              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"> </p>
              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;">Actually this curve is also a good explanation why a high off boresight AAM + HMS is not what a “what you can see is what you can shoot” kind of myth.</p>

              <p>You think people don't know this when they shoot missiles? </p>
              <p>Every weapon out there has an "envelope." This envelope is the minimum and maximum distance the missile can hit depending on target's aspect. (ie. Which way its moving in relation to you, eg towards you, away from you, or perpendicular)  For simplicity's sake, lets called this Rmin1, and Rmax1.</p>
              <p>Now thats simply the amount of "energy" the missile has available to travel, regardless of speed.</p>
              <p>Within this main envelope, lies a secondary and more important envelope.  Its called the NO-ESCAPE-ZONE (NEZ).  This is the distance envelope which when the missile is launched, it will SURELY hit its target as it has sufficient "energy."  Lets called this Rmin2, Rmax2. </p>
              <p>Obviously, a target manuevering under 500kts in the above diagram would be in the Rmin2 , Rmax2 if within the first 2.3 sec when the motor is still burning.  Somewhere after that point, depending on the target's manuevering aspect, would be in Rmin1 and Rmax1.</p>
              <p>In a dogfight or any AAM shoot out, while it makes sense to shoot within the NEZ, we have to be aware that we would also be within the opponents NEZ, so we tend to shoot in the WEZ instead at higher speeds or altitude.</p>
              <p>BUT, when engaging a supersonic missile, nothing its gonna shoot back at us, so, I'd definitely shoot within my NEZ.  As you can see, air-to-air interception and surface to air interception are indeed 2 very different ball games.</p>
              <p>The Sidewinder is a pretty high-drag missile that tops out somewhere under mach 1.8.  Its control surfaces are optimized for manueverability and cause a lot of induced drag. </p>
              <p>If the graphs for the AMRAAM-Cs aren't classified, you'd see a different picture.  The initial deceleration after the motor burn out won't be as steep.  But as it nears the transonic region, you will see a steeper deceleration before it graduals out again as it clears the transonic region.</p>
              <p>The Sidewinder is in no way physically similar to the Strales Dart given its higher drag designed thats more intended for manueverability. </p>

              <p>Supersonic missiles such as the  SS-N-22 Sunburn travel so fast that warships typically only have seconds to react to the missile. The USN was said to have procured some of the Sunburns for the purpose of developing countermeasures for the weapon. It is safe to say that the USN does know of the threat and developed measures to defeat it.</p>
              <p>Now also, the other thing to consider for point defence systems is that a system such as the Phalanx may or may not be 100% effective against a super sonic missile that carries so much momentum that the debris will still strike the ship and potentialy damage equipment. The Arleigh Burkes were built for survivability and damn are they some of the finest ships in the world. Also, the SPY-1D radar isn't the only radar on the ship. There's the SPS-67 surface search radars which can be used to detect sea skimming missiles. The SPY-1D radar has 4 emitters as well. Ultimately with supersonic sea skimming missilse, you are going to need ever single trick in the book to protect the ship. SM-2/3 and Aster-15/30s are simply not enough. You need RAM like the ESSD.</p>

              <p>Since the thread is still much alive…</p>
              <p>The MK110 system in USN is still basically an ASuW against hostile small speed boat or the likes. The DDG1000 is a new era destroyer countering new type of threats, the terrorist. The DDG1000 is designed to accomplish missions in littoral water. So MK110 gun system is primarily tasked to do the job mentioned above. Not the mission of CIWS closely associated with anti-ASCM.</p>
              <p>Look at another vessel designed for littoral water—the LCS, set to replace FFG7. LCS features both MK110 and SEA-RAM, the MK110 is mainly for engaging speedboats pop up in littoral terrain. While the RIM-116 SEA-RAM on board is for what we have discussed so long here—CIWS:</p>
