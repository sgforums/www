I'd like to know what you guys think of the defence capabilities of RSS Formidable class against anti-ship missiles, specifically how come RSN seems to think they don't need CIWS such as Phalanx or Goalkeeper? Most western navies such as Royal Navy (from Falklands experience) and USN (from USS Stark incident) seem to require warships of similar or larger size to have at least 1 CIWS. The similar La Fayette-based Kang Ding has one Phalanx CIWS Block 1A. Even the much smaller Israeli Eliat SA'AR 5 class corvette has one Phalanx CIWS. Considering the price and prestige (as the most advanced/powerful warship in SE Asia), shouldn't they be better protected with one more line of defence, in case an anti-ship missile gets past the Asters and electronic countermeasures to hit the ship?</p></div>

              <p>Does the RSN really think they don't need a CIWS or have they moved on to a CIGS instead?</p>
              <p>As supersonic anti-ships missiles proliferate and the incoming threat gets faster, the need to engage and destroy the AShM further away grows.  This is because these missiles are so big and fast that even if you kill the AShM, IF the "kill" is not done at a sufficient standoff distance, the debris from the missile parts are likely to cause significant collateral damage to the target. </p>
              <p>Because of this, the 20mm Phalanx is starting to be viewed as being inadequate in range and the 30mm Goalkeeper is starting to be viewed as approaching borderline adequate.  The trend among new build vessels is to move away from small calibre CIWS to  either</p>
              <p>i) Short range anti-missile missile such as RAM or (since we're talking about CIWS) ...</p>
              <p>ii) medium calibre "Close In Gun System" or CIGS such as the Bofors 57mm/70
              Mk3 (or Mk 110 in the USN) or the wide spread Oto Melera 76mm/62 Super
              Rapid.</p>
              <p>Which means to say the preference is now for either Missiles or medium calibre CIGS as a final layer of defence against AShM.  So it may be fair to say that <strong>perhaps</strong> the RSN is depending on their Super Rapid 76 to perform the role of final shootdown of AShM</p>

              <p>FYI, several of our PVs and APVs have traded their mistral for 20mm Typhoon. From what I know, it was a trial. I believe at least 1 LST as well. It should become standard weapon soon.</p>

              <p>Mate, sorry to contradict you but the Super Rapid 76/62 is designed to engage sea skimming AShMs as a primary capability.</p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica;">"OTO-Melara estimates
              that, combined with the Dardo FCS, the SR can begin engaging attacking
              missiles at about 6,600 yards (6,000 m), with the first rounds arriving
              on target at 6,000 yards (5,500 m).  With these ranges, a single gun
              can deal with up to four subsonic sea-skimmer missiles, arriving simultaneously
              on courses 90 degrees apart, before any reaches 1,100 yards (1,000 m)."</span></p>

              <p><br>The Phalanx on a USN ship once notoriously opened fire on the USS New Jersey causing casualties.</p>
              <p>And the 76mm is a AA gun. It is actually more effective against air targets than surface targets from first-hand accounts. This gun handles 2 main types of rounds, the MOM and SAPOM round, the former being a flak type and the latter being armour-piercing type.</p>

              <p>well, i doubt .5mg can be really counted as AA weapon lar... at least not anti-missile.... dont think it can engage fast enough to ht the missile.. unless it is a prop plane or smth..or a kite...</p>
              <p>think that .5mg may be called more of as a gen purpose gun for shooting at random stuff that tries to kill you (smth like a small knife lar), but i wont trust a .5mg to stop the missile...</p>

              <p>The good ol R2D2 had 2 modes on the older class of USN ships IIRC. Semi-Auto and Auto.  Semi-Auto will require the operator to assign the track to the R2D2, and clear it to fire when in range.</p>
              <p>The Auto... shoots anything that flies.  Helo better be on deck when that happens...</p>
              <p>If I'm not wrong, if there are missiles inbound, every gun will be tracking them.  Doesn't matter if they are 76mms, or phalanx.  Killing / Spoofing the missile is top priority. </p>

              <p>Sigh .... do you have any valid reason to think that the Oto Melara 76/60, with the FCS, will not be good enough to hit an incoming missile?</p>
              <p>You must have missed the bit posted by 16/f that the MOM (and the newer PF-OM) shells are designed to engage sea skimming missiles.  Go read about it, they are like shotgun shells with tungsten pellets.</p>
              <p>You must have also missed the bit I posted about Oto Melara's test of the SR 76 against 4 incoming missiles from 6,000m.  None of them got any closer than 1,000m ... which is a far sight better than the 200-300m of the Phalanx (and the main reason why the phalanx is deemed inadequate).</p>
              <p>Still not good enough? Why?</p>
              <p>Are you thinking that a ship's CO is gonna wait until the absolute last minute to engage with the SR76?  He certainly won't wait to see if the decoys are working ... He'd fire the ASTER, fire the NGDS (when appropriate) and if the missile is still up at 6,000m hit it with the 76/60. </p>
              <p>I seriously doubt he's going to go ... "I just fired the decoys, lets wait and see" ... "Ooooh it's coming real close, but let's wait and see" .... "OH CB! The decoys are not working! Guns! Engage Missile! 1,000m!" ... Boom?</p>
              <p>In case you still think that the Oto Melara 76 was not designed primarily as an Anti-Missile gun, go read about the DART Strales program which is just now coming operational.</p>
              <p>So seriously ... do you have a valid reasons for your counter points or is it just unsubstantiated arguments for argument's sake?</p>

              <p>the 76mm OTo Melara gun - can fire many types of rounds - the anti air rounds  - it act be more like shotgun or claymore - when it is program to explode send a wall of leads at the missile. With the missile travelling at high speed, even if contact with one of the fragment will cause it to spin out of control. <br> </p>
              <p>Thus 1 rounds is enough to put up a pretty solid wall which will take out any missile.<br> </p>
              <p>It is like clay pigeon shooting is a good example of this works.</p>

              <p>kotay, I see your point and 16/f''s. I'll take your words for it. Thanks.</p>
              <p>I do have one more question - can the 76mm Oto Melara gun cover targets to the back of the ship? It seems to me it has a large blind spot, blocked by the bridge?</p>

              <p><br>No.....for AA. Anti-surface as a secondary function.</p>
              <p>Anyway......yes, the ship can turn. The frigates' turning ability is further enhanced by bow-thrusters.</p>
              <p>Anyway, old-bird may be right for all we know. Apparently the barrel droops whenever the mechanisms inside move and that's gotta affect accuracy to a certain extent. This will certainly be more serious if the target is far away.</p>
