              <p>Hmmm ... so it's an inherent design flaw? </p>
              <p>This despite the Super Rapid 76 being a widely used medium calibre naval gun?  In production since about 1990 with goodness knows how many quantities in actual operational use ... despite it being selected for recent "next generation" vessels such as the Horizon CNGF, FREMM frigates, Skjold FAC, various Meko variants, etc ... surely someone will have blown the whistle by now.</p>
              <p>The problem you described sounds like design flaws in the old 76 Compact mount.  Either that or I am wrong :shrug:</p>

              It is therefore more of an all purpose weapon, but is is not designed specifically to engage ShShMs, although it has capability to do so if required. In this sense, it is not  a true CIWS per se unlike Phalanx, Zenith, Meroka , Millenius which were from the outset designed with the primary purpose of being true last ditch weapons.

              <p>Quote ... "The Oto Melara 76mm naval gun has been primarily designed for anti-missile and anti-aircraft roles, with anti-surface warfare (anti-ship) and naval gun support capability a secondary role."<br><br>And so what does my contradictory quote prove?  Nothing at all ... it's just Semantics really.  At the end of the day does it matter  whether it's a primary or secondary function?  The heart of the matter here is whether the 76 SR can perform the role of final defense against AShM.  If it can do so competently and effectively, who cares if it is primary, secondary, dual-purpose or multi-role?</p>
              <p>As has been said earlier, the so called dedicated CIWS platforms like Phalanx, et al. are being superceded by CIGS or SR Anti-Missile Missiles like SEA-RAM.  For a great example, look no further than the evolution of the Arleigh Burke Class DDGs.  The class started out mounting the Phalanx as the final protective layer.  The most recent evolution, the Flight IIAs no longer carry the phalanx CIWS, it's been replaced by SEA-RAM.  That's almost 20 ships in the last 8 years.</p>
              <p>Take a look around all the new builds coming out of the shipyards ... they mostly do not carry small calibre CIWS anymore ... Phalanx, et al. may be true CIWS "designed with the primary purpose of
              being true last ditch weapons" but that doesn't prevent them from becoming obsolete or being replaced by multi-role systems that can do the same and more.</p>

              <p>It is therefore more of an all purpose weapon, but is is not designed specifically to engage ShShMs, although it has capability to do so if required.

              <p><br>It is more of a AA gun.</p>
              <p>In fact when you look at the figures, it engages air targets better than surface targets, with a greater effective range and hit-rate.</p>
              <p>When you look at the category, it is usually classified as a AA gun.</p>
              <p>FYI, MOM rounds which are the AA rounds, can be converted to SAPOM rounds, but not vice-versa. This makes the gun more flexible as you would not want to load rounds according to the needs. Each round weighs 12-13kg!</p>
              <p>Regarding the barrel-drooping fault, did a run today. Interestingly, when the gun is handed-over to FCS, that does not happen. Seems to be balancer problem.</p>

              <p><br>Don't quite get you....but if I get your drift, you still don't believe the 76mm can do the job?</p>
              <p>The 76mm round is a up-sized bullet, the SRGM is not a artillery piece, this fact, you have to get it right first. Thus it is rather accurate against air-targets as it does not use ballistic trajectory against air-targets. Having flak-type rounds make it more deadly.</p>
              <p>Regarding rate of turn, the frigate can turn around completely in less than a minute, without bow-thrusters. And since a launch of a missile is usually detected fairly quickly, I don't see how it is disadvantaged by using a 76mm even with a blind-arc zone.</p>
              <p>Thus said, I understand all your concerns, I used to think this way too.</p>

              <p>Well, thats where the frigate's radar-evading features come in helpful.  Besides, those missiles I mentioned were Carrier-Killers, not used on small lil things like frigates.</p>
              <p>Against SURTAS, long range maritime patrol craft will scan the seas with their radar.  They find a group, they call in the rain.  The missiles will fly to predetermined coordinates near the task force, initiate a pop up to look for its targets (any target) and kill them.</p>
              <p>So imagine, those missiles coming in from multiple axes... fricking high-explosive air-show man.</p>

              <p><br>Not necessarily to be the case, anti-radiation missiles like KH-31P or AGM-88 can actually ride on your own beams instead of hoping “lit-up” by other side.</p>
              <p>Furthermore, AshCMs are usually active radar guided which means the AshCM will only light up you at the terminal stage when its own seeker comes into play. The “lighting up” time is rather short for any comfortable reaction.</p>
              <p>As for the Super Rapid 76mm gun, with its 0.3mils accuracy and 120rounds per min MAXIMUM, it’s Damn good, but just not good enough to totally/primarily replace a traditional CIWS’s role. Think about it, an even sub-sonic AshCM can have a typical terminal speed of Mach0.8-0.9, An OTO SR 76mm is 0.5 second per shot, during which of slice time, the anti-ship missile can travel 100-160m, on the other hand, the ASHCM is NOT following a ballistic trajectory, so you won't know the next 0.5 second, the missile would go straight or slightly turn/dive or pop up or accelerate. And making the things worse, bigger caliber guns are always advertised to be more capable to intercept AshCM at a longer distance. But longer distance makes the salvo taking more seconds to cover, which to an agile AshCM, the pre-emptively assumed intercepting point could well be changed during even several seconds. That’s the reason, only a guided AA missile with “lock on” ability plays the CIWS role much handier than the bigger gun, that’s the reason a Phalanx can only correctly/principally/primarily being replaced by SEA-RAM with IR/UV seeker, not a 76mm gun shooting munitions with no eye and poor brain</p>

              <p><br>Not necessarily to be the case, anti-radiation missiles like KH-31P or AGM-88 can actually ride on your own beams instead of hoping “lit-up” by other side.</p>
              <p>Furthermore, AshCMs are usually active radar guided which means the AshCM will only light up you at the terminal stage when its own seeker comes into play. The “lighting up” time is rather short for any comfortable reaction.</p>
              <p>As for the Super Rapid 76mm gun, with its 0.3mils accuracy and 120rounds per second MAXIMUM, it’s Damn good, but just not good enough to totally/primarily replace a traditional CIWS’s role. Think about it, an even sub-sonic AshCM can have a typical terminal speed of Mach0.8-0.9, An OTO SR 76mm is 0.5 second per shot, during which of slice time, the anti-ship missile can travel 100-160m, on the other hand, the ASHCM is NOT following a ballistic trajectory, so you won't know the next 0.5 second, the missile would go straight or slightly turn/dive or pop up or accelerate. And making the things worse, bigger caliber guns are always advertised to be more capable to intercept AshCM at a longer distance. But longer distance makes the salvo taking more seconds to cover, which to an agile AshCM, the pre-emptively assumed intercepting point could well be changed during even several seconds. That’s the reason, only a guided AA missile with “lock on” ability plays the CIWS role much handier than the bigger gun, that’s the reason a Phalanx can only correctly/principally/primarily being replaced by SEA-RAM with IR/UV seeker, not a 76mm gun shooting munitions with no eye and poor brain</p>

              <p><br>I never really said that the CIWS does not fill a niche role in that.</p>
              <p>But it is wrong to say that the 76mm has no eye and poor brain. It is also wrong to say that the 76mm is simply incapable of doing its primary AA role. And where the 76mm lacks in rpm, it more than makes up in the type of munition used. And for a gun that trains at 60 degree per second, why can't it engage more than 1 missile at any one time?</p>
              <p>Thus said, I still find the CIWS rather cool and like you guys, also wish to see it on our ships. But not because the 76mm is inadequete, although it won't be wrong to say that it is not quite adequete. It still needs support from decoys and AMMs for the whole picture to work. A good control of the ship and its systems can also tip the scales.</p>
