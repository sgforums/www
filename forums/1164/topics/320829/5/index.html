              <p> </p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial;">First up, this thread is about "Does Formidable need CIWS".<span> </span> For this, there are 2 rather simple answers -</span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial;">a) Yes, it needs one.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial;">b) No, it does not need one. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial;">It is not about what CIWS is the best.  </span> <span style="font-family: Arial;">Did I or anyone in this thread mention that CIGS is superior to Close in Missile Systems (CIMS) like SEA-RAM?<span> </span> Since you cannot be bothered to read other people's post, I'll summarise my postings in this thread for you.</span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial;">i) Traditional small calibre CIWS, like Phalanx, are fast becoming ineffective against modern AShM threats.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial;">ii) The current trend for inner-layer final protection against missiles is starting to tend towards medium calibre CIGS or Missile systems (which I will hereafter call Close in Missile Systems or CIMS) ;)</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial;">iii) The Oto Melera 76SR mounted by the Formidables is actually a very effective CIGS.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial;">iv) As such, the Formidable does not need to mount a CIWS as it already has one in the form of the 76SR CIGS.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial;">If you wish to start your own argument that a CIMS is the best solution than kindly start your own thread.</span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial;">If you wish to question whether the Oto Melara 76/62 is an effective CIGS, as advertised, than I'll be more than happy to discuss this further since it will relate directly to the question of "Does Formidable need CIWS". </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial;">So now to a point by point answer to your above diatribe</span></p>

              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;"> </span></p>

              <p><br>SEA-RAM has a tracked record of intercepting many types of AshCM simulating rounds including sopersonic ones. the plain fact is it's now adopted and going to be adopted by all major western navies as a standard CIWS, yet you want to equal it to the Dart round which till now so far only managed to keep the pace with a guidance beam in a matter of "5kms". nice mindset. but here do got capable people can fully understand what a crap logic behind the comparison</p>

              <p>one final reply today, keep it short: I don't know? obviously u don't know I talked this with YF more than a years ago:</p>
              <p><a href="http://militarynuts.com/index.php?showtopic=1237&amp;st=30">http://militarynuts.com/index.php?showtopic=1237&amp;st=30</a></p>
              <p>If you fully understand how a air drag can bring down the speed in supersonic region in my last several replies, the biggest difference between a powered and unpowered round is its best energy state appears totally different, a best energy state later is much more in advantage than the one appears at the beginning because interception always happening near terminal stage, 2 kms can make the whole wolrd different, considering the SEA-RAm's max intercetion range is up to 10kms. effect range will be much shorter than max range. that's why YF then think AIM-9X can be effect near BVR, but actual kills all happen very shortly, for AIM-9X, 2-3kms, real WVR.</p>

              <p><br>38, I think you're only giving half the story.</p>
              <p><em>Sharp rise in aerodynamic drag that occurs as an aircraft approaches the speed of sound.</em></p>
              <p> What you are talking about, I believe is called transonic drag. It is the drag that increases exponentially in the transonic region. That is why it is hard for aircraft with a CAT 3 load to break the sound barrier.</p>

              <p> If you look at this graph, you will notice that the drag coefficient drops off after it passes the transonic region. It is only within this transonic region, will you have such a steep rise in drag coefficient.</p>
              <p>So therefore, your statement:</p>
              <p><em>Actually any unpowered supersonic projectile lost speed exponentially faster during its flight in supersonic region than it does in low speed region.</em></p>
              <p>... is largely inaccurate. An object will encounter exponential slowdown ONLY WITHIN THE TRANSONIC region as shown in the graph above. That means staying out of Mach 0.95 and Mach 1.05.</p>
              <p>If there is an exponential increase of drag throughout the supersonic region, aircraft will not be able to super-cruise because they will constantly require MORE POWER to maintain supersonic flight. Don't you think so?</p>

                  fabulous own goal by 38 … Sea Wolf is like SM-1 you say? Totally different from
                  DART rounds?<span>  </span>And you say the difference
                  is because Seawolf has got a seeker and brains – like any normal anti-air missile.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial;">Mate, go
                  have a read at MBDA’s Seawolf’s brochure.<span>  </span>Let me quote some relevant bits for you …</span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="color: #0000ff;"><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial;">“Once the
                  surveillance radar has detected targets, the ship's Command System evaluates
                  them and prioritises the threat. Designated high threat targets are then
                  automatically passed to the SEAWOLF tracker sub-system, which then searches for
                  and locks onto the priority target. <strong>The
                  system</strong> automatically decides upon missile launch and <strong>guides the SEAWOLF missile to intercept using highly accurate Command
                  to Line of Sight (CLOS) guidance</strong>.”</span></span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"> </p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="color: #0000ff;"><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial;">“the
                  missile is controlled by its rear fins, giving it high manoeuvrability. The <strong>rear-facing command aerials</strong> mounted on
                  the missile wings make it extremely resistant to electronic countermeasures.”</span></span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial;"> </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal">In other words, <span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial;">the
                  shipboard fire control system provides the guidance instructions to the Seawolf Missile
                  directly from the beams to it’s rear facing RF aerials … exactly like the Strales DART.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial;"> The SM-1, on the other hand,
                  has it’s SARH seeker facing forward and calculates it’s own
                  guidance from the reflected signals from the target</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial;"> The litany

              <p><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: black;">When the
              projectile’s speed is in the supersonic region. Because of the sharp rise in
              Cx, the projectile approaching sound speed will have to break sound barrier.
              Actually any unpowered supersonic projectile lost speed exponentially faster
              during its flight in supersonic region than it does in low speed region.
              Remember, it lost speed exponentially, 6% is not a exponential result
              considering the dart round already flied 5kms. </span><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial;"></span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial;">Obviously
              your lack of knowledge leads to your totally incompetent to talk something you
              really don’t understand. </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial;">*snip*</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial;">Why it’s so
              difficult to achieve a Dart round to just entering the guidance beam in just
              5+kms distance? Because the Dart round has already lost most of its speed
              during supersonic flight ( from m3 inital speed to sub-sonic)</span></p>

              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial;"> </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: black;">So you are
              saying that the DART round has gone from 1,200m/s to less than 345m/s
              (speed of sound at sea level) within 5km due to the exponential effect of velocity
              on aerodynamic drag.<span>  </span>Brilliant!</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: black;">38, I sometimes
              think you really have no appreciation for maths … I mean you can certainly name
              some concepts but you don’t seem to have an appreciation of the equation
              details or it’s real world applications.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial;">Firstly, stop trying to get
              all your answers from wikipedia or answers.com … if you want a better
              understanding of aerodynamics and supersonic flight, go read from NASA.<span>  </span>I’ll even point you in the right direction … grc.nasa.gov/WWW/K-12/airplane/short.html</span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial;">Like I said, there are ballistics calculators
              online.<span>  </span>But if you don’t believe them,
              then consider the following velocity degradation for a M829 APFSDS <span> </span>(figures provided by Paul Lakowski)</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial;">0000m<span>   </span>=<span>   </span>1670m/s</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial;">1000m<span>   </span>=<span>   </span>1610m/s</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial;">2000m<span>   </span>=<span>   </span>1551m/s</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial;">3000m<span>   </span>=<span>   </span>1491m/s</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial;">4000m<span>   </span>=<span>   </span>1432m/s</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial;">This is a
              Fin Stabilised Discarding Sabot round with similar Cd (Drag Coefficient) to the Strales DART with
              a significantly higher velocity – approximately twice the V2 value of the
              1200m/s DART.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial;"> I don’t see
              the degradation to sub-sonic within 5km.<span>  </span></span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: black;">I'll let you in on something to make you happy.<span>  </span>I left the
              range at the default of 2000m in the ballistics calculator, which is why I got
              6%.<span>  </span><strong>I made a mistake </strong>... Happy?</span><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial;"><span></span>  The actual figure for a 1,200m/s DART is about 14% over 5km.<span>  </span>Which is still about 1000m/s or roughly 3
              times the speed of sound … hardly sub-sonic issit?</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial;"> So I think
              I’ll just add one more to your growing list of own-goals …</span></p>

                  a tracked record of intercepting many types of AshCM simulating rounds

              <p>Joe, sorry if your answer gets lost amongst the crap slinging match above :)</p>
              <p>I should have been more clear in my original statement ... Phalanx CIWS was removed from new build IIAs from DDG-85 onwards.  The criteria, IINM, is the incorporation of ESSM into new builds starting with DDG-85.  Add one missile layer, remove one gun layer?</p>
              <p>That being said, some Post DDG-85 Flight IIAs have had a single Blk 1B CIWS added back in.  I suspect this may have to do with deployment to the gulf, given that the IIAs now lack suitable counters against small terrorist boats ... and the Blk 1B fits the bill.  My 2c.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>WRT to the Israeli LCS, I have no clue.  LCS-1 and LCS-2 do not specify Phalanx CIWS in their mix, although I hesistate to mention this since the LCS loadout is yet to be writ in stone.</p>
              <p>I can only venture an opinion that perhaps the INS has a different mission profile or mindset.  The INS is rather strange, they are about the only peeps, AFAIK, that mounts the Phalanx as an A gun.</p>

              <p>If FlightIIA refers to the newer Burkes with the submerged smoke
                  stacks, then the picture you showed us is not of the new Burke.</p>

              <p>I think the following should clarify the Flight IIA confusion ...</p>
              <p>As per Joe Black, Flight IIA starts with DDG-79</p>
              <p>2 ships later, with DDG-81, it gets a Mk45 Mod 4 upgrade to enable it to use ERGM munitions.</p>
              <p>4 ships later, with DDG-85, due to delays, it finally gets ESSM and the Phalanx are deleted from design.</p>
              <p>4 ships later, with DDG-89, the superstructure gets signature managed resulting in the submerged smoke stacks.</p>
              <p>2 ships later, with DDG-91, the superstructure gets altered again for the inclusion of the AN/WLD-1 Remote Mine-Hunting System.  This is for a limited 6 ship run up till DDG-96</p>
              <p>Those, AFAIK, are the salient visual differences within the Flight IIA series of ships ...</p>

              <p>Yes.  Ours is the Bofors 57/70 Mk 1 ... not suitable for CIWS role.</p>
              <p>The USN selected Mk 110 is the Bofors 57/70 Mk 3 ... 2 generations and 30 years apart.</p>

              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;">A picture is worthy 1000 words. See a time-speed relation of a typical dog fight AAM:</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"> </p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><img src="http://i11.photobucket.com/albums/a184/Military_Pictures/AIM-9LSpeed-timecurve.jpg" alt="" width="800" height="702"></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"> </p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;">Any maneuvering projectile with controlling surface will be identical to the AAM, although the curve shape will be somewhat different but won’t be different in magnitude.</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"> </p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;">From the curve, the missile reaches its max speed around 2.3-2.4 second when its propellant burnt out. However, it loses speed sharply when it’s in supersonic region, for a mere 4-5 second it has dropped back into subsonic region and hardly has any sheer speed to catch near sound speed cruise-missile. </p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"> </p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;">Which speaks out a <strong>dart round only lose some 6% speed from the initial speed of Mach 3 over 4-5kms is aerodynamic impossible</strong>.</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"> </p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;">Actually this curve is also a good explanation why a high off boresight AAM + HMS is not what a “what you can see is what you can shoot” kind of myth.</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"> </p>
