              <p><span style="font-family: Arial;"><strong>POINT 2 - CLOS GUIDANCE</strong></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial;"> </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial;">Firstly, I did not say that a CLOS guided Strales DART is better than a ARH/SARH missile ... go read my post carefully.<span> </span> What I did say is that the Strales DART is good enough to do it's job.<span> </span> Don't change the argument just because you can't disprove the point.</span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial;">Back to CLOS guided missiles.</span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial;"> Your opinion will matter if it is credible and this is where my respect for the credibility of your opinion takes another nose dive.<span> </span> How much do you actually understand of CLOS guidance of Surface-to-Air Missiles (SAM)?<span> </span> Do you have any idea what you are talking about when you spew such nice technical terms as "3-point guidance"?</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial;"> Your post seems to imply that the Target, The tracker and the Missile must all fall in a straight line ... if the missile deviates from this straight line, it loses the beam and becomes an unguided dart.<span> </span> If that is what you are saying, you couldn't be further from the truth.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial;"> CLOS of missiles relies on a "3-beam guidance" principle.<span> </span> The 3 beam implies a Wide Beam, a Medium beam and a Narrow beam.<span> </span> The wide beam, as the name implies, is a broad beam that is meant to cover a large cone and allow the missile to remain in guidance when the beam moves violently - such as when tracking a high-g/speed target.<span> </span> As the missile flies along the Wide beam, it attempts to navigate progressively towards the more focused, and accurate, narrow beam - which is focused on the target itself.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial;">This basic "3-beam guidance" principle is why CLOS SAMs do work.<span> </span> It is rather disingenious of you to only quote ATGMs and try to delude people into thinking that beam riders do not work against fast moving targets.<span> </span> You seem to be either ignorant of or have deliberately "forgotten" about a whole family of CLOS SAMs from the RBS70 to the most recent StarStreak.</span></p>
              <p>Nice try but please stop the BS-ing.</p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial;">The issue with CLOS SAMs is NOT as you claim, the inability of the missile to follow the beam.<span> </span> The actual problem is rather to do with the ability of the operator to keep the beam on the target.<span> </span> Given that the Strales uses a Ka band radar to guide the beam, maintaining the beam locked on the missile is not a problem for the Strales Dart.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial;">Go have a read on "Post-flight Analysis and Design Improvement in Command Guidance System for a Short-range Surface-to-air Missile System - Defence Research &amp; Development Laboratory, 2005".</span></p>

              <p>I’m wondering who put   “ <span style="color: #0000ff;">Think of it in terms of a Semi-Active homing missile ... heck, it practically is a semi-active missile.  If you think that is a problem, what do you think the mainstay of the USN missile defence - standard and ESSM - are? SARH</span>!” Bsing 1st . now back paddled.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Yap, CLOS used for MANPAP, a good compliment to ATGM, and RB700, hardly impressive compared to SM-2/ESSM or any other capable SAM/AAM like AIM-120/AIM-9X using proportional Guidance that also find in SEA-RAM. I think one doesn’t need specific knowledge to know CLOS is the simplest and most incapable to handle though targets compared to the one used in RAM and other major AAM/SAMs</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Also wondering how a plain explanation on CLOS arrives you the guidance is as good as the modern ones. The Ka band is a narrow one, the CW tracking the Target is a narrow beam only compared to the one tracking the Dart round is “wider “. The bottom line is LOS is rotating especially trying to track a high speed, maneuverable target, that put any slight beam angel change a dramatic misalignment of the missile. Any misalignment demands the most of the interceptor’s turn rate to correct it. As a matter of fact, the CLOS compared to proportional guidance, demands much higher turn rate of the interceptor compared to Proportional guidance used by majority Anti-air missiles including SEA-RAM if the target is in high speed and maneuverable.</p>

              <p><span style="font-family: Arial;">First things first, since when is a G-of-maneuver measured solely on speed alone?<span> </span></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial;">G-m relies on 2 components – speed and angle of turn.<span>  Actually t</span></span><span style="font-family: Arial;">here are other factors that affect this, such as aerodynamic, structural, and buffet limits, but let’s keep it simple for now.</span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial;">What I'm trying to get at is that you can pull a 9g at 450knots just as you can pull a 9g turn at 750knots … the only difference will be the turn radius.</span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial;">Basic physics … don’t believe me? 2 words for you to google … “Centripetal Acceleration”.<span> </span></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial;">Second thing about this statement.<span> </span> The DART round is effectively a Fin Stablised Discarding Sabot (FSDS) round.<span> </span> Go google up a ballistics calculator and figure out how much a 15:1 dart with an ogive nose loses in air speed over 5km … only about 6%.<span> </span> The DART round actually has an unguided range of up to 38km against other targets ,,, this gives you an indication that the ballistics degradation is not as severe as you imply it to be.</span></p>

              <p>38kms, yap, areodynamic matter can be calculated by a geunis like u, quote a source from OTO to put someone's foot into his mouth, wondering why OTO till now now achieve the Dart round of guidable distance of 5km +, source from OTO website, only don't be disturbed by the word"beyond" as one wonder why don't put 6/7kms "beyond"</p>

              <p><span style="color: #3366ff;">29th November 2005 – Within the Strales program, Oto Melara, a Finmeccanica company, has successfully performed some important firing trials in PISQ (Poligono Interforze Salto di Quirra), an Italian interservice firing range located in Sardinia. </span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #3366ff;">The Strales system, currently in full scale engineering development under the funding of the Italian Navy, is based on the installation on the 76 SR Oto Melara gun of a Radio Frequency (RF) guidance beam capable to steer a burst of sub-calibre DART projectiles against subsonic and supersonic antiship missiles with excellent manoeuvre capability. </span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #3366ff;">During the firing trials, the DART projectiles have correctly entered and followed the guidance beam manoeuvring with the required and expected </span><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>accuracy beyond a range of 5 Km. </strong></span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #3366ff;">This important result is a decisive milestone since it has experimentally proved the capability of a high speed subcalibre projectile to be guided with the highest accuracy. </span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #3366ff;">The end of the development is foreseen in 2007. </span></p>

                  good enough to do the job required.<span>  Stop trying to change the topic just because you're losing this one.   </span></span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal">Seriously, <span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial;">since you have previously asked
                  others to "look carefully", can you please take your own advice and
                  please go read through other peoples post carefully?</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial;"> I'll tackle the issue of
                  proportional guidance below your next paragraph quoted below ...</span></p>

              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial;">Also wondering how a plain
                  explanation on CLOS arrives you the guidance is as good as the modern ones. The
                  Ka band is a narrow one, the CW tracking the Target is a narrow beam only
                  compared to the one tracking the Dart round is “wider “. The bottom line is LOS
                  is rotating especially trying to track a high speed, maneuverable target, that
                  put any slight beam angel change a dramatic misalignment of the missile. Any
                  misalignment demands the most of the interceptor’s turn rate to correct it. As
                  a matter of fact, the CLOS compared to proportional guidance, demands much
                  higher turn rate of the interceptor compared to Proportional guidance used by
                  majority Anti-air missiles including SEA-RAM if the target is in high speed and
                  maneuverable.</span></p>

              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial;">First up, the Ka band radar is not the
                  guidance beam ... Jeez, can you read properly?<span>  </span>As was said in my previous post, the Ka Band Radar <strong>GUIDES</strong> the guidance beam.  The guidance beam is actually a seperate 4-lobe RF transmitter</span><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial;">.<br></span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial;">You really are quite the charlatan ...
                  first throwing up the spiel about how "the intercepting missile has to be
                  at least 4-5 times G load than the missile it suppose to catch" and now
                  this bit about "proportional guidance".</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"> </p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial;">Can you stop throwing out all this
                  catchphrases and please sit down and try to understand what you are quoting ...
                  for once?</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial;"> For those who do not already know,
                  Proportional guidance refers to an intercept algorithm for missiles to lead the
                  target instead of aiming directly at the target.<span>  </span>Undoubtedly this is relevant as all missiles
                  will expend unneccesary energy chasing after the target if it was aimed
                  directly at it ... think in terms of how when you throw a ball at someone
                  running across from you (hamtam bola), you lead them and not throw directly at
                  them.<span>  </span>If you throw directly at them,
                  your ball will pass behind them.<span>  </span>If your
                  ball was a missile, it will have to expend energy to turn and chase after the
                  target.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial;"> Here comes the interesting bit about
                  proportional guidance that 38 doesn't seem to understand.<span>  </span>If someone in hantam bola is running directly
                  at you, do you have to lead them?<span>  </span>The
                  answer is obviously NO!<span>  </span>Proportional
                  Guidance is only relevant when the target is crossing the path of the missile
                  doing the chasing.<span>  </span>In the case of a
                  front-on or rear-on engagement, proportional guidance is IRRELEVANT!</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial;"> Now 38, stop being so dense for a
                  moment and start thinking about what I said in my last post about how the end
                  game for an AShM has one overriding directive ... it must hit the f**king
                  target.<span>  </span>Which means it must start to
                  come head-on relative to any stuff flying out from the target ... which means
                  Proportional engagement is a lot less relevant for a CIWS/CIGS/CIMS … which
                  means the latest Red Herring that you've thrown out is just another lot of pure
                  unadulterated BS again.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial;"> You seem to be caught up in all
                  these "rules" that you've read about air-to-air combat and trying to
                  apply it to a AShM - Ship engagement.<span>  </span>Can you not understand that these 2 scenarios have very different
                  parameters and that some of your carefully memorised rules do not apply here?</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial;"> Take for instance the bit about how
                  the intercepting missile has to be 4-5 times more maneuverable than the target
                  ... do you even understand the parameters behind this *ahem*
                  "rule"?<span>  </span>In a crossing intercept,
                  yes the interceptor must pull a heck of a lot of Gs to catch a target turning
                  into it.<span>  </span>This represents a worst case
                  scenario.<span>  </span></span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial;"> In a rear-on intercept, the
                  interceptor does not need to be 4-5 times more maneuverable.<span>  </span>Depending on the speed differential, it only
                  needs to be about 2-3 times more maneuverable to prevent it from overshooting
                  the target while attempting to turn with the target.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial;"> A front-on intercept represents a
                  best case scenario for an interceptor.<span>  </span>It only needs to match the maneuverability of the target.<span>  </span>I did some simple maths using your case of a
                  15G, 700m/s AShM and a 20G, 1200m/s DART when I got home ... guess what, your
                  AShM is toast.<span>  </span>Just to help you out, the
                  angle rate of turn of the AShM in the above case is 12 degree/sec while the
                  DART is 10 degree/sec.<span>  </span>Go do the maths
                  yourself if you don't believe me ... I’ve done the hard bit for you, all that’s
                  left is for you to do some simple sine &amp; cosine.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial;">Please for goodness sake ... understand that air-to-air combat is not the same ball game as AShM shootdown.  The parameters are quite different.  As I've asked before, please provide concrete proof of the nature of this evasive maneuvers being carried out by your HighG AShMs.  How many turns do you think a 700m/s, 15G missile can complete from 6,000m out ... the answer will surprise you.<br></span></p>

              <p>Wah... so chim, proportional guidance...  WOOT!</p>
              <p>I just call it, "Lead-Pursuit."  Or rather, in the case of missiles, "pure pursuit."  The missile will calculate sufficient lead to bring it on a collision course with the target.</p>
              <p>If you guys really appreciate the mathematics, dydx behind it, please follow this link.</p>
              <p><a href="http://books.google.com.sg/books?id=NVEtqShrgvkC&amp;pg=PA182&amp;lpg=PA182&amp;dq">http://books.google.com.sg/books?id=NVEtqShrgvkC&amp;pg=PA182&amp;lpg=PA182&amp;dq</a></p>
              <p>I believe i saw it Singapore Polytechnic's Central Library once.</p>
              <p><br>I don't appreciate the maths of it.  I prefer to shoot the missile and consider the rest of it "voodoo." I don't have to calculate the dydx to know that the bright speck out there missile with my name painted on it.  If its bearing is constant and doesn't change significantly, you WILL KNOW the missile is coming at you. </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>AShM's can be a little tricky though.  Sometimes when the target is well within the missile's max range, and if the missile supports it ( eg later blocks of Harpoons), the missile can be set to fly multiple waypoints to confuse tracking radars.  With a good number of these slimy bastards coming in, it can screw up target prioritization.</p>
              <p>Of course, a good system like the AEGIS would probably just blow everything else up.</p>

              <p>Flight IIA Arleigh Burke DDGs are no longer being built with Phalanx.  That's close to 20 hulls launched since ~2000.  New designs like the San Antonio LPD likewise have ditched Phalanx for RAM.  Future builds like the Zummwalt will likewise not mount Phalanx.  Quite a few new build European designs likewise have ditched the small calibre Phalanx/Goalkeeper CIWS.</p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">[edit: I'm not too sure, but IINM, the Zumwalt does not even carry RAM but instead has opted for a CIGS in the form of the Bofor 57]<br></span></p>
              <p>I won't claim this is indicative of a trend but it is food for thought.</p>
              <p>One thing to consider about the 76SR is that for a space constrained small vessel like a Corvette of Light Frigate, it provides the ability to cover both ASu and AA roles in one neat package.  Whether 76SR is better or lousier than the RAM is not the issue.  When you have only got space for one system, what are your choices?</p>

              <p><br>Frankly even if you have the CIWS if is only as good if the ship radar is able to detect and track multiple targets and co-ordinates the actions of each CIWS. <br><br>The chance of anyone firing 5 missile at a frigate is a very unlikely event, but in this case - we would assume the missile all will be coming from different angle. Yes the 76mm does have its blind spot - it cannot cover the rear of the ship, other then that, i think it will have no problem putting up wall of lead in between the missiles and the ships.  For those blind spot and missile that may get through, we just have to depend on the decoys to auto deploy to draw away the missiles.</p>

Sea Wolf.<br><br>Sea Wolf is a CLOS guided SAM designed for point defense against aerial targets in the 1970's.  Let me say again .. 1970's.  It performed admirably well in the Falklands in 1982, shooting down low flying, maneuvering aircrafts.  It recorded 2 confirmed + 3 probables from 8 launches.  Mind you, this was a 70's tech missile, around the same time when AAMs in Vietnam were recording single digit percentile success.<br><br>What this is meant to show is that 40 years ago, CLOS SAMs have been able to ride their guidance beam succesfully to hit maneuvering aircraft.  And you still want to insist this is not possible?</p>
              <p>40 years on, refinements have been made to it's algorithm and guidance modules to further enlarge it's engagement envelope against faster, more maneuverable targets.  The concept of a CLOS guided dart as opposed to a powered missile is not new either.  StarStreak is effectively 3 unpowered FSDS darts (like the Strales DART) and has been in service since 1997.  <br><br>And yet there are doubting Thomases that still insist that a CLOS guided dart/missile is unable to maintain beam guidance when doing hard maneuvers.<br><br>For 38, before you get carried away, I will stress again, this is not about whether RAM is better or not.  It's simply about whether the 76SR can do it's job as advertised ... something you have been insisting that it can't.<br><br>Let me help you out here, if you really want to argue against CLOS SAM solutions, you are barking up the wrong tree by insisting that it can't handle high speed/maneuvering targets because it can.  What you really want to argue about is it's ability to handle saturation attacks.</p>

              <p>38's FIXATION ON HIGH-G ANTI SHIP MISSILES<br><br>I'm still waiting for your clarification with regards to your insistence on High-G AShM in the terminal phase.  Namely -<br>i) What proof do you have that AShM engage in agressive high-G maneuvers while in the terminal phase?<br>ii) What value do you ascribe to a AShM conducting high-G evasive maneuvers while in the terminal phase?<br><br>The reason why I question you in this way is because I strongly doubt the applicability of the high-g/speed theory that you keep repeating.  My reasons are simple.</p>
              <p><br><strong>a) PHYSICS</strong><br>The physics involved in turning an aircraft/missile at high speed limits the effectiveness of such maneuvers, especially when you consider the tight constraints on the terminal phase of an inbound AShM.<br><br>Taking your parameters of a 15G, 700m/s missile at 5,000m from the target.  The AShM can complete only a single turn of ~26 degrees off axis before it must start turning back ~60 degrees in order to hit the target.  That is a single turn of 26 degrees, in a highly predictable sinosuidal curve.  Hardly something that will tax the ability of any CIWS to take out.<br><br>If you want to talk about multiple jinks than the amplitudes will have to be much smaller.  Where the amplitudes are much smaller, the missile is likewise much easier to engage.</p>
              <p><br><strong>b) PREDICTABILITY<br></strong><br>AFAIK, no AShMs currently have the ability to detecting incoming rounds/missiles and take reactive evasive maneuvers.  All AShMs evasive maneuvers are currently non-reactive and pre-programmed.  I heresay that Exocet was developing a model that would exploit the closed loop targeting algorithm of the Phalanx but AFAIK, nothing came of that either.<br><br>Because the AShMs evasive maneuvers are non-reactive, they are less effective.  You really can't take your precious "rules" based on reactive air combat maneuvers and  transplant them here. <br><br>What is even more important is that the closer the missile gets to the target, the more it's maneuvers become predictable since it must start turning back into the target or miss altogether.  Where the maneuvers become predictable, it becomes much more within the algorithm of the CIWS to intercept, hit and kill.</p>
              <p><br><br><strong>c) SELF DEFEAT</strong><br>What I find most interesting about your trumpeting of High-G/Speed maneuvering is your lack of realisation that it is ultimately self defeating. </p>
              <p>Don't believe me?  A presentation by Raytheon on the Phalanx Blk 1B upgrade showed a rather interesting test result.  Raytheon presented that the CIWS was actually more effective against a maneuvering supersonic AShM than a non-maneuvering AShM.<br><br>When one thinks about this logicaly, there are various reasons why this may be true:</p>
              <ul>
              <li>A maneuvering AShM spends more time in the lethal zone of the CIWS as compared to a straight running AShM.  More time equates more engagement cycles equates more kills.</li>
              <li>A maneuvering AShM presents a larger target to the CIWS.  When it turns, it presents more of it's flank and becomes a bigger target whereas a head-on AShM presents only the cross-section as a target area.</li>
              <li>More importantly, a maneuvering AShM is rarely pointed at the target.  What this means is that if a hit by the CIWS only suceeds in taking out the seeker head, the non-maneuvering AShM will still cary on flying straight and true towards the target.  The maneuvering AShM OTOH, if it suffers a hit on the seeker head or control surfaces will no loger be able to pull itself back to the target and will most probably miss.  In other words, a non-maneuvering AShM will require a catastrophic hit to take out while a maneuvering AShM will only require a partial hit to m-kill it.</li>
              </ul>
              <p><br>So based on all the above, I will ask you again, why do you keep insisting on agressively High-G maneuvers by AShM in it's terminal phase?  Is there something we don't know or are you spouting more textbook nonsense?</p>

              <p>Lol, another no clue!</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Sea wolf is a beam rider similar to SM-1, the difference is it got eyes(seekers" and brains like any normal anti-air missile),  totally different from the Dart round without any eyes or poor brain(no drain if u consider the RF reciever a non-AI unit)</p>

              <p>ok, according to http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/systems/ship/ddg-51-flt2a.htm, Flight IIA starts from DDG 79 and the one in the photos is DDG 81.</p>

              <p><span style="color: black; font-family: Arial;">The statement of a mach 3 unpowered projectile near sea level only lost 6% of its initial speed over 5kms really showcase you have no clue about aerodynamics yet want to talk like expert.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: black; font-family: Arial;">Air drag coefficient Cx considered almost constant when the projectile flies at low speed ( generally below 250m/s), and increases near exponentially along with the increase of speed which is near or over speed of the sound. </span></p>
              <p><span style="color: black; font-family: Arial;"><a href="http://www.answers.com/topic/sonic-barrier?cat=technology">http://www.answers.com/topic/sonic-barrier?cat=technology</a></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;"><strong>Sharp rise in aerodynamic drag that occurs as an aircraft approaches the speed of </strong></span><a href="http://www.answers.com/topic/sound-1"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0000ff; font-family: Times New Roman;"><strong>sound</strong></span></span></a><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">. At sea level the speed of sound is about 750<span style="color: black; font-family: Arial;"></span></span></p>
              <p><span style="color: black; font-family: Arial;"> </span></p>
              <p><span style="color: black; font-family: Arial;">When the projectile’s speed is in the supersonic region. Because of the sharp rise in Cx, the projectile approaching sound speed will have to break sound barrier. Actually any unpowered supersonic projectile lost speed exponentially faster during its flight in supersonic region than it does in low speed region. Remember, it lost speed exponentially, 6% is not a exponential result considering the dart round already flied 5kms. </span></p>
              <p><span style="color: black; font-family: Arial;"><span> </span><span> </span></span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">Obviously your lack of knowledge leads to your totally incompetent to talk something you really don’t understand.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;"> </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">So it’s totally unsurprised you don’t understand what I have quoted from OTO’s website: “<span style="color: #3366ff;">the DART projectiles have correctly entered and followed the guidance beam <strong>manoeuvring</strong> with the required and expected</span> <strong><span style="color: red;">accuracy beyond a range of 5 Km.” </span></strong></span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><strong><span style="color: red;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;"> </span></span></strong></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><strong><span style="font-weight: normal; "><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">Why it’s so difficult to achieve a Dart round to just entering the guidance beam in just 5+kms distance? Because the Dart round has already lost most of its speed during supersonic flight ( from m3 inital speed to sub-sonic), and when it's in sub-sonic, the sharp drop in air drag still allows it fly much longer, that’s why it still can achieve a 38kms range, but the sharp drop in speed doesn’t allow the round to have enough kinematic to perform <strong>manoeuvring</strong> that required to keep the round in the beam. </span></span></strong></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><strong><span style="color: red;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;"> </span></span></strong></p>
