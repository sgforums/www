              <p>But it is wrong to say that the 76mm has no eye and poor brain. It is also wrong to say that the 76mm is simply incapable of doing its primary AA role. And where the 76mm lacks in rpm, it more than makes up in the type of munition used. And for a gun that trains at 60 degree per second, why can't it engage more than 1 missile at any one time?</p>

              <p><br>hey relax relax....</p>
              <p>yes the Sea-ram is a good CIWS. it was designed for that particular role as a CIWS and thus it will do it's job as a CIWS. No one can disagree with you on that and that including 16/f/lonely.</p>
              <p>however i cant disagree with 16/f/lonely about the 76mm A gun that is linked to the EO and FCR. with it's rate of fire (120rpm) and it's proximity fused munition, i cant see why it cant be use as a defence against anti ship missiles. yes it wont perform as well as those dedicated system (goalkeeper, Sea-ram etc) but it is still relevant.</p>

              <p><br>haha, i will actually propose the metal storm system for our frigate. one that can deliver a wall of munitions at a very high rate of fire. the range of munitions available for the metal storm can be so wide to include rounds for hard kill as well as chaff and flare for decoy purposes. the high rate of fire will also be useful against a saturated missile or even rocket attack.</p>

              <p><br>The concept of anti-air craft guns are - their rounds are set to explore sending a wall of lead into the path of the incoming missile &amp; planes - at the speed of the framents &amp; missile or plane - any impact with any fragments will result in the missile or plane go totally out of control or even destory. <br><br>It is the same concept of CIWS - which machine gun throw out a wall of bullets , while the 76mm - just shoot bigger rounds that fragment into a wall of lead. Will the 76mm longer range - think the missile will hitting the wall of lead before even the terminal stage. <br><br>Yes the sea-ram sound great - missile hit missile . But so far from most of the modern wars - the anti-aircraft guns seem to have perform better in bring down planes than missile system. Think the navy and others which choice to relies on 76mm - have their reasons .</p>

              it.<br> <br> If people can shoot clay pigeon .... the brain is in the shooter -
              not the round , and it is very effective !!!</p>

              <p>AHEAD is a development primarily for small calibre AA guns with relatively low ROF.  The programmable fuzing allows them to deliver ABM which effectively mimics the "wall of lead" much higher ROF multi-barrel CIWS guns currently put up.</p>

              <p><br>yap the current munition that they are playing with are rather short ranged. i believe the calibre of munition used now is just a prove of concept and with the same technology, i am optimistic that large calibre of munitions can be use.</p>
              <p>the metal storm technology being electrically fired allows the munition to be stack up. in the stack up mode, layers of munition can be laid to be fired up one after another at a very fast rate.</p>

              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial;">First up, this thread is about
                  "Does Formidable need CIWS".<span>  </span>For this, there are 2 rather simple answers -</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"> </p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial;">a) Yes, it needs one.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial;">b) No, it does not need one. </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial;">It is not about what CIWS is the best.   </span><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial;">Did I or anyone in this thread
                  mention that CIGS is superior to Close in Missile Systems (CIMS) like
                  SEA-RAM?<span>  </span>Since you cannot be bothered to read
                  other people's post, I'll summarise my postings in this thread for you.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"> </p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial;">i) Traditional small calibre CIWS,
                  like Phalanx, are fast becoming ineffective against modern AShM threats.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial;">ii) The current trend for
                  inner-layer final protection against missiles is starting to tend towards
                  medium calibre CIGS or Missile systems (which I will hereafter call Close in
                  Missile Systems or CIMS) ;)</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial;">iii) The Oto Melera 76SR mounted by
                  the Formidables is actually a very effective CIGS.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial;">iv) As such, the Formidable does not
                  need to mount a CIWS as it already has one in the form of the 76SR CIGS.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial;">If you wish to start your own
                  argument that a CIMS is the best solution than kindly start your own thread.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"> </p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial;">If you wish to question whether the
                  Oto Melara 76/62 is an effective CIGS, as advertised, than I'll be more than
                  happy to discuss this further since it will relate directly to the question of
                  "Does Formidable need CIWS". </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial;">So now to a point by point answer to

              credible and this is where my respect for the credibility of your opinion takes
              another nose dive.<span>  </span>How much do you
              actually understand of CLOS guidance of Surface-to-Air Missiles (SAM)?<span>  </span>Do you have any idea what you are talking
              about when you spew such nice technical terms as "3-point guidance"?</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial;"> Your post seems to imply that the
              Target, The tracker and the Missile must all fall in a straight line ... if the
              missile deviates from this straight line, it loses the beam and becomes an
              unguided dart.<span>  </span>If that is what you are
              saying, you couldn't be further from the truth.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial;"> CLOS of missiles relies on a
              "3-beam guidance" principle.<span>  </span>The 3 beam implies a Wide Beam, a Medium beam and a Narrow beam.<span>  </span>The wide beam, as the name implies, is a broad
              beam that is meant to cover a large cone and allow the missile to remain in
              guidance when the beam moves violently - such as when tracking a high-g/speed target.<span>  </span>As the missile flies along the Wide beam, it attempts to navigate
              progressively towards the more focused, and accurate, narrow beam - which is focused on the target itself.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial;">This basic "3-beam guidance"
              principle is why CLOS SAMs do work.<span>  </span>It
              is rather disingenious of you to only quote ATGMs and try to delude people into
              thinking that beam riders do not work against fast moving targets.<span>  </span>You seem to be either ignorant of or have
              deliberately "forgotten" about a whole family of CLOS SAMs from the
              RBS70 to the most recent StarStreak.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal">Nice try but please stop the BS-ing.</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial;">The issue with CLOS SAMs is NOT as
              you claim, the inability of the missile to follow the beam.<span>  </span>The actual problem is rather to do with the
              ability of the operator to keep the beam on the target.<span>  </span>Given that the Strales uses a Ka band radar
              to guide the beam, maintaining the beam locked on the missile is not a problem
              for the Strales Dart.</span></p>

              tell you the intercepting missile has to be at least 4-5 times G load than the
              missile it suppose to catch, ESSM or SEA-RAM all have tremendous max G loads
              not at beginning, but most likely somewhere at the terminal stage because those

              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial;">First
              things first, since when is a G-of-maneuver measured solely on speed alone?<span>  </span></span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial;"><span></span>G-m relies on 2 components – speed and angle
              of turn.<span>  Actually t</span></span><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial;">here are other factors
              that affect this, such as aerodynamic, structural, and buffet limits, but let’s
              keep it simple for now.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial;"></span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial;">What I'm trying to get at is that you can pull a 9g at 450knots
              just as you can pull a 9g turn at 750knots … the only difference will be the
              turn radius.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial;"></span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial;">Basic
              physics … don’t believe me? 2 words for you to google … “Centripetal
              Acceleration”.<span>  </span> </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial;">Second
              thing about this statement.<span>  </span>The DART
              round is effectively a Fin Stablised Discarding Sabot (FSDS) round.<span>  </span>Go google up a ballistics calculator and
              figure out how much a 15:1 dart with an ogive nose loses in air speed over 5km
              … only about 6%.<span>  </span>The DART round actually
              has an unguided range of up to 38km against other targets ,,, this gives you an
              indication that the ballistics degradation is not as severe as you imply it to
              be.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial;"> </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial;"><em>“ESSM or SEA-RAM all have tremendous
              max G loads not at beginning, but most likely somewhere at the terminal stage

              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial;"> Let’s not talk about ESSM since that
              a 50km missile and not really in the same systems category as
              76SR/SEA-RAM.<span>  </span>Let’s talk about SEA-RAM.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial;"> </span>You sound like you are under some
              kind of impression that AAMs and SAMs boost continuously up till their max
              range.<span>  </span>If you thought so, you couldn’t
              be further from the truth.<span>  </span>All solid
              propellant Missiles boost for only the first few seconds of their flight
              profile.<span>  </span>The larger the missile, the
              longer it will boost for, but invariably, by mid-phase, almost all of them are
              unpowered missiles.<span>  </span>This is why they all
              have a variable range engagement envelope that is highly dependant on their
              launch altitude, launch speed since these 2 factors impart more energy to
              missile then the booster alone can.</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial;">  SEA-RAM is based on the rocket motor
              and body of the AIM-9 Sidewinder AAM.<span>  </span>The
              SEA-RAM missile is also about 2.8m long.<span>  </span>Do you have any idea what the rocket motor burn time of a ~2.8m AIM-9
              is?<span>  </span>Let me clue you in … 2.2 seconds.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial;">  What this boils down to is that the SEA-RAM,
              at about 2,000m, becomes an unpowered missile, like the Strales DART.<span>  </span>Even worse, it actually has a a lower
              velocity at the 2km mark compared to the Strales DART, which implies it
              actually has a lower energy state compared to the Strales DART.<span>  </span>The SEA-RAM has one saving grace, it has
              bigger control surfaces which gives it a better angle of turn rate than the
              DART.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial;"> At the end
              of the day, both SEA-RAM and DART are really only capable of 1 high-g
              corrective maneuver to intercept the incoming AShM.<span>  </span>Given their energy states, they both are
              unable to come around for a second try.<span>  </span>So even if we assume that a single DART has a pKill of 70%, a volley 3-4
              of them will have a pKill of 95% which is as good as a salvo of 2 SEA-RAM and a
              damn sight cheaper.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial;"> </span></p>
              <blockquote>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial;">Because of this, the Strales Dart so
              far only managed to keep the dart round in line of sight for a maximum 5kms,
              repeatability and real field performance is somewhat questionable. There’s
              still no confirmed customer for that and let alone, if such a system is
              adopted, additional hardware installation will be inevitable.</span></p>
              </blockquote>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial;"></span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial;">I honestly
              have no idea why you think the Strales DART has a range of only 5km.<span>  </span>The actual operational parameter is not open
              domain but I’ve read that the capability extends to as far as 10km.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial;"> Of course
              we have no combat record to prove the effectiveness of the Strales DART, that’s
              because it’s in the operational test phase.<span>  </span>But then again, is there any real field or combat review for the
              SEA-RAM?</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial;"> I don’t
              understand the comment on additional hardware.<span>  </span>Yes, additional equipment will have to be fitted but it is backward
              compatible with the 76SR, which means that the existing user base will be able
              to easily upgrade and increase their effectiveness.<span>  </span>Seriously, as if the SEA-RAM in itself does
              not represent additional equipement … :rolleyes:</span></p>

              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial;">You seem to
              be building your argument around the concept that a AShM will be maneuvering
              violently in the terminal phase.<span>  Since this point is central to your arguements, I'd really appreciate it if you produce some links r\or quotes </span>to back this up.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial;">The reason why I choose to doubt your claims is simple. An
              AShM in it’s terminal phase is very different from a fighter doing evasive
              maneuver.<span>  </span></span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial;"> The fighter
              has no envelope restrictions and is free to maneuver across all axis and end states.<span>  </span>The AShM must conduct all maneuvers with one
              overriding prerogative, it must hit the target.<span>  </span>The closer it gets to the target, the more restricted it’s maneuvers
              must become in order not to miss the target.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial;"> At the
              engagement distances and closing speed that we’re talking about, I seriously
              doubt that the high-g maneuvers you are talking about will result in a
              significant miss distance beyond the capability of the burst radius of the
              SEA-RAM missile or the DART round.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial;"> I will
              appreciate any maths or proof of your claims.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial;"> p/s: do not
              forget that your SEA-RAM is operating under the same end-game energy
              restrictions as the Strales DART.</span></p>

              <p>What the fascination with the G-Numbers? </p>
              <p>Those missiles lose smash when making huge turns. The lesser smash a missile has, the easier it is to intercept...</p>
              <p>As kotay explained, even an AMRAAM will be hard pressed to kill anything if it has to make a high-g turn at terminal phase.  It loses so much energy that it can no longer get into a decent range for proximity sensor to kill.</p>
