Why it is that a room has a 3rd door built when the door does NOT even lead anywhere. For fun issit?  And how come a room in a certain camp was mysteriously sealed up.

            <div class='col-md body'>In today's Singapore. I think covering up anything is a little harder since there would definitely be witnesses or circumstantial evidence. People dun just disappear. So if they want people to shut up, someone must be getting paid. And if u witnessed it and they wanted to hush the thing up, i think u should ask for money or favours.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote>TNP may be a tabaloid but the S'pore press is pretty much controlled &amp; you will not see ANYONE (TNP included) publish such stories unless SAF clears it. Besides, if SAF keeps it to themselves &amp; doesn't even report, how the hell would TNP know about it? </blockquote>Are you that familiar with the newspaper business? Cuz I'm skeptical. FYI The S'pore press isn't "controlled"; it's fiercely pro-establishment. For professional reasons, it doesn't report things without a factual basis &amp; - contrary to your implication - it has touched on supposedly supernatural issues before. Also, since when did it need SAF "clearance" to report such stuff?<br><br><blockquote>And for your info, SPI is merely a group of ppl with similar interests. They are certainly not paranormal experts or "ghostbusters"; as you call them. </blockquote>SPI supposedly stands for Singapore Paranormal Investigators (self-explanatory). Have they closed a case outside of the military realm?<br><br><blockquote>There are MANY things in the world which can't be explained so easily. So don't just discount everything as fake. </blockquote>Won't dignify your other wild speculations, but who said I discounted everything as fake? FYI I do believe in things paranormal, i.e. beyond scientific explanation, cuz something like acupunture &amp; the I-Ching are "paranormal" (but not supernatural). Ditto in things supernatural, i.e. beyond natural/physical laws, cuz something dreams &amp; premonitions are "supernatural" (but not paranormal).<br><br>But I've also conscious in not subscribing to superstition, i.e. an internal irrational belief/fear of the unknown. I certainly don't believe in ghosts, either. My active kakis &amp; I joked about the latter before when we were camped inside a cemetary: if we did see a ghostly apparition ahead of us, would it take the form of a pontinak, demon, ghoul, zombie, et al? Would everybody feel the same fear if it doesn't "belong" to their culture/religion? If there's a frightened cat next to us, what did it see - a monster cat? A dog?</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Come on Moxie!! Grow up &amp; stop being naive!!  If the press ain't controlled, why do all papers need the approval from the Ministry of Info &amp; Arts?  As for SAF clearance, in the first place if SAF does not leak out such news, there's no way the newspaper will know. Secondly, even if the newspaper knows, you think they can just walk into the camp?<br><br>In case you didn't know, you can't just stroll into camp. Esp if you are a reporter. You need permission before you can enter to report about anything. I'm starting to wonder if you even did NS in the first place.<br><br>And it doesn't matter what SPI stands for, the fact is that they are NOT a group of "ghostbusters" as you called them.  And to answer your question, NO they have not closed any cases. Go to their website &amp; you'll see 90% of the cases are open ended.<br><br>And BTW, accupuncture is a traditional Chinese medicine method. It is certainly NOT paranormal. At least get your facts right first!!<br><br>And you've not given your version of what you think happened. Since you think those supernatural stories are all rubbish, let's hear your "rational" view of what really occurred.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Now you're grasping at straws, ecesce.<br><br>Grow up? I'm 38, bro - even finished my reservist cycle already.<br><br>MITA isn't a secret police or a leviathan that controls the daily running of the media. It <span style="font-style: italic;">awards licences</span>, as well as the power to suspend, cancel or shorten the licence period there's alleged infringement of media-related legislation (the relevant Statute Acts - see under Newspapers here: http://statutes.agc.gov.sg/subindex/N.htm ) The latter is why the more-liberal journalists are sometimes fighting against, not some omnipresent control. Don't mix them up.<br><br>Why keep bringing up camp access for reporters? There's plenty of local training grounds (outside of SAFTI Live Firing Area) where ghostly encounters supposedly took place. Nothing to stop the press from lurking around for stories.<br><br>Re: "traditional Chinese medicine method is certainly NOT paranormal". Not true, if you look under the word defination. Simple question: Has TCM been scientifically proven yet? Don't watch them ang-mo "paranormal" TV shows too much, at the risk of provincialising your mindset further.<br><br>No need to provide to provide "a rational view of what really occurred." In case you didn't get it last time around, I already pointed out that you're subscribing to superstition with the, whatisit, Third Door &amp; stuff. Whether they exist or not is one thing, but that's separate from the irrational belief in them (which is superstition).<br><br>You want me to accept the unknown from such blind faith? Please, lah.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Moxie, in case you didn't know, age does not equate to maturity.  I know a 13 year old girl who's more mature in her thinking than a 40 year old aunt of mine!!  Go figure.<br><br>Yes, MITA is not a secret police but if there is no censorship at all, why would every paper need their approval?  In fact, the govt had previously explained why it was necessary to have some degree of control &amp; censorship.  In otherwords, they did not deny that there was control &amp; censorship.  So why are you arguing other wise &amp; claiming that the papers here are not subjected to control by the govt?<br><br>I keep bringing up camp access for reporters simply 'cos there are MANY incidents that occur inside camps. And even the training grounds are by right out of bounds to non SAF personnel, so by right reporters aren't suppose to lurk there too.<br><br>TCM has a very long history dating back to even before the ang mohs invented their cures.  Now even the ang mohs are starting to admit that TCM is not all hype &amp; it does work.  Give it some time &amp; TCM I am sure WILL be scientifically proven.  Right now the white man rules the world.  If the Chinese ruled the world, I'm sure no one would be doubting whether TCM is for real or not.<br><br>A rationale view would help since you claim those events are all untrue.  There's a difference between superstition &amp; supernatural encounters.  The 3rd door was not built for 'good luck' or wat have you.  And like I said, why would they bother to call contractors in to cement &amp; brick up the doors &amp; windows of a room?  If they don't need to use the room any more, just close the door. WHY go thru the trouble to seal it up like that? Superstition? Explain how superstition had anything to do with that.<br><br>Since you're such a big fan of SPI, I'm sure you've been to their website. And I'm sure you've read the "investigation" they did about the 3rd door &amp; the sealed room which I talk about.  So to answer your question, those things are true. A 3rd door WAS built and the room WAS sealed.  Now the question once again, is WHY??  For fun?  I think not.<br><br>Blind faith as you call it, is simply shoving aside everything that we can't explain &amp; pretending it doesn't exist. In other words, just buat bodoh about it since we can't understand or explain it.<br><br>Its just like trying to convince some ppl that God exists. You will surely encounter ppl who feel that there's no such thing as God. We are not talking about whether Freddy Krueger or Jason exists.  Those are monsters from movies.  We are talking about spirits.<br><br>But there's clearly no point in me wasting my breath. You are clearly someone who does not believe in spirits.  Might you happen to be a free thinker I wonder??</div>
