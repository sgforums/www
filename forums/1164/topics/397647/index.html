              <p>LONDON (AFP) - – Aliens may exist but mankind should avoid contact with them as the consequences could be devastating, British scientist Stephen Hawking has warned.</p>
              <p>"If aliens visit us, the outcome would be much as when Columbus landed in America, which didn't turn out well for the Native Americans," said the astrophysicist in a new television series, according to British media reports.</p>
              <p>The programmes depict an imagined universe featuring alien life forms in huge spaceships on the hunt for resources after draining their own planet dry.</p>
              <p>"<strong>Such advanced aliens would perhaps become nomads, looking to conquer and colonise whatever planets they can reach," warned Hawking</strong>.</p>
              <p>The doomsday scenario is suggested in the series "Into the Universe with Stephen Hawking" on the Discovery Channel, which began airing in the United States on Sunday.</p>
              <p>On the probability of alien life existing, he says: "To my mathematical brain, the numbers alone make thinking about aliens perfectly rational.</p>
              <p>"The real challenge is to work out what aliens might actually be like."</p>
              <p>Glowing squid-like creatures, herds of herbivores that can hang onto a cliff face and bright yellow predators that kill their prey with stinging tails are among the creatures that stalk the scientist's fantastical cosmos.</p>
              <p>Mankind has already made a number of attempts to contact extraterrestrial civilisations.</p>
              <p>In 2008, American space agency NASA beamed the Beatles song "Across the Universe" into deep space to send a message of peace to any alien that happens to be in the region of Polaris -- also known as the North Star -- in 2439.</p>

              <p>In recent years....astrobiology, astronomers and astrophysic has learned the followings:</p>
              <p>1) Realized that other planetary systems probably are not uncommon. making it seem much reasonable that other stars could have Earth like planets.</p>
              <p>2) learned that at least a few worlds have conditions that might allow for life of some kind.</p>
              <p>3) astronomers began to get a real handle of the size and age of universe that allow life to arise and evolve.</p>
              <p>4) formation of stars made up of clouds of interstellar gas and that planets should be common around other stars.. credit to Hubble.</p>

              <p>yes.....hawkins is right.....most normal living things live n let live.for a civilisation from another galaxy to come over to earth...they must have concentrated every technology advancement to the point of insanity and with great disregard for living things.</p>
              <p>say if they had a people from ancient times in a faraway galaxy who wanted badly to be the master of other living civilisations where they get technolgy by forcing every alien in their planet to cough out stuff from force shields , space warp travel,death ray canons etc ...i would say that alien beings principle were to force each alien citizen of country to cough out techno wonders which would be classed as secret weapons..all those who were not good at coughing out techno wonders were put to death to prevent using that alien planets resources....so if they had 90 million aliens,,,,each would have coughed up 90 million techno wonders in less than a generation of alien........from that time onwards they would get more and more powerful to the point that country  with that principle becomes world leader and starts putting their flag on the planet itself.</p>
              <p>with so much technology forced out from every mind,,,,,they would be considered as hardwerking and even so when the technolgy forced out were to be connected and making the initiation even way bigger than what it was conceived generations ago.it would merely take less than 300 years for them even to master light speed travel in that 300 years earth time if they were to have a system of "evil" technolgy progress think tank which actually drove them forward instead of stagnation(which is what planet earth is as compared to them)</p>
              <p>when these alien beings reach earth,..they will expect earthlings to cough out techno wonders to facilitate their survival and thoe that cant,,,,would be humanely be put down like  a sick person.</p>

              <p>I can think of 2 reasons why extraterrestrial would want to colonize planet earth.</p>
              <p>1) already mention their home planet is dying and they need a new home.</p>
              <p>2) We are part of their proteins diet or energy. (war of the world / matrix)  </p>
              <p>i think if planet Earth is the intended colonize planet than I would think that what ever extraterrestrial is probably near to carbon base and able to adapt to Oxgen or at least contain high amount of O2 and able to swim in Water. Given that planet is 70% cover by ocean.</p>
              <p>I do not think they would use projectile type of weapon. They need intergalactic transport to move the ammunition or energy to fire the weapon. That would not be the most efficient way to take over the planet of 6 billions humans.</p>
              <p>They would not want to destroy the eco system of planet earth if they choose to migrate.</p>
              <p>they might stage themselve on nearby Planet such as Mars where they have an easier time adapting with ice as the source for liquid and launch their attack from there.</p>
              <p>They might customized an effective virus that link our DNA eliminate us in a effective manner. Or they might engage  a power on this planet to fight a proxy war for them of total domination while half of the planet is given to them.  </p>

              <p>really.....ambitious space alien would hand down technology stuff to the nesxt generation to build n design in order to go places where no one is able and to do stuff that no one dares....</p>
              <p>just like the jcurrent japanese emperors who hand down the throne,gardens ,wealth to his sons and future emperors....or the king of england handing down power n wealth accumulated over the centuries down to the queen of england.</p>
              <p>the civilisations that hand stuff down technologically and built them over n over is bound to rank supreme than the unstable chinese dynasties or disorganised indian maharajah or even greece itself even though they might be advanced in thoughts.</p>
              <p>right now in some distant galaxy....there might be aliens who use brute inhuman thoughts to progress technologically and enslave other  manpower to build their "star destroyers".....all these are not new as humans they themselves have been doing this for centuries all the way in 1000AD.</p>
              <p>not surprised as aliens could be more organised and dedicated in technology to the point that they enslaved other aliens  to build starships. or even entire planets turned into starship factories in order they go forward to other galxies for more resources and plunder.</p>
              <p>as in all living things............how does a guy get a tv???either he has to werk for it honestly or steal it dishonestly or build his own thru sheer hardwerk which he was taught from young by his father and grandfather.</p>
              <p>aliens either trade and werk to get it peacefully or they come and plunder tv shop!!</p>
              <p>for those aliens who were taught how to build a tv....they wont come to earth or other planets as they are way too intelligent to be captured n enslaved.</p>
