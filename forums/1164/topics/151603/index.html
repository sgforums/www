            <div class='col-md body'>Natural disaster is like war----it come when you are not prepared well and not expecting it.<br>What lessons can we learn Katrina?<br><br>No.1 -----<strong><a href="http://www.nola.com/hurricane/index.ssf?/washingaway/thebigone_1.html" rel="nofollow">Listen to expertsÂ’ warning</a></strong><br><blockquote>"A catastrophic hurricane represents 10 or 15 atomic bombs in terms of the energy it releases," said Joseph Suhayda, a Louisiana State University engineer who is studying ways to limit hurricane damage in the New Orleans area. "Think about it. New York lost two big buildings. Multiply that by 10 or 20 or 30 in the area impacted and the people lost, and we know what could happen."<br>"The worst case is a hurricane moving in from due south of the city," said Suhayda, who has developed a computer simulation of the flooding from such a storm. On that track, winds on the outer edges of a huge storm system would be pushing water in Breton Sound and west of the Chandeleur Islands into the St. Bernard marshes and then Lake Pontchartrain for two days before landfall.<br>"Water is literally pumped into Lake Pontchartrain," Suhayda said. "It will try to flow through any gaps, and that means the Inner Harbor Navigation Canal (which is connected to Breton Sound by the Mississippi River-Gulf Outlet) and the Chef Menteur and the Rigolets passes. </blockquote>2.<strong><a href="http://www.brendanloy.com/page2.html#112508439674865742" rel="nofollow">Listen to advices of an amateur weather enthusiast </a></strong><br>(This guy is interviewed by Fox TV)<br><br><blockquote>Evacuate<br>8/26/2005 11:22:00 PM EST (FRIDAY)<br>Posted by Brendan Loy<br><br>I'm not a meteorologist. I'm just an amateur weather enthusiast, a law-student blogger who happens to be a hurricane buff. But if I lived in New Orleans, I would definitely leave at this point. Tonight. Barring a major change in the forecast, I expect the evacuation orders to come tomorrow. That will produce massive traffic jams and general confusion. My advice? Beat the rush; get out now. For it is imperative to get out. Katrina probably won't destroy New Orleans -- but it could. So if anyone in New Orleans is reading this, I'd personally advise you to get the hell out of dodge.<br></blockquote>3.<strong><a href="http://www.mvn.usace.army.mil/pao/response/HURPROJ.asp?prj=lkpon1" rel="nofollow">Listen to US Army Crop of  Engineers' pleadings</a></strong><br><blockquote>FY 2005 BUDGET/EFFORT.

            <div class='col-md body'>The US command and control structure for responding to the hurricane is too decentralised. Our dear Mr Bush is too focus on his world peace effort, while his snetors are busy quarrelling over budget deflict. Worst of all, the army and the home guards are too busy over other projects.<br><br>There seems to be no cross functional team or cross ministrial team formed to co-ordinate this resuce and resettlement effort. In addition, there are delays and confusions in delivering the aids to the victims. Instead, it looks like the entire saga has fast becoming a finger pointing game.<br><br>There is also lack of a proper guideline to come out with a action plan and roadmap to help the city from recovering. The American public has been very willing to lend a helping hands to their fellow countrymen, but the officials seems to be too preoccupied with other tasks.</div>
