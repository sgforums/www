            <div class='col-md body'>Unfortunately the horrors of the holocaust caused the world to create several precedents that are, at best, very hard to adhere to. As previous posters have stated, the role of the individual soldier is to obey orders, and in grey situations, that is what the soldier has to do.<br><br>The Milgram experiments show that the majority of people put under orders will follow those orders, up to and including torturing and killing other human beings. This is simply human nature. The onus, then, is on the commander to ensure that no immoral orders are given. In the absence of moral command the soldier should not be held responsible because he cannot be expected to do much about it.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by korusu:</div><div class="quote_body">You see, this explanation sounds great when we are having an academic discussion, but now this would mean giving the individual soldier the power of decision in a combat situation. Imagine that you are the sergeant and the car is approaching your checkpoint without slowing down (you suspect explosives), and your man refuses to open fire because he believes it to be an illegal order. Does that count as showing cowardice in the face of fire?<br><br>I feel that the judgment of nuremberg trials gave problem to the individual soldier. You mean I have the right to question my commanders in a firefight? I would either be shot in the field or hung at some trial after the war.<br><br>Yeah, better hope that you are on the winning side<br><br></div></blockquote> Agree with you that international rules and laws like geneva convention are for academic discussion. It would be your conscience that decide if you would sleep well after the war, not who gave the order or whether you would be tried for the action you took or did not take.<br><br>If you were given the order to shoot and you had all the chance in the world to stop the vehicle, but you turned around and argue with your commander instead, the vehicle went past your sentry, drove 50 meter inside and exploded, hundreds of people whom you know were killed or wounded, how would you feel? your commander was killed so nobody would be there to prosecute you for not taking order.<br><br>On the other hand, you took the order and fired just one short at the vehicle, its petro tank exploded and the people inside burn to death. The people later confirmed to be some new contractors coming to work inside the camp. How would you feel? I believe blaming the commander would not erase the screaming of the people burnt to death right in front of you.<br><br>The lower the ranking, the fewer information the soldiers have to decide what is a legal or illegal order. Commanders, with more information, better training, are expected to give orders for good reasons, and soldiers are expected to just comply without questioning. But it would be our conscience to question what are orders for good reasons. Orders to kill enemies unarmed with their hands up, women, children, babies, old folks are never for good reasons, by any standard of any civilization.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_evil.gif" alt="Evil or Very Mad" title="Evil or Very Mad">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_evil.gif" alt="Evil or Very Mad" title="Evil or Very Mad">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_evil.gif" alt="Evil or Very Mad" title="Evil or Very Mad"><br><br>What are illegal orders? I believe our constitution calls on the SAF to protect the lives and properties of Singapore, besides the sovereignty of the Republic. What if you were given order to fire at some protestors taking part in a demonstration against the government, like what happened in Thailand, would you fire? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_twisted.gif" alt="Twisted Evil" title="Twisted Evil"> What if the government mobilize the SAF to fight for Taiwan, alongside the US, when war broke out across the straits? would you report to the mobilization? Are these kinds of orders legal, in view of the nature of war and the role of the SAF specified in our constitutions? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_twisted.gif" alt="Twisted Evil" title="Twisted Evil">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_question.gif" alt="Question" title="Question"></div>
