              Would you buy a machine that only a handful of others own and
              operate? The new generation warplanes have not proven their
              performance nor sustainability. Many countries operate F-15s and it

              trade expertise, etc.</p>

              <p>To add on, when I was in poly, a lecturer who was from the air force previously told us that just get two F-16 engines, prop them into an F-15, and the F-15 can fly.</p>
              <p>Also, another lecturer said that many of SG's planes (like the F-16) were from the US, and thus the units of measurement in maintenance manuals and the like are all in imperial units (such as inches). It'll be the same for the F-15, thus avoiding the kind of confusion or errors that would otherwise be had if our Air Force techs need to work on a plane from, say, Europe, which would use SI units such as millimetres.</p>

              <p>None of us here can tell you that range.  I doubt no one can give you an absolute number especially when it comes to detection ranges. </p>
              <p>Detection range varies according to the ability of the radar, output, target aspect, radar cross section just to name a few.  </p>
              <p>As I mentioned earlier, its not about being totally invisible, but rather decreasing the range which the offending radar can detect and effectively employ weapons against it.  This allows the Silent Eagle with a more advanced radar to achieve a better launch window to employ its own weapons while staying out of the enemy's reach.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>As for the F-15 w/ 2xF-16 engines, thats largely correct.   The current F-15SG models is using engines that are also used in the Block 50 models of F-16s in the USAF. </p>
              <p>I think your lecturer is in a better position to comment on these stuff than most of us can! =D</p>

              <p>Irrelevant to know what range. The RWR should be sensitive enough to detect when the aircraft has been detected at whichever range it should be. The point is whether there are sufficient counter-measures to handle a detection and the F-15SG certainly has sufficient ECM and ACM capability for that purpose.</p>
              <p>It is easy for an aggressor to under-estimate an old frame  and that's been the SAF approach with the F-15, subs, MBT and other future acquisitions.</p>
              <p>The F-15SG is a capable aircraft that exceeds the capabilities of all other aircraft in the region in the dimensions in which the SAF will conduct a war in.</p>
              <p>Those dimensions includes range, power, detection, avionics, protection, pilot training, serviceability, munitions and delivery rates. And importantly, surprise surprise, its getting better with new capabilities being added on.</p>
              <p>That's not to say the competing aircraft aren't capable. But in the context of what SG requires, just not as capable. Even the F-35 cannot compete on certain roles that the F-15SG excels in and that's why LM has focussed some effort in debunking the F-15SE effort.</p>

              <p>The early APG-70 of the F-15s already had LPI mode so its not really a new concept. The difference is that later AESAs allow continuous tracking without triggering the RWRs. From my limited understanding, this is achieved through low power, freq hop, etc. So there is no issue at least at this time of having secondary guidance + terminal guidance is "fire and forget" for the AIM-120.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>IR missiles don't need tracking but sensitivity is an issue for long-ranged IR missiles.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Suk radars light up like christmas trees and they aren't aesa which suggests same problem with phased arrays.</p>

              <p> </p>
              <p>F-35 isn't so much as trade off for stealth as designed for stealth. Even the -B version has more range without tanks compared to the F-16 with tanks, carries as much munitions internally as the F-16 with tanks, whilst still enjoying stealth with greater performance from higher thrust engines with higher TW rating, better avionics, internalised systems and capability for upgrade. </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>If the F-16 could fulfil the role today, its steps up with the F-35 (any version).</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Its easy to say the F-35 could carry more, be faster etc. The limitation is always the engine ability and 2 would be required for better performance. That would be the F-22 with correspondingly greater cost.</p>

              <p>Actually, its just the F-22's capability.  Its LPI's detection range is significantly shorter in order to avoid detection.  I can't really specify how it does that ( I'm not qualified to authoritatively say it ), but it allows the F-22 to use its stealth capability to get in close to take a very high PK shot before the target figures out its been targeted.</p>
              <p>True, the AIM-120D can allow a 3rd party to provide mid course update, but that would also mean that the 3rd party must be able to track the target as well.  So the pivotal point is the radar.  Somebody's radar must be able to figure out where the target is in order to relay the information right?  Hence that radar must be fairly resilient to jamming and able to detect stealthy fighter sized targets.</p>

              <p>Why would the aircraft need to switch on its radar at the last minute when the missile can rely on relayed data from the 3rd platform for mid-course update?  I think it just has to stay connected to the datalink and designate that contact as the platform to be tracked.  </p>
              <p>I think everything sort of relies on the new datalinks for greater bandwidth to handle more data... hmmm...</p>
