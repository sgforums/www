            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote>Originally posted by Lonewolf<br>Like I said I have no hard evidence about the merkava's but I'm hearing from the tankees about the simulator training they had and how hush hush it is, Spore is famous for keeping things hush hush eg our Special Operations force ( spore SEAL equvelant ) has been around since the late 70's but was only public knowledge in 2000. not to mention the Centurions ( they use to transport them in the middle of the night) or even the <strong>phantoms fighter bombers based in ROC was all hush hush, oops i think the phantoms still is.</strong><br><br>As for the terrain in Malaysia ( intended place of ops for saf armoured Battle groups) It will either be very dusty with soft soil ( dry season ) or very soft and muddy ( wet season ) or metal roads ( rural ), aka something like rural palistine only theirs is much more dry and dusty. We hardly ever train for urban warfare which will be the case if we were intended to fight in Spore.<br><br>SAF main armoured doctrine is tanks with heavy infantry support in assault or the AI ( armoured infantry ) flanking while the big guns keep the bad boys occupied, which the merkava is ideal for with its space for troops ( isrealy/ panzergranadier style ) , hence we do not even have reactive armour due to the proximity of our troops to the tanks.<br><br>as for Price $$, We are ( fact not boasting) only asean country with apache's, stealth cruisers, largest army, navy, airforce, SGD is also the strongest currensie. so spending $$ for Merkava's is not that far fetch.</blockquote><a href="http://www.defencetalk.com/forums/showthread.php?t=5604&amp;page=4" rel="nofollow">http://www.defencetalk.com/forums/showthread.php?t=5604&amp;page=4</a><br><br>The above is being posted by a Singaporean in Defence Talk.com<br>He mentioned about the F4s kept in ROC.

They were not allowed to sell weapons and systems "currently" being used by the US Forces.  So initially it was a no-sell.  The compromise came when the USAF figured they needed to reduce the cost of the F-16, and managed to do some arm pulling to allow the F-16 to be sold at a "reduced" capability.  That is, using the F-4's J79 engines.<br><br>A change in the administration saw a lift of that restriction, and a full capability F-16A was allowed to be sold to friendly countries.   That blew out whatever hope any competitor had of selling their aircraft to forum buyers.  (Namely, the F-20, to be sold as the F-5G)</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>If I remember correctly,  RSAF was evaluating 2nd hand F-4 Phantom F-4S (ex USN variant) in the early 80s instead of the F-4E used by the USAF. I think brand new F-4E would still be quite expensive and there were plenty of ex-USN F-4 on sales. The F-4 production would have ceased or stopping.<br><br>It wouldn't have made sense to purchase F-4 anyway in the 80s. Big plane that required an WSO wasn't quite what RSAF was prepared for. F-5 was still the mainstay of the force.<br><br>F-16 proved to be the right decision. I'm not sure if I can say about F-15SG. Only time will tell. I would have loved to see Rafale in RSAF colours. If not the Rafale, then perhaps even Typhoon or F-18E/F.</div>
