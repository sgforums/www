            <div class='col-md body'>Oh about the RSAF F/A-18C/Ds.  It never happened.  RSAF evaluated the hornets as well, and damn well nearly bought it I THINK.  However, that never went through.  The notification was there, but the deal didn't.<br><br>If you read fas.orgs FMS section it says:<br><br><blockquote>Congressional notification does not necessarily mean the weapons were actually exported as described. Limited changes may occur without another notification, or the final contract or letter of offer may never have been completed.</blockquote>I'm guessing we changed our orders quite a number of times, and not everything we bought was reflected.  And as for the orders such as the F/A-18s, it was reflected but never bought.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Well, we requested for F4 before we acquired the carcasses of A4B from arizona when Philippines was having the Crusaders. That time US congress did not allow F4 to be sold to 3rd country while PI was a special ally. Just like the waterdown version of F16AB which later sold to us. In fact, at one time we were very interested in the swedish Viggens..<br><br>Before SF260 we were having Air Tourer from NZ as our basic trainers..<br>All the time before Mt Pinatubo eruption, most of the aircraft were stationed in Clark air base on rotational basis</div>

Thus cost of spares will be higher. At that time, Singapore is not that rich yet.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"></div>
