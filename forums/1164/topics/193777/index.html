            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote>well ... i guess we have to get rid of our modern mindset when we think about such things .... modern armies require a lot more stuff to get going, food, ammo, water, fuel, and odds and ends like toilet paper to paper and batteries .... and yet hitler managed to throw about 3 million men at Stalin during the start of his Russian campaign eh ? ....<br><br>ancient armies don't require that much .... arrows and spare weapons perhaps, fodder for horses and fresh horses, food for men, which were pretty spartan affairs during those times, and that's about it eh .... so what's so unbelievable about it ? ... </blockquote>Well i have rid myself of modern mind sets.<br>For example,the Romans who were purely infantry with a sprinkling of horses and packed animals.<br>The animals carried it's own food plus tentage and other camp gear.The soldiers carried their armour,shield,his cooking gear,a spike for fortification,weapons and his rations. Which were made of barley and hard tack oat meal thingy.<br>All in all he had about 30 kg worth of gear. Food was provided locally through supply dumps which had to be set up the year before. And was usually gathered frm all over the empire.<br><br>The animals seldom grazed. and they never lived off the land unless they really had no choice. And even then they seldom had more then 50,000 soldiers in a place. Mainly they moved seprate and attacked together. usually 2 or 3 leigons together.(around 6,000men with 4000 axluia each)<br><br>So there we have it. How did the Chinese do it?? They had food and water for all those men. The land cannot support that if there is a million men.(talking abt region here not the whole empire)<br>Arrows had to be fashioned and honestly because of the rate of fire they used them pretty damn fast.However i have heard that the Chinese do have grain supply dumps.Though i wonder about the water situation.<br><br>And Hitler threw 3million men acrossing the entire front. That's thousands of miles.And that's with trains and perservertives hahah.<br><br><blockquote> dont think there is a need to carry too much of food and fodder. Firstly the ration of horses can be found practically everywhere in China. Supply can be supplemented from hunting in the forest. And usually supplies come along with reinforcement to prevent them from being attack.</blockquote>Reinforcements are likely to consume quater of what they protected.<br><br>I'm assuming these battles most likely involved a max of 100,000 a side.Though i'm not well versed in Chinese history,could some one explain how they supplied their soldiers? Like chinese sources and stuff.</div>

It didn't end the war, although it might have had a huge effect if the German offensive had worked.</div></blockquote>I won't call it decisive. The German offensive was stalled, in part due to the 101st Airborne's amazing ability to hold on to Bastogne even when they were trapped and surrounded. (Who can forget McAuliffe's rebuff to German calls to surrender: 'NUTS!'  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"> )<br><br>Even if the offensive had worked and the Germans managed to fight all the way to Antwerp, chances are that the Allies could have still choked off the pencil-like thrust and won.<br><br>By the way, that was how the Allies failed in Operation Market Garden. Their supply lines were overextended, and the Germans attacked the flanks of the pencil-like thrust. It's not too hard to imagine that the poorer-equipped Germans would have fared even worse.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>The key to the German loss at Bastogne was their failure to capture all of the corssroads.  Had they done so, they would have cut Allied supply lines and prevented reinforcements.</div>
