            <div class='col-md body'>Well gentlemen, there we have our answer to Ayukat's post.  What NS teaches us is that a positive attitude is essential in any situation, especially rough ones like NS where you are the unwilling, going into the unknown to do the unneccesary for the ungrateful.  Fail to learn that one lesson and wasting that two and a half years becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy.  Learn that lesson and the experience will serve you well for the rest of your life.  It's a Zen thing. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"></div>

Also, never argue with an idiot - he'll drag you down to his level and beat you with experience.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"></div>
