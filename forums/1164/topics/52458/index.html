            <div class='col-md body'><strong>SAF items in online auction raise eyebrows </strong><br><br>By Ben Nadarajan<br><br>MILITARY items from the Singapore Armed Forces (SAF), including an officer's sword and a bullet, are being put under the hammer at Yahoo's online auction site.<br><br>The sword, which every SAF officer is given when he is commissioned, was offered for sale on Monday by 'diediedive'.<br><br>His asking price is $400; so far, no one has made an official bid for it.<br><br>'Tianeng2002' is asking $58 for the bullet which does not contain gunpowder and cannot be fired.<br><br>He described the item, which is used in weapons training, as 'very rare' and promised 'it will not rust and will last a lifetime'.<br><br>A Ministry of Defence spokesman said the drill round, as soldiers call it, is a 'controlled item which should not have been taken out of camp'.<br><br>Another seller is offering a Good Service Medal - given to full-time NSmen who have put in five years of good service - for $180.<br><br>Eyebrows were raised at the SAF and Defence Ministry when told of the items on sale.<br><br>The Mindef spokesman said: 'The commissioning sword and the medal are items which are presented to individual SAF officers in recognition of their efforts and contributions.<br><br>'So, it's inappropriate for them to be sold for a profit.'<br><br>Mindef said that it will be looking into the matter.<br><br>The Straits Times tried to contact the three people who want to sell the items, but the seller of the bullet did not respond to e-mail messages.<br><br>Ms Bonnie Yong, who is selling the medal, said it belongs to a friend who had migrated recently and had asked her to sell some of his personal items.<br><br>Both have not received any bids for their items.<br><br>The man selling the sword, who calls himself Eric, said he was an officer during national service (NS).<br><br>He said he works part-time in Tuas and that the sword is his brother's, formerly also an NS officer.<br><br>In his advertisement, he said that he needed money.<br><br>'This sword is an extra one because my brother migrated and left his sword lying around in the house,' he added.<br><br>When told that he was speaking to a reporter, he claimed other officers are also selling their swords to collectors.<br><br>'Officers can always buy a new sword from the quarter-master for about $300, so those like me who need the cash will just sell their swords, then buy a new one when they have money,' he justified.<br><br>But barely hours after that, the item was taken off the auction website.<br><br>Retired major Raymond Chin is particularly upset about the sword offer.<br><br>Putting the SAF sword up for auction 'cheapened' it, he said, as 'the sword signifies a certain code and loyalty that the officers have for the nation'.<br><br>'It's irreplaceable and should not be treated so flippantly.'<br><br>[/quote]<br><br>its disturbing people are doing such things... it's good though that so far no one has bought the items.</div>
