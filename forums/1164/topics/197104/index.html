The fight against terrorism is a total effort - we have to have government agencies working closely together on the one hand.

            <div class='col-md body'>while singapore's research has been admirable... however.. i need to point out a tiny yet important fact...<br><br>at lethal dose.. a nerve agent can kill within 3 minute...<br><br>in an enclosed underground MRT station...  the first line of defence would not be your antidote nor your detection device... both of which would arrive too late to do much except for those who suffered from sub-lethal dose.<br><br>if our defence brain up there got any brain... the first line of defence for such an attack on our MRT.. would not be our super kit or super antidote.. which is developed by our labs...<br><br>but by installing massive high power exhaust with HEPA and carbon filters to flush the toxic gas out of the station in an instant like a BSC.<br><br>DSO should also consider the effect of fire sprinkler in MRT stations as a form of suppression of chemical attacks...<br><br>all MRT station exits should have water sprinklers curtain that would limit the spread of the chemical outside the station.<br><br>and in the event that the MRT station is contaminated... the first job is to contain the contamination... zone... which would be to evacuate the occupants to a confined restricted area...<br><br>the above are just a few of my suggestion.</div>

I agree with tripwire's point on it will take too much time considering the time to get there. Drawing of blood samples should be relatively fast because just do a finger prick.
