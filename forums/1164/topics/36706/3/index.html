Military habits do not necessary fit with common sense, they are a very conservative organization and left to their own devices, would still be using muskets.<br><br>Body armour works, period. And it works to a great extent... If it did not, the US and Israeli army would not be having plans to eventually develop equip all its troops with such equipment.

If people dun mind taking along other bulky gear to battle in their packs, BA should not be left out because it's so much more important then most of the items included...<br><br>As a matter of fact, BA is considered not just one of the equipment the US Army's land warrior uses, but a module in itself, meaning that Land Warrior is not complete without body armor, while it would be without a canteen or alice pack.</div>

It can be a real b***h when folding. However, this can be corrected with training. Arty gunners have to camo their 155 guns and 7-tonners too...they do it within a respectable time (can't really say  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"> ) and their nets are HUGE! And that's not even it. An M113 mortar carrier crew can get it done even quicker with lesser crew (again, confidential  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"> ), using the same size of nets as the regular APCs; just look at the mortar platoon in your SAR. So I guess its a matter of getting used to it.</div>
