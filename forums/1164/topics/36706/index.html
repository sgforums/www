            <div class='col-md body'>I've noticed that most people give excuses that wearinf body armor will get you killed because of the lack of mobility is <strong><span style="font-style: italic;">COCKAMINE</span></strong>. Why?<br><br>Because the stats prove it.<br><br>While body armor can be heavy (+5-8 kg weight to protect against 7.62 threats). In pratice as they found in vietnam (at that time still using steel plates rather then kevlar, so much heavier) it actually reduces injury and fatality when checked against non-armoured units by seventy percent! Apparently the trade off in mobility was more then worth it.<br><br>Body armor is designed to protect, and also give you resonable mobility. I dun mind lugging around 5-8 extra kilos if it means that I have a 70 percent higher chance of making it back. Case in point, a large number of Rangers in the Black Hawk down incident were injured and killed not because they could not run and dodge fast enough, but because they left armor plates out of their body armor to make it lighter, rendering it protective only up to pistol ammo and useless against 7.62mm rounds. Seregant Casey Joyce, shot in the back and killed by a 7.62 mm shot that went through his heart because he left his back plate out. The bullet went through him and was ironicly stopped by his front plate after it passed through him. Had he brought along his full suite of armor, he would have survived.<br><br>Modern body armor against rifle grade threats is heavy, but reasonable enough to entail wearing it rather then going out sans-armour with only your BDU and skin to stop bullets.<br><br>Many other injuried were also sustained because the Rangers left out their armor plates.<br><br>So moral of the story? Dun complain your BA is heavy, start training your wimpy body instead to take the weight... [/i]</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Body armour is good only for some situations like in FIBUA where casualty rate is up to 40%, (including minor injuries to KIA), according to certain foreign advisors. I don't see body armour being used in an extended jungle warfare situation, unless the new vests are lighter, and more comfortable. I have tried out a bullet proof vest before - really needs to get used to. Felt like a turtle at first. Perhaps the SAF will issue new vests in future, but to be used in certain situations. I remember my unit using jungle hats most of the time in Brunei, it was a real privilege. We switched to helmets closer to the objectives though.</div>

If the trooper is doing statc defense with local counter-attacks even better.<br><br>But I don't think anyone will be looking forward to a long force march with additional 5-8 kg and then have to have a hard fight at the end of the march<br><br>The SAF should not only look at BA but should also look at ways to reduce weight of other eqpt. I know that they are always actively looking at that direction.<br><br>But the widely touted new SAR21 is not lighter than the current M16S1. I know it is suppose to be damn good (never shot one before), with optical sight, better balance, see-thru magazine, laser aimpoint etc etc.... but with more  capabilities, it is actually heavier.<br><br>And the future infantryman is suppose to have even more types of eqpt, latest-NVGs, GPS, some sort of SA-enhancing Integration Battle Information system.<br><br>All these will give a infantryman additional battle-effectiveness but at the same time will increase his payload and increase his rate of exhaustion.<br><br>Remember not everyone is commando type, if you look at each batch of enlistees, they come in all shape and sizes. No offence to everyone on the above statement, I am Singaporean NSman too.<br><br>We also should make realistic comparision, the average SAF infantryman is not a US Ranger in terms of pure physical brawn. We also cannot compare ourselves with the regular US infranty because we do not train continuously especially the NSmen.<br><br></div>

The 5.7mm cartridge was meant to pierce Kevlar vests, and it did that very well during the tests. I'll need some time to dig up the exact stats, but in any case, I think converting an FN P90 to fire Magnum rounds would not be very practical. First, like you said, the recoil would be a little too strong. Secondly, not only would you have to rebarrel the P90, you'd have to reinforce the chamber, bolt carrier, etc. to deal with the increased pressure of firing a Magnum round. Thirdly, you'd have to develop a caseless Magnum round (not very easy, mind you). Not to mention that the increased bullet weight means less rounds per magazine.<br><br>Also, why would they want to use the P90 on the battlefield? I feel that in an urban environment, a P90 would be an excellent weapon, but in the jungle, or over longer distances a traditional assault rifle would be superior.<br><br>And regarding the Swiss, I think they use the SG series (SG550/551/552). The Belgians probably use the new FN FNC rifle (also 5.56mm).<br><br>Just my two cents.</div>

I suggest you grip the front part and use the ploymer axe-shaped like a blade and swing the entire thing to butt stroke people... But I suppose hand-to-hand combat will get less emphasis in the future, because you dun see the OCIWS getting a serious melee outfit... prehaps you could use your sharpened entrenching tool as a melee weapon... think the marines do it... one hit comfirm disembowel the person one... and you will end up scooping out his guts...</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><strong>yeah....sianzzzz....wondered if the results would be better if the sar21 if used to trained the recuits in bmtc???</strong></blockquote>From what I heard, currently they still want to train recruits on the M-16... becos the SAR-21 is so good and easy to shoot (more like arcade style gun then most traditional firearms) that it promotes bad shooting habits, so BMT wants to start them on the right foot... if not they given M-16 after then trained on SAR-21 sure die one... SAR-21 increases the accuracy of the shooter in some cases by nearly 90 percent. They had given some bobo shooters who cannot hit anything with the M-16 in the range the SAR-21 to try out, given basic instructions, and they were hitting the target enuff to earn marksman. The gun is just too forgiving and idiot-proof. Lose a part? Drop it? No problem, the sights will still be accucrate and you can just replace the missing module (besides it strips down into bigger parts so that they're harder to break or lose) and the gun will work as normal. It's a prime example of modern day weapons engineering, where you can just pull a rifle off the assembly line and go to war with it with minimal adjustment... They all work the same way.<br><br></div>
