Any bigger and close terrain mobility will be a problem. Yes, the trooper compartment is small but no smaller than the Ultra's. Compare the 25 to the 25 and the 40/50 to the 40/50 otherwise confirm one is bigger than the other. And it is much easier to get the section in and out. If you have expericence with both the BX and the Ultra you will know.

            <div class='col-md body'>The concept of open-hatch stems from the early use of the M113s in Vietnam, where I've seen pics of troops riding on top. Why? simple...landmines...any explosion, you could at least stand a chance of flying up in the air like a champagne cork, but still survive, albeit injuries. THe open-hatch position is a compromise between landmines and sniper fire. We need to fight in open-hatch position in our terrain, so as to maintain overwatch and vigilance when in movement or laager. The use of air-con is not practical at all. A.I.s won't really complain about the lack of air-conditioning; its the lack of space they might complain about...again creative thinking goes into this as 21 Alpha mentions. Australian and Canadian forces previously employed the M113 like us too; thye could fit in their section of guys together with their rucks...and both the troops and rucks are huge... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br>I think the thing that SAF should invest in are videocams that could be mounted on the turret. I've seen it mounted on Canadian LAV-IIIs...very useful...the screen is like an LCD monitor, and it gives the A.I.s in the APC the chance to assess the tactical situation before they dismount...These sets dun cost that much, and I think its good value for defence $$$.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"></div>
