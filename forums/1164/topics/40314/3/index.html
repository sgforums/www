            <div class='col-md body'>My pratical concept for the new light tank that should replace the AMX-13 SM1, introducing the SM2 tank:<br><br><img src="http://www.urphoto.com/users/130556/116932/editing/1798768qlqum.jpg"><br><br>Weight maybe 15-20 tons, autoloading 120mm low recoil gun plus  7.62 coax. Commander's weapon could prehaps be CIS .50 cal or Ultra Light 40mm AGL. Armour, like the AGS, is completely modular with the maximum protection should provide resistance to RPGs and AT-4s and stuff like that.<br><br>Crew of 3, powered by the same powerpack that runs our 5-tonner trucks, I suppose. Should give it decent mobility. Thermal sighting systems, maybe a CITV could be added also? The clean and angled lines of the hull should be calculated to manage it's radar signature and some measure taken to affect it's infrared as well. Active defences include turret mounted grenade launchers that can lay down heated smoke (to foil thermal sensors) or WP rounds to deter or flush out infantry.<br><br>This system is the most pratical, high end type of light tank singapore, if they ever get down to it, would develop.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>However if we do have the cash to spend, and want something that'll really give us an edge, I suggest we build something that's as revolutionary as below:<br><br><img src="http://www.urphoto.com/users/130556/116932/editing/1798769yecrx.jpg"><br><br>Two man seated in hull configuration, interchangable roles of gunner and driver, with one commanding. Duplicated controls for both sides. Turret completely automated and crew observe their battlespace through sensors mounted all over the tank, optical, thermal, infrared and so on, displated on a widescreen that compresses a 360 degree arc of composited vision into 160 degrees for those on the sides. This gives them a 360 degrees awareness of the situtation and they are aware of everything, amking sneaking up on the tank impossible.<br><br>They have a main sight, and also probe sensors that extends on a stalk to allow them to see above cover and around corners without exposure. Turret top weapon is remote controled and is slaved to the crew's head movements like that of the AH-64 Apache's 30mm bushmaster chaingun.<br><br>Main weapon is prehaps a 120-140mm ETC cannon, or conventional version, depending on how technology progresses. Sensor Fuzed Munitions (smart bullets) should be able to be fired with this weapon.<br><br>Advanced powerpack should be some kind of turbine for high speed dashes, and a less fuel guzzling one for lower speed use. Hull profile, due to crewless turret, can be made low and squat.<br><br>Armor is entirely modular and should be able to be changed at any time. Should provide protection at higher levels of up to maybe even MBT rounds from the front. Active defences like ECM, smoke, thermal decoys and such, even anti-personnel WP smoke grenade launchers should be present for defence (or can even be used in offence) Linkless polymer elastic tracks that are interwoven with composite materials, making the track flexible but yet extremely tough and mine resistant (the blast causes the flexible track to twist and bend, but not fail and returning back to normal shape after blast) the tracks can also be able to take several holes without losing intergity.<br><br>Tank should also be made to be stealthy, more so then the one mentioned above.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Idea 6:<br>Make a disposable LCU like 'tray' with torpedo type propulsion in the center line. This 'tray' will have hydrofoils designed to break off as it hits the beach.<br>If shape correctly, and with enough power, it can probably reach or even surpass the planning speed of the Advanced AAV.<br>Purpose will be to make all tracked vehicles amphibious. All you need to do is drive up this 'tray' and tank commander can remote control itself up the beach!<br>On reaching the beach, the 'tray' opens up and off comes the tank.</div>
