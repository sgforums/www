Carrier cum arsenal ship. Crewed by 350.</div></blockquote>lol, 350 only?? It'll be more than twice of 3500, yep, thats more than seven thousand-strong crew needed.<br><br>A 1.8 km long ship will be a damn nice target for anything, one shot and kaboom. . ., one hole in the ship, another shot and wham, yet another hole. . . basically the ship will be a frigging metal wreck the moment war starts, u could probably not use in shallow waters cos of size, so why bother with it?<br><br>My idea is having Destroyer sized ships, with a Mk16 24 cell SM-2 launcher, 2 CIWS just in case, 1 76mm gun, 16 cell Harpoon VLS, with 16 cell ASROC and some chaff launchers onboard.  It'll most likely be abt 6000 tons. . .<br><br>Get 12 of these in 2 squadrons, plus abt 12 600 ton patrol vessels like the victory-class  in 2 squadrons and 6 600 ton ships in 1 squadron optimised for anti-sub warfare and any navy for defence purposes doesn't have to worry already. . .<br><br>If its a small country like Singapore, a good choice would be 1,200 ton ship with 16 Harpoon in Mk 141 free standing canisters, 76mm gun, and 2x 16-cell Barak, with 2 Mk 32, Surface vessel torp tube with 6x Mk50 lightweight torps, erm, or can u fit that into 1,200 tonnes? hmmmm. . .oh yah, no helicopter deck, save space. . .<br><br>i like the ticonderoga cruiser's complement of weapons, covers all ground. . .and does it very damn well. . .<br><br>another idea is the trimaran hull design. . .being researhed by the British. . . sounds very promising. . .<br><br>moving away from the navy, i pretty much like the CV90. . . a great idea would be a whole army, espcially for a small country like singapore, to have an entire army all based on the CV90 or similar chassis, as far as tracked vehicles are concerned anyway, for singapore, we could have a whole army based on the bionix chassis, simplify maintenance, upgrading or automotive components , whatever. . ., keep wheeled vehicles like LSV, 3 tonner, AMX-10, artillery, and junk everything else. . . get the Bionix as APC, IFV, Tank destroyer(light tank), mortar carrying vehicle, recovery vehicle, engineering vehicle, erm okay, maybe except engineering vehicle and artillery, i think firing a 165 mm demolition gun on the Bionix chassis will cause more damage to the Bionix than anything else around it, fit a 155mm 52 calibre gun on Bionix and u see the vehicle topple over on its on. . .<br><br>forgot abt this earlier: fit air-con onto Bionix first!<br></div>
