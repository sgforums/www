            <div class='col-md body'>11/14/2005 - SALUA AIR STATION, India (AFPN) -- Looking at the radar, the four F-16 Fighting Falcons were clearly outnumbered as 12 opposition aircraft closed in to fire their weapons.<br><br>An E-3 Sentry airborne warning and control systems aircraft started relaying coordinates, preparing the pilots for their impending battle.<br><br>However, this time something was different. The AWACS crew was not soaring high overhead in their Sentry.<br><br>Instead, they were on the ground using Indian air force radar and tracking systems as part of exercise Cope India 06.<br><br>U.S. controllers have been operating out of the Indian radar facility at Salua Air Station since Nov. 8, as they await the return of their aircraft, which returned to Kadena Air Base, Japan, for maintenance.<br><br>Â“The biggest challenge is getting use to the systems and overcoming the limitations,Â” said Tech. Sgt. Steven Harshman, a lead weapons director from KadenaÂ’s 961st Airborne Air Control Squadron. Â“Fortunately most of us have qualified on some sort of ground control station before.Â”<br><br>As Cope India 06 neared the midpoint, fight scenarios intensified with several aircraft participating. Ratcheting up the tempo put added importance on the command and control operators.<br><br>Â“Of course it can be challenging when you have to switch to a system you are not use to using,Â” said Capt. Michael Thomas, a squadron senior director. Â“However, with help from our Indian air force counterparts, we have been able to seamlessly transition our operations, keeping our pilots informed and in the game.Â”<br><br>For both the U.S. and Indian controllers operating together has provided many learning opportunities.<br><br>Â“There is a lot of educating for both sides,Â” Captain Thomas said. Â“It is always a good opportunity to see how another countryÂ’s command and control operations is carried out.Â”<br><br>Though this exercise pits U.S. and Indian aircraft -- battling daily overhead -- the exercise ultimately is about crafting understandings and constructing a working relationship between the two air forces.<br><br>Â“Having Americans control out of here has been a very diplomatic process,Â” said Lt. Col. Peter Bastien, the squadronÂ’s detachment commander. Â“The Indian Air Force has been very gracious in working with us so we can continue our work, keeping this exercise flowing.Â”<br><br><a href="http://www.af.mil/news/story.asp?storyID=123012899" rel="nofollow">http://www.af.mil/news/story.asp?storyID=123012899</a></div>
