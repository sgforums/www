            <div class='col-md body'>Well that's that settled then ... nice speculation all.<br><br>Just some comments on the speculations put forward (I know this is in hindsight) ...<br><br>(1)  It can't be an ultra-light as the reported aircraft is Grey.  Ultra-lights are usually colourful.<br>(2)  It won't be a civilian craft as these are almost always never Grey.  Dirty White maybe but not Grey.  Grey aircrafts are almost always military.<br>(3)  It won't be a jet as the complaint was of a droning sound ... ie. Props.<br><br>The one anomaly is that Gelang Patah is hardly 500m from the border, more like 5km.  However Kampung Tebing Runtoh is 500m from the border.  Look at the map, faint letters just under Bandar Nusajaya.  A bit of creative reporting perhaps?  Making the incursion seem further inland than it is.<br><br><img src="http://img136.imageshack.us/img136/3244/johoreroadandrivermapsouthwest.jpg"><br><br>Kampung Tebing Runtoh  is also conveniently opposite our training area.  They are most probably being bothered by our UAVs.  Heck, even our own troops get cheesed off by the droning of our UAVs. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>BTW, not trying to offend, but if you see something it's "visually", if you hear it ... "aurally".<br><br></div>

Badawi, unlike Mahartir (spelling?) is a bit more of a peacemaker. So it is entirely possible that some diplomatic exchanges with Singapore were made before that statement was issued.<br><br>If it indeed was an incursion by Singapore, then Badawi did the smart thing by first issuing a statement to prevent further public outcry in MY and then make private protest to the SG government not to make such further probes.<br><br>If droning was reported, then jet fighter can be ruled out. And from their description it didn't sound like a light aircraft either. So it could very well be some overly enthusiatic SAF guy operating a UAV.<br><br>It is easy to speculate that Singapore will want to test UAVs in aerial recce of Johore coast if nothing else to test its "stealth" qualitites. Well, the test has proven that UAVs are easily detectable by civilians if not by radar.<br><br>Is it unusual that Singapore does intelligence gathering? Not at all. In fact, even Australia had protested in the past about Singapore's spying activites. That Malaysia could be a potential adversary - and a very nearby one - just make the spying even more intense.<br><br></div>
