It replaces the older UAV employed for providing real-time airborne reconnaissance and surveillance to SAF ground commanders to survey the battlefield without risking human lives. The older UAV was being used since the late 1980s.<br><br>The aircraft is fitted with a small piston engine. Measuring 5 meters in length, it has a wingspan of 7.6 meters. Similar to the older UAV, the Searcher UAV has a control range of up to 100 km, and being bigger, it can carry enough fuel to fly up to 8 hours. The aircraft is made of fiberglass with composite material to reduce radar and infra-red signatures which make them more difficult to detect.<br><br>The Searcher UAV utilises a Global Positioning System (GPS) for navigation, which enables it to fly accurately based on a pre-determined route. It also has many automated features, and multiple system redundancies for enhanced flight safety and reliability.<br><br>Like the older system, it is operated from a ground control station (GCS). Flight information and real time video images are sent from the UAV to the GCS through radio links. The video image is displayed on a television monitor in real time.<br><br>The Searcher UAV is used to detect details on the ground such as enemy troops and vehicles. The battlefield commander will be able to have more reaction time and take countermeasures against the enemy's operations with the real-time information provided. The Searcher UAV can provide battlefield surveillance even in high risk areas without risking the loss of personnel. It is a cost-effective means as it is only a fraction of the cost of a manned aircraft.<br><br><strong>The UAV Training Simulator </strong><br><br>The UAV Training Simulator is the latest trainer simulator system acquired by the RSAF. It is capable of simulating UAV take-off, flying and landing with realistic environmental settings. This allows for effective training of UAV operators in a controlled environment. It will complement actual UAV training in Singapore where the scope is very limited in view of the constraints of local training airspace. A major advantage offered by the training Simulator is that it enables the RSAF to overcome the problem of limited flying airspace in Singapore for UAV training. Additionally, training in the simulator reduces training costs.</div>

It's not something classified, and Singapore has been using it since 1998", said the analyst who declined to be named.<br><br>As Bernama understands, the operation of the UAV was carried out by 40th Squadron of the RSAF based in Murai Camp, not far from the border with Malaysia (<strong>PS to moderators: is this classified?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_eek.gif" alt="Shocked" title="Shocked"></strong>)<br><br>The presence of the aircraft caused agitation among the residents of Gelang Patah as it create noise to the level that 'fishermen could not catch their fish'.<br><br>The MINDEF website mentions that it uses 'Searcher' UAVs which can operate up to a range of 100km from its base for up to eight hours non-stop.<br><br>The Republic is reported to own at least 40 aircraft of that type.<br><br>Commenting on the issue, the chairman of the Government Supporters' Club Datuk Shahrir Abdul Samad said that neighbouring countries are expected to to inform Malaysia about the operation of military aircraft especially when it is conducted near the border in order to avoid any agitation or panic in the residential areas.<br><br>According to him, such a move to announce the presence and peration of military aircraft does not only help resolve any misunderstandings which might arise but is also in line with good neighbourly practices.<br><br>"Even if the presence of the aircraft is to guard the borders or to deter illegal immigrants, they (the neighbouring country) should release statements and inform Malaysia (about the presence of the aircraft)."<br><br>"When the authorities of this country knows about it, they can explain the situation to the residents to clear up any misunderstandings or agitation among them", he said to Bernama here today.<br><br>Sharir said that what happened at Gelang Patah is the result of the Singapore's failure to inform Malaysia about the presence of the aircraft until it led to the state of agitation among the local residents.<br><br>- Bernama'<br><br>There.... that's the best I could do to translate it.
