However, I will reserve my comments until that is verified."</strong><br><br>Bernama reported yesterday that people from several villages in Gelang Patah were at their wits end over the din caused by an aircraft circling above.<br><br>According to a resident of Kampung Tebing Runtoh, the drone of the aircraft could be heard daily up to late into the night.<br><br>Using a high-powered lens, a Bernama photographer managed to take a picture of what seemed to be a grey-coloured aircraft.<br><br>Najib said Malaysia knew of things like this but "if the aircraft is small, it requires keen observation by individuals or members of the public".<br><br>"We will monitor. We always monitor," he told reporters after delivering a keynote address at a closed-door seminar attended by senior army officers at De Colmar Tropicale Resort, here.<br><br>In his speech, Najib said the army's capability should be enhanced further, particularly its readiness to meet current demands.<br><br>He said the army's development would take into account rapid changes in the surrounding environment and its existing capabilities.<br><br>-- BERNAMA<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>What the hell. Any aircraft flying unidentified in their airspace in future will be assumed as a RSAF plane la? This is illogical loh. Why can't it be an Indonesian plane? Their radar sooo lousy. Maybe it's their own plane and they cannot identified it  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"> . I think that they are trying to make some news.

            <div class='col-md body'>Hmmm......Maybe it is some recreational planes that they mistake for a UAV? The problem with radar is that if the plane fly low enough or it's RCS is veri small, it can avoid detection.

            <div class='col-md body'>Two things of note, the new paper said that it took a picture but they did not display it. Why? i dont know.<br>Maybe they are afraid people might be able to identify it.<br>Number 2, the mindef guy said i suppose it could be a singaporean aircraft. Meaning it could be an aircraft owned or taken off from Singapore it does not mean it is a RSAF asset.</div>

At that height it is flying, it is design to be totally soundless to anyone on the ground and against background, it is too small to see.<br><br>So think what the malaysia folks is complaining will most likely turn out to be what is becoming popular in Malaysia - ultra-light or so power guide parachute stuff .</div>
