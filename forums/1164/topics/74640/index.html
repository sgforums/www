There won't be much harassment there. Once you are in SMI, prepared for PT exercise which involves power PT, animal PT, fast march, your bread and butter recce (all sorts of it). Also included will be navigation and operation exercise. There will also be lots of map work. Depending on your luck, you could even turn operational by participating in other unit exercise. I had my last stage of training in Thailand where there was a reservist armour battalion ready to pounce on us. Following that, you will recieve your jungle hats either from the instructor or from your S2. Anyway, just keep your chin up. Your mental power is far more stronger than you think. Think positive and all will go well, afterall no training will last forever.<br><br>There are some items to bring along for your course:<br><br>1) OHP markers (non permanent)<br>2) survival kit  in a small plastic box (sewing kit, fishing line, small watch compass, safety pins, waterproof match, small mirror, fish hooks, comdoms, water purifying tablets, small surgical blades etc)<br>3) pace counter (if you hate tying knots for navigation)<br>4) silva compass (even if you are not TC or DY)<br>5) lots of black tape<br>6) tatical torchlight (tape up the lens, so that only a small hole remains)<br>7) ranger eye (get some of those self-luminous strip to sew on the back of your jockey cap)<br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"> camouflage stick or cream<br>9) scarf<br>10) gloves (half finger)<br>11) extra water bottles<br><br>Items (1-10) should be part of your SBO. Do cultivate the habit to secure every of your items especially the optics and signal equipment if you don't want to sign 1206. Silence all moving parts as sound invites enemies. Use comscord to tie the lens of NVGs to its main body before move out.<br><br>During the course when moving out for exercise or training, it is almost exclusively FBO. With FBO, you will need to paint your face including your lips and keep your mouth shut unless you want to paint your teeth.<br><br>I was trained under the course commander callsign "dragon". But you people in the later batch are lucky, as far as I know, the frequencies of power PT has decreased. As for combat survival, I guess it will be a washed down version in light of the recent mishap.<br><br>Most important is that as long as you tell yourself you can do it, you will be able to do it. Let us all know how you are coping with the training. Welcome to the family, trooper.</div>

I am sure you will do fine in that course. The reason for the half finger glove is that it is too hot in Singapore to be wearing the full glove, however at the end of the day, it is really up to your own preference.<br><br>Whether or not, a vocation is honourable is not that important. What is important is that you do your job and stay alive. Being a recce trooper does require good fitness not only physically but also mentally as we are required to be up in front before the main bulk of our forces arrive. Comparing scout and commandos is akin to comparing apples to oranges. Both vocations have different functions in which the upper echelon decide how to deploy.<br><br>Lastly, enjoy your course and set your own SOPs. This is a good time to foster espirt de corps between your team and you. Look forward to the day when you pass out and when you look back at it in time, it will really be worth it.<br></div>
