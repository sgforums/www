            <div class='col-md body'>ItÂ’s the US that is the only country constantly rejecting the ban on outer space testing  in the past decades.<br>ItÂ’s the US that is the only country insisting on putting the missile defense system that virtually militarizes outer-space.<br>The western world led by the bally country likening to yell Â“ Either you are with US or against USÂ”  can keep mute to their masterÂ’s outer-space ambition but fail to observe the same towards a country practicing its right to protect itself from the bally.<br>ThatÂ’s all the western controlled "fair value" can teach you.<br><br>Transcript from "Count Down with Keith Olbermann"<br><br><blockquote><span style="color: blue;"><br>LetÂ‘s call in nuclear weapons expert Joseph Cirincione, the senior vice president for national security of the Center for American Progress, also co-author of Â“Deadly Arsenals: Tracking Weapons of Mass Destruction.Â”<br><br>Thanks for your time again tonight, sir.<br><br>JOSEPH CIRINCIONE, CO-AUTHOR, Â“DEADLY ARSENALSÂ”: My pleasure, Keith.<br><br>OLBERMANN: Was it a mistake to turn down the Chinese and the Russians when they offered to negotiate setting ground rules for weapons in space? And might this be an attempt by the Chinese now to get the Bush administration back to the bargaining table?<br><br>CIRINCIONE: It was definitely a mistake to turn them down. I condemn the Chinese test. ThereÂ‘s no justification for that test. But there is an explanation. <strong>For the last six years, the Bush administration has been yelling loudly about our intentions to militarize space. </strong>WeÂ‘ve established a U.S. Space Command. We talk about space dominance. We have a half-dozen very expensive space weapons on the drawing boards. We have insisted that we have an unimpeded access to space, but weÂ‘ve also insisted on our right to knock out other countriesÂ‘ satellites.<br><br><strong>We have voted against efforts to have treaties that would ban these kinds of weapons. In October 2005, 160 nations at the United Nations voted for a treaty to ban weapons in space. The U.S. was the only nation  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"> that voted against that treaty. </strong>China has gotten the hint. They say, You want a race? OK, bring it on.<br><br>OLBERMANN: So if we donÂ‘t get back into negotiations with the Chinese, the Russians, if we donÂ‘t go along with the U.N. proposal, are we looking, realistically, at another nuclear arms race, only this one with the weapons pointed outwards?<br><br>CIRINCIONE: <strong>The race is already on. WeÂ‘ve been racing by ourselves.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"> </strong>China has now joined that race. TheyÂ‘ve demonstrated that they have a capability, as we do, to launch a missile that could knock out a satellite. <strong>The trouble is, weÂ‘re the big losers in that competition. We have over 420 satellites in space, more than the rest of the world combined. China has only about 34.</strong><br><br><strong>We have more to lose from such a race. You have two choices here. Either you start this race, which will cost hundreds of billions of dollars, and require us to harden our satellites, maneuver our satellites, have spare satellites to go into space, and develop antisatellite weapons of our own. Or you negotiate a ban on any weapons in space and stop this madness before it gets started.</strong><br><br>OLBERMANN: Not to get too cynical from the beginning on this, but was the idea here in our refusal to be involved in this, that we should not be banning weapons in space, because whether or not they ultimately worked, developing them for this country would be forth hundreds of million dollars to American defense contractors?<br><br>CIRINCIONE: You donÂ‘t have to be an Eisenhower scholar or have seen the documentary Â“Why We FightÂ” to know that there really is a military-industrial complex, and thereÂ‘s a lot of money to be made in weapons, particularly space weapons. Space is very expensive and very profitable. And what we have here is a fusion of that military-industrial complex with the ideologues in the White House that is propelling us towards a space race.<br><br>My only hope is that the next administration will come to its senses and stop this madness and negotiate a treaty that preserves the peaceful uses of space for all nations, including the United States.<br><br>OLBERMANN: Something else we have to keep our fingers crossed about through the beginning of Â‘09. But in the short term, before that, if the Chinese are capable now of shooting down one of their own satellites in space, are there military implications for what else they might be able to do back here on the planet?<br><br>CIRINCIONE: Oh, certainly. They just demonstrated the capability to shoot whatÂ‘s called a low-earth-orbiting satellite. Most of our space surveillance and tracking systems are in those low-earth orbits. So they could knock out our eyes, ears, sensors in space. They could cripple U.S. military operations in any conflict.<br><br>And it opens up this interesting, unresolved question of where oneÂ‘s territory ends. The Chinese are saying, The space above our land is our territory. ThereÂ‘s no clear law on this. ThatÂ‘s oneÂ—another reason to negotiate a treaty, to clarify that everyone has a right to space.<br><br>OLBERMANN: Yes, why would we ever have wanted a treaty to stop anything like that?</span></blockquote></div>
