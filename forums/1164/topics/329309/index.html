              <h1>Afghan dam triumph as 1,600 British troops carry out most daring raid 'since Second World War'</h1>
              <p>British troops used a mixture of bribery, trickery and bombs to mount one the most daring operations since the Second World War.</p>
              <p>In
              an extraordinary operation, a huge force was responsible for driving a
              massive hydroelectric turbine through the heart of Helmand - so
              engineers can complete Afghanistan's biggest reconstruction project.</p>
              <p>It
              was the largest operation British forces have mounted in Afghanistan
              since the early 1900s, and it will let the Americans finish a project
              they started more than 50 years ago.</p>
              <p>At least 1,600 troops were
              involved in clearing the route and guarding a 200 vehicle convoy that
              delivered more than 100 tons of turbine to the Kajaki dam on Monday.</p>
              <p><img class="blkBorder" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2008/09/02/article-1051708-027F0F1700000578-813_468x309.jpg" alt="dam" width="468" height="309"></p>
              <div class="clear"></div>
              <p class="imageCaption">Mission: More than 1,600 troops were needed to ensure the turbine got to the Kajaki dam in safety</p>
              <p>They were backed by two US aircraft carriers worth of fighter jets, on constant standby off the Pakistani coast.</p>
              <p>The hydroelectric power station, in northern Helmand, has potential to supply most of southern Afghanistan with energy.</p>
              <p>But
              US-led engineers have been unable to get a new turbine into the power
              station because the area is surrounded by thousands of Taliban fighters.</p>
              <p>The
              turbine was too heavy to fly in by helicopter and officials insisted it
              was too dangerous to drive by road, because the massive tank
              transporters - needed to carry the industrial parts -  can only move at
              a few miles per hour over the rough Helmand roads.</p>
              <div class="clear"></div>
              <p>It
              has been a source of huge embarrassment for American officials, because
              very little progress has been made since 2001, despite millions of
              dollars poured into the project, and they have heaped pressure on
              British forces to help them out.</p>
              <p>Until, recently, the only way
              they could get there was along the deadly 611 Highway, which runs the
              length of Helmand's Green Zone past Lashkargah, Gereshk and Sangin.</p>
              <p>The road is so dangerous that troops at the dam are only ever moved and resupplied by helicopter.</p>
              <p><img src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2008/09/02/article-1051708-027F0F0A00000578-684_468x349.jpg" alt="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2008/09/02/article-1051708-027F0F0A00000578-684_468x349.jpg"></p>
              <p class="imageCaption">The dam will eventually provide energy to much of southern Afghanistan</p>
              <div class="clear"></div>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Military
              chiefs feared the convoy would get smashed by Taliban ambushes, which
              could have destroyed the precision made machinery with one well-aimed
              rocket propelled grenade.</p>
              <p>But all that changed after elite troops
              from the Parachute Regiment's Pathfinder Platoon discovered a mountain
              pass which meant the convoy could avoid the worst  of the Helmand
              hotspots.</p>
              <p>'If we had brought it up the 611, the level of
              destruction we would have had to cause would not have been worth it,'
              said Lieutenant Colonel Huw Williams, the commanding officer of 3rd
              Battalion, the Parachute Regiment.</p>
              <p>'Our pathfinder platoon found this route, and that's really what made it possible,' he added.</p>
              <div class="thinFloatRHS"><img class="blkBorder" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2008/09/02/article-1051708-027F2E5C00000578-777_233x274.jpg" alt="map" width="233" height="274"></div>
              <p>'We have gone from what was militarily very difficult, but politically very desirable, to militarily achievable.</p>
              <p>'It's
              a political showpiece, but it will deliver something tangible, and it
              is militarily achievable. That's what changed in the last month.'</p>
              <p>The
              pathfinders proved the 36-wheeled tank transporters could make it
              through the Gorak Pass, in the mountains about 15miles south east of
              Kajaki.</p>
              <p>It meant the convoy could drive through the desert
              from Kandahar Airfield, where it was based, and only cross into Helmand
              at the last minute.</p>
              <p>The new route was code-named Route Harriet and kept top secret.</p>
              <p>The
              British government issued a blanket ban on all media reports linked to
              the operation - which was only lifted once the turbine had arrived.</p>
              <p>Meanwhile the rest of the Parachute Regiment was tasked with making that last stretch, through Helmand, safe.</p>
              <p>The
              convoy still had to drive through Kajaki Sofla, an insurgent safe haven
              to the south of the dam, which was laced with underground bunkers and
              tunnel systems, and</p>
              <p>almost completely unvisited by international forces.</p>

              <p>Their first step was to trick the Taliban into thinking they would use the 611.</p>
              <p>As
              hundreds of troops helicoptered into Kajaki, soldiers further down the
              valley in Sangin began clearing the road as if they were expecting a
              convoy.</p>
              <p>'We tried to look at what they were expecting - and
              there's only one road,' said Lt Col Williams. 'We were just trying to
              play to their preconceived ideas.'</p>

              <p class="imageCaption">British Royal Marines on duty in Kajaki: The army has fought a long campaign against Taliban militants in the area</p>
              <p>Then
              at 6.30am on Tuesday 26 August, around 150 soldiers from 2nd Battalion
              the Parachute Regiment, backed by more than 400 Afghan troops and their
              Royal Irish mentors, pushed south out of their base, on the edge of the
              dam, to probe the Taliban lines.</p>
              <p>The night before Lt Col Williams had told them, 'The whole world is watching to see what the Parachute Regiment can do'.</p>
              <p>'There
              are reports of more fighters coming into the area. That's more people
              to kill and I have got no problem with killing them,' he added.</p>
              <p>'You've got everything you need to do the job and it's war fighting rules of engagement. If you see it, smash it.'</p>
              <p>Fighter jets, drones and a fleet of Apache helicopter gunships were already crowding the skies as the men left camp.</p>
              <p>Artillery
              guns and two mortar lines were primed to hit known Taliban compounds to
              their south, while troops on nearby hilltops watched their progress
              through the sights of Javelin anti-tank missiles and 50 calibre machine
              guns.</p>
              <p>Moments after the troops set off, the Taliban launched a volley of missiles at the camp.</p>
              <p>One landed less than ten metres outside a compound where a company of men were waiting on standby.</p>
              <p>A second skimmed a few metres over a hilltop look out. Both were met with what the Paras call 'overwhelming force'.</p>
              <p>The
              Apaches opened up with hellfire missiles and 30mm canons, fighter jets
              dropped at least three 500lb bombs  on a single compound.</p>
              <p>The 105 artillery guns fired more than 160 shells and the mortars fired more than 300 rounds.</p>
              <p>'It is an example of our might,' said Major Ben Howells. 'It is sending a message as well as having a military effect.</p>
              <p>'The military effect is to destroy the enemy and the positions that he has, in order to get the turbine through.</p>
              <p>'The message it sends is this: We're more powerful than you, your best course of action is not to fight us.'</p>
              <div class="clear"></div>
              <p>Late
              that night the convoy left Kandahar. It stretched six miles from start
              to finish. the dust trail could be seen more than 20miles away.</p>
              <p>There
              were around 200 vehicles and 400 men, including oil tankers carrying
              80,000 litres of fuel, at least two sea containers full of drinking
              water - to keep the troops alive - and one with 84 spare wheels for the
              HETS tank transporters. But it made slow progress.</p>
              <p>'The
              trucks that they are using were designed to take tanks along German
              motorways,' said Lt Col Willams. 'They are not designed to go along
              dusty desert tracks.;</p>
              <p>On Thursday  August 28 around 500
              Afghan troops took two key Taliban positions - known as Big top and
              Sentry Compound - linked by a complex network of tunnels, bunkers and
              rat-runs. It took them less than 35 minutes.</p>
              <p><span style="font-size: small;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">A rifle in one hand and a teapot in the other...</span></span></p>
              <p>Eyewitnesses said the lead soldier charged into battle with a rifle in one hand and a teapot in the other.</p>
              <p>They had been in the middle of breakfast when the order came in, to advance.</p>
              <p>They suffered two casualties. A soldier was wounded when a sniper hit him in the hip.</p>
              <p>A second died fishing - with a generator - when he electrocuted himself by putting live leads in the water.</p>
              <p>British
              officers said around 50 Taliban were killed, and another 50 fled the
              area. American Green Berets were operating to the south of the Paras,
              in support.</p>
              <p>An American spokesman said at least 200 Taliban were killed.</p>
              <p>Then, on Saturday August 30 British soldiers tried to cut a deal.</p>
              <p>Using local elders as go-betweens with the Taliban, they offered $25,000 (£12,500) in exchange for safe passage of the convoy.</p>
              <p>The cash was offered as compensation for closing the local bazaar for a week.</p>
              <p>'We
              knew they were talking to the Taliban, but our deal was with the local
              elders,' said Captain Steve Boardman, who led the negotiations.</p>
              <p>The
              elders agreed, on the understanding the Paras would not search their
              compounds, nor stray more than 300 metres from the road.</p>
              <p>Hours later intelligence reports showed insurgents had been removing and destroying roadside bombs in the road.</p>
              <p>But by morning the deal was off.</p>

              <p>'We
              took them the papers to sign and no one turned up,' Capt Boardman
              added. 'I think the local Taliban agreed, but their highers in Pakistan
              said no.'</p>
              <p>Afghan troops used VHF radios to harangue the Taliban across no mans land.</p>
              <p>When
              one of the soldiers asked why they wouldn't let the turbine through the
              insurgent replied: 'We don't need electricity. We have Islam.'</p>
              <p>Undeterred, three companies of paratroopers pushed through Kajaki Sofla stopping only to destroy a few pockets of resistance.</p>
              <p>Most
              of the insurgents appeared to have fled. They left behind a series of
              freshly dug trench systems, linking underground bunkers overlooking the
              road.</p>
              <p>The convoy arrived late on Monday night and took more
              than six hours to unload. It still has to make it back, and it could be
              more than two years before Afghans get the benefit of the new equipment.</p>
              <p>George Wilder, the Texan engineer overseeing a Chinese company<br>refurbishing the powerhouse, said the powerlines need upgrading all the way to Kandahar to handle their new load.</p>
              <p>And that's after the new turbine is installed.</p>
              <p>'We've
              got a year to do it,' he said. 'But I think we can do it in nine
              months, depending how much I keep my foot on their arse.'</p>
