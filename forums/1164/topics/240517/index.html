            <div class='col-md body'>Its no secret that Singapore has a pretty friendly relationship with US, with some of the more evident signs of this being our men training there and the majority of our air force equipment US made. By any means, this relationship has brought us a fair amount of benefits like the US-Singapore FTA...etc. But to some extent, I feel that this relationship will really become a liability someday. Taiwan, of course would be one of the few flashpoints in Asia. How would the Chinese react if Changi Naval Base were to used as a resupply point for the CVNs. Would Singapore be unwillingly implicated any of Uncle Sam's stunts in the Asia-Pacific region? Terrorists have already stated Singapore as a target due to our close links to the US.What you think? Is our present relationship a liability or a blessing?</div>

Both Singapore and the United States are distinctly different countries with different national agendas and interests. There is absolutely no guarantee that our national interests will always coincide with each other. What if it comes to a point that we have very serious difference in views with the Yanks and we have to stand our ground? Not a very new thing for us. The term "free world" is a very subjective one. I have absolutely no issue with the Yanks but I still think its rather unwise to align one way or the other.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>CNB is a stopover not only for the US ships, but also other nationalities. So I do not think, SG is kowtowing to US.<br><br>Futhermore, as someone here mentioned, I do agree that with some US personnel and equipment on our soil, it acts as a deterrent for any would be regional aggressor who may want to do a surprise attack [that is, if they have the capability at all] against SG. Hit the wrong target, and WHAM, the aggressor will have a lot of answering to do to the US.<br><br>And, SG will stand neutral if there's a fight between China and Taiwan. What are close relationships with SG and China for than?<br><br>Anyway, I believe Taiwan should go back to China. It's part of China anyway. Taiwan behaves in such a way because they THINK the US will come to their aid if China attacks. Taiwan managed to conned the US to sign a pack to ensure US will come to Taiwan's aid if China attacks. That was BEFORE US companies made a significant investment in China. Now US is in a bind. Their companies have too much at stake in China in terms of investment to allow US Gov to fight China, at the same time US have to fulfill their commitment to Taiwan.<br><br>Perhaps, eventually, US will only help to evacuate those Taiwanese who want to escape Taiwan in the event of the real China-Taiwan war. Just like in Vietnam. This is my opinion.</div>
