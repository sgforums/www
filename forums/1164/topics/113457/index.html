            <div class='col-md body'>A knife enthusiast! As far as i know is that they issue a parang to the section 2IC in an infantry section and the rather new Swiss army knife.The Swiss knife is so much more sharper than the old Jack knife.They also issue bayonets but usually very blunt can cut anything but only useful for stabbing. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"></div>

Actually cut down several trees (about 2 min per tree) using one during my course.  Also used it for cutting down a few trees to hide our recce jeep.  Didn't even need camo-net to hide the jeep.  hehe..</div>

But I've personally encounter problems with it so, I'm not a fan of it.  I would rather carry separated tool parts if necessary.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br><br>So, do Singapore army train its soldier to the importants of a good knife?  Remember, a knife will never run out of ammo, jam up when you need it most or weight more then a quater of your own body mass.  As long as you maintain it properly, you can do just about any survival needs with a knife.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_twisted.gif" alt="Twisted Evil" title="Twisted Evil"></div>

That said, we did have some limited training in knife fighting in the unarmed combat program, and jungle survival did teach us the value of a good knife.</div>
