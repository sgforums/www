Ask yourself -  will any self-respecting combatant adhereing to the 3 principles of camouflage and concealment (Shadow, Shine and Sound) present himself such an easy target? But really, the cost of the thermals won't burn a hole in one's pocket - it'll burn your pants right off to equip every man with one (despite the fact they are mass purchased).

                  foremost: having to supply a unit with more than 1 ammunition
                  calibre type is a logistical burden. Secondly, it costs extra -
                  something the SAF is not in the least willing to spend on (for

              <p style="line-height: normal; margin: 0in 0in 10pt;"><strong><span style="color: black; font-size: 12pt;">What we could
                  possibly do is give the sharpshooter a better scope (windage,
                  elevation, magnification etc.), a heavier barrel with a greater
                  twist ratio to increase muzzle velocity and accuracy. For good
                  measure, they might want to consider a bipod.</span></strong></p>

                  RIS’ and mass purchased reflex optics and foregrips would not cost
                  significantly more than the standard configuration at hand.
                  Instead, the benefits of it would be a logarithmic rise in combat
                  proficiency – as the USMC has experienced. Fine, so you say one
                  should not rely on batteries to keep one’s weapon system operable.
                  So let me ask you: why did the USMC and the IDF equip its operators

                  with infra-red capabilities! I hear in NS for night-firing,
                  reflective material is stuck onto the targets. Ask yourself - 
                  will any self-respecting combatant adhereing to the 3 principles of
                  camouflage and concealment (Shadow, Shine and Sound) present
                  himself such an easy target? But really, the cost of the thermals

                  to equip every man with one (despite the fact they are mass
                  purchased). But you're right, night fighting should be given more

              <p>Hey Moderator Shotgun,</p>
              <p><strong>For the most of the reply, logic eludes me.</strong> and <strong>Most of the remaining arguments revolve around "too costly" which I largely agree with. -</strong> are my comments sound or otherwise?</p>
              <p><strong>SAF does already equip units with more than one ammunition type.  Just not all... I think the cost of the semi-auto 7.62 would be more than equipping them with the bullets.</strong></p>
              <p>I'm not very certain but as far as I know, only the Steyr bolt-action sniper rifles we use are chambered in 7.62mm (excluding the FN FALs we purchased when we first began).</p>
              <p><strong>From what I understand, twist ratio and stuff like that aren't just randomly increased or decreased.  </strong></p>
              <p>I believe Zalman Sheves has done it with the Tavor 21 (one of its selling points is its increase in muzzle velocity due to an increased twist ratio). Heavier barrels are common in many rifles designs such as the Steyr AUG H-Bar, the M16 H-Bar and even the modern FN SCAR. A heavier barrel stabilizes the barrel's vibrations when the round exits the muzzle, thus improving barrel harmonics and accuracy.</p>
              <p><strong>The twist and its effectiveness depends on the type of 5.56 used.  </strong></p>
              <p>I was referring to the 5.56x45mm cartridge. Furthermore, to the extent of my knowledge, I believe that the only 5.56mm cartridges in manufacture are .223 Remington and 5.56x45mm NATO. </p>
              <p><strong>The final 2 paragraphs are appeals to emotions which can be disregarded.</strong></p>
              <p>I apologise, allow me to rephrase my stand:</p>
              <p>When all is said and done, it is the operator's professional skill and level of training - combat and survival, what it takes to fight and win - that will stand one in good stead in a harsh combat environment.</p>

              <p>In regards to the use of P-rails for the SAR-21, the weapon was designed in 1996, at the time where the use of modular mounting systems had yet to become widespread in militaries around the world. The SAF wanted a standardized weapon that could be distributed to each and every grunt without too much fuss, but yet have some bells and whistles. The P-Rail variants were mainly for export.</p>
              <p>This was before the Army 21 vision, which was before the 3G SAF transformation. Of course the reality of small arms in the 3G SAF has changed significantly. The requirements of the 3G SAF means that the need for modular flexibility has arisen. Hence, I'd expect if the SAF was serious to transiting to a network centric force they would naturally transit towards using SAR-21 variants with modular mounting systems.</p>
              <p><br>Personally, I feel the SAR-21 would be a lot better if it was given modular flexibility. The current sights on the basic variant are adequate, but could be a lot better. Even if the government does not want to spend to give us red dots and ACOGs, they can still retain the option to use the cheapo sight on P-rail. But of course, such decisions were made like in 1996, and they have to run through the production contracts and what have you not.</p>

              <p>Logic eludes me in why you concluded that it was expensive for the SAF to issue to ammunition types, when the cost of the 7.62 weapon itself would have cost significantly more.  Just an odd conclusion there.</p>
              <p>The other odd part was your Russian-German example. The Russians were outnumbered, and then they came back with 1.5million men?

              <p>Its not just the old Steyr 69s, we also use 7.62 x 51mm NATO rounds for our GPMGs. So yes, we do have quite a fair quantity of those.</p>
              <p>The 5.56 x 45mms themselves come in different types meant for different barrel twists.  The M193 ball works with the 1:12" barrel twists (ie M16A1), and the M855 with the 1:7" barrel twists (ie M16A2/A3/A4).</p>
              <p>An M855 shot out of an M16A1 would not be sufficiently stabilized, while accuracy may be degrade when the M193 is shot out of 1:7" barrels. But i suppose a mild increment in twist might be acceptable.  Still that would mean a new version of hbar Sar-21.</p>

              <p>Hey SgTyrannosaur,</p>
              <p>I have to concur with you that the SAF did have good reason to use the current sighting systems - not simply because the SAF is ignorant of better options or is too ass-poor to give them to us.</p>
              <p>Furthermore, if one thinks about it, a1.5x scope isn't too bad at all. While it isn't optimum for close quarter rapid engagements (as compared to reflex sights), it does allow us to engage targets pretty well outside a room clearance situation.</p>
              <p>Hey Moderator Shotgun,</p>
              <p><strong>Logic eludes me in why you concluded that it was expensive for the SAF to issue to ammunition types, when the cost of the 7.62 weapon itself would have cost significantly more.  Just an odd conclusion there.</strong></p>
              <p>Reviewing my previous comments, I have to concur. What I really meant was that to purchase 7.62mm weapon systems (inevitably complete with ammo supply) would prove exceedingly costly for the SAF. And I still cannot very if our GPMGs use 7.62mm, a likely possiblility but probably phased out though (in favor of using a standard caliber - 5.56x45mm).</p>
              <p><strong>The other odd part was your Russian-German example. The Russians were outnumbered, and then they came back with 1.5million men? I think the Russians weren't really that outnumbered in the first place... just not as prepared as they ought to be.  The Russians did outnumber the Germans on the way back I think...</strong></p>
              <p>Haha! I'm terribly sorry for not including proper details! Maybe to have a more concrete understanding of that segment of WW2, you might want to read Tim McNeese's Stalingrad - Sieges that changed the world (available at local libraries). But seriously, the Russians pioneered urban warfare in the 20th century and the War earned them a fearsome fighting reputation among the West (see spetsnaz books and US Army publications)</p>
              <p><strong>Its not just the old Steyr 69s, we also use 7.62 x 51mm NATO rounds for our GPMGs. So yes, we do have quite a fair quantity of those.</strong></p>
              <p>Like I mentioned earlier I am hazy about the GPMG - it may have been phased out in  favour of a standard 5.56 mm caliber.</p>
              <p><strong>The 5.56 x 45mms themselves come in different types meant for different barrel twists.  The M193 ball works with the 1:12" barrel twists (ie M16A1), and the M855 with the 1:7" barrel twists (ie M16A2/A3/A4).</strong></p>

              <p>Not at all Shotgun, you were quite right. However, they might find more place on the ground rather than in a strictly technical discussion (see US Army Field manual on Psychological ops)</p>

              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Arial;">Hey Sepecat,</span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"> </p>
              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Arial;"><strong>SAF spent $100 million on AMCS.<span> </span> Cost is not an issue for SAF if</strong></span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Arial;"><strong>the capability <span> </span>is deemed necessary. <span> </span></strong></span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Arial;"><strong></strong></span> </p>
              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Arial;"><span>Yep, you are right to a large extent; if the SAF wants it done, it will get it done with the DEFMIN's approval. However, do bear in mind our other expenses (1 - Education, etc.) which require much more attention presently as they are quite outdated in my view.</span></span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Arial;"><strong></strong></span> </p>
              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Arial;"><strong>But, <span> </span>personally I am not convinced of the reliability and effectiveness of such a system – this shud be discussed in another thread.</strong></span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Arial;"><strong></strong></span> </p>
              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Arial;">This is in fact being debated hotly by top militaries all around the world. Personally, I endorse the move in general. However I disagree with the SAF on some things which I shall discuss below.</span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Arial;"> </span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Arial;"><strong>As an infantryman like most of us , I think <span> </span>more shud be spent to correct major shortfalls in SAF section small arms capabilities, <span> </span>specifically &amp; especially night sight equipment. We do not even have a basic plain vanilla one.</strong></span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Arial;"> </span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Arial;">Absolutely! As I have mentioned in previous comments, I have heard that we train our soldiers for night shooting by pasting reflective material on the targets, then telling them to use their LAD to engage their targets throught the scope. This I believe is extremely unrealistic training. Furthermore, our soldiers receive far too little range time to be of much help - I shall likewise discuss this further below. </span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"> </p>
              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Arial;"><strong>We have taken one step forward with the 1.5X sight on the SAR 21 and taken one step backward <span> </span>when a basic night sight is non existent <span> </span>– even the <span> </span>old SAF M16 had a basic tritium front post sight. </strong></span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Arial;"><strong></strong></span> </p>
              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Arial;"><span>Well a simple way of improving the current version is to use a tritium scope.<strong> </strong></span><span><strong> </strong></span></span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Arial;"><strong> </strong></span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Arial;"><strong>Lack of P rails &amp; night sight and weight <span> </span>are major shortfalls for SAR21.</strong></span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Arial;"><strong></strong></span> </p>
              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Arial;">Once again refer to my first comments in the thread about the LAD and Picatinny rails. Weight management is excellent in terms of placing the CG above the firing hand. Weight overall is pretty crappy for <em>current bullpup</em> ARs, specifically those made by Microtech Inc. </span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Arial;"><strong> </strong></span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Arial;"><strong>Inability of Ultimax to use SAR21 standard magazines is a another major shortfall. Lack of field refillable drum mags such as C mags for Ultimax limits</strong></span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Arial;"><strong>the capabilities of a good weapon. </strong></span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Arial;"><strong></strong></span> </p>
              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Arial;">Right you are - BTW, Betaco does sell speed reloaders for such purposes. The SAF I feel has grossly neglected its small arms sector after the intial sucess of the SAR 21.</span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Arial;"><strong></strong></span><span style="font-family: Arial;"><strong></strong></span> </p>
              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Arial;"><strong>Lack<span> </span> of <span> </span>telescopic sights means that the</strong></span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Arial;"><strong>full range of Ultimax 100 is not exploited.</strong></span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Arial;"><strong></strong></span> </p>
              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Arial;">True, but they are probably given to special ops. The SAF isn't counting on us to win wars.</span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Arial;"><strong> </strong></span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Arial;"><strong>Having one 7.62 semi auto sharpshooter rifle will increase reach and firepower of the SAF section. <span> </span>Having 2 different calibers is not a major issue unless one wants to use match ammo<span> </span> - but then a sharpshooter fires mainly single deliberate shots and requires less ammo in the first place. </strong></span><span style="font-family: Arial;"><strong>GPMGs at company level already exist and the ammo is already there. In Afghanistan and Iraq , the lesson learnt is that a 7.62<span> </span> weapon<span> </span> is<span> </span> sorely needed in many situations at squad / section<span> </span> level. <span> </span></strong></span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Arial;"><strong></strong></span> </p>
              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Arial;"><span>I concur wholly. However, the SAF isn't going to spend more time, effort and money to train and equip Designated Marksmen. Sad but true.</span></span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Arial;"><strong> </strong></span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Arial;"><strong>It is also less important if the 5.56 ammo is M855 or M193. What is more critical is that hits are achieved and modern sights coupled with good and intensive training make it possible.  </strong></span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Arial;"><strong></strong></span> </p>
              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Arial;">Yes, I believe strongly that the SAF does not make an effort to train our soldiers to a level of combat proficiency. For instance, we train with far less than 300 rounds per operator - ridiculous if you observe weapons training courses. </span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"> </p>
              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Arial;">Our "soldiers" train in the prone shooting position, the most stable position with the lowest CG. In war, I doubt most of your shots will be fired from a prone position, seriously.</span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"> </p>
              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Arial;">Our "soldiers" train to fire their rifles comfortably as if for leisure. Their heart rate is not up, ther blood is not pumping, their adrenaline isn't rushing. One should be trained to engage multiple targets from all 3 firing positions, running to engage, runnung while engaging, all under time constraint, in full dress complete with kitted out LBV. </span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"> </p>
              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Arial;">Our "soldiers" are not trained to reload under stress. Reloading should be a conditioned reflex.</span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"> </p>
              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Arial;">Shooting accurately under duress requires much practice, repetition and perfection of marksmanship. What our "soldiers" undergo is quite ludicrous.</span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Arial;"><strong></strong></span> </p>
              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Arial;"><strong></strong></span> </p>
              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Arial;"><strong>It scares the hell out of an enemy who knows that a normal infantryman shoots straight and makes consistent hits in all scenarios. Thats why US Marines &amp; other similar well equipped and trained  forces are well respected by their enemies.</strong></span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Arial;"><strong></strong></span> </p>
              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Arial;">Absolutely correct! Only hits count, misses don't. here is the US rifleman's creed for one to ponder.</span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"> </p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial;"></span>
              </p><p> </p>
              <p></p>
              <p><em>This is my rifle. </em><em>There are many like it, but this one is mine. </em></p>
              <p><em>My rifle is my best friend. It is my life. I must master it as I master my life. </em></p>
              <p><em>My rifle, without me, is useless. Without my rifle, I am useless. </em></p>
              <p><em>I must fire my rifle true. I must shoot straighter than my enemy who is trying to kill me. I must shoot him before he shoots me. I will....</em></p>
              <p><em><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>My rifle and myself know that what counts in this war is not the rounds we fire, the noise of our burst, nor the smoke we make. We know that it is the hits that count. We will hit...</strong></span></em></p>
              <p><em>My rifle is human, even as I, because it is my life. Thus, I will learn it as a brother. I will learn its weakness, its strength, its parts, its accessories, its sights and its barrel. </em></p>
              <p><em>I will keep my rifle clean and ready, even as I am clean and ready. We will become part of each other. We will...</em></p>
              <p><em>Before God I swear this creed. My rifle and myself are the defenders of my country. </em></p>
              <p><em>We are the masters of our enemy. We are the saviors of my life. </em></p>
              <p><em>So be it, until victory is America's and there is no enemy, but Peace.</em></p>

              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt 1in;"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;"> </span></span></p>

              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt 1in;"><strong><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 8pt;">As an infantryman like most of us , I think  more shud be spent to correct major shortfalls in SAF section small arms capabilities,  specifically &amp; especially night sight equipment. We do not even have a basic plain vanilla one.</span></strong><span style="font-size: 8pt;"></span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt 1in;"><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 8pt;"> </span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"></span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt 1in;"><strong><span style="font-family: Arial; color: blue; font-size: 8pt;">Absolutely! As I have mentioned in previous comments, I have heard that we train our soldiers for night shooting by pasting reflective material on the targets, then telling them to use their LAD to engage their targets throught the scope. This I believe is extremely unrealistic training. Furthermore, our soldiers receive far too little range time to be of much help - I shall likewise discuss this further below. </span></strong></p>
              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt 1in;"><strong><span style="font-family: Arial; color: blue; font-size: 8pt;"> </span></strong></p>
              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt 1in;"><strong><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black;">If <span> </span>true, then it must be the most ludicrous night aiming technique I have heard of for conventional night fighting. Anyone, please tell me of any other army in the world which teaches this to their infantryman for conventional warfare.</span></strong></p>
              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt 1in;"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;"> </span></span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt 1in;"><strong><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black;">This technique was probably dreamed up by an armchair </span></strong></p>
              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt 1in;"><strong><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black;">bureaucrat . </span></strong></p>
              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt 1in;"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;"> </span></span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt 1in;"><strong><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 8pt;">We have taken one step forward with the 1.5X sight on the SAR 21 and taken one step backward  when a basic night sight is non existent  – even the  old SAF M16 had a basic tritium front post sight. </span></strong><span style="font-size: 8pt;"></span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt 1in;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> </span><strong><span style="font-family: Arial; color: blue; font-size: 8pt;"></span></strong></span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt 1in;"><strong><span style="font-family: Arial; color: blue; font-size: 8pt;">Well a simple way of improving the current version is to use a tritium scope.</span></strong><span style="color: blue; "><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;"> </span></span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt 1in;"><strong><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black;">Yes, if you have a P rail to attach it on in the first place.  </span></strong></p>

              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt 1in;"><strong><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 8pt;">Lack of P rails &amp; night sight and weight  are major shortfalls for SAR21.</span></strong><span style="font-size: 8pt;"></span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt 1in;"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;"> </span></span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt 1in;"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: blue; font-size: 8pt;">Once again refer to my first comments in the thread about the LAD and Picatinny rails. Weight management is excellent in terms of placing the CG above the firing hand. Weight overall is pretty crappy for <em><span style="font-family: Arial;">current bullpup</span></em> ARs, specifically those made by Microtech Inc.</span><span style="color: blue; font-size: 8pt;"></span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt 1in;"><strong><span style="font-family: Arial; color: blue; font-size: 8pt;"> </span></strong></p>
              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt 1in;"><strong><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black;">No argument that SAR21 is nicely balanced. <span> </span>But<span>  </span>its weight is horrendous compared to other modern combat rifles.</span></strong></p>
              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt 1in;"><strong><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 8pt;"> </span></strong></p>
              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt 1in;"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;"> </span></span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt 1in;"><strong><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 8pt;">Inability of Ultimax to use SAR21 standard magazines is a another major shortfall. Lack of field refillable drum mags such as C mags for Ultimax limits</span></strong><span style="font-size: 8pt;"></span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt 1in;"><strong><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 8pt;">the capabilities of a good weapon.</span></strong><span style="font-size: 8pt;"></span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt 1in;"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;"> </span></span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt 1in;"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: blue; font-size: 8pt;">Right you are - BTW, Betaco does sell speed reloaders for such purposes. The SAF I feel has grossly neglected its small arms sector after the intial sucess of the SAR 21.</span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt 1in;"><strong><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black;"> </span></strong></p>
              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt 1in;"><strong><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black;">Yes, but Ultimax 100 round drum mags can only be reloaded in the factory. They can neither <span> </span>be hand loaded nor loaded with any field device. <span> </span></span></strong></p>

              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt 1in;"><strong><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 8pt;">Lack  of  telescopic sights means that the</span></strong><span style="font-size: 8pt;"></span></p>

              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt 1in;"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;"> </span></span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt 1in;"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: blue; font-size: 8pt;">True, but they are probably given to special ops. The SAF isn't counting on us to win wars.</span></p>

              <p>True the 7.62X51mm has more stopping power however, in close in assymetrical warfare, you rarely shoots beyond 200m and the amount of ammo needed to put down range to keep the heads of the enemy down is a lot more. So, the more rounds a soldier can carry, the better.</p>
              <p>This is the main reason NATO and US main small arms main ammo is the M855 or 5.56X45mm SS109 steel penetrator.</p>
              <p>The reason for deployment of the Minimi and the M4 is simple, for the weight of 180 rounds of M80, a soldier can carry rounds of SS109</p>

              <p>I agree that 5.56 mm is good for the shorter ranges &lt;400 m. The 5.56 LMGs are very good to have when assaulting positions. But 7.62s if available as LMGs are very much more effective in laying down fire for suppression and also in stopping power. </p>
              <p>Even urban combat experience in Iraq and Afghanistan there are calls by troopers to have a longer reach - eg    old  M14s rifles  have been taken out from storage and fielded.  On many occassions , the longer ranged rifles are needed to take out targets a few blocks away where they are just beyond the limits of the 5.56. Also the M240s or GPMGs have proven invaluable in providing harder hitting power than 5.56 LMGs.  </p>
              <p>Therefore  there has been a lot of  interest in weapons such as the HK417 and  lighter weight GPMGs such as M60E4  and the 7.62 Minimi.</p>

              <p>What possibly could the arguments about 'Costs"  be centered on ?</p>
              <p>Costs in terms of logistic delivery to the front lines, or the costs to stock up ?</p>
              <p>As matters stand, in terms of bullets used - not including the pistols - the SAF has the 5.56mm for the AR-15s and SAR-21; and 7.62mm needed for the GPMG guns that are used as Company Support Weapon - and which are also mounted on Armoured Vehicles, Tanks and Self-Propelled Guns.</p>
              <p>The SAF also has the 25mm rounds used on the heavy weapons on the Bionix AFV, and on the M113A3 Ultra's, and with some Bionix also utilising the 0.5 inch Heavy Machine Gun.</p>
              <p>The SAF has the logistical support capacity and ability to handle a varied range of ammo types in a very organised and logical chain.</p>
              <p>If a review is made in the use of 7.62mm weapons for the SAF Infantry, then the SAF should take lessons from the experience of the UK Military in Afghanistan, where encounters with enemy combatants are normally found to be beyond the effective range of the 5.56mm rounds, and new 7.62mm weapons are being purchased.</p>

              <p>I doubt the sar-21 is a more effective weapon than its main competitor the AUG from the following observations:</p>

              <p>1)heavier</p>
              <p>2)non STANAG mags</p>

              <p>money nort well spent,,,,,,they should be manufacturing a modern lightweight minigun thats mounted on the waist with bullet cannisters situated in front and at the back all bullet prrof for extra protection.....then if its too heavy they should build it on a mini tracked system powered by a motorbike engine.....</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>a small tracked system no bigger than the bike engine....just attach small tracked system at the side of engine and directly run itinto a high torque gear system.the guns n ammo nwould be mounted from a steel structure that grows out from the engine chasis itself!!</p>
              <p>it beats simply going around all day holding all those dumb heavy rifles or lite machineguns 24hrs /dat 7 days a week!</p>

              <p>anyway its supposedly showcased at the airshow, ill be going this weekend, maybe can get a peek at it.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>hmm  somehow the looks appeal to me, rifle looks, hmmm sounds silly, but it looks focused on functionability haha,  the hand grip looks strange though,  is the flat base for it to rest on the ground or walls for stability?</p>

              <p> doubt the sar-21 is a more effective weapon than its main

              <p>1)heavier</p>
              <p>2)non STANAG mags</p>
              <p>3)fire controls positioned  at the buttstock of the
              rifle</p>
              <p>I cant see why its an effective modern weapon when some rifle
              designed nearly 30 years ago can outdo it on the above, mostly.</p>

              <p>Maybe you need to take a closer look.</p>
              <p>Ultimately the move back then was to replace the STANAG mag with a new system that performs better. The STANAG mag leaves much to be desired in terms of reliability and durability. The switch to polymer mags is not surprising... thou the CHOICE of the SAR-21's polymer mag design is, which introduces compability issues with older systems.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>More interestingly, the SAR-21 export versions could take the STANAG mag. Additionally most of them did away with the cheapo 1.5x scope for modular mounts.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Reliability and safety of the SAR-21 trumps the Aug. Saw the results of the chamber explosion test.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>My take? ST had far more capable versions of the SAR-21 ready... but the SAF chose to go for the bare-bones version instead, which could be considerably improved. Maybe they are waiting for one big upgrade to a better standard variant that could be applied across the board like the SAR-21A? I dunno.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Don't see many issues with the SAR though... harshest critics of it always seem to be local, but the foreign operators using it, sometimes in combat conditions don't seem to be feeding back a lot of scating reviews.</p>

              <p>Probably going to take a while before any of this filters down to the common NSF or NS man.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Problem is not that we don't have the technology to make a better rifle, or have not done it... it's that the military takes pretty long to get about to implementing it, often to the case by the time they did, something better had come up. For 1997 the basic SAR-21 was pretty impressive, but by 2003 it was obvious the design philosphy of trying to provide intergated LADs and scopes to the common grunt all in one standard package was a wrong direction to take given how rapidly modular systems have been developed in the meantime.</p>
              <p>Then of course now with the 3G SAF, modular systems are suddenly so much more practical. I don't see the ACMS using a basic SAR-21.</p>
