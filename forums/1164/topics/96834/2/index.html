Specifically, Glock 19.<br>And on this point, im Foxtrot Charlie Uniform Kilo sure.<br>WHY? because i have personally seen it been carried on the belts of officers at a certain exposition, and it was also exihibited. It was advertised as being the sidearm of the STAR teams.<br>Do you need me to post the picture i took?<br><br>Why do certain law enforcement agencies don't use Glock? Sometimes it comes down to personal pefernece. Maybe they like Beretta. Maybe Browning. Kimber? Sig Sauer? Or maybe they like Korth. If your boss dictates you use this, you jolly well use it.<br><br>You are saying that Glock is a girly gun. Which, by implication, Austria is a Girly Country, as Glock. Inc came into being by suppling a pistol to the Austrian army. So if i carry your statement to the extreme, Germany is a girly state because they issue H&amp;K weapons to their armed forces/LEOs?<br><br>The sidearm the officer is carrying, is a Glock. No two ways about. You can take me at my word, that i can identify more than 70% common weapons at a glance. Even if it is not, it is using a Glock-style lower reciever.<br><br>No, i have not been watching too much lawyer shows. I have spoken with a few Law students, and i can tell you that you do not want to debate with them. some of them literally can turn Black to White.<br><br>And as for your friend, ask him, if you would, if anyone in his agency has gone through a lawsuit by a lawyer who argued "Gentlemen of the jury, the officer in question took extra training, modiefied his weapon beyond service standards, handloaded his ammunition, all just because he wanted to shoot people".<br><br>Besides, being in any agency, no matter how august the name, does not in and of itself signify anything. Has your friend seen the elephant? There are officers who throughout their entire life do not use their sidearms in anger.<br><br>Lastly, even if YOU yourself do not like your Issue Weapon, the people UPSTAIRS like it. After all the examples i have exampled, so many agencies cant be wrong. More to the point, there are statements from police officers themselves that they love their Glocks. They all can't be wrong, can they.<br><br></div>

They were much like the Swiss army knives.  Honestly, I didn't said that the glock guns are girlie but since you've kept insisting that I did, I won't object to your view.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"><br>I know for certain that 1 of the reason why Glock is popular for the law enforcement agencies in U.S is due to the fact that its a light weight weapon which even a girl can carry &amp; use.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br>I can see from your comments that you are a strong supporter for Glocks but have you ever used it?  I've have personally used the glock 28 compact, its light even when loaded with 10 rds of .380.  Theres almost no feel of the recoil kick back when firing, the sights are clear enough to see in a quick draw but it would be better to modify for night shooting.  And again it so light that even a girl can carry &amp; run with it.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"></div>

It can be quite a hassle in a stressful situation &amp; if you're wearing gloves.  Other then that, theres the weight factor.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_eek.gif" alt="Shocked" title="Shocked"><br><br>I m not referring it to any girlie comment between me &amp; johnston, but seriously, the weapon is so light that I sometimes forget that I'm carrying it which can be quite a problem, though it hasn't occur yet.  Thats why I try to carry a slightly heavier gun.  It may be incovenience but at least I know its there.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br><br>The Walther P99 is not a very popular gun even though its been around for a few years already but I like it.  However, its not a gun for concealment especially if you've a small body frame like mine.  Its noticeable even with wearing a coverall. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_neutral.gif" alt="Neutral" title="Neutral"><br><br>With all thats said &amp; done, a hand gun is much better as a secondary weapon.  Preferrable to carrry an assault rifle as primary weapon is always better.  My view is that if you've got to use your secondary weapon after your primary, then you're definately in a deep shit situation.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_twisted.gif" alt="Twisted Evil" title="Twisted Evil"></div>
