MIL and L.E. personnel should be able to have access to pre-ban mags so that shouldn't be a problem.  anyway, if you're on an op, how can you change calibers without changing the barrel and the receiver. now, surely there has to be a caliber that you'd use for the general op. it's all down to personal preference actually. well, if you'd like more ammo but with a degree of stopping power then just use the 9mm jhp?   any comments on .357 cal?<br><br>off-topic: any naval divers here? you guys use sigs yes?<br><br>back to topic:   anyway, sb uses glocks, don't they?</div>

However, do take note about it if you happen to be assign to duties such as those carried out by the U.S Secret Service CAT.  Public reaction can sometimes cause a shooter his shot unless he's got 'green' light to fire into the crowd which happened to the Secret Service, some years back, in South America( if i rememdered it correctly ). <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_neutral.gif" alt="Neutral" title="Neutral"><br>Anyway, as I said, its better to use a silencer/suppressor for whatever purpose.

Hollywood, CA. ).  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mad.gif" alt="Mad" title="Mad"><br><br>Then theres the infamous Waco, Texas shoot-out on February 28 1993.  I remember for sure no FBI agent was having any 10mm ammo in their weapon.  And if FBI is anything to go by, what about the ATF agents?  They weren't using no 10mm ammo when they initiated the storming of the compound.<br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_twisted.gif" alt="Twisted Evil" title="Twisted Evil"></div>

I see, you want a rematch on the <strong>girlie attitude </strong>again huh!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br><br>Anyway its true, about suspects not going down after being shot by a full clip of 9mm at a distance of 15 to 25 feet.  And there are alot of documented cases with regards to the matter.  And 1 of the most famous case is the shooting of an IRA terrorist by the SAS in Gibraltar - March 1988.  Which is why I prefer .40 to .45 ammos.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_twisted.gif" alt="Twisted Evil" title="Twisted Evil"><br><br>Now technical views on why 10mm is worst then 9mm.  As I mentioned earlier, 10mm is very much like .22 cal but the damge effects are different.  For .22 cal, the bullet ricochets within the body of the target causing internal bleeding &amp; damages that is usually beyond repair.  The 10mm ammo used by law enforcers are soft heads.  Meaning that, once it penetrate the target's body, it loose power to even ricochet.  Instead, it depends on the fragmentation of the bullet to cause damge to the target but because the bullet already looses it momentum power upon entry of the target's body, the likely hood of the bullet fragmenting is not reliable.  This is especially if the target has alot of body fats. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mad.gif" alt="Mad" title="Mad"><br><br>9mm ammo tends to over penetrate the body which results in the intended target to still remain on his 2 feet.  However, the damage effects of 9mm is greater in the fact that the target's body have an entry wound &amp; an exit wound.  And I know for sure that if you shoot a target in the shoulder, he is not likely to be able to make use of that arm for the duration of the fire fight.<br><br>So now you might want to counter by saying if 10mm is that bad why the hack is the Feds using it?  The answer is that the Feds want their targets alive for prosecution inorder for them to show their positive results in the press.  But cops need ammo that not only enable them to protect the public but also for themselves to survive the fire fight. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_eek.gif" alt="Shocked" title="Shocked"></div>
