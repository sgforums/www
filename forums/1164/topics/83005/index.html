What i am suggesting is a concentrated, focus effort to groom our own sporting talent.  Over the year, i am sure many sporting talents have been overlooked and gone down the drain.  I have witness many very good soccer players during my NS, but they have never been cultivated nor groomed.  It's a pity.</div>

They would train, sleep, eat sports on their selected field.<br><br>Advantage :<br><br>1.   Home grown sportsman, lesser reliance on foreign import<br>2.   No distraction such as school work, girlfriend problem etc<br>3.   Full focus on achieving results<br>4.   May make Dream 2010 happen.<br>5.   Excellent diet control in SAF.<br><br>They would be subjected to the same strict SAF discipline.  Any slackers in training is subjected to extra training, corrective training over the weekend as with other soldier.....<br><br>Winning medals for Singapore in International arena is NATIONAL SERVICE in my opinion.<br><br>What's your thought.<br><br></div></blockquote>That already been done long ago, usually the sports folks will get be exempted from the normal duty, have seen a couple of them, who usually not even in the camp, just come back a few day every few months to update their admin, they totally disappear, althought they are in the platoon list.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote>my point is using NS time to groom our sports talent</blockquote>It's outside of any of the uniformed services' business, to be honest, with regards to training &amp; deploying conscripts.<br><br>If you think about it, who's to say the athletes would greatly benefit from such a programme anyway? Esp. if they require specialized sporting instructions which the uniformed forces can't plausibly provide (but which a foreign university can).<br><br>One solution, I suggest, would be the idea of extending draftable age to the late 20something's, partly to allow civilian youths to exploit their potential (whatever field) to the max. Both Taiwan &amp; South Korea don't restrict their NS call-ups to the 18-20 year old batches, though they have their own motivations. But, applied to Singapore, that'll likely impact the composition of our reservist corps to some degree.</div>

Anything that will do good for the benefit of our Nation...hence NATIONAL SERVICE, providing service to our nation..</div>
