              <p><br>The SMs are on the other hand Mach 4-6 weapons, and are very small targets to hit.</p>
              <p>The weapon that the USN is troubled about most is the Klub system. One version carries a second stage that dives at a blazing ~Mach 2.9 with evasive patterns deployed. Now that is what I call a decent anti-ship missile.</p>

              <p>We get the point, you can use SMs as an anti-ship, though if there are missiles incoming and an enemy warship in range, the question becomes "which one do you shoot?" (Pss: Answer? Both of them. You have more than one launch cell. :P )</p>
              <p>Darth, that is a scary missile. Another one I have my eye on is the potential Brahmos Mk 2. Mach 5+ with possible terminal evasion. Launch it from a plane at Mach 2 and I've absolutely NO idea what it's closing speed is going to be. It's going to be a bitch to stop though.</p>

              <p>Quote my old post,</p>
              <p>RIM-66 has only been fired anti-ship by a Perry class FFG in the 80s, meaning to say
                                      when the US retired the Separate Target Illumination Radar together with the Mk13 launcher the capability went too.</p>
              <p>There's still hope that other Perry class operators will do this
                                      someday.</p>
              <p>Unclear if Aegis ships can do this with SM-2.</p>
              <p>In simple terms, the Perry class is a pre-Aegis ship with separate weapon direction radars like STIR. The system was removed from US ships to save costs when Aegis became more common. Only non-US Perry classes still have it.</p>

              <p>Unfortunately there's little hope. Now the Perry's are pure point blank anti-sub frigates. The AB destroyers are more anti-air than anit ship. Only the Tico cruisers are all-rounders but accroding to wikipedia--and it is prob accurately, the US will cancel the cruiser and stick with the AB destroyers. So the future US Navy is hardly Harpoon capable, mostly concern with Standard missiles and AB threats. Ship to ship battle wise, they won't win.</p>
