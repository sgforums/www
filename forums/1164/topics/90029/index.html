            <div class='col-md body'>China keeps bragging about what they have developed without considering that even though they are improving, the US is also improving. So while CHina might have come up with something new in their arsenal, you can count on the US to also have something up their sleeves.

            <div class='col-md body'>that is a tricky qns.....it really depends on where the US carrier is and how many there are and how many ships defending it<br>Currently with the US ready to commit up to 7 carriers to the area.....it'd be tough.China has a delicate balance to strike....between having to hit US forces......Taiwan forces and leaving enough at home to defend itself.<br>While China has over 2000 planes i do not see it being able to spare more then 1,200 for taiwan.....and it is known that China plans to send 800,000 troops in an invasion.....the chinese army numbers either 1.2million or 2.2 million i'm not too sure(forget lah) but they are downsizing to put more effort into technology.And the bigger the missiles.....the bigger targets they are......so easier to shoot down.<br>The main threat for a CVBG has and always will be submarines.At present the Chinese sub force is quite average......so they shldnt trouble the US ASW yet.....</div>

PAC-II are only available in 4(s) in the launcher .<br><br>in short, PAC III , has its own radar.. explodes by hitting directly against enemy missiles , and it is more expensive..it is available in 16(s) in a launcher<br>and it is better..travels at Mach 5 and requires exact computer precision power<br><br>Taiwan is currently deploying the Patriot missile batteries..<br>and it is touted as one of the most advanced anti-air defenses<br><br>and it is also computer controlled and computer does the shooting,<br>last year..computer problems caused a friendly kill of a british tornado by a patriot.<br><br>China has not made any significant progress or any R&amp;D with regards to anti missile missile..<br><br>China : whats the point of developing a technology which your enemy can counter? missiles ..and anti missiles..haiz ..<br><br>USA : i bet that china will Lose..<br><br>Sun Zi said once that motivation is very important...for taiwanese<br>its for thier right to vote and for democracy..and their right to live<br>alot of taiwanese ive met on the internet says they want freedom and no tight control...communism to them is like putting them in a jail<br><br>whereelse CN's troops motivation would be controlling another province<br>and subjecting it to communism politics..and absorbing pple's economy and military..and gaining access to the pacific..and even out american's presense..in the pacific..<br><br>If TW kana taken over..and even if US doesn't help out..<br>i can still foresee a war..coz USA 's submarines and 7th fleet always train on pacific one..last time heard of the USA submarine accidentally bang japanese trawler??<br><br>thier ships and subs go all around the pacific..definitely more confrontations<br>and if CN lose..also bad..coz America might occupy China..<br>China..might become dong ya bing fu again..feel sad for them if they decides to fight before 2008 =)<br><br>Anyway what makes them think that 1970+ Soviet upgraded technology gonna win the raptor..??Even the 1st generation air superiority fighter<br>F-15 has 100% superiority over enemy and 0 combat losses..<br>despite so many confrontations between F-15 and soviet warplanes..<br><br>F-22 is touted as the plane...much tougher den F-15..The only option to eliminate CBGs in 1 group is nuclear strike , which can give a 10 mile destruction radius..but if ur nuclear missile by that time cfm kana shot down =D<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Goliath was defeated by David 'cos he was too cocky &amp; laughed at the tiny David. China has been damn arrogant of late. Their govt has been boasting about their "military might" and the ability to overrun Taiwan within days. Those of you with cable TV will notice a Chinese documentary (think its on ch 50 or 52) with this smart alec grey-haired guy with specs talking about military stuff. There's another wanker who seems to think China's military is invincible from the way he talks.<br><br>Yes, China's military is impressive. But whether it can defeat the US is another story. And even IF it can defeat the US &amp; it does succeed in invading Taiwan, so wat?<br><br>I'm not gonna repeat in full what I said in a previous thread, but the fact is that if China invades Taiwan, its gonna get slapped with sanctions left &amp; right. Its gonna ostracise itself from the international community. And its booming economy is gonna be reduced to crap due to sanctions &amp; all. If the Chinese leaders are prepared to risk all of that &amp; sacrifice what they have achieved so far, then I say they are too shortsighted.<br><br>Its pretty obvious that every Chinese leader wants to have the distinction of being the one to reunite China. Imagine, his name will be carved in history. As president, Deng Xiaoping tried but failed. As president, Jiang Zemin tried but also failed. And now that he's the chairman of the central military commission, he's trying again. And that's why he's pushing for war &amp; even said it will happen in 2006.<br><br>Often it is man's selfish ambitions that result in tragedy.  In this case, its the Chinese leader's haste to reunite China &amp; have his name carved in history that might result in tragedy. If they just maintain the status quo &amp; stick to dialogue, there will be no war. But of course China will not just sit there 'cos that means their leaders will fail to reunite China &amp; they will not get their names printed in history books as the great one who reunited China.<br><br></div>

Those of you with cable TV will notice a Chinese documentary (think its on ch 50 or 52) with this smart alec grey-haired guy with specs talking about military stuff. There's another wanker who seems to think China's military is invincible from the way he talks.<br><br>Yes, China's military is impressive. But whether it can defeat the US is another story. And even IF it can defeat the US &amp; it does succeed in invading Taiwan, so wat?<br><br>I'm not gonna repeat in full what I said in a previous thread, but the fact is that if China invades Taiwan, its gonna get slapped with sanctions left &amp; right. Its gonna ostracise itself from the international community. And its booming economy is gonna be reduced to crap due to sanctions &amp; all. If the Chinese leaders are prepared to risk all of that &amp; sacrifice what they have achieved so far, then I say they are too shortsighted.<br><br>Its pretty obvious that every Chinese leader wants to have the distinction of being the one to reunite China. Imagine, his name will be carved in history. As president, Deng Xiaoping tried but failed. As president, Jiang Zemin tried but also failed. And now that he's the chairman of the central military commission, he's trying again. And that's why he's pushing for war &amp; even said it will happen in 2006.<br><br>Often it is man's selfish ambitions that result in tragedy.  In this case, its the Chinese leader's haste to reunite China &amp; have his name carved in history that might result in tragedy. If they just maintain the status quo &amp; stick to dialogue, there will be no war. But of course China will not just sit there 'cos that means their leaders will fail to reunite China &amp; they will not get their names printed in history books as the great one who reunited China.<br><br></div></blockquote>It is not only about earning the distinction of being responsible in reuniting China but also the fear of being the China's "Qian Gu Zui Ren" who failed to stop Taiwan's separation from China.<br><br>Any leader who failed to stop Taiwan's independence will be deem as unfit to rule China by their people.<br><br>Do not underestimate China's determination.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>The greatest irony is China's "determination" as you call it, could very well end up being the cause of their downfall.  Believe you me, an all out war against Taiwan &amp; the US will DEFINITELY have severe repercussions against China especially if China was the one who casts the first stone.<br><br>For all his strong words, I feel that Chen Shuibian is nothing more than a hot air blower. I seriously doubt he would declare independance. He's more like a forumer who posts flame baits on forums &amp; China is like the forumer who laps it all up, gets their knickers in a tangle &amp; comes out threatening to unleash hell.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"></div>

I have SCV (Singapore Cable Vision) at home. I would like to watch the show. When and what time the documentary is aired. Do you know where can i direct download the entire Chinese documentary. Thanks! Your help greatly appreciated!<br><br>I don't know to you may be you think China is arrogant and like to boast. But to Mainland Chinese they think their country is being bullied. And that China is being too humble and tolerant. The Taiwanese military to them is a joke from the soldier to equipment. They are very confident that they will win the win.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I think that will also depend greatly on strategy use by both side and the state of alertness. Just take Pearl Harbor for an example. American have more ships(unless you are counting the ship that are in state of operation, i take it as on ship on mission), better equipment(even radar) and even better intelligence, yet they are still caught with their pants down...<br><br>I think the two general strategy used by Chinese will either be the submarine attack or the missle attack(there might be others)... All this attacks will rely on surprise to have devastating effect on the Americans fleet... With the current American survelliance and detection ability, it might be hard to pull this off... But there is still plenty of examples in the world this can be done if it is well coordinated and planned, while the other is in state of low readiness...<br><br>Of course defeat might not mean sinking the ship( i suppose). Disabling or sidelinning them could be useful too.... Then this will probably need some more subtle option like political means</div>
