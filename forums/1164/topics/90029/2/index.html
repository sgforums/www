I tell you, for all they blame Japan about the atrocities committed during WW2, it is not inconceivable that one day China could follow the exact same footpath of Japan.<br><br>And personally, most of all, I detest their BOASTING. I mean, everybody knows that its a rising power, but it ain't no superpower yet, unlike a hyperpower like the US. So if they'll just quit trying to remind us (and the world) every chance they get that they are a superpower, maybe i'll like them a wee bit better.</div>

I dare say that 9 out of 10 of their materials spew this kind of shit. This is just an example of their skewed views. It is broadly so for every kind of article they have there, not only for military stuff. I feel that they are deeply insecure, they have to glorify every small achievement as 'meeting world standards' or something like that.<br><br>As for admonishing America for sitting on their ass, its always like that for them. They are damned if they do, and damned if they dont. Dont you think its really unfair for them? I mean, seriously, its easy to criticise them, and yes, their actions does warrant criticism in many instances, but if you 1) take into account the fact that no country does things without first considering its interests at stake, 2) That it's an inherently 'incoherent' country due to its political system where presidents change at a fast rate, 3) while it does not always carry out the values it preaches, at least it tries to adhere to it in the broad sense, and it <span style="font-style: italic;">at least</span> has those values, then America is a pretty damned good country.<br><br>Take for example, the recent torture cases in Abu Gharaib. While many countries condemned America and pointed it out as a perfect example of American hypocrisy, I see it as the perfect example of why America should be the Superpower instead of any other country. While it was Americans who conducted such outrages on the prisoners, remember that it was also an AMERICAN who blew the whistle on the abuses, due to his sense of values. And remember that the American people condemned the episode as harshly as anybody else. This is what makes them great. And the Arabs who condemned the torture? They do it themselves, hidden from the view of the world.<br><br>But I digress. All in all, I just wanna say that I'd rather America retains its position as the pre-eminent power. For all its flaws, its a very benign power, considering the power that it wields. I shudder at the thought of China possessing such power. They will not be able to handle it responsibly, judging from their past and current behavior and attitudes.</div>

But to Mainland Chinese they think their country is being bullied. And that China is being too humble and tolerant. The Taiwanese military to them is a joke from the soldier to equipment. They are very confident that they will win the win.</div></blockquote><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by YourFather:</div><div class="quote_body">Now, China is stirring up the nationalistic feelings of its people. You shpuld look at them, they are blinded by it. I went to China the last time and got my hands on a few of their military journals. They were a total joke, talking as if the JSF and the Raptor could be defeated by their J-10s without much effort, and saying how their invincible combination of J-10s and SU-30MKKs will rip the ROKAF and USN to shreds. Yeah, right, as if they are not trying desperately to get their grubby fingers on the F-22's blueprints right now so that they can do what they do best - reverse engineering other people's work...<br></div></blockquote>Wah! You can read Chinese Military Journals. Your Chinese must be really very good to be able to understand the content. Thats weird! I thought Mainland Chinese are known to be very humble.<br><blockquote><strong><br>Combine the feeling that the world owes them something and their Nationalism, and you have a very dangerous concoction. Look at them now. They seem to be on a land grabbing spree. They want the Spratlys, they want the Himalayas, they got Tibet, they want Taiwan, they are now thinking that part of Korea was once theirs.... I tell you, for all they blame Japan about the atrocities committed during WW2, it is not inconceivable that one day China could follow the exact same footpath of Japan.<br></strong></blockquote>Do you and the posters here seriously think China is going to stop at Taiwan? If China manage to annex Taiwan. Will China stop? There is still Mongolia (Outer Mongolia). Lots of Chinese posters in Chinese Military Forum think Mongolia should be part of China. Mongolia is an independent country but Mongolia used to be part of China. They feel that it was the Russian who force China to recognise Mongolia independent.<br><blockquote><strong><br>they are now thinking that part of Korea was once theirs.<br></strong></blockquote>I don't think its part of Korea but rather the entire Korea. Both North and South.<br><br>You miss out Vietnam. I heard from them that Vietnam used to belong to China.</div>

If he's wrong, all that shows is that he didn't do his research properly. That doesn't say anything about his IQ whatsoever. There is no need to get into insults here, just point out where you think he is wrong will do. Your statement does say a few things about you though.   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_sad.gif" alt="Sad" title="Sad"></div>
