One soldier with one RPG round can kill 10 Israelis riding in a M113. The numbers just weren't right. Something had to be done about APCs to make sure they do the job they were supposed to do in the first place - protecting infantry.<br><br>On the reverse, most of the MBTs could survive a hit. More than 60% of MBT's hit were able to be repaired and brought back into service. In total more than half the tanks crews survived in MBT's that were hit.<br><br>All these theory about being small, light and fast to avoid being hit is just...theory.<br><br>A tank can only be so small, and a tank can never outrun a RPG round especially in a tight urabn area.<br><br>That is why today, the IDF armour is unique in that they have no light tanks in their inventory. The lightest tank they have is the M113 and they are trying all kinds of innovative ways to uparmour it.</div>
