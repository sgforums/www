            <div class='col-md body'>France was a colonial power, and like most colonial powers, it was prudent to have a mercenary (or expeditionary) force that is prepared to fight in the far flung corners of the empire with no questions asked.<br><br>The Legion is such a force. The Legionnaire is different from the citizen soldier or even the career soldier in that he needs only a salary - not morals or reasons - to fight.<br><br>The British have them - the most famous being the Gurkhas. Another colonial power - Spain - still have a force called the Spanish Legion, which is the equivalent of the FFL (though it no longer accepts criminals or foreigners).<br><br>The original Legionnaire is typically someone who is considered a good-for-nothing or a layabout rounded up from country taverns and pressed into service. Or someone who seeks out these kinds of employment and is accepted with no questions asked either way.<br><br>The Legionnaire fights harder cos he has nothing to lose, no one to miss and has nothing back home to look forward to. Escape from the Legion is usually firing squad offence and most serve till they are discharged or contract ends.<br><br>American troops in the World Wars were mainly citizens. Citizens fight well when their country are threatened. But after the war they expect to go home and carry on with their lives.<br><br>The next up is the career soldier, a citizen deciding to earn a living as a soldier. The US troops now in Iraq are career soldiers. But career soldiers still need a reason to fight, and when things get unpopular they will still make a lot of noise.<br><br>The Legionnaire, on the other hand, will not complain. They made up the great bulk of the French troops sent to fight in all of the nasty wars in former colonies in Africa and Asia where  casualties among regular French troops will raise havoc as these people have families etc.<br><br>Therefore, the Legion continues to accept men of dubious background as to die without reason or regret is expected of them.</div>
