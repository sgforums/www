              <p>Actually I shoot pretty well with the basic SAR-21, but you are not adressing the point, and the point is not my range abilities (which are okay), but the fact that comparable firearms have sights that are far more advanced and afford more options and advantages to the user.</p>
              <p>But it's not surprising, given your basic logic is:</p>
              <p>1) Any small point that is good about the SAR-21, blow it up out of it's actual utility in reason and logic.</p>
              <p>2)When anybody raises a negative point about the SAR-21 (ie. it's primitive scope), dismiss them as weak soldiers who cannot fight with it.</p>
              <p>In fact, lets do the math. The average shooter, using a previous generation M16 with ACOG on P-rail will get better MOAs and pks on the target at range then he or she can on the SAR-21 basic.</p>
              <p>Futher more, the low light performance of the ACOG due to it's fiber optics exceeds that of the SAR-21, which basically becomes useless at night and making the soldier rely on his very untactical LAD for night fighting.</p>
              <p>The advantages of the LAD is that it allows us to take shots without have to get a butt-wield and sight picture, this allows us to take shots from positions previously impossible... however, to rely soley on the LAD (in visible light no less) for night fighting is a very weak point of the SAR-21 basic, given using it raises up it's own disadvantages.</p>

              <p>I am addressing the point ! I am just being fair.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>If you say you can shoot pretty well with a basic SAR-21 - that the point - it does perform well as a basic infantry rifle as what it is design for - cheap and good  = Yes.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>You say compare to other comparable firearms - their sights is more advance ? Are you comparing the basic version of them to SAR-21 or the add-on versions ? if you want add on version then take the p-rail version of SAR-21 to compare.  M16 with p-rail with ACOG is not the plain version !!!</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>You yourself have prove that with primitive scope you shoot well. Not every army is like US army - which afford p-rails, most of them just take the basic version.</p>

              <p>I say replace SAR21 scopes with optics like ACOGs for all front line combat units.  If you were on the front line, wud'nt you want this ability to drop the enemy most of the time ?   For the cost of one F15SG , you can equip the whole Singapore army with ACOGs or similar.  </p>

              <p>If you say you can shoot pretty well with a basic SAR-21 - that the point - it does perform well as a basic infantry rifle as what it is design for - cheap and good  = Yes.</p>
              </blockquote>
              <p> Nobody said that the SAR-21 can't peform well as a basic infantry rifle, we are just pointing out from our experience with it that it leaves much to be desired, and certainly does not deserve much of the bragging rights that ST tries to claim for it.</p>
              <p>In any case, I'll still take it any day over the M-16S1, but I'll dump the basic SAR-21 anyday for an advanced variant of it.</p>
              <blockquote>
              <p>You say compare to other comparable firearms - their sights is more advance ? Are you comparing the basic version of them to SAR-21 or the add-on versions ? if you want add on version then take the p-rail version of SAR-21 to compare.  M16 with p-rail with ACOG is not the plain version !!!</p>
              </blockquote>
              <p>The point is then, why is the SAF not using that variant? Hmmm. It's certainly not because they don't have the means.</p>
              <p>I have no argument with the MMS or P-Rail SAR, or even the LW Carbine which comes with better sights, the problem seems to be that you can't seem to accept the fact that the SAF is not making full use of the SAR-21 and trying to argue instead that what we have now is the best that it can be.</p>
              <p>And don't try to dodge your old arguments, in the Tavor thread you argued yourself blue (and lost badly) trying to argue that the basic SAR-21 sighting solution was superior to MMS systems like P-rail. I remember you ran through a lot of bizzare arguments like "those who cannot shoot with 1.5X are weak", or that "1.5x is more reliable then modular systems" and what have you not.</p>
              <blockquote>
              <p>You yourself have prove that with primitive scope you shoot well. Not every army is like US army - which afford p-rails, most of them just take the basic version.</p>
              </blockquote>
              <p>How much of our GDP do we spend on defence?</p>
              <p>Are you telling me that we can sell better versions of the SAR to other users who actually spend LESS then our nation on the military but can't afford to equip our own troops with it?</p>
              <p>The basic thing I see, is not that the SAF is short of cash or anything, but simply because it's a big case of wayang to me. Nobody want's to rock the boat to make any huge improvements to the basic SAR the SAF grunt gets because nobody is really going to make a lot of money for ST from doing that as well the SAF being too lazy to implement something like retraining and retooling to get our grunts to shoot with better stuff.</p>
              <p>But in the meantime, the SAF grunt is using a weapon that is becoming slowly outdated in the modern arms market. He is limited to using a 1.5x scope that has no proper night fighting abilities leaving him to rely on a very untactical LAD to achieve that end.</p>

              <p>It's probably the US marines who do that, given their marksmanship requirements are a lot stricter.</p>

              <p><br>I will suggest that it is better not to spend the kind of money for the fancy EOtech or Aimpoint etc sights.They will be better off going for the tritium reticles on the baseline 1.5x sight and perhaps also include the bullet compensator as seen in the ACOG for better accuracy at longer distance.</p>
              <p>Upgrading the 1.5x sights with tritium reticles and the compensator will be a cheaper and effective option as compare to getting new sights COTS while at the same time having the need to through the trouble of changing our weapon mainstay to a new variant with the rails and also to include a new logistic chain for our boys just for that new sight.</p>

              <p><br>Pretty much my wishlist if the SAF is somehow too cheap to do this despite being able to buy several F-15SGs and our neighbours like Thailand being able to implement this on the SAR-21s we sell them..</p>
              <p>But in any case the basic sights as they are now leave MUCH to be desired.</p>
