            <div class='col-md body'><strong>S'pore Navy unveils new firepower to fight terror at sea</strong><br><br>Featured in joint exercise with US Navy, anti-missile missiles and quick-firing guns boost ability to tackle fast-boat threats<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">By David Boey </span><br><br>THE Republic of Singapore Navy (RSN) will unveil new capabilities for destroying fast-moving boats at a joint exercise with the United States Navy.<br><br>These will include Barak anti-missile missiles and a remote-control weapon system called Typhoon, which mounts a quick-firing 25mm Bush-master gun.<br><br>The RSN said yesterday these capabilities boost its firepower against threats from small boats in 'unconventional war situations'. Such situations may involve fast boats steered by terrorists on suicide missions.<br><br>The live firings will take place during an 11-day maritime warfare exercise between the RSN and US Navy called Carat, which stands for Cooperation Afloat Readiness And Training. The exercise was launched yesterday at Changi Naval Base.<br><br>Another highlight of the manoeuvres is the use of a US Navy command, control and communications system aboard an RSN warship.<br><br>US Navy Rear-Admiral Kevin Quinn, Commander Logistics Group Western Pacific, said yesterday this ensures naval commanders can communicate securely, and view a common picture of the battle scenario.<br><br>'In a real world contingency, this capability would make a difference between success and failure,' said Rear-Adm Quinn.<br><br>Colonel James Soon, RSN Fleet Commander, said the navy's Barak anti-missile missile will be used for the first time against a simulated ship target.<br><br>The RSN's six missile corvettes, a missile-armed warship class, were each armed with 16 Barak anti-missile missiles in 1996. The ships also carry eight Harpoon anti-ship missiles.<br><br>The 2.2m-long Barak anti-missile missiles have a range of 10km and can travel at more than twice the speed of sound. They were designed to destroy enemy missiles and aircraft but were recently adapted for use against ships as well.<br><br>Of the Typhoon weapon system, Col Soon said: 'We are quite sure this weapon will provide greater effectiveness to our ships against small boat threats at sea.'<br><br>Now in its 10th year, the annual Carat exercise has grown in scope, complexity and scale. This year's manoeuvres will involve some 1,500 personnel from the Singapore Armed Forces, US Navy and US Coast Guard.<br><br>The war games will involve 12 warships, a submarine, helicopters and maritime patrol aircraft.<br><br><a href="http://straitstimes.asia1.com.sg/singapore/story/0,4386,254077,00.html?" rel="nofollow">http://straitstimes.asia1.com.sg/singapore/story/0,4386,254077,00.html?</a></div>

The high speed, fixed output rocket motors of the anti-missile, coupled with sensitive guidance control actuators, would over-react to such miniscule course changes in the target (when it is not an oncoming missile).

James Soon, the Republic of Singapore NavyÂ’s (RSN) fleet commander. Soon addressed a crowd of more than 100 U.S. and RSN sailors and officers in the baseÂ’s fleet command building auditorium during the opening ceremony.<br><br>Â“Friendship ties now are investments for future generations of leaders and an important fabric of military and even international diplomacy,Â” said Soon.<br><br>During CARAT Singapore, more than 1,500 personnel from the U.S. Navy, U.S. Coast Guard and the Singapore Armed Forces, along with 12 ships and a variety of aircraft, will take part in an assortment of exercise events ranging from at-sea gun and missile shoots to in-port force protection drills.<br><br>Â“The Singapore phase of CARAT was the very first in the history of the exercise series, and I think it is fitting that in this year, the 10th, the Singapore phase is again the initial phase for our CARAT task group,Â” said Rear Adm. Kevin Quinn, commander of Task Force 712 and the U.S. NavyÂ’s executive agent for CARAT. Â“Technology and our mutual commitment to developing our navy-to-navy relationship have brought us very, very far.Â”<br><br>This yearÂ’s exercise includes a number of firsts that Quinn said, Â“Â…when viewed in the aggregate, paint a telling picture of just how much CARAT Singapore has matured.Â”<br><br>Â“Planning staff from both navies will share operational and tactical information in a seamless manner for the first time,Â” Soon said. Â“I know that this effort will act as the springboard for further integration of information between the United States Navy and the Republic of Singapore Navy. It is a necessary ingredient for close collaboration especially in the current maritime security environment.Â”<br><br>The first time deployment of the mobile command, control, communications, computer and intelligence (C4I) system PAC3T in an RSN ship will allow this information exchange and sharing of a Â“common operational picture,Â” when a combined USN/RSN command staff leads the underway portion of the exercise from RSS Resolution - also a CARAT first. Additionally, the installation and use of the Combined Enterprise Regional Information Exchange (CENTRIX) system in Resolution will provide USN and RSN ships email and "chat" communications capabilities. This will be the first use of CENTRIX during CARAT.<br><br>Â“These two systems will increase the headquarters staffÂ’s situational awareness and our mutual interoperability,Â” Quinn said. Â“In a real world contingency, this capability could make a difference between success and failure. And in 1995, this capability would have been only a dream.Â”<br><br>Capt. Buzz Little, commander, Destroyer Squadron 1 and the CARAT Task Group, along with his staff, will embark Resolution and work side-by-side with his RSN counterpart, Col. Ng Chee Peng, commander of the RSNÂ’s 1st Flotilla and its CARAT task group during the exercise. Â“This is a ground breaking development,Â” Quinn said.<br><br>Leaders recognized other new initiatives, including the inclusion of the Arleigh Burke-class guided-missile destroyers USS Russell (DDG 59) and USS McCampbell (DDG 85).<br><br>Â“The DDGs are a CARAT first, and their participation symbolizes the U.S. NavyÂ’s commitment to this exercise, Singapore and this region of the world,Â” Quinn added.<br><br>Besides Singapore, CARAT participants this year include Thailand, Brunei, Malaysia and the Philippines.<br><br>While each country phase differs based on the desires of CARAT partners, the general focus is on interoperability of sea services in areas such as operational planning, command and control, tactics, logistics support and maritime law. A variety of seminars in areas ranging from damage control to public affairs are also scheduled, as are community service projects and social events that provide exercise participants a chance to develop personal relationships so critical to combined operations.<br><br>Â“You will find that these personal relationships you develop will be the great facilitator when we operate as a team. So I encourage each of you to make the most of these opportunities to get to know one another. You will find that we are all far more similar than different,Â” Quinn said.<br><br>The U.S. CARAT Task Group, under the leadership of Little, is made up of U.S. Coast Guard high endurance cutter Mellon (WHEC 717), dock landing ship USS Fort McHenry (LSD 43), guided-missile destroyers USS Russell (DDG 59) and USS McCampbell (DDG 85), and rescue and salvage ship USS Salvor (ARS 52). Other elements, including P-3C Orion and SH-60 Seahawk aircraft, are also taking part in the Singapore phase of CARAT.<br><br>Little's staff is based in San Diego, as is McCampbell. The cutter Mellon is homeported in Seattle. Russell and Salvor are homeported in Pearl Harbor, Hawaii. Fort McHenry is part of the U.S. 7th Fleet's forward deployed naval force operating from Sasebo, Japan.<br><br>For more information on CARAT, visit www.clwp.navy.mil/carat2004.<br><br><img src="http://www.news.navy.mil/management/photodb/webphoto/web_040527-N-4104L-006.jpg"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>SINGAPORE (NNS) -- The Republic of Singapore NavyÂ’s (RSN) RSS Resolution (LST 208 ) was home to a first-time combined RSN-U.S. Navy (USN) command staff during the at-sea phase of exercise Cooperation Afloat Readiness and Training (CARAT) in the South China Sea June 6-9.<br><br>In the ultimate test of interoperability, Capt. Buzz Little, commander of Destroyer Squadron 1 and the U.S. CARAT Task Group, along with members of his staff and enlisted telecommunications specialists, embarked Resolution for three days to work side-by-side with his RSN counterpart, Col. Ng Chee Peng, commander of the RSNÂ’s 1st Flotilla and its CARAT task group during the exercise.<br><br>Â“I was honored to have the opportunity to work together with Col. Ng Chee Peng aboard the RSS Resolution," said Little. "Our staffs demonstrated the highest level of professionalism and mutual respect for one another. The combined command was a success on many levels and has laid the groundwork for future exercise opportunities during CARAT Singapore."<br><br>To communicate with other ships in the CARAT Task Group, the combined staff had at their fingertips two real-time computer systems, the Combined Enterprise Regional Information Exchange system (CENTRIX), and the Portable Allied Command, Control, Communications Terminal (PAC3T). The systems were installed in Resolution prior to getting under way, and were intended to give USN and RSN ships secure communications capabilities while sharing a common operational picture of ship locations. This was the first time CENTRIX was used during CARAT and the first time the PAC3T system was installed in a CARAT ship.<br><br>Â“When CENTRIX was up and operating, it was fantastic because it was our lifeline to the USN ships,Â” said Lt. Kevin Borden, Destroyer Squadron 1Â’s combat systems officer, who was embarked in Resolution.<br><br>CENTRIX allowed the U.S. ships to electronically chat with the combined staff aboard Resolution, a method of communication that is common these days in the U.S. Navy. In this first use of CENTRIX during CARAT, the system shared an existing Resolution antenna that was also used for other shipboard business.<br><br>Â“If we wouldÂ’ve had our own antenna, we wouldÂ’ve had constant contact,Â” Borden said, when discussing the technical success of the initiative, along with the first time challenges.<br><br>Â“ItÂ’s rare to do cryptological training with another nationÂ’s Navy. We have very similar capabilities, but our systems are generally not compatible,Â” said Information Systems Technician (IT) 1st Class Timothy Hess, a local area network administrator from USS Fort McHenry (LSD 43). Hess, along with ITs from Logistics Group Western Pacific in Singapore, embarked with the U.S. staff to set up and operate the CENTRIX and PAC3T systems. PAC3T includes a monitor display with maps that allows for the visual tracking of assets, such as ships.<br><br>When issues arose with CENTRIX or PAC3T, the ITs, along with their RSN counterparts were able to find solutions together.<br><br>Â“We were able to troubleshoot issues as a team. It was an excellent training opportunity to let them get on CENTRIX so they could see the advantages of having real-time chat with other navies for tracking and plotting,Â” Hess added.<br><br>During the under way phase of the exercise, the combined task group took part in a variety of operational events, including a missile exercise against a surface target by the RSN, and a combined gun and missile shoot against an air target, simulated by a BQM-74E drone launched from USS McCampbell (DDG 85). Other at-sea events included air defense, close air support, surface action group and tactical free play exercises.<br><br>While cutting-edge technologies and operations were the focal point for U.S. and Singaporean combined operations, it was the personal interactions, teamwork and exposure to operational and cultural differences that left the greatest impression on U.S. Sailors.<br><br>Â“A lot of the concepts onboard the Resolution were really radical, at least from our perspective," Hess said. Â“For instance, when you went to the mess decks, you served yourself. When you were finished, you washed your own plates and put them back in the cabinet you pulled them from. That meant not a lot of wasted food, and they didnÂ’t have to have food service attendants because they policed themselves.Â”<br><br>With only 65 officers and crew aboard the largest class of ship in the Republic of Singapore Navy, the camaraderie and pride was evident in the crew's attitudes.<br><br>Â“There was a lot of camaraderie between the crew and the commanding officer. It seemed as if the commanding officer only had to breathe an idea and the crew was on it,Â” said Operations Specialist 1st Class Andrew Craft.<br><br>Craft embarked Resolution from Fort McHenry and added that it seemed the U.S. contingent built camaraderie with their counterparts. Â“They were really eager to help us out and work alongside,Â” he said.<br><br>The Singaporean navy counterparts agreed that the joint command exercise was a success on a personal and professional level.<br><br>Â“This has been an incredible exercise and experience,Â” said Col. Sim Tiong Kian. Â“There was very close cooperation between the ships of both navies in the planning phase ashore and execution at sea, as well as amongst members of the joint afloat Exercise Planning and Control Team in managing the battle rhythm. Through extensive interaction between exercise participants at the professional and social level of interoperability and mutual understanding was achieved, which puts both navies in good stead for further collaboration in future exercises and operations.Â”<br><br>The CARAT Task Group, under the leadership of Little, is made up of the U.S. Coast Guard high endurance cutter Mellon (WHEC 717), the dock landing ship USS Fort McHenry (LSD 43), the guided-missile destroyers USS Russell (DDG 59) and USS McCampbell (DDG 85), and the rescue and salvage ship USS Salvor (ARS 52).</div>
