            <div class='col-md body'>i think in that incident i am talking about, we are at something above defcon 1..........i think lah.....<br><br>ok, it is like this, during that particular malaysia election, one chinese politician won a seat, so naturally his supporters will rally for him........then in the middle of the rally, malays appeared and start hacking and slashing......this mark the start of one of the first chinese purge......as the malaysia Gov don;t give a sh it bout it and bo chap let them kill, singapore citizen and PR with reletives in malaysia are very angry and worried, so they ask sg gov for help, then i wonder which gundo(or genius) think of a idea, and send a msg to all malaysia chinese to tell them to fall back to JB, where SAF will then break into JB, establish base there, and distrubute service rifles among chineses.......brilliant plan i must say, and it would have work with UN too.........but which every *** PM of malaysia then knows things is bloody wrong by that time and order all purging stop, by force if neccearry..........it was rumoured that because of this incident, malaysia's relation with singapore droped like siao and since then never return to the original point........<br><br>somebody can confirm this???</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>The only time I remember SAF went to Defcon 3 was during the Israeli President visit. Lot's of ppl didn't go home for a couple of weeks and LIVE ammo (not just bullets mind you) was drawn out to the field.<br><br>I think some squadrons was armed and on alert in all the airbase ammo pens was loaded with live bombs and missiles. Very tiring time for the RSAF armourers. Rumor was one died when a missile collapse on him.<br><br>Ya it was an interesting 2-3 weeks. Don't know about the 1998 incident though.</div>

Then you risk breaking up ASEAN. Regional countries will start to take sides. Then you risk being labeled as West vs. Muslim worlds.<br><br>ASEAN solution is better as a lot of status quo can be maintained.</div>
