They also close down SIR to prevent pple from running and they forcingly recruit students from universities and vocational institutes to join the army. Those refused were quietly hanged in Changi Prison. The army is so weak till the government have to seek the para-military forces for manpower aid and Airlines pilots were transferred without advance warning to airforce units. Those pilots refused joined the fate of those students , either be sent to fighting ground units or terminated.<br><br>LOLx , u do not have faith on ur country yeah?<br><br>wat do u think ....?

A few years of NCC foot drills, some shooting...does not qualify one as a soldier. I would trust a over 40+  NSman who had completed his 13 yr cycle with a M16, than a NCC. You can't just take a NCC and throw him into some unit, and expect him to learn on the spot. He will be more of a libility, than an asset. Combat ready is not being about able to wear camo, and shoot a bloody rifle, but much more.<br><br>Also, I remember some Geneva Convenction that under 16 are not allowed to be drafted ...or something like that. Also the lawsuits, screams and outburst from the parents! <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br><br>Aiya, don't worry lar, when the time comes, there will be enough NSman to defend this little red dot.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"><br><br>Juz some advice, don't believe everything you read in "Defending the lion city"  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>
