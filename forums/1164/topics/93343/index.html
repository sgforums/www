Everyone has a right to express opinion..<br><br>9. To the mods, thank you for bearing with me LOL!<br><br>10. I don't really care what my sgforums or Gempur-wira haters say<br><br>--------------------------MY Cock "WORDS"-------------------------------------<br><br>MOST OF MY POSTS here, are meant to scare our "potential" enemies<br>with suggestions of nuclear bombs, and ridiculous ideas of blitkrieg and<br>usage of napalm , vx gas and the ability to use DSO and DSTA<br>to research for chemical or biological weapons or suggestions like<br>going through vietnamnese, of course how can we deny the fact that<br>we can easily get a nuclear bomb from ABC?? After all , ABC is our<br>very good friend.<br><br>Of course israel has over 200 nuclear warheads, say if we borrow 10 and<br>purchase one at 50 million USD + another F-15 E at 40 million USD and<br>say we put on stealthy features like black paint over it and use noise<br>reduction engines .<br><br>Do you all know whats the formula here?<br><br>50million+40million USD = Kaboom<br><br>And regarding the Arrow 2 and Green Pine Missile system<br>it has of course *cough* the ability to shoot down your ASTROS<br><br>What im suggesting is a theory of multiple split warhead after the rocket<br>reaches a range or a ceiling , inside implanted with mutiple trackers to home  to each missile<br><br>Israeli arrows can be deployed, i think about 10km before the stuff arrive..<br><br>Of course, i also mentioned about having Mammoth tanks,<br>(sorry if u peed inside your pants when i utter the word "Mammoth")<br><br>It's pretty possible to use it in real life though, ive estimated it be few hundred tons and have about 5,000 horsepower or equivalent<br>to about 10 Ferrari Cars..<br><br>I only scared niah..cause in NCC im quite a good talker<br>and can entertain you all<br><br>Yup and 1 last word before i go, MiG-29<br><br>"MiG-29s have seen limited combat on at least four occasions:<br>(1) Syrian Air Force MiG-29s were the first to see combat, against the F-15s and F-16s of the Israelis during 1990-91 in a number of small air battles over the Golan region and/or southwestern Lebanon. Rumor has it (unconfirmed) that at least one MiG-29 was shot down, probably by an F-15C.<br><br>(2) Iraqi Air Force MiG-29s were, of course, involved in Operation Desert Storm, when 5 of their number were shot down in aerial combat during the first 3 days of the war. A sixth crashed itself during an air-to-air engage- ment against an F-15E strike package (in the process, managing to shoot down its own wingman, a MiG-23 "Flogger," and the only confirmed "kill" by a MiG-29 to date. At least five or six others were destroyed on the ground, and four flew to Iran (including one MiG-29UB "Fulcrum-B."<br><br>(3) Yugoslavian Air Force MiG-29s saw combat as ground-support fighters during the early stages of the war in Croatia and Bosnia. At least one was shot down by ground fire, and the others have all gone to seed in Serbia. None were involved in air-to-air engagements.<br><br>(4) A dozen ex-Moldovan MiG-29s were sold to secessionist rebels in southern Yemen in 1994, and piloted by Moldovan mercenary pilots. One of these was shot down on a ground support mission, and six others were destroyed on the ground when government forces recaptured the Southern capital of Aden. The remaining five are now in storage, and will probably be re-sold.<br><br>Iraq took delivery of its first 18 "Fulcrums" in 1987, the year before the Iran-Iraq War ended, so it's possible that some Iraqi MiG-29s saw limited ser- vice in the war, but given the time necessary to train pilots and ground crew, and make new aircraft operational, it's likely that the war ended before the MiGs saw any serious fighting. Also, by that time, the Iranian Air Force was almost non-operational due to a lack of spares and a conservative use doctrine, and so air-to-air engagements were fleeting and usually not decisive.<br><br>MiG-29s may also have seen limited combat in the Chechnya operation last year in Russia, although it seems that Su-27s and MiG-31s were used in the CAP role, while Su-24s and Su-25s were the main ground attack machines. If any "Fulcrums" saw combat, their numbers were extremely small.<br><br>There are NO confirmed or unconfirmed reports of any MiG-29 kills in any theater of conflict, while at least 6 have been shot down by other fighters.*<br><br>[RAP comment: This has been changed since the moment of this posting. Cuban MiG-29 scored agaist <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Cessna</span> flown by Brothers to Rescue]."<br><br>Cessna remains the only plane downed by MiG-29<br><br>woo hoo Cessna not bad huh! Cessna is a good plane<br>Malaysians should be proud of a Cessna kill !<br><br>Good luck to users of MiG-29!</div>
