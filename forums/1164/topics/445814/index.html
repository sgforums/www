              1) Did you zero your rifle properly? If you never zeroed it, the last user might be a real left or right cross eye and your rounds will head somewhere else.
              
              2) Did you allow for droppage? Bullets travel in an arc, so if you're aiming far away, aim higher a bit. 100m Direct shoot, 200m aim at neck, 300m aim at top of head.
              
              3) Did you use a support to steady your rifle or just your arm? If it's only your arm, you'll suffer from "muscle twitch" that causes your rifle to jerk all over.
              
              Find a support, either a sandbag or the floor and rest the rifle on it, don't let it rest on your arm, then rest your arm on it to lock it in place. If you have to hand stabilize, ground your elbow on something immobile and try not to use it to take the weight directly. (i.e try to use the bone to support instead of muscle).
              
              4) Hold your breath before pulling the trigger. Most I know breath in, I prefer to exhale, gets rid of the sponginess of the air in your chest. Either way works.
              
              5) Repeatable stance. Find a stance you're comfortable with and repeat properly so you'll get predictable shot flight profile. If you zeroed your rifle with butt on your deltoid, then shot with the butt somewhere else the second time, the round won't be landing where your scope said it will.
              
              6) Exercise. lol. Build up your biceps and especially your wrists. Weight training helps. The stronger your muscles there, the less "muscle twitch" that will affect you when you fire from the shoulder. The best marksman I ever saw, drew in his free time. Freehand, arm above the paper, pencil at 90 degrees. Hellishly strong wrist, his rifle didn't twitch much.
              
              BTW... isn't IMT that stupid computer game?

              .... tripwire.. no zeroing means the barrels come out of the factory straight aligned, NOT that the previous user did not calibrate it. After someone has used it, it is definately NOT aligned. You ever been to range before?
                  
              And I can definately say the targets used for both are similar sized. The only major difference is at 300m, you do 2 Figure 11, 1 Figure 12 instead of 3 Figure 11.
                  
              And SAR-21 DOES have a 2 stage trigger, the second stage is where you hear the "click" when you do your shear check. I'm also assuming that you're talking about the part about holding your breath when firing, that's nothing to do with trigger stage, more to do with inhaling and exhaling changes your physical size and hence your stance.

              <p>brother, i am sar-21 and m-16 trainned. i guaranteed you SAR-21 is factory zeroed and you can share the same rifle between different firer without "re-zeroing", my unit last firing we swap rifle like crazy among us... no problem at all.</p>
              <p>there is NO 2 "click" trigger in SAR-21, have you handle a M-16 before?</p>
              <p>and the targets meant for the SAR-21 and M-16 is definitely one size smaller... i know because i have seen both targets side by side... next time you got chance go ask your instructor at the IMT to show you.</p>

              <p>there is NO 2 "click" trigger in SAR-21, have you handle a M-16
              before?</p>
              <p>and the targets meant for the SAR-21 and M-16 is definitely one

              <p>This is missing the point. The rifle's zero comes pre-adjusted from the factory but can be adjusted. If someone has messed with it, it has to be re-zeroed.</p>

              <p>the rifle is factory zeroed, soldiers are not allowed to "zero" the sar-21 assuming even if they can do so in the first place.</p>
              <p>secondly, in order to zero the rifle, you need live rounds to do so... unlike M-16 range, SAR-21 dont have live round zero at the range, so how to "zero"?</p>
              <p>if your rifle is truely zero off... most officer will simply pick up a spare rifle and pass it to you... or ask you take your buddy's SAR-21.</p>

              <p>another thing about aiming the SAR-21 , other then the basics and the cross on the target. make sure you have a complete clear scope view, if any part of the scope (circular) view is slightly "black", it means your eye and the cross are not aiming straight.</p>

              Were you ever in NS?
                      
              You didn't zero the SAR using the Canadian Bull? When I used the NS rifle during reservist ICT, it shot one grouping high. Which means one click down. The adjustments knobs are on the top of the scope for L/R, RHS of the scope for High/Low.
                      
              The Marksmen 3x scope were zeroed using Canadian Bull at 200.
                      
              You tell me there is no "2nd point" for the SAR? Did you ever do a shear check during reassembly before? The 1st point is the point where you start pulling the trigger, the 2nd is at the "click" point for the shear. You want to semi-auto rapid fire on the SAR, you DON'T release the trigger all the way, just past the bite point, then pull again. This is the most obvious proof that there IS a 2 stage trigger.
                  
              "there is NO 2 "click" trigger in SAR-21, have you handle a M-16 before?"
                  
              SAR and M-16, but M-16 only for BMT, then I went to M-4. 
                  
              "and the targets meant for the SAR-21 and M-16 is definitely one size smaller... i know because i have seen both targets side by side... next time you got chance go ask your instructor at the IMT to show you."
                  
              No need. I helped them change the target boards....
              
              If you have never zeroed a SAR, I'm thinking training standards really have dropped.
              
              What was your grouping size in the IMT/ATP?

              <p>The SAR is zero-able, I vaguely remember doing it in my NS days. BUT there's usually no need for it as factory zeroing is good enough for the vast majority. Every year I just pick some random SAR that's probably been manhandled and dropped by countless reservists before and still hit my targets, including those at 300m. </p>
              <p>My unit has never spent anything more than a day in the range (even in high keys), so naturally there was no time spent on zeroing. I have no idea how bad my grouping is, but I guess if I'm hitting them across all the board, it's good enough.</p>
              <p>That's despite wearing spectacles and shooting left handed with a right handed rifle. Finally, I can justify the obscene number of hours spent in arcades shooting criminals and zombies while growing up.</p>
              <p>I guess my point is, there's really no need to zero a SAR if all you're hitting is 100m and nearer in the range. The target goes down whether you hit the head, the side (or even the pebbles in front the target). What's more important is the basic technique, consistency, and a decent spotter in the rare case you need to combat zero.</p>
              <p>Or you can hope the idiot marksman in the next lane keeps hitting your targets.</p>

              <p>I'm kinda late, but to the OP in short :</p>
              <p>1) hold the rifle against your shoulder correctly (ask the instructors how) and consistently (practise).</p>
              <p>2) Exhale slowly and hold the rifle at eye level, then hold your breath, aim, and take the shot. Don't take too long, as your hands might begin to tremble.</p>
              <p>3) Squeeze the trigger steadily. Quick pulls or snapping can throw your aim off without you noticing.</p>
              <p>4) Practise holding a rifle and aiming with it. Since you're in NCC, I guess there's the arcade ... =p</p>

              ATP or BTP?
              
              Well, guess my unit was the kind where we were bloody competitive, my grouping was 8.6 cm diameter at 100m, the next guy I was trying to catch up to was 8.4.
              
              That artist I mentioned? 4-5cm grouping.
              
              Of course you can use the SAR without zeroing, but you'll have to hope the last guy did'nt mess up the windage, and shooting is definately more accurate with something custom calibrated to your eye.
              
              Our fam shoot, I was hitting Fig 15 at 300. Just have to aim at imaginary lower hip level. The round will drop by almost half body length. Couldn't bear to lose to the rest. :)

              <p>The point is, the factory zero slips and becomes useless, and in
                                          the tactical sense you go to war with a personal weapon, not with a
                                          weapon you find in a crate or on the floor like in a video

              <p>Your personal weapon is a weapon you train with and have to go

              <p>And this is not under extremely harsh conditions or torture
                                          testing but routine use.</p>
              <p>So if something like "factory zero" can't last the operational
                                          lifetime of the weapon, what does this say about it except it is a
                                          gimmick? In fact plenty of weapons with intergrated scopes could
                                          claim "factory zero" as a nice feature, and as a matter of fact
                                          these weapons are factory zeroed.</p>
              <p>Bt they don't make a big point about it because they know by
                                          common sense such a thing is a gimmick.</p>

              <p>Getting your facts wrong again?</p>
              <p>Virtually all other modern firearms are factory-zeroed, but once
                                          again they don't make a fuss of it. The SAR-21 is hardly new to
                                          this practice. Your G36 comes off the assembly line zeroed to 200
                                          meters.</p>
              <p>The difference was that the SAR-21 makers were silly enough to
                                          claim this weapon didn't need zeroing due to factory zeroing, which
                                          was patently false. Before ATP there are still zeroing shoots for
                                          the SAR-21.</p>
              <p>This is because factory zero was never a subsitute for true zero
                                          in the first place.</p>

              <li id="post_8256647-row" class="post"><a id="post_8256647" name="post_8256647"></a>Additionally, the whole idea of "factory zero" was not so grunts
                                          could take weapons from the box and shoot with them, but to cut
                                          down on the zeroing time spent in the range.
              <div id="post-body-8256647" class="body">
              <p>This is what the literature says:</p>
              <blockquote>
              <p>The scope is factory-zeroed, and requires minimal further
                                          zeroing to suit different users. This minimizes non-training range
                                          time to zero the weapons and maximises live-firing training
                                          hours</p>
              </blockquote>
              <p>As for combat advantage there is practically none at all... in
                                          fact you'll be probably worse of because the "standard" zero of the
                                          sights will not suit you as perfectly as a weapon that you bothered
                                          to zero on the range to your needs.</p>
              <p>And of course the zero of all weapons, especially new ones which
                                          have not been broken in will slip because the shooting
                                          characteristics of the weapon will change over time as it is
                                          used.</p>
              <p>So what advantage does the factory zero give in practice? Unless
                                          the SAF is in the practice of issuing non-personal weapons to their
                                          troops straight from the box and sending them into battle without
                                          time to prepare and personalize the sights to the users...</p>
              <p>It provides none at all.</p>
              <p>It's about the same as the lionnoisy claimed advantage of being
                                          able to carry the SAR-21 like a handbag and "run for your life"</p>

Perhaps we should have been a bit clearer. Unlike the M-16, the SAR21 comes from the factory ready to be used without the need for zero-ing. However, some units do zero the weapon for greater precision. Once the weapons are undergo this personalised zero-ing, they would need to be zero-ed regularly or when the weapon changes hands.</span>

              <div class="commentActions fsm fwn fcg">anyway..., when my reservist unit first starts to convert to SAR-21, there werent enough to go around... only 20 SAR-21 were made available for every company of men and officer. </div>

              <div class="commentActions fsm fwn fcg">given the fact that there were more men then there were rifle, its pretty obvious we have to share our "wives" and gang rape them massively at the range.
