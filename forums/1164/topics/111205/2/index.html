Viking project originally involves Sweden, Denmark and Norway producing a common submarine design suitable for all 3 countries. Since then, Norway and Denmark had both pulled out leaving only Sweden to go ahead with the project alone. They have not announced the termination of te project yet.<br><br>Denmark has completely phased out their submarine force since the start of 2005. Their submarines are now all retired. Therefore they do not need any more submarines.<br><br>Norway decided against buying any new submarine and instead upgraded their current Ula class to serve their needs.<br><br>Singapore, Poland and Finland are holding observer status in the Viking project only.</div>
