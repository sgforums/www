Hmm.<br><br>The first responders on the scene were not normal RHKP patrolmen, but the EU unit. Just look at the license plate of the van. They were trained, in fact, a cut above the normal patrolman.<br>But they were engaged before they could get within nominal engagement range.<br><br>Add to that, none of the responders had night vision equipment, so they could not possibly have ID'd all the shooters. Even if they could have ID'd the shooters on the ground, what about the one performing overwatch?<br><br>I remind you that the aggressors were all young rich punks, with no formal training, except for a ex-Marine.<br><br>Note the distance they were engaged.

And can a hit be achieved using non-match ammo? That's some pretty serious shooting there, I can't really get a good headshot beyond 100 myself.</div></blockquote>Yes the effective range for M16A1 is 460m. It is just a guide to getting the best effective or shooting within this range with a 5.56 round. The bullet can fly much further, and the still seriously wound or kill someone at even 800m.<br><br>In fact if you know the bullet tractory, there is nothing to stop you from hitting the target at 500m, but usually you will have  go for a body shot rather then like 400m still can go for a head shot as with naked eye, at 500m, the head of target is kind of too small to take chance on.<br><br></div>
