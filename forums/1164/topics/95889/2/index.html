I have never seen a 5.56 penetrate one. Sometimes it just removes the white paint from it. But a 7.62 will punch right through leaving behind a hole of about 1cm diameter.</div>

They have to appear approachable, and not overarm till they intimate the people they are to protect. That is why when police chose weapon, they also have to consider how the weapon look this is not to create panic to the public. Just imagine, police officer bring machine gun just go after a snatch thief, the public will thought they are after Osama instead and all stampade.<br><br>But did you notice a few case of handgun incident in Singapore, once it is confirm that the suspect may be armed with pistol or revovler, the police will mobilise the heavier arm unit which carry Sub-machine guns and rifles.<br><br>Actually accuracy is more important in a automatic weapon like machine guns. It is very different from the movie. In fact with a machine gun, you will find you have limit ammo and a faster firing rate. In real life, it is aimed control burst of 3-5 rounds each shoot is the best way for machine guns<br><br></div>

It is not enough, it can stop up to sub machines rounds only. You need the levelIII at least for 5.56 or 7.62</div>
