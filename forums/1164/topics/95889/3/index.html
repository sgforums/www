It is very different from the movie. In fact with a machine gun, you will find you have limit ammo and a faster firing rate.

The M855, with a steel-penetrator can be tricky.<br><br>There are many types of 7.62 rounds. The ones used by the sniping community will probably require a Level 4 to stop. As again, look at the NIJ chart carefully, you'll see that the rounds are rated with a muzzle velocity.
