He arrived here Thursday after a four-day working visit to Japan.<br><br>Earlier, Najib and his delegation were briefed on and toured the sophisticated support battle ship at the port here.<br><br>Najib, who is also Defence Minister, said besides increasing the ATM's assets, acquiring the ship was also timely in view of the prevailing national defence requirements.<br><br>"It will be very useful in enhancing our capability in humanitarian operations. It can also be turned into a mini hospital equipped with an operation theatre."<br><br>The ship was built by Hanjin Heavy Industries &amp; Construction Co Ltd and is to be commissioned for use by the Korean navy soon.<br><br>It is equipped with the latest radar system and anti-missile weapons and could carry 700 officers and staff, besides helicopters, tanks, artillery, hovercraft and other vehicles.<br><br>Najib said the cost of buying the ship had not been determined as it would also depend on ATM's technical requirements and specifications.<br><br>"If we purchase it, it will be through international tender," he added.<br><br>On his visit to a Samsung Techwin artillery system manufacturing plant which also makes tanks, Najib said the system was highly sophisticated but the government had no plans to purchase it yet.<br><br>"In 2004, the ATM tried out the system.<br><br>"But it is not in the 9MP budget, but we will consider it if it is required," he added.<br><br>-- BERNAMA</blockquote>Cheers,<br>Sunho</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Thier NS is not like our NS. And any move to make it like ours is certain to fail given the system of patronage and corruption which is practiced there. The training costs and outlays are exhorbitant. And it requires a sea-change where efficiency and logistics are concerned. All these will take decades and decades and might even be in the realm of impossible since it also concerns race issues.<br><br>We should not be resting on our laurels though. However, the Iskandar project ought to be taken with a pinch of salt. Like all the other massive projects the Malaysian administration has undertaken and fizzled out. Old problem but same deal. It`s just never the hardware; though sometimes it is  with them too. More importantly, it is the soft systems which are put in place to run the place and run it efficiently and keep it that way. How you change that there is beyond me since it has become a way of life and kept that way persistently generation after generation.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote>at least they gt palm oil.<br><br>wad we got?<br><br>newater?  </blockquote>Good point. If we can market Newater properly, it will plausibly make more money than palm oil could ever make. Given the decreasing supply of fresh water around the world, this is a potential money-maker. Meanwhile, palm oil will just be palm oil. Perhaps weed in infestation in the future.</div>
