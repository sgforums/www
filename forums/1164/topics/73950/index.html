            <div class='col-md body'>Under normal circumstances, a LRRP team's weapons load is barely sufficient for getting away from the enemy if contacted - the rule therefore is to avoid contact.<br><br>As far as I can remember, the last time LRRP teams were used for search-and-destroy missions was in Vietnam.  In the Gulf war, the teams sent out on Scud-hunting missions were not strictly recce teams.  If you read accounts by guys like Peter Radcliffe and Andy McNab, their orders were to destroy the Scuds themselves, and if the target was too large or well-defended, to call in air strikes.  Radcliffe's team inserted with their Pinkies and drove about destroying targets.  Their orders would define them more as strike teams than as recce teams.</div>

Also, interestingly, when TCS aired the Navy drama series starring Desmond Shen and Chen Tianwen (back in the late 80s to early 90s if I remember), I remember in the episode where pirates hijacked a pleasure craft and resulted in response from Naval Diving Unit.  In the ensuing gun battle with the pirates, Chen Tian wen as one of the lead assaulters was observed to tote a Calico M960 9mm SMG - something really unknown at the time if confirmed.<br></div>
