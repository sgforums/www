Given the right amount of explosives any tank will be vulnerable. What tanks do against what is more of an effect of people who think war is only waged by getting the best weapons and charging in on a technologically weaker foe. Which is hardly the case.<br><br>What is wrong here is not the tanks (which are doing as well as they can given what they are taking), it is really the tatics that need to be worked on bringing the best abilities of the Merk against their foes and working to cover up their weakness. But I don't think they have any much better tank in the world to go into battle with.<br><br>I think people focus too much on the losses at times, one never bothered to count how many lives were saved by the tanks. While one may here reports of an Abrams or two being demolished by massive IEDs in Iraq, the truth is (and if you have seen the pictures), the tanks have held out very well in most cases to being attacked by IEDs that would have killed soldiers had they been in lesser machines.</div></blockquote>Agreed.  The IDF probably did not expect hezbollah to know how to employ anti-armor tactics with such effectiveness.  They probably knew about them having such weapons, but knowing how to use it effectively is a different story.<br><br>The Hezbollah have become very well trained fighting lot, no doubt trained by former Iranian or Syrian special forces or ex-military personnel.  We know that the Iranians and Syrians are the suppliers of such weaponry, and naturally, they would train Hezbollah to use them.<br><br>I believe one of the forumites here had a very accurate description of Hezbollah.  They are the "French Foreign Legion" equivalent of the Syrian and Iranian armed forces.<br><br>Hmm, since Hezbollah is jointly supported and trained by Iran and Syria, I wonder what will happen if relations between the two turn hostile? Would it lead to a possible break up of hezbollah?<br><br>Another thing. Has the Israelis fielded their Trophy system on the armored vehicles?</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>Israeli Tactics &amp; Strategy South of the Litani River.</strong><br>Re-posted from other Internet Forum<br>==================================================<br><br>It appears the tactics &amp; strategy employed thus far by the Israeli High<br>command are exposing their MBTs ( &amp; soldiers) to maximum disadvantage<br>vis-a-vis Hezbollah fighters south of the Litani river.<br><br>It appears that:<br><br>1/ Securing just 5km security zone is not sufficient. It appears<br>that even this thin strip of ''occupied'' 5km zone is not properly<br>garrisoned with enough Israeli troops! In many instances these<br>areas are re-occupied / re- infiltrated by Hezbollah after the<br>Israeli troops leave the area. Hezbollah can re-enter the<br>vacated area again &amp; again after the Israeli left. In turn,<br>Israeli troops have to re-conquer / re-capture the same piece<br>of ground again &amp; again. And each time the Israeli re-enter<br>the fray, their MBTs &amp; APCs &amp; combat bulldozers have to<br>endure / suffer the same hail of anti-tank fire (ATGMs) etc..<br>It appears the Israeli are paying for the same piece of ground<br>over &amp; over again!<br><br>2/ The tactic &amp; habit of sending in ground troops to enter &amp;<br>search every building &amp; house is very wasteful of Israeli lives.<br>Besides, many Israeli soldiers were caught inside these<br>houses &amp; buildings by Hezbilloh firing ATGMs into these<br>houses with the Israeli searching inside them!<br><br>There are many instances of tunnels &amp; bunkers built inside<br>houses, with inter-connecting tunnels between all these<br>houses etc... Hezbollah fighters can re-appear from under<br>these tunnels networks &amp; ambush the remaining Israeli<br>troopers by surprise.<br><br>3/ It appears the current tactics south of the Litani river is<br>dictated by a fear of Casualties on the part of the present Israeli<br>politicians ( who incidentally are not ex-generals like their<br>predecessors - ex-PM Sharon,Barak, etc...)<br><br>4/ To win the fight south of the Litani river, the Israeli MUST re-think<br>their tactics &amp; strategy.<br><br>a) Their must be more ground troops committed to the battle.<br>An additional 40,000 ground troops MUST be sent into<br>southern Lebanon to occupy all ground up to the Litani river.<br>This will create a buffer zone of at least 50 Km up to the<br>Litani river.<br><br>b) The extra 40,000 troops will form the NEW front line facing<br>Hezbollah. The existing 10,000 Israeli troops currently<br>battling Hezbollah will continue to liquidate Hezbollah positions.<br>However, no new supply of ammo or reinforcement will<br>reach any existing Hezbollah positions BEHIND the NEW<br>front line created.<br>Without fresh ammo &amp; fresh reinforcement, the positions<br>of all Hezbollah fighters behind the new front line are<br>unsustainable.<br><br>c) All houses &amp; buildings below the Litani river &amp; BEHIND the<br>new front-line will be destroyed/ flattened.<br>The occupants of the houses will be allowed to vacate the<br>buildings first. Special care &amp; attention must be paid to<br>get the old, sick &amp; aged folks out of these houses first.<br>All houses will then be bombed &amp; destroyed / flattened.<br>There is NO need for Israeli troops to fight from room-to-room<br>&amp; house-to house. This tactic is very wasteful of Israeli lives.<br><br>Once destroyed / flattened, the MBTs, APCs, combat Bulldozers<br>can be used to compact the rubble &amp; houses. This will ensure<br>hidden bunkers &amp; tunnels etc... will remain sealed forever.<br><br>d)The whole of the area South of the Litani River will be devoid<br>of any civilians. This whole area will be declared a free-fire zone.<br>Giant, intricate minefields will be constructed to deter any intruders.<br>It will be declared a no-go war-zone. No unauthorised movement<br>of any kind will be permitted, day or night.<br><br>e) The remaining city of Tyre will be fenced-in, together with the<br>remaining skeleton population. Tyre will eventually be deserted/empty<br><br>The existing 10,000 Israeli troops will continue to patrol &amp; garrison<br>the area behind the New front line to ensure Hezbollah cannot re-occupy<br>these areas south of the Litani river.<br><br>The New frontline will be manned by 40,000 fresh Israeli troops.<br>These 40,000 troops will be dug-in to face Hezbollah for the next phase of the war.<br>This could last a long time.<br><br>In the meantime, the war (including Aircraft &amp; Artillery) will continue as<br>per current tactics &amp; strategy North of the Litani river.<br><br></div>

A concussion wave would only take place within the tank if the hull actually goes through massive compression and expansion from the blast... which is not very likely in a 70 ton tank. However sometimes one might get HESH effects from the blast and you could have armour spalling within the interior from the shockwave acting against the hull. But AFAIK, most western MBTs have a spall liner to limit internal damage from fragments.<br><br>But what is known is that massive IEDs are a very inefficent way to kill an MBT. To demolish an Abrams as for it to be unrecoverable usually requires up to 200-300 kilos of improvised explosives that must explode when the tank drives straight over it. That 200-300 kilos could be used for a nuking lot of other stuff.<br><br>And that's only good for one tank. Most of the IEDs the M1s faced probably ranged in the lower grade and they stood up pretty well to it (usually suffering no more damage then that to the motive systems). It would work better to use AT mines or try to plink an RPG /ATGM shot into a weak area.<br><br>The main losses of US stuff to IEDs usually comes from hummers and the soft skins, not the tanks.<br><br>And as for Trophy, I don't think they have mounted them on the Merks yet... but I suspect the recent lessons might hasten that desire.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>An article from <strong>The Guardian</strong> that support my view in my earlier post..<br><br><a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/israel/Story/0,,1842204,00.html" rel="nofollow">The search for exit</a><br><br>Now its on how to save Israel's face...<br><br>Another article<br><br><strong>Israel struggles to capture strategic hills </strong><br><br>Conal Urquhart in Metulla<br>Thursday August 10, 2006<br><span style="font-style: italic;">The Guardian</span><br><br>Israeli forces today struggled to secure strategic hills close to the border town of Metulla, despite weeks of bombardment and days of fighting.<br>Dozens of tanks withdrew from hills close to the Lebanese Christian village of Marjayoun this morning and repeatedly came under anti-tank fire as they approached the border. One tank was set ablaze by a missile within a quarter of a mile of the village. The crew climbed on to another tank and were driven to safety.<br><br>As more tanks returned, pumping out smoke for cover, several more missiles were fired, narrowly missing their targets and setting light to scrub on the valley floor. A tank crew extinguished the fire in the damaged tank and towed the blackened vehicle to Metulla as Israeli artillery fired shells around it to create dust clouds for cover.<br><br>Israeli troops succeeded in taking control of one ridge east of Metulla. Scores of soldiers could be seen standing on the ridge next to a quarry, looking at the action in the valley below.<br><br>On a ridge west of Metulla, Hizbullah fighters fired anti-tank missiles, which resembled red darts, across the valley, exploding in a ball of fire on impact.<br><br>Throughout the night the valleys were illuminated and shaken by an endless bombardment. Tracer fire and rockets could be seen in the darkness.<br><br>There were reports of deaths and casualties in the fighting around Metulla but the Israeli army refused to comment until relatives had been informed.<br><br>The problems involved in taking control of the hills close to Metulla are the same all along the border. Although 10,000 troops and hundreds of tanks are deployed, Hizbullah fighters can easily evade them and attack when convenient.<br><br>"It is very difficult for a hundred tanks to find small teams of three or four men running over the hillside," said one soldier in Metulla.<br><br>According to reports, Israel is trying to remedy its failure to flush out Hizbullah fighters with air strikes and tanks by sending infantry into the villages on foot. Reuters quoted witnesses who saw Israeli troops moving on foot through Marjayoun about five miles inside Lebanon and neighbouring villages.<br><br>"I can see two tanks burning some 500 metres from Marjayoun," one resident told the news agency by telephone.<br><br>A third tank arrived later and removed several casualties, he said, adding that Hizbullah fighters were raining rocket and mortar fire on the Israeli force between Marjayoun and Khiam.<br><br>Both villages are dominated by Christian Maronites who were allied with Israel until it withdrew from Lebanon in 2000.<br><br>Hizbullah said in a statement it had destroyed 11 Israeli tanks, killing or wounding their crews in the fighting.<br><br>Israel has lost 82 soldiers in the fighting. Yesterday it lost 15, the highest number of fatalities in a single day.<br><br>The government decided to expand its operations in Lebanon, allowing the army to move to the Litani river, 18 miles inside Lebanon. However, there is growing dissent within Israel about the war's conduct.<br><br>Danny Yatom, a reservist general and senior member of the Labour party, said that moving deeper into Lebanon was pointless. "We are banging our head against the wall," he told Israeli TV. "And even if we reach the Litani, the Katyushas won't stop."<br><br>Some 160 rockets were fired at Israel yesterday and the pattern continued today. One rocket hit an Israeli Arab village, killing a two-year-old and an adult.<br><br>So far, the fighting has killed 120 Israelis, including 38 civilians. In Lebanon, officials say 711 people have been killed. The death toll among Hizbullah fighters remains unclear.<br><br></div>
