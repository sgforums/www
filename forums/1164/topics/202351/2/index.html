            <div class='col-md body'>The government in Lebanon is weak, and has allowed Hezbollah to do a better job than them. Hezbollah has already won the wills of the people by providing education, healthcare, public services. If the Israelis continue to destroy Lebanese infrastructure, it's to Hezbollah's benefit.

            <div class='col-md body'>Pls lah, only fools (or those who don't do their homework) assume the worlds best MBTS like the Abrams or the Merkava are unhurtable. Given the right amount of explosives any tank will be vulnerable. What tanks do against what is more of an effect of people who think war is only waged by getting the best weapons and charging in on a technologically weaker foe. Which is hardly the case.<br><br>What is wrong here is not the tanks (which are doing as well as they can given what they are taking), it is really the tatics that need to be worked on bringing the best abilities of the Merk against their foes and working to cover up their weakness. But I don't think they have any much better tank in the world to go into battle with.<br><br>I think people focus too much on the losses at times, one never bothered to count how many lives were saved by the tanks. While one may here reports of an Abrams or two being demolished by massive IEDs in Iraq, the truth is (and if you have seen the pictures), the tanks have held out very well in most cases to being attacked by IEDs that would have killed soldiers had they been in lesser machines.</div>
