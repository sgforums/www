Seems like that tank commander is literally 'exposing' his upper-half body (or is it just for their NDP only?) to be able to man that gun fully....I thought the protection provided to our SM1 tank commanders (esp manning the gun) is wanting but the PT-91 commander is WORSE!   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_redface.gif" alt="Embarassed" title="Embarassed"><br><br>At least the US Army learnt something (I hope!) from their experience in Somalia, but seems like the M'sian learnt nothing from their experience in Somalia (Hey!

            <div class='col-md body'>I thinkthe op-force the equipment they use does not reflect any country. I think bcos it is to prevent an uproar among our neighbours. But it is true to say Singapore or the other Asean nations were worried a military invasion by Vietnam back in the 70s as it was a threat that is all too real back in that era. This brings me to this question, why does our opforce do not use real non SAF gear and weapons. Yes, they should be trained inSAF doctrines but they should also be trained in other weapons to make them look more realistic.<br><br>I have read somewhere that China has this division named the blue army. The soldiers in that division is equipped with western weapons, like for example NORINCO version of the M-16. The officiers in the division are also expected to learn at least a few thousand English words, and the entire army fights on Doctrines of either USA, Russia, etc.........<br>Perhaps our opforce should chiong in other doctrines, the non-saf to provide realism.<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_twisted.gif" alt="Twisted Evil" title="Twisted Evil">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_evil.gif" alt="Evil or Very Mad" title="Evil or Very Mad"><br><br>I wonder does MAF have a opforce and who they model it as?</div>

Reason being none of our countries in ASEAN operate tanks in sufficient numbers and quality except in Thailand and Vietnam. We have close military ties with Thailand and they are quite a distance away. Vietnam is also far away and lack force projection capabilities. So these two countries are no threat to Singapore.Therefore the only logical explanation which i can find for the purchase of Spike missiles, Longbow Apaches,Matador and replacement of SM1 in the last few years, is that Malaysia already have MBTs.<br><br>But gary's explanation proves that we may just be simply preparing for the future. They also announced plans to buy submarines for a long time, almost 10 years ago but till now none is delivered yet.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote>Originally posted by Black Aces<br><br>Notice the height of the gun? or is there some mechanisms to 'elevate' the gun? Seems like that tank commander is literally 'exposing' his upper-half body (or is it just for their NDP only?) to be able to man that gun fully....I thought the protection provided to our SM1 tank commanders (esp manning the gun) is wanting but the PT-91 commander is WORSE</blockquote>You have made a very good point here. Our SM1 tank commanders are taught to view through gap between the 7.62 ammo box and the commanders hatch to guide the vehicle while on the move in combat situations. He is also to hold onto the handle of the coaxial MG to stabilise both himself and the MG. The aim is to enable the commander to guide the vehicle and observe the surroundings while keeping a very small portion of his body exposed.<br><br>From the Malaysian NDP pic i noticed that such a stance is impossible. The structure supporting the 0.5 HMG is too high and the only way for it to be fired is to stand at upright as shown in the pic. This is of course assuming that the supporting structure of the HMG cannot be adjusted.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Singapore WAS preparing to fight against a potential communist invasion in the form of vietnam rather than Malaysia when the US pulled out.  Vietnam (supported by communist China and reportedly Soviet pilots) had the capability then, to pour a million men down the peninsula. The SAF had to prepare to meet the Vietnamese in the Malaysian Peninsula instead of allowing them push through Malaysian Defences to siege Singapore.<br><br></div>

The two Skytrucks of a previous order were delivered to 918th Air Transport Regiment at Hanoi Gia Lam airfield in January.<br><br>Eight Przemyslowy Instytut Telekomunik-acji (PIT) MSC-400 maritime surveillance systems with PIT ASR-400 radars and PIT CCS-400 onboard command-and- control modules will be supplied to Vietnam, said Polish sources.<br><br>Datalinks for the Skytrucks will also be supplied as well as an undisclosed number of ground control stations. The total value of this PIT contract, which should be finalised shortly, has not been disclosed but it is believed to exceed $20 million. The system should allow Vietnam to create a modern maritime control system along its 2,000 km coast. Vietnamese sources said the selection of the maritime surveillance system is ongoing.<br><br>The Vietnamese People's Army Air Force will also receive four PZL Swidnik W-3RM Anakonda maritime search-and-rescue helicopters by 2007. These will be equipped with systems similar to those used on the Polish Navy's Anakondas, including Wescam's forward-looking infra-red turrets. A further four PZL Sokol helicopters, in passenger or VIP configuration, are being negotiated.<br><br>By the end of 2005, Profus Management will deliver 40 second- hand airworthy Su-22M4 fighter-bomber aircraft with necessary spare parts and weapons.<br><br>These will probably come from the Polish Air Force inventory but could be from other East European countries. <strong>In the same timeframe, the Vietnamese People's Army is to receive its first T-72 main battle tanks together with training and basic maintenance equipment as well as ammunition.
