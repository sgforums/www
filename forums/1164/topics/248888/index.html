            <div class='col-md body'>HasnÂ’t anyone seen last SaturdayÂ’s Strait Times LIFE? It carried a report saying actually Hollywood played a critical role in pressing Chinese authority to persuade Sudanese Government of accepting the UN peacekeepers. It seems the decision has arrived right after the Chinese envoy traveled to Sudan:<br><br><blockquote> Beijing yields - somewhat - to Hollywood pressure on Darfur<br><br>By Helene Cooper<br>Published: April 13, 2007<br><br><a href="http://www.iht.com/articles/2007/04/13/news/darfur.php" rel="nofollow">http://www.iht.com/articles/2007/04/13/news/darfur.php</a><br>WASHINGTON: For the past two years, China has protected the Sudanese government as the United States and Britain have pushed for United Nations Security Council sanctions against Sudan for the violence in Darfur.<br>But in the past week, strange things have happened. A senior Chinese official, Zhai Jun, traveled to Sudan to push the Sudanese government to accept a UN peacekeeping force. Zhai even went all the way to Darfur and toured three refugee camps - a rare event for a high-ranking official from China, which has extensive business and oil ties to Sudan and generally avoids telling other countries how to conduct internal affairs.<br>Why? Credit goes to Hollywood - in particular, to the actress Mia Farrow and the filmmaker Steven Spielberg.<br>Just when it seemed safe to buy a plane ticket to Beijing for the 2008 Olympic Games, nongovernmental organizations and other groups appear to have scored a surprising success in an effort to link the Olympics, which the Chinese government holds very dear, to the killings in Darfur, which, until recently, Beijing had not seemed too concerned about.<br>Farrow, a UN good-will ambassador, has played a crucial role, starting a campaign last month to label the Games in Beijing the "Genocide Olympics" and calling on corporate sponsors and even on Spielberg, who is an artistic adviser to China for the Games, to exhort China publicly to do something about Darfur.<br><br>In a March 28 opinion article in The Wall Street Journal, Farrow warned Spielberg that he could "go down in history as the Leni Riefenstahl of the Beijing Games," a reference to a German filmmaker who made Nazi propaganda films.<br>Four days later, Spielberg sent a letter to President Hu Jintao of China, condemning the killings in Darfur and asking Beijing to use its influence in the region "to bring an end to the human suffering there," according to Spielberg's spokesman, Marvin Levy.<br>China soon sent Zhai to Darfur, a turnaround that served as a classic study of how a pressure campaign, aimed to strike in a vulnerable spot at a vulnerable time, could accomplish what years of diplomacy could not.<br>Groups focusing on many issues, including Tibet and human rights, have called for boycotts of the Games next year.<br>But none of those issues have packed the punch of Darfur, where at least 200,000 people - some say as many as 400,000 - mostly non-Arab men, women and children, have died, and 2.5 million have been displaced, as government-backed Arab militias called the janjaweed have attacked the local population.<br>President Omar Hassan al-Bashir has repeatedly refused American, African and European demands that he allow a UN peacekeeping force to supplement an underequipped and besieged African Union force of 7,000 soldiers which has been trying, with dwindling success, to restore order in Darfur.<br>"Whatever ingredient went into the decision for him to go, I'm so pleased that he went," Farrow said in a telephone interview about Zhai's trip. She called the response from Beijing "extraordinary."<br>In describing Spielberg's decision to write directly to the Chinese leader, the filmmaker's spokesman said that while Spielberg "certainly has been aware of the situation in Darfur," it was "only recently that he became aware of China's involvement there."<br>At a news conference Wednesday, Zhai called people who wanted to boycott the Games "either ignorant or ill natured." But he added that "we suggest the Sudan side show flexibility and accept" the UN peacekeepers.<br>In closed-door meetings, Chinese officials have said they do not want any of their Darfur overtures linked to the Olympics, American and European officials said.<br>In an e-mail message Thursday, a spokesman for the Chinese Embassy in Washington warned anew against such linkage. "If someone wants to pin Olympic Games and Darfur issue together to raise his/her fame, he/she is playing a futile trick," the spokesman, Chu Maoming, wrote.</blockquote></div>

The chinese are going to face with increasing pressure on the supply of oil, Right now it is about having the foreign currency to invest and secure these pipelines.   So long as the expansion continue the Communist party will feel secure about its evolution and its existence.
