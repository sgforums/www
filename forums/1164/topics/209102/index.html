But to say that it is superior to that of the F-18 is a bit off...after all, the F-5 is a light fighter so the Iranian version is just an upgraded light fighter, therefore cannot be comparable to the F-18 which clearly have a heavier payload.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"></div>

The project F-5BR, as this program was called, upgrade the F-5 Tiger II to operate for more 15 years, until the Brazilian Air Force make the decision of the new main fighter (called F-X program) to replace the AMX, F-5 and the Mirage 2000 in 2020.<br><br>This Program, valued at US$ 285 million, foresees a massive modernization for the BAFÂ´s 55 F-5E/F aircraft, including a totally new avionic suite, navigation/weapons aiming/self-defense system, computer system, multi-mode radar, BAFÂ´s standard armament qualification and structural upgrade.

The F-5BR Program highlights The F-5BR solution is by far the most adequate and modern upgrade program for F?5E/F. It includes the latest technology available with the expertise of both companies in developing the right solution for the operational and budgetary scenarios of the Brazilian Air Force. All F-5E/F aircraft will be upgraded to ensure the F-5BRÂ´s required operational life of over 15 years. 4h Generation Technology - The all-glass cabin provides low pilot workload and was designed to the day/night, all-weather environments found in all operational theaters. The cockpit features a Hands-On Throttle and Stick (HOTAS) device, two high-performance computers and an Integrated INS/GPS navigation system. Three colored MFDÂ´s (Multi-Function Displays) and HUD (Head-Up Display) lead a state-of-the-art man-machine interface. All F-5BR systems and lighting were designed for night missions. A VHS-C video set records any pertinent flight data and audio for ground or in-flight reproduction. The 4th generation technology will allow also the F-5BR to include HMD (Helmet- Mounted Display), Data-link, Mission Planning System, AACMI (Autonomous Air Combat Simulation and Maneuvering Evaluation Instrumentation) and flight virtual training capabilities. A state-of-the-art multimode radar for Air-to-Air, Air-to-Ground, and Air-to-Sea ranging, searching, tracking, track-while-scan and air combat will be fitted to the F?5BR providing more accuracy, efficacy and self-defense conditions. It allows the rapid and effective deployment of the F-5BR. Performance - The aircraft maintains the same combat-proven operational characteristics of the F-5E/F already in operation with air force in Brazil, but dramatically improved and enhanced through the new systems included in the Embraer-Elbit F-5BR solution. Weapons System - The aircraft will carry a number of conventional and/or smart weapons used by the new-generation fighters, compatible with Beyond Visual Range (BVR) missiles, laser-guided bombs, cruise missiles etc. and sensors for all-weather, day/night missions. The F-5BR will be compatibilized with the BAFÂ´s standard weapons, already in inventory, such as the MAA-1 short range air-to air missile, as well as bombs and pods. Self-Defense Systems - Combat-proven Electronic Counter Measures (ECM) instrumentation plus a Radar Warning Receiver (RWR) are available. Low radar and infra-red signature guarantees a low aircraft detection susceptibility. Logistics - The on-condition maintenance programs are based on last-generation equipment and components.

            <div class='col-md body'>Yeah, F-4s.  They still have a couple of those operational.  I suspect that current estimates of "American" aircraft in their inventory serviceable is lower than the actual.  There has been a lot of rumored Russian assistance in this area.  There were even rumors of their F-14s capable of firing Hawk SAMs.</div>
