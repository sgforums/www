It was already obsolete after WW2 as the 81mm got introduced. The Soviets, if I'm not wrong, also switched from a similar light calibre (61mm?) to a medium (82mm) calibre for standard infantry mortar.<br><br>The 60mm was considered too weak.<br><br>The successful use of the 40mm GL during Vietnam completely made the 60mm obsolete as for almost the same bang, the 60mm was too heavy and not half as mobile or versatile.<br><br>Only the 81mm delivered a bang big enough to be considered artillery.<br><br>Tell you what I think is a definite must have for coy support. It is already in our arsenal and we probably already deploying this:<br><br>The AGL.<br><br>Our 40mm AGL is supposedly the lightest in the world blah blah blah...<br><br>This thing can lay down a fearsome amount of firepower - accurately - to completely saturate a small area. Furthermore, they also have a airburst mode, I think. This will kill people in trenches and behind cover. Can you imagine if you got a group of enemy infantry in the sights of your AGL? You would jsut tear them to peices.<br><br>The Chinese PLA also have developed a long barrel AGL that looks like a bazooka. The rounds are in a drum.</div></blockquote>good this is healthy. stand you point why it good and that it. anyone think other wise than we can futher discuss.<br><br>just want to know, any one carry/manpack a AGL 40mm b4? what is the weight? light role firing (if there is one, i am not sure because of the recoil), what are the hitting rate? anyone had any idea of the AGL 20mm that is going on?</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Actually it is not whether AGL will be a standard infantry weapon in most army  but rather when will it be a standard infantry weapon.<br><br>Handheld grenade launcher was already found to be very effective in Vietnam war, later came strapped on type like M203 which is so popular that practically every army have it now .<br><br>Next came the AGL with the higher velocity grenade, it is also became a standard weapon in most armies.<br><br>But the problem with conventional AGL, is that it is too heavy , thus only vehicle mounted, but that did not stop the AGL from been adopted.<br><br>I have posted number of manpackable version of AGLs that are either in the market or developing, it will next best thing for most army in the world.<br><br></div>

As with just 84mmRR, i saw and feel it just not enough. takes time to get in position. take note of black blast, heavy weight at 16.1kg, need 2 pax to operate.<br><br>that is why i feel the 60mm mortar is the best to have in the coy as a support weapon.<br>it light, easy one man operate, strong fire power. with 4 tube, it sure cause a big impact on the other side. i agree on the SLWAGL but weight is one thing we really need to look into and with smaller caliber the 30mm or even the 25mm, than what impact will it have than. yes it may have easy rapic fire but that means carry more rounds.<br><br>in this situation that the coy is facing. they are on the low/inferiors ground, the river bed where else i am on the high ground. trajectory are in play.<br><br>think about it. if you are AGL gunner and on the river bed, what are you going to face? what firing position are you going to take?</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Why no arty support? Why no air cover? Why moving along such a open terrain like a riverbed  - a whole company?<br><br>Why no scout or advance party? Why no troops moving along the high ground providing flank security?<br><br>The coy you faced were doomed from the start. They don't deserve to win and from what you described, they sounded like a bunch of amatuers.<br><br>Whether or not they had their own mortars would not have saved them from arty or airstrike.<br><br>During the second phase when they were engaged by your GPMGs at 650m, your fire would not have been too devastating so there would still be time to plan something better thought out than a frontal assault of your position.<br><br>There were many similar real situations where US troops were tasked to take on enemy well-entrenched in high ground in Korea and Vietnam. Very very heavy US arty and airstrikes including napalm against these positions proved useless as the defences were so well-built.<br><br>So even if the company you faced had 4 tubes of 51mm mortars and 50 rounds of HE it may not have made a big difference if your position was well-dug-in. Furthermore, being handheld with no proper aiming device, these mortars aren't accurate to say the least, even less so at 650m.<br><br>If I had them, I would use them to fire smoke to cover my advance to your position.<br><br>In the end, it will still be up to infantry suffering very heavy casualties to take these hills.

Instead of relying on map, memory and gps, they threw cylume straws on the ground. At Night, the cylume straws would have been very obvious. Sure enough, the enemy diverted the coy into an ambush later in the night (i heard).<br><br>Re air support, i think even if CAS was available, i dun think it would have helped them. This is because there is usually no Forward Air Controllers in the coy and the airplane will not dare to attack for fear of friendly fire.<br></div></blockquote>hope you did not mis read... my position... i am the opfor if you had miss out.<br><br>those had met us, the 1st OPFOR in 96 to 97 knows very well that the scout and CRT can't give much info to the BN and Coy at all and many unit Scout platoon, CRT and FOs were capture by us.<br>the best, most talk about was CDO ATEC in Thailand,(the case where my OC was butt stroke that very night) the whole scout platoon was capture during the day and some 'technical adjustment' was done that the PS was to 'give back' to the BN.<br>the BN basically go in blind during the nite.<br><br>and just another example happen in SG, another unit, the CRT was capture by my platoon and out of 'good will' we had mark out the route for the BN...  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_twisted.gif" alt="Twisted Evil" title="Twisted Evil"></div>

(But I also spent a great deal of time during NS in the Bde S2 branch.)<br><br>If my coy is tasked to walk across a wide open ground with surrounding high ground, I'm sure every man and his dog will be thinking the same questions. It's no't a matter of "if" the enemy will be on the high ground, but a question of "where and when" they will strike. The scenario you described is like those guys below just offered themselves for target practice.<br><br>Of course, I have read enough to know that a lot of stupidity occur in even the best armies and a lot of stupid orders are always handed out so men can get slaughtered on hopeless missions.<br><br>For sure I am only speculating that the handheld mortar is inaccurate. But, as there are no aiming devices as far as I can see, I cannot comprehend how you can fire it accurately, especially at the engagement distance you discribed. 600m is damn far away. Even on a clear day in an open ground, a human at 600m is a mere speck. A human sitting is a trench or behind cover you will likely not be able to see without optics.<br><br>Firing the handheld mortar will be like firing from the hip: you have to "walk" your rounds onto target. And a hand can't be that steady. And you need the whole shebang to accurately walk your rounds onto target at 600m.<br><br>You would need a commander/spotter to direct your rounds. For a handheld mortar, it would sound something like this: "...OK OK, now bend your elbows a little bit. Next your wrist you have to turn 3 degree to the right. Now hold it steady and give me one round of HE." And when you reach for the ammo your hand holding the mortar tube shifts. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_eek.gif" alt="Shocked" title="Shocked"><br><br>Also, from all that I have read of all the WW2 handheld mortars, they all said the same thing. That's why the M203 quickly replaced them.<br><br>Smoke will not be a double edged sword cos you engaged me at a distance of 600m. Only my GPMG and 84mm can return fire. This is beyond the effective range of my infantry with their 5.56mm weapons. So all they can do is to advance under the cover of smoke to get close enough to return fire.<br><br>All those who survive the initial 300m can redeploy to a leap frog type attack. And I think casualty rate from 2 GPMG firing from 600, 500m will be manageable. One platoon cover, 2 platoons move. All their weapons like M16, SAW and M-203 can be brought into play at this point.<br><br>One more thing I don't understand is how come after the initial barrage you don't continue to call for more arty on the attacking infantry?</div>
