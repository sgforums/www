            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by tvdog:</div><div class="quote_body">Well, I may just be a runner but there is one thing I know is: how to save my ass. (But I also spent a great deal of time during NS in the Bde S2 branch.)<br><br>If my coy is tasked to walk across a wide open ground with surrounding high ground, I'm sure every man and his dog will be thinking the same questions. It's no't a matter of "if" the enemy will be on the high ground, but a question of "where and when" they will strike. The scenario you described is like those guys below just offered themselves for target practice.<br><br>Of course, I have read enough to know that a lot of stupidity occur in even the best armies and a lot of stupid orders are always handed out so men can get slaughtered on hopeless missions.<br><br>For sure I am only speculating that the handheld mortar is inaccurate. <span style="color: red;">But, as there are no aiming devices as far as I can see, I cannot comprehend how you can fire it accurately,</span> especially at the engagement distance you discribed. 600m is damn far away. Even on a clear day in an open ground, a human at 600m is a mere speck. A human sitting is a trench or behind cover you will likely not be able to see without optics.<br><br>Firing the handheld mortar will be like firing from the hip: you have to "walk" your rounds onto target. And a hand can't be that steady. And you need the whole shebang to accurately walk your rounds onto target at 600m.<br><br>You would need a commander/spotter to direct your rounds. For a handheld mortar, it would sound something like this: "...OK OK, now bend your elbows a little bit. Next your wrist you have to turn 3 degree to the right. Now hold it steady and give me one round of HE." And when you reach for the ammo your hand holding the mortar tube shifts. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_eek.gif" alt="Shocked" title="Shocked"><br><br>Also, from all that I have read of all the WW2 handheld mortars, they all said the same thing. That's why the M203 quickly replaced them.<br><br>Smoke will not be a double edged sword cos you engaged me at a distance of 600m. Only my GPMG and 84mm can return fire. This is beyond the effective range of my infantry with their 5.56mm weapons. So all they can do is to advance under the cover of smoke to get close enough to return fire.<br><br>All those who survive the initial 300m can redeploy to a leap frog type attack. And I think casualty rate from 2 GPMG firing from 600, 500m will be manageable. One platoon cover, 2 platoons move. All their weapons like M16, SAW and M-203 can be brought into play at this point.<br><br>One more thing I don't understand is how come after the initial barrage you don't continue to call for more arty on the attacking infantry?</div></blockquote>1st... aiming device, the oni weapon without any will be a knife. please check do the 60mm have any b4 saying.<br>yah runner as you say you were and from me was a compliment to you for you can think and ask where the rest in here who say who there are can't.<br><br>have you fire a M203 b4? what accuracy are we talking here? 10%, 25%, 50% 99.9%... it all come down to what training has the man gone through. out of 10 rounds(M203) who can get 10 on point target. and who in SAF really had the chance of firing all 10 round in one go? max i think 3... maybe less now or maybe even dun have but just training round... curry powder...<br>there is no point telling one when one mind set was that 60mm cannot hit anything and best part is i dun think one had seen 60mmm handhald b4, even not to say one had fire 60mm. other than the photo i put up.<br>so if M203 can not have what ever accuracy you trying to tell me, why the 60mm can not be the same when it have a bigger caliber causing bigger impact, high trajectory...<br><br>yes M203 was replace fast for this handheld mortar. why? because it lighter, simple as that. and for that, but range was cut down, as for impact... well some say yes, some say no.<br><br>i dun know where you get the idea that arty fire can go on till no life was on the ground than you stop. have you call for fire b4? how many type of fire do you know there is? under what situation you can call for 1min, 5min, 20min bombardment and for this time what rates or how many round are going to fire onto the target area. allocation of fire... please dun ask me.<br><br>yes when you smoke out, it mean you dun see me i dun see you... you move... do i have to wait for you, when you counter why i can't. and btw, i had know where you are but you have not. read what was the scenario at that time again. even when some manage to move 300m... note all my weapon i am using is 7.62mm and i am on hight ground.<br>btw, ATEC OPFOR alway die in the end... oni a few cases where by unit cannot clear us fast enough, than the ex. director will call a halt to it for that mission.<br><br>again, if my man and i were sleeping, they will have by pass us and capture the final point, who will say that the CO is fcuk up. no one... it is this kind of 'things' ATEC try to instill into SAF fighting unit. that is why the 1st OPFOR is given so call 'full free play' of going on our mission.<br>it is to let them know enemy dun wait, enemy react.<br><br>back to topic again...<br><br>*60mm as i bring in, 4 tube, 24 round in one coy... and i think can have more if compare to the weight that some wish for a SLWAGL.<br><br>*2 sniper was brought in oso.<br><br>*SLWAGL... but how many pc never say yet, rounds to carry oso have not say.<br><br>who else has any other weapon or weapon systerm that you think should be or should have in the Coy support weapon.</div>

Tenix Defence Industries was a significant contractor to the project. ......<br><br>ADWS is based on integrating Metal Storm 40 mm stacked projectiles into a multi-barrel pod system and linking them with intrusion sensors and a fire control system.<br><br>The concept demonstration system comprised four weapon pods, each containing four barrels, networked and linked to a command and control station.  Each demonstrator pod has the capability to fire up to 20 projectiles in varying user-selectable combinations including rates of fire, barrel selection and firing sequence.<br><br>The live fire demonstration used inert projectiles, and engaged simulated targets based on information provided by a computerised sensor system.  Firing responses included a range of combinations from single shots through to a rapid-fire burst of 2O projectiles at a rate of 1500 rounds per minute.  The pods are able to fire at a maximum rate of 6,000 rounds per minute. More barrels can be added to each pod to increase payload as required......</blockquote>fr <a href="http://www.metalstorm.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.metalstorm.com/</a><br><br>more awesome images fr <a href="http://jczs.sina.com.cn/2004-03-06/1647186106.html" rel="nofollow">http://jczs.sina.com.cn/2004-03-06/1647186106.html</a><br><a href="http://jczs.sina.com.cn/2005-07-15/0829305963.html" rel="nofollow">http://jczs.sina.com.cn/2005-07-15/0829305963.html</a></div>
