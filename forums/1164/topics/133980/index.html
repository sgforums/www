            <div class='col-md body'>My take on this is that the 60mm mortar is  not suitable for our infantry units.<br><br>Yes, the weight of the weapons is relatively light, but does anyone here consider about the wieght of the ammo load??<br><br>The weight of the ammo is abt 1.4 ~1.85 kg per round, how many could one men carry , and many men needed for one 60mm mortar team?<br><br><blockquote>In the Marine Corps, our 60mm guns were usually in three gun-squads in a 20-man mortar section commanded by a lieutenant, reinforcing each Rifle Company. Each gun-squad consisted of a squad leader, gunner, assistant gunner and 3 ammo bearers. In deployment for action, the ammo carriers humped 6 loads, in addition to their weapons and equipment. On the move, the gunner carried the complete mortar w/o sight, and all other men carried ammo bags or packboards strapping 12 loads. In addition all men carried their equipment and a carbine, and the squad leader carried the M4 sight. </blockquote>From the above, US team have a 6 men  squad with 3 ammo bearers , here a bit confusing,  3 ammo bearers with 6 loads, that's mean 2 load each.<br><br>One the move , it is double?<br><br>Anyway, you need such a large team becos of weight of the ammo, the US coy level 60mm mortar support is practically a platoon level in SAF context.<br><br>Could SAF afford an additional Pl?<br><br>If you say only one mortar per coy, will it be effective?<br><br>Next is , we need to have arty trained officer for that squad, becos 60mm mortar is an indirect weapon which is usually use in defilade, thus higher prob. of situation like blue on blue, thus I believe we need a well trained arty officer for that squad.<br><br>All the info could be found from here :<br><br><a href="http://www.rt66.com/~korteng/SmallArms/60mm.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.rt66.com/~korteng/SmallArms/60mm.htm</a><br><br>Then we already have 81/120mm mortar in support coy with max range of abt 3km for 81mm and 9km for 120mm( non rocket assist).<br><br>With 120mm mortar, the range is sufficient to support any coy, in Bn level missions, that should not be problem. If it is only coy missions, then some 120mm mortar could be attached to that coy.<br><br>Thus I think a small mortar for coy level is not needed.<br><br>But to increase the firepower of Pl/coy level, there is a great interest in producing a manportable automatic grenade launcher(AGL), I believe in US, they have developed 20mm manportable AGL. Not sure it is operational or not.<br><br>Likewise, ST also came out with 40mm SLWAGL(max range 2.2km) which weight abt 14kg, not sure this include the tripod or not, but becos of the much lighter ammo, I believe that this could be much smaller team, due to that you dun need too many ammo carriers for the required ammo load.<br><br>For example, 4 men team, section commander for sight( if they are using ABMS), the gunner with SLWAGL, asst gunner with tripod plus one box of ammo, and one ammo carrier with two boxes of ammo.<br><br>The advantage of this team over the 60mm is that a smaller team , most likely able to carry more ammo and we dun need to have arty trained officer.<br></div>

Hence direction and altitude settings are normally controlled indirectly by a forward observer, or an aiming stake about 10-25 yards forward of the gunner, ..........l. </blockquote></div>

Several times we have ridden to excercise areas in civilian buses in full combat gear. We debus - literally - and then march on foot. People find it very funny to see buses full of fully-armed chaps all looking a bit sheepish at the very unmilitary transport.<br><br>Later on I think this is not because we have not enough trucks but it seemed like a good test of using civilian assets in times of war. (The Israeli did this during their mobilisation for the 6-Day War.)<br><br>Later on, we sometimes had the use of a fleet of V-200 but they are not a integral part of our unit. I guess they were trying out a lot of stuff with our unit but mostly, we were very lightly armed for a battalion.<br><br>And like I mentioned we always have a GPMG team with us but strangely, they are not an integral part of any of the rifle platoons. Definitely no 84 as none of us ever had to carry 84 spare ammo.<br><br>Our training is mainly assaulting FIBUA and FOFO. And once or twice, big coastal defence excercises.<br><br></div>
