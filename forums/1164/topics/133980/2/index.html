            <div class='col-md body'>Another very funny thing about my unit:<br><br>we were issued with short 20-round magazines!<br><br>At first I couldn't believe it and I thought it was a temporary thing.<br><br>But then when they issued us with the (then) new Israeli-type chest (bra) webbing, they came with pouches for 20-round magazines only!<br><br>A few years earlier when I was in the Guards unit we were already issued with the chest webibings and they all came with 30-round mag pouches.<br><br>So I was quite shocked as my whole life I had never used 20-round magazines. These were like Vietnam era, only brand new. Or very well preserved and unused.<br><br>The officers wouldn't comment or don't know. I asked one trainer and all he said was "we have a warehouse full of them".<br><br>But it's a damn funny situation. The SAW gunners were given 30-round mags but M-16 users all had 20-round mags. I felt very humiliated by this and until today did not understand the reason. Logistically, it made no sense to have 2 types of mags and webbings for such a small armed force like ours.<br><br>Sure, we were issued a lot of old and obsolete equipment like the 12kg PRC-77 radioset I carried, but since we were an assault force and not a static defence force, these 20-round mags were a joke.</div>

It was already obsolete after WW2 as the 81mm got introduced.

It is already in our arsenal and we probably already deploying this:<br><br>The AGL.<br><br>Our 40mm AGL is supposedly the lightest in the world blah blah blah...<br><br>This thing can lay down a fearsome amount of firepower - accurately - to completely saturate a small area. Furthermore, they also have a airburst mode, I think. This will kill people in trenches and behind cover. Can you imagine if you got a group of enemy infantry in the sights of your AGL? You would jsut tear them to peices.<br><br>The Chinese PLA also have developed a long barrel AGL that looks like a bazooka. The rounds are in a drum.</div>
