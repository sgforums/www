But its already on...[b]Just that they r racing with don't know whom. Who have artillery shooting standard ammo going out to 30km around here? Do we? They just keep buying n if they get good training on them it will be a differ story. </strong>In a test between MIG-29 n F16, MIG won in the dogfight before F16 could fire. Y? Better design thus having two pieces of tech the other don't(those the west didn't have)n good training but may not be a better one. The rest around want to buy new equipments too but no money or ppl suited to use them. But it not totally about having high tech stuff sometimes its a matter of having n not having. Look at iraq...US have more dead now than in the wars, who more high tech? Any kind of equipment if used correctly produces results, but u must have them in the first place....<br><br>Look at wat i last wrote in bold. Well u r right about 155mm 52 cal n MIG-29 never won in combat. But they r using 155mm <strong>45 cal </strong>. In mock fight between Luftwaffe MiG-29s  n USAF F-16s, pilots found that any aircraft within 45deg's of the nose of a MiG-29 in ACM was always under grave threat due to it's helmet mounted sight. Do we have Joint Helmet Mounted Cueing Sys that's the question...USAF planes got them. N if they got the SA-11 SAM that's on their list, they then can simultaneously attack up to 12 targets flying at speeds up to 3000 km/h at ranges from 3 to 32 km n at alt between 15 n 22000 m. System reaction time is 8-10 sec. N yes they r getting Su-30...Now they have BVR missile too. Su-30 design retains the best features of the unsurpassed Su-27 air-superiority fighter boasts enhanced functional cap.Engines with thrust-vectoring nozzles enable Su-30 to perform such maneuvers as vertical reverse, roll in,turn in etc. In these maneuvers, an angle of attack can reach 180o. These are not aerobatic maneuvers as this supermaneuverability can be effectively used in combat. As for F-16, their max angles of attack are 30o n can't use armament at supercritical angles of attack.Su-30Â’s supermaneuverability gives it superiority in close air combat in which it excels F-16C Block 50 by 10-15%, F-16C Block 60 by 20-30%(as the high wing loading significantly limits its maneuverability in close-range combat).<br><br>N if they don't retired MIG-29s but upgrade them n add to Su-30s? They should have around 57 fighters in whole if they have enough crews.<br><br><strong>Quote from mag Aviation Week and Space Technology:</strong><br>Sukhoi Su-30MK, the high-performance fighter being exported to India and China, consistently beat the F-15C in classified simulations, say U.S. Air Force and aerospace industry officials.In certain circumstances, the Su-30 can use its maneuverability, enhanced by thrust-vectoring nozzles, and speed to fool the F-15's radar, fire two missiles and escape before the U.S. fighter can adequately respond. THE SCENARIO in which the Su-30 "always" beats the F-15 involves the Sukhoi taking a shot with a BVR missile (like the AA-12 Adder) and then "turning into the clutter notch of the F-15's radar," the Air Force official said. Getting into the clutter notch where the Doppler radar is ineffective involves making a descending, right-angle turn to drop below the approaching F-15 while reducing the Su-30's relative forward speed close to zero. This is a 20-year-old air combat tactic, but the Russian fighter's maneuverability, ability to dump speed quickly and then rapidly regain acceleration allow it to execute the tactic with great effectiveness, observers said. If the maneuver is flown correctly, the Su-30 is invisible to the F-15's Doppler radar--which depends on movement of its targets--until the U.S. fighter gets to within range of the AA-11 Archer infrared missile. The AA-11 has a high-off-boresight capability and is used in combination with a helmet-mounted sight and a modern high-speed processor that rapidly spits out the target solution. Positioned below the F-15, the Su-30 then uses its passive infrared sensor to frame the U.S. fighter against the sky with no background clutter. The Russian fighter then takes its second shot, this time with the IR missile, and accelerates out of danger.<br><strong>End of quote</strong><br><br>They wanted AWACS(looked at Brazilian Embraer EMB-145, E-2C Hawkeye 2000 n Boeing's 737 Wedgetail) but only money stopped them.<br><br>Very large numerical advantage in term of fighters didn't do israel any good did they? So superior training n tactics would put them ahead<strong> if their crews got them.</strong> For now, we r better trained but we should not stop even for a while to let them catch up.<br><br>[/b]</blockquote>The so called mock exe with their restricted ROE and simulation cannot  and will not tell us what will really happen in real battle!!!!<br><br>First thing , all our fighters have HMS plus high off boresight AAM now , remember Python 4 and future AIM-9X!!!!<br><br>Secondly no one will ever know how they will perform in the real battle with all the electronics warfare going on in the background and these will never be simulated becos it cannot be simulated and secondly all these data are hghly classified!!!<br><br>So how will Russian missile perform against Israeli plus US ECM and ECCM in real battle???

We can't afford to....Must KO ppl first...Cos there's no coming back. If mock exe with restricted ROE don't work tink all the outfield exe we did gone to waste already... Everytink we also mock then how like that? We have Python 4??? Like i said sometimes having it, is better than not having. Better to have n not need it then need it n not have it..... Russian stuff cheap may not be worse or more ex than western types but good enough...That's y the west kana shock sometimes when after USSR fell n they got their stuff to check performance compared to theirs. May not be high tech just have better ideas. We want to learn from other ppl experiences not our own. Sounds bad but true.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Is this Clutter notch maneuver as potent as the internet observers claim it to be?  Come on, if u beam and dive after launching ur AA-12, whose gonna guide the missile until it goes autonomous? The AA-12's pk is gonna be drastically reduced without guidance.<br><br>When the RWR bleeps at u telling you a Sukhoi's painting u, (provided ur AWACs didn't tell u in the first place, u'd probably be asking for them for more info on it), u don't just stay there and get locked. U're not gonna wait for him to shoot first before taking actions of your own.<br><br>And being lower and slower due to recovery from a "clutter notch" manuever, he's more vulnerable to being shot at should u get a return shot at him, since he's at a lower energy state than you are.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>One issue I would like to point out is serviceability. I might be wrong on this but their armed forces hasn't proven to have had a stellar record as far as getting machines to the line (squadrons being disbanded, aircraft being grounded).<br><br>We are talking about high tech equipment here, be it main battle tanks or fighter bomber aircraft. How many aircraft can you serve up for a given mission to provide the critical mass required to ensure success?<br><br>Their most numerous fighter is the BAe Hawk and apparently there is 28 of them. Add the various F-5 derivatives, MIG-29 ( 18 ), and F/A-18s ( 8 ), and you have probably less than 100 aircraft to cover peninsula Malaysia, Sabah and Sarawak.<br><br>Singapore no longer has brute numbers of A-4s since those are retired. There are 40 of the old F-5 Tigers (including reconaissance), and 62 Vipers of which an unknown number is in Singapore, the rest being in the US.<br><br>Plane to plane, the F-16 may have a hard fight with either the MIG-29 or the F/A-18, but combat is no longer fought in isolation, not as long as there is situational awareness (I would assume Malaysia's is ground-control-based, while Singapore's is more likely AWACS).<br><br>What I found on the web with regard to helmet mounted target cueing systems:<br>http://www.f-16.net/gallery_item44107.html<br><br>When all is said and done, RSAF has its own high tech niche and training, but our neighbours may not be as strong in this aspect, their experience and training in jungle warfare should never be underestimated.<br><br>We must always remember, if we ever had to set foot militarily across the causeway, we are playing in THEIR backyard.<br><br>Show some respect.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote>So never understimate anyone. </blockquote>No one is under any illusion as to underestimating anyone. It would most certainly be the case if the references(of the MAF)are fiction. But they are not. The MAF will be in a lot of trouble in the event of war because of a series of unfortunate events. And certainly fortunate for us. And discussing it certainly does`nt constitute disrespect. I have seen worser comments made the other round in thier forums. You might never know that somehow, one day, the government up north might acquire the right amount of rationality as to allow them to fix the MAF.<br><br><blockquote>Malaysia is too big a country to be bombed into submission. So there would have to be a lot of ground fighting where the jungles can render aerial superiority of RSAF less effective. </blockquote>Are you sure? When the whole of RMAF and what little air defences are gone, the RSAF can bomb at her leisure and quite literally push back decades worth of nation building. I hardly think it is in Singapore`s interest to conquer and take over governance. The whole idea is to push back an invasion by bringing the fight to the enemy. If the Malaysian terrain is to be turned into a mass of rubble, would that be bring comfort to the government and people there? The MAF can retreat and hug the trees in the jungle for all they care; if the industries and technological centres are pummelled to the ground, they`re back to where they`ve started two-three decades ago and that brings a whole gamut of problems to the folks there .They would be incapacitated as an invasion force and that`s all that matters. And Singapore can do this again and again(does`nt this sound familiar). The whole world can pass you by as you`re stuck fighting in warrens. As a nation, where would Malaysia be then? It is not for nothing that some commentators have labelled Singapore`s approach a `dooms-day' tactic.<br><br><blockquote>So, when it comes to ground fighting, do we still have a huge superiority over the MAF?I think not.<br></blockquote>We have numerical superiority. We have technological superiority. And the argument about conscripts versus professional soldiers has been rehashed so many times. How professional and how efficient a trooper would be depend on training and morale then other things. Some things which the MAF does not and cannot be said to have monopoly in.<br><br><blockquote><br>Furthermore, the average SAF soldier is city born and city bred - though we train in the forests all the time and some real JUNGLE training overseas.quote]</blockquote>Not unless you can quantify and qualify a city-bred soldier performs worser than a villager, this presumption is no different than saying a soldier from a Western country would be worse off in a different setting. The average Singapore soldier is certainly more more disposed and exposed to more `techy' equipment and doctrines than the average Malaysian soldier could hope. Advancements which have a multiplier effect on the whole battle situation.<br></div>
