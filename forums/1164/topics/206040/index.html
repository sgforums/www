            <div class='col-md body'>Its defense consists of 394 ERA, 108 placed on the turret, 118 on hull n 84 on each sides anti cumulative screens. The main ERA difference in PT-91 is they fit almost without gaps while on the Soviet modernised T-72 gaps reach 10 - 15 mm noticeably decreasing defense effectivity. Exp showed that ERA dynamic defense decreases high explosion stream proofing depth by 50 - 70 % n undercaliber projectiles by 30 - 40 %. Furthermore ERA doesn't detonate when hit by bullets, projectile or mine frag, burning napalm or petrol. PT-91 has thermosmoke device generating smoke screens from fuel n 24 grenade launchers fitted with smoke or anti-personnel grenades.<br><br>SM1's Turret armour thickness leave it blank.... Hull Thickness Front 15mm, Sides 20mm. So can main gun do double tap at same spot? Or do we have a tank gun tandem AT round? Would we even scratch it that's the question....Looks like more SPIKE ATGM orders<br></div>

The ROK or the American initially had zero AT capability - not even one single AT mine. And their 2.75 inch bazookas couldn't even damage the T-34. Rockets from airplanes and shells from howitzers similarly had no effect.<br><br>The unstopable T-34 was the deciding factor that destroyed the ROK and then pushed the Americans all the way t the Southern tip of the Korean peninsula.</div>

This was something that was told to me by one of the armor warrant officers.  The question is not whether the 50cal can penetrate or not, (account for deflection), its what kinda damage can it do IF it penetrates.  For one thing, the chances of it triggering a catastrophic explosion is a hell lot lower.<br><br>0.5 cal anti material rifle, a few well placed shots at the engine block or the driver should disable the vehicle.<br><br>In anycase, my point is that a Metis-M, tandem warhead ATGM is a huge overkill for an SM1.<br><br>Honestly speaking, our SM-1 numbers may not be as numerous as claimed.  I've seen quite a number SM-1s or AMX-13s (un-upgraded, stripped down, rotting, rusting) lying  in "storage" cos they couldn't be condemned.<br><br>Hence, those Metis-Ms are not directed at our "numerous" SM-1s in particular.

This was something that was told to me by one of the armor warrant officers.  The question is not whether the 50cal can penetrate or not, (account for deflection), its what kinda damage can it do IF it penetrates.  For one thing, the chances of it triggering a catastrophic explosion is a hell lot lower.<br><br>0.5 cal anti material rifle, a few well placed shots at the engine block or the driver should disable the vehicle.<br><br>In anycase, my point is that a Metis-M, tandem warhead ATGM is a huge overkill for an SM1.<br><br>Honestly speaking, our SM-1 numbers may not be as numerous as claimed.  I've seen quite a number SM-1s or AMX-13s (un-upgraded, stripped down, rotting, rusting) lying  in "storage" cos they couldn't be condemned.<br><br>Hence, those Metis-Ms are not directed at our "numerous" SM-1s in particular.  IMO, our BXs are a bigger threat to them.</div></blockquote>One thing , no one truly know how many we have becos all of them is estimates, the reason is we went to many countrries in the 70s to 80s to buy many their of retired vehicles and planes etc, put in new engine, electronics etc when we built up SAF.<br><br>For example, estimate of M113 is abt 720~1000s, AMX-13 is around 350, Tempest from 60~100s , Skyhawk 60~80 etc.<br><br>And they serve us well, we got it cheap , refurnished/upgraded them, so the exact number is unknown and SAF was built up with a large force with a pretty low budget and more than sufficient to handle the threat in SEA.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Honestly, they never truly buy what they say and use what they buy. And they make lots of noises about things which they dont have currently. They do have superb forward thinking I would think. They would claim to have an interest in something and think about it for years up to even a decade or more. And never really come to a decision. Thier purchases are more reactionary as opposed to revolutionary. The PTs are a counter to what we have albeit in lesser numbers than they could possibly hope. Russian tanks have`nt exactly fared well in major wars i think in spite of inflated hyperbole; which applies to thier air-craft fighters as well.</div>

Well u r right about 155mm 52 cal n MIG-29 never won in combat. But they r using 155mm <strong>45 cal </strong>. In mock fight between Luftwaffe MiG-29s  n USAF F-16s, pilots found that any aircraft within 45deg's of the nose of a MiG-29 in ACM was always under grave threat due to it's helmet mounted sight. Do we have Joint Helmet Mounted Cueing Sys that's the question...USAF planes got them. N if they got the SA-11 SAM that's on their list, they then can simultaneously attack up to 12 targets flying at speeds up to 3000 km/h at ranges from 3 to 32 km n at alt between 15 n 22000 m. System reaction time is 8-10 sec. N yes they r getting Su-30...Now they have more BVR missiles. Su-30 design retains the best features of the unsurpassed Su-27 air-superiority fighter boasts enhanced functional cap.Engines with thrust-vectoring nozzles enable Su-30 to perform such maneuvers as vertical reverse, roll in,turn in etc. In these maneuvers, an angle of attack can reach 180o. These are not aerobatic maneuvers as this supermaneuverability can be effectively used in combat. As for F-16, their max angles of attack are 30o n can't use armament at supercritical angles of attack.Su-30Â’s supermaneuverability gives it superiority in close air combat in which it excels F-16C Block 50 by 10-15%, F-16C Block 60 by 20-30%(as the high wing loading significantly limits its maneuverability in close-range combat).<br><br>N if they don't retired MIG-29s but upgrade them n add to Su-30s? They should have around 57 fighters in whole if they have enough crews.<br><br><strong>Quote from mag Aviation Week and Space Technology:</strong><br>Sukhoi Su-30MK, the high-performance fighter being exported to India and China, consistently beat the F-15C in classified simulations, say U.S. Air Force and aerospace industry officials.In certain circumstances, the Su-30 can use its maneuverability, enhanced by thrust-vectoring nozzles, and speed to fool the F-15's radar, fire two missiles and escape before the U.S. fighter can adequately respond. THE SCENARIO in which the Su-30 "always" beats the F-15 involves the Sukhoi taking a shot with a BVR missile (like the AA-12 Adder) and then "turning into the clutter notch of the F-15's radar," the Air Force official said. Getting into the clutter notch where the Doppler radar is ineffective involves making a descending, right-angle turn to drop below the approaching F-15 while reducing the Su-30's relative forward speed close to zero. This is a 20-year-old air combat tactic, but the Russian fighter's maneuverability, ability to dump speed quickly and then rapidly regain acceleration allow it to execute the tactic with great effectiveness, observers said. If the maneuver is flown correctly, the Su-30 is invisible to the F-15's Doppler radar--which depends on movement of its targets--until the U.S. fighter gets to within range of the AA-11 Archer infrared missile. The AA-11 has a high-off-boresight capability and is used in combination with a helmet-mounted sight and a modern high-speed processor that rapidly spits out the target solution. Positioned below the F-15, the Su-30 then uses its passive infrared sensor to frame the U.S. fighter against the sky with no background clutter. The Russian fighter then takes its second shot, this time with the IR missile, and accelerates out of danger.<br><strong>End of quote</strong><br><br>AA-12 Adder missile has active radar finder n max range of 90 km n flies at four times the speed of sound. It's described as an all-aspect, all-weather, fire-and-forget weapon that can be employed in a countermeasure environment. If the seeker is jammed, it switches automatically to a passive mode n homes in on the source of jamming<br><br>They wanted AWACS(looked at Brazilian Embraer EMB-145, E-2C Hawkeye 2000 n Boeing's 737 Wedgetail) but only money stopped them.<br><br><strong>Very large numerical advantage in term of fighters didn't do israel any good did they? </strong>So superior training n tactics would put them ahead<strong> if their crews got them.</strong> For now, we r better trained but we should not stop even for a while to let them catch up.<br><br></div>
