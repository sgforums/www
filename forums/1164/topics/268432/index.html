Another challenge was to ensure that the instrumentation or gauges actually survive and serve its function during the blast because of the very strong environment around. This instrumentation of gauges have to survive to produce the correct readings."<br>Broadcast on 8 February 2006 - 8am, 12pm, 2pm &amp; 7pm<br>Engineers worldwide have speculated that water is effective in reducing the harmful effects of explosions.<br><br>Thus, the Defence Science and Technology Agency or DSTA conducted two large-scale water mitigation tests in Sweden last year with the Swedish Defence Research Agency.<br><br>The tests validated that water can be used to reduce effectively the amplitude of blast pressures in an enclosed environment.<br><br>DSTA's project lead, Mr Ng Chor Boon explains how water mitigation is effective in Singapore, "In land-scarce Singapore, the concept of the water mitigation can potentially be used to minimise the amount of land around the explosive storage facilities that needs to be set-aside as safety buffers. In that sense, the land savings created can be quite significant."</blockquote>3.<strong><a href="http://www.xin.sg/video.php" rel="nofollow">Recenly,UK also reveleavd this technology</a></strong><br><img src="http://www.xin.sg/imagegallery/store/phpVN3Xtv_m.jpg"><br><br>4.<strong><a href="http://www.sgforums.com/?action=thread_display&amp;thread_id=144028&amp;page=1" rel="nofollow">Strengths of our defence capability</a></strong><br>1.

But the energy from the<br>explosion vapourised the water,<strong> reducing the effect of the blast by 60 per<br>cent.<br></strong>Hailing the results as a major breakthrough, DSTA chief<br>executive Richard Lim said yesterday that defence<br>engineers worldwide had considered using water<br>barriers to reduce the effect of an explosion.<br>But none had tested the idea on the scale of the<br>experiment conducted in Sweden last month.<br>He added that the experiments are important as water<br>barriers can potentially reduce the amount of land<br>needed as a safety buffer around ammunition bunkers.<br>Mr Lim updated the media on research developments<br>at DSTA when he unveiled a 60-page book to mark five years of DSTA's achievements.<br><br>The book will be distributed to organisations such<br>as government bodies, tertiary institutions<br>and public libraries.    DSTA was formed five years<br>ago from several Ministry of Defence departments to<br>serve as the national authority on weapons procurements<br>and military technology.    Mr Lim added that another area<br>his engineers are working on is to help<br>national security planners assess the impact of a<br>bomb blast, similar to the car bomb detonated outside<br>the JW Marriott Hotel in Jakarta. The August 2003<br>terror attack killed 12 people.<br><br>'One of the scenarios that we are looking into is<br>the extent of building damage and casualties in<br>the event of a car bomb exploding near or at the<br>entrance of a hotel, similar to the attack at the<br>Marriott,' he said.    From its analysis, using compute<br>r modelling and other tools, DSTA will<br>recommend measures<strong> to minimise casualties<br>and damages, if not prevent an attack.<br></strong></blockquote>2. <strong>More than 6 years of effort to confirm water as buffer   </strong><br><blockquote>In undertaking this project, MINDEF achieved<br>a number of ground-breaking results in R&amp;D.<br>Significant achievements have been made in <strong><br>water mitigation </strong>and ground shock studies.<br>Water mitigation makes use of water to absorb<br>the energy of an accidental explosion. This greatly<br>reduces the safety buffer zone, freeing up land<br>for productive use. Ground shock studies enables<br>our engineers to formulate structural engineering<br>codes for the safe construction of buildings in areas<br>affected by ground shock effects. This also reduces<br>land wastage.</blockquote>fr Speech by Mr David Lim, Minister of State for Defence and Information &amp; the Arts, at the Ground-Breaking Ceremony for the Underground Ammunition Facilty   Email Article    Dd: 12 Aug 1999,<br>fr <a href="http://www.mindef.gov.sg/imindef/news_and_events/nr/1999/aug/12aug99_nr.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.mindef.gov.sg/imindef/news_and_events/nr/1999/aug/12aug99_nr.html</a><br><br>Pl note Sg rewrite ammo storage code for NATO.</div>
