            <div class='col-md body'>Report: IAF whips US pilots in exercise<br>By ARIEH O'SULLIVAN<br><br><a href="http://www.jpost.com/com/Archive/24.Sep.1999/News/Article-3.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.jpost.com/com/Archive/24.Sep.1999/News/Article-3.html</a><br><br>TEL AVIV (September 24) - A recent joint exercise between the IAF and US Navy Sixth Fleet pilots apparently resulted in a thorough routing of the US pilots, according to the latest edition of Air Force Monthly.<br><br>The American-based magazine said the exercise in question took place in the Negev skies and involved engagements between IAF F-16s and US Navy F-14s and F/A-18s.<br><br>Quoting Israeli military sources, the magazine said one of the exercises ended with the score of 40:1 in favor of the IAF. The magazine said Israel "downed" 220 aircraft for the loss of just 20 of its own.<br><br>It said that the results have not been officially published "to save the reputations of the US Navy pilots."<br><br>The magazine did not say when the exercise took place. But security sources said that the dogfights took place about three months ago. They said the exercise was the first time that Israeli pilots actually took part in the maneuvers and didn't just give logistical support. Israeli pilots have also flown with various flight academies as guests or students.<br><br>The IAF said it does not give detailed results of training exercises. But air force commanders were said to be incensed by the report. While refusing to confirm or deny the report, military sources said neither Israel or the US had officially released the "scores."<br><br>"We showed an arrogance we didn't mean to display," one senior IAF officer said.<br><br></div>

But RSAF certainly have more to gain by training with IAF instead of USAF particularly in dogfight.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I heard that the RSAF wins the USAF from time to time during red flag exercises. This shows that we are roughly the same standard as them if not slightly better!

            <div class='col-md body'>I don't think any RSAF pilots have engaged their USAF counterparts in mock combat and won trophies for it.  According to an officer form my camp, the RSAF maintenance crew have won trophies before for excellence in support and one squadron got the "Curtis LeMay" Trophy once.  The CT cup is given to the attack/bomber outfit which performed the best bomb run (navigation, release etc)<br><br>The IAF pilots are truly the supreme elite of the world.  Tom Clancy described in his book that children with potential are noted by their academic supervisors (secondary school teachers, PE coaches and outdoor activity counsellors etc) who submit yearly assessment reports to the manpower branch of the MoD.  This is called "talent scouting"<br><br>Pilot recruitees have their background scrutinized and apparently only males of strong Jewish backgrounds are considered.  Me thinks this has something to do with the government wanting to form a military aristocracy in the "white arm" of the service.<br><br>Cohorts of would-be potentials are subjected to a week long march in sunburned arid areas and are deprived of sleep and given meager rations of food and water.  The purpose of this trial is to weed out those who are mentally fortified from the whole lot whom are already physically superb specimens.  The motto "Fighter first, pilot second" truly applies.<br><br>So by the time the selected batch of pilot trainees sit down for their first introductory lesson, every single one of them are already the cream of the crop of Israeli society.  And I haven't gone on to the course dropouts/washouts yet!<br><br>"Train hard - fight easy"<br><br></div>
