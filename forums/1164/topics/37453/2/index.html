It probably is meant for use when the rest of the building is cracking up BUT has not totally been destroyed yet.  Also think about it, even if the shelters remain standing while the rest of the building falls, how do the people in the shelters get out??  The lower floors will be trapped by rubble and can't get out, the middle floors will have to crawl down the rubble and pray it does not collapse more, and the upper floors can only watch other climb down or jump and hope they don't break too many bones when they land! <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_sad.gif" alt="Sad" title="Sad"><br><br>Currently, Singapore does not as yet have enough shelters for the whole population.  I wonder if any stations along the new MRT line can be used as bomb shelter.  It makes sense to strengthen them and then use them as shelters if they're underground. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"><br><br>And many of you will be mobolised even before the bombs and rockets start flying and falling so you don't have to worry about where to hide. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br><br>my two cents</div>

I happen to be living in a block where we have common basement shelter shared by 8 blocks. Of course, its now a minimart....hopefully the proprieter can clear it in time when needed (hopefully leaving some essential stuffs like keropok etc). Even that's the case, it takes 4min to reach there from my front door, down the flights of stairs and to the shelter. That's normal time with no other human traffic, in emergency I can run but so will everyone else from the 8 blocks. And the entrance<br>only allow 1 person in at a time.<br><br>In normal case, you wil not be at the door waiting......you will do your normal routine activity right ....like pangsai, sleeping, or having some 'fun' with your partner.
