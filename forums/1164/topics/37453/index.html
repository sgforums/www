Anyone have any idea what is 1st 2nd and 3rd Gen. then for such a weapon??? i have no idea. . .  and cruise missile? never heard anything about that before. . . Also, anyone has any idea whats the cost of the whole thing, esp. its rockets, since Malaysia could actually launch so many rockets for a demo, I think the rockets are most likely not too expensive, which is not heartening for Singapore.  Only thing to knock this thing out from a distance is through use of helicopters, SS80 rockets are like twice the range of Singapore arty. . .<br><br>And i just remembered. .. if Malaysia really gets cruise missiles, Singapore will probably have to get the land-launched version of the Barak</div>

It took 117sec for the rockets to reach the target area. Since it was a sea target, the effects of the weapons cannot be seen. And it was only done this way because they is no live firing range long enough for this demonstartion. The army plans to get the SS30 (35km) range so that the next live firing can be conducted at Asahan and the effects can clearly be seen.<br>Each rocket weighs 535kg and contains tens of anti-personnel and anti-tank submunition and can cover  1 sqkm.<br>The MAF plans to get another regiment equipped with Astros later.<br><br>Now you can make some calculations,<br>each launcher - 4 rockets<br>18 launchers - 72 rockets.<br>To blanket an area of 644 sqkm - 9 salvoes needed.<br><br>When next regiment becomes operationally ready - 36 launchers.<br>To blanket an area of 644 sqkm - 5 salvoes needed.<br><br>First salvo to target - 2min.<br><br>Basically, your worst nightmare!<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>another reason why we are not firing many rockets is bcoz it is expensive.<br>RM 17M for the exercise.<br><br>and for your info, the ASTROS II fires its rockets and inside the rockets, there will be small bombs and the rocket will open when reaching a certain height and the bomblets will be able to cover a very wide area..<br>so its not like : you fire the rocket...and the rocket hits the target...the <strong>bomblets</strong> will hit the target...that is why it is so lethal</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>i am not as optimistic about that ASTRO2 (for simple.. i will call it A2)<br><br>first... my biggest question and doubt has been why they launch the rockets out to sea... according to them.. its because they dont have the neccessary firing range... i have the following doubt...<br><br>1... the A2 wasnt bought overnight... surely there are more then enough time for MAF to prep a land for the LF if they so wanted..<br><br>2... considering the size of malaysia... and the abundance of uninhabited land.. including sparsley populated east malaysia.. it should not take much time at all to cordon an area for such a LF exercise...(unless their rocket is so damn inaccurate... they dont think they can find that big piece of land even in malaysia for LF!! <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"> )<br><br>3... if they no have a LF range... why they so desperate to conduct the LF without it?? so much so... they are willing to waste 17million ringgit of rockets... to just see it shoot into the sea??<br><br>therefore... i suspect.. that the real reason for conducting a LF into the sea is possibly because they wanna hide something....<br><br>by firing the rockets into the sea... they can at least achieve 3 objectives...<br><br>1... they can hide the accuracy of the rocket.... including the rockets reliability ( how many rockets really reach the targeted range)<br><br>2... they can hide the firepower of the rocket (as we all know... submunitions are not really power against armored targets, HDB flats and hardened bunkers) its actually no more then an expensive system to throw 64 grenades across a long distance...<br><br>3... they can hide if they really really got rockets with submunitions, although such purchase is possible... but the distribution of the submunitions are subjected to wind and other laws of physics... which may not result in even coverage over the entire zone...<br><br>the above are just merely my personnel suspicion... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br><br>lastly... considering that it took over 100 second for the rocket to reach its destination... its within the SCDF's and SAF's ability to detect the rockets... sound the civil defence alarm and get as many singaporean into the HS for safety...<br><br>the effectiveness of this system against singapore HDB land will be limited over time as singaporeans gets more alerted and more ready to move into the HS at a moments warning...<br><br></div>
