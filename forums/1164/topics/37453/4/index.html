Mines with destructable fuse will be good so as to clear it up after the war , yet we are able to slow the A2 down. Once the A2 are up , we are almost dead , thus the govt ( being so calm now ) should be thinking of a solution either to counter the rockets on air , or to destroy it before it fires.<br><br>The A2 test fire is on sea and if we are capable enough , actually our Sjoormen can recon great deal out of that. Eventhough we cant escalate the real firepower of the A2 on water , we can still do alot of calculations on it.</div>

With desert terrain , it provides saddam with a almost 100% area to fire the Scud from anywhere he likes. Scuds being extremely mobile is hard to locate , once recon pick out the Scud group , air strike will begin onto it.<br><br>However if it travels in darkness , and out of the sudden fire from an unknown area . By now satelitte and Greenpine will be able to pick them up , which is too late , thus the Patriot will serve the last line of defense.<br><br>Y is it not related to our situation. 1) Malaysia is not that big.  2) Thick Vegetation disallow them to fire anywhere they like , thus reducing their operational area and maximising our chance of locating them. 3) They have onli 18 of those system to be use on two territory 4) We dun have last line of  defense yet to block an attack thus removing it on the ground is important.</div>

It  may be a reasonable defensive system agaisnt the rockets , however some rockets contain submunition which will disperse in mid-air . The missile have to intercept the rocket b4 it disperse the munitions.<br><br>Y not have S300 which will can shoot down the rockets within 20+ seconds of launch.(maybe 30+km away ) The warhead may be armed with high explosive to down the mass of rockets in mid air , then with baraks to down the remaining few heading toward singapore. S300 will also post a large threat to the RMAF which tries to hold air-superiority over the peninsula.<br><br>The israeli and the American had been designing a laser defence system for years , and with current laser technology , i believe it will be available now or not soon...<br><br>Most importantly , our infrastructure have to be design to take in such attacks in case they throw in the first punch. Tengah airbase for example have been upgraded with blast-proof bunkers to absorb such threats. Sembawang AB shd follow up suit so that our helicopter which are the backbone of our rapid deployment can survive any pre-emptive strike on our soil.</div>
