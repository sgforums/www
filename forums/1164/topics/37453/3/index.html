            <div class='col-md body'>isit really really true that 17million ringgit were spent just firing 48 rockets??<br><br>plus the cost of the launch vehicle, command vehicle, manpower and blah blah blah logistics... the cost of that 48 missile could easily hit 20million ringgit...<br><br>THAT works out to 416,000 ringgit per rocket fired!!!!!!! *DROP JAW*<br><br>20million ringgit for SAF FH2000 ICM rounds... SAF can fire a horrendous 100,000 cargo rounds carrying a devastating 6,400,000 bomblet!! *DOUBLE DROP JAW* compared with RMAF rockets carrying a total of 3072 bomblet... that is a huge difference...!!<br><br>other then the benefit of the MRLS rockets in terms of range... is there any other benefits of that MRLS???<br><br>bottom line:<br><br>in terms of RANGE: ASTRO 2 wins...<br>in terms of accuracy: i think arty is better...<br>in terms of firepower: i think arty is better...<br>in terms of mobility: i think ASTRO 2 wins unless compare with SPH or LWH... then its a tie..<br>in terms of economy: Arty seems more efficient...<br><br>other points...<br><br>singapore FH2000 is build locally, thus replaceable, and the shells including ICM are locally manufactured, thereby facilitating easy stockpiling, resupply and techonological flexibility to upgrade or alter...<br><br>Malaysia's A-2 on the other hand is build in brazil, sent across the entire pacific ocean, the rockets are also manufactured in brazil, futhermore, its so expensive, making stockpilling a difficult and expensive exercise, even trainning might be affected in view of the high cost....<br><br>anyone disagreed?</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>no doubt about it... i would hate to be on the recieving end of the MRLS and knowing that our arty cant take it out even if our arty can hit 100km range since the mobility of the A 2 would easily enable it to make a run for it before the counter battery shells hit....<br><br>this would imply that... with the increase mobility of long range platforms.. it is becoming more and  more vital for all military units including infantry and armor to have fleeting legs to avoid being on the recieving ends of a massive long range attack...<br><br>it would also imply that some sort of protection from such a platform is becoming more and more urgently required...<br><br>else... everyone would sooner or later purchase huge amount of such platforms and a war of attrition will ensue..<br><br>just think.... wat if thailand also buy a hundred A 2 laucher, singapore buys 200 and indonesia buy 300 launcher??<br><br>at 90 km range... if indonesia deploys 300 A 2 launcher in sumatra... the entire peninsula malaysia can be hammered into the ground... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"></div>

If they plan to use it as an offensive weapon, they would have gotten the shorter range SS30/SS40 rockets where you get more rockets per launchers. If they want to launch pre-emptive strike, they can position the lauchers in johor for such a purpose, and comes H-hour, just fire salvoes of the rockets.<br><br>How to position it in Johor without being detected etc can be left to the military planners....not so difficult right, night movement, paint the trunks so that it looks like an ice cream trunk (Astros II don't look much diff from normal commercial trucks unlike US tracked MLRS) etc etc.<br><br>The reason they chose the longer range rockets is that they plan to put it far away from sg, but yet be able to move it quickly via the network of highways. So if sg arty launch pre-emptive strike, they will counter with longer range  Astros II and since MLRS can blanket large target areas, shoot and scoot method with FH2000 no longer effective.<br><br>So that is why some rumours say that FH2000 is to be put on reserve when M109 version comes in service.....M109 provide armor protection to the crew unlike FH2000. Not sure about the effectiveness of M109 against anti-tank submunitions tho....seems like M109 is quite light compared to the euro SP arty. Still some protection is better than nothing.<br><br>Only problem about the AStros II is that it generates a huge smoke cloud from the backblast.....location can be detected once fired, but only useful if you can strike fast coz, its quite mobile.<br><br>just my opinion....<br><br></div>

If they plan to use it as an offensive weapon, they would have gotten the shorter range SS30/SS40 rockets where you get more rockets per launchers. If they want to launch pre-emptive strike, they can position the lauchers in johor for such a purpose, and comes H-hour, just fire salvoes of the rockets.<br><br>How to position it in Johor without being detected etc can be left to the military planners....not so difficult right, night movement, paint the trunks so that it looks like an ice cream trunk (Astros II don't look much diff from normal commercial trucks unlike US tracked MLRS) etc etc.<br><br>The reason they chose the longer range rockets is that they plan to put it far away from sg, but yet be able to move it quickly via the network of highways. So if sg arty launch pre-emptive strike, they will counter with longer range  Astros II and since MLRS can blanket large target areas, shoot and scoot method with FH2000 no longer effective.<br><br>So that is why some rumours say that FH2000 is to be put on reserve when M109 version comes in service.....M109 provide armor protection to the crew unlike FH2000. Not sure about the effectiveness of M109 against anti-tank submunitions tho....seems like M109 is quite light compared to the euro SP arty. Still some protection is better than nothing.<br><br>Only problem about the AStros II is that it generates a huge smoke cloud from the backblast.....location can be detected once fired, but only useful if you can strike fast coz, its quite mobile.<br><br>just my opinion....<br><br></div></blockquote>I guess the 24 SA (Fire Finders) has to be fast enough to detect the trajectory of the rockets...IF they are within range of our 155s.<br><br>Another solution is to use special forces...like the Scud-Hunters of the Gulf War, these guys could be called Astro hunters....hahaha!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"></div>

It will be not a good asset against Astro.  If the war happen, it is very likely that the emeny will get their 1 or 2 round of fire in action before we can detect and destory it. The bad news for SG is that MY is likly to buy somemore ASTRO in 2 years.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>yep, the range of the firefinders are about 50km....so unless sg gets a better upgrade, it won't be so effective against MLRS 90km away. Moreover, how does it performs against massive rocket attack.....will the large numbers of rockets overload the computing power of the system ?<br><br>Visual targetting from the air is more realistic....but then only after launching can you see the huge smoke cloud.<br><br>Tho RSAF is the top dog in SEA, its still no where near the capability of the USAF in Iraq where they had total supremacy over the airspace plus a whole host of satelites and JSTARS to help them in '91. Even with this, Scud hunting was not really a resonding success. M'sia thick vegetation is far more challenging compared to Iraq's desert terrain.<br><br>Even with the above challenges, and to his credit, the M'sian General has not ignored the possibilty of air attack. Hence, the 2nd part of the news release where he mentioned about the induction of new Shorads and manpads system.<br><br>Clearly, the entire demostration was a PR exercise and to serve as a warning that the capability gap will be narrowed. Expect more arm purchases to be announced end this year at Lima '03.</div>
