During NSF, some from my platoon including me were attached to a BTEC exercise, but not in Singapore. The BTEC reservists did combat jump and straight on to mission. I was attached to a safety vehicle for that event and had quite afew laughs seeing some of them getting stuck in trees while our vehicle raced to reach the "strays" and some clever ones landing in shallow duck ponds, much to the amusment of the ducks! I take my hat off to those guys in the Charlies for tolerating a stomach-churning ride... the planes made more than 15 (i kept count then) unsuccessful passes for about 1/2 hour due to strong wind conditions before we finally saw the first guy jumped out the door!<br><br>I'm no longer in strike ops, so i probably won't be doing anymore combat jumps... but who's to tell?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"></div>
