              <p>I'm not sure because the samurai sword is an illegal weapon, unlike the knives on sale at Sheares.</p>
              <p>Maybe OCS swords will have their edge even further blunted.</p>

              <p>Firstly, japaese swords aren't illegal. You require special permits to own these and I already own a few. Buying it from Caesars or Sheares just means they as the distributor handle the permits and take down your IC particulars.</p>
              <p>Once again....and it will never end, some mudder farker decides to use swords/knives to harm others. This will definitely hurt the collectors and enthusiasts, what what actual restrictions that may come into place, remains to be seen. Which is why I'm constantly reminding the new collectors to know when to withhold silence when it comes to sharing shipping and licencing details to unknown anonymous ppl over the internet.</p>
              <p>Secondly, as I managed to examine pictures of the sword used in the attack. I will say that this is NOT EVEN A JAPANESE SAMURAI SWORD. Every fine detail about the shape and length is WRONG. It takes a knowledgeable sword appreciator to know this, the first thing I spotted wrong was the length. And I know my Japanese weapons...the sword that was used was only made to 'LOOK JAPANESE' but its not a replica of any kind and defnitely not authenthic in any way. This moron either smuggled it in, or went to some junk yard novelty store in Chinatown to find it. Thankfully, the damn thing is blunt or the injuries sustained by the victim would have been much worse.</p>
              <p>My Post on Stomp:</p>
              <p>Firstly, that sword is not even an authentic Japanese sword of any kind or even a replica, it was just made to look 'Japanese'. Newspaper journalist and the police should really do more research or at least approach the sword experts in Singapore for more clarification if need be. I've been a Japanese sword appreciator for over 9 years and am also a local sword and knives collector and a Kenjutsu student. This is not something you'll find at any of the Caesars outlets in Singapore, I frequent that place often to know what's sold there. This is some junk yard crap he managed to smuggle in from overseas. Customers who can well afford them, at least the more expensive good quality swords won't waste their money attacking people with them when a lousy knife which is small and conceals better, does a better job. Anyways, this case happened way back in January, I don't understand why Straits Times has to publish such old news just because the court case happens now.</p>

              The Mini Canadian and Mikro Canadian are wonderful knives.
              
              On my end, I am considering either the Bravo necker or the new Pocket Bravo as my next small knife.  In the end, I will probably get the bravo necker, for the kydex sheath and for neck carry. (Don't tell me to get both...)

              <p>I understand your reasoning, but I find it rather idealistic. </p>
              <p>Honestly, I'd rather it'd be an obscure hobby. Singapore has no knife culture, even if you were to openly publicize and attempt to educate people, the majority of Singaporeans will still stick to the mindset of it being an obscure and mysterious hobby. Maybe after 10-15years will you see some shift in mindsets.</p>
              <p>You could argue though that this is why we should begin educating people now, but I'd like to bring up the fact that Singaporeans lead far too sheltered lifestyles and many take their personal safety forgranted. Singaporeans in my opinion, are still too immature to begin a weapon-culture of any sort. In fact many Singaporeans become easy targets when they travel abroad (I didn't say this, it was statistics published in the news), and its really because Singapore is a safe country to live in compared to many neighbouring countries. But recent events have shown that weapon assault rates have gone up.</p>
              <p>To be honest, there's not much restriction on owning knives. People can already buy reasonably good knives from Sheares and Caesars. If a newbie wishes to buy a knife, I always suggest them to go take a look at those places first. So no biggie, yet all these years people still think the hobby is obscure and mysterious and rare. It's only that way because the only people actually interested in knives and swords are collectors and morons up to no good. Needless to say, the morons get more publicitiy and attention when they do shit with their items.</p>
              <p>The sharing of shipping and licencing info should only be shared to people whom a collector discerns is of mature and sound mind. There's no hard and fuss rule about this and there's no full-proof way of any of us doing a 'quality check' on the person whom we share this info with. However, if you have a heart for innocent people who got attacked with weapons and feel a need to help keep this country safe, then play your part. </p>
              <p>Take note, I never said, not to share info. I just said, be discerning to whom you share the info with.</p>

              <p>@Jethrotay : Caesars has some Smith and Wessons. I do sell knives legally, mostly to people whom I know and or mature adults via recommendation but the items I sell tend to be the more premium modern production brands (e.g. Benchmade and SOG). For entry-level brands like smith and wessons, Caesars should be fine, it's cheaper on the wallet too. Hahaha, I mean, the stuff I bring in have MSRP prices of US$150+.</p>
              <p>@Jocelynxh : Unfortunately, there are some legal ramifications with 'carrying a knife out for self-protection'. You actually need a licence for that too in Singapore. Don't ask me why, I didn't come out with that law.</p>
              <p>@alize : XD I would only migrate if I'm offered a better paying job and better life overseas. The idea is tempting for sure. Na, the police wouldn't be bothered with me, I have friends in the police force anyways.</p>
              <p>@Improvision : For EDC Knives, honestly I suggest using the Spyderco Sharpmaker system with triangle sharpening stones. I'm personally using them and also bought the extra fine and synthetic diamond stones. It's not cheap but I highly recommend them, one customer recently got them from me as well. Um, essentially I have a chopper thats been with my family for like 18+years. I sharpened it till it could shave hair off my arm. :)</p>
              <p>The only problem now is I don't have a leather strope which should be the finishing polishing item. That really helps remove the 'teeth' on the edge which will help keep the knife sharp longer (also depends on your steel type). If by accident, the 'teeth' roll over, your blade will be dull again, so its actually very important to strope the blade after sharpening. </p>

              <p>Hi <a href="http://sgforums.com/users/259559">XKCobraDraconis</a>,</p>
              <p>Thanks for the response. Prior to dropping a message here, I was considering the DMT aligner kit which has diamond whetstones up to Extra Extra Fine (3 micron / 8000 mesh). I think that might reduce the teeth and allow edge rentention longer.</p>
              <p>As for Spydie, they don't mention the grit specification?</p>
              <p>I was looking towards manual sharpening by getting waterstones. Was thinking that someone could teach me? I found out that a certain degree of angle must be held when sharpening. Wouldn't dare to try without guidance and ruin my toys...</p>

              </p><p>Jethrotay: (Site: http://www.caesars.com.sg/web/index.php) They have an outlet on the top floor of Plaza Singapura and at J-Cube as well. Both outlets carry knives, I saw Smith and Wesson knives at both outlets. I sell mostly folders. I have brought in some fixed blades before. What kind of knives do you like anyways? LOL, it's easier for you to tell me than the other way round.</p>
              <p>Improvision: Oh, I know that sharpening system as well. Although I haven't tried it myself, I personally don't really like it. The engineer in me is screaming, "TOO TACKY!!!!" and also I highly doubt it maintains the angle once the rod strays too far.</p>
              <p>Ya, my gripe with Spyderco is that they don't mention the grit. Though it doesn't really matter, after the extra fine stones, the sides of the edge actually appears very mirror-like to me. So I expect that its sufficiently fine. </p>
              <p>Haha, I considered waterstones before, especially for sword sharpening, however, the set of 9 stones I wanted would cost me US$400+ excluding shipping. And so I decided, not a good idea. XD Yes, the angle is important. For fine slicing edge, 15 degrees on each side. Typically, kitchen knives would benefit from this degree. For combat knives and choppers, you want a stronger edge, so 20 degree angle on each side. Of course, if your steel is very hard and can retain the edge, you can still go for 15 degree angles each side. It's really your preference. The difficulty is maintaining the angle whilst doing sharpening, it's a trial and error process really, it's not something easily taught.</p>
              <p>I suggest buying a crappy $50-70 knife and blunting it. Then practice sharpening it. It'll help a lot. I had enough practice with my spyderco set (it requires some skill too, especially for different kitchen knives), so I now know how it works. </p>

              <p><br>Haha, I don't carry stock. My friends usually just come to me with a weblink, asking if I can bring in certain knives which they like. I need the brand and model of the knife. Then I'll source for the cheapest available option and get it for them.</p>
              <p>The cheapest knife which I own is probably the Heckler &amp; Koch Tactical Snody Instigator (manufactured by Benchmade) : <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Heckler-Benchmade-Tactical-Snody-Instigator/dp/B003E16XCG">http://www.amazon.com/Heckler-Benchmade-Tactical-Snody-Instigator/dp/B003E16XCG</a> . It's fixed blade and makes a very good back-up knife. But you got to constantly oil the whole thing often.</p>

              <p>Very nice Landi Knife you have there Ahle91! Ya I honestly feel the same about Smith and Wessons too, which is why I don't own any.</p>
              <p>I tend to buy knives from a usage perspective and handling perspective since I'm a martial artist and I do train to use my knives. It's not so much for just collection-sake. So how I select knives would be different from people who solely collect for the sake of "Oh! Thats pretty!". Nothing wrong with that of course, haha, just that sometimes it does burn a hole in the wallet.</p>
              <p>I have to agree that Benchmades are really overpriced, but they make good folders. Same with SOG. Steel type and construction is my priority, 2nd is design and 3rd handability and portability.</p>

              <p>Yes I think it banning knives is as hard as banning saws, screwdrivers etc. But the Singapore government always has a way.</p>
              <p>Dogs and snakes- I've never had to fear wild dogs, and I would run from snakes. I have more to fear from the penalty for cutting any branches while camping, or even setting my camp in an "unauthorized" place.</p>
