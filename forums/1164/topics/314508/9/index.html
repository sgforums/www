              <p>Nice to see some collectors in Singapore... There are seriously too few stores to buy from. Anyway my collection is mostly BMs, Spydercos and Kershaws with the few Vics here and there. Haven't updated my pics but here are a few from my collection. I only collect folders BTW.</p>

              <p>S30V sharpens very well and stays sharp for a very long time. It is my preferred steel. Sharpens easily with a diamond stone though I reckon any steel is easy work for diamond. It is specifically made for knives and the rust resistance is really good. I won't get one as a chopper though... It's pretty expensive (compared to AUS8, 440C and high carbon steels) and it is not very impact resistant. I like the less fuss maintenance of stainless especially since humidity is a big issue in SG and the region.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>BTW.. the handle is green anodised titanium.. Colour looks odd in pics. Always ends up looking blue.</p>

              <p>Yeah... Using a basic camera. Not much of a photographer... Yup I know Fallkniven knives. Since most of their stuff are fixed blade I'm not very interested. I find a lot of their stuff overpriced for the materials used... VG-10 isn't exactly premium stuff. Spyderco has been using them for a long time. And they seem pretty expensive for a made in Japan product.</p>
              <p>You can get a custom for the price of some of their knives. Anyway I think they make great users. Very tough (could have used one when I went backpacking a few months back)... Not too good as a collector's knife.</p>
              <p>Too rich for my taste. I just bought a few more to add to the collection... Kershaw JYDII, JYDII Titanium and a Splyderco Ocelot. That'll be it for this month. Will see if I can get a pic of them soon.</p>
              <p>What do you have in the collection?</p>

              <p>I beg to differ on the VG-10 part...they are expensive because of their properties and restriction for exports...</p>

              <p>kay, so basically me and my fren want to start an extreme sports cca when we go to rjc, and we were wondering if we could get balisongs. so no shops sell it in singapore rite? and anyway if we want a folding knife, what choices do we have, where can we buy them from and roughly how much are they?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>thanks in advance</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>EDIT: okay ive been thinking and i think balisongs are not worth the trouble, seeing as its kinda illegal and everything. so does anyone know a shop where we can get cheap folding/fixed blade knives like the ones mentioned in this thread? doesnt have to be branded, just usable.</p>
              <p> </p>

              <p>Now that RAT-3 interests me... Is it the Ontario version or the

                  been meaning to get the RAT-3 D2 for a  week long backpacking
                  trip to Australia at the end of the year. No need for anything
                  bigger...</p>
              <p>Have you used it hard? How's the edge holding?</p>
              <p>Been an expensive month... Spent too much on knives again.Anyway
                  iIt'll be my last purchase for a while. If you're anywhere in the

              <p>Hi,</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Msn at nehpyh@hotmail.com if you are interested to meet. Location is not an issue for me.</p>
              <p>I have the RAT3 (D2 steel) by Ontario because it is cheaper than RAT. However, if given a choice again, I would have gone for original RAT. It's not that Ontario is inferior - just that the handle is a tat short even for asian size (I'm 1.73m). Being short handle is good for utility but suffers a bit if you ever need it as weapon but whatever superior being out there forbids it. But I hope you get my drift.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>As for edge holding, I have not truely trashed it during my reservists but being D2, good but slight more to the brittle side by 0.000002% :p so take care when hammering it with a sledge hammer. Should perform fine for any other chores.</p>
              <p>I'm not sure if if you already had it but if you are getting your first or last 3" fixed blade, get the Fallkniven F1. Period. No other current fixed blade can win that. It'll last a lifetime and frankly you can frame up the rest of your other 3".</p>

              <p>kay, so basically me and my fren want to start an extreme sports
                  cca when we go to rjc, and we were wondering if we could get
                  balisongs. so no shops sell it in singapore rite? and anyway if we
                  want a folding knife, what choices do we have, where can we buy
                  them from and roughly how much are they?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>thanks in advance</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>EDIT: okay ive been thinking and i think balisongs are not worth
                  the trouble, seeing as its kinda illegal and everything. so does
                  anyone know a shop where we can get cheap folding/fixed blade
                  knives like the ones mentioned in this thread? doesnt have to be
                  branded, just usable.</p>

              <p>Hi Lazy Sam,</p>
              <p><br>I dun mean to sound like your school principle but baliisong is not a 'knife'. It's a fancy toy that happens to have a sharp edge. A dangerous toy for adult.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>And if you are serious with your reputation and outdoor activities, you wouldn't want to bring a ballisong to camps. Peeps will laugh their heads off.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>For outdoor and survival activities, you need something sturdy with minimal mechanism cos you dun wish things to break while you are trying to cut chicken, chopping firewood, or releasing someone from harnesses gone wrong.</p>
              <p><a href="http://www.swissarmy.com/MultiTools/Pages/Product.aspx?category=outdoor&amp;product=54876&amp;">For your case, I strongly recommend a simple and affordable Swiss Army Knife a.k.a. SAK. </a></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I'm not sure if you can find the model but you can go to Marina Square and there is this sport shop near GV and they have some SAK. Can bargain for a good price. Get something close to the link above.</p>
              <p>What is good about the one above is that it has most utility tools you need for camp. It's hi-grade stainless so you dun have to worry about rust. Also, it has thumb-assist so that you can open the blade with one hand.</p>
              <p>BUT DUN GO AROUND BRANDISHING THIS, I WARN YOU!</p>
              <p>Also to note, it's not how great or expensive or big your knife is....it's how you use it safely, responsibilty and learning the skill to care for it.</p>
              <p>Try to sharpen your kitchen knife until you can shave your leg hair and you are there. :p</p>

              <p>Oops,</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Something is wrong with the SAK link, but if you google <em>One-Hand Trekker German Army</em> you should be able to find it.</p>

              <p><img src="http://www.sheares.com/" alt=""></p>
              <p>For online purchase/ imports:</p>
              <p>Do refer to earlier posts on importing knives. But basically, it is possible except for knives which are considered contraband like ballisong, stiletto, double-edged cutlery, and mechnical assisted knives. Be careful and read up from Singapore Police Force website before you go retail therapy.</p>
              <p>If you need fixed blade knives, try Shears Technology <a href="http://www.sheares.com/">http://www.sheares.com/</a> They are not cheap cos they need to make a living but generally you can get decent knives from them saving you the hassle of internet, credit card, ICA, and CID. They are of course helpful.</p>
              <p>There is a Rambo in everyone of us (similar to there is a Beng in everyone of us...), try to refrain yourself from getting any blade larger than 7". The bigger the knife, the less utility it becomes and more silly you look. Imagine sitting around camp with something sticking up your **&amp;^@#$....</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Remember, knowning how to use a tool is more important than the size of the tool. Unless you have the Napolean Complex.</p>

              <p>When choosing a folder, anything bigger than 3" is a joke. 2.5" is ideal.</p>

              <p>Ask around your army fren who are orcifer. They are issued with Ka-bar and some orcifer only use it as letter opener. Buy from them for a token. </p>
              <p>I got mine from a Hall mate and the knife even has his full name and rank engraved! Well, at least I do the Ka-bar justice by using it!</p>

              <p>As long as it's within the accepted range, it should be no prob. What is the acceptable range? Follow the link <cite>www.<strong>spf</strong>.gov.sg/licence/AE/others/List_AE.pdf</cite></p>
              <p>And it should be in the check-in and not hand carry. Also, if you are worried, just declare it.</p>
