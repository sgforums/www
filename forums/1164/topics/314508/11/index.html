              <p>I've served in the coast guard for 10 years.. we hand spliced all out berthing and towing ropes (polypropylene) ourselves (until recently that is)... Prior to that 2 years on board merchant ships as a cadet and for my 3rd class cert and have cut 3inch manila ropes with a plain edged knife with no problem. They are ok with ropes but once they get dull its a pain to resharpen.The cuts on ropes are ragged and sometimes you will find the serrations will bind in the fibres making it more difficult especially if the line is not under load or tensioned.</p>
              <p>A PE on the other hand can still have a toothy edge that cuts rope easily and cleanly. Different strokes for different strokes I guess but IME.... PE is still preferable. I've yet to see many people who are able to resharpen a serrated blade and maintain the shape of the serrations even with gadgets like the Sharpmaker. Even knives from the same maker has variations in serration... My Spydercos for instance, the combo manix has a different serration sixe compared to my endura. Do I use them? Yes, especially if combo edge is the only choice I have like my black coated endura 4 and my spyderco wayne goddard but PE if I have the option.</p>

              <p>Ah, that makes sense. Thanks for the reply. I don't use my knife anywhere near as extensively so the issue of re-sharpening hasn't come up. Still using the same knife for the last 5 years!</p>

              <p>My package from knifeworks has finally arrived! It has been sent to Cantonment road on account of the Heavy Ka-Bar whose blade is 9" long. I pray to God that they dont confiscate it!</p>
              <p>Nephyh: Many thanks for your previous posts about your experiences of ordering online; it was a great help to me!</p>

              <p>Hi guys,</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I was thinking of buying a CRKT Ultima trainer knife from ebay, and it's made of plastic with a 5" blade.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Is it  legal and  allowed to be shipped to Singapore or will the post hold it?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Thanks!</p>

              Hi Nehpyh &amp; Loneriderz 
              
              I am so glad to find knive collectors here !! 
              
              My current few blades I owned are 
              
              1) Spyderco Delica with spyderedge (ATS-55)
              2) Spyderco Harpy (VG-10)
              3) Junglee combo edge ( AUS-10)
              4) Gerber Gator (dunno what steel)
              
              4) Muela Tornado (440C).... a very good and hard knive bought many years in Sngarm, hard used during my NS days and thru out my reservist days. Used it for chopping to make firewood, digging and clearing vegetation. Edge retention quite well, can last more than a week out field, when I feel the edge abit dull, I jus used the gerber diamond sharpener to run few strokes and the blade is back to sharpness
              
              Like to check with u guys, how long does it usually takes the knive to arrive in Singapore everytime u guys ordered online?
              
              I am seriously considering buying direct online to get some cost saving... this hobby really not cheap to sustain hahaha
              
              Also, I appreciate if you guys can kindly share a few of your trust worthy online vendors u usually ordered from, it will really help alot :)

There are expedited shipping but it'll cost more. Better check with respective shop as they may be gilat or simply slack.</p>
