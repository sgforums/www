              <p>Word of advice don.t carry hunting knife outside.Back in 1989 had a folding hunting knife on me at East Coast and got spot checked by a patrol car.As earlier there was a report the SAF personne,using SAF11b, had been involved in a crime at the park.And being from the Navy with SAF 11B,to identify myself,ended up in lockup for 6 hours before got release after comfirming with my buddy back in Naval shipyard the reason for have the knife with me. Got back my knife from the police but decide to have it destoryed as a new blade it landed me in lockup.</p>
              <p>The worst part of the ordeal was I on the way of getting a promotion which fell through as the SAf held it on my personnel folder for six months whereas the Police squashed the case.That also effected my mid year bonus which i did not get with the others on board. Lucky had a good Commanding Officer who fought on my behalf,adding my trip back to Bedok Police Station to get a copy of the report,did I managed to get my bonus in the month of November.</p>
              <p>So if you carry better have a good reason why or end up like me.</p>

              <p>U have to check with them for specifics. But usually these combo edge knives are made using stainless steel, as these steel are easier for machine press. Yet they r strong and resistant to rust, thus requires less maintenance and care compared to carbon steel blades.</p>

              in 2 katana, and now they said its sharp, need to blunt it. Yet my
              previous one was alright...</p>
              <p>Then caesar 1 is ok, when i asked the guy, he said, from what he
              knows, its blunt when it passed thru their a&amp;e
              department.....</p>

              <p>You actually can import in katanas, though the last i checked with ICA and SPF, you would have to get a forwarding agent, listed from TRADExchange, liase with SPF as to whether you meet the requirements to bring in the said items,</p>
              <p>the forwarding agent then applies on your behalf for the permit (will cost you some cash), the services of the forwarding agent/application of permit, will also cost you money. They will also be the ones importing/receiving the item on your behalf....</p>
              <p>as to the collection of the item, i'm not sure, because so far i'm still digging up on the how-tos and the what-to-dos before i bring in that fancy katana i wanna get. Caesers price their katanas up to 500% more than MSRP. </p>
              <p>There's this sword, which i enquired on, sold for 300usd , plus minus a few bucks sold on amazon, ebay and various american dealers , Caesar's selling it for 1.3k. So i'd rather go through the slow and painful hassle of finding out and doing the shipping and permit applications myself than get cutthroat-scalped by a middleman.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Though for now, I'd focus on getting me that Navy Seal Elite i've been eyeing on for my camping trip. Gotta call up SPF soon. </p>
