              <p>Nehpyh, sorry brother. I checked but did not see a PM from you. It must be one of those things. My bad bro.</p>
              <p>Anyway, it's from 1000H to 1600H (Sunday, the 5th). Call the number listed on the Events page. Very cool guys, former operators most and very eager to help:</p>
              <p>http://www.sert-singapore.com.sg/html/sert-sin-events.html</p>
              <p>I know for a fact that they will be showing at least Top Knives, Strider, ZT and Mantis to name a few.</p>
              <p>Man, I must be blind but does one get notified when there's a reply to the thread?</p>
              <p>Thanks guys.</p>

              <p>They didn't confiscate....well it's not illegal to carry knives in singapore, unless the police deems it as an offensive weapon. Now a stool can also be an offensive weapon but I'm not going to debate with the police anytime soon! LOL.</p>

              <p>hello all. it's been such a long time since i've been here that i didn't even know that the layout has changed and that i can't log in using my old sgforums name anymore.</p>
              <p>anyway it's good to be back.</p>
              <p>personally for me, i own 3 - 4 blades which i use for various purposes. i've had them since i was probably 15 and they've never failed me once.</p>
              <p>1. Gerber folding blade first production run, dont know which model. Bought back in 2002 or 3, when i was in an outdoor club.</p>
              <p>very sturdy and for it's size, packs a punch. straight edge (not serrated) and used them from cutting stuff up to opening tin cans (was out sailing and somehow everyone forgot to bring the can opener, so gerber came to the rescue :) )</p>
              <p>2. Ka-bar, black serrated, full sized (11.7" / 7"). bought in late 90s.</p>
              <p>big and bulky, i hardly use it. personally i don't like it, not really worth it's weight. tried to chop some wood and the part where the blade meets the guard bent. it's not full tang and rusts easily. even for it's relatively cheap price, don't bother buying a ka-bar. makes a good gift tho.</p>
              <p>3. leatherman surge, or something which looks like it. given to me by my dad, circa late 90s.</p>
              <p>perfect tool which has never let me down. works wonders when you're at home or in the woods. durable as hell, just needs to be taken care of where the tools are attached to the main body otherwise it will rust and when that happens, it's a bitch to clean. trust me, been there done that. it goes well with my gerber as it makes up for places where the folding blade lacks, and vice versa. the two knives (so to speak) are standard loadout whenever i go out.</p>
              <p>4. Officer's Commissioning Axe, Singapore Civil Defence Force. 2007.</p>
              <p>Never used it but would sure as hell love to chop up some wood with it. :p Comes with a nice leather sheath, so kinda 'sayang' to use it.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Well that's it from me. i apologize for the absence of photos cause i'm actually not living in singapore. when i do, i'll post it up for you guys to see</p>
              <p>have a great week!</p>

              <p><br>Hi hatz,</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Thanks for sharing  :)</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I used to own 2 kabars. Broke one when the leather handle rotted away.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Then I purchased a used kabarfor SGD10 from my Ocifer friend who used it as letter opener. </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Kabar has special meaning to me. It's THE knife since I was a pimply boy scout at age 15 - when Gulf war was all the rage then!</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I must admit the steel rusts like nobody's business but it's generally a good all rounder for the price:</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>1. It's comfy. Due to the leather handle, it's shiok to hold but pain to maintain.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>2. Good balance. It's NOT a 50/50 balanced knife per se but a knife where the blade gives good chopping ratio while keeping it fairly compact and decent handling properties. It's a 'fighting knife' so blade heavy is common.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>3. Edge holding. Easy to sharpen 1096(?) steel. Sharpened edge holds well. Actually, it also depends on how you sharpen la...</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>4. Weight. It's a nice weight to me. Any lighter it can't chop well. One of the lighter 7" blade already. If you like lighter blade, I suggest Falkniven F1 or Ontario RAT3 (D2 steel).</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>5. Durability. Unfortunately, 1096 steel cannot take hard impact - it'll fracture. I strike it with a hammer and after repeated impacts, it broke at the tang. It's a full tang but the tang is not the same width as the blade, thus the weakness there.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Peeps looking to own an all time classic, I'll still recommend it. In fact, the new gen Kabar are tougher, better looking and more value for money.</p>

              <p>Kabar has special meaning to me. It's THE knife since I was a
              pimply boy scout at age 15 - when Gulf war was all the rage
              then!</p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">Same here. Outdoor Activities Club as a CCA back in school and i kinda went overboard with the whole thing. Never looked back since.</span></p>
              <p>2. Good balance. It's NOT a 50/50 balanced knife per se but a
              knife where the blade gives good chopping ratio while keeping it
              fairly compact and decent handling properties. It's a 'fighting
              knife' so blade heavy is common.</p>

              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">dont know about you but mine bent cause it wasnt
              full tang when i pried it hard against something. it's like a bent cock
              now, and i've been wanting to fix it ever since, but i just can't find
              a vice anywhere near me, so whatever i do to it now is fully dedicated
              to oiling it and sharpening the blade, which as you have said, keeps
              well.</span></p>

              <p>I always thought girls will like (now defunct) Buck Paratools more due to its curvy shape and overall nicer handling.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The painful design with SOG is that it opens and expose the edges against your grip. As you apply pressure, it'll 'bite' your fleshy palm. After prolonged usage or handling 'tough nut', my palms will be sore.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Anyway, this argument has its own criticism. Overall, SOG is THE tool since '96 and they still have very good functions not found in other multi-tools.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Thanks for sharing :)</p>

              <p>agreed. they have and always will bite your palms, BUT, it's strong as hell and the problem can be easily avoided if you use it in combination with some cloth.</p>
              <p>do you guys use the leather sheaths that comes with a leatherman or do you have another sheath?</p>
              <p>personally for me i use flap-height-adjustable pistol-mag pouch which i use to store the leatherman and the surefire. this, along with my gerber, perfect combination! (a little heavy though)</p>

              <p>Yea I just love the SOG stuff. Well the Seal Pup is supposed to be multi-purpose to a point, I wouldnt expect it to take on heavy chopping duties! If you ask me, its perfect for um.. combat more than anything else.</p>
              <p>My Pentagon Elite II is the folding one. The mechanism is just so ingenious and smooth its amazing. Only Boker folders feel any smoother, and those feel as smooth as a hot wet and lubed-up you-know-what on a horny girl. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>
