            <div class='col-md body'><p>Hi to Bohemian and everyone on this thread. A very interesting one indeed for knives collection. As there's a very wide scope for different interests in knives collection. I have both the F1 and the Bravo 1 as you have mentioned. I find they are very good blades in their own rights and maybe not so good in some other applications. Perhaps you want to elaborate what do you mean by the 'pack' that they are so much ahead of as you've pointed out. As there are hunters, skinners, survivals, bushcrafts, fighting and combat knives etc to the obvious kitchen knives amount collectors. No offence here, just to stimulate discussions.<img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/set1/smile.png" alt="smile.png"></p></div>

              <p>hi USUBA,</p>
              <p>i'm only interested in knives as tools for camping, hiking or bushcraft. combat and fighting knives don't interest me. skinners are not practical since i don't hunt.</p>
              <p>i got to know the Bravo 1 because of its USMC history but i've been told that the Barkie Gunny is a closer match to the F1. Anyway, I've sent my F1 back to Fallkniven for re-grinding and hope to get it back soon.</p>

              <p>Hello to everyone. I've been following this thread on and off for a while now. Most of my action has been on bladeforums.com (great place BTW)</p>
              <p>I currently have a marvellous collection of 4 "high-end" knives over 2 years. Yeah, being a student doesn't exactly pay well :p</p>
              <p>My collection is as such:</p>
              <p>-Spyderco Delica4 CE. My first one, and the one that got me hooked. I got it from Sngarms for 90 dollars. Quite a good price considering Sheares sells at maybe twice that. It saw lots of use (at scout camps, as EDC) but at the end of the day I just disliked the CE.  Love the steel though.</p>
              <p>-Spyderco Military</p>
              <p>Too damn big for carry, not to mention utterly illegal, but very well built and is my goto outdoors folder (for hiking, camping, cycling trips etc). Love the orange handle. Not so hot about the S30V steel...prefer VG10 as it seems to hold a good edge better.</p>
              <p>-Opinel nr8</p>
              <p>This knife is just awesome. Cheap (20 bucks for me, but can be found for less I think.) sharp, thin and not threatening. One of my fave carries. Thin blade is really really good, and I can sharpen till it can be used to shave better than a disposable razor. (Still too young to have to shave but my classmate used it once as an "emergency" razor. Got top marks from him.</p>
              <p>-Spyderco Gayle Bradley.</p>
              <p>Imagine an Opinel modernised...Heavier, carbon fiber handles, liner lock, CPM M4 blade as opposed to the inexpensive carbon steel on an Opi. Strong and secure, looks great, is comfortable. I blackened the blade with lemon juice and it now looks almost like a coating.</p>
              <p>Trying to get a Spyderco ZDP189 FRN Stretch next. Anyone can help me "proxy buy" off CutleryShoppe btw...I'll pay you MSRP for it (which is still cheaper than Sheares, who charge MSRP in SGD)</p>

              <p>Alijaffri It should be legal, just read the rest of the thread to get a sense of what's what. You may have to be inconvenienced with a run down to the police HQ though.</p>
              <p>KUR1BOH </p>
              <p>Never saw butterflys at Beach Road, did, however, at Queensway mall...nothing to get all too excited about and probably illegal. Unless they were trainers, which they didn't look like. </p>
              <p>Inocencio, Sheares has a nice Becker Necker for eighty bucks. I'd check it out. They also have a few others from Cold Steel ("spike" series or something like that). </p>

Do remember that most prices are in US dollars, and not everything sold there is Singapore-legal. CutleryShoppe is run by a gentleman by the name of Jeff-his prices are good but stock is somewhat limited. Shipping will take a while as well.</p>

              <p>Hi guys,</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I hope you peeps are doing good, being kind and playing safe.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>It's been a long while since I last visited this thread - good to see that it's not locked! I'm just dropping in to see how you guys are holding up.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The recent incidents with all the street gangs really put a dent and tarnish reputation of knife collectors like us. I believe the authority is more careful when dealing with knife handling, imports, etc...</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Because of that, I just wish everyone well and observe the laws and regulations in Singapore. I believe an enthusiast is both passionate and law-abidding.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I do not know what kinda <span style="text-decoration: underline;">weapon</span>s those ah-bengs were using - most likely el cheapo parangs and kitchen knives. I just wish to say this is thread is all about <span style="text-decoration: underline;">outdoor tools.</span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Lastly, a big season's greetings, and here's a link to another interesting knife. Check it out:</p>

              <p>Hi. Anybody knows where I can order knives online or any shop in
              sg which doesnt require IC?</p>
              <p>I'm 20 btw using my brother's account with his permission. Used
              to own a few Gerber, Leatherman and Spyderco knives when I was

              <p>does anyone know if its possible to bring back knives in luggage
              ( checked in ) or the restrictions. I guess i would need to

              <p>It is possible. To be safe, kindly keep your receipt with you. MAKE SURE IT'S IN THE LUGGAGE AND CHECKED IN!</p>

              <p>Hi guys...</p>
              <p>I'm not into forums. But I signed up this form just to join this thread cos of the common interest we have...Knives which we use as tools for outdoor activities.</p>
              <p>I like knives since young...esp those nice looking folder knives.</p>
              <p>I need some good advises here esp from people like nehpyh and Loneridez.</p>
              <p>When odering knives online, the shipping costs are st times riduculous. But some models/brands are not available in Singapore and only online. So is there a cheaper way to go about doing it?</p>
              <p>I am intrerested in a few models esp Kershaw Storm II Plain Edged and Gerber Trend. So anyone knows shops here that sells it?</p>

              Hi guys,just wondering if there is any conditions(age limit?) to buy survival/military knives like SOG and Cold Steel? The reason I am asking is because i am interested to make knife collecting a hobby,but I'm at the wrong age and a right hobby.
              
              Btw,what variety of knives does sheares offer? I'm interested on mainly fixed blades like the SOG SealPup Elite,but also trying to get folding knives for camping/outdoor use.
              
              I'm sorry if I'm kinda troubling you guys,but I have only began to collect knives like a week ago,after buying the SOG SealPup Elite from Black Tactical.

            <div class='col-md body'><p>SempreLetale, about fixed blades, you can consider checking out Sheares Technolgies. They have quite a wide range of folders and fixed blades to choose from. I have a Seal Pup Elite myself. At Sheares, they have SOG, Cold Steel, Spyderco, Benchmade, Blackhawk MOD, Ontario, KaBar, Sheares own brand fixed blade as well, UK and Gerber.</p></div>

              <p>Hi SempreLetale,</p>
              <p>This is a bladdy expensive hobby I must tell you. Esp if you plan to buy knives from local stores here. Cos the prices are being marked up exorbitantly. I personally find the prices crazy. Don't be surprised to see the knives may be sold for only USD70 bucks but here it is being sold for more than $300.</p>
              <p>By the way...if you plan to bring your knives to Ubin for camping, make sure u bring a copy of your proof of purchase. Cos on ur way back to mainland there is a customs scanning and they might stop you. If they do so they will ask for proof of purchase.</p>
