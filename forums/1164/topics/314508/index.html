              <p>in the past, we had our usual M16/AR15 bayonets which were less than useless for actual cutting...</p>

              <p>most of us used our own knives... i had a swiss army knife for everything... the others had scary things like survival knives (Rambo-types) and some even had balisongs...</p>

              <p>Thanks Bear, for your post <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/redones/wink.png" alt="wink.png"></p>
              <p>The std bayonet was/is really a joke at best...but I guess if we were to sharpen it, then it's another story. But for general safety sake during super shag bayonet fighting training, keeping it blunt might be a good thing afterall.</p>
              <p>Yeah, the shiny super non-tactical folder was another boo-boo. Probably some cheapo china mass production with China stainless steel that rust-stain any paper when it was deployed. Definitely a good deadly terrorizing weapon - imagine threatening your enemy with that rusty blade! Or poisoning their water by stiring with it! Thinking about it sends shivers! LOL!!!</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I use a lot of pocket tools during my NS....my oriniginal Buck Tool is still serving me till today....plier, serrated blade, plain blade, +,-screw drivers, etc...one time a koo-koo mate borrowed it to open coconut! WTF, broke it. Luckily Buck did a one-for-one replacement. That's some quality lifetime warranty here. No question asked!</p>
              <p>Lost a SAK (Swiss Army Knife) during my training. Had a Ka-bar but didn't quite use it cos orders then demanded that I bring my bayonet to Brunei. Sianz.</p>

              <p>IMO, it's not a good tool la...except for assasination during WW1 days la....maybe the modern day application would be for mine detection....other than that, it's a fairly unless piece of metal...too fragile, can open cans, can't chop, can't dig self-scrapes, can't cut power cables, and definitely less intimidating during knife fighting...</p>

              <p>Back in NS I stashed my bayonet away and replaced it with a Gerber Mark II, and occasionally used a Cliplock as a boot knife.  I didn't bother with the jack knife and used a Victorinox Huntsman instead.</p>

              Double edged blades are outdated for modern military applications. They are worthless as tools. They are more likely to break. And you will never sharpen one as well as a single edged blade. A double edged blade also limits your attack options. I am very fond of modern tantos such as the Recon Tanto by Cold Steel.

              A modern tanto is sharper, stronger and will easily penetrate objects that would snap a double edged blade.
              
              I am also very fond of the Gerber LMF II Infantry Black

              The Cold Steel SRK is also and excellent duty knife.

              <p>Post some pix of your Stil and Guardian II leh....Although Gerber never attained the status of Benchmade or Spiderco, but the saving on cost is what make somethings attractive...I own a Gerber Ezout folder and although not the smoothest mechanism, the AT34 blade is fairly easy to hone :)</p>

              <p>Double edged blades are outdated for modern military
                              applications. They are worthless as tools. They are more likely to
                              break. And you will never sharpen one as well as a single edged

              <p>Hi Ed,</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I'm always facinated with tanto but read some article that sorta overturn the claim that tanto is 'stronger'...imo, different tool has different purposes and i guess tanto has its place in utility.</p>
              <p>Any difficulty in sharpening it compared to a std blade?</p>
              <p>The LMF2 has definitely garnered raves. Buying it soon?</p>
              <p>The SRK has resemblance of my <a href="http://picasaweb.google.com/nehpyh/Knives/photo#5190089188524612770">Falkniven F1</a> in terms of overall appeal. Great raves too. Do you own one?? How's it working out for you?</p>

              <p>About 12 years ago I was in the knife business. I also use to be a paratrooper so I have some experience with using knives in the field. The Cold Steel Tanto is one of my favourite knives. You can drive one through the hood of a car. In my opinion the Japanese were right on when they combined a chisel point with a thick spine.
                      
                      I usually use a Gatco or Lansky sharpener. While in the field I would carry more than one knife. Rather than carry a sharpener. I have never had any problem sharpening any knife with those types of sharpeners.
                      
                      I like the Gerber LMF2 so much I bought a second one. I prefer the sheath that comes with the infantry incarnation better than the drop down leg sheath on the pilot version.</p>

              <p><br>Actually most knives will pierce ballistic cloth, this is because the knife point tends to push the fibers apart instead of having to break them as you would from a bullet. However if it's a ballistic plate like SAPI or a maximum protection stab vest, then you are unlikely to stab through it unless you have superhuman strength.</p>

            <div class='col-md body'>Like I previously stated. A modern high quality tanto will pierce a metal car body. And is less likely to have problems penetrating through all the other gear that is worn by a modern soldier. Everyone has their favourite I suppose?</div>
