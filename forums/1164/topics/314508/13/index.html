              Thanks for the help,kaapuii and Mr Raymond chew, but my main concern is about whether if shop like sheares allows under 18s to buy knives,as knife collecting don't seemed minor friendly,especially after some idiots took knives and anyhow slash people on street and ruin the name of knives that have been crafted beautifully. If this goes on I think knives like these would be ban in Singapore.

              <p>Dear all,</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>LTNS! It's really nice to see more peeps joining this forum on military/outdoor knives :) </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>First of all, I would like to apologize for not coming to this forum as often as I should - busy with work and other hobbies etc...my bad.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Secondly, the recent spats of slashing cases are really tarnishing knife enthus like us. I maintain that a knife is a tool for decent outdoor sports and not some silly street gang weapon. Street gangs do not use sophisticated (and expensive) tools mentioned here - they use kitchen knives WHICH IS 'SURPRISINGLY' NOT CONTROLLED BY CID! (Then again, how to control kitchen knives????)</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>For new friends joining us, please do not be lazy -  do read through some of the info on import/online/purchase of knives in the earlier posts.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Ok, a little update on myself. My last purchase was a Bravo-1 from Bark River. To me, it's as expensive as I would pay for performance-value ratio. Any other exotic material will have to wait till I strike toto! lol I use my knives so ornamental pieces are not favoured.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Meanwhile, if you have urgent questions on knives, gadgets, outdoor bags, technical gears etc...do follow me on my Twitter @nehpyh. </p>
              <p>Anyway, have a great Chinese Lunar New Year ahead and GXFC!!!! :)</p>

              <p>Hi Dolphindab,</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>You can get a SOG Seal Pup Elite from Sheares Technology at McKenzie Road. I'm not sure of their pricing but I quite sure they are around the same price after factoring shipping charges when purchased online.</p>
              <p>Well at least, you can touch touch the goods before emptying your pocket ;p</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>My buddy uses it for diving ...no, not poking Nemo but as an emergency tool to remove trapped fins from nets and used pad....</p>
              <p>Handle: Glass filled handle is very hardy especially under impact from batoning or simply dropping it...(oops butter fingers!) It has excellent grip during wet and using with gloves on.</p>
              <p>But personally, I find the glass filled handle with scoring lines too rough for bare hand usage - prolonged usage like light batoning and carving can cause light sore/blister if your delicate palms are not seasoned :(</p>
              <p>Also, the handle have grooves for guiding fingers but can be annoying if you have an oblong hand. Ok, jokes aside, the grooves make alternative holding of the knife slightly more difficult than a simple smooth handle shape.</p>
              <p>For the uninitiated, there a few holding methods when handling different tasks :)</p>
              <p>Other small issues are:</p>
              <p>- blade shape and design (pup is more a fighting knife with heritage from its bigger brother.) But when you need to cut something, you cut something...so dun worry too much...</p>
              <p>- blade material. I usually stay away from stainless steel.</p>
              <p>However, SOG Seal Pup Elite still makes a good investment cos:</p>
              <p>1. Stainless steel - less worry but you still NEED to oil and wash away food, blood, seawater etc...(but harder to sharpen)</p>
              <p>2. Very useful and versatile sheath.</p>
              <p>3. Relatively value for money.</p>
              <p>4. Overall good reviews.</p>
              <p>Snap some pics for us when you got it! :)</p>

              <p>Singapore is a 'finance centre'. There is no market big enough for kydex sheath makers to survive! lol</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>You will be better off if you order it online. However, do be ready that custom jobs are not that 'well finished' as our perception. Hand-made stuffs have 'natural inconsistency' so be mentally ready and dun complain like a cheap Sillyporean auntie! lol</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>If you 'have nothing better to do', you can go to junk yard and collect scrape car dashboard. They are made of kydex and you can reheat it to shape it (thermoplastic).</p>

              <p>Hi SempreLetale,</p>
              <p>This is a bladdy expensive hobby I must tell you. Esp if you
                  plan to buy knives from local stores here. Cos the prices are being
                  marked up exorbitantly. I personally find the prices crazy. Don't
                  be surprised to see the knives may be sold for only USD70 bucks but
                  here it is being sold for more than $300.</p>
              <p>By the way...if you plan to bring your knives to Ubin for
                  camping, make sure u bring a copy of your proof of purchase. Cos on
                  ur way back to mainland there is a customs scanning and they might
                  stop you. If they do so they will ask for proof of purchase.</p>

              <p>You can find tanto from Sheares but please check with them on availability. I last saw a Cold Steel tanto there if i remember correctly.</p>
              <p>I have not heard of Dealextreme and I'm not omniscience so do use them with care. I have good experience with www.knifeworks.com. They do not carry all brands but do have all of what I think are good brands.</p>

              <p><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; line-height: normal; font-size: 12px;  "><br>One of the most efficient Spyderco designs to date, the Police Model provides exceptional strength in a slim and comfortable carry. This 'Mariner with a tip' has as much blade as could possibly fit into the handle, with a distinctive grind atop the hollow-ground blade. The large yet ergonomic handle features a secure front lock and a clothing clip for easy accessibility. One of the only Spyderco stainless steel models that is available in PlainEdge (right-hand model only) and left-hand versions (limited quantities for each), this knife is especially well-suited for the heavy daily use typical of law enforcement work. In short, the Police Model does everything a knife needs to do.</span></p>

              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;">Hi Saberlancer,</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;"> </p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;">The folder really look attractive with the 'blackened' tanto-shaped blade. Since it's made of carbon steel, I believe it will last a good while if you take care of it.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;"> </p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;">That said, some people believe that quality and durability comes with a price. Thus, I'm not (always) a brand snob but here are some of the thing you should consider when subcumbing to your 'gears acquisition syndrome'! lol</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;"> </p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;"> </p>
              <ol style="margin-top: 1em; margin-right: 1em; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 2em; padding: 0px;">
              <li style="list-style-type: decimal; list-style-position: outside; list-style-image: initial; padding: 0px; margin: 0px;">Material are not made equal. There is a minimal cost to good material versus seemingly good material. Just like buying fresh orange juice and orange-flavoured juice. They are not the same. Thus, from the carbon steel to the scale (handle) resin, to the metal joints that hold everything together, somewhere/something must be compromised to meet the $8.49 price tag.</li>
              <li style="list-style-type: decimal; list-style-position: outside; list-style-image: initial; padding: 0px; margin: 0px;">R&amp;D is need to improve on ergonomics. If you have been exposing yourself to folders, you will understand that some folders simply have better ergonomics than the other. Thus, a reputable brand does study and users do reviews such thing. And once again, R&amp;D costs money.</li>
              <li style="list-style-type: decimal; list-style-position: outside; list-style-image: initial; padding: 0px; margin: 0px;">When it comes to folder, it's good to look for stainless steel instead of carbon steel because carbon steel requires more maintenance then stainless steel. The main reason is rust. Carbon steel is very suseptible to rust when not taken care of i.e. oiling after every use in wet environment.</li>
              </ol>
              <div style="padding: 0px; margin: 0px;">If you are in Singapore, forget about this folder and look around. Here are some brands begining with the lower price to above average:</div>

              <div style="padding: 0px; margin: 0px;">Gerber is a very good start as it's very affordable, stainless steel, looks sard-sard, etc..you can go to this shop in Chinatown facing CK shopping center. They sell 'old' models at very good price.</div>

              <p>Hi XXX,</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>It's great to hear that you are considering a fixed blade. Before we continue, I just wanna be a nag and say that please be morally upright and responsible. Public's opinion of any form knife carrying is extreme so please be civic minded.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Ok, fixed blade is fun especially when you are outdoor enthusiast as it's more versatile and durable than folder. I fear I'm becoming a brand snob so I'll try my best to be fair to other brands. That said, a tool is a tool and any tool is better than none, and here's a list for your considersation:</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>(In order of price starting with more affordable ones - but i may be wrong with the pricing order)</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>1. Gerber Bear Grylls </p>
              <p><a href="http://www.knifeworks.com/gerberbeargryllsultimatefixedblade.aspx">http://www.knifeworks.com/gerberbeargryllsultimatefixedblade.aspx</a></p>
              <p>I have not used this knife before but the fact that it has Bear Grylls name on it, is good enough for me! lol Sorry for being such as dumb himbo hahaha...but look at the price, it's damn attractive! :)</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>2. Gerber LMF2 </p>
              <p><a href="http://bushcraftbits.wordpress.com/2011/02/24/347/">http://bushcraftbits.wordpress.com/2011/02/24/347/</a></p>
              <p>Also haven't had the chance to use this but I manage to get my hands on it. It's very well-built for the money and there are a few smart enhancement like the holes of spear -lashing, electrical insulation, glass breaker prommel, etc.. that makes it an interesting survival knife. :)</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>3.SOG NW Ranger </p>
              <p><a href="http://www.knifeworks.com/sognwrangerblackkratonhandleplainedge.aspx">http://www.knifeworks.com/sognwrangerblackkratonhandleplainedge.aspx</a></p>
              <p>This is one beautiful and balanced fixed blade. Very nice to handle with the kraton handle. Outstanding SOG quality and comes in nice, thick, leather shealth. Worth considering.</p>

              <p>This has good reviews. If you like scuba diving then this is a good fixed blade that handles it all since it's totally rust resisitant. Other smart perks include the multipurpose sheath where you can cut nets or thin ropes without removing the knife from the shealth. If you are one blur diver who always get stucked in fishing net, or trying to liberlize mermaids, this is the knife for you!</p>

              <p>This knife is well-received by many basically it's well-built and affordable. Also, it has great similarity with Falkniven's ever-popular F1. So if you are not a brand snob, this is a one-off good investment!</p>

              <p>6. Ontario Rat 3/4/5 or Randall RC series </p>

              <p>They are basically the same knife design by Randall but the rumours has it that Randall got dulan with Ontario for sacrificing quality for profit or maybe Ontario wasn't willing to pay Randall enough loyalty...whatever...</p>
              <p>Highly recommended. Compact, sturdy, and highly attractive!!!!</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Ok, I shall stop here cos the price tag starts to get a bit crazy. Also, you can see that I have the propensity to promote 'survival' styled knife cos that's what we all need right? No some wild boar hunting knife or He-Man's sabre! lol</p>
              <p>I'm also recommending knives with around 3 - 5 inch blade. Any bigger, you will look like crocodile Dundee, and a little overkill for short camping trips.</p>
              <p>Short knives have it's drawbacks like cannot effectively chop by swinging - you need to baton instead. That said, baton saves more energy and but I have digressed....lol</p>
              <p>And if you realised, I favour Knifeworks cos their price is right and honest. That said, please read their terms and condition and communicate with an open mind and respect cultural and time difference when dealing.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Enjoy!</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Btw, I can promptly be found on Twitter @nehpyh. Please let me know who you are first cos I have set my account to private.  Cheers!</p>

              <p> </p>
              <p>That said, we dunno how old you are and what kinda training you have received. Mishandling of knives can be VERY DANGEROUS TO YOURSELF AND OTHERS!</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Let's assume you have cleared that above, you are can purchase knives if (but no exclusive):</p>
              <p>1. It's not spring loaded (some called 'automatic')</p>
              <p>2. It's not a ballisong or butterfly knife</p>
              <p>3. It's not a sharpened double-edged</p>
              <p>4. It's blade is not longer than 10".</p>
              <p>Please read the law on imports of knifes throughly or email Singapore Custom for updated info.</p>

              outdoors camping, rope cutting, campcrafts etc. I am open to any
              suggestions or opinions as to which would be better of the
              three,</p>
              <p>I am hoping for a knife that doesn't rust, <span style="color: #3366ff;">generally, knives what won't rust are hard to sharpen easily except for some laminates like Falkniven.  </span>with relatively easy
              maintainance (clean and keep - no need to keep polishing every
              other week ) <span style="color: #3366ff;">There is NO need to polish knives la. Just clean with the water, dry and oil. You dun need to clean it when not using it. You can also wrap your knives in paper or cellophane so that the oil won't get soak up by the leather sheath if it comes with one.</span></p>
              <p>Handy and durable (won't snap under heavy impacts or
              chopping)<span style="color: #3366ff;"> Generally, the harder the knife, the more brittle it is, and easier to break under strong impact. The softer the knife, the easier for it to lose it's edge. There's not two-way about it.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #3366ff;">If you need a lot of strength to chop, learn how to chop correctly, sharpen your knife, use an axe, or choose a softer wood.</span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Durable handle that can withstand the strain from cutting ropes
              or wedging knife between knots and twisting. (bear grylls knives
              had the previous issue of pommells/handle shattering)<span style="color: #3366ff;"> Handles and scales are made from resin and they are not intended for hard usage. Softer handles are for comfort in chopping, grip, heat and electrical resistance.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #3366ff;">If you need to hammer something, make sure the knife has a metal prommel like Kabar. If it's covered with plastic handle, use a rock or anything other object. Hammering with a knife is dangerous too.</span></p>
              <p>I originally considered the Bear Grylls survival knife, but
              after looking through posts from different members i came to notice
              the Gerber LMF infantry black which looked way tactical and cooler
              than the bear grylls series, so DO GIVE ME ANY COMMENTS OR ADVICE!
              I APPRECIATE IT!</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><span style="color: #3366ff;">Knives are like fashion, very subjective. Some prefer utilitarian, some prefer military, while some prefer sat-sat-boh-chio type. What's your preference?</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #3366ff;">There is no one knife that has everything. Knives that has 'everything' are usually Rambo knives that do nothing but look good. </span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #3366ff;">To me, a simple knife is the best. And with that, a RAT-3/4/5, or Falkniven F1, A1, or Bark River Bravo suffice for life. :)</span></p>
