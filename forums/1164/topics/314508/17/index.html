              <p>I've been eyeing this thead for some time now. Some very interesting posts here indeed as well as collections. However, with regards to shipment details, please refrain from going into too much detail on how to import knives.Those who have, would be best to edit your posts.</p>
              <p>Reason being, this is the internet, you do not know who accesses the information. Some young punk having ill-intentions for the knife would be able to import it because you supplied the info too freely. </p>
              <p>Having seen the recent cases of morons who freely cause hurt or brandish their weapons in public like hooligans in the past 3 years. You have to ask yourselves, you're lucky these guys are using unbranded everyday knives you can get from a local store. If in future, they begin using Benchmades, SOGs, Gerbers...etc. The local laws will change, rest assured it will be tougher on the local knife collectors.</p>
              <p>That is not to say, you can't share info, its good to share, but to the right people/crowd. Just be discreet about it, take it to the private message route and best to find out more about the person you share the info with.</p>
              <p>This is just my observation, coming from local sword and knives collectors' community, the long-time members have also voiced similar concerns. Thanks!</p>

              Thanks for the timely advice.  Wise words.  If this impacts on our hobby, then it's just going to be worse in the future.
              
              But as a progression of the hobby, I have started with "making" my own knife.  Not really making, more like starting with an easy knife kit. Interesting experience, but I am encouraged now to continue down this road.
              
              My next project would be a carving set and then my own damascus skinner.  
              
              Anyone else doing this?

              <p>It's true, basically anything with a pointy edge can be used to stab, I got stabbed with a pen before (don't ask how, lol).</p>
              <p>Um, but basically the classic western tanto design (there are modified tanto designs) has a very strong piercing/penetration ability than many other blade shapes.</p>
              <p>In terms of combat usage, if you need to stab through thick protection, say kevlar. Then yes, personally I prefer my tanto-shaped blades because they do their job well and the thickness of the blade helps it maintain its strength during knife-fights.</p>
              <p>However, that is not to say other knife shapes aren't 'combat-ready', there are many combat knives that have a good combination of slicing ability and chopping ability, but do not fare that well in stabbing. Different uses, each design has its pros and cons and it really boils down to preference and situation.</p>

              <p>hello people, new to this forrum. </p>
              <p>Just wanna clarify a few of my doubts and hoping that this thread is not dead, i shall try.</p>
              <p>#1 doubt: If i purchase a knife from ebay/amazon, is it legal for it to be imported into singapore? I am just afraid that when the knife is being sent to my address, the police may arrest me . (imma pussy)</p>
              <p>#2 doubt: I've been following this forum for quite some time now and some experienced people make it sound so easy to just purchase the knifes over the internet. I am not saying i susspect that it is fake, i'm just wondering is it THAT EASY ?</p>
              <p>I hope this goes through to anybody who is reading this and is willing to clarify my susspicions and doubts . Cheers :) </p>

              <p>Hi guys, i'm thinking to add a neck knife to my collection. My
                      last purchase was a survival Ontario Rat 5. Are neck knives legal?
                      I'm thinking to get this one.</p>

              <p>Yea, it's fine! There isn't a law against neck knives, but of course you don't wear the thing in public or you'll definitely be asking for trouble when spotted by our gentlemen in blue.</p>
              <p>I already have these : <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Heckler-Benchmade-Tactical-Snody-Instigator/dp/B003E16XCG">http://www.amazon.com/Heckler-Benchmade-Tactical-Snody-Instigator/dp/B003E16XCG</a></p>
              <p>So no problem as the designs are very similar. Though I wouldn't use my Instigator as neck knife, more of a backup knife during military combat scenarios. I can't classify it as a combat knife because the blade is too thin and won't take schock well.</p>

              <p>Hi CasperV, no, my Instigator is single edge. The Cold Steel's Double Agent Knife is also single edge as far as I can tell. What makes you say it is double edge? O.o</p>
              <p>Haha, I really don't know how to explain it any simpler other than that double edge knives have 2 sharpened edges. Very common on daggers, bayonets, relatively straight knives (example: http://www.amazon.com/Elk-Ridge-Double-Hollow-ground/dp/B0044EGYV2/ref=sr_1_3?s=sporting-goods&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1338130622&amp;sr=1-3 ), but I'm guessing that its not very common on a highly curved blade because honestly in my rational and personal opinion, it doesn't make sense to put 2 edges on a high-curve blade. That is not to say they don't exist though, sometimes you might get a full length sharpened edge on one side of the knife and a short sharpened edged on the other side. Or a plain edge on one side and a serrated edge on the other side. Or even comibnations. Examples: http://www.nauticexpo.com/prod/tigullio-dive/double-edged-diving-knives-26532-151281.html and http://216.38.63.83/products/index.php?id=1766 .</p>
              <p>Hope that clarifies your question. With respect to double-edge knives, I also heard many many times from friends/people (exclude those who aren't knife collectors) that the double-edged knives are illegal. Problem is....I've searched high and low for a written law/statement saying so, but cant find it. Yet I've seen some local shops (I won't mention), carrying double edge knives.</p>
              <p>Hmm...so yea. This area is really in the grey.</p>

            <div class='col-md body'><p>It's in the arms and explosive act that daggers are prohibited. And from what i know, AEBs differentiate knives and daggers by whether it is single or double edged. Single edged = knife, Double edged = dagger. So ANY knife with double edges are considered daggers and since daggers are prohibited, so are double edged knives. <br>Usually when i go down ICA collect my parcel the officer will lightly touch the rear of the blade near the tip of my fixed blades to see if it's sharp... <br>My friend told me that knives with short runs of serrated edges on the spine but doesnt go near the tip is allowed. I'm not sure about this though, neither am i interested in this style of knives.</p></div>
