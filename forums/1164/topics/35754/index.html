            <div class='col-md body'>i was wondering where did s'pore buy it's sigint plane[s]? the aircraft is a fokker but what about the "electronic equipment" inside??? or did s'pore buy the plane &amp; built the electronic gear together themselves?</div>

Other than that I don't know, although depth charges seem to be a holdover from another era (as opposed to guided AS torps) so thats unlikely don't you think?</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>yep, you need a very large number of depth charges for any effect. . .and err, even if the Fokker can carry a torpedo, how does it locate them, does it carry sonar buoys too?  and does singapore use any helicopter in a partial naval role currently? no, rite?</div>

It can use the FLIR to detect the diesel exhaust fumes from the snorkel, or use the maritime search radar to detect periscope masts. It they carry magnetic anomaly field detection equipments,  they could also detect the submerged submarines. However, they still lack acoustic detections as they currently do not deploy sonar bouys.<br><br>They are probably fed enemy submarines location by the RSN ships via datalink and fly to the proximity and drop the Torps. I cannot confirm but this would be a logic thingy to do and a common ASW tactics.</div>
