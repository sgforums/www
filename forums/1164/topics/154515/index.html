            <div class='col-md body'>Majorities of the Jap garrison tropps in SE Asia on 1944-1945 are not their best units. A lot of elite Jap forces are tied down in pacific war esp at Okinawa and Iwo Jima. In addition, many of the Jap in the elite Jap unit in Burma were down due to malaria and dengre fever. Jap also faced critical supplies issues at SE Asia, esp towards the mid 1944.<br><br>The lost of the Jap sea supremecy at Pacific Occean, had resulted in the success of USN operations aginst the Jap supply ships. It had disrupted the material flows, and reduced the industrial output for Jap war effort. It was noted that the last Jap Carrier Shinano had taken a much longer time to build due to the shortage of materials and skilled labours.<br><br>In addition, the british and the elite units from Nationalist china had managed to recover from the earlier defeats in Burma. The China war front had been unfavourable for Jap since the 1943. The Jap offensives into nationalist china heartland were repeatedly repulsed by the chinese. The chinese communist had also present a threat at the occupied chinese terriorities.<br><br>Jap was unlikely to hold out against an British frontal assault, should Lord Louis Mountbatten decided to push the jap out of malaya and singaporean in late 1945.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>There was indeed a military operation called Zipper that was commanded by Lord Louis Mountbatten.  Had the bomb not fallen, Operation Zipper would have been an amphibious invasion on the east coast of Malaya, with a large naval and air support.  What will happen then would forever be a "what-if" scenario. It was converted to Operation Tiderace after the Japanese surrendered.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>The Jap garrisoned in Malaya and Sg are not the elite division. The Jap air assets and naval assets were all tied up in Okinawa and Iwo Jima. The jap best crack troops werestationed in Burma to guard against British,  in fact, these cracked Jap troops were supposed to conduct the invasion of India together with the INA (Indian National Army). However, their attacks into India had been repulsed by British and suffered from heavy loss.<br><br>As I mentioned before, Jap soldier in FIBU was deadly but not formible nor unstoppable. In the defence in Sg, the Chinese resistance corp and Malay regiments had proven that Jap are not as formible as it seems. In fact, these local units were defeated due to lack of equipments and training. The reason that Jap was able to defeat british was simply because british were not as determined to fight as compare to the Jap. It was widely known that Jap army was running low on supplies in the last days of the Invasion of Singapore, the Jap soldiers even had to ration their ammunitions in the field and cut down on their meals during the seize phase of Singapore city. The loss of Singapore in WW2 was more due to the the poor leadership of the local british commander, and lack of determination / preparation in the British armies in malaya.<br><br>During the 1944-1945, British / Chinese invasion forces had destroyed much of the backbone of the Jap Army in Burma. In fact, Jap soldiers had to fled away and being chased by the British. After the re-taken of Burma in 1945, most elite Jap units were ordered to pull back into Japan mainland for the ultimate battle with the US invaders. The only Jap crack troops stationed outside Jap mainland was the 100K strong KwangTong Jun in Manuchia / North China. Later, the KwangTong Jun was also beaten like sh#t by the invading Russian armoured thurst.  You can see that Malaya and Sg was rather empty, running very low on supplies. Even if the local Jap resisted, british were not expected to face off with most eilte Jap in malaya and Sg.<br><br></div>
