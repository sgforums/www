            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by akula:</div><div class="quote_body">I feel that the Leopards are definitely a good potential. British made the mistake that tanks are not suitable here. am wondering if our SAF is making a similar mistake by thinking that heavy MBT has no place here. Tempest..... no one I know off ever seen them. do they exist in the first place. If they do exist means SAF do believe in them. All the more should try getting those Leopards. Apache can't be all the time around with the front guys.</div></blockquote>I dun think the British has made a mistake becos you will talking abt many countries making the same mistakes. I have compiled a list of countries that has mostly tropical rain forest namely from SEA &amp; South America:<br><br>Argentina-----TAM         30 tons<br>Venezuela----AMX-30    36 tons<br>Cambodia-----T-54/55    36 tons<br>Vietnam--------T-54/55   36 tons   <strong>T-62   40 tons</strong><br>Thailand-------Type69    37 tons    <strong>M48A5   49 tons   M60A3  53 tons</strong><br>Malaysia-------<strong>PT-91       46 tons</strong><br>Singapore-----<strong>Tempest   52 tons</strong><br><br>As you can see from the list above, most countries from the regions I mentioned do not operate MBTmostly light tanks.<br>Even they operate them, they r generally below 40 tons. Those above 40 tons are also mostly small in number except for Vietnam(200 T-62s) &amp; Thailand(175 M48s &amp; 53 M60s) &amp; maybe even SG.<br><br>The point is there is no example of a conventional warfare operating 40+ tons MBT in the past for us to gauge it's effectiveness in rain forest terrain. The lower the weight, the lower ground pressure which mean better cross country mobility but lesser firepower &amp; armour protection. The opposite is say for the heavy tanks.<br><br>Therefore light tanks(below 25 tons), medium tanks(25-40 tons) &amp; current crop of heavy tanks(40-60+ tons) , their effectiveness is everybody guess.<br><br>But as the region is getting more &amp; more urbanised, it is certainly good to have some MBT with u.<br><br>As for whether there are any Tempests in the SAF, Yes,they have.<br>I know where they r &amp; I have been there.</div>

However, the way they cross are slightly different. The Russian would deploy snorkels, not very different from those of the submarines to draw air into the tank compartment and for the engine, and release exhause fumes.  The German and the French use large tubes for the tank commanders to crawl on top to navigate as well as to draw air into the tank, somewhat like a conning tower.<br><br>Anyway, I wouldn't like to be one of the people inside a fully submerged tank.<br><br>Back to the topic about Leo2A6, I still think it is quite an impossible ask to get them. I can think of how SAF would justify the implications, both militarily and politically to acquire a Leo2A6. In any case, if SAF is to get an MBT, I would rather see Lelerc or a dieted Mekarva Baz 3 with some Mekarva 4 features. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br></div>

But not true also that heavy tanks are not tested in the tropical. A good example is the China, vietnam war in 1979. Chinese moved heavy armoured units over the thought impassable jungle valley of pan she gu to surprise Lang Son. Surprising the defenders with tanks appearing out of the jungle. Lang Son falls in 2 to 3 days under heavy armoured assault.<br><br>In fact China captures (Lang Son, Lao Cai, ha Giang, Cao Bang, Dong Ke, That Ke, and Mon Cai) in just a short span of 20+ days.<br>Though chinese not quite win over the vietnamese.<br><br>It is a great show of armour capabilities in the tropicals.<br>http://www.china-defense.com/history/sino-vn_1/sino-vn_1-1.html<br>Picture on the first page shows that heavy armour is used in vietnam when china fought vietnam.<br><br>China had T-62s (41 ton) and T54/55 (37 ton) respectively, so did the vietnamese then.

BTW, I think the Centurions chassis could be converted into AVLB or SP Arty platforms. Our good friend even converted some into armoured personal carriers and call them Pumas.<br><br>BTW, SAF always seems to get second hand MBTs. I hope the SM1 light tank replacement will be a totally new design with the latest sights (IR and NV), advanced 105mm gun or low recoil 120mm and perhaps even active protection suites like the IR and Laser warners and jammers. The new replacement should be able to perform SM1 traditional roles plus knock out some of the latest East European tanks (No rewards for guessing what I am getting at) <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Typhoon is right. We have something that is so good that i think will spark fear and outrage in the regional countries when it is finally announced. Its also a beauty!I wonder why we don't declare officially our MBTs when the Malaysians acquire some already, i mean at least the older Tempests. Because Singapore usually will announce or declare to have certain equiptment after the neighbours have gotten theirs. This is done as to not start an arms race. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"></div>

For one thing, it won't be able to go to as many places as the SM1. Also, sometimes direct fire support happens from higher ground. I wonder if this 'rumor' can depress as well as SM1?<br><br>But this 'rumor' is a great MBT! Just not a right fit in the ABG though I suspect?</div>
