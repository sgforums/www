That is why the Merkava mark1 has similar track as the Centurion.<br><br><span class="large"><strong><span style="color: darkred;">CHARGE!!!</span></strong></span><br><img src="http://www.amatorce.de/Mehmet.gif"><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Time to roll out the Tempest for National Day parade, don't you think? Probably have to put it on a transporter........<br><br>Understand that the Tempest has been upgraded before and now features solid state electronics, thermal sights, electric drive turrets with stabilisation......so the first hit prob. has increased by alot. New Merkava tracks too.<br><br>Tempest maybe still too 'new' to be displayed publicly. Though power train maybe long in the tooth because of the added weight of armour added......<br><br>Turret also added many more smoke dischargers and other devices......like this post!<br><br>I think it started out looking like a SHOT but now it is BIG as before.</div>
