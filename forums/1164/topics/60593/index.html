            <div class='col-md body'>The Leopard 2s is so popular, u could almost call it the de-facto tank of Europe. Spain ,Greece &amp; Poland have ordered and getting the Leopard 2 in the next few year.<br><br>Therefore, it is quite unlikely the SAF could get their hands on it even they r selling, most probably they will go to another NATO country.They r also quite heavy, weight almost 62 tons, that means SAF need to upgrade most of our bridging equipment to handle it.<br><br>One thing to note, the Polish is getting rid of their PT-91s replacing it with Leopard 2A4. So you could imagine how the Leopard 2A6 could handle the MAF's PT-91.</div>

Gross weight</strong><br>This is the gross weight of the tank.  Why does it matter? It matters because the SAF combat engineers do not have quick launch bridges that are rated to carry anything above 30 tons.<br>Ref: <a href="http://www.army-technology.com/contractors/engineering/man/" rel="nofollow">http://www.army-technology.com/contractors/engineering/man/</a><br><img src="http://www.army-technology.com/contractors/engineering/man/man4.html"><br><br>SAF would need to invest on MLC60 or MLC70 class bridges to cater for a 60 tons and above MBTs. &lt;- lots of additional funds will need to be allocated just to support MBTs.<br><br><strong>Note</strong>: I am not sure what the M60 AVLB bridge ratings is, so I cannot comment on that<br><br><strong>2.  Footprint, or pressure on ground</strong><br>This determines how much pressure per inch (or it is square inch) the tank track or tyre puts on the ground. This will determine how well a tank will be able to move around soft grounds, eg. snow or mud. The Bv206 and  Bronco are the two armoured vehicles that have the lowest pressure, while the Mekarva and some other MBTs have the highest.<br><br><strong>3. Physical size</strong><br>The heavier a tank, the bigger the physica size - usually. A big tank is going to get bogged down in jungle warfare easily. They are better suited for urban, desert or open plain warfare where the chances of getting hit by enemies are big and thus heavy armoured are needed to protect the crew and give the tank the greatest possible survivability.<br><br>I hope this helps.</div>

Gross weight</strong><br>This is the gross weight of the tank.  Why does it matter? It matters because the SAF combat engineers do not have quick launch bridges that are rated to carry anything above 30 tons.<br>Ref: <a href="http://www.army-technology.com/contractors/engineering/man/" rel="nofollow">http://www.army-technology.com/contractors/engineering/man/</a><br><img src="http://www.army-technology.com/contractors/engineering/man/man4.html"><br><br>SAF would need to invest on MLC60 or MLC70 class bridges to cater for a 60 tons and above MBTs. &lt;- lots of additional funds will need to be allocated just to support MBTs.[/b]</blockquote>That right. SAF need to new equipment to support  tanks of more than 60 tons &amp; it must be support by AVLB for its mobility, Current AVLB we have is the M60 AVLB which is class 60 &amp; AMX-13AVLB which is I think is only class 30, in this case we need at least a class 70 AVLBs.<br>Oher Bridging equipment which are mentioned by someone is simply not mobile enough to support the Leopards. Armoured Engineers r suppose to travel with the new tanks to be effective.<br><br>Note: The Centurion MK13 is only 52 ton,the upgraded one should only add another one or two tons. Therefore Class 60 is sufficient.<br><br><blockquote>Originally posted by Joe Black:<br><strong><br><br>[b]3. Physical size</strong><br>The heavier a tank, the bigger the physica size - usually. A big tank is going to get bogged down in jungle warfare easily. They are better suited for urban, desert or open plain warfare where the chances of getting hit by enemies are big and thus heavy armoured are needed to protect the crew and give the tank the greatest possible survivability.<br><br>I hope this helps.[/b]</blockquote>Good point too. One of the criteria for the initial design of the Scorpion family was that the width of the vehicle must be small enough to squeeze thru between two rubber trees in a rubber plantation found in MY.(The British still has a large force in SEA then)</div>

They r there to ensure that the armoured forces are not slow down by any natural or man made obstacles that is why they should have the same mobility as the armoured forces they support &amp; has quick laying &amp; recovery of bridge to be effective.<br><br>Since the current AVLB we have only a class 60, it could not support the Leopards which is 62tons, unless there is new class of AVLB that I am not aware of.<br><br>It is true that larger river will need special bridging equipment for the armoured force to cross but they r also slower in term of deployment &amp; they r usually planned for since large river will not suddenly appear but tank ditches do.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I feel that the Leopards are definitely a good potential. British made the mistake that tanks are not suitable here. am wondering if our SAF is making a similar mistake by thinking that heavy MBT has no place here. Tempest..... no one I know off ever seen them. do they exist in the first place. If they do exist means SAF do believe in them. All the more should try getting those Leopards.
