            </div>
            <div class='col-md body'>Was wondering, how would the police/SOF react in the event of a Hostage or Terrorist situation involving a bus. As we know, a bus is basically a rectangular shaped container with seats and wheels. Personally feel that the level of technical difficulty is much higher then that of say...an aircraft,building or ship.As the space constraint is more so on a bus and the number of shooters able to be in the bus when the shooting begins is way lesser.So if lets say someone hijacks one of them and threatens to blow it up or start killing people if their demands are not met and STAR/SOF &amp; CBRE responds.<br><br>Have read in foreign magazines/books and saw videos that the British SAS basically will swarm the bus from one side or from both the front and back. Primary weapon being that of the handgun for fear of over penetration. While a containment is setup around the site, snipers may be called in to deploy around the bus while negotations are carried out. But of course, what we are interested in is when the word "Go" is transmitted over the radios.<br><br>The magazines say that from "Go" assault teams already in position will move tactically towards the bus, while the Snipers may be tasked to take out visible suspects/tangos. Once in position, the assault teams will put ladders in place, break the windows with hooligan tools and throw in flashbangs.Once those go off, in the window they go and the shooting begins.<br><br>However, as I take a double-deck bus to school almost every morning, I wonder how is it possible to do a double decker take down? Have yet to seen any feasible way of raiding a double-deck bus full of hostages and tangos.<br>Please share if you have any info, if OPSEC is of concern, pls.pm.Thanks!</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Theres something like tactical ladders for such assault.  Basically stair cases on wheels.  Assault teams would ride in on those.<br><br>Bus is a difficult situation. Extremely tight quarters, and chances of shooting civilians is high.  Snipers would have to really eyeball out the terrorists really well.  Chances are, shooters might have to take out the terrorist BEFORE the assault team moves in to clear out.  Multiple shooters mind u, to make sure the bugger STAYS dead.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>As the bus upper structure is mainly glass (well in SG).  It may be eaiser to just shoot perps.  Care should be taken as the bullets after going through the glass may be deviated.<br><br>If there is a need to physically storm the bus, there were previous instances and photos were published in ST.  Sorry can't remember which country.<br><br>IIRC the basic idea is attempt entry on every window using ladders.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>But one thing which really bothers me is this, in a bus or double-decker, you only have this much space. So if the assaulters swarm from the front and rear, won't they risk a blue-on-blue?And yes, i agree they are highly trained, but accidents do happen.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Entrance from the rear of the double-decker bus can be done by smashing the rear-windows. Although there are some buses which do not have a rear-window. Thus, assault team might have to smash the front windows and initiate the assault from there then.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Domestic hostage rescue (buses) should be the domain of STAR right? I've seen their land rovers with ladders all the time. As STAR has training attachments with Hong Kong's SDU, I'm very sure its been practised many times before.<br><br><a href="http://www.spf.gov.sg/about_spf/star/index.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.spf.gov.sg/about_spf/star/index.htm</a><br><br>It seems that STAR has maritime assualt and diving teams as well.
