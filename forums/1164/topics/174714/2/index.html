            <div class='col-md body'>Ultimately, when such a crisis arises, the main objective of the assault teams be it Military of Law Enforcement would be to ensure minimal casualties. Think that the bus is one of the toughest environments to do a tango take-down.<br><br>Also, the very fact that the ability of the operating unit to react to the given situation is also very much a high factor in determining the mission's success or failure. Someone mentioned that being in a bus, it would be easy to end the situation by simply immobilizing the bus and then laying seige to it, however, I doubt that this will work.<br><br>A bus scenario offers no place for the assaulters board it discreetly and also its a confined place, unlike that of an airliner. The Tangos and Assaulters have much more room to move about as compared to in a bus. Also by laying seige over a long period, it increases the possibility of Stockholm Syndrome, and also serves to agitate the hostage-takers more which may result in deaths of the hostage as the Tangos are in a confined space and are more irritable compared to being in a larger environment.<br><br>Feel that in such a scenario, the most important is that of speed and decisive action. 4 Land Rovers with step ladders behind driving towards the bus , box it.Two at the front and back, both perpendicular and ramming the bus to get make the Tangos lose their footing and two by the side with assaulters launching Flashbangs into the buildings immediately, before swarming it and taking the Tangos down.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>chances or storming is near to none. U gotta either exhaust the terrorist psychologically or prepare bodybags for the hostages. Most terrorists will know u have snipers and will try to use hostages as shield and unless ur sniper is like super power.. what if got 5 terrors ? What if got bombs ? how ? U dun know got bombs ...<br><br>i say just be prepared to assume the worst. No negotiations with terrorists. U blow the hostages up with the Terrors. End game. Both side kena WIN LOSE situation.. 50/50. So not bad.</div>
