            <div class='col-md body'>In the Jan 2004 issue of the Pioneer magazine, there is an small section on the 3rd battalion,Singapore Guards on stand-by duty over the New Year holidays. There are 2 photos included. I noticed that the helmet which was worn is not the usual one which we wear. Firstly there is no camoflage netting on the helmet. Secondly, there seems to be something sticking out in front of the helmet and resembles that of a one of attachment for NVD. Thirdly, the helmet have a more shiny surface(as seen from the reflection of sunlight)as compared to the standard helmet.Does it means that its made of a new material such as composites as opposed to kevlar? One of my friends said that this is a special helmet to be worn for FIBUA operations. This means that one of the missions of the Guards is to enage the enemy in urban environment. Can anyone confirm this?<br>Another point to bring up is that ,i notice a case on the floor on the parade ground in the photo on the right. I guess its a ATGM,most likely to be the Milan.Can anyone confirm this? Thanks <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>yes, "elite" units usually get the best stuff right?<br><br>No, the case is WAY too small to be any kind of ATGM, not to mention even a LAW of some kind. The case on the ground is a "Pelican" case.<br><br>Pelican cases are favored by cameramen and video guys to keep their stuff, so I'd guess it's some kind of optical instrument.<br><br>Notice the case is near the guy who is wearing the jungle hat. Only BRCs wear jungle hat. Scouts like to wear them only when no one is looking.<br><br>Following this deduction, it's no doubt that it's some kind of death ray laser weapon. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz"><br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by tankee1981:</div><div class="quote_body">In the Jan 2004 issue of the Pioneer magazine, there is an small section on the 3rd battalion,Singapore Guards on stand-by duty over the New Year holidays.

            <div class='col-md body'>I don't think those are new helmets. In fact, I think they are old ones - the matt finishing on the helmets are worn out and may look shiny under sunlight. New helmets have a matt finishing. The attachment is for night vision equipment and can be used with existing helmets. Don't know why they remove the camo netting on their helmets.<br>The case contains a night vision sight - used by scouts\snipers\84mm crews, etc. or anyone else needing it.<br>I've used all the stuff shown in the picture during my in-camp trainings - its just standard stuff.<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by tankee1981:</div><div class="quote_body">In the Jan 2004 issue of the Pioneer magazine, there is an small section on the 3rd battalion,Singapore Guards on stand-by duty over the New Year holidays.

            <div class='col-md body'>I have that "new" helmet".  Or rather the first generation cock up version of it.<br><br>Basically, there is not difference from the old helmets u have.  Just that there is a chin strap thing, extra padding for comfort.  Which is not bad.<br><br>But here is the cock part.<br><br>The Chin strap is attached to the main strap with 2 snap buckle.  Like those we see in commercial bags.  So basically, there are 2 5mm thick buckles on ur left n right cheek.  Its easy to wear and remove, just snap them together, and squeeze them to release.<br><br>Sounds good right? But why is it cock?  Because there are 2 thick buckles located beside the cheek.  How are u gonna rest ur cheek on ur rifle butt properly? Esp firing "zero" weapons like M-16?  Basically, its uncomfortable and it changes the natural position of the eye on the weapon.<br><br>The 2nd generation of this helmet had the RIGHT side buckle removed, and it is now a strap with no buckles... But what about the left handers?<br><br>Our officers tell us that these "new" equipment were QCed by ADF as they would be one of the first to recieve and test new equipment.  I don't think they put a lot of effort to QC these new chin strap buckles.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I am aware of the helmet with the improved chin strap,but if i am not wrong even if the camo netting is removed the helmet will not be shiny. This is because the helmet surface is rough and thus can't reflect light. Another point to note is that almost all the helmets in the picture is reflecting light,therefore i don't think its the effect of being worn out. The helmet some how have a plastic look to it,sort of like the helmets worn by the Delta force in the movie Black Hawk Down. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"></div>
