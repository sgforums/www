Ten are currently in service after the retirement of the USS Enterprise, which is due to be replaced in 2017 with the USS Gerald Ford, the first of a new class of "big decks."</span><br style="font-family: Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 11px; line-height: 14.296875px;"><br style="font-family: Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 11px; line-height: 14.296875px;"><span style="font-family: Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 11px; line-height: 14.296875px;">The new carrier carries a prohibitive pricetag of $13.6 billion, double the cost of the last aircraft carrier. And that does not count the $4.7 billion spent on research and development for the new class of carriers.</span><br style="font-family: Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 11px; line-height: 14.296875px;"><br style="font-family: Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 11px; line-height: 14.296875px;"><span style="font-family: Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 11px; line-height: 14.296875px;">It costs about $6.5 million a day to operate a single carrier strike group, which includes five other warships, an attack submarine, an air wing of 80 fighters and helicopters, and a crew of 6,700.</span><br style="font-family: Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 11px; line-height: 14.296875px;"><br style="font-family: Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 11px; line-height: 14.296875px;"><span style="font-family: Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 11px; line-height: 14.296875px;">But Hendrix maintains the return on the investment is paltry.</span><br style="font-family: Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 11px; line-height: 14.296875px;"><br style="font-family: Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 11px; line-height: 14.296875px;"><span style="font-family: Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 11px; line-height: 14.296875px;">Each F/A-18 fighter in the carrier fleet has dropped roughly 16 bombs in 10 years of war, which works out to about $7.5 million for each bomb when all the costs of the aircraft are taken into account.</span><br style="font-family: Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 11px; line-height: 14.296875px;"><br style="font-family: Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 11px; line-height: 14.296875px;"><span style="font-family: Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 11px; line-height: 14.296875px;">That compares to the cost of firing a Tomahawk cruise missile, at about $2 million each. And five naval destroyers armed with Tomahawks cost only $10 billion to build and $1.8 million a day to operate, Hendrix said.</span><br style="font-family: Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 11px; line-height: 14.296875px;"><br style="font-family: Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 11px; line-height: 14.296875px;"><span style="font-family: Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 11px; line-height: 14.296875px;">Apart from the mushrooming cost, carriers are facing mounting dangers from increasingly sophisticated ship-killing missiles, skeptics say.</span><br style="font-family: Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 11px; line-height: 14.296875px;"><br style="font-family: Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 11px; line-height: 14.296875px;"><span style="font-family: Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 11px; line-height: 14.296875px;">US strategists are fixated on China's DF-21D missile, which they fear could potentially knock out a carrier and deprive the American fleet of its dominance on the high seas.</span><br style="font-family: Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 11px; line-height: 14.296875px;"><br style="font-family: Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 11px; line-height: 14.296875px;"><span style="font-family: Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 11px; line-height: 14.296875px;">Former Pentagon chief Robert Gates cited the anti-ship missiles and other hi-tech weapons in a speech in 2010 in which he questioned whether it was worth spending billions on more carriers.</span><br style="font-family: Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 11px; line-height: 14.296875px;"><br style="font-family: Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 11px; line-height: 14.296875px;"><span style="font-family: Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 11px; line-height: 14.296875px;">"Do we really need 11 carrier strike groups for another 30 years when no other country has more than one?"

But he added: "The US Navy is very aware of this and has plans to deal with it."</span><br style="font-family: Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 11px; line-height: 14.296875px;"><br style="font-family: Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 11px; line-height: 14.296875px;"><span style="font-family: Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 11px; line-height: 14.296875px;">The cost of the carriers had to be compared with the huge funding required to protect and supply air bases and troops on land, as illustrated by the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, he said.</span><br style="font-family: Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 11px; line-height: 14.296875px;"><br style="font-family: Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 11px; line-height: 14.296875px;"><span style="font-family: Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 11px; line-height: 14.296875px;">And the carriers could be ordered in without the political strain associated with a drawn-out ground war.</span><br style="font-family: Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 11px; line-height: 14.296875px;"><br style="font-family: Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 11px; line-height: 14.296875px;"><span style="font-family: Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 11px; line-height: 14.296875px;">"The American people are very wary of commitments ashore, there's no appetite to go in and have a ten-year presence in some place," said Daly.</span><br style="font-family: Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 11px; line-height: 14.296875px;"><br style="font-family: Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 11px; line-height: 14.296875px;"><span style="font-family: Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 11px; line-height: 14.296875px;">"Here you have a force that can go to a location, deal with a task ahead and then leave quickly or stay as long as it needs to.

                  <p>
                  It is true that nowadays carriers "may not be able to move close enough to target to operate effectively or survive in an era of satellite imagery and long-range precision strike missile"  - but this is not because of carrier is obsolete - but more of a reflect of the navy choice of aircrafts !!!  That is because of the very limited range of F-18, , unlike F-14 thus carrier have to move closer, also cannot project its force further and will come within reach of the anti-ship missile.

              <p>And that's after one fought a decade long war with USA, and the

              <p>Look further than the carriers.</p>
              <p>USA and Japan's FDI have also been used to hedge against China's
              increasing economic hegemony.</p>
              <p>Look at how Cambodia had done at China's bidding to disrupt the
              recent ASEAN summit.</p>

              If one accepts the argument that one shouldn't build a ship as it can be sunk, then no country in the world should have a navy.

              <p>US balancing the power of China? I think it is the other way round, US got 11 carriers, China just got 1 miserable one that is not operationally ready yet. It will take a long time for China to balance the power of the US. But they will do it.</p>
              <p>guess we should go back to the questions, do the US still need 11 carriers? it all depends on what they want to do with it. Cold war is over, colonies have all become independent. The major threats to nations, especially countries like the US, come from terrorists, and carriers have limited use against terrorists. They have the money, they do what they like.</p>

              <h2>China as peacemaker</h2>

              <p>Nuclear escalation on the Korean Peninsula demands creative 
              solutions. With a 2,200-year history of non-aggression, China is in the 
              best position to take the lead — and relieve the United States of a 
              burden it has shouldered for too long.</p>
              <p>In fact, no other nation  has had as stable a pattern of world 
              citizenship. Over two millennia, China has not attempted to conquer its 
              neighbors or spread its system of government on any scale remotely 
              comparable to the Romans, Mongols, British, Germans, French, Spanish, 
              Russians, Japanese or even Americans. China does brutally resist the 
              secession of Tibet, which it considers part of its ancient patrimony. 
              But it has not grasped for lands beyond its historical borders.</p>
              <p>There is no reason to think the Middle Kingdom has merely been biding
               its time. Indeed, if any nation can be said to have a long-term 
              strategy, it is China. Premier Zhou Enlai, when asked what he thought of
               the French Revolution of 1789, allegedly replied, “It’s too soon to 
              tell.”</p>
              <p>China
               also has a 2,200-year record of authoritarian rule. Even so, it has 
              become steadily more open — at its own glacial pace. China’s government 
              is more responsive to its people now than it was under the Han, Ming or 
              Qing dynasties, ending in 1911. After a long period of civil war in the 
              first half of the 20th century, worsened by a brutal Japanese 
              occupation, the dictator Mao Zedong restored order.</p>
              <p>Since 1979, the repressive government has slowly provided more 
              freedoms to its 1.3 billion citizens — beginning with what President 
              Franklin D. Roosevelt called “freedom from want.” Today, the Chinese 
              people are freer to save, accumulate, conduct business and travel abroad
               than perhaps at any other time in China’s 2,200-year history as a 
              coherent state.</p>
              <p>Pundits and professional worriers tend to paint China as a burgeoning
               military threat. This is a serious misinterpretation of a very long 
              track record that includes the peaceful re-annexation of British Hong 
              Kong and continuing restraint toward Taiwan (lost first to the Japanese,
               and then as a result of civil war). Unjustified suspicions blind 
              policymakers to important security options at a volatile time in 
              Northeast Asia.</p>
              <p>Like pioneers of yore, we need to read the trail to understand where China is headed and how we might ease its path.</p>
              <p>For centuries, China was the economic powerhouse of the globe. As Adam Smith, author of <em>The Wealth of Nations</em><span style="text-decoration: underline;">,</span> commented in 1776, “China is a much richer country than any part of 
              Europe.” Today, more than anything else, the ancient nation wants to be 
              rich again — though in ways that do not leave commoners mired in 
              squalor, as before. Its commercial policies are aggressive, but it is 
              not territorially expansive. China understands that physical conquest — 
              as Japan’s World War II experience proved — can undermine economic 
              success in the modern world.</p>
              <p>Instead,
               to achieve its goals, China needs regional peace and stability. It has a
               far greater stake in capitalist South Korea’s health and happiness than
               even the United States, which has guaranteed Seoul’s safety for the 
              past 60 years as part of its campaign to stop the worldwide spread of 
              communism — a task now completed.</p>
              <p>South Korean companies such as Samsung are among the world’s largest 
              producers of semiconductors, the electronic chips that nourish 
              everything in the electronic food chain from toys to automobiles. 
              Semiconductors are key to economic growth around the globe.</p>
              <p>Though China’s manufacturing base has gone viral, it does not make 
              these precious chips in any significant amount — partly because foreign 
              investors won’t set up shop, given the lax enforcement of 
              intellectual-property rights. China depends heavily on imported 
              semiconductors, for which its best and closest suppliers are South Korea
               and Taiwan.</p>
              <p>Semiconductor plants require <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/05/04/realestate/commercial/04chips.html?_r=1&amp;">enormous investment</a>;
               a single factory costs $6 billion or more. They are geese, laying 
              golden eggs. The last thing China wants is a nuclear or conventional war
               between its immediate neighbors that might destroy this <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/05/04/realestate/commercial/04chips.html?_r=1&amp;">industrial infrastructure</a>.
               Li Baodong, China’s envoy to the United Nations, said as much in early 
              March, after the last round of sanctions against North Korea to 
              discourage Kim Jong-Un’s nuclear ambitions. “We are formally committed,”
               Li insisted, “to safeguarding peace and stability on the Korean 
              Peninsula.”</p>
              <p>This statement is of critical importance to Washington, which should 
              do everything possible to encourage China to take on the role of 
              peacemaker and enforcer. The United States has played bad cop in 
              relation to North Korea for six decades. We still have 28,500 troops on 
              the ground in a war without end.</p>
              <p>An armistice brought the three-year civil war between North and South
               to a temporary halt in 1953. The peace treaty, however, never followed.</p>
              <p>Modern world history shows that Band-Aids need to come off for 
              healing to happen — despite the sting. Japan’s recovery after World War 
              II was delayed for six years, until the allied countries finally agreed 
              to sign a peace treaty in 1951. Thirty years after the surrender of Nazi
               Germany, the Helsinki Accords of 1975 formally established peace in 
              Europe. The accords reduced tensions across the continent and eventually
               led to the end of the Cold War.</p>
              <p>The 60-year delay in formally ending the Korean War has had costly repercussions. No <a href="https://www.un.org/en/peacekeeping/operations/principles.shtml">blue-helmeted U.N. troops patrol the demilitarized zone</a>,
               as in other post-conflict areas, to keep peace once it’s been 
              established. Instead, the United States has borne the expensive military
               burden of enforcing another country’s day-to-day defense for six 
              decades — enabling South Korea to democratize and flourish.</p>
              <p>In addition to straining our national budget, this commitment has bought us animosity on both sides of the 38<sup>th</sup> parallel. A survey of South Korean military cadets in 2004 found that more <a href="http://www.koreatimes.co.kr/www/news/nation/2008/04/116_22029.html">ranked the United States as the “country’s main enemy”</a> than ranked North Korea as the primary threat. Young Americans who 
              teach English in Seoul find signs at some restaurants saying, “No 
              Foreigners Allowed.”</p>
              <p>If not an example of the axiom “No good deed goes unpunished,” these 
              reactions may belong in the category of nationalist responses to the <a href="http://www.koreatimes.co.kr/www/news/nation/2008/04/116_22029.html">long-term presence of foreigners</a> — regardless of how helpful they may be.</p>
              <p>A former graduate student at San Diego State University, where I 
              teach, recalls liking the cookies that friendly U.S. soldiers brought to
               the South Korean orphanage where he was raised in the 1980s. But he 
              also remembers being mystified as to why the “white men” were there. 
              It’s a question the majority of Americans might have a hard time 
              answering, given that the U.S. commitment predates their birth.</p>
              <p>The United States has given South Korea more in the way of shelter 
              than any competitive nation-state has given another in perhaps all world
               history. But this effort has hit a point of diminishing returns for 
              everyone involved.</p>
              <p>More of the same promises little in the way of progress. It’s time 
              for China to become umpire and peacemaker of the region, consistent with
               its historical record and modern aspirations.</p>
              <p>The 60th anniversary of the Korean Armistice is July 27, 2013. Let’s 
              celebrate with a peace treaty that allows Washington to bring our troops
               home for good.</p>

              So... dragg....
              
              Is South Korea on the border of China? Or North Korea?
              
              The author seems confused. Why talk about China and a peace treaty when it is North Korea that a peace treaty is needed with? Unless North Korea is secretly a province of the People's Republic. And do you even think North Korea is even receptive to a peace treaty or can be relied on to keep to one? North Korea is a cult religion on a country wide scale, and those are never known for their rationality. China can play peacemaker all it wants, but unless that "God want to be" is removed from NK, doubt even China will get anywhere.
