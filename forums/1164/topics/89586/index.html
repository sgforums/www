To get into the BRC, it depends on your intake. If one of the companies are gonna ORD soon, the Bde S2 will go "hunting" for more victims in BMTC ie. give talks on how glamorous it is to join BRC and so on so forth.

            <div class='col-md body'>Ok guess now's the time for me to step in.<br><br>I just got my jungle hat recently, so I figure I am in a good position to tell you my experience. I am a battalion scout. Essentially, this is a platoon of scouts. The structure is like this:<br><br>2 commanders, 1 signaler, a basher and a driver<br><br>The ratio of commanders to troopers is 2:3 (very high, guarantee that you will know your commanders inside out by the time your course ends)<br><br>The scout platoon is under the S2 (Intelligence branch)<br><br>It all started back in my BMT, when suddenly one of the instructors asked me and two more guys to fall in. It happened that we were going to be interviewed by some unit to be scouts.<br><br>The scout PS and (for my case) S4 came to do the interview. Here's the lowdown on what they told me:<br>1) Nobody to disturb you outfield (essentially, it is your team alone out there, and as long as you deliever the goods, they won't disturb you)<br>2) Physical training is like hell, but very satisfactory<br>3) You will be cool (Jungle hat, no more helmet, except for live firing, and for sitting in the jeep)<br>4) You will handle cool expensive gadgets (like the NVG, etc...)<br><br>Ok... the response was not very good (they did the interview en-mass), but I was among the few who put their names down. Those who didn't ended up inside the platoon with me anyway... (talk about <strong>options</strong> <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"> )<br><br>Then when I reported to the unit, we did advanced infantry training. That meant more section movement drills, and the lot. Then came the nice part.<br><br>Vehicle course. The PS picked, from the whole platoon, 8 people to go for the motorbike course. The rest went to the jeep course. Those who went to the motorbike course would end up as signalers... (and I am one of the 8...) The course was stay-out, which meant I could go home everyday and drool  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br>After getting the bike licence, we went for the ISPC (Infantry Scout Platoon Course), where we were split into our teams and did training together. It was plenty of fun, and tough too. We had MOI (Memory of Information) which required us to do A LOT of PT before memorising a picture. Then they would ask us questions about the pictures. Get it wrong, and its ONE MORE TIME...  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"><br><br>We also had infiltration training, amongst which included doing all sorts of crawls, in the mud (the instructors gleefully poured water to make the thing even more muddy). My team was among the last few ones to start the thing and the whole path by then looked like it was a mini canal... Needless to say, we emerged looking like a Plaster of Paris.<br><br>We also had to do everything in full battle order. Not the normal one mind you, we had even more stuff inside, not unlike the NDP goodie bag. Stuff ranges from wire cutters, to flags... The signaler also has the heaviest field pack, because he has to carry the darned signal set, with batteries everywhere, and is usually the last one to put his field pack down.<br><br>All in all, the course was tiring, but plenty of fun. In fact, the PS commented that the whole platoon was just plain out of our minds (which is quite true, if you hear the amount of crap we talk each time we have nothing to do)<br><br>Anyway, the course ended with a 8 day summary exercise, and a trip up to Elephant hill for the jungle hat presentation ceremony. Actually, I have photos of it, see my blog (http://pkchukiss.blogspot.com) for some of it.<br><br>I heard that to qualify to be a scout, you need to have a certain amount of security clearance, something which even now I don't understand...<br><br>And I am PES B, only just passed my IPPT and SOC. Go figure.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Geez... for BRC I am not that sure, but this is what I do know:<br><br>1) BRC has one person to a bike, but scouts have two signalers on a bike, and the rest on the jeep. (That means 2 teams to a bike)<br><br>2) BRC is dispatched earlier than the scouts, and they cover a wider area (walk more), and are more "General" based than scouts.</div>
