            <div class='col-md body'>Yup totally agre,no way can M'sia keep up to the logistical demands of continuous MLRS strike since each UNGUIDED rocket cost a million.SAF could use weapons like Tomahawk Cruise missiles,or if we decide to purchase the Rafale or EuroFighter Typhoon combat aircraft,they can be equipped with  StormShadow cruise missiles which are more pin-point and can clearly define a target to within a few feet.Besides weapons systems such as MLRS are usually used just to scare the balls off the enemy.MAke the troops lose confidence as they are disoriented by the sheer onslaught of metal raining down on them.As such,SAF should instead get precision weapons instead of blanket weapons.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>i think SAF should get some super long range MLRS...<br>^^<br>preferably get the arrow system used by israel<br><br>Just thinking that Malaysia could get alot of Armour and technology<br>and advanced weaponry and fighter upgrades if it allies with Israel<br>and be more friendly with the US and European instead of criticising<br>and go more with pro-US policies..actually helps in defense matters ...<br>...<br><br>if the ASTROs which malaysia is using...could be countered by ARROW<br>wahahahahahha<br><br>maybe a arrow system which splits up in mid air ...(saw it in C&amp;C tiberium strike) and engage all the missiles simultaneously</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>U sure anti-missile will be effective against mlrs rockets? these are area saturation weapons, just like any other arty piece.  most (affordable) mlrs rockets are unguided and meant to be fired in salvos, not one by one such that u can counter with anti missile systems...<br><br>another prob with mlrs is that if singapore get it, they'll prob need an all-regular unit to man it.  with the high cost of each rocket, we can let NSmen shoot it for practice all the time!! they are smarter ways even if u just wanna bankrupt the treasury...<br>(but it doesnt cost a million lah, tens of thousands more likely, even harpoon with all its guidance and stuff is a few hundred thousand each)<br><br>and yep there are shore based antiship missiles.  just go do a google search... like i said, i'm a no-experience person, so if i mention some arms or munitions, its quite definite that it can be found on google!! <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"></div>
