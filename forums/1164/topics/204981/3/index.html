Yes it would be hell but HEY - it's war!!!<br><br>We read courageious people give up when they are down to their last round of ammo, or everyone's dead or dying...etc.<br><br>But Percival was not lacking manpower,  ammunition, and no one is dying of thirst or hunger.<br><br>THEY JUST SIMPLY GAVE UP!!!<br><br>There was not one Singaporean - military or civvy -  who tried to persuade the British against fighting the Japs in order to spare Singapore from further destruction. I think most Singaporeans had a pretty good idea what the Japs will do once they arrive. So it was preferable to fight or die trying - like Lt Adnan &amp; Lim Bo Seng - than to be butchered helplessly as a surrendered people.<br><br>That's why I think Percival deserved a court martial. His incompetence tarnished the image of the "angmo" forever.<br><br>But again, like I said, his decision to surrender must have had the agreement of London, which is why he wasn't tried so that other VIPs in London won't be implicated in the debacle.</div></blockquote>Then why the big shock that Churchill had after the surrender? Somebody  doing stuff behind their bosses' back?</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>It's easy to lynch somebody with 20/20 hindsight, but when you are there on the ground things may not be so clear.<br><br>I think Percival was more of a victim of the system, and much of history has been unfairly blamed on him. He was working within the limitations of the British doctrine on fighting in asia back then, and it could be argued that had he been given more space to order the battle about unhindered, the Japanese would have seen quite another thing when they tried for asia.<br><br>In any case I don't think he was under the impression that the battle was winnable at that point of time, he has no idea of the true Japanese situtation and thought that there was plenty more where that came from.<br><br>So from his point of at that time, the Japanese could not be held off with any meaningful kind of resolution. They had air superiority, were beating his troops at almost every turn, and there seemed to be no resolution in resistance except extensive damage to Singapore and her people.<br><br>The Brits had gravely underestimated their Japanese opponents and once that happened they lost even an ability to get a proper idea of what they were really up against. It almost certainly was that after realizing they had underestimated their opponents... they ended up overestimating them.<br><br>In surrendering Singapore Percival was (from his view of things) choosing the lesser of the two evils. He didn't think that the battle could be won and further resistance would be futile and cost prehaps the needless loss of all life. While there were able bodied men that could fight, Percival had to think of all the women, children and others that would have nowhere to run had the battle raged on.<br><br>Of course, now we know that if he had held out and re-orged, trying to hold the Japanese out for just a few more days, he might have gotten a surprise in that the fighting ability of the Japanese would have been drastically reduced. But of course he never got to that point, for the Japanese commander made his bluff and he believed it.<br><br>But he didn't have any reason not to disbelieve that the Japanese would win. He had no intelligence on the real state of the Japanese supplies and numbers, and the way the battle was going then seemed to all point in the way of a Japanese ability to fight and win.</div>
