            <div class='col-md body'>Well, it's true that a lot of Chinese and European prisoners did suffer, but many also survived too. And don't forget the other races, such as the Malays, who were largely left alone, and the Indians, who were given a chance to join the Indian National Army and hopefully elude the Japanese grasp later.<br><br>Anyway, all these and what have seen said here regarding what happened after the surrender is with the benefit of hindsight. With Percival's limited knowledge of Japanese intentions and culture at that time, I don't think he could've predicted with any degree of usefulness what the Japanese would do after he'd handed Singapore over to them. I believe the foremost consideration in his mind as a military commander would have been to save his troops from sacrificing themselves to what was to him a lost cause. Hence I consider his surrender a humane decision but not cowardly.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Well, you can't say bad things to General Percival. I remember taht my History teacher wold me that Percival had alrady enticipated that an attack from the north very well early in the war. He suggested to the British superoirs in UK that more troops should be place to form a "wall" in Malaya. But the seniors in UK thought that such a plan would not be possible. The superiors thought that the Japanese would attack from the south VIA Sentosa as the Japanese "could not fight in the dense jungles of Malaya". Therefore, they built four powerful forts in Sentosa.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>The forts were built way before WW2. In fact, the defences were in progress right after Singapore was accquired as a trading port of the British. Most were built during the late 1800s and upgraded over the years. There is indeed a strong defence towards to south. But alas! The Japanese strolled right in from the North.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mad.gif" alt="Mad" title="Mad"><br><br>1) The guns did face inland to impede the Japanese advancement.<br>2) Most rounds used were not anti-personal but rather armour-piercing to sink vessels.<br>3) With no air support, the guns were like sitting ducks to aerial bombardments.<br><br>A well-written site describing the guns and its role played during the fall of Singapore.<br><br>http://www.fortsiloso.com/history/1919.htm<br></div>

He led the defence and succeeded in holding Verdun against the German onslaught in one of the fiercest battles of the war, and he revived French morale and fighting spirit after the mutiny of 1917 by showing genuine concern for the welfare of his soldiers. His subsequent collaboration with the Nazis had more to do with his personality rather than any actual belief or endorsement of Nazi ideology. Petain was a staunch patriot and possessed a somewhat melancholic character, and his military skills were geared more towards conservation and defence rather than attack and conquest. When the Nazis broke the power of the French army with Operation Sichelschnitt, Petain believed that the only way for the French Republic to continue in existence was through collaboration with Hitler, and hence he agreed to become the head of the Vichy. This I believed stemmed more from his patriotism than from any belief in Nazism, and so I think we should not see Petain in such a bad light as some others have made him out to be.<br><br>If you are interested, you can try reading Corelli Barnett's <span style="font-style: italic;">The Swordbearers</span>, which has a good deal of material on Petain during WWI.</div>

Fighting a war of attrition is a thing that they were very poor at doing.<br><br>But losing the battle of Singapore (assuming they have taken Malaya) might have other bearings on them.

Following a devestating defeat, Winston Churchill is removed from power and Lord Halifax becomes Prime Minster. Subsequently, Lord Halifax brokers a peace deal between GB and Germany.

Hitler felt that the British were fellow Aryans. In fact, he very much wanted to sue for peace with them. In Mein Kampf, it was written that he wanted to form alliances with them. So a British-Nazi peace treaty would not be hard to imagine.</div>

I've always believed that even if the Axis Power won, it would be an inevitable that both powers go to war with each other.

Yes it would be hell but HEY - it's war!!!<br><br>We read courageious people give up when they are down to their last round of ammo, or everyone's dead or dying...etc.<br><br>But Percival was not lacking manpower,  ammunition, and no one is dying of thirst or hunger.<br><br>THEY JUST SIMPLY GAVE UP!!!<br><br>There was not one Singaporean - military or civvy -  who tried to persuade the British against fighting the Japs in order to spare Singapore from further destruction. I think most Singaporeans had a pretty good idea what the Japs will do once they arrive. So it was preferable to fight or die trying - like Lt Adnan &amp; Lim Bo Seng - than to be butchered helplessly as a surrendered people.<br><br>That's why I think Percival deserved a court martial. His incompetence tarnished the image of the "angmo" forever.<br><br>But again, like I said, his decision to surrender must have had the agreement of London, which is why he wasn't tried so that other VIPs in London won't be implicated in the debacle.</div>
