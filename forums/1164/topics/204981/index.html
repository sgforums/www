He thought it was the "humane" thing to do.<br><br>This act of weakness condemned thousands of his surrendered troops to a slow, cruel death.<br><br>This cowardly act also sent thousands of ethnic Chinese to their death when Japs massacred Chinese men in their Sook Ching operations. For the next 3 years, people lived in fear and terror.<br><br>If he had no men or ammunition then I can understand surrender. But in both he had plenty and was not in shortage except for arty and anti-tank. But the Japs used their tanks poorly. So you can't even attribute their success completely to tanks. And what little anti-tank guns the Allies had they used to good effect as the Japs stupidly sent their tanks forward to fight alone without infantry support. And the tanks kept mostly to the roads as the jungle was impenetrable even to their light tanks. One gun alone knocked out something like 6 tanks as they came round a bend one by one.<br><br>And during the fight down the peninsula, it was mostly a jungle war, so Jap air superiority is great but shouldn't affect the outcome so much.<br><br>It was the Jap infantry that sent the Allies packing.<br><br>It was also a sheer lack of wills, plus a complete misunderstanding of what "surrendering" means. The Allies thought at worst they'll be sun burnt playing cricket and drinking tea behind barbed wire guarded by quaint yellow soldiers.<br><br>If they had understood that surrendering to the Japs just meant you die slower (e.g. the "Death Railway" ) they'd probably fight instead of surrender.

            <div class='col-md body'>The key behind Japan's success was Intelligence, Espionage.<br><br>Japanese intelligence &amp; espionage activities were traced as far back as the 1930s.  Malaya was well infiltrated, providing the Japs with vital information.<br><br>Ibrahim bin Haji Ya'acob a journalist for Warta Malaya, cum recruiter for KMM, passed important information regarding suitable landing places in Kota bahru, British troop dispositions as well as locations of fortifications along the Perak River to the japanese.<br><br>Colonel Kadomatsu Tsungunori, worked undercover at the Officer's Club in Singapore's Naval base, and was speculated to have discovered the arrival of Prince of Wales, a month before the Japanese attack came!<br><br>Besides gathering of information, the Japanese were able to manipulate the Indian  Independence league to carry out subversive actions that weakened the force defending singapore signficantly.  Indian troops comprised of 49% of the combined Brit, Oz, Nz, commonwealth troops defending Singapore.<br><br>Operational deception or British folly?  Operation Matador was a plan to strike into Thailand to secure Singora and Patani on the East Coast of thailand, where the Brits believed the Japanese will land.  British intelligence efforts was centred around Matador, and troops spent most of their time preparing for it. Unfortunately, the Japs landed on Kota Bahru as well.  Perhaps due to lack of preparations, the Brits were unable to react and switch to a defensive posture which pretty much spelt the collapse of the British front in Northern Malaya.<br><br>By the time the Japanese reached Singapore, desertion rate was very high.  Indian army troops were subverted over to the Indian National Army.  An example being the 12th Indian Brigade, within a span of 3 days, it was reduced to just 70 men.  High rate of desertion, lack of air support, poor leadership, inappropriate training, poor quality of some reinforcements, 2 mths of retreat, absence of tanks... all contributed to the low troop morale of island defenders.<br><br>IMO, replicating the same conditions, Singapore could not have been held.  Even if Percival had not surrendered totally and officially, there would have been little fighting instead, individual units surrendering on their own accord.<br><br>Acknowledgements: Far Eastern File by Peter Elphick where most of the information was researched from.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I feel Percival (the Rabbit) did a cowardly thing and not humane thing by surrendering.  Maybe he thinks he and the rest of the ang mo soldiers will be deported back &amp; enjoy easy life behind the prison camps. Maybe he feel gutted by the lack of support from his UK towkays.<br><br>Whatever it is, the fiercest battles in Singaproe was fought by the locals -at Bt Timah, at Pasir Panjang, etc.  And all these were with weapons so much inferior to what the British have.   I din recall reading any fierce battle fought by the British in Singapore - the closest was the Australians at Slim River (in Malaya).<br><br>Well, at it is, some of the ang mo were sent to build the Death Railways and the locals (who were left behind, who couldn't actively particpate in the defense of their nation) had to suffer the brunt of the occoupation.<br><br>I think the name Rabbit did suit him, he froze in front of Yamash|ta's face and signed Singapore in for 3 yr plus of sh|t.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I would say yes.<br><br>If Percival had shown far more resolve and had more intelligence on Japanese plans, manpower and supply situation I would say that Singapore might have been held.<br><br>Yamas<strong></strong>hita himself had been highly hesistant about invading the Singapore city itself. In his own words, he feared that it would go down to a deadly war of attrition in the streets, which the British might well win since they had superiority in numbers (the Brits had 84,000 troops, while the Jap forces were 30,000 strong). In addition, as someone pointed out, Yamas<strong></strong>hita's own supply lines were severely strained and couldn't last long.<br><br>Percival himself made a lot of dubious decisions in the fighting. For example, when the Japs were fighting down the Malay peninsula, he didn't even order the digging of trenches and fortifications on Singapore's northern coast - ostensibly because it was bad for morale.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>But of course, we must consider the other side of the coin - if Percival were to convert Singapore into another Stalingrad, it sure as heck would have caused the escalation of civillian casualties.</div>

In his own words, he feared that it would go down to a deadly war of attrition in the streets, which the British might well win since they had superiority in numbers (the Brits had 84,000 troops, while the Jap forces were 30,000 strong). In addition, as someone pointed out, Yamas<strong></strong>hita's own supply lines were severely strained and couldn't last long.<br><br>Percival himself made a lot of dubious decisions in the fighting. For example, when the Japs were fighting down the Malay peninsula, he didn't even order the digging of trenches and fortifications on Singapore's northern coast - ostensibly because it was bad for morale.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>But of course, we must consider the other side of the coin - if Percival were to convert Singapore into another Stalingrad, it sure as heck would have caused the escalation of civillian casualties.[/b]</blockquote>Percival could have had all the intelligence he needed if they had people actually SPOKE Japanese on staff.  Ref: British 18th Division, Intelligence section.<br><br>Yamash|ta was right to fear urban combat, knowing that he had lesser lives to throw into such a grinder. Unfortunately, Percival didn't know that.  55 days of fighting Malaya, only a dozen prisoners were taken back for interrogation?  Could interrogation of MORE prisoners have yielded important information regarding the strength of Japanese forces in Malaya?  It showed that the British forces didn't quite care to interrogate prisoners and shot them to avoid the trouble, OR they did not engage in patrols to capture prisoners in the first place.<br><br>And yes, maybe digging trenches would have decreased morale.  But morale was already pathetically low anyways.  Desertion was in the THOUSANDS, and the perimeter line was thin as a thread.  My guess is Percival felt that if he ordered the trench digging, his thin line would desert him anyways.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>The issue of the surrender being a humanitarian issue, is too a dubious one. Would one say that Singapore suffered less casualities during that 3 years and the accompanying Sook Ching than if it really came to house-to-house fighting? I'm guessing that urban fighting would definately result in less casualities as presumably the fighting would be concentrated around the developed areas of Singapore,leaving the areas further east like Changi alone.</div>
