One thing to take note, the Northing and Easting reading are in 5 digits each, YYYYY, XXXXX, the first X and Y from the LEFT side is redundant in singapore terrain, so read the 2nd numbers onwards.<br><br>I belive the 1st digits are for our geography region(not too sure abt that). As for the compass bearing, you can have a choice of MILS, or degrees,. In the settings page, u can set the bearings to  degrees or MILS, distance in terms of miles, km. Distance from pre set destination, distance to destination, num of paces ( you need to calibrate it to your pacing), estimated time of arrival based on current speed in mins or hours or both. There is a hell lot of preference you can set in the GPS.<br><br>When u move, i normally use the digital compass which points in the direction of your pre-set destination.<br><br>But don't bet on it to work in the jungle, the folioage in LCK is too thick to get the GPS signals, areads with thin foliage is alright, if your in Marsiling, sometimes can receive. usually it to confirm ground and location.</div>

However, you will have to reprogram your GPS unit when overseas; this will involve changing the Datum, etc.<br><br>It should be noted that civilian GPS units have a certain amount of inaccuracy built into them.

Well as for the inaccuracy  which unit did u use ? I used the Garmin Etrax Venture, and i borrowed the Scout PC's GPS unit to confirm, same reading on the MGRS.</div>

I don't think the shops still sell the GPS 12 model ? or do they ? the Etrax is gd, small light and snudge fit ...it fits just nice into the SBO, or one of the Tanaka handphone pouch i bought for the purpose.think the topic should be renamed "Which GARMIN GPS to buy ?"<br><br>Anyone out there own a Megellan GPS ? any reasons for their high retail price ? i initially wanted to buy one of the Megellan, but i was turned off by the high price.
