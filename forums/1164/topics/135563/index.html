            <div class='col-md body'>F-14 TOMCAT STANDARD FLEET FIGHTER AIRCRAFT, USA<br><br>The F-14 Tomcat is the US Navy's carrier-based two-seat air defence, intercept, strike and reconnaissance aircraft. The aircraft was developed by Northrop Grumman to replace the F-4 Phantom fighter and entered service with the US Navy in 1972. In 1987, the F-14B with an upgraded engine went into production. Further upgrades in the radar, avionics and missile capability resulted in the F-14D Super Tomcat, which first flew in 1988. The US Navy operated 338 F-14 aircraft of all three variants, but the aircraft is being replaced by the F/A-18E/F Super Hornet. F-14 squadrons have started to change to the new aircraft; this process will continue until the aircraft is finally retired from service in 2007.<br><br>The variable sweep wing and the twin almost upright tail fins of the F-14 Tomcat give the aircraft its distinctive appearance. The variable sweep wings are set at 20Â° for take-off, loitering and landing, and automatically change to a maximum sweep of 68Â°, which reduces drag for high subsonic to supersonic speeds. The wings are swept at 75Â° for aircraft carrier stowage.<br><br>COCKPIT<br><br>Catseye night-vision goggles have been installed in the F-14 since 1996 and are supplied by BAE SYSTEMS. The F-14D front cockpit is equipped with a head-up display and two multifunction flat-screen displays. The rear cockpit for the Radar Intercept Officer is equipped with a display that presents fused data from the AN/APG-71 radar and from the suite of aircraft sensors.<br><br>82 US Navy F-14Bs are being upgraded with Flight Visions, Inc. Sparrow Hawk HUD and FV-3000 modular mission display system, which will improve reliability and night-vision capability. The cockpit is equipped with the NACES zero/zero ejection seat supplied by Martin Baker Aircraft Company.<br><br>WEAPONS<br><br>The F-14 is armed with a General Electric Vulcan M61A-1 20mm gun with 675 rounds of ammunition, which is mounted internally in the forward section of the fuselage on the port side. The aircraft has eight hardpoints for carrying ordnance: four on the fuselage and two each side under the fixed section of the wings. The aircraft can carry the short-, medium- and long-range air-to-air missiles AIM-9, AIM-7 and AIM-54, and air-to-ground ordnance including the Rockeye bomb and CBU cluster bombs. Raytheon AIM-7 Sparrow is a medium-range radar-guided air-to-air missile with range of 45km. Lockheed Martin/Raytheon AIM-9 Sidewinder is a short-range air-to-air missile with a range of 8km. Raytheon AIM-54 Phoenix is a long-range air-to-air missile with a range of 150km. The F-14 can carry up to six Phoenix missiles and is capable of firing the missiles almost simultaneously at six different targets. The Phoenix missile was retired from US Navy service in October 2004.<br><br>The F-14D can carry four Joint Direct Attack Munitions (JDAM). First operational deployment of a precision-guided JDAM from an F-14 was in March 2003.<br><br>In 1995, the US Navy installed the Lockheed Martin LANTIRN precision strike navigation and targeting pod on the F-14. The LANTIRN targeting pod includes a dual-field-of-view FLIR and a laser designator/rangefinder. The navigation pod also contains a FLIR and terrain-following radar. A Lockheed Martin infrared search and track system is installed in a sensor pod under the nose.<br><br>SENSORS<br><br>The F-14D is equipped with a Raytheon AN/APG-71 digital multi-mode radar, which provides non-cooperative target identification, and incorporates low sidelobe techniques and enhanced frequency agility.<br><br>The F-14 carries a tactical air reconnaissance pod system (TARPS), which carries a Recon/Optical KS-87B forward or vertical frame camera, and a low-altitude panoramic view KA-99 camera, together with a Lockheed Martin AN/AAD-5 infrared linescanner. The pod is equipped with a digital imaging system for the transmission of near real-time imagery to the aircraft carrier command centre via a secure UHF radio data link. To supplement TARPS, US Navy F-14s are also being fitted with a fast tactical imagery (FTI) system, which is a line-of-sight system for targeting and reconnaissance.<br><br>COUNTERMEASURES<br><br>The aircraft is equipped with the BAE Systems Integrated Defense Solutions (formerly Tracor) and Lockheed Martin AN/ALE-39 and AN/ALE-29 chaff, flare and decoy dispensers. The Super Tomcat has a Raytheon AN/ALR-67(V)4 radar warning system and BAE Systems Information &amp; Electronic Warfare Systems (IEWS) (formerly Sanders) AN/ALQ-126 jammer.<br><br>ENGINE<br><br>The F-14B and the F-14D have two General Electric F110-GE-400 turbofan engines, rated at 72kN and 120kN with afterburn. There are five internal fuel tanks, which carry 9,000 litres and are located in the fixed section and the outer section of the wings, and in the rear section of the fuselage between the engines.<br><br><a href="http://www.airforce-technology.com/projects/f14/images/tomcat4.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://www.airforce-technology.com/projects/f14/images/tomcat4.jpg</a><br><a href="http://www.airforce-technology.com/projects/f14/images/tomcat3.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://www.airforce-technology.com/projects/f14/images/tomcat3.jpg</a></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>The engines are placed in an unusual position, they are parallel, hence there is large amount of space for fuel between engines. Hence its long range, coupled with AIM-54s, the total strike range is damn big!<img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_eek.gif" alt="Shocked" title="Shocked"><br>Another advantage of this arrangement is that the F-14 can bank at about 60degrees! Most fighetrs would have fallen out of the sky if they tried to sustain that banking.<img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"><br>In my opinion, the F-14 is the ultimate plane. Built in 1970s, designed for the future.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>As for the AIM-54 Pheonix missile;<br>the AIM-54 Pheonix missile was retired because it was becoming obsolete. The missile was designed to shoot down Soviet bombers such as the Badger, Bear &amp; Backfire from long range.<br><br>However, because of it's long range design there were trade-offs. It was huge in size (and has remained huge). Even while other missiles were developed further to make them smaller and more lethal, no such progress seemed to have occurred with regard to the Pheonix.<br><br>Large size meant lack of manoeuvrability. Hitting larger bombers with these was ok, but hitting small, fast and agile modern fighters is another matter altogether.<br><br>I tried searching the internet for confirmed use of the missile in combat. Apparently, there seem to have only been a few during the first Gulf War, all missed.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>yeah, cessnas can do them. so can pipers etc. it is however their max rate turn. stalling speed increases 41% at 60deg aob. anymore than 60 and the stall buffet is felt. the lift needed at 60aob is roughly twice that of straight and level flight. trust me, i'm very sure they can do it, cos i myself have done 60aob turns.</div>

It was huge in size (and has remained huge). Even while other missiles were developed further to make them smaller and more lethal, no such progress seemed to have occurred with regard to the Pheonix.<br><br>Large size meant lack of manoeuvrability.

Perhaps its high speed reduces manoverability, with cruising speed of M3.8. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_eek.gif" alt="Shocked" title="Shocked"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Some Info on F14A operated in Iran<br><br><strong>Having received permission from the US government, Iran decided to purchase the F-14 Tomcat over a competing F-15 Eagle offer. An intial order for 30 F-14s was signed in January 1974, and this number was later increased to 80. The first of these aircraft arrived in Iran in January 1976, differing only from their American counterparts in the removal of certain classified avionics systems. These aircraft were also fitted with the improved TF30-414 engine, standard on later production models. Twelve aircraft were delivered by May 1977, and one of these was used to shoot down a BQM-34E target drone flying at 50,000 feet with an AIM-54 Phoenix missile in August of that year. This successful demonstration quickly convinced the Soviets to end the MiG-25 overflights. Deliveries continued until 1978 when the 79th unit was delivered, one example remaining in the US as a testbed (this plane was later transferred to US Navy flight test duties at the Point Mugu Naval Air Station following the Revolution). Some 714 Phoenix missiles were also ordered, but only 284 of these were delivered by the time of the Iranian Revolution in 1979. </strong><br><br><a href="http://www.aerospaceweb.org/question/planes/q0077.shtml" rel="nofollow">http://www.aerospaceweb.org/question/planes/q0077.shtml</a><br><br></div>
