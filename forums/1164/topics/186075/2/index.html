Neither do we really need it I guess.  In fact, I highly doubt this is an effective way to sink a ship.<br><br>1.  Without raising the radar antennae to sweep and confirm the target's location, the risk of collateral damage is very high, as the harpoon can accidentally target the wrong ship.<br><br>2.  Most warships have CIWS as well as SAMs to shoot missiles down, but not all have towed decoys against torpedoes.<br><br>3.  Launching harpoons from torpedoes requires subs to operate at a relatively shallow depth and a speed no greater than 4knots.<br><br>4.  To sink ships, u dun punch holes that let air in.

Besides, the target information needs to be entered by the launching submarines (unless there is now a data-link available for the harpoon to recieve course updates mid-flight).  Otherwise, the contact bearing is all that there is.  Or, the submarine has to do a risky radar sweep, which is almost certain to give away its exact location.<br><br>As for the sea skimming, well, I think that also requires precise target information.  Meaning exact distance of target.  Then can ALSO insert a series of waypoints and a final point to begin the popup manuever.  If the harpoon is just shooting down a contact bearing only, pk would be much lower.<br><br>Hence the solution to this is, don't use the harpoon.  Use torpedoes. They maybe slower, but if u run the torps a lil slower, say 30kts, they target's sonar won't detect the torpedo until its too late. Then kick it into full power and go active.  To make sure the target dies, have the torps come in from 3 different directions.  Unlike the harpoon, u can still communicate with the torpedo until u cut the wires.<br><br>Harpoons may not be able to rip thru a target if its a frigate and above.  Its excellent for smaller boats/frigates, where they lack sophisticated anti-air systems and are small enuff to be killed by 1 harpoon.  Anything bigger, torps are the way to go.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Well, by right, it shudden miss if launched with R2min and R2max.  But, sometimes quick snapshots won't be so ideal, hence the 2nd attack opportunity allows the missile to circle round and try for a 2nd hit.<br><br>If I am not wrong, the Python5 is currently capable of that.</div>
