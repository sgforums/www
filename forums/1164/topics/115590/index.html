            <div class='col-md body'>In theory the so-called rubber bullets should actually have the same power as that of a 5.56 live-ammo without the killing effect.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br>But in reality, the rubber bullet is heavier &amp; is useless at a distance of more then 50 to 100 m, which is good. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_eek.gif" alt="Shocked" title="Shocked"><br>So firing the rubber bullets at a distance of 15 to 50 m will most likely result in the target getting killed if it gets hit in vital areas.  But if its fired at a distance from 50 &amp; above, the outcome should be pain &amp; bruises only.   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br>However, like all weapons, one can never really consider a weapon to be non-lethal.  Take the taser gun thats being used by police in the U.S, its also suppose to ensure that the receiver of the shocks would suffer only extreme pain &amp; cramps but reports of deaths caused by the shocks are increasing.   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_twisted.gif" alt="Twisted Evil" title="Twisted Evil"><br>Why does it happens?  Well, no one can look at another human being &amp; said that he is fit for a jolt of electric current.  The receiver may look fit but may have unknown heart problems waitting to happen.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_neutral.gif" alt="Neutral" title="Neutral"><br>So don't believe anyones claim of having a non-lethal weapon or ammo, as long as its a weapon, it kills.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>the batons works near cos they need to be bounced off the ground to have the 'scatter' effect. another type of ammo is fro mshotgun, shoots a beanbag type projectile dats has a trailing end...but dun underestimate it....quite powderful also.<br><br>regarding taser, now is obselete...SPF now using plasma flachettes, stuns the aggressor enough so they can t-baton him down and cuff him away....oh...i think i played too much AVP : PH  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"></div>
