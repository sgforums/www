            <div class='col-md body'>ok another story.<br><br>Just prior to ROD we were again 'enemy' for another exercise. During that year we were best company in 4SIR so we alus kanna arrow for every fuch thing. At brigade level we were the most lao chiao unit for 3SIB followed by 3SIR(which  in those days was next to 4SIR camp).<br><br>The exercise was a conditioning for 3SIR as they would depart for brunei for their BTECH. 3 SIR was about 1.5 years old was second most lao chiao unit.<br><br>For this exercise the 'enemy' contigent would be 2 SIR which had just turned operational. Attached to 2 SIR was "BRAVO" coy from 4SIR(which was us).<br><br>Anyway the exercise was as follows.<br><br>Con area in tekong for 4 days. Scout elements from 3SIR would recce suspect enemy areas for 2 days marking all the areas, then main body from 3SIR would do a night 'forced march' on evening of third day to enemy base. On 4th day, do a dawn attack to clear enemy concentration areas then exercise cut. As an added measure, the newly posted brigade commander would follow 3SIR because 4SIR previous BTECH got recon3<br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_redface.gif" alt="Embarassed" title="Embarassed"><br><br>So for this exercise 3SIR cannot be seen to cockup.<br><br>Anyway first 3 days in the con area nothing much it was to be our last exercise so everybody was pretty "mood" leow so field discipline be damn. Supposed to dig shell scrape just lay white tape. Most of the time like all respectable infantry men, we would climb coconut trees, look for rambutan or just play with fire. At night everyone build campfire so bright that could be seen from miles around.<br><br>But on the morning of 4th day kanna contacted so as usual put up a show. Started firing, I was with 2 other guys &amp; we decided since last exercise we would expend every damn thing. As usual the guys from 3SIR did the classic MTC drill but just as they were doing the final charge the guy next to me shouted "retreat" and started running backwards. I looked at the other guy bewildered then we too started retreating. Next thing you know the whole bladdy company started running away. Normally anybody from SIR unit knows there is no retreat in such exercise, the guys from 3SIR looked @ their OC, their OC looked at brigade commander and he just said 'exercise continue' So 3SIR lan lan.<br><br>Why we retreated? I guess we feeling "mood" and just wanted to tekan.<br><br>We retreated about 1 click away and waited. Again they came did the MTC drill and just abt to charge again but this time everybody retreated and laughing at the same time. This time we could hear curses at us from behind.<br><br>Brigade commander says exercise continue but no more retreats.<br><br>So again we settled abt almost 1 click away again. This time MTC+charge, you could see their charge was more of a walk then run, but finally all the 'enemy' cleared.<br><br>Later as we were walking along the road back to the tonners the guys from 3SIR jeered at us calling us 'recruits' &amp; taunted us saying things like "ROD loh, 6 more months ROD loh"<br><br>They thought we were really from 2SIR. The whole company just laughed.<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz"></div>

Started firing, I was with 2 other guys &amp; we decided since last exercise we would expend every damn thing. As usual the guys from 3SIR did the classic <span style="color: red;">MTC</span> drill but just as they were doing the final charge the guy next to me shouted "retreat" and started running backwards. I looked at the other guy bewildered then we too started retreating. Next thing you know the whole bladdy company started running away. Normally anybody from SIR unit knows there is no retreat in such exercise, the guys from 3SIR looked @ their OC, their OC looked at brigade commander and he just said 'exercise continue' So 3SIR lan lan.<br></div></blockquote>MTC is tat an old term for some manouvres?????<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"><br></div>

Did I leak any secrets? You think anybody interested in singapore military do not know what goes on? You think the malaysians don't know we train in Brunei? They could easily pick up the second edition book "Defending The Lion City" on sale at all bookstores to know more than what I just described.<br><br>Besides these things happened donkey years ago. I think you just being paranoid.<br><br>BTW a few years ago during a bilateral exercise in west malaysia while training with the Royal Malaysian Guardsman one of them told us that besides knowing we train in Brunei they too frequently train overseas in terrains such as Brunei, Sarawak as well as AFGANISTAN AND IRAN!!! This info is about 12 years old.<br><br>You didn't know that did you? I think mebbe some kind of SAF clerk who dreams of doing field training but never gets any chance, or you still sucking your mama's titty waiting to go for national service.</div>
