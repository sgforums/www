            <div class='col-md body'><strong>North Korea launches volley of missiles on US holiday</strong><br><br>05 July 2006 0806 hrs (SST) 0006 hrs (GMT)<br><br>TOKYO : North Korea test-fired six missiles on Wednesday, including a long-range Taepodong-2 capable of reaching US soil, sparking furious condemnation from neighboring Japan and the United States.<br><br>US officials in Washington said Pyongyang launched five short- or medium-range missiles, which splashed down in the Sea of Japan, and a Taepodong-2 that apparently failed less than a minute after liftoff.<br><br>The South Korean news agency Yonhap reported 10 launches, but there was no official confirmation.<br><br>Urgent consultations were underway at the United Nations in New York following the tests, which coincided with the US Independence Day holiday and a US space shuttle launch. Washington announced it was dispatching a senior official to the region.<br><br>South Korea called an emergency cabinet meeting following the tests by its communist neighbor while Japan denounced the launches as a "grave problem" and said it was considering economic sanctions against North Korea.<br><br>The White House condemned the tests as "provocative behaviour" and a violation of a seven-year-old missile launch moratorium but said they did not pose an immediate threat to the United States.<br><br>In Tokyo, Japanese Chief Cabinet Secretary Shinzo Abe told reporters the missiles landed in the Sea of Japan, several hundred kilometers (miles) from the coast of Japan.<br><br>Abe, the government's top spokesman, said Pyongyang had defied the international community. "Today's launches were done despite advance warning by the relevant countries," he said.<br><br>"This is a grave problem in terms of peace and stability not only of Japan but also of international society. We strongly protest against North Korea."<br><br>"Japan will take stern measures against North Korea," he added.<br><br>"Cooperating with the United States, we will work for the UN Security Council to take appropriate measures.<br><br>"Japan will take any kind of sanctions we can take."<br><br>In Washington, the White House denounced the launches as "provocative" and the Taepodong-2 firing as a violation of a unilateral North Korean pledge made in 1999 to forego long-range tests.<br><br>"We do consider it provocative behavior," US national security advisor Stephen Hadley told reporters.<br><br>Hadley said the Taepodong-2 did not pose a danger to the United States because "a missile that fails after 40 seconds is not a threat."<br><br>The US missile defense system based in California, Alaska and onboard US Navy ships had been on high alert in anticipation of the Taepodong-2 test and ready to shoot any missile down if it threatened US territory.<br><br>But since it failed at an early stage, "no action was taken," said a US defense official.<br><br>A senior US official said the United States was sending its envoy to the six-nation North Korean nuclear talks, Assistant Secretary of State Christopher Hill, to Asia on Wednesday to discuss the situation.<br><br>At the United Nations, US Ambassador John Bolton held urgent talks with his foreign counterparts, but no formal meeting of the UN Security Council was immediately scheduled.<br><br>Japan is particularly sensitive to missile tests by North Korea, which in 1998 fired a Taepodong-1 missile over Japan into the Pacific, prompting Tokyo and Washington to step up cooperation to build missile defenses.<br><br>The North Korean missile launches came as millions of Americans celebrated Independence Day and minutes after the US space shuttle Discovery roared into space from Cape Canaveral, Florida.<br><br>US President George W. Bush was at the White House celebrating his 60th birthday two days early with a group of friends after making a stay-the-course speech on Iraq earlier in the day at a military base in North Carolina.<br><br>Bush stayed out of sight but discussed the volatile situation with Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice, Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld, and Hadley, the White House said.<br><br>US envoy Hill warned last week that a long-range missile launch by North Korea could derail the six-party talks over Pyongyang's nuclear program.<br><br>He said that a missile test would have "the opposite effect" and actually compromise rather than strengthen the regime's security.<br><br>Preparations for the launch of a multi-stage Taepodong-2 with a range of up to 6,700 kilometers (4,200 miles) had been underway for several weeks at Musudanri on the remote northeast coast of North Korea. - AFP /dt<br><br><a href="http://www.channelnewsasia.com/palmnews/asiapacific/view/217257/1/.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.channelnewsasia.com/palmnews/asiapacific/view/217257/1/.html</a></div>
