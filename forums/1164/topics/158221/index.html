            <div class='col-md body'>The following is an article from the dailypress.com<br><br>Mentioned smth abt US F-15s involved in exercise against Su-27s in Malaysia.<br><br><blockquote>Pilots say Raptor provides advantage<br>Fliers get to test the new Air Force fighter's mettle in two weeks of exercises that begin today.<br>BY JIM HODGES<br>l 247-4633<br>October 17, 2005<br>LAYTON, UTAH -- Bill Creeden remembers his first flight in an F-15 Eagle.<br><br>"The plane was older than I was," said Creeden, now a 27-year-old Air Force captain from Manassas. "But I thought, 'Hey this is training, so I shouldn't be surprised.' "<br><br>Then he got to Langley Air Force Base.<br><br>"When I got here, the plane was older than I was, too," Creeden said.<br><br>No more. He's flying the F/A-22 Raptor in two weeks of exercises that begin today at Hill Air Force Base. To him, it's like driving an expensive car he just bought.<br><br>"It looks, smells, feels new," said Creeden, who picked up 4.7 hours - pilots count their experience in six-minute increments - in the Raptor on Saturday, flying it from Langley to Hill.<br><br>That's one reason he's excited about flying the Air Force's new fighter.<br><br>Maj. Chuck Corcoran has another, gleaned from sitting in the back seat of a Russian Su-27 on an exchange visit.<br><br>"It was eye-opening," he said. "What was really eye-opening was how they go about training their pilots. They're getting more and more experienced."<br><br>That means they're getting better, and Corcoran isn't into jousting. With foreign technology catching up to the Air Force's staple, the F-15, he doesn't want to go against a well-trained pilot in equal equipment.<br><br>"If I can blow up a threat before he knows I'm there, that's what I want," said Corcoran, who is plainly enamored with the Raptor's stealth capability, both against other planes and surface-to-air missiles that are getting increasingly sophisticated.<br><br>"This plane can go places that an aluminum plane just can't. With the F-15, we'll probably both get a shot."<br><br>The last thing a pilot wants is to be a flying target in a gun - or missile - fight.<br><br>It's why Corcoran is in love with the Raptor.<br><br>Jim Hecker's reason is mathematical and goes to an exercise two years ago in which F-15 pilots fought Russian MiG-29s flown by Indian pilots.<br><br>"We were trading plane-for-plane," said Hecker, a lieutenant colonel who commands Langley's 27th Fighter Squadron, the first unit to fly the Raptor.<br><br>He admitted that it scared him, because the last thing a pilot wants is competition in the sky.<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Later, he flew F-15s against Su-27s in an exercise in Malaysia.</span> The American planes made out better that time, but not better enough.<br><br>"We want to win every fight 59-0," Hecker said.<br><br>He figures he can pitch a shutout every time with a Raptor.<br><br>Ask any of them about federal budget cutbacks that reduce the number of F/A-22s the Air Force can buy to 179 and you get the same answer. They admit that it's the company line.<br><br>"The Air Force says it needs 381 to perform its mission," Corcoran said. "I've heard it over and over again."<br><br>Even though it's getting harder to find the parts necessary to keep the F-15s in the air, their use probably will be extended as long as possible because fewer Raptors are being bought.<br><br>Fewer F/A-22s mean "we'll just be busier," Hecker said. "There will be more for us to do."<br><br>So how many are enough, without the company line?<br><br>"You'll know 40 years from now," said Capt. Shawn, a Raptor instructor who is in town to see if there's anything else he should be teaching the pilots.<br><br>He laughed and added, "Everybody will be sitting around the table and asking each other, 'Did we have enough Raptors?' " </blockquote></div>

The first phase will focus on system engineering to fully integrate the MSWS with the aircraft. The second phase of about 18 months will see a prototype developed and the production systems manufactured.<br><br>The fully integrated MSWS comprises a radar-warning system able to handle multiple simultaneous pulse Doppler and continuous wave signals, a laser-warning system, a solar blind ultra-violet missile approach warning system that can track more than eight targets simultaneously and an EW controller with an integrated defensive aids computer.<br><br>It gives audio warning of threats and shows detailed data on either a dedicated colour display or an existing colour multi-functional display. Active jamming and chaff/flare dispensers can be integrated with the system to suit the threat environment.<br><br>The MSWS is modular to facilitate tailoring to specific requirements and budget levels and can be specified to provide full spherical coverage.<br><br>The system is supplied with Pre-Flight Data Compiler and Flight Data Analyser software tools that enable the operator to tailor the system to suit the developing threat environment.<br><br>A memory-loading unit allows software to be loaded and unloaded on the flight line and various pre-flight data sets can be loaded and selected in flight as a mission proceeds. All relevant data is recorded during the mission for later downloading and analysis</div>
