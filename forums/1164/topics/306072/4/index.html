              <p>I'm not introducing new factors to the equation or trying to win an argument with you. I was merely stating my opinions which everyone is entitled to. You should not be relating my opinion on the growing sophistication of anti tank weaponry to my previous posts. They were never meant to be related in any way.</p>
              <p>There is no connection between point 1 and point 2. If the M1 numbers were still to small there would not be any logistic nightmare. So why did you try to connect these two. I didn't. I was merely stating that the T-72 and T-55 came out first than the M1.</p>
              <p>My question whether that the M1 would win the war is like saying that the F-22 would rule the sky i.e being vastly superior to any other contender. If the Ak-47 was vastly superior than the M-16 you could say that the AK-47 won the Vietnam war.  Don't take it literally. I thought it was obvious sigh.</p>
              <p>    Oh please dont think the T-72 and T-55 as such a bad tank incapable of killing NATO tanks. The ammunition that the Iraqis used during both gulf war was obsolete and many were supplied with training rounds or were selfproduced with abysmal quality material. A T-72 with later ammunition is capable of killing even an M1A1(HA) at over 1000m. Of course it may take load of hits to kill an M1A1(HA) with hits on its frontal turret armor(so you may say they are invulnerable at their frontal turret) but a hit on the lower hull and sides and the gap between the gun amntlet and the hull would surely kill the M1 first chance. Of course you cannot compare the T-55 or even T-72 with M1 on one to one basis. The T-55 and T-72 were more suited to fight with older NATO tanks such as the AMX-30, Leopard 1, Centurion, M-47 and M-48. But a T-72 is still capable of killing an M1 at more than 1000m given an updated ammunition and the right spot to hit.                                           I was just saying not to underestimate the T-55 and T-72 or Russian armor in general. They were good tanks in their time. The Russian always had a history in building capable tank starting with their T-34 with its innovative sloped armor that gave the German a pang or two on the face since they believed that the Russians were of inferior race. The T-55 was innovative too in a way. It introduced even more superior than simple(yet effective) sloped armor: hemispherical armor. I think the US copied the design to their own tank. That reflected the US high regard and acknowledegement to the superior shape of the Russian T-54/55. The Soviet also put the first tank with autoloader into production way before Challenger 2 or the Leclerc(I know about MBT 70 but that was never put into production). The Soviet was also the first to mount the superior(speed) smoothbore cannon in a tank starting with their T-62. Now almost all modern tank mount a smoothbore gun except the British Challenger and the Indian Arjun which continue the use of HESH round. The Soviet was also the first to mount night fighting(active Infra red) devices to their tanks.</p>
              <p>And I never mentioned or even implied that the Soviets (or the NATO for that matter), would be successful in invading Europe.</p>
              <p>I never even implied that the Soviet had smart weapons.</p>
              <p>Actually the Soviet also had smart anti tank weapons that are now offered for foreign sales. It is an artillery launched laser guided anti tank munition similar to what the US had(no longer in production). But now the US is developing a smart fire and forget type which is more advance as it doesn't need a forward observer.</p>

              <p>I'm not saying that you are not allowed to express your opinion.  But I was challenging your statement:-</p>
              <blockquote>
              <p>When the cold war was at its height do you think there were enough M1 tanks to stop the Soviet army tank of T-55s and the T-72s which sported the biggest smoothbore gun ever mounted in any tank?</p>
              </blockquote>
              <p>If you cannot see the connection between points 1 and 2, then I think this is a futile discussion on your part.  Munitions, Fuel, Food, and Water don't get "miracled" (pardon the pun) to the front line troops.  The more M1 tanks I have, the more supplies I need to move to get them to the troops.  The more supplies I need to move, the more vehicles I need to carry them.  The more vehicles I need to carry them, the more fuel I burn.  </p>
              <p>So the "fewer" M1s would have a much smaller logistics trail compared to the Soviet horde. The Americans are not stupid.  With far fewer tanks, they know they have to ensure a qualitative advantage of the Soviets. </p>
              <blockquote>

              </blockquote>
              <p>From this, its apparent to me that you do not understand the nature of armored warfare during the cold war.  An M1 is not gonna stay there, to take hit after hit from a T-72 or trade fire from a static position. Real armored warfare isn't Command &amp; Conquer.  Tanks move from position to position rapidly using smoke screens and indirect fire support.  The T-72 would have been eaten alive in an engagement against M1s. </p>
              <p>For the record, the T-72s that formed the BULK of the Soviet armies had inferior fire control computers, slow auto-reloaders, and inadequate survivability because the ammo carousel is located right under the turret.  The T-72s would have been hard pressed to hit the M1s, not to mention kill it.  Under 1000m, the T-72s would have a better chance hitting them, but killing them would still be questionable.</p>
              <p>The only tank the Soviets had that stood a chance against the M1s or M-60A2/A3s were the T-64.  These were at one point, exclusively used by Elite formations.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>If you still don't understand, I will spell it out.  My disagreement with you is over these 2 paragraphs, and the following baloney about T-55s and T-72s being very capable tanks.</p>
              <blockquote>
              <p>When the cold war was at its height do you think there were enough M1 tanks to stop the Soviet army tank of T-55s and the T-72s which sported the biggest smoothbore gun ever mounted in any tank?</p>
              </blockquote>
              <p>and</p>
              <blockquote>
              <p>Had there been World War III, do you think the M1 would win the war? The deployment of M1 requires extensive logistics chain thanks to its very very fuel thirsty turbine engine. M1s may be able to win a limited war but a protracted world war? maybe not. The Leopard 2 has a better chance I say.</p>
              </blockquote>
              <p> </p>
              <p>And that is the context of what I am challenging, the <strong>Cold War</strong>.  It has nothing to do with later developments of ammunition of T-72s or Smart Munitions.  Majority of the vast improvements came AFTER the Cold War where much Western technologies were used to improve them.   The T-72s, when compared against the corresponding M1 of its time, will always be just be equally inferior.</p>

              </div>
              <p>I think the yanks were not stupid when they introduced the M1, the issues of fuel efficency were considered and managed for the simple reason that high performance and battlefield reliability (turbines have less moving parts, more reliable and are easier to maintain) were more pressing needs for a western tank then having enough fuel.</p>
              <p>And in terms of performance the M1 offered a massive leap over the previous M60 Patton, and in the light of the cold war situtation it was a justified technological investment.</p>
              <p>Also the whole fuel efficency thing is often taken way out of context- yes the turbine of the M1 burns more fuel when it is in idle, but if you are talking about manuver warfare the turbine actually becomes the engine of choice because it actually burns less fuel then a normal powerpack at full trottle.</p>

              <p>I think the yanks were not stupid when they introduced the M1, the issues of fuel efficency were considered and managed for the simple reason that high performance and battlefield reliability (turbines have less moving parts, more reliable and are easier to maintain) were more pressing needs for a western tank then having enough fuel.</p>
              <p>And in terms of performance the M1 offered a massive leap over the previous M60 Patton, and in the light of the cold war situtation it was a justified technological investment.</p>
              <p>Also the whole fuel efficency thing is often taken way out of context- yes the turbine of the M1 burns more fuel when it is in idle, but if you are talking about manuver warfare the turbine actually becomes the engine of choice because it actually burns less fuel then a normal powerpack at full trottle.</p>
              <p>Also note this, if turbines were so impossible for armies to keep supplied and running, then it would be difficult to even operate helicopters.</p>
              <p>The whole thing on fuel efficency also raises more issues... even if a T-72 is two times more fuel efficent then an M1, in an expected battle can one M1 be expected to kill two T-72s or even more?</p>

              <p>T-rex argument need some correction</p>
              <p>The M1 turbine are smaller and more compact which the US select for M1. Althought it is more advance then M60 engine, but it is not fair to compare it with old generation engine, it should be compare with new desel engines like lepoard 2 which is in no way less powerful.</p>
              <p>T-Rex - fuel efficency thing is correct, yes the turbine of the M1 burns more fuel at the same rate regardless of idle or manuver, while the diesel engine, burn less fuel idle and a lot more in manuver. However issue in armour warfare - you do not power up only when you see the enemy,  - a huge percentage of time - the armour is actually idle then manuvering. That why M1 is a too fuel hunger, only super power like US that have the resource to push that type of supply line through can use M1.</p>
              <p>If turbines were so impossible for armies to keep supplied and running, then it would be difficult to even operate helicopters ? That is a wrong comments -Helicopter mostly operate out of airbase, they usually return to the airbase to be serivce and station there. So far i do not see tanks that fight then return to an tank-base behind the enemy line to serive and station there till deploy. Thus this is a wrong statment.<br><br>You totally miss out the greatest advantage of the turbine engine !  even thought it may be harder to maintance and eat more fuel ...... what it offer is in return is stealth -  quietest of its turbine engine ! - A M1 tank company can be so quiet - that by the time you hear their M1 tanks , they are already engaging the enemy.</p>

              <p>The Yanks went with a turbine engine in the M1 desprite all those disadvantage, because - you all totally miss the key advantage. Stealth  - the quietness of the turbine engine.  They are so quiet that by the time you hear them, they are already attacking you. <br><br>M1 fuel requirement is its main weakness - frankly unless you are a superpower like USA that can push the supplies through - it will be a great weakness for most countries ..... a tank without fuel is useless !!!</p>

              <p>Nope, they both may be 1,500hp packs but they are NOT equal.</p>
              <p>It's not just about power. Turbines are smaller and lighter and contain less moving parts then a conventional tank powerpack of the same power. Given their genesis in aviation requirements, the turbine is built for reliabilty at high power settings.</p>
              <p>In fact turbines offer advantages in just about every area over conventional powepacks except in one critical area, and that is fuel efficency.

              <p>In terms of stealth the turbine isn't that much quieter then the normal engine, however it does not sound anything like a tank would, more like a giant vaccum cleaner, which would confuse or catch an unexperienced enemy unaware. Also the M1 has a much larger IR signature then your normal MBT (basically it's a jet engine in a tank), making it show up better on thermal sights and what have you not. I'm not sure it's that stealthy.</p>
              <p>Frankly AFVs don't make that much noise as we'd expect them to, I've seen a BX approach me before and I could not hear it until it was pretty close.  </p>

Fuel consumption while idling is the turbine's weakest point, consumption at idle being perhaps three times as much as the diesel. On the other hand, the German engine weighs more than twice as much as the AGT-1500 turbine and occupies more volume.</p>

              <p>But that said, given the way things are now, with the end of the threat of having to face swarms of armour and the focus on urban fighting and network warfare, the yanks will probably go back to using a conventional powerpack for their next generation MBT.</p>

              <p>But that said, given the way things are now, with the end of the threat of having to face swarms of armour and the focus on urban fighting and network warfare, the yanks will probably go back to using a conventional powerpack for their next generation MBT.</p>

              <p>So?</p>
              <p>If you logistics trail can support it in case of the yanks, it's not an issue. Having enough too much armour and lack of fuel was never less of the issue of NATO forces, and having tanks that will outperform soviet tanks were.</p>
              <p>It's like saying our M-16 will waste far more bullets then the M-14 because of its higher rate of fire. At the end of the day can the M-1 still fight? Did it still fight? Of course it did. The rest is just nitpicking.</p>

              <p>Note this is speed for maximum range, not speed. For example, if both tanks were supposed to make best speed over time, advancing on to objective as quickly as possible, the turbine is the most efficent powerplant to use. At full power the diesel burnsa more fuel, as well as wears out faster.</p>
              <p>Also, turbines do not experience the cold-start problems that affect diesels and are capable of burning just about any kind of fuel you can put into it from jet fuel to jim bean (though for logistical purposes the Yanks use helicopter fuel for their tanks). Indeed save for fuel efficency the turbine outperforms the diesel in virtually every other area.</p>
              <p>The reason was for traffic safety during peacetime, but in wartime the speed governer is one of the first things the crew will remove. Before the governer was introduced there was an incident in which an M1 (the original model) outran an army jeep of MPs.</p>
              <p>When it was first introduced in the cold war, the turbine engine was considered the next step in MBT powerpacks, given their very good power-to-weight ratio and reliability. Even the soviets considered mounting them on the T-80.</p>
              <p>However, with the end of the threat of the cold war, the task of the MBT switched from having to go mano-a-mano in cold-war style armoured conflict into the more infantry-support and urban role that we have today. In this case fuel efficency will be more of an issue as the tanks will not be moving at top speed most of the time, this has led to the resurgence of the diesel powerplant as the choice engine for the MBT.</p>
              <p>An alternative idea has a MBT with a diesel powerplant for normal movement, and a gas turbine for bursts of speed when needed. The S-Tank used this configuration.</p>

              <p><br>No argument there, you basically restated all my points.</p>
              <p>In any case the M1A2 SEP improves on fuel efficency by havingan APU, hence not needing to idle the main engine whenever it is not moving, vastly improving it's fuel efficency over previous models.</p>
              <p>But in terms of armoured warfare, mobility will always be important. This not to much to dodge shots as it is to allow your forces to out-manuver the enemy, especially if you are talking about network-centric warfare which will involve a lot of battles of manuver.</p>

              <p>Diesels have gone along way the past 20 years.  They are very much more compact for the same power, are extremely reliable and very fuel efficient.  I do not see turbines having a future in MBTs -  neither do many other countries - US excepting of course.</p>
              <p>Personally, I'd rather not like to depend on a big a logistics tail , especially for fuel.</p>

              <p>A lot of  other countries seemed to have also bought a so called "crapload of L2s."  Fact is that L2s are great tanks.  </p>
              <p>History has repeatedly shown that lesser armored - read small- tanks are totally ineffective when the shooting starts in a full fledged war.  They invariably get  quickly replaced by more heavilly armored tanks.</p>
              <p>Matadors cant kill MBTs. You will need more SPIKEs or Javelins or the new Russian ATGMs which are highly effective. Russian ATGMs  can even pentrate Merkava armor.</p>
