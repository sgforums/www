            <div class='col-md body'>I think we dun really need to worry abt those Russian destroyers. If u look deeper into their capabilities rather than their names, u will discover usually Russian vessels of same class compared to NATO ships. They have lesser stealth features and they also seems to be a little underarmed. They only have 8 sunburn missiles and other features that is slightly similar or perhaps weaker than our Formidables.<br>I think RSN should concentrate on solving the issue of ferry the Leo2, get a larger transport ship. Another interesting thing maybe we can stretch the Formidables a bit longer to mkae way for some land attack cruise missiles, need not have too many, but say another 2x8 slots of VLS, it will add more dimensions to our offensive capabilties.</div>
