            <div class='col-md body'>Actually, the distinction between frigates and destroyers is very blurred nowadays as both type of vessels have overlapping roles(AAW, ASW), the only difference being in displacement(actually some larger frigates have about the same displacement as a normal destroyer).Put it this way,our formidable class frigates can actually be considered as a"mini destroyer" itself.Therefore i don't see having destroyer as very feasible, both in terms of manpower and operational costs.<br><br>Just my two cents</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I think this debate came up before and one of the key points against having a destroyer would be that the RSN simply doesnt have the manpower to run a destroyer. Wiki says our Formidables requires 85 crewmen including  the cew of the Seahawk. From what limited knowledge I have, destroyers need 200-300(correct this if I'm wrong). About 3 frigates crew for one destroyer. Given that NS has been shortened, can our peeps really handle a destroyer?</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Actually our Formidables are actually mini destroyers. They are multi-purpose platforms that can be used for AA , ASW and ASuW. The only difference is that they are smaller and required less crew due to both ship size and high automation.<br><br>The waters which our navy operates in, is considered as littoral waters. Considering the massive amount of civilian shipping and the numerous islands in our area, having a smaller vessel is actually an advantage. Large vessels are relatively harder to steer as compared to smaller ones.<br><br>Further more the nearest ocean to Singapore is the Indian ocean which is already the playground of the Indian,Chinese,Pakistani and US navies. The situation is complicated enough i guess they don't really want another player there.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"></div>

Really hope they get some new ones instead of 2nd-hand Swedish. After all, some believe that the age of the aircraft carrier is giving way to the age of the submarine.</div>
