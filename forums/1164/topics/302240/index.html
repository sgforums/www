            <div class='col-md body'>Actually, the 1st bomb that was dropped on hiroshima wasn't even tested at all la. Cos they didn't have enough uranium to conduct a test, and the scientists were sure that the design would work.<br><br>They did do a test detonation of the 2nd plutonium bomb b4 using it though.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>If u visit Hiroshima peace centre, u can see the original letter by general mac authur orders for bombing japan which stated 5 atomic bomb scheduled for bombing of Japan. Lucky for the Japanese, their emperor surrendered after the second drop. Else i wont be sure if japan can ever recover if all 5 bombs were drop.</div>
