Kitty Hawk</span><br><br>American military chiefs have been left dumbstruck by an undetected Chinese submarine popping up at the heart of a recent Pacific exercise and close to the vast U.S.S. Kitty Hawk - a 1,000ft supercarrier with 4,500 personnel on board.<br><br>By the time it surfaced the 160ft Song Class diesel-electric attack submarine is understood to have sailed within viable range for launching torpedoes or missiles at the carrier.<br><br>According to senior Nato officials the incident caused consternation in the U.S. Navy.<br><br>The Americans had no idea China's fast-growing submarine fleet had reached such a level of sophistication, or that it posed such a threat.<br><br>One Nato figure said the effect was "as big a shock as the Russians launching Sputnik" - a reference to the Soviet Union's first orbiting satellite in 1957 which marked the start of the space age.<br><br>The incident, which took place in the ocean between southern Japan and Taiwan, is a major embarrassment for the Pentagon.<br><br>Scroll down for more ...<br><img src="http://img.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2007/11_01/2submarine_468x396.jpg"><br><br><span style="color: blue;">Battle stations: The Kitty Hawk carries 4,500 personnel </span><br><br><strong>The lone Chinese vessel slipped past at least a dozen other American warships which were supposed to protect the carrier from hostile aircraft or submarines. </strong><br><br>And the rest of the costly defensive screen, which usually includes at least two U.S. submarines, was also apparently unable to detect it.<br><br>According to the Nato source, the encounter has forced a serious re-think of American and Nato naval strategy as commanders reconsider the level of threat from potentially hostile Chinese submarines.<br><br>It also led to tense diplomatic exchanges, with shaken American diplomats demanding to know why the submarine was "shadowing" the U.S. fleet while Beijing pleaded ignorance and dismissed the affair as coincidence.<br><br>Analysts believe Beijing was sending a message to America and the West demonstrating its rapidly-growing military capability to threaten foreign powers which try to interfere in its "backyard".<br><br>The People's Liberation Army Navy's submarine fleet includes at least two nuclear-missile launching vessels.<br><br>Its 13 Song Class submarines are extremely quiet and difficult to detect when running on electric motors.<br><br>Commodore Stephen Saunders, editor of Jane's Fighting Ships, and a former Royal Navy anti-submarine specialist, said the U.S. had paid relatively little attention to this form of warfare since the end of the Cold War.<br><br>He said: "It was certainly a wake-up call for the Americans.<br><br>"It would tie in with what we see the Chinese trying to do, which appears to be to deter the Americans from interfering or operating in their backyard, particularly in relation to Taiwan."<br><br>In January China carried a successful missile test, shooting down a satellite in orbit for the first time.<br><br></div>

The wired thing is neither party involved in the report ever comes out and clarifies even a bit.  Meanwhile, after so many days, a lot of other media just quote and report the same thing:<br><br><a href="http://www.afriquenligne.fr/news/daily-news/chinese-sub-embarrasses-u.s.-navy-2007111111176/" rel="nofollow">http://www.afriquenligne.fr/news/daily-news/chinese-sub-embarrasses-u.s.-navy-2007111111176/</a><br><br><a href="http://www.clevelandleader.com/node/3540" rel="nofollow">http://www.clevelandleader.com/node/3540</a><br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Well according to this paper, laser for detection &amp; laser for communication actually are in the same principle.<br><br><a href="http://www.darpa.mil/sto/maritime/slc.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.darpa.mil/sto/maritime/slc.html</a><br><br><blockquote> <strong>Blue Laser for Submarine Laser Communications (SLC) and Non-Acoustic Anti-Submarine Warfare (ASW)</strong><br><br>Program Manager: Dr. Larry Stotts<br><br>The goal of the DARPA Blue Laser for Submarine Laser Communications (SLC) and Non-Acoustic Anti-Submarine Warfare (ASW) program is to develop a high wall-plug efficient, Blue Light (455nm), Solid-state Laser.<br><br>Foreign submarines are quieter than ever before, and there is a pressing need for improved ASW capabilities, particularly in shallow water (above the thermocline) and littoral areas of operations. Coordination between multiple assets such as aircraft, surface ships, and submarines is critical to an effective ASW campaign. Integration of submarines into an overall ASW effort, arguably the most effective platform for wide area search and tracking, has traditionally been hampered by lack of or minimal communications to the submarine while deep.<br><br>The Navy is currently investing in new and previously demonstrated techniques for communicating with submarines at speed and depth for coordinated ASW operations. These techniques most commonly use either trailing wires or towed buoys for submarine communications, which impose limitations on the submarine's maneuverability and stealth, and therefore negatively impact the submarine's ability to fully conduct ASW operations. An airborne laser which could penetrate shallow water would permit submarine communications without the restrictions of floating wires or buoys.<br><br>This program is intended to develop the world's first wall-plug efficient laser that operates both at an optimum water transmission band of open ocean water and at the wavelength of a Cesium Atomic Line Filter. <strong>This laser has the potential to improve the detection depth of a NAASW lidar system by a significant factor for the same reasons it could improve submarine communications.</strong></blockquote></div>
