Even the Indonesian press did not pick it up. If you are saying that a super-sonic cruise missile purchase is`nt big news here, then you`re holding on to thin air. Even reports on such `interestsÂ’ get carried in the press. This report remains speculative unless I see more credible sources such as Janes, etc. And that means you`re speculative.

Poor man`s option indeed. The Indonesians are struggling to bring their systems back online Â– the current ones online. Look at their army, air-force and navy. Let alone buy a whole bunch of cruise missiles.<br><br><blockquote>Wat i meant was when the Aussies said they r buying long range missiles see all the noise the others made.......Maybe Indo have learnt from that n also M r looking at BrahMos as well....So there's no noise from the usual sources</blockquote>Maybe this? maybe that? Pop goes the weasel. The Aussies did`nt blink an eye when they did that.  Tell me who`s going to make noise at Indonesia if she decides to buy the brahmos? A country of 210 million people? Who in the right mind would do anything to Indonesia? As far as arms procurement are concerned, they`re on top with the rest up there in terms of ignoring other countries' concerns.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I doubt Indonesia will be buying the Yakhont or Brahmos missile why? Bcos Indonesia war ship belong to the NATO/European philosophy desing ones. which means the missiles are mounted 2 stack on 2, positioned perpendicular to the length of the vessel. While this Russian missile being so enormous in size will be like Russian warship mounting them parallel to the length of the ship. Judging from how large the missile is, unless their navy accquire warships bigger than an average frigate, I doubt the Indons will consider the Russian missiles at all. Besides, they recently accquired 3 sigma class corvettes from the Dutch, and their inventories being mostly European based, I doubt they are going to buy a Russian system that can't fit in the original system. Their economy is also not doing well, thus they won't want to jeopardize the welfare of their ppls and at the same time, incite an arms race.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote>please chew forty times on my posts before you swallow. </blockquote>The unfortunate fact is that when it comes to your posts(be it here or elsewhere), I(if not all) simply could`nt just swallow; now or historically.<br><br><blockquote>i remarked that a better missiles (compared to MM40) should have similar support with regards to helicopter assist. it is entirely likely that TNI has no capable helicopters (with the necessary radars, optronics and avionics) to support yakhont now. but purchase of the yakhont (or brahmos) without such support is entirely meaningless. true or false? </blockquote>What true or false? If you have`nt got the implied and explicit meaning in my previous post, the logic is clear. Learn to read.<br><br><blockquote>similarly, if we look at malaysia's super lynx, these helicopters were inducted about three years after the first MM40 entered service (if i'm not mistaken). for those three years, the MM40 were not operating at their optimum capability. now they are. similar scenario could be applied to the yakhont's that're supposedly bought by TNI. </blockquote>- I have my doubts whether or not the RMN is operating her weapons at any optimal level; even at all. As for the Yakhont, you don`t know that so how can you conclusively say that it is so. You`ve just drawn a parallel without deferring to the specifications of the missile; my point being so.<br><br><blockquote>and i didn't say the super lynx's are equipped to handle brahmos. mind you, MM40's maximum range is, what? 120km? brahmos (or yakhont for that matter) is 300km. nobody in their right mind would equip the lynx with radars etc that can reach 300km whereas the best missiles they have can only reach 120km and of a different make than what the radars etc etc are supposed to handle. </blockquote>No you did`nt. Just to make a point about it. So, it is agreed, they can`t.<br><br><blockquote>on the other hand, if brahmos are to be inducted by malaysia's RMAF for the su-30s, the planes' radars and etc etc should be able to handle brahmos without any assistance from any helicopters.<br><br>and no, RMAF's su-30 cannot handle AMRAAM or sparrows. even you knows that.</blockquote>I have no doubt the Sukhois can take on the Brahmos. But I doubt they will; by Malaysia. Not unless Singapore deploys Slammers or such similar weapons.</div>

In fact, many more places are within reach of Singapore`s air-force, navy and surveillance.<br><br>You can`t place them at Batam in peace-times because we have so much leverage on the prosperity of that place; if not the whole Indonesian archipelago.
