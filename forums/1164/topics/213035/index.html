            <div class='col-md body'>Read carefully... the active radar only goes active 40km of WHERE IT THINKS ITS TARGET is.  Without mid course updates, the missile could hit ANYTHING that appears in its cone @ 40km.  That makes it vulnerable to decoys and all sorts of ECMs.<br><br>Also, to shoot from such long (touted 300km) distance, WHAT is going to do the initial targetting in the first place?<br><br>This missile is a threat... to merchant shipping that won't have any idea whats going to hit them.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Yakhont (missile Brahmos based on)<br><br><blockquote>Employs stealth technology, has supersonic flight speed and a completely independent guidance system based on the fire-and-forget concept. The missile is 8.9 meters (29.1 feet) in length. <strong>It can be launched from ships, aircraft, submarines, or even ground mobile launchers </strong>and is fired from a unified encapsulated ampoule - shaped transporter - launching container. Flight speed is at Mach 2.0+, using a kerosene liquid-fuel ramjet, with a terminal run at Mach 2.5.<br><br>Range is at 300 km in a hi-lo profile or at 120 km at altitudes of 5-15 metres, in a lo-lo profile. A regular mid-course phase of the flight occurs at 15 km. If and when launched from submarines, the vessel must be fitted with 650mm torpedo tubes. An operational missile designed for hitting complex sea-based and in-shore targets, a vessel armed with the Yakhount can carry out combat operations against warships or even against carrier battle groups.<br><strong>Yakhont's navigation system uses an inertial guidance system based on the present target location data. At a pre-calculated flight point (around 25 - 80 km), a brief turn-on of the homing scanner occurs, resulting in exact determination of target location. After that, the homing system turns on only when the Yakhont leaves the radio horizon and drops its altitude to 5 - 15 metres, i.e. a few seconds before hitting the target. </strong>It carries a 250 kg (553 lbs.) warhead.<br><br>The missile's designers assume, that the enemy would detect the launch of the missile at the distance of 300 km and take measures to destroy it. However, being resistant to jamming, having the flight velocity of 750 m/s and making complex maneuvers during flight, the Yakhont ASCM shall anyway reach the target. <strong>It is not the high speed or jamming protection that makes Yakhont an advanced weapon system. It's major advantage is the guidance system which has accumulated all experience everywhere in developing electronic systems of AI (Artificial Intelligence)</strong> enabling to fight against single warships (one missile - one ship) or even against a group of warships (a flock against a group).<br><br>It is salvo launching that shows all unsurpassed tactical capabilities of the Russian weapon. The missiles allocate and range targets by their importance and choose the attack implementation plan. <strong>The independent control system keeps in memory not only of the ECM (Electronic Countermeasures) and ECCM (Electronic Counter-Countermeasures) data, but also the methods of evading the fire of the enemy's air defense systems such as the US' Phalanx CIWS (Close-In Weapon System). </strong>Having destroyed the main target in a carrier group, the missiles left attack other ships of the carrier group, eliminating the possibility of using two missiles on one target.</blockquote></div>

It's said that Brahmos can perform both active n passive homing modes. Passive modes like anti-radiation or home-on-jam.<br><br><blockquote>The seeker uses a hybrid form of pulse compression, in which bursts of short pulses are phase-coded so that they can be compressed; the bursts can also be Furier-transformed to discriminate chaff clouds. This particular pulse compression technique was adopted to hold down peak power,so making ESM detection difficult. The missile can also scan a number of targets in the area to identify the one it is supposed to hit. This capability is normally obtained through screen matching criteria, but Brahmos employs special algorithm that classifies targets based on their radar cross section as contained in the pre launch data.</blockquote></div>
