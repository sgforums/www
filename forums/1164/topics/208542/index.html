One would gather they are very dedicated to the mission but seems to be disorganized.  To the point that a commander has to use a loud hailer.  I wonder where did that come from. Does this happen so often that he has to pack a loud hailer?<br><br>They have a medical doctor. Thats nice.<br><br>The injured soldier said the opfor was shooting at any sound of walkie talkie. So much so he put his ear piece in his mouth.<br><br>They were extremely complacent when they found the cache of ammunition.  Assumed to be a standard hidden cache to be used later.

            <div class='col-md body'>I think the confusion arised becasue the 2 Hizbellah chaps were also wearing IDF uniform. This causes great confusion among the ranks.....noticed 1 scene where 1 of the soldier was about to shoot in one direction before being stopped by the commander.<br><br>In order to differentiate themselve, the Rigimental Commander ordered all soldiers to take out their helmet cover to identify themselve....<br><br>FIBUA Night assault is fragging confusing......corridors are dark......dont know where is the next turn..........even if thunderflashs were throw at you, you also wont see it except for the clanking sound........... went through that in our ICT ATEC.....<br><br>Lucky no one was hurt with all the thunderflash thrown and automatic firings.........<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>My admiration to the IDF troopers who, under very difficult 'circumstances', went into S Lebanon to flush out a very elusive enemy.  But still, looking at the clips and the animation taught me something:<br><br>a)<strong> NVGs</strong> - I noticed that not all the IDF troopers are equiped with NVGs (cost aside, please) esp when the raid is conducted at night, they are like 'blind'.  No idea 'who-is-where' and 'what'?<br>=&gt; <span style="font-style: italic;">Instead of being independent fighting force, the 'inability' to see makes them huddle together (?)</span><br><br>b) <strong>Poor coordination(?)</strong> - The part where the trooper said "aren't the Golani Brigade supposed to be covering our left?"<br>=&gt; <span style="font-style: italic;">the confusion that they are 'exposed' and thus possibly have to worry that their left flank is exposed. </span><br><br>b) <strong>Discipline </strong>- During the firefight, people are shouting.<br><span style="font-style: italic;">=&gt; Understand it is 'pretty tough to keep cool' under fire, but it all adds to unnecessary confusion and may even effect fellow troopers' morale.</span><br><br>c) <strong>Poor judgement (poor intel?) or even naiveness (on troopers' part).  </strong>On the part that the troopers were confused over the identity (in IDF uniforms) 2 Hezbollah troopers in the room.<br><span style="font-style: italic;">=&gt; It is a known Hezbollah building, and if there is no pre-known info of IDF presence operating in the building, do the IDF expect to find IDF personnel in the room?<br>=&gt; Lesson: If no info of own friendly troops in the building, one has to take all 'other' personnel (even if wearing the uniform of own's uniform) as hostile.<br>=&gt; PLEASE don't intro the concept of friendly fire here.  READ: YOU'RE THE ONLY KNOWN FRIENDLY FORCE OPERATING IN THE BUILDING AND YOU ARE LEADING THE CHARGE, DO YOU EXPECT THE OTHER PERSON STANDING ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE ROOM TO BE YOUR OWN?</span><br><br>d) <strong>Clearing room</strong>.  Eveon when Hezbollah combatants fired through the door, the IDF troopers should have fired a heavier round into the room rather than lobbing grenades.<br>=&gt; Concept borrowed from Hezbollah.  Perhaps the IDF should have fired a LAW into the room.<br>=&gt; <span style="color: red;">New uses for SAF's LAWS?  Even though the MATADOR has replaced the LAW, seems like Hezbollah has 'taught' us that the LAW is pretty handy in urban warfare.</span><br><br>e) <strong>Calmness of the IDF MO.</strong>.  The MO's slow and calm voice is very comforting to the injured soldier and may even helped to calmed the situation.  At least the MOD didn't screamed orders like "Oh SHUT UP SOLDIER!  It's just a slight wound nothing serious!"<br><br>f) Lastly, the bright lights of the Israeli Border towns is a very simple message to the combating trooper (esp when this trooper is a reservist) on why they are engaging the battle into Labanon.

            <div class='col-md body'>I think in that particular situation, it would have been a careless decision to fire a LAW into that room.  Firstly, the 3 Israeli troops are in there as well, and they could be hit by the LAW as well.  Secondly, they rest of the troops really have no idea which part of the building the 3 guys are in.  I doubt the commander would dare to fire n risk hitting friendlies in side.<br><br>It seemed that the Hezbollah militants inside the ammunition room knew the Israeli troops were coming, and decided to ambush them from behind the door.  From the 3D animation, its likely that the militants were equipped with NVGs and were able to survey the 3 Israeli soldiers in the building.  When they passed the corridor in front of the room, they were caught in the kill zone at a very close range.  The hezbollah militants were able to shoot through the door and hit.<br><br>It seemed that there was absolute chaos in the front. They were given orders, that were rather vague.  There was no objective to be taken, just instructions to follow. It was amazing the commanders were still able to hold the picture together despite the entire engagement taking a sour turn at their first building. Clearly, that building was not an objective, just another building to be looked at.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><br>I actually think it is a great idea to pack a loud hailer for combat commanders.<br>So many times during mission that I wished I had one. I also wished we have whistles ('like the Viet Cons'). Yes, we have radio sets. But when you are out in combat fire and manoevre, I tell you, the last thing that happen is things go the way they are planned. It is always very chaotic. People all over the place, lost, missing, not in order. Even basic but effective means of communication will work wonders then nothing.<br><br>When things are so chaotic and people are spread out, shouting is norm. You shoot for the concern of your men, to keep them in formation, to keep them safe, to keep the unit safe. If you don't keep your unit in formation, you risked yourself or your men being killed. No prize for keeping quiet and all composed.<br><br>As a combat leader, I will also not order to shoot, even if I know the area is suspected to contain enemy. This is because in actual combined unit fire and manoevre, it is always very confusing. People get lost. You get lost. So there is a chance that friendlies will stray or you stray into other friendlies' areas. Combat intelligence is also cannot be fully relied on for your lives. We are talking about taking a fellow section/platoon/company's mates live we may take, if we just fire without clearer identification.</div>
