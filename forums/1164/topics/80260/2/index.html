I have already expressed my apologies in missing out some of the primary and secondary tasks of PF and directed any future queries to you. So what is that one bone you want to pick with me for?<br><br>With regards to not wanting others to know about the units in SAF, I have already stated that it is an alternative view. Did I mention in any part of my post that I want anyone to agree with me? Go figure out what is the meaning of "alternative".<br><br>I respect the PF vocation, but bear in mind that there are other units who worked behind enemy lines as well. These units are often without recognition, because recognition will compromise their task and lead to a FUCK-UP operation, they just want to do their jobs and live to see as many dawn/dusk as possible. Hence, first in, last out doesn't just apply to you, operator-wannabe!<br><br>And about the signature, if you can have your own signature, why can't I? It is my GODDAMN given right to do so.  And for your information, the signature was added prior to your posting of your topic. If you want to get uptight about this, then that's just too bad.</div>

Guess with your mentality, you probably didn't get the gist of the post. Not surprised that few liners from you is all you can manage.<br><br>Nobody is arguing about exposing the technical aspects of the PF nor its capabilty and training. All I have wrote was to graciously admit that I don't know much about PF and hence decide to leave it to qualified troopers to answer any questions regarding PF. Frankly, I don't see anything wrong with that. Unlike someone, who is so 'modest' pretending not wanting to disclose and yet want the recognition (if not why post this topic in the first place?)<br><br>I may not know much about PF, however with regards to carrying out 'behind enemy lines' types of missions/training/exercise and meeting objectives, I have my fair share of success. Therefore, I don't need to prove anything to anyone here. As for who's the empty vessel, I will leave it to the readers to judge.<br></div>
