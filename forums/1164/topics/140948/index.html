After all, London was announced as the winner just one day before the bombings. For the terrorists to plan, build and plant the bombs in a matter of hours is highly unlikely..... after all, meticulous planning is the hallmark of Al Qaeda. Even if they had a set of 'contingency bombing' plans for every major city in the world, it'll take at least days for the plan to be set into motion.<br><br>More likely they were planning to disrupt the G8 summit in Scotland. The IOC decision was just a coincidence. This makes Theory 2 far more likely. After all, the Brits have always been seen as the main 'partner-in-crime' with the Yanks.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Possibility:  All cities concerned in the IOC could have been rigged long ago.  They MAY be trying to blow whichever city that the IOC decides on.  And when such an incident occurs, they may decide to change the venue, and when they decide on another, the group blows it there too.<br><br>Sounds far fetched huh?<br><br>Its too coincidental for London to be hit just as the IOC announces their decision. It probably means all this was planned for maximum "exposure."  So there IS a possibility that all the countries involved in the IOC, had their respective cities targetted.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>ok, seriously, lets not put him down this way cause there IS a possibility the frenchys are behind this, althou i would say not a high chance cause the french don't really need the olympics that badly, i would say it is more like to target london, to disturb the G8 summit, the fact that it came after london's bid is a BIG BIG BIG bonus to the tangos</div>
