Armed with auto loaded 105 mm gun firing anti-tank rds (APFS/-DS), HE n smoke rds, empty cartridges cases being auto ejected from rear. It has three 7.62 mm MGs (two parallel with main gun n one on com's cupola). Normal range for 105mm gun is up to 2000 m n rate of fire is 10 rds/min.<br><br><img src="http://www.trackpads.net/tanks/sosfindlay/p/modoth/stan_6.jpg"><br><img src="http://www.trackpads.net/tanks/sosfindlay/p/modoth/stan_23.jpg"><br><br>Strv 103 weighs 39.7 tonnes n has crew of three: commander, driver(also operating as gunner) n radio operator(also function as driver when tank is going in reverse). Max road speed is 50 kph. On-road n off road ranges are 390 n 150 km respectively.<br><br>Strv 103 is equipped with a float-skirt n can be made ready for fording within 30 min. The driver stands on a special platform n steers with reins. After fording, vehicle can be made ready for action again within 10 min.<br><br>Strv 103s are fitted with a dozer blade n can be fitted with mineclearing rollers at front of the hull.<br><br><img src="http://www.trackpads.net/tanks/sosfindlay/p/modoth/stan_7.jpg"><br><br>Good defensive tank,it carries 50 rds main gun ammo n 3 MGs(enough for anti infantry role)<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>When it first appeared in the 60's it was a revolutionary design because of the low profile in the hull-down position. The British army was interested enough to lease a battalion of it for trials but most users soon found the idea impractical- you cannot fire on the move with any accuracy, and to shoot further, you have to apply pneumatic pressure on the suspension in order to raise or lower the front or back of the tank accordingly. Not a lot of flexibility.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Not really impractical back during WW2.  Those were really cheap platforms with enormous fire powers.  Rather than building huge and heavily armored tanks, and loading them with big high velocity guns.  They built lower profiled assault guns, that packed the same amount of firepower of a tank, better frontal armor (slope), and Cheaper.<br><br>U don't have to have a very heavy vehicle to have a big gun, and u don't have troublesome and expensive turret systems to build and maintain.<br><br>Camouflage down an potential avenue of advance in an urban area, and u'd give the enemy a hell of a time trying to kill it.</div>

Main gun traverse by pivoting vehicle on its tracks n elevation by adjusting hydropneumatic suspension.
