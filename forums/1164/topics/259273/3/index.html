            <div class='col-md body'>Ya i know you not saying for pure wheels.  I will be pissed if SAF does that though.  That one's asking for trouble.<br><br>It's perfectly alright to have wheeled AFV/LTs that's air transportable though.  Way more effective to deploy behind enemy lines, penetrate and disrupt them at form up points - hit and run, delay enemy from pushing forces forward then slowly fight a delay battle to link up with the normal advancing forces.<br><br>One more thing regarding as tactics, while effective, the force is kinda without support ie casualty rate is very high.  Same with block force that you deploy behind enemy forces to "hammer/anvil" them.<br><br>Yes we still need a LT even with BMS,arty,AH,blahblahblah.<br><br>I'm a little sad that the old one's been scrap.<br>A little stuff regarding LTs, it's basically a heavier AFV with a main gun.<br><br>Advantages - large calibre LOS / FS weapon.<br>Less maintainence/cheaper to build/maintain than MBT.<br>Mobile, probably RC capable, air transportable,can be wheeled.<br>Able to react quicker in ambush vs ATGM AFV ie can defend itself better.<br>Cheap rounds vs ATGM.<br><br>Disad - protection for crew is only as good as the AFV body.<br>Main gun limitations in terms of penetration due to lesser recoil requirement. Short Engagement range ~2km.<br>Ammo carried is less and most probably HE/HEAT/HESH/AP only.<br>Smaller body = auto loader = usually slower reload.<br>Unable to maintain covering fire the way a CG AFV is able to.<br>Fire on the move...?<br><br>Regarding my thoughts of Missile tanks - requirements will be LOAL and VLS - one is to improve crew survivalbiliity the other to save space and reduce combat disabling.</div>

Fighting concept have changed but our terrain hasn't change. </div></blockquote>Actually our terrain HAS changed... So has Malaysia's...and many other parts of the world.<br><br>There are now much, much more paved roads, scondary roads than there ever was 50 years ago.<br><br>Any army considering a rapid advance would be mad not to try to control and use the road networks. Armies had been using roads since WW1, WW2, Afghanistan, Korea etc. It is a  misconception that nobody use the roads during war.<br><br>As much as I am not in favour of wheels, this is the reality today. Wheels are faster on roads.<br><br>So I won't be surprised SAF will not get a tracked LT. I actually see very little urgent need for one. Our AMX-13S1 will serve on for another 5 to 10 years, I think. Though in steadily dwindling numbers.<br><br>As someone already said, SAF is likely to get wheels whether some of us like it or not.<br><br>IMO, SAF WILL DEFINITELY want to field properly-equipped RDF brigades soon. And RDF need wheels to be fast on roads and possible air deployment.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Agree, wheels move a lot faster on roads, and would provide better fuel economy when traversing through paved surfaces. A healthy number of those should be made available, and those with amphibious -swim capabilities.<br><br>Of course, the beauty of tracks would really show when the paved surfaces start disappearing from bombings, shelling, and other counter mobility operations.  So we cant live without tracked vehicles as well.<br><br>Anyone has a list of contenders for this series of wheeled fighting vehicles?  Besides terrex, I'd imagine the Stryker/LAV-25 series would be included, and perhaps BTR-90?  Centauro? Pirahna? Pandur2?</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Looks like what I predicted came true. I have speculated back then when we bought the Leopards, that we would buy wheeled AFVs to complement the Leopards, as 1) this is what global trends represent, and also 2) the combined tracked and wheeled package will completely replace the SM1 in quantity as well.</div>
