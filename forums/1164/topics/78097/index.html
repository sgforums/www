The bodies of four other hostages have since been found.<br><br>It was not clear how Mr Hamill ended up near Tikrit, which is about 150 km (90 miles) north of where the convoy attack occurred.<br><br>US military units were patrolling a petroleum pipeline when Mr Hamill approached and identified himself.<br><br>"Mr Hamill apparently escaped from a building," Mr Kimmitt said.<br><br>"He has spoken to his family. He is now ready to get back to work," he said.<br><br>In the US, Mr Hamill's wife, Kellie, said she received a call telling her that her husband had been found alive.<br><br>She said it was "the best wakeup call I've ever had," in remarks quoted by the Associated Press.<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Television footage </span><br><br>Mr Hamill was one of several foreign nationals abducted in early April as violence flared up in Iraq.<br><br>Mr Hamill, 43, went missing when the fuel convoy he was travelling in was ambushed by Abu Ghraib prison west of Baghdad.<br><br>Two US soldiers and six other employees of American oil firm Kellogg, Brown and Root (KBR) also went missing after the attack.<br><br>Following the ambush, Mr Hamill appeared in video footage aired on Arabic TV, in which his captors threatened to kill him if the US siege of Falluja was not lifted.<br><br>The bodies of four of the KBR employees were later found in a shallow grave near the site of the attack.<br><br>The body of the soldier, Sgt Elmer Krause, was also found and identified on 23 April . The fate of the remaining US soldier and the two contractors is unknown.<br><br>Mr Hamill's freedom came as US marines began withdrawing from Falluja, handing over to an Iraqi military force.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Note, the inverted commas in 'escapes' is from the BBC, not me!<br><br>Firstly, I would like to say I'm relieved that Thomas Hamill is safe, anyone who watched the newsclip shot when he was seized, with an AK-47 inches from his face surrounded by hostiles, could help but feel for the look of fatalism in his eyes, as if he already knew he wasn't coming back.<br><br>Seriously, just speculating here, but would it be possible his captors freed him out of goodwill to reciprocate after the recent US pull back from Falluja, and seeing he was a truck driver and not a soldier or gun-for-hire? And the US quickly spins it as an 'escape'?<br><br>It would not the first, not I believe would be the last time, the Americans have lied to the world over something that happened in Iraq. I'd like the hear Mr Hamill's side of the story, AFTER he has left Iraq.</div>
