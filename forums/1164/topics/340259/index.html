              <h1>ST Kinetics 50MG 0.50 machine gun (Singapore), Machine guns</h1>
              <p><strong>Development </strong><br> The Browning 0.50 M2 HB (Heavy Barrel) is a popular
              machine gun, but its shortcomings are well known, namely adjustment of
              the headspace, a closed-bolt firing system, a complex design and a
              subsequent high manufacturing cost. Knowing that there was still a need
              for a weapon to fill the gap between 7.62 mm machine guns and 20 mm
              cannon, Chartered Industries of Singapore (now Singapore Technologies
              Kinetics - <span style="color: #ff0000;">ST Kinetics) began designing a new 0.50 machine gun in late
              1983, with a design team led by A C Cormack</span>. The objective was a
              simpler and lighter weapon than the Browning M2 HB to improve the
              system portability and to ease the problems of field maintenance. The
              ability to fire locally produced Saboted Light Armour Penetrator (SLAP)
              Armour-Piercing Discarding-Sabot (APDS) ammunition was another
              objective.The design of the resultant machine gun, the ST Kinetics
              50MG, is simple and modular in construction, consisting of five basic
              assemblies. The modular construction allows ease of assembly and
              maintenance. The headspace is fixed removing the problems associated
              with barrel changes. There are only 210 components in the entire gun.</p>
              <p><strong>Description </strong><br> The ST Kinetics 50MG is gas-operated and fires from the
              open bolt position. The bolt carrier group is held back behind the feed
              area, and the bolt carrier is engaged by a sear. Activating the trigger
              releases the bolt carrier, and as the bolt moves forward, it strips the
              round centred on the feed tray from the ammunition belt, feeding in
              from either the left or the right side of the gun.When chambering is
              complete, the combined forward movement of the bolt carrier rotates the
              bolt by means of a cam and locks it to the barrel. The forward momentum
              of the bolt carrier assembly drives the firing pin forward to fire the
              cartridge.On firing, propellant gas is tapped off into a gas cylinder.
              The bolt carrier is driven back by the gas pistons, causing the bolt to
              rotate, unlock and extract the empty case from the chamber.As the bolt
              carrier continues to move rearward, the empty case is ejected via an
              ejection port at the bottom of the receiver. When the return springs
              are almost fully compressed, the bolt carrier begins to move forward,
              and if the pressure on the trigger is maintained, the bolt will chamber
              the next round and fire it. If the trigger is released, the bolt
              carrier assembly will be engaged by the sear. When the ammunition belt
              is exhausted, the bolt carrier group will remain in the forward closed
              position.The design is simple, and construction is modular, consisting
              of five basic groups: Receiver.....end of quote</p>

              <p>taking odds on when this thread gets locked. so far almost all of lionnoisy threads get locked. its flamebait and inflamatory junk.</p>
              <p>no loss to anyone since that they are mostly rubbish, bigotry and stupidity rolled into the most irritating package, which has absolutely no sense of phrasing.</p>
              <p>i m quoting odds of 3 to 1 this thread gets locked soon.</p>
              <p> @ lionnoisy,</p>
              <p>if i ever meet your english teacher, ild emphatize with her. i cant imagine how she/he survived marking your examination scripts with your swiss cheese logic (or UNLOGIC or Illogic if you'd accept that) and the fact that grammer is nonexistent in your threads and postings.</p>
              <p>sadly so</p>
              <p>i dont think that any school in singapore teaches people to write</p>
              <p>YES ? NO ? i dont want to hear irrelevant stuff, ONLY FACTS AND TRUTH FROMS OFFICIALZ SOURZ</p>
              <p>QUEENE !</p>
              <p>maybe i ought to write to MOE, show them our WORLD CLASS EDUCATION SYSTEM isnt working too well. you are a prime candidate that exemplifies its failings.</p>
              <p>and did i mention your phrasing ?</p>
              <p>hahaz thiz is<br><br>SAMPLE Lionnoisy posting style</p>
              <p>if you can read this</p>
              <p>proves</p>

              <p>sincz u z like to go DDDDDDDDDDDDD</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>and yes. i do contribute to the forums. like i mentioned, im stand in liontamer till SGty gets back (whenever thats soon, i m tiring of this monotonus job, its like cleaning lion droppings)</p>
              <p>although i do admit i m not going a good job as him, i learn fast.</p>
              <p>i learn that to (pretty applicable to anyone who gets irritated with lionnoisy)</p>
              <p>1) respond logically is to sublimally <strong>acknowledge </strong>the inherent stupidity in your logic and try to argue against something which is supremely flawed.</p>
              <p>2) to respond is to lend your screwed up/ swiss cheese/ Illogic/UNlogic<strong> credibility</strong></p>
              <p>3) to lend your logic credibility, in any means, is to <strong>lend you credibility</strong></p>
              <p>4) to lend you credibility, is to <strong>justify and implicitly endorse, your existence</strong> here</p>
              <p>5) to endorse your existence, would be to <strong>condone the content</strong> of your posting. which i will not do since<span style="color: #ff0000;"> i m intellectually opposed to your nonsense, morally apalled by your bigotry (and utter lack of respect and balance) and physically offended by your idiocity.</span></p>
              <p>therefore, i conclude according to these four principles, you dont deserve a coherent response. a coherent response only serves to embolden you and encourage you. Do you give liquer chocolates to a recovering alcoholic ? do you bring a recovering drug addict to his pusher ? do you allow a porno addict access to porno films ?</p>
              <p>Decartes was famous for these words, I think, therefore i am. let me borrow that and apply my understanding of that to you.</p>
              <p>you crap, therefore you are crap.</p>
              <p>its not some profound truth that needs years of meditation to
                  understand. its a brilliant simple wisdom which you'd never understand.</p>
              <p>crap dosent need acknowledgement or recognition of its existence. it deserves what it deserves, to be treated like bodily waste, flushed down the toilet or buried in a hole.</p>
              <p>out of sight, out of smell, out of existence.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>If you could appreciate the word Irony, it would well apply to this situation here since its Ironic that i m explaining this to you, fully knowing that you wont even read or dare respond to this and just continue with your nonsese.</p>
              <p>its supreme irony since you'd probably not understand it and everyone else will do.</p>
              <p>which is why i m taking the effort to make a nice little rebuttal here for you (and really meant for everyone else here)</p>

              <p>yeap.</p>
              <p>he wont bother reading it anyway. its for the others who get pissed with him anyway. he does have some interesting pictures from time to time. problem with that, is that most of them are uploaded to his photobucket account.</p>
              <p>which is somewhat considered theft even if you liberally exercise and look at copyright laws.</p>
              <p>these pictures arent new. they were previously posted in an older thread i think.</p>
