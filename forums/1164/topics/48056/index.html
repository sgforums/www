            <div class='col-md body'>Kenhor,<br>FYI, the Late? Colonel Khoo Eng An was borned in S'pore, but family moved to ROC. He joined the ROC navy and served with them for 27 years advancing to a senior position, He than returned to S'pore and was Chief of navy for 10 years between 1975 and 1985. So, the anwser to your question is yes, there have been people who served in other countries armed forces and than returned to serve in SAF.<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by kenhor:</div><div class="quote_body">Just a question first .. is it legal for a Singaporean to join a foreign army?</div></blockquote></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Winston Choo actually served 18 years. He was kept around for that long due to the following reasons:<br>a) He was loyal and not ambitious<br>b) He actually had combat experience in the Konfrontasi with Indonesia and was actually involved in jungle warfare in Borneo.<br>c) At that time, LHL had not figured out how to legitimize his power base by fast tracking scholar generals into the civil service, so there were very few generals, and those that were around were actually career professional soldiers like Choo.<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by IAF:</div><div class="quote_body">Btw, one of our first CDF LG Winston Choo served much longer ( i think 14 years).

            <div class='col-md body'>The ROC navy at that time was and still is much larger than the RSN. In addition, they have a much higher state of combat readiness due to the constant danger from China. In addition, the ROC navy has fought small scale engagements with communist chinese held islands, etc. As a ranking officer in the ROC navy, Khoo was eminently qualified to lead the RSN, and was definitely head and shoulders above the next candidate. Such a person should be employed for as long as possible.<br>The more important question was why was he even hired in the first placed? What if he was sending information back to his former employers in the ROC on the future RSN strategy? Can someone really trust an individual who gave his allegiance to another country's armed forces for 27 years?<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by Icemoon:</div><div class="quote_body">How come his tour of duty as Chief of Navy lasted 10 years?

Small matters like assault however will not necessarily prevent you from joining.<br><br>Some people here asked why joing the FFL if you can get more $$ in the SAF !! That really shows how you have no idea on one's motivation to join the FFL. Give me a break about the French passport thing... there are large numbers of American, British and German in the FFL, you think they are there for the passport?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>Let me tell you why some American ex-USMC, Brit ex-RM, etc... go and join the Legion: because they want to know what it is to have a REAL soldier life.

When the regular army is sent to fight it's normal but when it's the Legion then they become mercenaries ? You should cut on Jean-Claude Vandamme movies my friend... it is clouding your judgement. The Legionnaires are not expendable, they are trained to fight so that's what they do when it's their duty to do so, what is so difficult to understand about that ?<br><br>I suggest you visit some website aout the FFL, there are a lot, written by ex-legionnaire, in English.

Small matters like assault however will not necessarily prevent you from joining.<br><br>Some people here asked why joing the FFL if you can get more $$ in the SAF !! That really shows how you have no idea on one's motivation to join the FFL. Give me a break about the French passport thing... there are large numbers of American, British and German in the FFL, you think they are there for the passport?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>Let me tell you why some American ex-USMC, Brit ex-RM, etc... go and join the Legion: because they want to know what it is to have a REAL soldier life. There is no PC bullshit in the Legion and how can you claim to be a real soldier if you never see real action ?<br><br>In your opinion zigzag, what is your % of chance of seeing real action in the SAF compared to the Legion, hmm ??  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>The Legionnaire are not mercenaries, where did you get this stupid idea from ? When the regular army is sent to fight it's normal but when it's the Legion then they become mercenaries ? You should cut on Jean-Claude Vandamme movies my friend... it is clouding your judgement. The Legionnaires are not expendable, they are trained to fight so that's what they do when it's their duty to do so, what is so difficult to understand about that ?<br><br>I suggest you visit some website aout the FFL, there are a lot, written by ex-legionnaire, in English. That will be an eye-opener for you.</div></blockquote>Yep pay in the Leigon is pretty crap.But the leigon used to be made up of the social rejects.Now however thing are different.The Leigon's police actually conduct background checks using Interpol.<br>Well the French have a saying....For every leigon dead it's 1 french man alive.For now though the leigon is the rapid depolyment force of the french army to compliment the Para's.Also some ex-service people from other counties join the Leigon because they had been released from their respective army and they cannot find employment anywhere else as they had spent their life in the service.(Mostly school drop outs lah)So they join the leigon to find empolyment.This was widespread after the Falkark war.</div>
