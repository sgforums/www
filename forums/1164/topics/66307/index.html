Scrutinize ST Technologies, do you have any idea how much money they fleece SAF for??!!<br><br>3. Make black tape standard issue for every person in the SAF, the unending uses of blacktape to solve military problems (like getting our F-16 Sidewinder missiles to stick on the plyons) will save tons of cash.<br><br>4. Cut the pay of a certain member of the monarchy who is in the military by 5 percent, we can have enough cash to buy 5 more Stealth Frigates and the like.<br><br>5. Hire PRCs in our army, they are willing to work far cheaper then conscripts.<br><br>6. Use pickup trucks with .50cal and stuff mounted on them (technicals) to replace our 350 SM1 tanks, probably far more effective and cheaper as well.
