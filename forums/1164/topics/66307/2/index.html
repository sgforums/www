Well the facts out are as figures.<br><br>The death rate, despite heavy fighting was only SEVEN a day, the lowest rate ever for major combat in recorded history. Of all the allied soldiers killed, most of them were killed by hits to unprotected parts of their body (face, neck and legs) and almost no deaths were caused by torso hits (the most common cause of death in combat). Only in unusual cases where the bullet entered by an odd angle and bypassed the vest or a hit by a large caliber weapon was a torso injury caused.<br><br>By comparism, most of the iraqi wounded the allies treated suffered from torso injuries which effectively put them out of the fight. In many cases an allied soldier was hit by a bullet and knocked down, and back in the fight the next instant. Does body armour work and save lives? The answer is yes, and it works very well.<br><br>Go back further in history and note that many of the rangers who were wounded or killed in the battle of the black sea (black hawk down incident), were so because they opted to remove the composite plates in their ranger body armour to save weight, that would have saved them from an AK 47 round. Most telling was the case of Sgt. Casey Joyce, who was shot from the back by an AK 47, the bullet ruptured his heart and he died. He had left out his back plate and the round penetrated his vest, ironically, to embed itself in the front of this vest, where he did keep a plate. This incident was reproduced in the movie, if you saw it.<br><br>Body armour in military applications works, and saves lives. And not wearing them during peacetime does not make sense, as we need to train out troops to get used to using them.<br><br>Why neglect using body armour and sustain a 70 percent higher loss of life? So many people needlessly lost because they did not wear their protective equipment. People who could had fought on and given the enemy trouble, people who have families and loved ones.</div>

Can you be sure that you will not take a hit? And if you do, what is the most likely area? Your torso (70 percent likelyhood). And if you have a torso injury, you can be sure it's gonna be quite bad, if not fatal. Almost every kind of critical equipment that keeps you alive in packed in that part of your body.</div></blockquote>Hmm, there is no doubt about the effectiveness of body armour, but which one have you read you can intro ti us here? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"></div>

BA will certainly cut KIA or the severity of WIAs from battlefield hazards.<br><br>If you want to pick an older war to figure out the effectiveness of BA in a more "conventional" war. Try vietnam, when the flack jacket saved about an estimated 2000 lives, and this was the old flack jacket, before there was kevlar, and it was designed to stop shell fragments, not AK 47 bullets. Even then it work pretty well, even if it was not standard issue.<br><br>As for the gung ho issue, an idiot will be an idiot, no matter what, BA or not. But level headed soldiers like you and me of course will take it in its context. Body Armour will make us more confident and concentrate more on doing our job instead of worrying about getting hit. As the americans discovered during Iraqi Freedom, that there was a significant morale advantage provided by body armour, where troops were more calm and confident in the fight.<br><br>In fact, the current trouble the british army is facing is that they did <span style="font-style: italic;">not</span> have enough pieces of BA to go around as they are highly coverted. In fact, they have already suffered well known KIA who was killed because he gave off his vest when ordered to higher risk troops and later was wounded fatally in an incident in which his BA would have saved his life. I think combat wise, BA has proven itself very well, so well that now the military of countries who use them are not trying to get rid of it, but is instead finding themselves critically short of it.<br><br>If this 5-6 kg thing did not work as well as it did, it would have been dumped straight away, but apparently the exact opposite happened. Allied troops are now using it for many things, from protecting themselves to lining the doors and floors of their soft skinned hummers to provide them some armour, imagine that!<br><br>Of course, BA itself will not cut KIAs if your troops are plain badly trained and do not know how to take cover. Hence it is important to train troopers how to find cover, move under cover, and learn to mvoe around the battlefield without getting exposed. Mix Body Armour in along with that skill, you get soldiers that are a lot harder to kill then your average Iraqi Conscript.<br><br>So yes, I think BA is a very good idea!</div>
