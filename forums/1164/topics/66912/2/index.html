The aircraft can do a lot but the human in the system is a great limiting factor.<br><br>Sooner or later we'll realize that it's far cheaper and effective to take the pilot out of the plane altogether. Unhindered by a mortal human, a UCAV is limited only by the strength of its materials and processing power, capable of doing things that manned aircraft can only dream of. In fact, there's really little distinction between a UCAV and a cruise missile except that the UCAV returns to base.<br><br>Why risk man and machine (esp. man) in a slow, limited expensive machine encumbered with so much equipment just to keep the meat (which is already at the peak of human endurance) alive to fire a few missiles, snap a few photos and drop a few bombs when robot planes can do it with far lower cost and risk and with a far greater preformance as well?</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>This discussion on unmanned aircrafts reminded me of Michael Crichton's book "Prey".<br><br>I do think if technology allows us to build "cheap" and semi intelligent aircrafts - then this concept really can take off. The predator's missions in Iraq was a experiment and that one that was used to take out terrorists in Yemen was another example. I read from one of the israeli linked sites that there are disposable unmanned drones that are launched from a platoon level for platoon level intel. (looks like a bazooka). These are all interesting and great - but it takes money and time to bring us there.<br><br>A more interim strategy would always be to have a complimentary role for unmanned and manned aircrafts even as the unmanned portion increases as technology pushes the boundaries.</div>

Airborne minefields - give them a X,Y Z to loiter over and attack anything metallic that moves. Then you don't need operation "Market Garden" well at least the market part.</div>
