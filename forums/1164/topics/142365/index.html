IMO, American interference actually gave those militants more reasons to fight on. In the process of toppling a dictator (Saddam Hussein), they created one more terorist (Mussab Al-Zarqawi). Should have best left things as they were. The Iraqi people would one day bring down Saddam by their own hand.</div>

Yeah, like that will work.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"></div>
