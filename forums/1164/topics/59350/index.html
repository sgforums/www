The LST or correctly the LPD has not been designed with that in mind. It was design to provide greater troop lift with smaller crew as a replacement of the WWII LSTs. The heli pad was always not designed for VTOL like harriers.<br><br>If RSN &amp; RSAF are keen to push Singapore into the "aircraft carrier" club, it would require a new class of ship like the Italian San Gorgio or a very much scaled down LHD like a small version of  USS WASP or HMS Ocean, by which case, our neighbours will sure to scream that Singapore is starting an arm race in the region. Besides, having the necessary resource to firstly purchase such a vessel and then operate it, plus the crews and aircrafts are so great. I doubt Mindef can justify such a budget unless they can justify the needs. I think the new subs will probably have a higher priority.<br><br></div>

Sure, the ships have a good air traffic control, it must have refuelling capability. Maybe some sort of weapons might be carried onboard, but to use it for marine style CAS air ops is near impractical given such as small landing area.<br><br>San Giorgio is much better for the role you have mentioned, and the Endurance could be used in conjunction with a "RSN San Giorgio type" vessel to conduct a limited CAS ops while doing some beach assault if that is why you mean. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>I am amazed at how good the LPDs are especially built locally by ST Marine albeit based on a scaled down US design. Their usefulness is unquestionable, their capabilities proven. But to use it as mini LHD is almost insane.  If the flight deck is twice as long and 50% widder, perhaps, so.<br><br>What I would like to see (in my dreams though), is ST Marine's hovercraft being used in conjunction with the landing crafts. That would really be cool.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>No, it is not bullshitting at all. Look at Taiwan's IDF. They call it indigenous design, but hey, they will have no plane if not for Lockheed Martin design assistance. In many sense, the IDF looks like and feel like a scaled down F-16. Look at Japanese F2 as another example.  You can further refer to Indian LCA with lots of help from other foreign countries, Chinese J-10 in fact is a copy of Lavi, not to mention Lavi itself is based on the Viper's design. There you go, as long as high percentage of the design, including the interior fit out, structural layout, and majoring of the ship is designed locally by ST Marine, then intial design based on some existing design and modifying it is NOT consider a copy or non-indigenious. I think ST Marine has done well and should be proud to call it indigenous design. Period.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by Joe Black:</div><div class="quote_body">If RSN &amp; RSAF are keen to push Singapore into the "aircraft carrier" club, it would require a new class of ship like the Italian San Gorgio or a very much scaled down LHD like a small version of  USS WASP or HMS Ocean, by which case, our neighbours will sure to scream that Singapore is starting an arm race in the region. Besides, having the necessary resource to firstly purchase such a vessel and then operate it, plus the crews and aircrafts are so great. I doubt Mindef can justify such a budget unless they can justify the needs. I think the new subs will probably have a higher priority.<br><br></div></blockquote>Well, Thailand didn't seem to get much flak when they got their carrier, altho it hasn't been doing much the past few years. I would say the political implications if singapore was to get a small carrier would be manageable, especially if there is a second-hand one available. One can always argue that we can use it for humanitarian missions as such since carriers are essentially multi-mission capable. Some carriers, such as the Invincible class, can even act as floating hospitals.<br><br>However, i do agree with u, Joeblack, in that the biggest obstacle is manpower and cost. I also agree with the fact that we have no need for such a ship as yet. Besides, the creation of a carrier task group is a huge undertaking requiring new doctrines, procedures and equipment. In other words, it would be overkill. The money can be better spent elsewhere.<br><br>My 0.5 cent worth.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"></div>

If you look at the MCVs, it has pretty much the same issue as you have just said, but the Baraks are still mounted on the deck. When and if RSN wants Barak, I am sure that necessary reinforcement beams will be added inside the area to support the weight of the VLS. Furthermore, the two front doors just provide access to maintain the VLS systems even better.<br><br>Having said all these, I still reckon the LST needs not just the Baraks, but also a CIWS. Love to see a couple of 20mm or 0.5s pint mounted to hit anything that speeds towards the LST in an unfriendly way, or floating sea mines, not to mentioned as AA guns as well.</div>
