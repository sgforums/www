            <div class='col-md body'>3 of 3 debunked. 1) No WMDs 2) Not for the War on Terror and 3) Not for freedom and democracy for Iraqis<br><br>--------------------------------------<br><br><a href="http://www.time.com/time/world/article/0,8599,642825,00.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.time.com/time/world/article/0,8599,642825,00.html</a><br><br><strong>Why al-Qaeda Thrives</strong><br><br>President Bush says Iraq is the central front in the war on terror, but security experts say Iraq is the reason Bin Laden's movement is growing<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">By TONY KARON </span><br><br>Whether or not a decent outcome is eventually achieved, Iraq won't present President Bush with the triumphant centerpiece of a successful reelection campaign. Still, Americans' fear of terror remains a rich seam of political support for the president Â— indeed, recent polls indicate that while more Americans believe his presumptive challenger, Senator John Kerry, would do a better job handling Iraq, Bush has a significant lead when the question is who would do a better job of fighting terrorism. Not surprisingly, then, the president's handlers have sought to make terrorism the prism through which the Bush presidency must be viewed Â— even when the conversation turns to Iraq.<br><br>President Bush framed his Monday keynote address on Iraq around the idea that the country is now "the central front in the war on terror." He implied that the invasion of Iraq was a choice forced on the U.S. by the Sept. 11 attacks and that the enemy facing the U.S. there shares al-Qaeda's goal of establishing "Taliban-type" rule. In all, he used the words "terror" or "terrorist/terrorism" 19 times. But the president's characterization will hardly have resonated with his Iraqi audience, who see al-Qaeda as a problem brought into their country by the U.S. invasion rather than by Saddam Hussein. <strong>Even the U.S. intelligence community has long maintained that Saddam's regime had no connection with the 9/11 attacks, while U.S. commanders on the ground in Iraq say that foreign terrorists constitute only a small fraction of the insurgency facing Coalition troops there</strong>.<br><br>If, indeed, there is a connection between Iraq and al-Qaeda, it may not be the kind the Bush campaign is likely to dwell on. The same day the President spoke, the prestigious International Institute for Strategic Studies released its annual survey that found, among other things, that <strong>far from dealing a blow to al-Qaeda and making the U.S. and its allies safer, the Iraq invasion has in fact substantially strengthened bin Laden's network and increased the danger of attacks in the West. </strong>And the London-based IISS is not some Bush-bashing antiwar think tank; it hosted the president's keynote address during his embattled visit to the British late last year.<br><br><strong>The IISS reported that al-Qaeda's recruitment and fundraising efforts had been given a major boost by the U.S. invasion of Iraq. </strong>It estimated that bin Laden's network today commands some 18,000 men, of which about 1,000 are currently inside Iraq. After almost three years of President Bush's war on terror, the IISS offered the following assessment of the movement's prospects: <strong>"Although half of al-Qaeda's 30 senior leaders and perhaps 2,000 rank-and-file members have been killed or captured, a rump leadership is still intact and more than 18,000 potential terrorists are still at large, with recruitment accelerating on account of Iraq." </strong>The continuing danger of an al-Qaeda strike inside the U.S. as it moves into election season was underscored Wednesday by Attorney General John Ashcroft, who warned that intelligence tips suggest that the movement plans to attack inside the U.S. some time in the coming months. It was a non-specific warning, of course, and the color-coded terror alert level was not raised as a result. But the announcement affirmed for Americans the fact that they remain vulnerable to al-Qaeda attack, if better prepared and forewarned than three years ago.<br><br>So why is al-Qaeda continuing to grow and prosper despite the loss of its Afghan sanctuaries and so many of its personnel, and the fact that it has been relentlessly hounded by security services across Europe, the Middle East and Southeast Asia? The consensus among security analysts is that <strong>the key to eliminating al-Qaeda as a threat is to transform the permissive political environment in which it operates in the Muslim world. Instead, the opposite has occurred Â— Muslim anger at the U.S. has reached an all-time high and continues to grow, driven by outrage at U.S. actions in Iraq and Afghanistan, and by Israel's actions against the Palestinians. </strong> The precipitous decline in support or sympathy for the U.S. in the Muslim world after 9/11 has meant fertile ground for al-Qaeda recruiters.<br><br>Authoritative voices from the IISS to former U.S. commander for the Mideast and Bush administration envoy to the region General Anthony Zinni to Anthony Cordesman of the Center for Strategic and International Studies have lately warned that <strong>the achievement of U.S. goals in the Middle East depends on its ability to revive and complete the Israeli-Palestinian peace process.</strong> The administration's approach has been to leave that issue on the back burner while pursuing Iraq on the assumption that ousting Saddam's regime would facilitate peace between Israel and the Palestinians Â— an argument dismissed as spurious by Zinni, Cordesman and others. Instead, the Iraq occupation and the ongoing conflict in the West Bank and Gaza has burnished al-Qaeda's appeal in relation to the pro-U.S. Arab regimes it hopes to supplant, because these regimes appear powerless to affect the plight of the Palestinians and Iraqis. With seemingly no Arab leaders capable of protecting Arab interests, bin Laden paints himself and his politics of suicidal jihad as the path to redeeming Islam's lost honor.<br><br>While al-Qaeda's appeal in the Arab and Muslim world has grown in the years since 9/11, the group has not mounted a single attack in the U.S. in the same period. Bin Laden's goals are to rally Muslims to the cause of jihad, in order to drive the U.S. and its influence out of the Islamic world and restore the Islamic empire of the Middle Ages. And <strong>the antagonism provoked by U.S. actions such as invading Iraq have been more effective even than the terror of 9/11 in building support for the movement. </strong>Still, al-Qaeda continues to seek to mount mass-casualty terror attacks in the U.S. It has been hampered by the U.S.-led crackdown on its organizational structures, and by the domestic security efforts that have made operations across such great distances more difficult. Al-Qaeda will necessarily have had to put new leadership and communication protocols in place, and its decentralization and dispersion may have changed the very nature of its operations. It has continued to strike in Europe and Asia, and of course Iraq. But now the Bush administration is warning that it plans to attack in the U.S. too, in time to have an impact on the election.<br><br>The last al-Qaeda terror strike on U.S. soil rallied the overwhelming majority of Americans strongly behind President Bush. Whether and how a new terror strike on U.S. soil three years later might do the same remains to be seen. But whereas the 9/11 attack shocked and horrified much of the international community, including the Arab and Muslim world, and drew them initially closer to Washington, it's unlikely that a new attack would do much to reverse the deep polarization of the international community brought on by the war in Iraq.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Iraq was an issue even before the US invasion last year. There was widespread Muslim anger at the UN sanctions that were slowly but surely killing off Iraqis by denying them adequate food and medicine. As justification for declaring war on the US, Osama not only brought up the Palestinian issue but also that of the Iraqi sanctions. The US never invade, they complain already. The US invade, they complain even more. They are better complainers than Singaporeans.<br><br>Now that Saddam is gone and the opportunity for building a new Iraq exists, the Muslim fundamentalists themselves are sabotaging the future of their own brothers in Iraq. Quite funny how many people think prisoner abuse is shocking but somehow seem to condone the suicide bombings in Iraq as heroic acts of resistance.</div>

Many of them saw through the lies and deception spouted by Bush and his lackeys, and decided they wanted no part of this immoral war, good as removing Saddam might be, even before the war. They questioned the assessments on WMDs. They argued against violating international law based on questionable "evidence". They warned against invading and nation-building half-cocked with an emaciated force. They wondered if Iraqis will really be all that happy about having foreign troops running all over their country. But noooo...Bushy-boy wanted Iraq, and damn the consequences because they wouldn't happen because he felt they wouldn't.<br><br>The neocons can spout all they want about the good removing Saddam was, the fact remains that:<br><br>1) The justifications of the war is wrong<br>2) Al-Qaeda has been given a respite and is becoming stronger<br>3)The plight of Iraqis is NOT better.

            <div class='col-md body'>Invading Iraq has made the world a more dangerous place yes, because it has created a new Afghanistan. A symbol of 'injustice' that has become a powerful rallying call for jihad. The world can fuck Bush and his neo-cons for all they want but they must realise this: Once Iraq descends into anarchy, Al-Qaeda will transform Iraq into a full-fledged Afghanistan. Then, it'll not only have symbolic value like now. It'll also have functional value with training camps, radical Islamic govt etc. Al-Qaeda knows this and this is exactly why they're doing all they can to get the US out.<br><br>Yes, Bush is probably wrong to go in there but since he's there now, there's no turning back. We cannot afford to fail in Iraq. While we criticise the US for its arrogance, we must acknowledge the importance of the task they are doing there now and give them support for it. Otherwise, it'll be a case of deja vu all over again.<br>Afghanistan Reloaded.</div>

Let's help..(or at least hope) that the US can do their job in rebuilding Iraq..coz if they fail..it's the future of the Iraq and their people thats in jeopady. (and Bush's credibility of course).<br><br>As for saddam, can't say he posed any immediate danger to the world before he fell, but i think there's no doubt he did pose some form of danger..3 wars were of his doing..gassed the Kurds (already historical facts, even the UN dosen't dispute it) what makes people so sure that he won't do that again if he has the chance?<br><br>And also, talk about sanctions most of the world has been imposing on saddam ond north korea's Kim. Containment seem to work...but is it really working? Some essential supplies like some types of  medicine and chemicals are held back because of the fear that he could weaponise them, oil is traded for food according to proportion (or am i wrong?) prior to the case for war..2001--2003 we may not hear so much of starvation or lack of medical supplies, but does it mean they arn't there? It seems to me that the world is trying too hard to co-exist or tolerate these people (eg. saddam).<br>I'm no spokesperson for Bush though..<br><br>I think the WMD thing was used just to make a case for the war..but hey, if you look at the "ends justifying the means" point of view..at least there is some good of all of this.<br><br>But what do you people think was the REAL reason behind the invasion anyway?

Some even speak of the need to cultivate a US empire. Neoconservatives believe modern threats facing the US can no longer be reliably contained and therefore must be prevented, sometimes through preemptive military action.<br><br>Most neocons believe that the US has allowed dangers to gather by not spending enough on defense and not confronting threats aggressively enough. One such threat, they contend, was Saddam Hussein and his pursuit of weapons of mass destruction. Since the 1991 Gulf War, neocons relentlessly advocated Mr. Hussein's ouster.<br><br>Most neocons share unwavering support for Israel, which they see as crucial to US military sufficiency in a volatile region. They also see Israel as a key outpost of democracy in a region ruled by despots. Believing that authoritarianism and theocracy have allowed anti-Americanism to flourish in the Middle East, neocons advocate the democratic transformation of the region, starting with Iraq. They also believe the US is unnecessarily hampered by multilateral institutions, which they do not trust to effectively neutralize threats to global security.<br><br>What are the roots of neoconservative beliefs?<br>The original neocons were a small group of mostly Jewish liberal intellectuals who, in the 1960s and 70s, grew disenchanted with what they saw as the American left's social excesses and reluctance to spend adequately on defense. Many of these neocons worked in the 1970s for Democratic Senator Henry "Scoop" Jackson, a staunch anti-communist. By the 1980s, most neocons had become Republicans, finding in President Ronald Reagan an avenue for their aggressive approach of confronting the Soviet Union with bold rhetoric and steep hikes in military spending. After the Soviet Union's fall, the neocons decried what they saw as American complacency. In the 1990s, they warned of the dangers of reducing both America's defense spending and its role in the world.<br><br>Unlike their predecessors, most younger neocons never experienced being left of center. They've always been "Reagan" Republicans.<br><br>What is the difference between a neoconservative and a conservative?<br><br>Liberals first applied the "neo" prefix to their comrades who broke ranks to become more conservative in the 1960s and 70s. The defectors remained more liberal on some domestic policy issues. But foreign policy stands have always defined neoconservatism. Where other conservatives favored dÃ©tente and containment of the Soviet Union, neocons pushed direct confrontation, which became their raison d'etre during the 1970s and 80s.<br><br>Today, both conservatives and neocons favor a robust US military. But most conservatives express greater reservations about military intervention and so-called nation building. Neocons share no such reluctance. The post 9/11-campaigns against regimes in Afghanistan and Iraq demonstrate that the neocons are not afraid to force regime change and reshape hostile states in the American image. Neocons believe the US must do to whatever it takes to end state-supported terrorism. For most, this means an aggressive push for democracy in the Middle East. Even after 9/11, many other conservatives, particularly in the isolationist wing, view this as an overzealous dream with nightmarish consequences.<br><br>How have neoconservatives influenced US foreign policy?<br><br>Finding a kindred spirit in President Reagan, neocons greatly influenced US foreign policy in the 1980s.<br><br>But in the 1990s, neocon cries failed to spur much action. Outside of Reaganite think tanks and Israel's right-wing Likud Party, their calls for regime change in Iraq were deemed provocative and extremist by the political mainstream. With a few notable exceptions, such as President Bill Clinton's decision to launch isolated strikes at suspected terrorist targets in Afghanistan and Sudan in 1998, their talk of preemptive military action was largely dismissed as overkill.<br><br>Despite being muted by a president who called for restraint and humility in foreign affairs, neocons used the 1990s to hone their message and craft their blueprint for American power. Their forward thinking and long-time ties to Republican circles helped many neocons win key posts in the Bush administration.<br><br>The terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001 moved much of the Bush administration closer than ever to neoconservative foreign policy. Only days after 9/11, one of the top neoconservative think tanks in Washington, the Project for a New American Century, wrote an open letter to President Bush calling for regime change in Iraq. Before long, Bush, who campaigned in 2000 against nation building and excessive military intervention overseas, also began calling for regime change in Iraq. In a highly significant nod to neocon influence, Bush chose the American Enterprise Institute (AEI) as the venue for a key February 2003 speech in which he declared that a US victory in Iraq "could begin a new stage for Middle Eastern peace." AEI Â– the de facto headquarters for neconservative policy Â– had been calling for democratization of the Arab world for more than a decade.<br><br>What does a neoconservative dream world look like?<br><br>Neocons envision a world in which the United States is the unchallenged superpower, immune to threats. They believe that the US has a responsibility to act as a "benevolent global hegemon." In this capacity, the US would maintain an empire of sorts by helping to create democratic, economically liberal governments in place of "failed states" or oppressive regimes they deem threatening to the US or its interests. In the neocon dream world the entire Middle East would be democratized in the belief that this would eliminate a prime breeding ground for terrorists. This approach, they claim, is not only best for the US; it is best for the world. In their view, the world can only achieve peace through strong US leadership backed with credible force, not weak treaties to be disrespected by tyrants.<br><br>Any regime that is outwardly hostile to the US and could pose a threat would be confronted aggressively, not "appeased" or merely contained. The US military would be reconfigured around the world to allow for greater flexibility and quicker deployment to hot spots in the Middle East, as well as Central and Southeast Asia. The US would spend more on defense, particularly for high-tech, precision weaponry that could be used in preemptive strikes. It would work through multilateral institutions such as the United Nations when possible, but must never be constrained from acting in its best interests whenever necessary.<br></div>

A symbol of 'injustice' that has become a powerful rallying call for jihad. The world can fuck Bush and his neo-cons for all they want but they must realise this: Once Iraq descends into anarchy, Al-Qaeda will transform Iraq into a full-fledged Afghanistan. Then, it'll not only have symbolic value like now. It'll also have functional value with training camps, radical Islamic govt etc. Al-Qaeda knows this and this is exactly why they're doing all they can to get the US out.<br><br>Yes, Bush is probably wrong to go in there but since he's there now, there's no turning back. We cannot afford to fail in Iraq. While we criticise the US for its arrogance, we must acknowledge the importance of the task they are doing there now and give them support for it. Otherwise, it'll be a case of deja vu all over again.<br>Afghanistan Reloaded. </div></blockquote>I have no doubt of this fact, nor do I wish for the US to pullout or to lose in Iraq. The consequences of that would be terrible for the world. Neither am I interested in "I told you so" to the pro-war gallery.<br><br>But that is the exact reason why I'm pissed to death of the actions of the Americans. Yes, Saddam had to go, but surely that could be waited till Al-Qaeda was weakened even further. At the very least, with Saddam in charge, no way in hell Al-Qaeda would run wild in Iraq.<br><br>But take a look at current US actions in Iraq. Is it working towards that end which it claims to be working towards? It is playing favourites and sidelining groups who MUST have a say in the process of nation-building in Iraq. They must work with people like Ayatollah al-Sistani (to sideline Sadr) in Southern Iraq and even the Sunni groups who fervently resist them in places like Falluja and Ramadi. And no most of them are not Al-Qaeda, they just do not want to be marginalized in the new Iraq and American actions are doing precisely that.<br><br>Winning the peace in Iraq will not be accomplished by M1A2s, JDAMs and bullets. It will be won by Bush first admitting he was wrong to invade, to put a truly representative Iraqi government in place and cedeing control of Iraq to the UN with American troops serving under a UN banner. The UN has many faults, but at the very least, it is a lot more of an honest broker than the Americans.<br><br>And one last thing, get the "contractors" out of Iraq.
