              <p>Cos he always post dumb things mah... that one is not half bad... the funny part is that he tries to stick to his guns despite knowing next to nothing about military technology except anything that is made by ST or anything this is published in the media about ADF "blunders" and throw in the funny english to the mix.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>But seriously, he has always been silent about if he has served his NS, or what he served as despite it having being asked several times... wonder what's up with that. But he does not strike me as a person who really knows that the grunt life is about, considering his outlook on military technology (locally made especially) seems somewhat fantasy and overly-optimistic, and that the average ADF soldier has the intelligence of the Battlefield 2 AI bots.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>All in all he's a pretty funny character. Like one of those things that are nice to have around to relieve stress by having him entertain you with his overly-entu-Singapore-boleh stuff.</p>

              <blockquote>DSO's Extender drone is adapted from a <strong>commercially available remote-controlled plane that costs about <span style="color: #ff0000;">$1,000, a fraction of the price of specialised UAVs.<br></span></strong>DSO added cameras to the Extender so soldiers can use it to survey unknown territory.<br>Mr Lim found that making different electronic components work together is a key challenge when adapting the small, hand-held UAV for military use. 'The components worked<br>fine individually, but when we put them together, they didn't work because the signals interfered with one another,' he said.<br>After some calculations and some trial and error, the sensors on the 1.6kg plane worked well enough for DSO to demonstrate it at a Singapore Armed Forces<br>urban warfare experiment last February....

              <p>Thinker ? You do not even think at all !!!</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>By the way  when they say <strong>commercially available remote-controlled plane they are talking about those hobbyist remote control toy planes those cost $1000. </strong></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>Those are limited in range, speed , weight and attitude !!! Let not even talk about enemy jet planes - even enemy propeller planes will be so fast and higher then your remote-control toy planes even dream to reach. </strong></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Do not even suggest that it can fly all the way to enemy airfield to take out enemy planes. Why it does not have range - because with limit payload - it cannot carry enough fuel and equipment enough for it be able to control to be fly there !!! </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Even if you penetrate to outside the airfield by ground !!! your $1000 toy does not have the payload or the pentration speed to knock out a plane sitting on the ground. Even if you did, it will take out just 1 plane..... only .... if i can bloody penetrate to the enemy airfield to that range - I may as well have carry a small bloody motar system which can take out more planes and bloody cheaper !!!</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Again maybe we just broadcast your "thinker ideals" on air - maybe enemy pilots will laugh so much that that they lost control their planes and crashed !!!!!</p>
              <p> </p>

              <p>This difference between you and me is this: unlike you I have fired shaped charged HEAT warheads and lobbed High Explosive Dual Purpose fragmentation warheads before and am quite familiar with what it can and cannot do.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>And it's quite simple... what you are trying to imagine is that using keywords like FRAGMENTATION and SHAPED CHARGED will solve the glaring holes in your fantasy, but I can assure you I not only know these effects far better then you, I have trained in them and used them as well. And this is why your UAV idea will not work (or at the very least if we wanted to use our UAVs as an attack platform, it will not be done your way)</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The shaped charge effect is not the solve-all to all your armour problems. It is just a way of focusing an explosion in order to penetrate armour but at the end of the day you still need the right amount of explosives to get the job done. To little and you will not penetrate the target. </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>And what's more it is not enough to just penetrate the target, you have to have sufficent after-armour effects in order to destroy it.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Go do the math... in a PROPER heavy antitank system, the shaped charge weapon itself can be up to 8 kilos or more. Cluster munitions rely on using multiple hits to disable their targets, for one hit is not usually sufficent to cause enough damage.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>As for fragmentation have you fired a HEDP before? There is a reason why arty shells, which is a far larger fragmentation warhead are invented and are used.</p>
              <p> </p>

              </blockquote>
              <p>A single 5.56mm bullet, with good battlefield tatics is enough to take out an enemy fighter. For some reason you seem to envision swarms of UAVs used piecemeal against enemy targets.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Even one single arty shell which has FAR, FAR more explosives then your UAV idea in a fragmentation package, is cheaper, faster, more destructive, and easier then Extender.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Also, suicide UAVs are virtually useless against enemy fighters who have taken cover in a building shooting through potholes when a far cheaper 40mm grenade mailed through the opening can cause far more damage.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Also, you are asking our soldiers to carry a UAV, it's fuel, maintain it in the field and learn how to operate it, and all that just to send a small bit of explosives on a difficult to use, slow, expensive (relative to the explosives being sent), and vulnerable system with limited loiter time to the enemy?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>If I was the enemy this is what I will do... the moment the UAVs are launched against my troops, I would simply jam them, home back to the source of the signals and call for arty fire or a straight on infanty assault against the positions.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>In the meantime, our SAF soldiers listening to your idea will be quickly made hamburger.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>What's more, you have to train the troops in the using of the UAV, account for failures (which is very common if you are out in the field with complex technology), account for the logistics (fuel and all that stuff), terrain (suicide UAV is useless in heavy jungle or urban overhead cover where a normal shell will simply plow through) and then manufacture enough of that stuff to actually make a difference... when already we can train the grunt to use a 40mm grenade launcher or work properly with fire support elements like mortar, airpower, and arty. </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Note the main problem the UAV is trying to solve for the grunt is "what's over that hill?", not "how do i kill it?"... killing it is hardly the problem and we are more then equipped to do it PROPERLY.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Are you sure you are not really working for the enemy with all your "ideas"?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Do yourself a favour and let your fantasy die... the people in here not only know UAVs better then you, they also know how it can and cannot be used, and how it shall be used. We all know how UAVs can be used to attack (and that is in the proper UCAV role), but for some reason you don't seem to and keep insisting on a rather inpratical form of combat that seems to think that the enemy is as smart as Battlefield 2 bots.</p>

              <p>LOL, the whole question is... why crash UAVs when I can use it to watch my butt when I can take out far more targets with a anti-material sniper rifle. The UAV isn't really light to carry, we can only bring one of it per team, is not that easy to operate, and works far better as an eye in the sky.</p>

              <p>If you want to avoid the issue at the very least don't try to post meaningless posts... it just shows that you lack intellectual intergity, or basic comprehension skills.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The question is do you think it's a good idea for the SAF to crash such things into people and equipment, something that you have been pushing for since this whole sorry thread started, a thread that no doubt exposed you lack of understanding on most things even most basic book camp.</p>

              <p>Is there any lionnoisy with the english skill that can finish this book? I dunt think so!!</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>As to answer your question on if there's any other UAV with the size so small:</p>

              <p>All smaller then Fantail.... and made by many other countries.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>So please tooting our horn about Fantail, you are disgracing our country with your lack of understanding of even our OWN equipment.</p>

              <p>Not with the way it currently is... 400 grams is just too small a payload to heft a robot sniper system of any caliber. A sniper rifle typically weights up to 10 times that.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Robot sniper systems do exist, and they shoot far better then any existing sniper. But being a sniper involves more then just shooting- you have to get to the target, stay hidden and all that stuff.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>As for if I think they will ever mount sniper systems on UAVs... not the unguided form I think... missiles are simply more versitile and reliable (in terms of hitting stuff after being launched from an airborne platform), and in many ways the current application of Predator armed with hellfires in Iraq/Afganistan to take out unsuspecting targets is probably what we could call high-tech sniping. </p>

              <p>1) payload - too heavy as something that can shoot bullet to a certain distance of at least 100m is too heavy for it. <br>2)Also for firing a bullet and wanting it to fly over 100m - you need a barrel of certain length which will affect the flight of it.<br>3) it is too unstable in flight to to aim to shoot.<br>4) frankly with sniper rifle able to handle 1KM shoots nowadays... you do not need something to fly that close.
