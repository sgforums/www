            <div class='col-md body'>I was wondering wat dictates the number of smoke grenade launchers to be fixed on each side of the vehicles.?Like SAF seems to put 3 lauchers on each side. But Malaysia's PT-91 seems to have more than 3 on each side, the same for other countries armoured vehicles. Wad other type of ammunitions can be fired from it? can it be reloaded from inside the vehicle?</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Its a single use smoke grenade launcher.  Cannot be reloaded from the vehicle itself.  No other ammunition besides smoke.<br><br>Purpose is used to cover (smoke out) a retreat, so the enemy doesnt have a clear shot of the vehicle trying to get away.

I've read that in many places but don't know if this is more effective than smoke dischargers.</blockquote>Generating smoke in this manner is a (relatively) simple matter of injecting diesel fuel into the exhaust manifold in a controlled amount.  Off the top of my head, I know that the Chally 2 and M60A3 can do this ... seen it on video.  I'm sure the complete list is likely to be much longer than that.<br><br>The difference between smoke from diesel smoke generators and smoke grenade launchers is a matter of time and obscuration qualities.<br><br>Smoke grenade launchers fire their grenades off in a pre-determined pattern.  The grenades explode a few metres above the tank, much like one of those fireworks air-burst.  The resultant dispersed smoke pellets produce a dense screen that totally cover the firing platform in a couple of seconds.  Smoke generators OTOH take much longer to produce an effective screen for the emitting tank, mainly because it is producing smoke from a single source instead of from hundreds of dispersed pellets.  Think of the smoke grenades you used to chuck around and how long it took to produce effective concealment.<br><br>Smoke grenades also typically use a phospor/rubber compound as their active ingredient and this generates a screen that works not only in the visible spectrum but also in the IR spectrum, effectively concealing the platform from thermal sights.  Diesel smoke OTOH only works in the visible spectrum.<br><br><blockquote>I have seen MBT's with about 6 or more smoke dischargers on EACh side of the tank turrets. So three is quite modest.</blockquote>I have also seen AFVs/IFVs with only 3 or 4 launcher per side.  The ACV-S, BMP-3 and CV9040 comes to mind.<br><br>What matters most is not how many launchers there are per-se but rather how the launchers, the size of their grenades and firing patterns achieves total coverage for the firing platform.<br><br>I'm sure that the SAF and STEngg have taken this into account and are satisfied with the pattern/coverage they are getting from their smoke grenade launchers.  On a side note, the AMX-13 only has 2 per side (?) but given that it  is essentially AFV/IFV sized, this is about correct ... ? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_eek.gif" alt="Shocked" title="Shocked"><br><br><blockquote>Are there heat-seeking anti-tank missiles? I think there are, and if I'm not wrong, they are fired from aircrafts. If there are indeed heat-seeking AT missiles, then would it be useful for these dischargers to fire flares to confuse such missiles - like on aircrafts?</blockquote>There are Imaging Infra Red ATGMs, the Javelin and Spike (in fire-and-forget mode) comes to mind.  They are not heat seeking per se, as in they do not home into the brightest heat source like the AAMs of old.  Instead the operator "shows" a picture of the target in the IR spectrum (for day/night operability) and the missle homes in on the IR image that matches what it was given.  As such, flares do not so much confuse as obscure the image seen by the missle.<br><br>There are also wire guided ATGMs that rely on the IR return from the missle to provide guidance.  These too have counter-measures built in to prevent bright IR sources from confusing the return from the missle to the guidance unit.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Today there is army hardware display at Temasek poly, guys go take a look. There is the Primus, Bionix, mechanised Igla and M113 ultra. Something interesting I noticed is that the Bionix display signboard quotes that the vehicle is 26 tons. WOW! The up gunned bionix is so heavy, then isnt our new light tank going to exceed the 30 tonnes restriction?</div>
