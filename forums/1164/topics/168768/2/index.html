So a lathe would be an essential tool for a builder?</div></blockquote>A lathe is certainly a desirable tool to have in any home workshop. Its usefulness extends beyond the realm of gunsmithing. Does your bathroom doorhinge still squeak even after being lubricated? No problem! Just yank the door hinge pin out, throw it on the lathe, mill its diameter down by 0.00001", and reinstall. Problem solved!   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br><br>For gunsmithing, however, model-specific jigs and fixtures are probably more important than a lathe. They are used to ensure that the proper angles on key fire-control components are not altered or milled to unsafe tolerances. Take this 1911 sear jig, for example:<br><br><a href="http://www.midwayusa.com/eproductpage.exe/showproduct?saleitemid=821000" rel="nofollow">1911 Sear Jig</a><br><br>It is used by many gunsmiths and builders to ensure that a proper sear/hammer contact angle is maintained when modifying the sear. If the correct angle is not maintained (say, by a novice builder who merely 'eyeballs' the angle when filing down the sear), there is a risk that the sear will not correctly engage the hammer hooks during live-fire, resulting in the pistol going full-auto until the magazine empties. Not fun, and certainly not safe!   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"></div>

Sure, it starts clogging up after a few dozen live rounds but a well-maintained civilian rifle should still be able to keep shooting with little danger of IA.<br><br>Unless you're with some militia training seven days in the bush in preparation for armageddon, I don't think you'd be looking at firing a 100 rounds a day. Would you?</div></blockquote>The AR's early reputation for unreliability during the Vietnam conflict was attributed mostly to the use of ammo that had too high of a calcium carbonate content in the propellant. The calcium carbonate would leave deposits in the gas system which, if not cleaned regularly, would lead to malfunctions. Unfortunately, US troops who were issued the AR back then weren't told about the importance of keeping the gas system clean.<br><br>Nowadays, the propellant used in ammo intended for the AR, both in civilian and military circles, have no calcium carbonate in them. Problems with the gas system clogging and causing malfunctions are pretty much history.<br><br>With clean powder, the AR's gas system is essentially self-cleaning and maintenance-free; I handload the cartridges for all of my ARs using either WC844 or H335 powder and have never ever experienced a gas system-related malfunction. In fact, I cannot recall ever experiencing <span style="font-style: italic;">any</span> kind of jam or malfunction during the tens of thousands of rounds I've discharged through my ARs.<br><br>As for the number of rounds fired during a typical range visit, I'd say that I go through between 100 and 150 rounds per session. That number usually goes up during 'AR Nights' at the club, when it's not uncommon to burn through 200 rounds of ammo.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"></div>
