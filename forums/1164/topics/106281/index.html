The pilot, Singaporean air force 2nd Lt. Kwang Han Loo, was killed in the crash. He was assigned to the 425th Fighter Squadron, a foreign military training squadron, at Luke Air Force Base, Ariz.<br><br>The investigation determined the crash was caused by either a G-induced loss of consciousness, spatial disorientation or a combination thereof, officials said.<br><br>During an intercept portion of the mission, the pilot began a maneuver from about 14,000 feet that resulted in the aircraft hitting the ground in a nearly vertical dive. The pilot did not attempt to eject, and the aircraft was destroyed.<br><br>(Courtesy Air Education and Training Command News Service)<br><br>.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>yeah...must have been freaky. anyway if he hit in a near vertical dive...probably he has gone through lots of neg Gs...<br><br>i know a true story of a pilot who was involved in a mid-air collision. the autopsy found that he didn't die from the collision itself but from a heart attack. doctors said he probably looked up and saw the huge body of an airliner in his windscreen and got so terrified he had a heart attack moments before impact</div>
