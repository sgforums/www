              <p>btw,</p>
              <p>just curious, what advantages does the wedgetail have in relative comparison with the g550 ?</p>
              <p>increased loiter time, greater spare parts avaliability (same engine as commercial 737s) bigger engine/thrust ?</p>
              <p>does it posesses elint attack capability ? (sorry i m a real noob when it comes to EW and AWACS)</p>
              <p>but recieve dosent necessarily mean intergreation and full operation right ? we still need some time to get the crews up to mark and fit it in with out vipers and mudhens right ?</p>

              <p>Hi,</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Our G550 is based on a commercial platform too! Based on the Gulfstream G550! :)</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>So the "platform" operating cost of the G550, smaller platform, smaller engines should be much lower then the wedgetail.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I don't think we really know how much it cost to maintain the G550's avioics vs the wedgetail's...</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I can imagine the wedgetails having longer enduration probably... not just in terms of endurance/loiter time, but also crew endurance... it is a bigger a/c and probably have more space for crew to skretch and rest... and can maybe even have spare crews to rotate.....</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I can't imagine that there will be much space in the G550 after putting in all the avionics.. it will be more spacious then a E2C probably, but still cramp.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>With more operators, can probably handle more scenarios and with greater internal room, maybe more room for upgrades later on??</p>

              <p>hmm but arent business jets more costly to operate if you compare to a 737 ? i.e, there are several hundred 737s flying all over the world, and with airasia , lionair and tiger using 737s, parts should be somewhat readily avaliable in SEA region.</p>
              <p>at least in terms of parts avaliability, gulfstream may not be exactly the most economical platform, but i do wonder, why 4 gulfstreams when we can make do with 2 of the larger wedgetails ?</p>
              <p>turnaround/downtime for maintainence ? but is there significant tradeoffs in terms of performance ?</p>

              <p>Avionics wise, I think the MESA is definitely a more advanced radar.</p>
              <p>Plane
              wise, the 737 has lower cruising speed and 1/2 the range of the G550
              (primarily because of the size and almost 2 x weight issue).Fuel wise
              the G550 carries about 6,000 US gallons compared to 6,800 US gallons of
              the 737 (which is not too far off) and can include a fuel probe.</p>
              <p>The
              G550 also operates at an higher altitude. From a radar range angle, an
              higher altitude gives a longer look-down detection range (due to impact
              of earth curvature if there is sufficient power for the radar which the
              phalcon has).</p>
              <p>A smaller aircraft also provides added safety eg
              shorter detection range by enemy jet due to lower RCS and lack of a
              dome or hump compared to the 737 makes visual id a little bit more
              difficult from range. The radar signature is similar to any other business jet which complicates id.</p>
              <p>Commercially,
              G550 costs more to operate as a business jet cos 737 carries more
              passenger = more passenger $. However, plane to plane, fuel cost will
              be lower. Spares are likely to be cheaper for the 737 as there are/will
              be over 4,000 737s. At 120+ G550s, the difference in spare costs and
              maintenance will not be significantly higher esp for a smaller jet.</p>
              <p>The
              CFM-56 on 737 is also very widely used. However, the rolls-royce engine
              (more than 500 built by 2007) is also used by many business jets
              including the Gulfstream V (191) and Bombardier global, so there'll be
              sufficient spares for those. For military, no issue of parking rights
              and cost so that's a consideration deducted.</p>
              <p>Don't forget that
              Australia is a major ally so it has access to most technologies whilst
              Singapore is not and likely will get down-graded versions. For IS-SG
              co-op, no such hang-ups as SG is able to access all Israeli tech (so
              long as its able to afford it and US tech transfer is not an issue).</p>
              <p>G550
              has shorter runway take off distance (3500 ft at full fuel load) and
              2800 ft landing which is significantly shorter than the 737-700.</p>
              <p>Cabin volume for the 737-700 is triple the G-550 but again, how much of that is excess space is another issue.</p>
              <p>Yes,
              the G550 will have elint and comint capability. One can check out all
              the juicy details on elta's website which can be accessed from
              www.iai.co.il.</p>

What I have told Chief of Air Force and CDF is that I believe that we could, if we worked through some of these significant<br>issues, look at initial operational capability at around the <span style="color: #ff0000;">end of 2011</span> and a full <span style="color: #ff0000;">operational capability around 2012</span>—assuming that there is some risk that will be realised in the not-too-distant future. That is what my<br>current planning base is. I do not want to set expectations that I cannot achieve. I have significant technical risks in the case of the MESA radar, which will really bound that problem for me.</blockquote><blockquote>The issues I am confronting relate to the fact that we are talking about<br>a highly developmental system in terms of the MESA radar. <span style="color: #ff0000;">We are a first of type </span>and we have to look at those issues and work with Boeing through those issues.</blockquote>

              <p>going by your argument, singapore's local defence industry also provides unique research and equipment uniqeuly specified to meet out local defence requirements.</p>
              <p>so all our unique stuff like the BMS for the tanks, and all the rest of the locally made stuff catered to SAF not considered  unique? therefore not considered dangerous??</p>
              <p>or does the unique configuaration integration issues don't apply to Sg? i'm sure every armed force organisation will have some teething issues when introducing new equipment, integration problems and stuff but with good R&amp;D and operational evaluations all this issues can be smoothened out in due time.</p>

              <p>man.. we need backup, i hope the T-rex gets back in here soon and asian aussie too. this lion simply cant get it in his head.</p>
              <p>and noisy lion, the tail isnt bigger FYI. the tail has a bulge at the bottom to handle the 2 arrays. not bigger tail.</p>
              <p>this is a platform discussion, not a WHY SOME PEOPLE DONT LIKE AUSTRALIA WEAPONS SYSTEM THREAD. bugger off, quit spreading your anti-australia rhetoric. i honestly dont see the link between the wedgetail and the collins sub or whatever you have just mentioned.</p>
              <p>and in any case, you ever heard of the head-start theory ? you invest in something, you develop and obtain a significant comparative advantage in it, and you exploit it for all its worth until your rivals catch up. but until then, you'd have the advantage. same reason why we are investing in the CAEW, to maintain our advantage.</p>
              <p>and is Australia the only country acquiring the MESA radar system ? seems like Turkey and Korea are also buying them. question time  : if this AESA CAEW platform is going to last us 20 years, like our e2c hawkeyes which we bought in 1987, are we throwing money into a technology/radar form that may be supersceded in terms of its potential capabilities and reach the peak of its development cycle ? in the VLR we might be the ones getting screwed for all you know.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>@weasel,</p>
              <p>just curious, i cant see how the wedgetail fits in with things like JORN. ok, JORN gives you long range detection capacity.</p>
              <p>isnt the wedgetail a duplication of this capacity ? or is it a dedicated airborne asset that gives the RAAF an added dimension to its capabilities ?</p>
              <p>what is the difference between a MESA/AESA and PESA radars ? i know Su-30 has PESA radars but thats about it.</p>
              <p>is a MESA radar the same as an AESA radar ? does it have anything to do with SAR (synthetic apeture radar?)</p>

              <p>OTH radars serve a purpose in that it has very long range detection capabilities. However, any other GCI, its suffers from earth curvature issues. In layman's terms, the radar, like a car suffers from blind spots.</p>
              <p>An airborne radar is downward looking. As such, it suffers from less blind spots. However, the amount of power output one can put on an aircraft is still a limiting factor. Aircraft are also limited by fuel consideration and thus cannot stay in the air forever whilst a ground radar can operate 24/7.</p>
              <p>Hence whilst SG has Awacs, it still relies on ground radar like the FPS-117. Both have advantages and disadvantages. Ground radar is also a lot less mobile. In large battlespace, battles can (and normally will as far as possible) take place in ground radar blind spots. AEW can follow the battle more consistently but again can be shot down.</p>
              <p>On the issue of radar difference, it's 101. I would suggest Carlo Kopp's write up.</p>
              <p>http://www.ausairpower.net/aesa-intro.html</p>
              <p>Whilst his conclusions are generally suspect, his facts are likely correct. In layman's term, the difference between PESA and AESA are the T/R modules. Both use electronic beam steering but AESA has multiple transmitters and receivers that can generate and receive multiple beams on specific frequencies. A PESA probably has a single source feeding the frequencies which if fails, effectively means the radar can't work. That's accounts for the "active" vs "passive" element. For MESA, that's just a fancy name for an AESA that is integrated with other functions eg IFF id etc. Just like networking.</p>
              <p>Having said that, the PESA is still a better radar than mechanically scanned ones as the above article indicates.</p>

              <p>interesting read.</p>
              <p>thank you.</p>
              <p>now i understand why our F15s need better airconditioning / cooling systems.</p>
              <p>i understand, so the wedgetail fulfills a different purpose in the RAAF inventory ? while the JORN is meant to give australia more strategic depth in terms of time to detect and react to the enemy, the wedgetail provides C&amp;C and covers immediate battlespace gaps ?</p>

              <p>man.. we need backup, i hope the T-rex gets back in here soon
              and asian aussie too. this lion simply cant get it in his head.</p>
              <p>and noisy lion, the tail isnt bigger FYI. the tail has a bulge
              at the bottom to handle the 2 arrays. not bigger tail.</p>
              <p>this is a platform discussion, not a WHY SOME PEOPLE DONT LIKE
              AUSTRALIA WEAPONS SYSTEM THREAD. bugger off, quit spreading your
              anti-australia rhetoric. i honestly dont see the link between the
              wedgetail and the collins sub or whatever you have just
              mentioned.</p>
              <p>and in any case, you ever heard of the head-start theory ? you
              invest in something, you develop and obtain a significant
              comparative advantage in it, and you exploit it for all its worth
              until your rivals catch up. but until then, you'd have the
              advantage. same reason why we are investing in the CAEW, to
              maintain our advantage.</p>
              <p>and is Australia the only country acquiring the MESA radar
              system ? seems like Turkey and Korea are also buying them. question
              time <span style="color: #ff0000;"> : if this AESA CAEW platform is going to last us 20
              years, like our e2c hawkeyes which we bought in 1987, are we
              throwing money into a technology/radar form that may be supersceded
              in terms of its potential capabilities and reach the peak of its
              development cycle ? in the VLR we might be the ones getting screwed
              for all you know.</span></p>
              <p>@weasel,</p>
              <p>just curious, i cant see how the wedgetail fits in with things
              like JORN. ok, JORN gives you long range detection capacity.</p>
              <p>isnt the wedgetail a duplication of this capacity ? or is it a
              dedicated airborne asset that gives the RAAF an added dimension to
              its capabilities ?</p>
              <p>what is the difference between a MESA/AESA and PESA radars ? i
              know Su-30 has PESA radars but thats about it.</p>
              <p>is a MESA radar the same as an AESA radar ? does it have
              anything to do with SAR (synthetic apeture radar?)</p>

              <p>Further delay of the completion of any project make the technlogy</p>
              <p>in specified contract outdated,if it  is finally completed.</p>
              <p>The good example is Collins SSK.</p>
              <p>When the A$5 billion contract was signed in <span style="color: #ff0000;">1987,</span></p>
              <p>computer CPU may be 286 or 386 model.</p>
              <p>When the 6  platforms were  commissioned from <span style="color: #ff0000;">1996</span></p>
              <p>to 2003,what were the progress in computers CPU??</p>
              <p>Bear in mind the spec of the contract may be drawn one or 2 years</p>
              <p>before the contract was signed!!</p>
              <p>My view is u can never catch up with technology.</p>
              <p>But u have to make sure the time span between</p>
              <p>the draft of spec and the final successful completion of contract</p>
              <p>and running of the platform as short as possible!!</p>
              <p>The platform  MUST WORK according to spec!!NO LESS!!</p>
              <p>Again,Wedgetail will take at least 10 years from contract before</p>
              <p>it can fly and run properly,according to spec!!</p>
