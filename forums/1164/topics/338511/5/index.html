              <strong>Defence has for the first time publicly spoken of the possibility of cancelling the RAAF's Project Wedgetail</strong>.
              <p>The
              possibility was revealed by the DMO's General Manager, Programs Warren
              King, at last week's hearing of the Senate Defence and Foreign Affairs
              committee.</p>
              <p>He said: "If it has no future there is no point going forward with it.</p>
              <p>"Bluntly speaking - is there a future or not for this technology?</p>
              <p>"The extreme of that is to recommend to cancel the program."</p>
              <p>The
              cancellation of the project, which is the linchpin of the country' s
              NCW military strategy, would lead to enormous problems for the
              country's defence planners.</p>
              <p>A decision is expected in the June to September period.</p>
              <p>Problems include persistent clutter in the radar and integration of the systems.</p>
              <p>Testing of the system in the north of Australia at the moment is ‘encouraging', according to a source close to the program.</p>
              <p>Details of the MIT Lincoln Lab report are also on the horizon.</p>
              <p>Whether they will be released publicly for the punters remains to be seen.</p>
              <p>Fingers crossed.</p>

              <blockquote>
              <p><span class="talkername">CHAIR</span> —When did that happen?</p>
              <p><span class="talkername">Mr King</span> —I think it was implemented in November or December last year. I will
              have to check the date. It was either very late last year or very early
              this year. Boeing reported to us that that has reinvigorated them
              because it has given them a path forward; it has given them a few to
              the horizon about how they can complete this program. There were a
              number of undertakings on both sides in that step aside. One of them is
              that Boeing bring the aircraft to Australia for what we are calling an
              operational utility demonstration.</p>
              <p>One of the questions in our minds was that the aircraft was being
              tested in the United States, in United States environmental conditions
              and in United States climate condition. In order to understand its
              operational utility as opposed to the technical specification that you
              can measure, it is coming to Australia either later this month or early
              next month for a period of testing and for operational evaluations in
              an Air Force exercise. So it will be here for I think nearly two weeks.
              If you like I will get you the details.</p>
              <p>The purpose of that is to get a sense of that operational utility of
              the Wedgetail system. We are also doing a number of other formal tests
              and trials. There is an ongoing and accelerated program in the United
              States and we have inducted other aircraft into that program. The
              intention of the deed was that in June we would take into consideration
              the Lincoln Laboratory reports, the operational utility demonstration,
              and the test trials program, the formal test and trials program in the
              United States to make a determination on the way forward for the
              project.</p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">Bluntly speaking, is there a future? My concern is whether there is
              a future for this technology. The extreme of that is that we recommend
              cancelling the program.</span> The other side of that program is that it has
              deficiencies. We understand those deficiencies but there is a path to
              move forward that will involve settlements and a number of other
              issues. There is a viable and competent capability that has a long-term
              future and that is of value to the Australian Defence Force.</p>
              <p>My view of that is that even that program is challenged. People are
              reporting what you would call stability, that is, that the systems that
              are working together are failing; they are not working in a stable way
              for long periods. Normally, if you go back to things like the Collins
              experience, those things tend to correct with time. You keep reworking
              your software until you get that out. Normally it is a correctable
              situation. It seems to me that although we are all working towards this
              end of June date to make this decision, we may not have enough data at
              that point.</p>
              <p>We are certainly encouraging Boeing, and I know that Boeing are
              working with their staff at Northrop Grumman to meet that date, but it
              seems to me that it may well be July, August or September before we
              have enough information to make that decision. That is my immediate
              response to you. I would be happy to take any more specific questions
              on it.</p>

              <p>Well if you see some of lionnoisy's brainwaves and big ideas you'll get a rough idea of what reality means to him. Basically he's a bad-news-filter when it comes to Australia, and a good-news-filter when it comes to Singapore.</p>
              <p>Which is half bad if he wasn't so illogical about it, even if something happens the way he does not like it, he'll cling to his own point of view, stick his fingers into his ears, and sing "la la la I cannot hear you" for as long as he can. You can present all the evidence you want to him, but of course, one can bring a horse to water, but you can't make the horse drink.</p>
              <p>So nowadays Idon't even bother to read his post, just carpet bomb them like the B1B Lancer dropping JADAMs on transformers in the movie.</p>
              <p>Anyway here are some of his half-baked ideas:</p>
              <ol>
              <li>An air-defence umbrella of 50km radius is good enough for Singapore (in reality the air-defence umbrella of Singapore in reality, is a lot larger)</li>
              <li>Have using a ratio of 1 ship every 1 square kilometer of ocean to ensure security. Which is nonsense, given that he often uses this against Australia, this means he expects Australia to equip, fuel and maintain THOUSANDS of warships along it's coastline, a feat even the US Navy, or any Navy for the matter cannot maintain.</li>
              <li>Using the "mini cv", in other words, the new Landing Helicopter Dock, the Australians bought... to launch their F-18s.</li>
              <li>Using a 250,000 dollar FANTAIL UAV as an impromptu mission to "carsh" into targets... or as a delivery platform for ONE submunition.</li>
              <li>Equipping our troops with rollerblades to "save fuel" so that we don't have to trooplift them to their destinations.</li>
              <li>Holding the SAR-21 by the scope handle to run during combat fire and movement. He cooked this up as a point to keep harping on when he realized that the TAR-21 had a lot of advantages over the SAR-21... except it has no scope handle... in fact looking at his posts you'd think for lionnoisy the most important thing about any rifle is that it must have a scope handle so you can hold it like a shopping bag while "running for your life".</li>
              </ol>
              <p> </p>
              <p>And there's far more...</p>
              <p>By the way lionnoisy actually has NO military experience at all to speak of, besides simply messing around with the AR-15 who knows where. When asked about his military experience in NS, he has always been quiet... but unfortunately for him I found an old post, one of the first he made where he declares that he does not really know much about anything military in terms of practical experience.</p>
              <p>Which is not surprising, given the way he writes about stuff generally indicates he has absolutely no practical experience whatsoever, as well as such a detachment from reality that he learns nothing from what he reads and his repeated pwning here.</p>
