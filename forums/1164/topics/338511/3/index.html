              <p>RSAF. RAAF never had AEWs or E2Cs previously.</p>
              <p>Just stating that the G550 CAEW will double the number of control stations of the E-2C. If RSAF could manage with just 1 E-2C and 3 stations in the air previously, then the G-550 doubles that capacity ie 6 stations can mean crew taking turns if only 3 needed.</p>
              <p>RAAF has a lot more ground to cover but I doubt if the wedgetail radar coverage exceeds the G550. Altitude plays a significant part in radar range limits and the G550 can operate at much higher altitudes.</p>
              <p>Also, wedgetail endurance is not more than the G550. If RAAF needed endurance, they should have gotten the B767 version or the larger B747 but cost outweighed endurance as a factor, hence the choice of the 737 platform.</p>
              <p>Australian local radar coverage is also supplemented by ground stations.</p>
              <p>The best part for RSAF is that if the E2C can be put into reserve and maintained in serviceable condition. RSAF actually has more AEW platforms than RAAF that can be used in wartime!</p>
              <p>Regionally, RSAF and RAAF have overlapping interests and both are more likely to operate together than apart. Together they project very strong capabilities and should be seen as complementary rather than competing. Outside the region, RAAF has never participated without US/UK participation so their need is again complemented by others.</p>

              <p>Thats not really true.  There was quite a bit of fuss kicked up by private jet owners who were petitioning to CAA to clear private jets to enter FL250 (or was it 280) and above citing fuel economy issues. </p>
              <p>They were burning more fuel than anyone else becaue they weren't allowed to enter the higher altitude blocks where the bigger aircraft were allowed to cruise. The fuel consumption rate decrease between FL250 and FL300 is not marginal, hence the debate. The debate was slightly leaning to the operators of small jets at that point simply cause there seemed to be a lot of them popping up.  Not sure if that will be the case given the current economic situation.</p>

              <p>hmm, i wonder why saab 9-5 parts are more expensive than a mitsubishi lancer or toyota altis part/corolla.</p>
              <p>and i wonder why 737 is being used in the P8I, P8 poseidon and the wedgetails.</p>
              <p>i wonder why so many budget airlines using 737 ? i wonder why so many airlines operate 737 if its uneconomical.</p>
              <p>even though there are various models of the 737 series, there are definitely part commonalities throughout the entire fleet. the exact percentage, i cant tell you, the synergies to be exploited, are plain to see.</p>
              <p>i simplified the concept of economies of scales to explain it to you. but there is a firm reason why the trend in military technologies are going for COTS and adapting commercial components and declining employment of exclusive military only platforms.</p>
              <p>think of reasons why platforms like the nimrod are slated for future replacement and why commercial jets like the A330 and the 767 and 777 have been offered for the next generation tanker. Japan is the only oddity with its production of the kawasaki P-2 (correct me if i get this wrong) but they have special reasons for maintaining and supporting such an exclusive platform.</p>
              <p>but sometimes, i wonder, is the issue really pertaining to a lack of evidence ? or is it more of a matter of individual perspective ? or is it something personal?</p>
              <p>dont get me wrong, i <strong>have never said the 737 wedgetail will be cheaper than the gulfstream to run. </strong>On a platform to platform comparison basis, the 737 as a platform offers FAR greater benefits and potential than the gulfstream.</p>
              <p>immediate operational costs not equals to economies of scale and runtime costs. sometimes you must look into what platform offers the best performance. why does the US M1 abrams tank use JP-8 when it can use diesel ?</p>
              <p>lets look at it 20 years over a long run period/expected service life. will the 737 offer greater value and options in terms of parts, engines and potential upgrades ? will the cost to operate the 737 increase over the years as it becomes an increasingly outdated platform ? or will the g550, with a smaller fleet cost more ?</p>
              <p>go figure. i can only convince you so far. the final decision rests in your mind anyway.</p>

              <p>well you could be cynical about it or you can choose what you want to believe.</p>
              <p>1) defence news plainly stated the number of buyers and who bought what. dont think you can read too much into that</p>
              <p>2) regarding the doubts over the observers, i think that is a good point save for the fact that defence news also criticized boeing in a subsequent link. its lobby groups and the need for US congressional approval to transfer technology as a clear kind of unfair commercial pressure/tactic that boeing is employing.</p>
              <p>somewhat brazenly if i might add.</p>
              <p>should be pretty safe to eliminate an element of bias and accord the article a certain degree of journalistic balance.</p>
              <p>3) why did the USAF use big awacs like the E-3 that uses the 707 as a baseline aircraft to carry the radar and equipment ?</p>
              <p>why did Japan choose the 767 for its E-3 sentries ? could have chosen a smaller aircraft but chose to go with the 767.</p>
              <p>all interesting questions to why compress the equipment and manpower needed into such a small airframe. such as the G550.</p>
              <p>granted, the E-2C is a small aircraft, but it functioned in a lesser capacity, covering lesser radius and performing fewer functions compared to a full sized awacs.</p>
              <p>its clear anecdotal evidence that larger aircraft are usually preferred for AWACs role.</p>
              <p>should be pretty interesting to see what choice will the US and nato make when the E-3 sentries come up for replacement sometime in 2020. likely that the wedgetail would be in prime position for that as it would be a proven platform by then.</p>

              <p>The 737 engines will use more fuel than the BR710s simply because of
              its higher thrust (bigger engine, more fuel needed). Also, more people
              = more staff cost. That will be the bulk of costs.</p>
              <p>The G550 is not a saab more like a picanto. Smaller engine,
              smaller vehicle compared to the B737. The saab has a more powerful
              engine compared to the altis.</p>
              <p>Replacing a kia picanto engine
              will always be cheaper than an altis, even though there are fewer
              picantos. Same thing between CFM-56 (higher thrust) and BR-710 (lower
              thrust). Parts for a smaller vehicle will normally be cheaper than
              parts for a larger one. Higher cc engine normally use more fuel.</p>
              <p>G550 = 6038 gal fuel load for 6750nm. B737-700ER 6875 gal fuel load for 5375nm.</p>
              <p>http://www.roadandtrack.com/article.asp?section_id=34&amp;article_id=5421</p>
              <p>Also, bigger plane= more parts to maintain.</p>
              <p>Gulfstream actually operates Gulfsave which provides parts at cost-effective prices.</p>
              <p>http://www.gulfstream.com/news/releases/2003/102803.html</p>
              <p>Unless
              business jets disappear altogether which won't happen, the G550
              shouldn't cost more than the B737 to maintain in both initial and
              life-time cost.</p>
              <p>Even the USAF operates BR-710 engines with their C-37As.</p>
              <p>RR
              is a brilliant manufacturer of engines (typical german efficiency) and
              the BR710 is probably the quietest and most reliable in its class.Overall, its another coup for DSTA in cost management.</p>

              <p>granted, the E-2C is a small aircraft, but it functioned in a lesser capacity, covering lesser radius and performing fewer functions compared to a full sized awacs.</p>

              <p>Seriously, these large AEW &amp; C and AWACs planes were concieved in an entirely different time period. Were miniturization techniques good enough or should I say cool enough to put these manual rotating radar domes on planes the size of the Streams? Hardly a viable comparison would you not think? Current anecdotal evidence seem to point the way of smaller frames as well; Gulf-streams, Erieye, Bombadiers for the Astor, etc. What does that say about smaller frames ? Even South Korea had originally wanted the Gulf-streams.</p>

              <p>Ricketts’ report quotes Air Vice Marshall Chris Deeble as being
              unconvinced the system will work as advertised by late 2012, which in
              itself is yet another 18 months later than Boeing previously promised,
              after a string of broken deadlines.</p>
              <div class="advert"></div>
              <p>Deeble
              is quoted as saying Australia has called in the <span style="color: #ff0000;">MIT Lincoln Laboratory</span> in the US to "help Australia understand the baseline performance of the
              system and to indicate any path forward for remediation of any
              shortfalls."</p>
              <p>What! We now need help to understand what we bought!
              A Boeing spokesman flatly denied that it was going to cancel the
              project, but this is the company that promised Qantas it would have
              Dreamliners flying by now, and then by late next year, and now claims
              it doesn’t know when they will fly, or even how far. And it got off the
              hook with a trifling $291 million in liquidated damages to Qantas.</p>
              <p>What
              does the over promising and under delivering of the Wedgetail and the
              Dreamliner say about the promises accepted by Brendan Nelson when he
              impulsively ordered $6 billion worth of F/A -18F Super Hornets to make
              up the defence gap caused by the delays to the Lockheed Martin lead JSF
              project?</p>
              <p>Or of new defence minister Joel Fitzgibbon in confirming
              the order for a second rate jet that some critics claim will be as
              useful against Indonesia’s Russian built jets as the Polish Cavalry was
              in dealing with Hitler’s Panzer tanks.</p>
              <p>Fitzgibbon has already
              written off $1 billion of taxpayer funds in the ludicrously inept
              Seasprite helicopter project. It would be chicken feed beside the
              consequences of a failure of the Wedgetail program.</p>
              <p>In 2008, three years after it was due, we need help to understand the manifestly untrue line we were sold year ago. WTF.</p>

              <p>dude, im impressed with your knowledge about aircraft.</p>
              <p>i stand corrected about engine and airframe.</p>
              <p>but even then, be it more of a picanto or a 9-5. surely there are plenty of Commercial synergies to be had with the 737 platform.</p>
              <p>i.e can expect continued development, easy access to MRO operators, plenty of MRO facilities, plenty of trained pilots/ use of reserve pilots.</p>
              <p>all these do help in cost savings for a particular aircraft right ?</p>
              <p>furthermore, with a large family of existing aircraft, potential future development, is definitely going to be very important. look at the botched up KC135 replacement tanker programe. look at the projected service life for the E-3 and the joint stars after the blcok 20/25 SLEP. </p>
              <p>the potential service life for such a platform may be far greater than the 20 years our E-2C lasted us. would the 737 last longer or the gulfstream ? Im not as familiar as you in aviation matters  but i think the 737 buy by aus/korea is looking at a very long term projection.</p>

              <p>i personally think that there is alot of potential in the MESA system but im not against the g550 CAEW in any case. im neutral on this one. read the thread further back ? i was initially for the wedgetail, but the more i read up (ironically thanks to lionnoisy) the more i realized, the CAEW dosent seem too bad.</p>
              <p>just wanted to inject some of the links ive read that seems to indicate that the MESA radar is superior to the phalcon.</p>
              <p>in any case, if we had ordered the wedgetails like australia, we could be sitting on a hefty "rebate" in terms of contractual penalties. i dont have any sources to prove it but i recall boeing declaring a 770 million dollar penalty on their balance sheet related to wedgetail development.</p>
              <p>comparing this with the korean 1.5 billion USD deal for 4 awacs, the aussies could be getting something like nearly 50% discount on the AWACS. silver lining  in a dark cloud ? i dont know.</p>

              <p>point 3 is also somewhat negated by point 2's factor isnt it ? besides, no operational doctrine calls for an awacs to be operating over hostile SAM territory. its usually safely behind the CAP/enemy bird zone. if an AWAC did that, its asking to be shot down. why send such a valuable target in harm's way ?</p>
              <p>point 8) may also be highly contested. if uncle sam decides to make the wedgetail its future AWACS platform. which platform will be in greater global use once NATO , england , Japan and france decide to buy it ? turkey has already bought it.</p>
              <p>but this is a potential moot point. 5th generation fighters and their Onboard AESA radars may even eliminate the need for a future potential awacs to provide sit awareness and increased LR detection. future AWACS may be more like airborne traffic controllers and data hubs to coordinate downstream and upstream data flows.</p>
              <p>if UCAVs appear somewhere in the next 30 years, the awacs might become some kind of data motherlode. (but thats a little farfetched and lets not go into that)</p>
              <p>like ive mentioned before, the 737 has the space to mount more consoles and additional equipment. utilizing the awacs as a multi-purpose utility aircraft like fuel-tanker, SIGINT, ELINT <strong>concurrently</strong>. this is a technical possibility. unlike the G550 with a limited payload.</p>
              <p>like shotgun mentioned. it has the potential to do this with<strong> increased capacity</strong>, meaning it might be possible for an aircraft to have crew rest facilities and improve operating conditions/crew conditions. G550 seems a little cramped to me.</p>
              <p>whereas the G550 can possibly do these things, it comes at compromises like modular packages and necessity to strip the aircraft and prepare it before its next mission (speculation on my part)</p>
              <p>point being, i think technically, the wedgetail and its MESA radar is probably more geared to the future than the Phalcon. but the phalcon's ability to fly high and out of SAM envelopes is pretty useful.</p>

              <p>So point 2 is very valid.

              <p>so on one hand you are postulating that 737 cannot be considered for the forseeable future with no upgrades and on the other hand you are saying RSAF procurement is always planned out with the future ?</p>
              <p>the phalcon radar technology has been sold on a larger 707 (kc135 was based on this civillian jetliner) aircraft</p>
              <p>http://www.israeli-weapons.com/weapons/aircraft/phalcon/Phalcon.html</p>
              <p>i cant find the link but i was reading up about how the US and congressional action actually forced Israel to halt of pause phalcon radar development after the Israel-china fiasco where the israelis tried to sell the chinese 4 phalcon radar equipped il-76.</p>
              <p>bottom-line is that technological transfers have proven difficult subsequently after the china debacle. i wont be so sure of planned future pipeline developments for the phalcon radar.</p>
              <p>really ? i think the wedgetail radar offers far more service life potential. just look at the E-3 sentries. still soldiering on after something like 35 years and expected to carry on in service well into 2020, which, by then make the wedgetail right for entry into american service.</p>
              <p>cant see how RSAF would not have seen the future potential of the wedgetail. its more likely a case of <em>bo he hae mah ho</em>. no wedgetail offered to us, then CAEW lor.</p>
              <p>besides, wedgetail has only been offered to select US allies. not every country gets it.</p>

              <p>really, im surprised you arent aware of this. the F22 uses its AESA radar to exchange data. </p>
              <blockquote>The F-22 has several unique functions for an aircraft of its size and
              role. For instance, it has threat detection and identification
              capability along the lines of that available on the <a title="Boeing RC-135" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boeing_RC-135#RC-135V.2FW_Rivet_Joint">RC-135 Rivet Joint</a>.<sup id="cite_ref-avweek_20070107_ul_40-2" class="reference"><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/F-22_Raptor#cite_note-avweek_20070107_ul-40"><span>[</span>41<span>]</span></a></sup> While the F-22's equipment isn't as powerful or sophisticated, because
              of its stealth, it can be typically hundreds of miles closer to the
              battlefield, which often compensates for the reduced capability.<sup id="cite_ref-avweek_20070107_ul_40-3" class="reference"><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/F-22_Raptor#cite_note-avweek_20070107_ul-40"><span>[</span>41<span>]</span></a></sup>

Though reduced in capability compared to dedicated airframes such as the <a title="E-3 Sentry" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/E-3_Sentry">E-3 Sentry</a>, as with its threat identification capability, the F-22's forward presence is often of benefit.<sup id="cite_ref-avweek_20070107_tb_37-4" class="reference"><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/F-22_Raptor#cite_note-avweek_20070107_tb-37"><span>[</span>38<span>]</span></a></sup> The system allows the F-22 to designate targets for cooperating F-15s
              and F-16s, and even determine if two friendly aircraft are targeting
              the same enemy aircraft, thus enabling one of them to choose a

              crew rotates shifts. </p>
              <p>On the other hand, from open sources, the G550 Phalcon seems to
              pack in an array of COMINT, and ELINT equipment as well,
              integrating multiple sensors with the radar into the overall
              picture.   The Wedgetail seems to be a rather dedicated
              AEW&amp;C aircraft.  </p>

              <p>i dont know if anyone has ever speculated this before, but any chance you think that the G550s are actually for elint/comint/sigint or maybe dedicated SEMA platforms while the E2Cs will perform as dedicated AWACS  as an interim solution till the F35?</p>
              <p>with NCW and huge expected data flows, our G550s may become flying exchange servers, linking our flyboys to our formidables , to the tankies , the grunts and the arty boyz while the E2Cs serve as genuine airborne controllers. the black raven is pretty old anyway isnt it ? last airframe built of its kind.</p>
              <p>afterall, our F15 strike eagles and their AESA radars might have some capability to function as a mini awacs. we using them with WSOs anyway right ? not inconcievable that the F15 wso detects inbound bandits, uses link 16 to talk to other F15s and F16s in the air force and vector them in to launch AMRAAMs.</p>
              <p>i'd be the first on the line to admit i know very little about AWACs. but i dont think we should place blind faith in a single platform and accept whatever we got/acquired. plenty of questions out there that remain to be asked and answered.</p>

              <p>Well, you know, AWACs have multiple uses, and the AEW&amp;C tag arose from the fact that you could mount electronic warfare equipment and command and control equipment on AWACs now. The Russian A-50 is said to be capable of remote controlling MiG-31s and launching and directing missiles, and a few other possible things like Multistatic radar etc. for detecting stealth.</p>
              <p><br>I think the bottom line is whether the doctrine available knows how to make full use of the AWACs because surveillance is only one of the many roles they can do. If I am not wrong, the Phalcon was also meant to function in a similar role as the US JSTARS.</p>

            <div class='col-md body'><p>Not same role as JSTAR. Different radar needed (ground radar). SAR with GMTI. JSTAR is outdated with the rise of UAVs which duplicate the capability (though not as powerful). SAR images are a lot more fine than air search radar and distinguish ground clutter a lot better.</p></div>
