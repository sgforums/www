            <div class='col-md body'>There were reports of the drum falling off in the initial models. I don't know if they fixed the problem later on.<br><br>I have only ever fired the SAW with live ammo on 2 occassions and these were with the 30-round mag.<br><br>I think it is a real bummer not to issue the 100-round drum for training use. It would be very useful just for the SAW gunners to get used to walking around the bush with the drum.<br><br>So the fact that the drums are not issued could mean that they are prone to some kinds of breakages. Or maybe the drums don't work well with our cheapo plastic blanks.<br><br>The Indonesians, Philippines and even the Croatian and some other Eastern European countries have armed some of their troops with Ultimax 100.<br><br>During the conflict in Yugoslavia I saw in TIME magazine a picture of a Croat guardsman using a U100 with the drum.</div>

Changing mags must be hell especially when prone with bipod. Not much of a "support weapon" if you ask me.</div>
