              <p class="postByline">Posted by <a title="Posts by Bradley Peniston" href="http://defensenews.com/blogs/eurosatory/author/bradp/"><strong><span style="color: #336699;">Bradley Peniston</span></strong></a> | <span class="date">June 15th, 2010</span> | <a title="View all posts in Combat Vehicles" rel="category tag" href="http://defensenews.com/blogs/eurosatory/category/combat-vehicles/"><strong><span style="color: #336699;">Combat Vehicles</span></strong></a></p>
              <div class="entry">
              <p>By <a href="achuter@defensenews.com?subject=%22From%20DN's%20Show%20Scout%22%20target=%22_blank%22%20&gt;"><strong><span style="color: #336699;">ANDREW CHUTER</span></strong></a> – Singapore’s ST Kinetics, headquartered just below the Equator, is targeting countries on the Arctic Circle for its Bronco all-terrain tracked vehicle. Potential markets include Sweden, the home of rival BvS10 built by BAE Systems.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <div id="attachment_371" class="wp-caption alignleft" style="width: 310px;"><img class="size-medium wp-image-371" src="http://defensenews.com/blogs/eurosatory/files/2010/06/120408_bronco_315-300x211.jpg" alt="Bronco All Terrain Tracked Carrier (ST Engineering photo)" width="300" height="211">
              <p class="wp-caption-text">Bronco All Terrain Tracked Carrier (ST Engineering photo)</p>
              </div>
              ST Kinetics chief marketing officer Patrick Choy said Swedish officials have already spoken to his company about the capabilities of their machine.
              <p> </p>
              <p>The Singaporean executive said that while the Swedes were only looking at what was on the market, ST Kinetics were open to bidding, subject to the requirement.</p>
              <p>The Bronco may have been built in the tropical heat of Singapore but Choy reckons the vehicle’s all-terrain capabilities would be well-suited for countries such as Canada, Denmark, Finland, Norway and Sweden, which will increasingly need to police the Arctic region as the ice cap melts.</p>
              <p>ST Kinetics emphasized its links with the Nordic region at Eurosatory, announcing a sale of 40mm ammunition to the Finnish Army for automatic grenade launchers. This is a repeat order from the Finns, who have been customers since 2000.</p>
              <p>Requirements in the Arctic rim for an all-terrain armored vehicle would pitch the Bronco into a head-to-head fight with the smaller-payload BvS10.</p>
              <p>Upgraded versions of the vehicles have already clashed in the U.K. and France over the last couple of years. ST Kinetics won with the Warthog in Britain, but lost to the Viking II in France.</p>
              <p>The Singaporeans’ suffered a series of problems with the Warthog after it vehicle arrived in the U.K. for testing. The armor had to be increased, requiring changes to the suspension and driveline to compensate for the weight.</p>
              <p>Choy said eight or nine hulls have been blown up to test the revised protection requirements. The protection tests have now been completed and final reliability testing is now being undertaken ahead of expected deployment to Afghanistan later this year.</p>
              <p>Choy said the upgrade has taken a lot of pain, effort and money to achieve but the work was essential to reciprocate the trust the British had put in ST Kinetics by giving them the order in the first place.</p>
              <p>ST Kinetics used Eurosatory to promote a new heavily armed version of the all-terain machine known as the Bronco Fire Support Vehicle.</p>
              <p>The concept vehicle was fitted with a remote-control weapon station on the front cabin sporting a 40mm grenade launcher and 7.62mm coaxial machine gun, while the rear cabin is armed with the company’s 50 RCWS mounting the .50-cal. CIS 50 gun.</p>
              <p>Choy said the company did engineering studies to prove the concept, and is now looking to gauge global interest in a machine that can provide considerable fire support virtually anywhere on the battlefield.</p>
              <p>He said one idea was decoupling the rear cabin to use it as a fire support platform with its own electrical power.</p>

              <p>In addition, it incorporates of two Remote Control Weapon Stations 
              (RCWS) on board to provide superior fire support to warfighters, making 
              the Bronco FSV the most lethal all terrain vehicle in its class.</p>
              <p>The front cabin of the Bronco FSV is fitted with the ST Kinetics 
              40/7.62 RCWS, while the rear cabin is armed with the ST Kinetics 50 
              RCWS.  The 40/7.62 RCWS is the world's first dual-weapon RCWS to be 
              mounted with the highly reliable CIS 40AGL and the 7.62mm coaxial MG, 
              and is able to fire ST Kinetics' 40mm Air-Bursting ammunition.</p>
              <p>The 50 
              RCWS is mounted with the versatile CIS 50MG, which has an unique double 
              belt-feed system for fast and easy switching of ammunition from standard
               ball rounds to Armour-Piercing Incendiary rounds or Saboted Light 
              Armour Penetrator rounds for different levels of fire support.</p>
              <p>Both the 40/7.62 RCWS and 50 RCWS are equipped with an advanced 
              sighting and fire control system that enables the gunner to maintain 
              line-of-sight with the target during day and night operations.  Coupled 
              with a video tracking feature, the gunner is able to achieve a high hit 
              probability even for moving targets.</p>
