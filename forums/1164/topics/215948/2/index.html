The incendiary effect can neutralise bunkers or "garrissoned" infantry.  Even if they have some form of cover, the 25mm HE would probably have pinned them down.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>1.  In Iraq, on the front lines, the US Army uses latest variants of Bradleys with ERA. These variants weigh 30 or more tons and are heavily protected and probably can take a frontal hit from a RPG ( but not the latest versions ).<br>A HEAT round can penetrate  ( in theory ) RHA up to 8 times its warhead diameter. Take a 84 mm Carl Gustaf round and penetration is 670 mm of RHA . How thick is the Bionix armor ?<br><br>2.  With sights of  8 to 10  times magnification,  I believe you can see quite a  lot from 600 m or more. Also, max effective range of 25 mm cannon is 1,600 to 2,500 m. So, 600 m is rather short range for a Bushmaster ; 100 m is point blank.  Operationally and tactically,  Bradleys  do not usually operate at these short ranges.<br><br>3.  For tough opposition in urban terrain, Israelis go in with Achzarits Nagmashots, Nagmashons, PUMAs and Nakpadons and accompanied by Merkava IIIs and IVs no less.</div>

It is definitely harder to hit something moving fast and manuverability compared to being just heavily armoured. As no matter how thick armour is, it can still be defeated, But speed wise, its all depending on the operator skill.Nonetheless...its time for a change of platform of the new SM1.</div>

The missile can also be launched immediately without tracking when unexpected target appears.

Top attack mode to engage tanks n armoured vehicles in order to strike least armoured area on vehicle's roof. Missile flies at about 1m above the line of sight. Missile's sensor initiates warhead above roof of target. Direct attack (DA) mode to engage light vehicles, buildings n bunkers.<br><br>[/b]</blockquote>Seeing the pics of the new British LAW, I was thinking if it is possible if ST can design a tandem version of the MATADOR. Since we are alreasy learning from the Ukraine in terms of guided rocket technology, and that we did get inolved in the SPIKE projects, I believe we can make a short range missile some wad like the British.<br><br>U see, the northern chappies seem to have a sudden rush and fascination for MBT. They already got 48 PT-91 and one of their generals expressed desires of getting a tank division. Even if they are buying at a slow pace, their dream might materialise. Thus it is better for Singapore to start a credible program to arm the battalions with better anti-tank capabilities.<br><br>We can also harness smart technologies like thos 120mm,155mm rounds from mortar or artillery that can attack the MBT top down.</div>
