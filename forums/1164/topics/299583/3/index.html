Triumf successfully fights air targets, manufactured with the use of "stealth" technology at all altitudes of their combat operation and at maximum distances. When creating this system, Russian specialists used latest technologies in the radar industry, microelement base and computer engineering. In the opinion of general designer Vladimir Svetlov, Triumf is the world's first system which can selectively work with the use of several types of missiles. "<strong>The long-range missile has no analogues.

The missile is small-- considerably lighter than the ZUR 48N6Ye used in the S-300PMU1 systems and the Favorit. The missile is equipped with an active homing head and has an estimated single shot kill probability of 0.9 for manned aircraft and 0.8 for unmanned maneuvering aircraft. a gas-dynamic control system enables the 9M96 missile to maneuver at altitudes of up to 35 km at forces of over 20g, which permits engagment of non- strategic ballistic missiles. A mockup of the missile was set up at an Athens arms exhibition in October 1998. One 9M96 modification will become the basic long-range weapon of Air Force combat aircraft, and may become the standardized missile for air defense SAM systems, ship-launched air defense missile systems, and fighter aircraft.<br></blockquote></div>

You can desperately search all over the web to find something suiting your argument but just ignore the plain/ basic factor that almost every army deploys low tier /close in air defense systems that counter the threat from the low flying targets may suddenly pop up from the horizon.

            <div class='col-md body'>At least Proton has realized that thereÂ’s a physical barrier that limits the S-400Â’s radar canÂ’t detect whatever targets at itÂ’s maximum range, yet a slowmo like you only till now wants me to repeat whatever I have explained in my previous posts? If a no brainer likes you want to give it a try AGAIN: IÂ’ll repeat here again: How your S-300/400 engagement radar, as advertised in hundreds kms range, detects a low flying Tomahawk, just   several meters above the ground, over the horizon, maybe 20kms away?<br><br></div>

That works out 1260 sq kms in total!<br><br>You seem to believe whatever junks that appears online without using your own mind to judge, S400 is intended to feature as many types as possible missiles. But only the S400 evolved from S300PM-3 is actually deployed, an S-300 is only 20kms in range! What a joke!<br><br>No matter how many types of missile, the engagement radar of S400/300 is always the same. Which means the profile will be the same.<br></div>
