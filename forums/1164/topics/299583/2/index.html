            <div class='col-md body'>If you think S400 is for intercepting ultra low flying, terrain following cruise missiles like  Tomahawk, then you should wonder why Russians, in practice, actually created low altitude air defense systems like  Tor-M1 and Tunguska to protect S-300/S-400 ADS from the attacks like cruise missiles &amp; other precision weapons?<br><br>S-300/400 systems are designed for theatre air defense with long range missiles to neutralize aggressors &amp; supporting planes at high altitude, by doing so, that will leave the poor radar coverage at low altitude and the long range SAM is in a difficult position to engage low flying cruise missiles prompted up from terrain in a short distance. ThatÂ’s why the low tier ADS like Tor-M1   and CIWS like Tunguska come to play. On the contrary, the Tomahawk by design is to follow terrain for guidance. Such flying profile determines the terrain will most likely block the line of sight of long range radars, so, itÂ’s not surprised to see a tomahawk suddenly emerges from the behind of a hill and let the S-300/S400 units no time to respond, however, Tor-M1 is designed to address this, the vehicle mounted radar spines very fast, providing a good update rate on horizon scan. The Tor SAM is designed to engage ultra low flying cruise missile usually flying just meters above the ground that let the long range SAMs like S-300/400 incapalbe to intercept at this stage.<br></div>

It's also unwise to say Tomahawk will fly at low heights throughout its flight. It may hit/strike unwanted objects/targets especially in rugged terrains.<br>Also S-400 being able to eliminate tomahawk at greater distances means even debris wont affect original targets of tomahawk. while tor-m1 or other low altitude short range defenses are sort of last resorts.<br><br>[quote]<br>S-300/400 systems are designed for theatre air defense with long range missiles to neutralize aggressors &amp; supporting planes at high altitude, by doing so, that will leave the poor radar coverage at low altitude and the long range SAM is in a difficult position to engage low flying cruise missiles prompted up from terrain in a short distance. ThatÂ’s why the low tier ADS like Tor-M1   and CIWS like Tunguska come to play. On the contrary, the Tomahawk by design is to follow terrain for guidance. Such flying profile determines the terrain will most likely block the line of sight of long range radars, so, itÂ’s not surprised to see a tomahawk suddenly emerges from the behind of a hill and let the S-300/S400 units no time to respond, however, Tor-M1 is designed to address this, the vehicle mounted radar spines very fast, providing a good update rate on horizon scan. The Tor SAM is designed to engage ultra low flying cruise missile usually flying just meters above the ground that let the long range SAMs like S-300/400 incapalbe to intercept at this stage.<br></div></blockquote>in short what you're saying is IF s-300/400 fails, then tor-m1 serves as another line of defence, the last line in fact and reacts quickly to any emergency or threat. but it's wiser to not bank on last minute reaction time to save your cities or your important centres of military economy politics etc, rather bank on longer range defence like s-400 or s-500 (coming up shortly).<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Proton, let me put in this way:  it seems you are the falling victim of Yanks media propaganda that illustrate Russia &amp; China are now capable to challenge The US of A in a global base, thatÂ’s just PentagonÂ’s  tricks to justify its hefty military budget that accounts for half of the world total. What we can see Russia &amp; China are basically playing defense only at their doorway instead. Yanks are using this technique only to scare small nations to fall into their influence and buying more of their arms.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>usa's budget is almost half of world's defense expenditure, but that's because in russia or china or developing countries you've lower costs, sometimes around 3 to 5 times lower.<br><br>whereas richer countries than usa in nordic countries, switzerland or some gcc countries, they dont spend much even per capita on defence. that's the real reason behind this unusually high expenditure of usa. when you factor these in, it doesn't look quite as much, although still a huge sum nonetheless.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Lol, Ignorance leads to annoyance!<br><br>The basic law of physics is the ray from the S-400 radar canÂ’t penetrate the radar horizon and will either bounce back or be absorbed by the terrain surface. If the Tomahawk is below the S-400Â’s radar horizon, then the radar canÂ’t detect the target even though it has the advertised maximum detection range in hundreds kms.  Mainly Depending on the height of the radar, the radar horizon in the open sea (the flattest terrain possible) is usually 20-40 kms.<br></div>

The S-400 might be good but without airborne radar or a series of radars placed farther out it's very limited in whart it can do.<br><br>Anyway like i've said before the S-400 has not been to war and it has not been tested in combat so by far and large it is only CLAIMED.<br>Heck i hardly even see it's test data.<br>Could you be so kind as to provide some?</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>As far as I know, the currently deployed S-400 is actually evolved from now defunct S300 PM3, so you can see the current S400 is basically the latest S-300 ADS.
