AK-47, M-16, SAR-21... its all c0ck n shoot.<br><br>No, I do not believe the PDW to be chopped down weapons for HQ troops to use.  PDWs are specialized weapons for special roles.  Roles that require the weapon to be shorter than normal, but greater firepower than a pistol.  That would fall into the SF category, or plain clothes security officers who need to conceal and carry.</div>

There is a mod kit around which could be added to other standard GLOCK pistols to make it fire full auto.  So it's not limited to just 9mm firing full auto using Glock 18; you can have full auto capability with other Glocks with different calibre .357, .40, .45 .380, 10mm <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br><br>See Glock 18 firing full auto<br><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-qOPZZ_W7Ik" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-qOPZZ_W7Ik</a></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by gunNut:</div><div class="quote_body">Thank you, yes I know about recoil and ammo.  All handguns will have considerable amount of recoil, it's a matter of your grip on the weapon. Go have a look at the Youtube link I posted earlier and see the recoil effect of auto firing GLOCK.<br><br>Unless the ST Compact Personal Weapon comes with a special ammo, I dun see its selling point.</div></blockquote>Just to have no doubt i have watched the several videos on youtube for your sake.<br><br>First thing i notice, the target board is not even 10 meters away and the stupid rounds are going all over the place. 30 rounds of 9mm calibre and the board barely got ripped open.  I can guess the effect of the glock on any combat armour worn by troops in combat. There would be little effect.<br><br>Watching the guy spray the drum mag on the glock, i laugh really really hard, You pick your drum mag with the glock and i pick our saw(mk 2 will do) with a similar capacity drum mag and we both be 100 metres apart. Lets see who destroys a figure 11 target board first when we both go prone.<br><br>Unless the glock comes with proximity detonation frag warheads, i dont see any point to it being superior to any SMG which we have access to.<br><br>However, to be more precise, the point is the ST compact weapon is already comparable in purpose and maybe performance to your glock auto. The only difference being we dont have to pay for the manufacturing license to glock  AND the compact weapon by ST is already a reality (making them in house is always better i feel).<br><br>These are all but machine pistols anyway. What's the standard ammo load you think will go with just one machine pistol?  To fight even more than 1 min in a retrogade you will burn off i dont know how many mags, hitting and killing any one not withstanding. I dont know about you, but standing the way the guy in the videos was standing while in combat looks very stupid to me.<br><br>Not that i think that's the proper way to stand while in combat, standing and shooting is the wrong thing to do just to clarify.  The point is in all demo videos like this one, normally it shows the -best- or most -optimum- performance of the gun.  yes the glock didnt jam, i'm impressed.  Is it practical to be issue to our non combat personnel? No.  Not the ST compact weapon either. I dont even know why they bother to make and market one in the first place.<br><br>I really doubt the machine pistols(auto pistols) practicality since, you will get better balistics performance by using similar ammunition and putting them in a not so much bigger SMG like MP5. Same ammo, more capability.  Overall less space and weight.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>The CPW is not in production yet. It is currently being developed with 9mm ammunition, but also designed to be compatible with other calibers with the changing of certain parts.<br><br>Targeted for personnel in tight surroundings with not much space to maneuver, such as pilots, air crew, and armour personnel.</div>

M16/AR-15 Carbines are way better for support/log troops......much better than a RoboCop gun.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Yes, of course the M16 has been proven in battle to be a reliable weapon. However air crew men/pilots have limited space to swing their weapons around. In situations such as urban warfare, a standard assault rifle may also hinder movement and give away location.<br><br>This explains the development of sub-machine guns like the MP5, however reliable, accurate and situation proven they are, use 9mm ammunition which doesn't work against bulletproof vests. This partly led to the development of PDWs which use special ammunition able to penetrate the NATO standard body armour.<br><br>The CPW is targeted somewhat along that lines, to be able to provide the compactness of a pistol but accuracy and firepower of a rifle.</div>
