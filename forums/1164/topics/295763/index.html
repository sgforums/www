Combining the designs of hand held compact pistols and sophisticated sighting systems with a retractable butt-stock feature of a full sized submachine gun, the CPW is replacing the use of handguns, submachine guns and even rifles in all aspects of military and law enforcement operations that require compact firepower.</blockquote><a href="http://www.stengg.com/CoyCapPro/detail.aspx?pdid=399" rel="nofollow">http://www.stengg.com/CoyCapPro/detail.aspx?pdid=399</a><br><br>Replacing our SAF handguns for officers?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"></div>

So maybe they decided to take the 5.7mm portion and develop it into a standalone " CPW " (why not PDW? why not SMG?).<br><br>The website didn't say what calibre but my bet is that it comes in 5.7mm.<br><br>Why?<br><br>Because 9mm or other sub calibres have never been very popular with STK. and business-wise, they probably figured that the global market is over-flowing with 9mm weapons already. So since they have a license from FN to fool around with the 5.7mm calibre, they're putting it to good use.<br><br>...<br><br>Concerning the weapon itself, it looks very " Robocop " and quite reminiscent of HK MP7, but at probably half the price.<br><br>(And also, in the PDW calibre, HK's 4.6mm seem to be losing ground to FN's 5.7mm.)<br><br>The only advantage of this weapon layout of magazine in pistol grip is that it allows for putting into a leg or hip holster.<br><br>For police this looks less aggressive and for army, this frees both hands for doing other stuff.<br><br>Just my personal opinion.</div>

The famous Uzi is just such a weapon. it all depends on the individual weapon's overall design.<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by equlus84:</div><div class="quote_body">The ST webbe claims this weapon is gonna replace police/army armaments, huh?? why? </div></blockquote>My problem with most SMG or PDW or CPW is that, they are almost as bulky as a carbine, though shorter. Nut they fire a short range round that is also less lethal. And even for clerks and cooks, if the HQ is attacked by enemy, I would prefer a carbine to such a small calibre weapon.<br><br>For army officers of a very senior rank un the field, would you want to have such a heavy load strapped to you at all times? Better to stick to pistol with a carbine on standby.<br><br>In military this looks more suitable for certain kinds of special ops.<br><br>...<br><br>For normal police patrol, this is overkill. The PC will get body ache with this thing strapped to the leg for whole day.<br><br>Maybe for show of force like installation patrols, Reserve Units and SWAT etc.</div>

Having the weight of a loaded magazine in the pistol grip helps keep the weapon's center of mass closer to where the shooter is holding the weapon with his strong hand. Also, as the magazine gets lighter when the weapon is discharged, there is almost no shift in the center of mass.</div>

Only those Pes C may recieve firearms training depending on medical excuse.  Ditto for Storemen.<br><br>Most of these Clerks and storemen head for their logistic or administrative training schools straight out of BMT.  There they learn tools of their trade, which does not include PDW handling.  Any firearms they'd have learnt to handle, would be learnt in BMT. And that would limit it to the M-16 or in the future, SAR-21.</div>
