              <p>China says it plans to increase military spending by nearly 18% this year, to 417.8bn yuan ($59bn; £30bn). The figure was revealed ahead of China's annual parliamentary session, which begins on Wednesday.</p>
              <p>Other nations have expressed concern about China's growing military power, and say Beijing is not open enough about what it is spending its money on.</p>
              <p>Washington claims that the real Chinese defence budget is at least double the stated amount.</p>
              <p>In an annual Pentagon report released hours before China's defence spending announcement, the US highlighted particular concern over Chinese activities in both space and cyberspace.</p>
              <p>China said it rejected the Pentagon report as a "serious distortion of facts" that could harm relations between the two nations.</p>
              <p>"It breaks international norms... We do not pose a threat to any country. The US should drop its Cold War mentality," the foreign ministry said in a statement.</p>
              <p>But China said... Most of this year's military increase will be spent on increasing salaries and accommodating higher oil prices, according to Jiang Enzhu, a spokesman for China's National People's Congress, which begins its annual meeting on Wednesday. Mr Jiang said spending on armaments would rise only moderately.</p>
              <p>"China pursues a national defence policy that is defensive in nature," he said.</p>
              <p>"China's limited military capability is solely for the purpose of safeguarding independence, sovereignty and territorial integrity, and does not pose a threat to any other country."</p>
              <p>He added that China spent less on defence, as a proportion of GDP, than the US, UK, France and Russia.</p>
              <p>But the international community remains concerned.</p>

              <p>Not entirely true. IIRC they are boosting their amphibious capabilities as well as their submarine force disproportionate to 'upgrading'. They are also trying to raise a viable carrier force. At the same time, they are shrinking their ground force while making it more mobile. All this points towards a more offensive-oriented role.</p>
              <p>Of course, by definition they are not in an arms race, because to be in an arms race, both parties have to have technological parity, roughly speaking. The Chinese are not there yet, but I think they will get there far faster than anybody expects, even with their still sizeable and fairly unwieldy force structure.</p>

              <p>Exactly. In fact, that is their publicly stated goal; to slim down the army and upgrade its technology and improve training methodology. And I'm pretty sure that their new training manuals are not going to be copied from the old Soviet manuals ;)</p>

              <p>I don't think they can invade, but the loss of about 100 billion USD in trade surplus, most of which is going to support the Chinese military expansion, would probably deter the Chinese from acting too foolishly?</p>
              <p>Ultimately the Chinese see the US as a rival more than a friend-- I think their recent outburst against the US to cover the riots in Tibet shows that. That said though, it is true that there are no permanent friends in international relations, just national interest.</p>

              <p>that's true.. but like it or not, china is going to be a major power in world politics...</p>
              <p>and being one, you can't expect China to not upgrade it capabilities to be on par with USA rite?? besides, america and china disagree on so many issues, having a strong military enables china to stand on more even footing against the usa....</p>
              <p>and with the threat of a american attack on chinese territory, albeit very minor chance but still possible due to taiwan issue, attaining parity with american military is imperative for the chinese... unless the taiwan secession issue can be settled soon and peacefully, the rate of chinese military spending will not decrease...</p>

              <p>I don't think China is a country that would go on a "world conquest" campaign.  Its military is used to secure and protect its national interests, be it Taiwan, Spratly's or N.Korea. </p>
              <p>Do not think the Chinese Leadership to be dumb warmongering fools.  Chinese are some of the most shrewd businessmen next to the Jews.  Why resort to arms when they can benefit more economically.</p>
              <p>More importantly, it has need of a strong military counter balance in the pacific if it doesn't want to be blockaded in again.  SLOCs are big on the Chinese agenda as well.</p>

              <p>Well I agree that the Chinese Leadership are definitely smart and shrewd enough (and with their position can take the longer view--unlike in a democracy like the US, ironically) not to go on a world conquest. Still, the three areas you pointed out are more than enough to result in a world war, or at the very least affect our national interest. Taiwan is a given, and it seems like every other country in south east asia claims some part of the Spratly island, while North Korea will always be troublesome.</p>
              <p>Also, the unchecked nationalism that the chinese government has actively fostered in the population really worries me. While good in the sense that it promotes national stability, there are times when even the government is unable to control populist sentiment, for example with regards to Japan.</p>
