            <div class='col-md body'>its hard for ppl to appreciate the circumstances they are in if they have been in such a circumstance for all their lives.<br><br>hence the older generation would have experienced firsthand the kind of quantum leap improvement in the stds of living and quality of life since our independence, while the younger generation have only experienced comfort since they are born.<br><br>as such its folly to ask them to compare what we have with other less fortunate countries. it jus the same as asking a kid from a middle income family to appreciate how lucky he is compared to a kid from a low income one. without first hand experience its hard to relate.<br><br>i guess its ok to complain - if its constructive, if its the on and off kind of getting things off our chests. however if its persistent and vehement outbursts, i think its better for the complainant to examine whether or not there are better and more meaningful ways. lower ur expectations? get ur message across to those who matter? leave? these are options we all have and we all get to choose between.</div>

An often used and tired cliche that comes to mind is "Ask not what your country can do for you, but what you can do for your country".   If everyone works towards that end, then things will move.   What I have put forward is idealistic.   Although I am to a large extent an idealist, I am even more of a realist and knows that that will never happen.<br><br>What is important in the issue is that we must have realistic expectations.</div>

Well, one said she could start up a small business with the money earned here.   Do they want to come back?   Well, at least half of them indicated so.<br><br>Why did they not stay?   Because they can't, with immigration and manpower laws.<br><br>I myself had considered seeking employment overseas.   If I do, I will still return as Singapore is Home.</div>

But I have to disagree your opinion with the other issue<br><br>Conversely, have you ever thought about how the family of 2SG Chua feels? Or been at the receiving end of a system that is too inflexible to consider the merits of each case, knowing that every case is unique and may have its own merits?<br><br>The reason for the uneven application of the law in the 3rd world country you have experienced is a result of Greed fueled by corruption. Not due to leeway to apply the law with flexibility. It's an atrocious example to make your point, IMO<br><br>I do feel lucky that I live in Singapore and not countries like Indonesia, Bangladesh or Cambodia. And I'm grateful for the fact that our policies have brought us up to where we are. But at the same time, I feel that these policies are exactly the ones that are hamstringing Singapore's aspirations to move up to the next level of development. This "no u-turn" mindset, this "we know better" mentality, this "Good grades= good person" idea. And thats just the beginning.<br><br>Your appreciation for the "stability" in Singapore is borne out of your experiences in poorer countries. That is perfectly clear and underandable. But at the same time, I urge to to understand that those who are calling for change have their ideas borne out of their own experiences living in countries that have gone to the next level of development.<br><br>As for your encouragement for unhappy Singaporeans to leave. I would seriously urge you to reconsider it. Do you think this brain drain is what Singapore needs? Those leaving are undoubtedly well off, well educated, have an ability to think beyond what they are spoonfed and dare to take risks. As Gedanken once said to me, these people are exactly what Singapore needs to move on and develop further. Not to mention these are Singaporeans and will have Singaporean kids. Sure we can make up those numbers with the "Cheap Foreign Labour" the government likes to mis-label as "Foriegn Talent". But if you think these people are here for the duration, you've got another think coming.<br><br>And yes, this topic is not relevant to the forum. You're welcome to restart it on Speakers Forum. In fact, theres already one like it there.<br><br><a href="http://www.sgforums.com/?action=thread_display&amp;thread_id=74463" rel="nofollow">The pros and cons of emigration   </a></div>

While I've met people who think the grass is greener on the other side based on hearsay and what they see on TV, an increasing number of Singaporeans are feeling disenchantment because they have personally lived their lives overseas. And even though its not all fun and games elsewhere, they can see that having less government control, true ballot box democracy, having a robust oppostion, a free press, a welfare state (of sorts) and a flexible bureaucracy will not tear a country apart like how the gah'ment keeps claiming those actions I listed above will do to Singapore.<br><br>I used to buy the government's line unquestioningly (see my very earliest posts on Speakers Corner) until I got the opportunity to live in Australia, see their system 1st hand and interact with Australians for 4 years.

While I know what you mean, having exercised that choice myself, Stalin could have claimed that all good Russians were given the choice to go to Siberia, and that they declined that choice by keeping their mouths shut.  Besides, it is a part of democracy that one may choose to stay within that society and whinge about it.<br><br><blockquote>Originally posted by dragonstar:<br>Academician, my dear boy, albeit ex-academician.
