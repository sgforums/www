Someone was mentioning to me that they tightened things up as there were too many officers last year or the year before. So they actually forced out those who weren't doing a "good enough job".<br><br>In my time in some place no one needs to know, the youngest officer who got a LTC rank was a 28 year old bugger. SAFOS too. Big surprise however. These guys start their true career in the SAF as CPT already. No kidding.</div>

(or at least from what I have seen. I might have missed out one or two exceptions or more.). They are then given their 3rd bar upon return. This is pretty much in line with the hyper accelerated ROA they have.<br><br>2 estabs well, typically 1.5-2years each? One on desk, one on the field? Might be shorter though.</div>
