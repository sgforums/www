            <div class='col-md body'>There is a good reason why the next rank above Captain isn't a fourth bar but a "crab".<br><br>From Captain to Major is a big jump.

Officers holding these positions can be Captains or Majors.<br><br>The Brigade S2 and S3 depts, for example, are more likely to have Majors or Captains about to become Majors - as their roles are more important than that of the S1 and S4, which are more of a supportive role and may be required to take orders from the S2 or S3.<br><br>In the Brigade HQ where I served my NS the S1 and S4 were "hentak-kaki" Captains well into their 40's. They look destined to serve out their contract as Captains.<br><br>The Bde Cmd in the Brigade where I served - a LTC - treated the S2 (Cpt) and S3 (Maj) as his colleagues, almost equals. But he let it be known the S1 amd S4 (both Cpt), are mere sideshows.

What the fcuk do you think you are doing?!" in front of all us lowly impressionable NSFs. No easy ride.<br><br>For some positions, Captains may be required to attend courses at SCSC - Singapore Command and Staff College (otherwise known as "Some Can Some Cannot" ) to get further. That's how my Brigade S2 Captain got his "crab" when I met him again during my reservist. By then, he was G2 - a Int. Officer at Division level, which means he will again be open for his second "crab" if he doesn't screw up. He could probably stay at G2 or could mean he might need to take up another position like Bde Cmd to get his next "crab"... dunno. Beyond Brgade level I have no idea.<br><br>I was attached to SCSC for a couple of weeks to helpout with the "undergrads" doing a MAPEX.<br><br>There were officers from the Air Force as well, and a few foreigners from ASEAN attending.

What department?<br><br>During reservist, I got knocked down to Bn HQ, and then after that got 'knocked down" somemore to rifle company. The Bn S2 wanted to overturn the posting but I said no. Quite sick of wearing a uniform but not being with the real troops.</div></blockquote>I was too fit and gung ho to be in HQ&gt;LOL .I was down graded for a while but I asked to be upgraded so I could go back to company line. I oso Wont tell you which Brigate(it's the 7th Brigate)hahaha but the Brigate Commander wore a stupid hat macam Indiana Jones like that and the S4 was a fat fark CB mouth and a disgrace to the uniform.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>For any "tann jia peng" career officer, the minimum rank is Cpt.
