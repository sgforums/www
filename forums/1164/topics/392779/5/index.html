              LM with the lexington institute strikes back on the cost...
              
              http://www.lexingtoninstitute.org/the-f-35-will-cost-about-what-an-f-16-costs?a=1&amp;c=1129
              
              Based on what the prime contractor has actually charged the government to date for three successive lots of fighters, the unit recurring flyaway cost for the most common version of the F-35 will be about $60 million in today's dollars. That's roughly what the latest variants of the F-16 and F/A-18 fighters cost, and less than half what an F-22 costs. The Pentagon estimates the F-35 will cost some higher amount, but its estimates have consistently been well above what the contractor actually charged. 
              
              In fact, in the current negotiations for the fourth production lot, Lockheed Martin is proposing a price far below Pentagon estimates, and government negotiators in turn are trying to get a price below what Lockheed Martin is proposing.

              <p><br>Firstly, the fighters aren't outclassed, more like the suks and eurocanards have caught up. And despite the stealth PAK-FA, it won't be entering inventories anytime soon.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Secondly, with thousands of 3rd/4th gen fighters, its still an advantage in terms of numbers (so long as the maintenance issues are settled) when everyone else has hundreds. </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>As to downsides to democrat presidencies, there is a huge difference between fiscal prudence and spending $5000 on a toilet seat. The qn of affordability tends to appear in democratic presidencies. One might make an argument that republican presidencies are more destructive to future military budgets (ie spending through borrowings is just deferring payments to later which kills future spending).</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>With 187 F-22s and 2,443 F-35s not counting allies, that's still going to be more than everyone else.</p>

              <p>The F15SG is the most advanced F15 yet, even though its 40 years old. Somethings, when you buy things....you need to see what comes with it. We all know, the F15 may not match up with the new Eurofighter in Stealth, in weapons systems and performance, but US alliance is worth much more than what plane you fly.</p>
              <p>If you fly a Eurofighter, you need to buy engine parts from one country, subjected to approval from another, get French strikes, and pay high prices for German unions, and wing parts from Toulouse, Electronics from Finland....the plane will be a nightmare to keep let alone fly...and it will have issues with the weapons systems.....if you are thinking of an integrated approach to defense, you need something that will work with your AWACs, your weaponry on the F16s must work also on the new plane and common parts suppliers.....that is called prudence.</p>
              <p>Otherwise, you end up with a rojak air force with 30 different suppliers for the same parts and no standard guy to supply them....in short, your planes are good for the museum 3 years on....like some people's air force.....</p>
              <p>This is one thing good about not having corruption in the system.</p>

              <p>It is nevertheless a big basket. F-15s and F-16s represent a good mix but there are significant benefits from joint ops, eg with RAF, RAAF, USAF.</p>
              <p>Access to US provide USAF pilots, munitions, reserve aircraft when needed. Israel 1973 provides an example where F-4s, munitions were sent via cargo planes to Israel to top up depleting inventories. This may also have included USAF pilots.</p>
              <p>Soviets did that in North Korea as well where russki pilots flew in NK planes but that won't come with other European purchases.</p>
              <p>I'd like to understand how the F-15 doesn't match up to Eurofighter? It has better TW, sensors, carries more and better munitions and in the latest variant (which can be retrofit to the SG), comes with stealth. Also, delivery schedules met rsaf requirements.</p>

              Can a big basket of differing a/c types be similarly dropped? &lt;- Yes. So what's the advantage of diversification when the cost is evident?
              
              If a war occurs, one can have rsaf pilots in usaf a/c or usaf pilots in rsaf a/c. But if eurofighter/migs was procured, will that happen?
              
              There are advantages to big basket eg lower cost of training, better training, more access to parts, better serviceability etc. Are migs/eurofighters better? I don't think so.
              
              Bottom line: Its a risk that rsaf/dsta/mindef has decided is worth taking. I agree.

              <p>And what makes one think the Russkis or the Europeans won't drop the basket? In fact, they'd probably do it faster when it suits them. The french did it to the israelis.</p>
              <p>The only way one can avoid that is to have self sufficiency. But can SG build its own fighters?</p>

              <p><br>Its too simplistic. If rsaf had russki or european alternatives, what makes you think your US basket is still there?</p>
              <p>Getting another alternatives involves cost, integration, training, structures, and a whole other gamut. Easy to say just buy. In fact, we can probably and just as easily get more fighters from economies of scale by buying from the same supplier. This esp when the planes/tech of alternatives may not even be as effective.</p>
              <p>Worse, by buying alternatives, one is opened to a lot more consideration ie have to satisfy/three leg more parties. Here, you only need to do it for one.</p>
              <p>Its not really all eggs in one basket either. Things like missiles can be diversified eg Derby/Mica or Python/Asraam instead of Amraams/sidewinders. Iran kept their F-4s/F-14s flying. rsaf already has good exposures with the A-4. </p>
              <p>But most importantly, the reality is that there isn't going to be any "dropping" from the US anytime in the next few decades. If anything, the relationship is getting closer and both sides want it to be that way.</p>
              <p>If things do turn sour, diversification can occur eg indonesia. Aircraft procurement is not a once off. However, one leverages on advantages where one can.</p>

              <p>You mean you cannot have Russian &amp;  European fighter alternatives when you have US aircraft   ?  </p>
              <p>The RMAF has F18s, F5s, MIG29s and SU30s.</p>
              <p>The Pakistani AF has F16s, Mirage III, Mirage V, F7s , A5s</p>

              <p>Indian AF has  MIG29, SU30, Jaguar, Hawk, Mirage 2000 &amp; are considering F18s, Typhoons etc</p>
              <p>The list goes on....................</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Your are insulting the RSAF. Singapore, DSTA, SAF &amp; especially the RSAF are extremely well known globally to be  first class procurement agencies. They do not  " sar kar " anyone. Please apologise immediately to the RSAF.</p>
              <p>The US administration changes every 4 years &amp; with each change policies change.</p>
              <p>Just because we &amp; others may seem close to the USA now  does not guarantee a cozy relationship tomorrow. You forget there was a time when RSAF cud not purchase top of line fighters from the US  -  we were then allowed to purchase   F16-79s or F20s   rather than the F16A. Also,  the US refused release of source codes when we wanted to purchase air to air radars for our F5s. We went to the Italians instead.  </p>
              <p>Waiting for someone to drop us is a poor strategy. When it happens it be too late. A  fighter squadron  takes many years to be operational. </p>

              <p>lol. Again another simplistic comparison. The RMAF has done so well that they will be phasing out their Mig-29s faster than their F-5s. By your standard, we should get rid of our engines, malaysian style and buy short life fighters? The malaysians spend half our budget to have an airfleet less than half our current size.</p>
              <p>Pakistan is so fantastic that they went to buy F-16s right after they got embargoed for it.</p>
