              <p style="margin-left: 1in;"><strong><span style="font-family: Arial; color: blue; font-size: 10pt;">Since you brought up issue of your<span>  </span>dick ( &amp; in case you have not noticed ), there is a big difference between your dick &amp; an IRST. IRST is a passive device while your dick is <span> </span>a highly active</span></strong><span style="font-family: Arial; color: blue; font-size: 10pt;"> <span> </span><strong>( hopefully ) one.</strong></span></p>
              <p style="margin-left: 1in;"><strong><span style="font-family: Arial; color: blue; font-size: 10pt;">All the new gen fighters have their IRSTs ( as opposed to exposed dicks )<span>  </span>built into the airframe design. Oh …. <span> </span>by the way, <span> </span>is your dick integrated into your frame or is it also podded ( or shud I say strapped on )<span>  </span>??</span></strong></p>
              <p style="margin-left: 1in;"><strong><span style="font-family: Arial; color: blue; font-size: 10pt;">Back in the days when the US <span> </span>thought that the gun was no longer <span> </span>needed in fighters, podded guns had to be introduced to make up the deficit. <span> </span>In the same vein, <span> </span>as IRSTs are now becoming extremely more capable, they are from the onset built into the new gen airframes . So<span>  </span>for old gen aircraft without this capability,<span>  </span><span> </span>a podded system fills the need without having to modify the airframe. It is an expedient solution to a pressing need. <span> </span><span> </span></span></strong></p>
              <p style="margin-left: 1in;"><em><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">Typhoon was design with captor radar, and when it was design AESA radar does not exist. Thus we can agree that it was not design for AESA radar. But did that stop Typhoon from getting AESA radar ? No, planes are just platforms that have empty spaces on board for you to put various equipment on it. Does not mean when you first design it - the equipment must die die be design in. One thing F-15 does have more room for various equipment.</span></em></p>

              <p style="margin-left: 1in;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">lol. Janes also claim Singapore operates the longshot wingkit and a host of other things. In reality, it was flightglobal who first mentioned that LM was offering the AAS-42 (and that was back in 2001) as part of the tigereyes suite.</span></p>
              <p style="margin-left: 1in;"><strong><span style="font-family: Arial; color: blue; font-size: 10pt;">Dear Weasel, </span></strong></p>
              <p style="margin-left: 1in;"><strong><span style="font-family: Arial; color: blue; font-size: 10pt;">I <span> also </span>do think <span> </span>that even highly reputable publications such as Janes ( &amp; many other publications including FlightGlobal <span> </span>) do make some errors in reporting – occassionaly.<span>  </span>But<span>  </span>how do you know <span> </span>what is reported in incorrect<span>  </span>?<span>  </span><span> </span></span></strong></p>
              <p style="margin-left: 1in;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">However, what I do question is the designation cos LM's offering does not appear to be designated.</span></p>
              <p style="margin-left: 1in;"><a href="http://www.lockheedmartin.com/news/press_releases/2002/LockheedMartinWins163MillionOrderFo.html"><span style="color: purple;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">http://www.lockheedmartin.com/news/press_releases/2002/LockheedMartinWins163MillionOrderFo.html</span></span></span></a></p>
              <p style="margin-left: 1in;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">What LM does say is that</span></p>
              <p style="margin-left: 1in;"><span style="font-family: Times-Roman;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">"The (current) IRST system enhances the capabilities of the F-14D AN/AAS-42 IRST that had been operational aboard U.S. aircraft carriers and accumulated over 200,000 flight hours."</span></span></p>
              <p style="margin-left: 1in;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">Its a derivative, not static. But if you agree the AIM-120D is the same as the AIM-120A, then of course in the same basis, the IRST on the F-15 and F-18s must necessarily be the AAS-42 used on the F-14.</span></p>
              <p style="margin-left: 1in;"><span style="font-family: Times-Roman;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">More important is your claim that the pirate is supposed to be superior to the F-15 IRST.</span></span></p>
              <p style="margin-left: 1in;"><strong><span style="font-family: Arial; color: blue; font-size: 10pt;">See what I mean , the reference above to AN/AAS-42 is from 2002. That is quite a long time ago. AN/AAS-42 was developed long before 2002. </span></strong></p>

              <p style="margin-left: 1in;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">Even selex doesn't claim as such. This you have not addressed.</span></p>
              <p style="margin-left: 1in;"><strong><span style="font-family: Arial; color: blue; font-size: 10pt;">They do not need to make such a claim. <span> </span>Do you see any BMW<span>  </span>adverts to claim <span> </span>that a BMW is superior to a Skoda <span> </span>? </span></strong></p>
              <p style="margin-left: 1in;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">As to your claim that the meteor has 5 times the range of the AIM-120D, I won't even bother to address that except to highlight that if the missile exceeds 300km which it would have to in order to exceed the range by 5 times, then MTCR will kick in and its export barred.</span></p>

              <p style="margin-left: 1in;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">Equally important, IFF/target ID can't operate at that range. If one fires blind, neutral/civilian targets are at risk.</span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt 1in;"><strong><span style="font-family: Arial; color: blue; font-size: 10pt;">Ever heard of<span>  </span>AWAC, NCTR, IFF, data links, EW , data fusion …………………??</span></strong></p>
              <p style="margin-left: 1in;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">FYI, the AIM-120D is actually the export competitor/equivalent. Raytheon originally competed on the acronym FMRAAM. The idea was to provide an ERAAM+ (today known as the C-5, C-7 appears to be the ++ version) as an interim before the -D was actually developed. The meteor won the competition in 2000 cos the assessment was that the raytheon FMRAAM program was high risk but the amraam (eraam+) was nevertheless procured cos the Eurofighter would enter service before the meteor.</span></p>
              <p style="margin-left: 1in;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">As to the AIM-120D being in low rate production, does not appear to be the case. It has replaced the C-7 production from lots 23 onwards and at my last count, 807 have been ordered for both navy and airforce.</span></p>
              <p style="margin-left: 1in;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">As to the AIM-120D being over-budget, link pls. My understanding is behind schedule, yes. Above cost, no.</span></p>

Continuing delays in resolving developmental hardware issues and less-than-expected effectiveness in flight test execution are the primary reasons for the SDD program being behind schedule. The current forecast date for the functional configuration audit is no 30 April 09, ten months later than planned with a contract completion date of 30 June 09. The schedule extension increased the contract cost by approximately 10 percent, which is available with the existing program budget.”<span>  </span><span> </span><span> </span></span></em><em><span style="color: blue;"></span></em></strong></p>
              <p style="margin-left: 1in;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;"> </span></p>
              <p style="margin-left: 1in;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">As to the rsaf receiving the AIM-120D, well, don't expect the rsaf to receive the meteor before all the european partners first either.</span></p>
              <p style="margin-left: 1in;"><strong><span style="font-family: Arial; color: blue; font-size: 10pt;">You are right.  But<span>  </span>did I <span> </span>say that RSAF will have priority<span>  </span>to receive Meteor even if it wanted to purchase it<span>  </span>? <span> </span>So when will AIM120 D be released for RSAF<span>  </span>use <span> </span><span> </span>?  I did  not know the RSAF  will be receiving AIM 120 Ds - please show some proof. </span></strong></p>
              <p style="margin-left: 1in;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">There's a lot of hype surrounding the typhoon. Potential this, potential that but all is only potential. Sure, there could be even a potential stealth typhoon. </span><strong><span style="font-family: Arial; color: blue; font-size: 10pt;">You hit the nail exactly on the head.<span>  </span>I too believe that there cud be a potential for stealth Typhoon<span>  </span>- maybe call it Silent Typhoon – that will a great name you think <span>    </span>? <span>  </span><span> </span></span></strong></p>
              <p style="margin-left: 1in;"><strong><span style="font-family: Arial; color: blue; font-size: 10pt;">Believe me , there is even more hype<span> </span>in the potential for 1970s<span>  </span>F15s. <span> </span><span> </span><span> </span></span></strong></p>
              <p style="margin-left: 1in;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">Yet, what is clear is that the F-15 not only has the major capabilities, those are already existing capabilities without it being a "potential". </span></p>
              <p style="margin-left: 1in;"><strong><span style="font-family: Arial; color: blue; font-size: 10pt;">My thoughts exactly, thanks. <span> </span>But please don’t forget to delete the Typhoon -like BVR<span>  </span>capabilities as there is no possiblity of this happening for the F15.  <span> </span></span></strong></p>
              <p style="margin-left: 1in;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">F-15SE already incorporates stealth. The SG can be upgraded to the SE standard. The -SG can fire all the current munitions and will be equipped with those in development eg JDRADM/NCADE/MALD etc will similarly equip it. That is not a guarantee for the typhoon/rafale and even if it could, would be later. </span></p>
              <p style="margin-left: 1in;"><strong><span style="font-family: Arial; color: blue; font-size: 10pt;">In life there are no guarantees.</span></strong><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;"> </span><strong><span style="font-family: Arial; color: blue; font-size: 10pt;">What I can guarantee though is that at the moment there is no US equivalent to Meteor - not even on the drawing board -  unless it is a black project of course.  </span></strong></p>
              <p style="margin-left: 1in;"><strong><span style="font-family: Arial; color: blue; font-size: 10pt;">There are degrees of stealth.<span>  Applying </span>some radar absorbent paint will definitely make an aircraft<span>  </span>- any aircraft -<span>  </span>more stealthy -  1 % better ? <span> </span></span></strong></p>
              <p style="margin-left: 1in;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">Sure, the possibility that Matra may one day develop a 10000km ranged A2A ICBM with 100% accuracy that will be capable of being fired from the typhoon cannot be discounted in the future. The eurofighter consortium may even develop a stealth paint that makes the eurofighter invisible to radar, IR and every single medium. But that is only hot air at the moment. Acquisition decisions cannot be based on hot air.</span></p>
              <p style="margin-left: 1in;"><strong><span style="font-family: Arial; color: blue; font-size: 10pt;">An ICBM<span>  </span>is<span>  </span>not an AAM <span> </span><span> </span>- <span> </span>see what I mean when I said earlier that you are confused. <span> </span>From <span> </span>the time you wrote the first line to the last line of<span>  </span>your reply , your mental condition has deteriorated faster than a speeding Meteor. <span> </span></span></strong></p>
              <p style="margin-left: 1in;"><strong><span style="font-family: Arial; color: blue; font-size: 10pt;">You know, <span> </span>a paint to make a plane <span> </span>invisible may not be in the realm of science fiction after all. <span>  </span><span> </span>I hope <span> </span>that <span> </span>you are right and that Eurofighter<span>  </span>comes out with this paint in the future. Maybe it can then be applied to the F 15 <span> </span>so that it has a chance to match Typhoon’s capabilities in the far away future. <span> </span></span></strong></p>

              <p>Just wanted to clarify some points. </p>
              <p>The missile technology control regime governs missile technology transfer. Whilst prevention of WMDs spread is one of its objects, arguing that missile technology used for A2A can be distinguished from A2G is incorrect. This is more evident with tech like the JDRADM which has dual use. Even UAVs fall under the ambit of delivery systems within the concern of the MTCR. To say that A2A missile tech aren't covered is incorrect. It applies equally. </p>
              <p>With respect to the AIM-120D release to rsaf, the C-7 has been released to the F-15SG. I would like to ask how many meteor or C-7 has been released to typhoon operators as of today? Yet another potential? The answer would address the question. </p>
              <p>In 1982, UK requested and US released the AIM-9L which was then not cleared for export yet for use in the falklands war. Whilst SG may not have bought the -D yet, does it preclude rsaf from requesting if the need arises? We can't exactly request for the meteor right now, isn't it...... </p>
              <p>The answer to the question as to when the AIM-120D will be bought by the rsaf is as clear as the date in which meteor would have been bought by the rsaf if rsaf had selected the typhoon. </p>
              <p>As to Amraam cost overrun, the words used is that it is over-budget (see page 2). I'm merely highlighting that "over-budget" is incorrect. There is a difference between higher cost, and over-budget. The aim of any program is to minimise cost but being on-budget with a higher cost than expected is very different from being over-budget. Just look at the A-400M program. Whilst cost has exceeded estimates, it is still within budget for the aim-120d program. That is a feat in today's procurement world. </p>
              <p>Going back to reason why this is being discussed, using budgeted figures for the Aim-120D (even with the cost overruns) would suggest that the 120D would be cheaper to procure than the meteor. That is further supported by official links (accessible in wiki at the pages covering the two missiles), which suggest a difference in price by a factor of two. </p>
              <p>As to range, it was mentioned that the meteor outranged the AIM-120D by the multiple of 5. "by a multiple of 5" is ordinarily interpreted as 5 times longer range. If this is incorrect, do share what is the correct interpretation. Now if you had used the word "factor", then what "factor" means may have been a bit more debatable. </p>
              <p>This is different from a mere claim of longer range. Having said that, I doubt if anyone would be in a position to actually claim that, seeing that range is generally classified for the missiles. </p>
              <p>As to the definition of ICBM, whilst not necessarily ballistic, a 10,000km ranged AAM would certainly qualify as inter-continental. As it was intended as a tongue in cheek response, I took the liberty of highlighting that there is no reason why nuke-tipped AAMs could not be a missile of the future, esp when we are merely talking about are potential capabilities. If they could put nukes onto ASMs and ASW weapons, certainly no reason why it can't be done for AAMs in the future. If one thinks it is ridiculous, it merely highlights how ridiculous talking about potential can get. </p>
              <p>Whilst we're at it, might as well add laser-beam x-wing typhoon. Boeing's recent laser capability successes certainly makes the tech likely to be adopted in the typhoon rather than the F-15. Once that's integrated, it will make the X-wing typhoon the top of its class. Fantastic. Too bad the rsaf never got the typhoon? lol :p </p>
              <p>Seriously, arguing that the typhoon is going to be better than the F-15 cuts little ice. Still have not read anything objective that remotely suggests the typhoon has a distinct advantage over the F-15SG yet (with emphasis on "distinct" and caveats on differing interpretations of what "distinct" means) or will be in the near future (even with the introduction of meteor). </p>

              <p style="margin-left: 1in;"><strong><span style="font-family: Arial; color: blue;">Dear Weasel, </span></strong></p>
              <p style="margin-left: 1in;"><strong></strong></p>
              <p style="margin-left: 1in;"><strong><span style="font-family: Arial; color: blue;">Just wanted to say that according to MTCR website , their aim is to restrict proliferation of missiles, rockets, UAV &amp; related technology capable of carrying 500 kg payload at least 300 km.<span>  </span>Clearly,  MTCR’s primary aim is to restrict WMD.</span></strong></p>
              <p style="margin-left: 1in;"><strong><span style="font-family: Arial; color: blue;">Therefore, your claim that Meteor is covered by MTCR<span>  </span>is extremely tenuous to say the least.</span></strong></p>
              <p style="margin-left: 1in;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">With respect to the AIM-120D release to rsaf, the C-7 has been released to the F-15SG.

              <p style="margin-left: 1in;"><strong><span style="font-family: Arial; color: blue;">C7 is now the current production standard being delivered for all export customers authorized to receive them, including F15SG. <span>  </span></span></strong></p>
              <p style="margin-left: 1in;"><strong><span style="font-family: Arial; color: blue;">C5 was current standard starting in the early 2000s. </span></strong></p>
              <p style="margin-left: 1in;"><strong><span style="font-family: Arial; color: blue;">C5s are no longer the standard being <span style="text-decoration: underline;">manufactured</span> in the production lines , only C7s. </span></strong></p>
              <p style="margin-left: 1in;"><strong><span style="font-family: Arial; color: blue;">It is not an issue of C7s being released or not to Typhoons. Current AIM 120 equipped Typhoons may have only C5s simply because these were procured during the earlier production lots. NATO partners will also receive C7s when they place new orders. </span></strong></p>
              <p style="margin-left: 1in;"><strong><span style="font-family: Arial; color: blue;">You and everyone else know darn well that Meteor is still in development, so<span>  </span>asking<span>  </span>how many Meteors are being released to anyone is a darn stupid question.</span></strong></p>
              <p style="margin-left: 1in;"><strong><span style="font-family: Arial; color: blue;"> </span></strong></p>

So <span> </span><span> </span>they blew the budget. </span></strong></p>
              <p style="margin-left: 1in;"><strong><span style="font-family: Arial; color: blue;">The only feat I can see is that you are oblivious to the plain truth.</span></strong></p>

              <p style="margin-left: 1in;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">AIM 120 D </span></p>
              <p style="margin-left: 1in;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">As to range, it was mentioned that the meteor outranged the AIM-120D by the multiple of 5. "by a multiple of 5" is ordinarily interpreted as 5 times longer range. If this is incorrect, do share what is the correct interpretation. Now if you had used the word "factor", then what "factor" means may have been a bit more debatable. </span></p>
              <p style="margin-left: 1in;"><strong><span style="font-family: Arial; color: blue;">Like I said , please ask Janes –<span>  </span>they reported it<span>  </span>- I have already provided you with the reference <span> </span>- please check it out. Meteor has also been reported to have at least a 160 km range. <span> </span>Now tell me is that  much longer ranged than AIM120 ?  It is not inconceivable that  Meteor has a much longer range than earlier reported or claimed. </span></strong></p>
              <p style="margin-left: 1in;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">This is different from a mere claim of longer range. Having said that, I doubt if anyone would be in a position to actually claim that, seeing that range is generally classified for the missiles. </span></p>
              <p style="margin-left: 1in;"><strong><span style="font-family: Arial; color: blue;">I believe that the developers of Meteor <span> </span>know what they are talking about , or do you think that they are also lying. </span></strong></p>
              <p style="margin-left: 1in;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">As to the definition of ICBM, whilst not necessarily ballistic, a 10,000km ranged AAM would certainly qualify as inter-continental. As it was intended as a tongue in cheek response, I took the liberty of highlighting that there is no reason why nuke-tipped AAMs could not be a missile of the future, esp when we are merely talking about are potential capabilities. </span></p>
              <p style="margin-left: 1in;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">If they could put nukes onto ASMs and ASW weapons, certainly no reason why it can't be done for AAMs in the future. If one thinks it is ridiculous, it merely highlights how ridiculous talking about potential can get. </span></p>
              <p style="margin-left: 1in;"><strong><span style="font-family: Arial; color: blue;">Nuke air to air weapons such as Genie are consigned to history. Obviously no potential here. </span></strong></p>
              <p style="margin-left: 1in;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">Whilst we're at it, might as well add laser-beam x-wing typhoon. Boeing's recent laser capability successes certainly makes the tech likely to be adopted in the typhoon rather than the F-15. Once that's integrated, it will make the X-wing typhoon the top of its class. Fantastic. Too bad the rsaf never got the typhoon? lol :p </span></p>
              <p style="margin-left: 1in;"><strong><span style="font-family: Arial; color: blue;">What's<span>  </span>a<span>   </span>“ laser-beam x-wing typhhon ” <span> </span>? <span> </span><span> </span>Are you now using sci fi <span>  </span>for<span>  </span><span> </span>your arguments<span>  </span>?</span></strong></p>
              <p style="margin-left: 1in;"><strong><span style="font-family: Arial; color: blue;">You mean ABL ? That’s on a 747 or are you saying that this can also be fitted into a fighter soon <span> </span>? <span> </span></span></strong></p>
              <p style="margin-left: 1in;"><strong><span style="font-family: Arial; color: blue;">Never got the Typhoon <span> </span>? <span> </span>Like I said<span>  </span>maybe RSAF <span> </span>shud - one day. <span> </span></span></strong></p>
              <p style="margin-left: 1in;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">Seriously, arguing that the typhoon is going to be better than the F-15 cuts little ice. Still have not read anything objective that remotely suggests the typhoon has a distinct advantage over the F-15SG yet (with emphasis on "distinct" and caveats on differing interpretations of what "distinct" means) or will be in the near future (even with the introduction of meteor). </span></p>

              <p>In respect of the MTCR, I think our positions differ and therefore I will leave it as that. </p>
              <p>With respect to the C-7, my purpose for highlighting it is that it is available now for the F-15SG and no typhoon user has acquired it yet ;)   </p>
              <p>As to the availability of meteor, you need to get your arguments straight. Are you claiming that the rsaf should get the typhoon with the meteor or not. Stating that the rsaf can't get the typhoon because it is in development undermines your argument that the rsaf should get the typhoon. It also undermines the claim that the rsaf can't get the AIM-120D, esp when the AIM-120D is in production. </p>
              <p>As to your claim that the developer of the meteor has stated it has a longer range than the AIM-120D, link pls. I'm not holding my breath for a response. </p>
              <p>As to your claim that they blew the budget on the amraam, we have obviously differing ways of reading the below.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong><em><span style="font-size: x-small;"><span style="color: #0000ff;">"The schedule extension increased the contract cost by approximately 10 percent, which is available with the existing program budget.”<span> </span> </span></span></em></strong></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>As to your claim that the pirate is better, I'm not holding my breath for a technical response here either. </p>
              <p>So far, I have only read that the typhoon is better because you say so. It would be nice to read some technical responses on why this is so.</p>

              <p><span style="color: #800080;">Perhaps its poor intelligence is a result of the very short gestation period that it has been through that caused it to be what it can only be in its present form.</span></p>

Then you ownself suddenly justify that it is ok that typoon did not have <em>AESA design in - later can fill it in as equipment .</em></span></p>
              <p style="margin-left: 1in;"><strong><span style="font-family: Arial; color: blue; font-size: 10pt;">Dear Storywolf, </span></strong></p>
              <p style="margin-left: 1in;"><strong><span style="font-family: Arial; color: blue; font-size: 10pt;">Again my sympathies to you as you are totally lacking in any powers of comprehension. <span> </span><span> </span></span></strong></p>
              <p style="margin-left: 1in;"><strong><span style="font-family: Arial; color: blue; font-size: 10pt;">I said earlier that<span>  </span>: -<em>“ Clearly,  one cannot accommodate a piece of equipment into the original design if it cud not be foreseen or does not exist at the time. This is obvious.”</em></span></strong></p>
              <p style="margin-left: 1in;"><strong><span style="font-family: Arial; color: blue; font-size: 10pt;">Did I say that new technologies cannot inserted later <span> </span>? <span> </span>No,<span>  </span>what I said was <span> </span>one cannot install something which was not envisaged or did not exist when the aircraft was first conceptualized or designed. <span> </span>Clearly, fighter aircraft can be upgraded with new technologies as these emerge. <span> </span></span></strong></p>
              <p style="margin-left: 1in;"><strong><span style="font-family: Arial; color: blue; font-size: 10pt;">The point is that one can perform technological<span>  </span>insertions more easily &amp; cheaper in later gen aircraft than earlier ones. <span> </span>RSAF <span> </span>A4s were continuously upgraded to the point where they were probably the most advanced A4s in the world. But there is a limit <span> </span>to what can be done to such old gen aircraft &amp; airframes. <span> </span></span></strong></p>
              <p style="margin-left: 1in;"><strong><span style="font-family: Arial; color: blue; font-size: 10pt;">New gen aircraft such as Typhoon, Rafale, SU30s for example all have canards already incorporated into the aerodynamics design. It wud be unfeasible to add these to an F15. <span> </span><span> </span></span></strong></p>
              <p style="margin-left: 1in;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">What with that Pirate is newer so must better ? is that a acceptable arguement  can have facts and figure or how better it is in range of figures ?</span></p>
              <p style="margin-left: 1in;"><strong><span style="font-family: Arial; color: blue; font-size: 10pt;">So your argument is that new technology will not be better than old <span> </span>? <span> </span>I rest my case and will not argue with you if this is your premise. <span> </span>I hope that you are still not using 1980s vintage “ brick” phones. I prefer the more recent models. </span></strong></p>
              <p style="margin-left: 1in;"><strong><span style="font-family: Arial; color: blue; font-size: 10pt;">I clearly am convinced that new technology usually surpasses the old – no confusion here. <span> </span></span></strong></p>

              <p style="margin-left: 1in;"><strong><span style="font-family: Arial; color: blue; font-size: 10pt;">Dear Weasel, </span></strong></p>
              <p style="margin-left: 1in;"><strong><span style="font-family: Arial; color: blue; font-size: 10pt;">Not only does my position, but also MTCR’s, <span> </span>differ with your position and this is positively final. </span></strong></p>
              <p style="margin-left: 1in;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">With respect to the C-7, my purpose for highlighting it is that it is available now for the F-15SG and no typhoon user has acquired it yet ;)   </span></p>
              <p style="margin-left: 1in;"><strong><span style="font-family: Arial; color: blue; font-size: 10pt;">I repeat that if Typhoon users do not possess the <span> </span>C7 , it is simply because the Typhoon community <span> </span>have neither requested nor purchased it since their existing stock of C5s are currently sufficient for their needs. </span></strong></p>
              <p style="margin-left: 1in;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">As to the availability of meteor, you need to get your arguments straight. Are you claiming that the rsaf should get the typhoon with the meteor or not. Stating that the rsaf can't get the typhoon because it is in development undermines your argument that the rsaf should get the typhoon. </span></p>
              <p style="margin-left: 1in;"><strong><span style="font-family: Arial; color: blue; font-size: 10pt;">The RSAF<span>  </span>did not want the Typhoon because it did not have the capabilties the RSAF needed in the timeframe required &amp; that’s why they chose the F 15SG – Must I repeat myself ? <span> </span>Are you hard of hearing ??</span></strong></p>
              <p style="margin-left: 1in;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">It also undermines the claim that the rsaf can't get the AIM-120D, esp when the AIM-120D is in production. </span></p>
              <p style="margin-left: 1in;"><strong><span style="font-family: Arial; color: blue; font-size: 10pt;">OK, so why has’nt the RSAF got them now ?? <span> </span>Please advise. </span></strong></p>
              <p style="margin-left: 1in;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">As to your claim that the developer of the meteor has stated it has a longer range than the AIM-120D, link pls. I'm not holding my breath for a response. </span></p>
              <p style="margin-left: 1in;"><strong><span style="font-family: Arial; color: blue; font-size: 10pt;">Sorry, but you will need to hold your breath till you turn blue. </span></strong></p>
              <p style="margin-left: 1in;"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: blue; font-size: 10pt;"><strong>In reality, <span style="text-decoration: underline;">you</span> shud show us the proof that AIM 120 D has a longer range than Meteor as <span> </span>Meteor from its onset was conceptualized to have a much longer range than the AIM 120 &amp; its variants</strong>. <span> </span>The rationale for the Meteor was that AIM 120 with its rocket propulsion did not <strong>meet the range requirements of<span>  </span>the European airforces. You mean you do not know this ?</strong></span></p>
              <p style="margin-left: 1in;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">As to your claim that they blew the budget on the amraam, we have obviously differing ways of reading the below. </span></p>
              <p style="margin-left: 1in;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;"><em><strong><span style="color: blue; font-size: 10pt;">"The schedule extension increased the contract cost by approximately 10 percent, which is available with the existing program budget.”  </span></strong></em></span></p>
              <p style="margin-left: 1in;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;"><strong>The above says it all. They exceeded the contract price by 10 %. They did not meet what was contractually agreed upon. So that means exceeded the budget - how difficult is this for you to understand ? </strong></span></p>
              <p style="margin-left: 1in;"> </p>
              <p style="margin-left: 1in;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;"> As to your claim that the pirate is better, I'm not holding my breath for a technical response here either. </span></p>
              <p style="margin-left: 1in;"><strong><span style="font-family: Arial; color: blue; font-size: 10pt;">You must be blueblack already from holding your breath that long</span></strong><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">. </span></p>
              <p style="margin-left: 1in;"><strong><span style="font-family: Arial; color: blue; font-size: 10pt;">New technology surpasses the old – I cannot stop you from not believing this to be true. <span> </span></span></strong></p>
              <p style="margin-left: 1in;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;"> </span></p>
              <p style="margin-left: 1in;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">So far, I have only read that the typhoon is better because you say so. It would be nice to read some technical responses on why this is so.</span></p>
              <p style="margin-left: 1in;"><strong><span style="font-family: Arial; color: blue; font-size: 10pt;">The <span> </span>“technical responses” are all in the open literature. </span></strong></p>
              <p style="margin-left: 1in;"><strong><span style="font-family: Arial; color: blue; font-size: 10pt;">Sorry , there is simply no excuse to feign ignorance that Typhoon is a very very good aircraft . <span> </span>But since you are clearly not a believer of new technology, I can understand why you have not come across these <span>              </span>“ responses” <span> </span>-<span>  </span>you have simply missed them. </span></strong></p>

              <p>To summarise, it take SG abt 10 years from contract signed to FOC</p>
              <p>for
               F15 SG.(2005 to 2016)</p>
              <p>But it take USA and allied minimum 15 years
               to reach IOC</p>
              <p>(2001 to 2016),not to mention FOC!</p>
              <p>u will say JSF is a 5 G fighter. Then it takes long to design n build.</p>
              <p>Well...What are the technology of JSF,2001's? 2010's?</p>
              <p>I think F15 SG is 2005's technology!!</p>

              <p>%%%%%%%%%%%%%55</p>
              <p>Is F 15 SG the right choice?</p>
              <p>There are 2 answers</p>
              <p>1.No,if SG can afford to wait for new platform to replace A4 in 2020 or even</p>
              <p>2025! If SG can wait so long, then SG can  serach for Starwar fighters,</p>
              <p>like JSF!( I assume F 15 SG FOC by 2016, if not earlier)</p>
              <p>2.Yes. SG has time frame to get the new plarform FOC.</p>
              <p>Unlike western countries, SG cannot afford to slip target dates in defense</p>
              <p>projects.</p>

              <p>u will say JSF is a 5 G fighter. Then it takes long to design n build.</p>
              <p>Well...What are the technology of JSF,2001's? 2010's?</p>
              <p>I think F15 SG is 2005's technology!!</p>
              <p>If JSF systems cannot compatible, all are rubbish!</p>
              <p>%%%%%%%%%%%%%55</p>
              <p>Is F 15 SG the right choice?</p>
              <p>There are 2 answers</p>
              <p>1.No,if SG can afford to wait for new platform to replace A4 in 2020 or even</p>
              <p>2025! If SG can wait so long, then SG can  serach for Starwar fighters,</p>
              <p>like JSF!( I assume F 15 SG FOC by 2016, if not earlier)</p>
              <p>2.Yes. SG has time frame to get the new plarform FOC.</p>
              <p>Unlike western countries, SG cannot afford to slip target dates in defense</p>
              <p>projects.</p>
              <p>@@@@@@@@@@@@2</p>
              <p>JSF is a classical example of western project--design and build simultaneously!!</p>
              <p>SG is design ,then build, Therefore,JSF delayed by 100%.</p>
              <p>JSF contract was signed in 2001, scheduled</p>
              <p>The actual first plane rolled out  in 2009 and IOC delayed to 2016!</p>

              <p><strong><em>I too  believe that the F15-SG is probably one of the best multirole aircraft today.</em></strong><strong><em>The RSAF made an extremely wise choice as the Typhoon in its current form will probably still not be as good as  the F15 SG for the role that the RSAF has planned the aircraft for. </em></strong></p>
              <p><em>I am only saying that in the future, Typhoon being a new gen aircraft has the greater potential than the F15 . </em><em>Given that the 1970s era F15 conceived originally as an air superiority fighter  still exists today as one of the best multirole aircraft today  is a great tribute to the sound design of this aircraft.  </em></p>
              <p><em>The Typhoon was also orginally conceived as an air superiority fighter &amp;  who knows,  in all probability it cud also turn out to be a great multirole aircraft in the future.  </em><em> But when Meteor becomes operational it gives Meteor equipped aircraft      such as Typhoon a major advantage in the air to air BVR scenario.   </em></p>

              <p>Yup. The main thing is not just the data flow but the software. The processor, like any computer, provides computation speed. However, if the software is meant to run on x-speed, then it becomes an issue.</p>
              <p>The processor of the APG-82 is actually derived from the APG-63(v)3 ie its not entirely new either.</p>
              <p><a href="http://www.flightglobal.com/articles/2009/06/17/328220/paris-air-show-raytheon-trumps-northrop-with-new-aesa.html">http://www.flightglobal.com/articles/2009/06/17/328220/paris-air-show-raytheon-trumps-northrop-with-new-aesa.html</a></p>
              <p>The processor's a plug in module.</p>
              <p><a href="http://www.raytheon.com/capabilities/products/stellent/groups/public/documents/content/cms04_017911.pdf"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #800080;">http://www.raytheon.com/capabilities/products/stellent/groups/public/documents/content/cms04_017911.pdf</span></span></a></p>
              <p>The point is that if the software requires, then new plug in module can be installed.</p>
              <p>The RFTF should operate in the same manner.</p>
              <p>Just a small correction, it should be using APG-63(v)1 receiver etc and not early APG-63s. Don't forget when rsaf bought the F-15SG, there wasn't the APG-63(v)4. You can only buy what's best at that point in time.</p>
              <p>Agreed, different AESAs, different capability.</p>

              <p>First prototypes of EFV was rolled out between 1995 to 2001.</p>

              <p>Production is expected 2012 to 2015!</p>
              <p>Why it take so long to roll out a vehicle?</p>
              <p>U believe it or not. SG roll out new vehicles from concepts</p>
              <p>to fielding in less than<strong> 10 years, mostly around 7 years!</strong></p>
              <p>USA and other western countries have the lexury of no-time -frame</p>
              <p>in defense projects. They can afford delay the fielding of platforms.</p>
              <p>they really dunt care for the survival and safety of their soldiers.</p>
              <p>US soldiers continue use the same platform that their <strong>granddad</strong></p>
              <p>used 40 years ago.( do u think USA upgrade can change a lot?)</p>
              <p>Who cares?</p>
              <p>again, very advanced technoloy adopted in EFV is NOT an excuse!</p>
              <p>They even no need to explain why it take so long to complete.</p>
              <p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Can SG roll out EFV much faster?</span></strong></p>

              <p>With over 14 years experieces in using amphibious Bionix,</p>
              <p>i think SG can also make EFV muxh faster.</p>
              <p>Bionix is designed , i think , for crossing rivers and not so</p>
              <p>rough sea state.</p>

              <p>than Bionix.</p>

              <p>You are here play down the achiements of SG in defense gears.</p>
              <p>It is ok. SG will not get hurt. u mean it take much longer time than SG said</p>
              <p>for completion of projects,and SG is copy cat, like SAR 21 rifle.</p>
              <p>Does TAVOR has built in sight</p>
              <p>which can reduce the burden of zeroing?</p>
              <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>SG is a smart </strong></span> <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>integrator,and not shame to admit it<br></strong></span></p>
              <p>1.i agree R n D in defense is a high risks exercises. U have to pay</p>
              <p>for lessons learnt. I think the money spent in past few decades worth</p>
              <p>every single cents. U look at this calmy then u will know why.</p>
              <p>SG is a smart  <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>integrator, i</strong></span>t can r<strong>oll out almost all small/ medium</strong></p>
              <p><strong>and important defense hard and soft wares under its name,</strong></p>
              <p><strong>except few major platforms,like sub, fighters, MBT etc.</strong></p>
              <p>u name it!</p>
              <p>From rifle, medium/ heavy machine guns, air burst grenade</p>
              <p>launcher <strong>( which country can produce air burst weapons?)</strong>.</p>
              <p><em><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>rifle cum air burst grenade launcher</strong></span></em>, to SPH,</p>
              <p>SG can integrate sub systems from many countries and roll out</p>
              <p>in much shorter time than other first world countries.</p>
              <p>Money saved is not the most imoportant. Wat matter is</p>
              <p>it show gavamna really care for defense. Defense matters!!</p>
              <p>SG is not shame to admit it import sub system. China always</p>
              <p>maintain local weapons and equipmens are 100 % home</p>
              <p>design and home made.</p>

              <p><br>Am I here to play down the achievements of SG - or am I simply puncturing your jingoistic efforts to blow hot air up your arse ?</p>
              <p>Does SG need the kind of jingoistic attempts to embarrass ourselves, or has the SAF not maintained a quiet low profile, only to raise its head at every necessary moment as a soft reminder ?</p>
              <p>Is a smart integrator equal a reflection of efficiency - when all it require is for us to absorb all the lessons learnt from others, so as to shorten our own learning curve ?</p>
              <p>While others have paid for their lessons in blood - we simply pick up the pieces and prepare ourselves for the worst without losing a drop of blood.</p>
              <p>Does that qualify your kind of jingoistic crap to demean the capabilities of other more mature military organisations whom we take lessons from ?</p>
              <p>All the bullshit you published are the "cut and paste" from publicity materials that ST has put up to polish their image and used as marketing tools.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Were you involved in the years of behind the scene ST 'private investments' in all the different programs at the experimental stage - before these were put into a package for the development of a specific program ?</p>
              <p>The Bionix was a result of the many years of experiment working with Timoney in the upgrading of the AMX SM-1 - which led to the next program to upgrade the M-113, and continuing with the ongoing program to merge some of the various features of the AMX-10 into a vehicle that suits our purpose.</p>
              <p>How close were you involved in these early experimental stages that finally got the Bionix program started as a clear mission to ST ?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Concerning the 1x telescopic sight integrated to the SAR-21 - it has received alot of cynical remarks about its real effectiveness - what are you bragging about ?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>It is better for you to read up again about the air-burst ammunition before you go about bragging about ST's air burst weapon.</p>
              <p>Try not to put the cart before the horse.</p>
              <p>This is not a product that was developed by ST - and was already around as early as in the mid-1960s - with more sophisticated versions appearing in the 1990s and developed by Oerlikons as well as Bofors.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Did you <a rel="nofollow" href="http://sgforums.com/forums/1164/topics/337783?amp%3Bpage=3">‘read your own thread dated 20 Nov 08 11.45AM’</a> ?</p>
              <p>You did print then -</p>
              <blockquote>
              <p><strong>Air-bursting grenade in rifle,SSW , &amp; GL <em>--What did SG achieve?</em></strong></p>

              <p>Almost two years later, you continue to blow hot air up your arse.</p>
