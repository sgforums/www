              <p><br>dude, its now 104-0.</p>
              <p>And yes, the F-15 as a strike plane is still rather relevant because of its flexibility and growth space. Which is really ironic, because the F-15 was never designed with strike in mind (Not a pound for air-to-ground!), but then its 2 huge-ass engines are probably a key factor.</p>
              <p>And in aerial combat, a high thrust-to-weight ratio never goes out of fashion.</p>
              <p>Considering that kill-ratio that's unmatched by any plane till now was achieved by just under 400 planes, the F-15 is the most effective fighter the world has seen to date.</p>
              <p>Of course, that it has possibly and probably been surpassed is not surprising for a design from the 1960s. But the F-15 has found a niche role as a strike plane and in this, it is still highly relevant even till today.</p>
              <p>And as the USAF has found out, it is hard to justify the purchasing of the freaking expensive F-22s when the job could have still be done by the cheaper F-15s (even though they aren't VERY cheap either).</p>

              <p>its a status symbol aircraft....F15 looks more like a scaled down  F14 tomcat.its really beautiful piece of aircraft that would be apprciated in the future due to its sleek shape.it really looks better than an F16.F15 would be in hands of wealthy aircraft collectors in time to come.</p>

              <p>The F-15SG is not outdated.  Its airframe design is "old" cos it was a 60s design.  However, it has been re-designed to accommodate a two man crew and made extensive use of modern materials.</p>
              <p>Also, the "stuffing" of the F-15SG is also brand new, and incorporates 4.5generation fighter technology.  You have new AESA radars, and faster computers for processing.  New avionics and weapons.  The F-15SG is by no means an "old" plane.</p>

              <p>The Typhoon and Rafale are extremely capable aircraft.  But I  think the F15 SG was selected because it already had a proven multirole capability and was available in the time frame specified by the RSAF. Also it was to be fitted with the AESA radar. There was also a  wide range of  effective air to ground and air to air weapons available for carriage on the F15SG</p>
              <p>I do not  think it is was a question of  "we were always going to buy the american planes.."  but rather the F15 SG was the correct choice at that point in time for a highly effective and proven <span style="text-decoration: underline;">multirole</span> aircraft. One to one  against the Typhoon or Rafale or  a SU30 , I personally think that  these aircraft  will defeat the F15 most of the time provided that the pilots are of similar quality.</p>
              <p>If  the F35 program is further delayed or becomes too expensive, I  personally wud think that  the Typhoon will be a better bet.   Within the next ten years it will have AESA , Meteor and a much more effective air to ground capability. It also has  more growth potential than the 60s era F15s.  </p>

              <p>A lot of people still quoting from old study and simulation done before Typhoon and Rafale was even build. These are not totally accurate as they are use to justify budget for building these fighters.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>If base on rumors, the lastest would be out from Dubai. F-22 vs rafale - 5 draw : 1 and rafale vs typhonn 7:1.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The F-15 actually have more advance and powerful radar, engine and other modern equipments compare wtih Typhoon or SU-30. The body design also have been totally redesign at F-15E stage.  Thus it is really a 4.5 gen equip within a 3.5 generation body. It just become more deadlier.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I  think it will more then a match even with tyhpoon or SU-30, since it have prove itself against the agile Mig-29. F-15 kill include 9 MiG-29 Fulcrums (includes one maneuver kill).</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>F-15 have the range, able to stay in air longer then the rest of planes.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Also most important - Our F-15 have all the technology to all the high tech weapon of both air-to-air and air-land already avaibable. Sadly typhoon and rafale was not chosen as they still have not resolved their capacity to carry a lot of these weapons and it is still unknow when these capacity will be available or they have fund to do it. Why wait 10 years for typhoon or rafale - AESA , Meteor and a much more effective air to ground capability - when F-15 already flying with them or something similar.</p>
              <p>F-15 is the best option for us to go. Yes typhoon and rafale may still growing but F-15 to is growning - with the slient eagle.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>With F-35 still hanging - possible the better choice would be for RSAF to go for slient eagle.</p>

            <div class='col-md body'>
              <p>In the near future , if F35 still in limbo,  RSAF  will  have  F16 ( upgraded ) and F15 SG ( or maybe Silent Eagle  )   mix.</p>
              <p>In the longer term the mix shud be F35s and I wud personally prefer Typhoons (  as they wud have matured sufficienty to exceed F15s by a big margin  ).  Typhoon also because it  is new generation aircraft , has much better growth potential , carries Meteor  &amp; probably a better range of more capable air to ground  weapons.</p>
              <p>Finally,  depending soely on USA aircraft for all RSAF fighter needs is  risky. </p>

              <p>In the near future , if F35 still in limbo,  RSAF  will  have  F16 ( upgraded ) and F15 SG ( or maybe Silent Eagle  )   mix.</p>
              <p>In the longer term the mix shud be F35s and I wud personally prefer Typhoons (  as they wud have matured sufficienty to exceed F15s by a big margin  ).  Typhoon also because it  is new generation aircraft , has much better growth potential , carries Meteor  &amp; probably a better range of more capable air to ground  weapons.</p>
              <p>Finally,  depending soely on USA aircraft for all RSAF fighter needs is  risky. </p>

              <p>i think sometime you need to let the expert reviewed the flight Data to come to that conclusion as there are factors not only from a maneuverability of the plane but also pliot experiences.</p>

              <p><br>just as its naive to believe politics play no part, it is also naive to keep thinking in that track of yours.</p>
              <p>The F-15 and Rafale were designed for different things in the very first place even though their roles now somewhat overlap. Can't you see that? The F-15 is a significantly larger plane with superior range, space for additional equipment, larger payload. The F-15 was never meant to be a multi-role plane although it was found that its 2 huge engines and its size made it suitable as one in the form of the Strike Eagle.</p>
              <p>When you consider that the F-15 shares the same engines as the F-16, and when you consider its range and payload, of course it makes more sense to purchase the F-15. Both were meant to complement each other in any case.</p>

              <p>Typhoon have IRST, F15Sg also have tiger eye IRST.</p>
              <p>F-15sg already have AESA <em><strong>radar - current Typhoon ?</strong></em></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>payload ? Range ? - Can Typhoon even come close - please tell me there is no major technical barriers .</p>
