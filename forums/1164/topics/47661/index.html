            <div class='col-md body'>Italy Takes Delivery of First F-16<br>Aviation Week &amp; Space Technology<br>06/02/2003, page 31<br><br>Andy Nativi<br>Genoa<br><br>Falcon Heads for Italy<br><br>The Italian air force will take delivery this month of the first of 34 F-16 aircraft it is leasing to provide an interim air defense platform. Four additional airframes will be used to generate spare parts.<br><br>Under the Peace Caesar program, the Italian air force will operate the 34 fighters for up to 10 years, using a pay-by-the-hour arrangement. The U.S. Air Force and Lockheed Martin will provide maintenance and training services. The ongoing program covers an initial five-year period with an option for a five-year extension.<br><br>Prior to delivery, the F-16s are undergoing an airframe service-life extension and an engine upgrade, plus minor modifications.<br><br>Initially they will be assigned to the 18th fighter squadron of the 37th wing, based in Trapani, Sicily, which will serve as the main operating base. The squadron now flies F-104 ASAM fighters. The second squadron to transition to the F-16 will be the 23rd squadron of the 5th wing, in Cervia. As many as 100 pilots, instructor pilots, maintenance officers and technicians are completing their training in the U.S.<br><br>With the delivery of the F-16s, the Italian air force is rapidly retiring its old F104 ASAMs; the last wing to fly the type will be the 9th wing, in Grazzanise. The type will be withdrawn from service by the end of 2004. Aircraft will be retired as they reach their next major inspection point, and only viable airframes will be retained.<br><br>The service is also reducing its force of Tornado F3 fighters, leased from the U.K. They are gradually being returned to the RAF from the 36th wing, based in Gioia del Colle. The air force also expects to receive its first Eurofighter Typhoon in June, with the 4th wing in Grosseto equipping a first operational conversion unit to be followed by an operational fighter squadron.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE<br>July 17, 2003<br><br>Lockheed Martin, U.S., Italian Officials Celebrate F-16 Â‘Peace CaesarÂ’ Delivery<br>Fort Worth, Texas Â— Lockheed Martin [NYSE: LMT] officials, along with officers from the United States and Italian Air Forces, celebrated the delivery today of the first of 34 F-16 fighter jets to be provided to Italy under a program known as Peace Caesar. The ceremony took place at Trapani Air Base, Italy.<br><br>Â“We are proud to stand side-by-side today with our Italian partners to accept delivery of this remarkable jet aircraft,Â” said John Bean, vice president of Lockheed MartinÂ’s F-16 program. Â“The Peace Caesar program not only increases ItalyÂ’s national defense capabilities, it enhances the relationship between Lockheed Martin and the Italian government. It is a growing friendship strengthened by international cooperation and partnerships that date back to the 1960s.Â”<br><br>The Italian Air Force chose the leased F-16 option as the most cost-effective solution to replace its aging fleet of Tornado and F-104 fighters.

More than 4,000 aircraft have been delivered, hundreds more are on order, and production is expected to continue beyond 2010. Major upgrades for all F-16 versions are being incorporated to keep the fleet modern and fully supportable over the aircraftÂ’s long service life.<br><br>Lockheed Martin Aeronautics Co., a business area of Lockheed Martin, is a leader in the design, development, systems integration, production and support of advanced military aircraft and related technologies.
