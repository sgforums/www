            <div class='col-md body'>It is just like Nokia handphone... when the model is new and just launch. The stupid shops tried to rip us off by telling cock and bull story. Trying their best effort to convince you to pay through your nose. Same thing happen to the F22, see the USAF signed on the dotted line to make comittement to purchase the F22. But after signing the documents, the USAF shound that F22 cannot do ground attack mission, worst of all, the unit price of the F22 just ballooned skyhigh like the SGX stock price index...<br><br>Now the USAF is trying to get another super plane into service by filling the gap of the F22. Chances are they will get the modified F23 back to action due to few considerations:<br><br>1) never put all your eggs in a single baskets; do not rely on a single supplier for all your needs else you will be at their mercy in the critical time<br><br>2) competition in free market will bring out the best products at the most affordable price to the market consumers.<br><br>3) create more employment in the aircraft industries.<br><br>4) JSF F35 overall performance enevlope would be very similar to EuroFighter and later variants of Rafale. The only clear advance for F35 lies on the VSTOL capabilities that is absent on all other Gen 4 fighters.<br><br>5) USAF would expect more capable and expendable UCAV to enter into services sometimes later in late 2010s. The introduction of UCAV would revolutionise the way and dimensions of the air warfare. Much cheaper yet more deadly, very production friendly as u build in large quantities.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I thot the F22 and F35 are a hi-low mix like the current F15/F16 combi....<br><br>The F22 is the superlative fighter above all else and the F16 is procured at larger numbers for numerical effects. and to fill up force levels.<br><br>As for F15 remember at one time ONLY the US (rich), Japan (rich), Saudi Arabia (Oil rich) and Iseral (American Aid and national survial) can afford to operate the F15, now Korea and us are operating it.<br><br>The thing about the F22 is that it doesn't have the adversary....</div>

Left over money will upgrade the weapon system from ASTER-15 to PAAMS (both aster-15 and -30), Harpoon Block II or even Tomahawk. While raptor shoot with AIM-120, I shoot it with PAAMS, ground attack I use Harpoon.<br><br>A ship's endurance and range is much further than plane, giving it more punch. Thus I come to this decision. Anyony care to give any comments. Good comment please...</div></blockquote>Emmm, don't forget F22 can shoot deadly HARM anti-radiation missile(ARM)!<br><br>Usually the X-band air desfense radar's track range of a F16 size plane is 100Km+, the RCS of F16 is about 5m2, the RCS of F22 is said to be below 0.01m2, that works out the radar only can track the f22 at a very short distance, so short, u'd better use ur bare eyes to find it!<br><br>However, the F22's passive sensor can detect ur radar emission at a very long distance, and just shoot the harm ARM towards the emission source at a comfortable distance both for the F22 and HARM. When the harm travels at a high speed of 3 Mach, you know everything is too late. If the radar down, your airdefense down, now u r no different from a sampan in front of a anti-ship missile</div>
