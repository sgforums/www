            <div class='col-md body'>Correction for my mistake that <strong>F-35 is strictly a carrier-based. It needs catapult for it to launch and there is no way of launching the C-version off from a LPD (at least from current LPD design). </strong> It should be <strong>F-35C</strong> is strictly a carrier-based.<br><br><blockquote>Originally posted by LazerLordz:<br>Correct.The C should be a V/STOL version which is for the Marines and the Carrier.Not the usual catapult launch version.</blockquote>F-35C is entirely designed for <strong>US Navy</strong>. To takeoff from carrier, it definitely must be catapult off. That's why they call it Very Short takeoff/landing.<br>F-35B is then for <strong>USMC, RN, </strong>designed for STOVL using ramps which is seen on Invincible-class carrier. As why Wasp-class assault ship don't have ramp is that its flight deck is so long that it does not need the ramp to launch the aircraft.<br><br><strong>USN - Multi-role, stealthy strike fighter to complement F/A-18E/F. Carrier operations account for most of the differences between the Navy version and the other JSF variants. The aircraft has larger wing and tail control surfaces to better manage low-speed approaches. The internal structure of the Navy variant is strengthened up to handle the loads associated with catapult launches and arrested landings. The aircraft has a carrier-suitable tailhook. Its landing gear has a longer stroke and higher load capacity. The aircraft has almost twice the range of an F-18C on internal fuel. The design is also optimized for survivability. </strong><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>The air superioirity in the future belongs to the effective use of UCAV and Manned Fighters (VSTOL). I believe that Sg will use F15 as a stepping stones for training our pilot in deep strike operations.<br><br>Buying the F35 B or C make sense to us. Why?<br>1. As technologies improved, u can reduce the number of hardware to achieve the mission objective. Thus, it off-set the cost factor from the equation.<br><br>2. VSTOL aircraft enable our planes to strike out deeper and further with heavier load. The LSD ships could operate as a make shift refuelling station during the mission.<br><br>3. VSTOL enable us to throw away the idea of long runway. Thus, it will greatly increase our operational flexibility in time of war. Just note that our neighbour Sukkoi needs a 1km runway to take off with full weapon load.<br><br>4. Lessons from Falkland war has illustrated the usefulness of the Harriers. They are able to operate in the front line from refuelling and re-arming. Thus, shorten the mission time, and increase the leathality due to shorter time lag.<br><br>I believe that the future 3G airforce will include a combination usage of advanced manned fighter (F15 / F35) together with UCAV for enemies air defence suspession. Due to the large weapon load on F15 and F35, together with the adv sesnory systems and guided weaponaries, we would be able to deliver good punch at a very reasonable cost, yet without compromising our operation flexibility.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><br>Also we will maybe not buy F/A-22 due to the very very high cost of the Raptor. Like what LazerLordz had say, even UK's not getting them. A report I'd read says that in Asia, only Japan can afford to buy those planes, but at a limited quantity. So I dun think Singapore will be buying the raptor, though I personally will want to see it with the lion head on it. Unless the Singapore dollar is going so strong that US$1 = S$1...

Considering USAF's firm order only stands for 178 units of F22, The development cost per unit alone will be sth like 100 million bucks over. the manufacturing cost said to be below 200 millions USD per unit. the 2 costs add together, then you see the F22's price is skyhigh--near 300 million USD!!<br><br></div>

Left over money will upgrade the weapon system from ASTER-15 to PAAMS (both aster-15 and -30), Harpoon Block II or even Tomahawk. While raptor shoot with AIM-120, I shoot it with PAAMS, ground attack I use Harpoon.<br><br>A ship's endurance and range is much further than plane, giving it more punch. Thus I come to this decision. Anyony care to give any comments. Good comment please...</div>

Their aviation industry's economy in scale and expertise make their products low in manufacturing cost but high in quality even compared to those in Russian and china. While 1 US engine plant can turn out hundreds of F110 powerplants per year , it may take years for a Chinese engine plant to do the same volume, so, you know, no matter how cheap the labor cost in china, it still lost the manufacturing cost because you prolong your production too much.<br><br>BTW, many sub-systems of F22 are naturally in high cost compared to older Generation fighter jets. I would see: the American strong aviation industry saves the cost for F22 but the naturally high materials cost specially those stealth materials, composites, rare alloys used in the F119 powerplant, T/R module used in the APG77 AESA. which all cost u dearly</div>
