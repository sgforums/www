            <div class='col-md body'>As you all would have already known,  Singapore is in the JSF programme as a Security Cooperative Participant. It is an open secret that the RSAF is looking to the F-35 to fill its needs in the years to come.<br><br>The F-35 itself is a very capable aircraft, and comes in 3 versions (so far), the conventional take-off and landing (CTOL) F-35A, the Advanced Short Take-Off Vertical Landing (ASTOVL) F-35B, and the carrier-based (CV) F-35C.<br><br>The USAF and RAF are ordering mainly the F-35A, the USMC and RN are ordering the F-35B, and the USN, the F-35C<br><br>The USAF is considering the F-35B. The Royal Navy is considering ordering the F-35C variant for its large CVF Future Carrier program.<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">One important development has been the emergence of the USAF requirement for the F-35B. The STOVL variant had been viewed as the most likely victim of cost-cutting measures, however the USAF commitment seems to guarantee the aircraft that the USMC, RN, and RAF need. It is understood that the US military's experience in Afghanistan has highlighted the importance of more flexible assets in the close air support role.<br><br>USAF has elected to buy three wings (representing 216 examples) of the F-35B, as a result. For a time, it appeared that the USAF variant of the F-35B would contain enough changes to constitute a new variant. Changes were to include differences in the propulsion system to increase emphasis on STOL capability over that of VTOL, a larger wing to allow more fuel, an interior cannon (as opposed to the USMC external gun pod), or changes to the in-flight refuelling system. However, due to opposition from people involved with the program, the USAF version will be essentially identical to the USMC/RN F-35B specification.<br><br>-wiki</span><br><br>my question is, what variants (and possible numbers) of the F-35 do you think the RSAF will procure? Of course the F-35C would be out of the question, unless the RSN suddenly decides to get a CV. Would we get mostly F-35As? or mostly As and some Bs or the other way round? supposedly the F-35Bs, due to measures taken to reduce weight, has made the the internal bay unable to carry Mk-84 sized weapons.<br><br>Discuss away =)</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I personally think that with the buying of F-15T, our F-5 fighter will also be replace by the F-15T. It is clear that the procurement will not stop at 8 - 10 aircraft. There are reports that RSAF is trimming down the fighter type from 3 to 2. Replacing the F-5 is the next important task and they are coming to another end of their lifespan as their previous upgrade will only last them 10 years. And also I doubt the F-35 will be released for sale to us that early, probably not till 2020, considering we are only participating as a partner, not investor. My bet is that in the future 2 squadron of 20 F-15T each (air superiority, etc) and 3 squadron of 20 F-35A each (ground attack, SEAD, etc). If we buy F-35B, then something must be on the mind of defence ministry thinking. Maybe not of a carrier but an amphibious assault ship like the Wasp-class vessel. Currently to ferry 1 battalion of Guards to fight using helicopter from our LSTs is not quite possible. A likely scenario is that the AAS will carry the Guards together with helicopters to fight while F-35B provide the necessary air cover.</div>

Also there are just so many of them. 50+ and some in Recce role also.<br><br>I think we will at least get 20+ F15s eventually. as it would make more economic sense to operate...<br><br>Even if the F5s are to be slowly replaced by the F15, it will be in phases. probbaly the first generation of F5 can be replaced as they hit their end of life airtime....<br><br>Also judging from the practice of the F16, it will be years before the RSAF ferry the F15 back from the states..... so the F5 will still need to man the fort in sgp.<br><br></div>

Moreover the F-35 is not regarded a high end fighter like the F/A-22 so I feel that we will definitely acquire some from 2014 onwards, keeping in mind that the F-15T is meant as an A-4SU replacement and not a F-5S/T replacement.<br><br>Even acquiring a fleet of 40 F-15T will just about be sufficient to replace the now withdrawn fleet of 82 A-4SU Skyhawks. Expecting the 40 new planes to also cover the duties of 53 F-5S/T would be stretching them a little too much won't it? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_question.gif" alt="Question" title="Question">  i.e Replacing 135 warplanes with only 40 new ones? This would result in a sharp fall in the critical numbers required for us to maintain a truly effective fighting force.</div>

Its purpose was to replace the current generation of strike fighters, such as the harrier, the A-10 Thunderbolt II, F/A-18 Hornet and the F-16 Fighting Falcon. It also has air to air capability, and it can carry ordnance externally, which i think the F-22 cannot.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote>Originally posted by LazerLordz<br>Don't forget our Blk52+ can still be the legacy squadron for SEAD too.And noting that ST Marine has actually a much larger LPD on plans which was currently turned down by MINDEF, it comes down to the B and C config.I wouldn't dismiss the C anytime soon.The SAF is transforming quite fast comparatively and the only natural progression from frigate and submarine operations is some form of naval air element.<br></blockquote>I agree that SAF is slowly progressing and naval air element is another area that we got to improve. F-35 is strictly a carrier-based. It needs catapult for it to launch and there is no way of launching the C-version off from a LPD (at least from current LPD design). Former Chief of Navy Liu (forget his name...) had stated before that given SAF's limited personnel, Singapore will not operate CV in the near future (unless ST Marine comes up with a crew-saving design). So F-35C is out.<br><br><blockquote>Originally posted by Delta 5<br>But there will be a shortfall definitely from 2014 onwards as our F-5S/T fleet is retired. Moreover the F-35 is not regarded a high end fighter like the F/A-22 so I feel that we will definitely acquire some from 2014 onwards, keeping in mind that the F-15T is meant as an A-4SU replacement and not a F-5S/T replacement.<br><br>Even acquiring a fleet of 40 F-15T will just about be sufficient to replace the now withdrawn fleet of 82 A-4SU Skyhawks. Expecting the 40 new planes to also cover the duties of 53 F-5S/T would be stretching them a little too much won't it?  i.e <strong>Replacing 135 warplanes with only 40 new ones?</strong> This would result in a sharp fall in the critical numbers required for us to maintain a truly effective fighting force.<br></blockquote>The F-5S upgrading first took place in 1994. If I'm not wrong the first upgraded squadron flies in 1999. Official reports have stated that the upgrade will extend their lifeline by 10 to 15 years. Lets say 2015 is the final deadline, the F-15T will have attended training in US for 5 years (delivery date believed to be 2008 - 2010). So it's time to bring the 1st batch back. Eventual procurement will be about 40. W must not forget that RSAF bought 20 F-16C/D Blk52+ just to replace the A-4SU, and also remaining F-16C/D blk 52 in our orbat. So the F-16 and 20 F-15 will replace the 80 A-4SU given the superior capability of the 2 over the skyhawks. The other 20 F-15T will replace the oldest F-5 first. Rest of the F-5 and shortfall of capability after retirement of A-4SU and also eventual early retirement or gift to friendly countries of our F-16s will eventually be replaced by the new F-35A/B in maybe 2020. 5 squadrons of 20 each is 100 planes not 40. These 100 more capable new birds will replace 135 old birds. Why not? I agree that there will definitely be shortfall in capability. But thats part and parcel.<br><br>Also we will maybe not buy F/A-22 due to the very very high cost of the Raptor. Like what LazerLordz had say, even UK's not getting them. A report I'd read says that in Asia, only Japan can afford to buy those planes, but at a limited quantity. So I dun think Singapore will be buying the raptor, though I personally will want to see it with the lion head on it. Unless the Singapore dollar is going so strong that US$1 = S$1... Comments?</div>
