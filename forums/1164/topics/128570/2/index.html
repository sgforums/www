            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote>Originally posted by Marco_Simone:<br><strong>[b]It's 4:41AM.<br><br>The Malaysian political and military leadership were paralysed in the first 41 minutes of the unexpected attack by Singapore. Their intelligence had failed them. They had earlier dismissed the silent mobilisation of Singapore Armed Forces as nothing more than the usual mobilisation practice culminating in a military exercise which the island regularly conducted and which been earlier announced in the Singapore press.<br><br>In the panic and ensuing confusion, the PM decided to invoke the Malaysian-Indonesian Alliance, where an attack on Malaysia would be deemed to be an attack on Indonesia. However, his Defence Chief, as cool, calm and collected as ever, assured him that it would not be necessary. He said that the MAF would respond with a vengeance - in spite of 90% of their Air Force having been destroyed - that would lead to the total and complete destruction of Singapore.<br><br>The MLRS missile batteries hidden in the hardened bunkers in the hills of Johore were activated. Within 15 minutes, 250 missiles were launched in the first wave of attack and were sent streaking into the air and across the Johore Straits. 152 missiles malfunctioned and exploded in mid-air. The MAF had a notorious record of maintaining their military hardware. However, 98 missiles found their targets.<br><br>The Ministry of Defence's nerve centre in Bukit Gombak partially collapsed with the onslaught of the first wave of a missile barrage, hindering the Singapore Armed Forces' command, control and communication structure. The military command centres in the airforce bases in Lim Chu Kang, Sembawang and Paya Lebar were hit. Runaways were destroyed. Roads serving as alternative runaways were destroyed. Missiles also rained on the civil-military supply bases. Changi airport was partially destroyed, trapping thousands of Singaporeans and foreigners who had gathered to try to flee the island state. 15 missiles struck the Central Business District, partially destroying buildings.<br><br>Twelve stray missiles struck the HDB towns of Woodlands, Yishun, Choa Chu Kang, Jurong West, Tampines, Pasir Ris and the middle class suburb of Bukit Timah. 6,819 Singaporeans were killed within the first 20 minutes of the missile strikes. 16,732 were injured. The Singapore hospitals could not cope with the continuing stream of ambulances and makeshift ambulances ferrying in the bloodied wounded. Dead bodies were left outside the hospitals' mortuaries when it became obvious that the mortuaries did not have the capacity to cope with the constant flow of vehicles streaming in to send yet another ghastly load of dead people, many of whom had heads and limbs torn off from their mangled and bloodied torsos.<br><br>Within 40 minutes of the missile barrage and before the Malaysians could launch a second missile wave, the Singapore Government - commanding the battle from the comfort and safety of a faraway land - acted upon the advice of their trembling, nervous defence chief, a sallowed skin, portly, bespectacled scholar who, at age 39, was the world's youngest Chief of Defence Force.<br><br>The Malaysian Defence Chief smiled. Singapore had unconditionally surrendered to the Malaysians. He called his Prime Minister and reminded him of what the Malaysian Defence Chiefs had been advising the political leadership many times in the past; that there was never a need to match Singapore with glamorous but expensive fighter jets and fanciful military hardware. All the MAF needed were to invest in multiple launched rocket missiles - obtained cheaply at a tiny fraction of the cost of Singapore's advanced fighter jets - to bring Singapore to its knees.<br><br>The Singaporeans earned a consolation price. They achieved a world's first and was recorded in the Guinness book of record for fighting the shortest war of aggression, all of 1 hour 49 minutes.<br><br>Three months later, history repeated itself. Singapore was reabsorbed into Malaysia as a Malaysian state.</strong><br><br>What do you guys think of this scenario?[/b]</blockquote>Err........you forgotten to mention that a few rounds of the MLRS hit and sink USS Nimitz which is anchoring in CNB. USA declared war with MAT and destroy MAT with a single nuke. MAT surrenders. SAF troops march into KL. And me - Manager433 goes around farking MAT chio bu that I can find.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>FIrst of all, it's an inept, unrealistic and overly simplistic scenario.<br><br>It's like - RSAF attacks, MAF does nothing. MAF hits back with rockets, SAF does nothing.<br><br>It's like those HK kungfu films where even though 10 people are attacking Jackie Chan, they take turns one by one to strike at him instead of rushing him all at once from all direction and rendering his defensive kungfu useless.<br><br>First of all, MAF is not so dumb as to go to sleep when SG mobilises all its units. They are just not as laid back as you think.<br><br>If SG launches an attack at Malaysia, why would we just launch an air attack and then just sit back and wait for them to retaliate?<br><br>Why wouldn't our 300,000 troops and our 350 little AMX-13's not swarm across the causeway into Johore?<br><br>While it is true that the rockets are something to worry about, the civvi population is not gonnna sit around in their HDB flats watching tele with a war going on. If SG started the war - which is sily to begin with - it would have made preparations for its population to be moved into underground shelters and MRT stations in the event of reprisals. So your civvi casualty figures are way too high.<br><br>Why do you think all our new HDB flats have bomb shelters?<br><br>And since these rockets, being inherently inaccurate, cannot destroy our military infrastructure, we will be well into launching our next phase of the invasion - whatever in your scenario that should be.<br><br>But if SG ever invades Malaysia, we can never hope to win. We simply do not have enough men and equipment to invade and hold that country, it's just too big and there's too few of us.<br><br>It'll be like US invading Iraq: easy to get in, costly to hold and harder to get out. We can only achieve limited objectives and quickly pull out and negotiate for peace. If we stay in Johore too long we stand a good chance of being cut off and clobbered. Remember, no matter how many of their planes, tanks, etc we destroy, these attacks will not completely destroy their infantry. And in the end jungle fighting is an infantry war. And MAF infantry units are very good jungle fighters.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Ladies and gentlemen,<br><br>Artillery is a very sensitive issue. I hope you guys remember that on a particular day in 1999, almost every single unit in SAF are mobilised because Malaysian artillery had moved close to Johor and no malaysian authority informed us that there will be an exercise.<br><br>It is totally out of a question that singapore will not take out the MRLS on our first strike.<br><br>My uncle was an F-16 strike pilot. That day he remembered the country almost went to war, as he sat in the briefing room waiting for orders to strike. He was already designated targets in Malaysia. He told me that some of his friends were given the task of destroying Malaysian artillery, but no MRLS were in service yet.<br><br>Malaysia dare not take the chance of installing artillery near Johor. They know the risk. Even their main Air force base is in Penang, butterworth.  They themselves dare not take the risk and put their precious Migs and Hornets far away from us.</div>

The APS-145 detective range is only got sth to do with the RCS and the speed of the target. Just as u mentioned, the rocket actual size is comparable to that of MRAAM. A common MRAAM RCS is 0.1-0.2 m2, but a F15 size plane is 10-15m2. So the E2 can track the 10-15m2 RCS target in 200kms but much short for it to track sub-1m2 target. Considering  the E-2 has to track so many targets in the sky and sea and land at same time, how it can realize in time, the rockets r not AAM towards itself or sth else?  On the other hand, the rocket flies at such high speed, it takes only a few minutes to cover its 90km range. Do u think the E2 tracking practice is not a joke in reality?<br><br>When we watching Hollywood war movies like Topgun/ Behind the enemy line or so, usually, the fighter jet pilot realize the AAM only by their alarm, but not via their onboard radar.<br></strong><br></div>

In a pre-emptive attack by Singapore, KL, PJ, SS2, Puchong, Shah Alam and Subang would have been obliterated, killing far more than the Singaporean count in the scenario. The Malaysian leaders would definetely think twice before trying to fire their rockets less they lose another major population centre.<br><br>And I think Singapore is too proud to surrender so fast - not to Malaysia anyway. If all of Singapore's reserve escape into hiding in Malaysia's jungles, Malaysia will have a serious problem on its hands. At least 300,000 very angry soldiers and ex-soldiers hiding in the midst of their botanical labyrinths. Most of them not caring if they live or die, they have lost their tiny utopian state and families, and they want a blood vengeance. Most of these are highly-educated, thinking and strategizing soldiers equipped with scoped rifles, NVGs, anti-tank weapons, grenade launchers, machine guns, claymore mines and mortars. Good luck to the MAF in weeding them out. And I haven't even started talking about SAF's armour and artillery (which from what I know, can hit KL from Singapore).<br><br>In the first place, you two countries should never ever fight. Too much to lose from each other. Billateral trade between Singapore and Malaysia amounted to SG$77.2 billion in 2003, probably even higher now. Why risk losing such a pot of gold over petty arguments? Due to the geographical proximity, the two neighbours will be devastated by war - physically, psychologically and economically.
