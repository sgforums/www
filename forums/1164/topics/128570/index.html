            <div class='col-md body'><strong>It's 4:41AM.<br><br>The Malaysian political and military leadership were paralysed in the first 41 minutes of the unexpected attack by Singapore. Their intelligence had failed them. They had earlier dismissed the silent mobilisation of Singapore Armed Forces as nothing more than the usual mobilisation practice culminating in a military exercise which the island regularly conducted and which been earlier announced in the Singapore press.<br><br>In the panic and ensuing confusion, the PM decided to invoke the Malaysian-Indonesian Alliance, where an attack on Malaysia would be deemed to be an attack on Indonesia. However, his Defence Chief, as cool, calm and collected as ever, assured him that it would not be necessary. He said that the MAF would respond with a vengeance - in spite of 90% of their Air Force having been destroyed - that would lead to the total and complete destruction of Singapore.<br><br>The MLRS missile batteries hidden in the hardened bunkers in the hills of Johore were activated. Within 15 minutes, 250 missiles were launched in the first wave of attack and were sent streaking into the air and across the Johore Straits. 152 missiles malfunctioned and exploded in mid-air. The MAF had a notorious record of maintaining their military hardware. However, 98 missiles found their targets.<br><br>The Ministry of Defence's nerve centre in Bukit Gombak partially collapsed with the onslaught of the first wave of a missile barrage, hindering the Singapore Armed Forces' command, control and communication structure. The military command centres in the airforce bases in Lim Chu Kang, Sembawang and Paya Lebar were hit. Runaways were destroyed. Roads serving as alternative runaways were destroyed. Missiles also rained on the civil-military supply bases. Changi airport was partially destroyed, trapping thousands of Singaporeans and foreigners who had gathered to try to flee the island state. 15 missiles struck the Central Business District, partially destroying buildings.<br><br>Twelve stray missiles struck the HDB towns of Woodlands, Yishun, Choa Chu Kang, Jurong West, Tampines, Pasir Ris and the middle class suburb of Bukit Timah. 6,819 Singaporeans were killed within the first 20 minutes of the missile strikes. 16,732 were injured. The Singapore hospitals could not cope with the continuing stream of ambulances and makeshift ambulances ferrying in the bloodied wounded. Dead bodies were left outside the hospitals' mortuaries when it became obvious that the mortuaries did not have the capacity to cope with the constant flow of vehicles streaming in to send yet another ghastly load of dead people, many of whom had heads and limbs torn off from their mangled and bloodied torsos.<br><br>Within 40 minutes of the missile barrage and before the Malaysians could launch a second missile wave, the Singapore Government - commanding the battle from the comfort and safety of a faraway land - acted upon the advice of their trembling, nervous defence chief, a sallowed skin, portly, bespectacled scholar who, at age 39, was the world's youngest Chief of Defence Force.<br><br>The Malaysian Defence Chief smiled. Singapore had unconditionally surrendered to the Malaysians. He called his Prime Minister and reminded him of what the Malaysian Defence Chiefs had been advising the political leadership many times in the past; that there was never a need to match Singapore with glamorous but expensive fighter jets and fanciful military hardware. All the MAF needed were to invest in multiple launched rocket missiles - obtained cheaply at a tiny fraction of the cost of Singapore's advanced fighter jets - to bring Singapore to its knees.<br><br>The Singaporeans earned a consolation price. They achieved a world's first and was recorded in the Guinness book of record for fighting the shortest war of aggression, all of 1 hour 49 minutes.<br><br>Three months later, history repeated itself. Singapore was reabsorbed into Malaysia as a Malaysian state.</strong><br><br>What do you guys think of this scenario?</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>In all fairness, I think the scenario is quite exciting, albeit simplistic. In a pre-emptive attack by Singapore, KL, PJ, SS2, Puchong, Shah Alam and Subang would have been obliterated, killing far more than the Singaporean count in the scenario. The Malaysian leaders would definetely think twice before trying to fire their rockets less they lose another major population centre.<br><br>And I think Singapore is too proud to surrender so fast - not to Malaysia anyway. If all of Singapore's reserve escape into hiding in Malaysia's jungles, Malaysia will have a serious problem on its hands. At least 300,000 very angry soldiers and ex-soldiers hiding in the midst of their botanical labyrinths. Most of them not caring if they live or die, they have lost their tiny utopian state and families, and they want a blood vengeance. Most of these are highly-educated, thinking and strategizing soldiers equipped with scoped rifles, NVGs, anti-tank weapons, grenade launchers, machine guns, claymore mines and mortars. Good luck to the MAF in weeding them out. And I haven't even started talking about SAF's armour and artillery (which from what I know, can hit KL from Singapore).<br><br>In the first place, you two countries should never ever fight. Too much to lose from each other. Billateral trade between Singapore and Malaysia amounted to SG$77.2 billion in 2003, probably even higher now. Why risk losing such a pot of gold over petty arguments? Due to the geographical proximity, the two neighbours will be devastated by war - physically, psychologically and economically. Millions will die.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>oh... come to think of it... since the range of the astros is so pathetic at 90km... i think its well within the radar detection range of the F-16, so even if the E-2 is not on station.... the F-16 alone should be more then enough to silence those overpriced rockets.</div>

If u aware this enough, u would know what the Malaysian army currently doing now, they are not too much to just hug new fighter, but they sliently upgrading their SAM-Surface To Air Missile. to the defending side, the SAM is cheaper but much more effect means to counter air strick.
