No you will not because if they got nabbed, you better be far away.<br><br>Don't say these civilians don't know or ignorant because this is not a sudden raid, prior to this iraq war and during it, they dropped pampflets and it was broadcast on every news network in the world even in iraq and fighting has been going on for months in that area. Even a three year old will know enough to avoid the area.<br><br>In most fighting there are always bystanders around, anybody who doesn't want to get involved should leave or disperse, this is a natural instinct. Anybody who stays is a combatant and is fair game.<br><br>I seriously doubt that this is considered war crime, any media whenever they get hold of such things always play it to the max.<br><br>Don't always believe everything you hear.<br><br></div>
