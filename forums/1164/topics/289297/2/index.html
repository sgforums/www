Ya... maybe I will be CHARGED until JIALAT JIALAT by the enemy for HELPING them DEFEATING SAF... anyways I wouldn't be sticking ard when the war ends or even b4 the war begins which I think might anytime soon given S'pore's foreign policies when situated in mostly muslim region<br><br><strong>Your exp at ATAC suck !!! - and you never use brain.<br><br>Not asking you engage a damn company or platoon ... just look for small group of soldiers ... There is alway some idiot that wonder out to pee ... or to do something funny .... there is alway someone that drop behind..<br><br>You just have to plan where you ambush - a section size - the most ... with thick veg all over. Space out the shooting, when they look other side shoot, they will never find you, by the time you drop the 3rd guy, they will run like mad and leaving behind their fallen friends for you to pick !!! </strong><br><br>Ya maybe my exp at ATAC suck... maybe u have not seen a combat driver during ATAC but usually we ferry the combatants to the frontline and we when they r out there SEARCHING for the enemy... we r ORDER to STAY at the extraction pt and WAIT (sitting ducks)... dunno why the enemy recce always coms their HQ our location when the combatants who should be ones protecting us r out there... I tried to pick a spot a distance away from the vehicles among the foilage but kena suan by my sergeant 'HOW TO PROTECT YOUR VEHICLE FROM THERE'... in the end the whole section were positioned in a trench in front of the vehicle... when the enemies comes... a grenade flew into the trench and the umpire whistle... the whole section was KIA on the second day... spent another few days waiting in the main camp... imagine getting killed b'cos u follow the orders of some son of a b*t*h... life is too precious to be lost at another's folly   [/b]</blockquote>Should u even be talking abt wat u saw in the course of u'r NS experience? And I don't think u've seen enuff to call the SAF a cowardly army;none of us had for the matter.In any case, famed armies since Hannibal's had advocated attack as the best form of defence;what makes u think that ours is any different? Besides,depending on the circumstances,being in a trench when you're in a fixed defensive position would actually make some sense, isn't it?<br><br>Edited for missing out on a word.</div>

You should have shot them yourself.<br><br>First you ferry combatants to the frontline ... if it is the damn front line, you are suppose to drop them and get the hell out of there, back to a more secured area to wait for call to pick them up again !!! You do not move into extraction point till destinated time or called.<br><br>For all my combat drivers - my theory to them is alway vehicle is your asset ! Without it = what the use of  driver ! If i want the place to be defended - i would have left protection party !  The best way to protect vehicles is first sign of trouble jump on it and get it hell out of there.  Whole section in front of in a foxhole is not the smart way ! The better way is to station people out  to some foilage so to detect enemy, first sign of them - got all the vehicle out ..... !!! Take the vehicle and run - that the best protection... fight only when you have no choice.<br><br>Your sergent should be shot ! I agree there is some idiots commander out there who are nuts and not practical !<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Heliakaon if you consider the SAF to be a lau lan and farked up Army, by all means keep that yourself. I'm not suppressing your freedom of speech,by all means go ahead. But let me remind you, our young men serve for a purpose. 2yrs of our lives are not for nothing, for when the time comes for us to bear arms and stand firm to show our resolve, I have no doubt that many of us will.<br><br>Not because we are protecting the govt.,we will not be fighting as soldiers but as citizens protecting what's ours. We are not fighting simply for the material gain of ground, but we are fighting for our families, friends,values, believes and way of life. I'm not asking you to defend the govt. , I'm simply asking you to take responsibility as a citizen to protect what is yours.  Call me an idealist, but in this country, where almost everything is controlled, the only free thing left to protect is our ideas. If you wish to be a turn coat, I won't call you a coward, I believe you are entitled to your believes, and you can choose whatever choices you wish to make. However, would you want to live a life where there's nothing you value? When during times of difficulty, you do not stand firm on your own believes and simply cross over to the simpler or winning side?Whats the point of living then I ask you?<br><br>Trust me, what you encountered in ATEC, is not the best representation of actual warfare. Its a "carefully" scripted list of events thats supposed to happen according to the timeline. And that 3SG that told you to form up with the rest...is doing what's "SOP". Also, from what you elaborated, it doesn't make tactical sense to me for you to get out of the vehicle and to dig a foxhole, fire trench. You should simply stay in your vehicle, at the first sign of trouble if you can help it, you are NOT TO ENGAGE THE ENEMY, but simply to drive away. There's a saying "He Who Runs Away Today, Lives To Fight Another Day". Your primary job isn't to be engaged as a combatant, its to drive. So drive away as fast and as far as you can! Simple as that.<br><br>And the reason for posting this, its because I feel after interacting with the exchange students in my school from Mexico and France. I feel that they are people who live for today and what happens tomorrow, we will worry about it when it comes. And that's a bloody wrong mentality, its like why do we save and not spend every cent we have? The Mexicans and French have conscription as well, but on a "luck-draw" basis. But thing is, if either countries go to conflict, Mexico can rely on the Big Brother next door the good ol' USA while the French have the FFL and their European Union friends to give them a hand. What about us? Yes we have the FPDA, Aussie, UK, NZ, M'sia. I can assure you if we go into conflict, sensitive as it may be, it would be our neighbours from up north or down south. How long do you reckon it will take for any aid in the form of Aussie, UK, NZ to arrive? If the US wants a share of it, how long do they need to arrive as well? We have to rely on nobody but our own friggin selves for at least 1wk. In this day and age, 1wk in war is helluva long time. Thus, I hope you put some thought into what I posted, for I know that the only free people are those whom are willing to fight for their freedom. And when I fight, its not because I have to or voted for the government, but its because I believe that giving your life for something you believe in is the greatest thing anybody can do. And I believe.<br><br>**PS. whatever you see, please keep them to yourself.**</div>
