But you are probably comparing the empty weight of the SAR-21 (3.82kg) with the loaded weight (30rd mag) of the TAR-21 (3.62kg).<br>If you refer to the STEngg and IMI corporate homepage,<br><a href="http://www.stengg.com/CoyCapPro/detail.aspx?pdid=133" rel="nofollow">www.stengg.com/CoyCapPro/detail.aspx?pdid=133</a><br><br><a href="http://www.imi.co.il/imi/doa_iis.dll/Serve/item/English/1.1.2.12.2.5.html" rel="nofollow">www.imi.co.il/imi/doa_iis.dll/Serve/item/English/1.1.2.12.2.5.html</a><br>the empty weight of the TAR-21 is only 2.8kg.<br>the loaded weight of the SAR-21 is 3.82+0.16(laser)+0.46(mag with 30rd)=4.44kg<br><br>So the difference is 0.9 to 1 kg, which can be used this to carry two extra mags or one water bottle.<br><br></div>

Because while its quirks takes getting used to, I can shoot far better with it then I ever could with the M-16, and it's added plus points are the points that matter. Durability, ease of use, reliability and far, far less mainteince and crankiness then the M-16 in field conditions. That's what will help me live in war, not how strange it is to hold or if it looks too much like the Aug. </strong><br><br>for the SAR-21, it's not how strange it is to hold, it's the fact that the hand guard is a tat too thick for most of us. u mentioned ease of use, personally as a part of the BRC element, i wouldn't define the SAR21 as user friendly. i won't diagree on the point that i could shoot better wif the SAR21, but if in a battle condition, the few additional seconds could be the crucial few seconds that would determine your survivor in the field.<br><br>if the durability, ease of use, reliability,less maintainence and crankiness is a plus point, then user-unfriendliness (thick handguard) ,poor location of mode of firing would certainly be  minus points.<br><br><strong>What we need is a rifle that will allow us to project firepower and do so putting as little strain in unnecessary nontatical costs like cleaning it constantly and reliability issues. The real job of a soldier is not to sit around cleaning his rifle of rust or clearing common jams in battle, it is to kill the enemy. In that respect does the SAR allow us to do that job better with less of those side issues? Of course. That is by any measure, the true "trusty" rifle</strong><br><br>hahah i dun think anyone would say to their encik that it's not a soldier's job to clean toilets, sweep floor the next time he do the inspection rite?<br><br>every new rifle or side arms would would definately neeed minimum cleaning. who among all of us had a chance to be issued wif a brand new M-16? i'm not gonna say the SAR 21 is gonna have more cleaning and reliability probs in the future. but at least when people give their views of certain issues, take it gentlemenly and respond gentlemenly.<br><br>obviously  at this point in time, we have people in combat vocations having views abt the SAR21 and how or rather wat improvement they would like to see on the SAR21. u hav ur views i hav my take. so let's be sensible and engage the topic, not the people who air their views.  terima kasih.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Ah ... my mood is better now ... Arsenal won 5-0 !!! muahahhaha ... Now back on topic ..<br><br>Some of you guys are set in saying SAR rocks, and some go SAR sucks! Some of you guys might even be SAF spies sent here change general opinion about the SAR  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"> (nah j/k). There's nothing I can do to change that.<br><br>All my posts were typed based on memory, I haven't touched the SAR for a while now, and I forgot some stuff. Heck, all i remember was my general opinion of the SAR. So there probably are still a lot of good/bad points that I didn't cover.<br><br><strong>Now, my main point is, when a rifle has quite has still quite a few bad points, albeit all minor ones, it is an unfinished product. Many minor faults on a weapon = 1 not-so-good weapon</strong>.<br><br>I really hope the SARs that were sent my unit were part of a testing phase. Because while the SAR does look good on paper, its ground performance is sorely lacking. And I really am not far off with my comment. 2 battalions (mine and my sister inf unit) that switched from M16 to SAR midway maintained that it sucked right up to their ORD dates. What the top brass say about our SAR is rather irrevalent, they have to support the SAR because they are regulars; critizing the SAR openly would be career suicide. Designers can praise it to the heavens, but ground units are the ones to use the SAR extensively, and if they say it sucks, it sucks.<br><br>I have nothing against locally produced arms, in fact if the US starts buying our SAR I would feel proud as a Singaporean. But the reality is SAR still has some technical issues to sort out before they start phasing out all the M16s. When the time comes where most issues have been sorted out, only then I will say "SAR is a good weapon".<br><br>So I say to STK/DSTA or whoever it is that designs SAR : Gather more info and feedback from those who have used a variety of weapons including SAR in actual combat. Don't just get all your feedback from high ranking officers, retired personel, engineers, punks and the like; accept negative feedback from ADF and units who are using or have used the SAR before as they are the ones who will use the weapon the most in the end.<br><br>Then go back to the drawing table and make a better SAR; one that combines all current pros, and eliminates most of the cons. As someone mentioned earlier, nobody has perfected a weapon in 3 years. Hopefully in another few years we'll be seeing better SAR models.<br><br>Peace out<br>~meander~</div>

Since some TAR makes can reuse the M16 mags, I don't see why the SAR (somewhat similar to TAR) can't reuse them. Even if they had to replace the mags, why use polymers that have to be reinforced on the outside instead of sticking to metal mags? </blockquote>That's because polymer mags are far more durable, stronger and most importantly, do not warp.<br><br>It can be fatal in battle when you realize you can't load your magazine because you warped your metal magazine back then when you went prone. Metal as a material for a magazine is unstable, it expands considerably when heated, tends to warp and is vulnerable to environmental conditions. Polymers as a materal are far more stable. I also like the feature that you can see how many rounds you have left. No grabbing for a misplaced, four round mag by accident in the heat of battle. I also hate to die because my last magazine refused to load after I dropped it on a hard surface accidently.<br><br>Also, I suspect the reason why STK made the SAR-21 use its own mags (hereby setting up a logistical issue) was because SAF itself announced it's intentions that it was going to totally replace the M-16 in due time.<br><br>Granted the current polymer mags are not perfect, but they are certainly superior to the old metal mags, and with a proper magazine pouch most of your problems with drawing them will cease to exist.</div>

It is technique and practise. Of all the theories taught, the two most important in combat is to place the cheek in the correct position on the butt (so your eye is aligned to the sights immediately), and squeeze the trigger as fast as possible without jerking the barrel.

            <div class='col-md body'>My unit STILL uses AR-15.. so anything better then that will be greatly appreciated. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_redface.gif" alt="Embarassed" title="Embarassed"><br><br>It seems to me most of the discussion to date has been focused on reliability, selector switch, weight and the new "plastic" MAGs.  I do not and cannot agree or disagree wif them as I have never had a chance to use the SAR.  However, I would choose the SAR over my AR-15 for the following reasons:<br><br>Bullpup design has shorter overall length - most modern weapons are now on Bullpup design.  The shorter length is especially useful in FIBUA.  How do u like jumping through windows and swinging through doors with a SAW??  M-16 (for my case AR-15) is simply too long for my liking.  And as in ALL bullpup designs (not juz SAR), MAGs are placed behind, naturally mag changing will be slower then say M-16s.  But I guess I can live with that.<br><br>Build in Scope - I am a section sharp shooter.. suppose to carry a scope with my AR-15 (yes.. NCC weapon  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_redface.gif" alt="Embarassed" title="Embarassed"> ) But in reality, it was never used coz its too difficult to zero and keep it that way.. in fact, I have not even seen the scope since I became NSman 10 years ago!  Now, how "OPERATIONAL READY" a NSman am I?  I suppose one cannot compare maintenance of iron sights with optical sights, the latter would surely be more complex ... but I'm not complaining as long as I can shoot better with it.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>"Plastic" MAGs - In my years firing with AR-15s (since NCC days).. THE major cause of IAs is actually due to faulty MAGs.. the cheap (look and feel) made in SIN metallic mags gets deform when dropped.. once the top part of the MAG is dented, it cannot align the rounds at a proper angle for the rifle to chamber them correctly, thus the IAs.  I suppose the new MAGs can handle abuse better and I like the see through feature..  I'm not sure how many of u guys actually count your rounds when firing (i try)..  Bt I think it will be difficult to do that in a "live" situation.  Being able to see balance rds can be of real help when making split second decisions.<br><br>Great CG - I have tried holding the SAR at several SAF shows and more recently AA2004.  I find the rifle balanced (weight).  Its comfortable to hold and I assume its as comfortable to fire.  I HATED the M203s and dislike the SAW's CG.  M203 is extremely uncomfortable to hold in firing position due to the extreme weight in front.  I'm not sure how many ppl can actually hold M203 in standing shoulder position for 5 mins and still hit their targets.  I think I can do it with the SAR.   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br><br>I too dislike some features on the SAR.. I feel that its a little bulky and a tad heavy.  I'm sure we can benefit with a less "Kisu" configuration.. a more barebone config like the AUG.<br><br>I can live with the "cons" coz I think the "pro" side is heaver here. Overall, I feel the SAR is a step forward.  So, please, please (x1000) melt the AR-15s and give me the SAR21!!   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz"></div>

And as in ALL bullpup designs (not juz SAR), MAGs are placed behind, naturally mag changing will be slower then say M-16s.  But I guess I can live with that.<br><br>Build in Scope - I am a section sharp shooter.. suppose to carry a scope with my AR-15 (yes.. NCC weapon  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_redface.gif" alt="Embarassed" title="Embarassed"> ) But in reality, it was never used coz its too difficult to zero and keep it that way.. in fact, I have not even seen the scope since I became NSman 10 years ago!  Now, how "OPERATIONAL READY" a NSman am I?  I suppose one cannot compare maintenance of iron sights with optical sights, the latter would surely be more complex ... but I'm not complaining as long as I can shoot better with it.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>"Plastic" MAGs - In my years firing with AR-15s (since NCC days).. THE major cause of IAs is actually due to faulty MAGs.. the cheap (look and feel) made in SIN metallic mags gets deform when dropped.. once the top part of the MAG is dented, it cannot align the rounds at a proper angle for the rifle to chamber them correctly, thus the IAs.  I suppose the new MAGs can handle abuse better and I like the see through feature..  I'm not sure how many of u guys actually count your rounds when firing (i try)..  Bt I think it will be difficult to do that in a "live" situation.  Being able to see balance rds can be of real help when making split second decisions.<br><br>Great CG - I have tried holding the SAR at several SAF shows and more recently AA2004.  I find the rifle balanced (weight).  Its comfortable to hold and I assume its as comfortable to fire.  I HATED the M203s and dislike the SAW's CG.  M203 is extremely uncomfortable to hold in firing position due to the extreme weight in front.  I'm not sure how many ppl can actually hold M203 in standing shoulder position for 5 mins and still hit their targets.  I think I can do it with the SAR.   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br><br>I too dislike some features on the SAR.. I feel that its a little bulky and a tad heavy.  I'm sure we can benefit with a less "Kisu" configuration.. a more barebone config like the AUG.<br><br>I can live with the "cons" coz I think the "pro" side is heaver here. Overall, I feel the SAR is a step forward.  So, please, please (x1000) melt the AR-15s and give me the SAR21!!   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz"> </div></blockquote>you're from Airforce too?<br>i was posting almost the same thing as u...but i guess frontline soldier have different view from us...<br>we never have the luxary of having a brand new weapon..let alone a new model..</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Source:  Defenseworld.net (register to read in full + graphics)<br><br><strong>SAR-21 for Singapore</strong><br><span style="font-style: italic;">An Overview of the Development of the SAR-21 Assault Rifle</span><br><br>(The new SAR-21 is expected to progressively replace the M16 as the standard issue assault rifle in service with the Singapore Armed Forces.)<br><br>The conceptual design phase of the SAR 21 (Singapore Assault Rifle for the 21st century) Started at Chartered Industries of Singapore (a member of Singapore Technologies) in 1993. Development activities over the first two years were mostly focused on feasibility studies and the search for viable design technology. The key aim for the project was to develop an assault rifle which should have significantly higher hit probability than the M16 (the current standard-issue individual weapon of the Singapore Armed Forces), while at the same time being more pact and offering a lower overall system weight (when fitted with an equipment aiming device ). The rifle should also be equipped with an integrated optical sight.<br><br>The SAR 21 is a 5.56 mm caliber, gas-operated, Â“bullpupÂ” configured weapon system capable of firing in semi-automatic and full-automatic modes. The Â“bullpupÂ” configuration results in a shorter rifle without any reduction in the barrel length; indeed, the barrel length of SAR 21 is the same as in   the M16, and therefore the inherent advantages (such as round dispersion and overall accuracy) that are barrel length-dependent were not compromised by the project goalÂ’s of a   compact weapon.<br><br>In addition to being lighter and shorter than the M16 it is intended to replace in SAFÂ’s service, the SAR-21 offers other significant advantages on terms of integrated day/night sighting capability, full automatic controllability, ease of maintenance, reduced recoil and additional safety features.<br><br>The SAR21 is modular in design consisting of five basic assemblies: barrel, upper receiver, lower receiver, bolt and magazine groups (see drawing). The modular construction allows ease of disassembly/reassembly and maintenance. The operator needs only to disengage two takedown pins and the weapon may then be field stripped in a matter of seconds or reassembled in less than a minute without the use of tools. Once field-stripped, all component parts requiring operator maintenance, cleaning or inspection are readily accessible.<br><br>Extensive use of modern and advanced engineering plastic materials is made for the weapon's upper receiver body, safety shield, hand-guard and lower receiver.<br><br>Accessories include rifle sling, blared firing attachment, cleaning kit, bore sighting equipment and Miles attachment.<br><br><strong>OPERATION </strong><br><br>The SAR-21 is magazine-fed, and has a close-bolt type of firing mechanism. The weapon uses a long-stroke piston with the main spring well protected inside the   guide tube. The bolt tube has two large locking lugs that rotate 450 to lock with the barrel extension. The SAR-21 incorporates the CIS patented constant recoil principle to balance the bolt group and the recoil spring force in order to improve full automatic controllability.<br><br>Ejection is to the right and is accomplished by a rocking ejector. The cocking handle is fully ambidextrous as it is located on the centerline being protected within the housing scope mount when not in use.<br><br>The SAR-21 fires in semi-automatic and full-automatic modes. The mode-of-fire selector is housed in the lower receiver, while the safety button is just forward of the trigger.  The rifle uses a 30-rd translucent plastic magazine to enable the user to have a direct visual feedback on the number of rounds in stocks.<br><br>The SAR-21 features an integrated 1.5x optical scope and a laser aiming device (LAD), both of which are factory-zeroed and do not require further field zeroing for engagement.<br><br>The optical sighting axis is optimally positioned to suit the average firer. The LAD is specially configured to suit the weapon, and the activating button is positioned such that no loose cable is exposed. The LADS is powered by one AA-size battery which can last for 4 hours of continual usage. Both visible and IR LADs are available.<br><br>As both the optical sight and the LAD are integrated to the weapon, stringent requirements were specified. Under normal condition, other than general cleaning of lenses, no other preventive maintenance is required.<br><br><strong>Human Factor Engineering </strong><br><br>In the SAR-21 design, human factor considerations were heavily factored during the development stage. HFE trials involving hundreds of soldiers were conducted which has resulted in the current profile of the butt stock, the cheek rest on the upper receiver, and the location of the safety button and the cocking handle.<br><br>HFE also involves safety features. One of the main safety considerations in a Â“bull pupÂ” Rifle is that the firing chamber is much closer to the operatorÂ’s head than in a conventional rifle layout. To address this concern, the SAR-21 has been designed to provide the maximum protection possible by incorporating a built-in composite material Safety shield, metal reinforcement, positive large locking surfaces and by using a gas pressure venting hole in the barrel extension, to release the high pressure gas/blast.<br><br><strong>The Weapon Family concept:</strong><br><br>In addition to the standard-issue assault rifle, there are several possible variants of the SAR-21 to meet the varying requirements of different users and yet maintain high commonality of parts. This is achievable due to the modular concept adopted in its design.<br><br>Main variants include:<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Sharp Shooter Variant</span><br>This is a standard   SAR-21 with an integrated 3x optical scope. Replacement   of scope from 1.5x to 3x or vice-versa can be performed at unit level.<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Light Machine Gun Variant </span><br>This variant comes equipped with a heavy barrel and bipod, and operates in a full-automatic open bolt firing mode. More than 60% of the components are identical to the basic assault rifle.<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">SAR-21/M203 Variant</span><br>This is a   SAR-21 attached with a M203 grenade launcher with 9Â” barrel. The LAD is mounted on the quadrant platform.<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">SAR-21 Picatinny-Rail (P-Rail) Variant</span><br>This variant, featuring a sight-mounting platform in place of integrated optical sight permits the use of all types of optical, electro-optical or collimating sight as selected by the operator.<br><br><span class="small"><span style="font-style: italic;">Sourced with permission from Military Technology</span></span></div>
