            <div class='col-md body'>Just came back from ICT and had a 2 days SAR21 convertion...<br><br>Here is my take on SAR21........<br><br>1) The safty feature - When the magazine is empty, the bolt will be behind. No matter how you cock, the bolt just wont release itself. Only by removing the magazine then will you be able to release the bolt. This minimize the potential of mis-firing.<br><br>2) Ergonomic - like the feel of the weapon, very comfortable. Balanced weapon, wont feel front heavy even with the LAD. can even let is stand upright.<br><br>3) 1.5x scope - very accurate. Where you aim, the round will land there. 100m range, 100% on target (fig 11, 12 &amp; 15). Need some getting use to the scope though....must get the correct aiming position.<br><br>4) Weight - 4KG as compared to 2.85kg of M16. however, if the M16 was mounted with the S/S scope and LAD, then weight almost the same and M16 will be front heavy especially with the LAD.<br><br>5) Stripping and Assembly - easy to strip and assemble. Able to strip in 20sec and assmeble in 30sec. After L/F, easily clean.<br><br>6) Just like SAW, it is gas operated, thus need to adjust the gas regulator setting, I, II or III. Else would IA like mad. L/F preferably III........<br><br>7) No problem with the charging handle. Turn cocking level left, cocked with left hand, return cocking level to neutral position and move down to safty weapon. No problem for me.<br><br>8 ) Loading and Unloading - after checked clear, tilted weapon right and load in mag. Same method as unloading. Take some getting use to but dont see mush problem.<br><br>9) Recoil - personally think it is lighter than M16 but louder though due to the chamber being beside your face.<br><br>10) Trigger - double action same as M16.....no problem.<br><br>11) Mode selection - located near the butt stock. Though present location still ok BUT prefer to be somewhere near the pistol grip.....<br><br>All in all, it is a good and simple weapon......anyone with some proper coaching on the safety, can fire it immediately....<br><br>Imagine during operation, anyone can just pick up the weapon and fire........<br><br>All these are my personal opinion after handling and firing SAR21 last week.... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>
