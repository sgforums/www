So what he's trying to say is that ST, copied the TAR and produced the SAR in the one year difference between the two weapons being unveiled. More insanity.<br><br>What is more crazy and amusing is that we have a guy who has never handled the TAR-21 in real life (heck, most israeli soliders haven't even gotten a hold of it), and he's here trash talking as if he shot it every weekend.

            <div class='col-md body'>On the issue of SAR IAing seriously, according to my Guards friend, who experienced it on the range, it is not an issue of the weapon itself, but that the gas return valve had been set too low on the factory setting, causing a chance for the weapon not to cycle fully and jam. Once they opened it up to allow more gas to cycle, they had no more problems.<br><br>Which in the end brings me back to the point that it's no use hating the weapon, you must know how to really use it before you get to hating it. If you hate it right off the bat, then you are probablt not making a fair judgement and are probably missing out on a lot of the good things about it.<br><br>Yeah, SAF, in all its' wisdom, has not designed a new magazine pouch for the SAR yet.

            <div class='col-md body'>I did mention in my first post on the thread, that SAR 21 is a nice concept. <strong>But until it's implementation is refined, it sucks right now.</strong> I'm just here to voice out my personal opinions about the SAR, not to enforce them onto people. Basically here to answer some questions about the SAR to the curious bros since I've handled it in many excercises/LF first hand. <span style="font-style: italic;">Have you?</span><br><br><blockquote> ... seems that the SAR is always measured by the M-16 yardstick, rather then the universal yardstick for all assualt firearms. Which basically states that if the rifle does not give you the old feel of the M-16, it must be judged a drawback ... ... their whiny complains about how the SAR supposedly sucks seems more of a case of whining about why this amazing piece of firearm does not feel like the M-16.</blockquote>M16 and SAR are the old/new versions of the SAF basic infantry assualt weapons, seems logical to me to compare one to the other. I've never handled other assualt rifles, so I don't compare them. M-16 and SAR both have their own "feel", but I never said the SAR didn't feel enough like our ol' M16. Although I only mentioned SAR's faults in my previous posts, I measured them individualy on their merits/faults, and found that the M16 has an edge over SAR right now in terms of quick fire reaction, vital in combat survival.<br><br><blockquote> With their kind of logic in why the age old M-16 is supposedly a better weapon in this era, I guess I could pretty much build up a case on why muzzle loading muskets are better then an M-1 Garand with tons of obsqure reasons ... </blockquote>That's an outright exaggeration. While we're at it, let's compare a crossbow too. It shoots projectiles too you know ...<br><br><blockquote> ... I suspect all the supposed "advantages" of the M-16 over the SAR is more of a case of a old-bird trooper having adapted to the M-16's feel over the years ... Having spent far more time with the M-16 then the SAR, they are less inclined to view the SAR objectively ... newer troops, who have spent about equal amount of time with the M-16 and SAR, like my Guards friend, and hence in a position to make a far more objective statement as they had no time to end up emotionally attached to either weapon ...</blockquote>That's <strong>me</strong>. I'm not some 30 yr old bird lao chiao. I just ORDed last year from an infantry <strong>battalion</strong> (not some bde or div fellar that hardly goes outfield). That qualifies me to comment on the M16 vs SAR issue. During my NSF stint, I used the M16 for approx 1 year (training and unit), and the SAR for about 1.5 years (unit). So you see, <strong>I've actually used the SAR more than the M16.</strong> I'm about as objective as you can get (barring left handed issues). Also, the general consensus in our unit was that SAR sucks. I don't care what some designers sitting at a planning table think, but if we're gonna use the SAR, he better start listening to us.<br><br><blockquote><strong>By |-|05| : </strong>I believe he is using the 2nd or 3rd update of the weapon since the 1st version did not come with an iron sight. But the problem with the scope is still there since my friend who is currently using a SAR21 complains about it ... </blockquote>I rest the scope, and rifle version case. To each his own but please, SingaporeTyrannosaur, refrain from indirectly insulting me through your comments (like in the next quote).<br><br><blockquote>The issue of ribbed mags here is so ridiculus that the very fact it could even be brought up shows that those who slime the SAR apparently know virtually nothing about what they are talking about, but feel in a position to nit pick.</blockquote>I've used the SAR extensively in exercises. I didn't just test-fire the SAR with 30 live rounds and run out proclaiming it's a revolutionary weapon. I was a combat spec, a sec-com, and the SAR was my primary weapon.<br><br>About the mags, I do STILL stand by my comments. Maintaining and regulating fire towards the enemy is key to gaining ground or retreating. It also keeps you alive. <strong>ANYTHING</strong> that hampers with that I deem negative as it will cost lives in actual war. In the case of SAR, I really don't see why we couldn't have stayed with metal mags. The new plastic mags are a real pain. It's the same case with the positions of the mag ejection lever and the fire-mode selector, they're all in the wrong places and need to be fixed. This is about the lives of us combatants, and we reserve the right to complain about anything that affects us in combat because we fight the damn battle. Battles that can be won or lost because of the most trival things, and this could be one of them. Ridiculous (that word <span style="font-style: italic;">really</span> irked me)? Hardly.<br><br>Morals of the story : Innovation is fine, but if it aint broke, don't fix it. If everyone has the same minor problem, it's a major problem.<br><br>PS : Sorry bout the agressive tone, but as sombody in a combat vocation, I'm tired of allegations that we whine/complain too much. We do not only endure physical duress, but non-combantants will never understand the mental stress (esp cmdrs) that we went through also. Still, we hung on with pride when all choice, dignity and respect were stripped away from us, all to hold the frontlines when the time comes. <strong>Respect that, if nothing else.</strong><br><br>Peace, out<br>~meander~</div>

I can't remember the exact weight, but I'm not gonna dig it up. Take my word for it, It's more than a bit of difference. On extended missions it's a real damn pain it the neck.

            <div class='col-md body'>It is apparent that being left handed has seriously coloured your opinion of the firearm, but then again, it's not your fault you were born that way. Maybe you are better of with the '16.<br><br>There appears to be a mix of opinions on the SAR. No, the general opinion is greatly divided between two camps, namely those who love it and those who do not. From what I gathered, the higher up the SAF foodchain, the more positive the opinion of the weapon becomes. All in all, I seriously doubt considering the SAR a quote: "sucky" weapon is hardly justified.<br><br>I would wager it's more "sucky" attitude on the part of the unit which is using it, but I don't buy that for I prefer to be objective. But a poor attitude and bias towards a local weapon certainly does happen. I suspect if we were using Styer Augs, the negative feedback here would certainly be far lower. In fact, it seems that some people would be for once, actually objective.<br><br>The Americans suffer from the "Made in USA syndrome" where any weapon that is not made in the US of A is biased against. In Singapore, there is no denying that we have a serious syndrome of "Made in Singapore syndrome", in which inverse that which the yanks suffer.<br><br>I have no idea why some of us are this self-debasing towards local arms, but my idea is, the nationality of the weapon hardly matters. As long as it makes me shoot better and is far more reliable. I would take it any time. even if it was made in Afganistan.<br><br>And it's hardly the same, nit picking on issues like weight and polymer magazines cannot be confused with getting the big picture. Stealthguy's points are exactly the kind of logic you might want to follow if you want to go into a Black Hawk Down incident without body armour because your trusty BDU is lighter and cooler. There is a big difference between the two.<br><br>For one thing, I am not supporting the SAR because it is made in Singapore or ST for that matter. But because I have used both weapons before and saw instantly, that it was far better then the old workhorse.<br><br>There's no stopping it, it's a matter of progress. The SAR is not a step backwards, it is a step forwards. And I for one prefer to develop a skillset that allows me to maximize its potential, which is far above what an M-16 can give me in killing the target. And learn to live with the weapon, rather then whine about every single little detail that gets in my way.<br><br>What matters is that this weapon allows me to develop my potential as a trooper in projecting tatical firepower is the most effective and reliable way. That's what matters. Not tiny details like SBO pouches, cocking handle resistence and the like. If the SAR allows me to shoot better and is tough in the field, that's a weapon I can trust and I'll learn to live with those quirks, rather then play the expert in prop aircraft which looks at a jet and goes "It has no propeller"<br><br>At the end of the day, when two equally skilled units, one equipped with the SAR, the other with the M-16, face off. Who do you think has the edge? Who has more tatical flexibility? Who has more options? Who is more combat effective?<br><br>Of course, this is because I am right handed, for left handers...</div>

The first time we shot live rounds with our brand new SAR. I was safety spec for another spec shooting in burst mode, and the weapon IA-ed. The bolt carrier was stuck half foward for no apparent reason, and SAR could not be cocked. We took out the buttstock, and found an empty cartridge lodged inside the rifle. It was stuck so bad we had to use a pair of pliers (and used considerable force) to full the cartridge out.<br><br>It took 2 people 10 minutes to clear 1 bloody IA. With a pair of pliers.<br><br>When this IA is encountered with plastic blanks it is in fact easier to clear. They aren't hot and can be torn, unlike metal cartridges. </blockquote>when i was safety spec for my coy's ATP, i experienced a similar IA on an M16 as well... there was a double feeding in the mag AND the third round in the chamber had failed to eject properly, and lodged itself at the TOP of the bolt... and the bolt carrier was jammed halfway in that position.<br><br>we could remove the mag to clear the dbl feeding, but that weapon was essentially out of action for the rest of the day cos we couldn't detach the receiver groups from each other (cos the bolt was jammed halfway), we couldn't cock the weapon (cos the bolt was jammed), we couldn't get that offending round out, cos the pliers couldn't reach it...<br><br>its a freak accident... if it had happened in the field, nobody could've cleared that IA... the soldier would've been unarmed and in great danger. does that make the m16 a bad weapon? well... no... it just meant that u met with a freak accident!<br><br><blockquote>Before that, I shall reiterate the fact that I am a biased left handed SAR hater  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_evil.gif" alt="Evil or Very Mad" title="Evil or Very Mad">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_twisted.gif" alt="Twisted Evil" title="Twisted Evil"> .<br><br>I have a left master eye too, so I can't effectively operate the MG, 84, M203, LAW ... the list goes on.<br><br>Weapons aren't like your traditional can opener, we can't just switch to using them with our right hand.

Safe/Single/Auto. There will be situations where you put to safe, only to discover that a target pops up. If you take too long to select fire mode, you are either dead or lose the target.<br><blockquote><strong>Okay, this isn't really CS or some game u know.

But imagine a scenario where you are at "semi" to conserve ammo, then suddenly faced with a charging assault. Soldiers with the SAR-21 better pray that they not get shot while putting to "auto". Squeezing semi-shots rapidly may be their only survival chance.</div>
