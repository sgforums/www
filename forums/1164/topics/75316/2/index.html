From the previous post, it seems that we can change the zeroing for the LAM which is good. but how about the built in sight, can it be zeroed?<br><br>Or maybe even if it drift it doesn't really make much difference. because for most engagements we don't really have much chance to aim properly. just squeeze so aga aga can already.<br><br>Like when they move from 7.62 to 5.56 it is because the longer range is not much use because most soldiers cannot hit anything above 300m with their rifles.<br><br>If you see footages of the current fighting in Iraq, most of the time see the US and insurgents anyhow spray.

            <div class='col-md body'>if i remember correctly, the prefered mode of fire for M16 is burst i.e. in burst mode, the probability of hitting the target within x metres is 85% greater than in single or full-auto<br>and the first few versions of AR15 was having burst as the 1st selection after safe<br><br>for the AK47, the prefered mode is Auto, because the characteristics of the weapon prefers auto-firing.  so the first selection after safe is Auto.<br><br>So it really depends on mission and situation at that point in time.  To provide supressive fire is almost akin to the "spray first - aim later" i.e. keep the enemy's head down first, then realign later ... to have a chance of shooting back.  And needless to say ... when you are pinned down, popping a few shots out will provide a morale boost to the other fellas to fire back, when enemy shots are whizzing past your ears.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Forgive my ignorance that the SAR cannot use M16 magazine. Good to know that now.<br><br><strong>Drilling the Magazine</strong><br>Drilling holes into the M16 magazine will not reduce the structural strength if you know where to drill. Remember that our M16 magazines have 2 holes drilled to make them compatible with the Ultimax 100? But if polymer magazines are cheaper and lighter to make, I am in full support of it.<br><br><strong>Integrated Laser Innovation</strong><br>As for the integrated laser sights, soldiers in my platoon have been black-taping common laser pointers (less that 50 grams and $10) to the M16. Gives same results, because at close range, perfect zeroing is not necessary. Only problem is it has no IR capability. So the SAR21 designers cannot claim novelty on this. Effective? Yes. Innovation? No. Unless it can shoot around corners.<br><br><strong>Cocking Discomfort</strong><br>If course, cocking the rifle while holding the hand guard is always comfortable. But what I meant was holding the pistol grip while cocking. This is a faster response as the firing hand is still near the trigger.<br><br><strong>Weight Issue</strong><br>Don't equate fitness with weapon weight. A lighter, compact weapon is always better. US soldiers prefer their M4 for this reason, despite its short range. The extra weight shedded could have been used to carry more ammo. If you strip away all the plastics and un-useless parts, you will see that the basic rifle skeletal is just a skinny metal tube. It still fires without distortion.<br><br><strong>Compactness</strong><br>This refers to the volume of the weapon. Don't you agree that a compact weapon is less visible and more "tactical"? It will also takeup less space inside vehicles and storage? If the designers have been more innovative, they should have considered building the SAR such that they are stackable for storage and transportation.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>From the PoV of an infantry spec in the unit who has used both the SAR and the M16 in unit exercises,<br><br><strong>SAR sucks.</strong> Nice concept, but it's implementation stinks until someone bothers to refine it. Maybe I'm a biased left hander.<br><br><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Weight</span></strong><br>The SAR is considerably heavier than the M16. The weight difference might not be much when you first hold it, but try holding it in extended missions (above 10km), and it's a literal pain in the neck with a rifle sling. While it's not as heavy as MGs and stuff, we are expected to do rapid fire movement with the SAR unlike the MG team.<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Scope</strong></span><br>The SAR is useless in rainy weather and muddy terrain. Rain water or mud could splash onto the front end of the scope and obscure the view. The same could happen to an M16 too, but the front of the scope is made of glass material and is harder to clean compared to an iron sight. You might be able to clear off the mud, but you'll still get a pretty blur view. Rain is a bigger problem if it drips onto the iron sight, because if it doesn't stop, it's pointless to wipe the scope.<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Iron Sight</strong></span><br>Located on top of scope. I suspect this feature is a joke by ST engineers. It's completely useless because it's too small and you can't zero it.<br><br><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Magazine</span></strong><br>Innovative. Made of clear transparent plastic with markings at the back that enable the soldier to see amount of rounds he has left. However, it's impractical as it is too big for the current SBO (by current i mean 1-2 years ago when I was still in the army) that is too small to hold 2 SAR mags in the same pocket. Also, the rings around the body of the mag will interlock with another mag further interfering with combat reloading. Major pain.<br><br><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Immediate Stoppages</span></strong><br>We were told the SAR IAs less the the M16. That's much is true. But when SAR does IA, chances are that it's a very serious one that cannot be cleared quickly (expended cartridge stuck behind bolt carrier). You might even have to strip the SAR to clear it. I'll rather choose the M16 that IAs more than the SAR that might not be able to recover from IA.<br><br><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Interior</span></strong><br>Whatever material they used to make the inside rusts a lot easier. My SAR was only 4 months old, and it came back post mission with some serious rust. No, I didn't do water ops. Yes, it was clean and rust free when i went out with it. Maybe the SAR is still in the testing stage and I got some beta version? Personal hypothesis : SAF make these first versions with cheap metal, tests it in the field. After which they make newer final versions, and then sell the "beta" versions to other our neighbours.<br><br><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Deflectors and left handers</span></strong><br>I'm a left hander, and I totally hate the SAR. I'm biased. Why? The SAR does not have a deflector add-on. They have some mini joke of a built in deflector, which btw is some small triangular piece of plastic. It doesn't do its deflecting job <strong>AT ALL.</strong> During live firing, as would be the case during war, I get hit by like 90% of the bloody hot empty cartriges.<br><br><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Bayonet</span></strong><br>Erm ... what bayonet? THere's nowhere to fix it on. Sure, in close range combat you could smash the enemy's head with the heavy rifle butt. But given the SAR is barely 1m long, you might not reach the bugger before he pokes you with <strong>HIS</strong> bayonet.<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Outer Casing</strong></span><br>Someone told me the outer casing is made of Kevlar. No idea. Even if it is, SAR still looks like a toy. Anway there are claims that the SAR will protect the soldier's precious face in event of a chamber explosion as the casing and rifle interior can contain it. Means jack to me becasuse as a left-hander, my face is right behind the ejection port. If the rifle goes boom, the blast impact will go only where it can, out of the ejection port, to my face ...<br><br><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Fire mode selector</span></strong><br>The bullpup design forces the fire mode selector to be positioned behind at the buttstock where the trigger and firing mechanism are also located. Tough to change fire mode during combat.<br><br><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Other rare plus points</span></strong><br><ul>SAR interior is easier to clean due to it's design.<br>Has a lighter recoil compared to the M16 (further making it seem like a toy).<br>The weight is evenly distributed making it easier on aiming.<br>The SAR has better accuracy due to scope (barring crap weather/ground) than M16 in close range.<br>Integrated LAD is nice idea.<br>Zeroing will remain no matter how many times one drops the weapon. Note: nobody in our unit was willing to test the claim by repeatly dropping the SAR during range. </ul><br><br>Besides, if SAR is so good, SoF/STAR/SWG would have switched to SAR long ago.</div>
