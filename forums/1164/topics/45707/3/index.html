It is obvious that Singapore had comfortable defence co-operation with France while still not fermanting our long relationship with the US , thus dun be pesismistic that the NGF will mostly be from a US source.<br></div>

The Americans would want this contract most among the rest of the contracts for this reason(hence more likely to let politics influence) and we'll be happy to let them win this because of its bearing on the future JSF involvement, among other things.<br><br>We're slightly less dependant on US political meddling, but we more dependant than most people think.

Which is fine and good, I hope the liars masquerading as journalists in places like Utusan Malaysia won't accuse us of being "unneighbourly" when we bring back the AMRAAMs and buy HARMs.<br><br>Yes, they'll have to support air-dropped weapons from all these different sources, which does nothing for their potential logistics logjam. But then, the alternative is rewiring the mission computers, software etc etc of one type to accept weapons from the other type. Which sadly, with all due respect, is beyond the capabilities of their local industry, with or without Indian help.</div>

There are too many other interests involved. This is going to be big news, its going to get a lot of media coverage, a lot of tax payers money is going to be spent. A lot of jobs are at stake. The fortunes of a lot of big companies are at stake and many of these big companies have important government backing which brings political considerations into play in a variety of different countries. So a purchase like Malaysia's US$1 billion plus purchase of Russian fighter aircraft triggers always inevitably a bidding war. And the familiar players are all there, the big American aircraft companies, the French, the Russians, etc. They all want the business. No government, Malaysia or anyone else, can ignore that aspect. None of them can ignore how this will be connected to their foreign relations. None of them can ignore how it will be connected to their economic considerations, how much money can they have spent on assembling this package in their own country for instance as opposed to spending it all on buying the equipment off the shelf from the foreign supplier. Those decisions are always in the end made by elected officials and they look at other things. Malaysia is doing that. It is attempting to strike a balance between how much money it has available, what its airforce needs, what it can function most efficiently with, and how it can best use this purchase to help promote its goals in diplomacy and foreign relations".<br><br><strong>From what I understand in reports, the Defence ministry has either overspent or nearly exhausted its $2.8 billion allocation after heavy outlays on French submarines, British and Russian air-defence systems, Polish tanks, guns for the troops and new naval bases. How is Malaysia going to manage halfway through a five-year economic plan,? </strong>Are they going to resort to some form of contra payment - perhaps palm oil?<br><br>"Even if they resort to some sort of a barter arrangement, palm oil for planes. That's still going to have an economic impact. That's palm oil that they're going to have to give away instead of selling for hard currency to somebody else. Its going to have an economic effect and there isn't any clever slate or hand trick that they can use to avoid that. There are really only three things that they can do. One, swallow the necessary cost as an unavoidable expense of defending the country and promoting their foreign policy goals. Two, Make it possible to spend that money by cutting some other aspect of military spending. Or three, defer the cost to the point where it becomes nothing more than a book keeping matter. That the eventual expense will be incurred over 15 to 20 years and its in effect putting the problem off for a successor government to face another day.There is no way to avoid that, palm oil isn't an answer".<br><br>The purchase of these weapons from Russia, its more than just a defence purchase, it also building a sort of relationship. And I understand Russian President Putin is expected to visit Malaysia sometime before October. So how do you see relations between Malaysia and Russia, bouncing off the rest of the region here?<br><br>"Malaysia of course is not comfortable with the increasing profile of the US in South East Asia. Its ambivalent about this, of course on the one hand it shares much common ground with the Americans when it comes to the war on terrorism, particularly terrorism as pressed by intolerant fundamentalist groups claiming to be fighting in the name of Islam. Malaysia has a domestic political problem of its own in that respect. But on the other hand, the differences that the Malaysian government now have with the American government are outweighing their common ground. Malaysia remains very upset about the American led war on Iraq, it believes that America has pursued a clumsy and excessively physical foreign policy in its war on terror. That its increased its presence in the region in an unfriendly way which is expanding American influence to the detriment of ASEAN when it comes to defence policy and foreign policy. And obviously if it can take steps to pursue some sort of a counter weight to American influence in the region, it will be considering them. Reaching out to the Russians, pursuing a trail thats already been blazed by going on with purchasing Russian weapons to replace earlier older Russian systems that Malaysia already has. That can be presented as not an abrupt and radical change in policy. They've already done business with the Russians. But its also unmistakably a signal to the Americans that there are other people who can supply the kind of equipment that Malaysia needs and other powers whose agenda isn't necessarily identical with the Americans, who might be willing to align themselves with those who want to complain about American agendas or challenge American policies".<br><br>Associate Professor Brian Farrell from the National University of Singapore speaking with Augustine Anthuvan.<br><br>---------<br><br>Does anyone have a breakdown on the cost (or kickbacks - depending on how you look at it) of each set of military purchases? What is their total allocation for Malaysia's defence budget of their 5-year economic plan?<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>When things are bought for in cash, it really drains the country's foreign reserver .. i.e USA dollars.<br><br>Lets look at how hard it is to EARN US$1.00 .. In Singapore, in order to earn that US$1.00, we have to SELL stuff to people who pay for it in US$ .. so we have to BUY stuff first .. hence outflow of US$ to buy stuff, mark up, add value, create jobs, infrastructure, educating workforce, housing, etc .. inorder to earn US$ by RESELLING the product ... So for every US$1.00 we earn, alot of it is spent already on other parts of the economy (which is good) and alot of it is spent buying raw materials and remitting to overseas from salaries of FW (which is bad)<br><br>Over in Malaysia, its just as hard (if not harder) to earn that US$1.00 .. they have to do everything we have to do in order to get people to buy their goods and pay that US$1.00 .. but if they use PALM OIL to pay part of that US$900million, what happens?<br><br>Well, what is the cost of creating US$1.00 worth of palm oil? The only cost that GOES OUT of the country is the remittance sent by the BANGLADESHI workers to their families. SO out of a salary of say RM400 a month, they at most can send RM200. But everything else is RM denominated. Every other part of the supply chain in creating that 1 ton of palm oil is Malaysian made or controlled. From the land, the companies doing it, the processing plant, the palm oil research, the transport of palm oil overseas, the commodity trading, the manufacturing of palm oil by-products, the regulatory of trade .. its all Malaysian. Even if Indonesia sells palm oil, the Malaysians make money. Anyone in the world buy or sell palm oil, the Malaysians make money (the palm oil trading centre of the world is Malaysia)<br><br>Basically, all that means is that RM3.80 worth of palm oil into the market is easier for Malaysia to manufacture/earn/give away compared to US$1.00 So definately, they are using this method to<br><br>a) Sell palm oil<br>b) Help the primary industry of palm oil manufacturing<br>c) Keep people employed<br>d) Take a stab against the soya oil people<br>e) Get some new weaponary<br><br>All that ties in very nicely with that Professor's Q&amp;A session with our reporter. Guess that the Malaysians aren't that dumb after all.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Read that article already, maybe Rafale does not employ the 3 types of RCS reduction Carlo Kopp mentions, but its active radar cancellation technology is something the SuperBug doesn't have. Avaition writers the world over have already agreed that Rafales RCS is the best among the modern multirole fighters save for the F-22 and JSF.<br><br>In case you didn't know, the Super Hornet has its pylons canted and toe-out 3 degrees due to some pretty nasty stores separation problem. Which kind of ensures whatever RCS savings from its gizmos will come to naught when it comes to carrying stores.<br><br>I'd hate to question Carlo Kopp's credentials, but I've heard lots of criticism over his stubborn campaign to keep the F-111 in RAAF service despite a mounting bill to keep the Pigs flying by arguing it still relevant and needed by Australia.

Given that he is still a civilian and has very limited access to ADF's accounting and budgetting plans. I don't think he understood what it is for ADF to adopt his proposal. One fine example is him suggesting RAAF to upgrade the pigs with a new radar with SAR mode. Integrate the pigs with the latest guided munitions like JDAMs, etc. Proposed RAAF purchase the Raptors as "silver bullets", etc. All these suggests sound good but in the real world, many of them are not practical due to the simple fact of lack of $$$$ !!!!.<br><br>As to the topic about Rafale being stealtier than the Super bugs, Dassault engineers and marketing personels will quickly point out that Rafales does use radar absorbing materials and paint, plus the aircraft shaping has already taken stealth into consideration. Rather than spending a hell lot more money to achieve even higher degree of stealth (comparable to the US 5th gen aircrafts), Dassault opted to use electronic means (radar cancelling method) to reduce Rafale RCS even further. In fact, radar cancelling method that they have employed interest the American heaps. I won't be surprised to see this as part of the F-35 package because the "AESA" radar derived from F-22 can be built with this feature.  F-35 might end up being more stealty than F22 !!!! <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br></div>

The Su30MKM is to be produced by Irkut Corp., previously known as the Irkutsk Aviation Production Assn. It will be based on the Su30 version Irkut is currently producing for the Indian air force, known as the Su30MKI.<br><br>This derivative of the Flanker is arguably the most advanced yet in service. The aircraft is fitted with the NIIP N011M Bars passive electronically scanned-array radar.<br><br>While details of the Malaysian aircraft configuration and weapons package have yet to be revealed, some Russian industry sources suggest the aircraft will retain all of the air-to-surface capability of the Indian version.<br><br>The original Su-27 was a single-role air-to-air platform, but as the design evolved, later versions moved toward a multirole capability. The sources added that the Malaysian aircraft will have modified avionics in comparison to the Su-30MKI. Some of the systems for the Indian air force were provided from Israel.<br><br>Contract signature on the Su-30MKM is anticipated during the third quarter of 2003, following the conclusion of detailed contract negotiations.<br><br>Besides air-to-air and air-to-ground weaponry, the Malaysian air force will likely look to equip the Su-30MKM with a maritime strike capability. Options may include the Kh-35 (AS-20 Kayak), or the Kh-31A (AS-17 Krypton). Malaysia also might seek to purchase the Indo-Russian Brahmos, now in the final stages of development. Brahmos is a version of the Russian 3M-55 Onyx (SS-N-26) rocket-ramjet powered anti-ship missile. Indian officials have already identified Malaysia as a potential export target.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>To trip wire,<br><br><strong>and just who is gonna be the good provider of this credit.. afterall.. someone gotta incurred the cost in providing this nice credit...  </strong><br><br>Malaysia of course, they run the whole palm oil show .. so they can even use the palm oil credits instead of cash to pay for their military equipment.<br><br><strong> i would have thought that since they are already in possesion of the credit... they could only sell it for $$$ right??  of course... at wat price, is something that the russkies would have to decide later... </strong><br><br>The credit is not really worthless .. they can sell it to India and China who needs the palm oil. So the Indians and China people can give them cash or goods in kind.<br><br><strong> you talk like palm oil has no cost of production one... and whether it is palm oil or money or money derived from palm oil sale... ultimately... one cannot escape the economic reality of opportunity cost...  </strong><br><br>Its cheaper for the Malaysians to produce RM3.80 worth of palm oil than to earn US$1.00 from exporting electronic equipment. In fact, by freeing their US$ from being tied up on arms purchases, their precious US$ reserves can be used to buy shipping companies, etc.<br><br><strong>how can it be the same answer?? unless there is no such guarantees... which would understandably imply the ruskies would demand more palm oil then the actual market value to make up for the risk in holding palm oil derivatives right?? ruskies aint dumb you know?  </strong><br><br>Actually, there is a precedent already .. go to yahoo and search under palm oil barter .. you will see that in 1999 or something, Malaysia bartered RM2.9b worth of palm oil to India and China in exchange for a railroad project. There was no dumping, and that was a bigger amount like 6x the RM500m I am talking about now.<br><br><strong> and who is gonna pay them?? how can everyone make money when no one is spending?? think we have half the equation missing... dont we?  </strong><br><br>The Malaysians are giving credits .. its never said or implied that transportation costs are free .. (always look for ways for businessmen to make money somewhere in between!)<br><br><strong> more barter trading???  like that no need money liow lor   ... banks can all close shop ...  </strong><br><br>The barter trade is between Malaysian government and Russian government. If its a deal between the Malaysian government and a private enterprise (like for F18s) they will have to pay cash.<br><br><strong> malaysia aint doing this the first time... so it makes one wonder... why other countries dont follow malaysia's style if it is really so good..  </strong><br><br>Haven't your read? India wants to do the same with their Onion crop.<br><br><strong>nothing new lah... but unfortunately for them... palm oil got an inherent weakness compare to soya oil..... its called.... P A L M I T I C A C I D.... very very bad stuff... mess up your artery and kills your heart...  </strong><br><br>Thats only if you eat the stuff. Palm oil is now mainly used to make plastics, soap and detergents. Only the very poor will use palm oil for cooking. When we visit JB for shopping, like in Giant and Carrefour, you don't see shelves stocked up with palm oil. You see lots of different oils like sunflower, canola, soyabean, peanut etc.<br><br>However, the soap, shampoo, detergent you use all contain palm oil. Not to mention, the lipsticks, the plastic container, the mineral water bottle ... etc ...</div>

It is currently included in EOC 2.<br><br>The Brimstone is being integrated on the Harrier GR7/9 and Tornado GR4. With this capability on these two platforms, integration on the Typhoon, they argue, is by no means essential.<br><br>The final number of Typhoons to be procured by the RAF remains in doubt.

            <div class='col-md body'>Actually i believe for Malaysia to trade with palm oil is normal.Why?They need to get rid of their palm oil and they do not have cash so instead they give away their products instead of giving cash it's the same deal.Anyway back on topic does anyone know the stats for the SU-30?Cuz from what i know about old soviet made planes they have this thing about having very poor range...</div>

They do have great range, only behind F-111, F22 Raptors and perhaps F-15E.<br><br></div>
