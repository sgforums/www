            <div class='col-md body'>The SU-30 is a very capable plane. On paper. It has no credible combat records and is not proven. Malaysia might very well be another "beta-tester" for the Russians. As someone has pointed out earlier, the super maneuvability of the SU-30 will be severely impeded with a full fuel load.<br><br>Another point that we have to look at is the network ability of the planes. RMAF has quite a few types of planes, Russian and American. How they intend to form a coherent fighting force out of these two contrasting types is debatable, if can be done in the first place. If they intend to use the SU-30 like the US is going to with the F-22, a "silver bullet" of sorts, it will get them nowhere. It might sound stupid, but with only 18 jets, it is very possible that that is what they want to do.<br><br>Purchasing the "best" fighters from two different countries is not what I call smart. It is quite obvious that they want to show off those planes, and simply win on specs. Just to point out, Russians don't exactly have a good supply chain as well.<br><br>I don't understand why the Mig-29s are not going to be traded in as well. It is just going to be an extra burden.<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by Forever84:</div><div class="quote_body">Too bad singapore will proly buy from US<br>typhoons r really good</div></blockquote>Its not probable that Singapore will get the US jets for the A-4 replacements, although that may happen. The reasons have been widely debated in this forum already.</div>

I seriously don't think so. As for A/G, I'm sorry but I'd rather have an F-15 with JDAM/JSOW/AGM-130/SLAM-ER over the SU with its Kh-31/KAB-1500s TV-guided bombs/FAB-500M62 dumb bombs/S-8 unguided rockets(which were offered to you lot) <strong>ANYDAY</strong>. To sum up, the Su30 is indeed the better of the Eagle in some aspects, but "in all its guises"? Forgive my language, but you're either hopelessly optimistic or blindingly stupid.<br><br>And then theres the F/A-18F. Again, would you prefer a full spec APG-70 AESA for the Eagle or the standard APG-73(same as on the F/A-18Ds) on offer to you for your Super Bugs? Again, hopelessly optimistic or blindingly stupid?<br><br>FYI the APG-79 AESA upgrade to the SuperBug comes much later and if your Dear Leader keeps mouthing off as he is now, I wonder if you lot will even be offered the Super Bugs, not to mention the APG-79 upgrade.<br><br>Seems like "too arrogant to accept the facts" is not a condition limited to us Southerners eh?</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>2002 Laureate Awards<br>ELECTRONICS<br>Aviation Week &amp; Space Technology<br>04/21/2003, page 38<br><br>Three years ago, the U.S. Navy/ Boeing/Raytheon APG-79 Active Electronically Scanned Array team began developing an advanced radar that would allow the F/A-18E/F to counter the evolving threat beyond 2020. Led by three program managers, Capt. (select) Dave Dunaway, Don Thole of Boeing and Tom Kennedy of Raytheon, the team has met every milestone since contract award in 2000, including 100% on-time delivery.<br><br>The APG-79 is the first completely new airborne fire control radar built by Raytheon in more than 25 years. It has an advanced active array, the next-generation receiver exciter and a brand-new fiber channel-based processor.<br><br>Top Pentagon officials say Active Electronically Scanned Array (AESA) radars eventually will be at the heart of the U.S.' network-centric defenses. These multi-element systems will contribute to many advanced capabilities. For example, AESA will allow stealth aircraft to use radar while still avoiding detection. In various forms, they eventually will be carried by the F/A-22 Raptor, F-35 Joint Strike Fighter, Unmanned Combat Air Vehicle (UCAV), B-2 and the Air Force's new E-10 multi-sensor command and control aircraft.<br><br>THE APG-79 PROMISES to be more lethal, survivable and reliable than any airborne fire control radar today. The Navy anticipates never having to open the nose of an aircraft to repair the radar. Its officials say they are putting a 12,000-hr. radar in a 6,000-hr. aircraft.<br><br>The APG-79 also provides "limitless choices" operationally, according to Dunaway, making the F/A-18E/F Super Hornet a far more capable precision-strike aircraft than its predecessors. The AESA radar makes the Super Hornet, now on operational duty in the Middle East, "more survivable, supportable and affordable," explained Thole.<br><br>During a Nov. 20 exercise, the team demonstrated the first fully integrated engineering manufacturing development model, three months ahead of schedule. The team completed Operational Test and Evaluation Phase IIA earlier this year and is on track for first flight test by June. The "leap-ahead" technology incorporated in the APG-79 is the basis for other major programs including MP-RTIP; the new, long-range ground surveillance radar for the E-10; and next-generation radars for the F-15 Eagle, B-2 and UCAV.<br><br>Dunaway is a U.S. Naval Academy graduate who became an F/A-18 pilot with VFA-151 and later a test pilot and test director. He received an M.S. in aerospace engineering from the U.S. Naval Postgraduate School. Dunaway is currently the Radar IPT lead and program manager for AESA.<br><br>Thole has worked at Boeing on F-4, F-15 and F/A-18 programs since the mid-1980s. Under his leadership, a Boeing/Raytheon team fielded USAF's F-15C AESA. Building on the F-15C radar upgrade experience, Thole is heading up the APG-79 development effort for Boeing.<br><br>Kennedy earned his B.S.E.E. at Rutgers University, M.S.E.E. at the Air Force Institute of Technology and Ph.D. at UCLA. Prior to joining Hughes Aircraft Co., he was a USAF captain. Kennedy is the Raytheon program manager for APG-79.<br><br>These program leaders are supported by hundreds of professionals who have made the APG-79 a success.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>In any case, I can almost smell that all bids for the Singapore NGF program will offer an AESA radar except probably Typhoon. Funny isn't it that Eurofight consortium market it as the best 4th gen aircraft and yet they are the slowest to introduce AESA - not until the Trenche 3 upgrade sometime in 2010 (I read).  In any case, I think they will offer this as an additional options for RSAF.<br><br></div>

I believe the SU-30 case cannot be treated easily.<br><br>The F-16 cant technologically match the Su-30. It will some how be inappropiate to match the F-16 to the SU-30 too. The SU-30 is an air superiority figther ( all of us should know ) , the F-16 is a multiple role fighter , how to match?? Very much , i believe our NGF will be one that can match the SU-30 ( Of course lah! ). So , F-16 Blk60 , Gripen and SuperHornet should be out. F-15 may be reluctantly in , with Rafale ( i frankly see nth special in that aircraft ) , Typhoon and the Su-30/35 in the selection league.<br><br>* I will frankly hope that we select the SU-30/35 together with another western aircraft ( Typhoons anyone? ), upgrade the Su-30/35 and look at the malaysians face.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"> Mr X: ''Look they are trying to be insensitive and unneighbourly again!!!!!''</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>aiyo, if we have to repeat our arguments 10,000 times, we're going to get sore throat pretty quickly... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>The comparison is between RSAF Vipers and the future RMAF SU 30MKMs are like comparing apples with oranges. However, all things being equal (eg. pilot are equally skilled, etc), our Vipers might not even lose out to the SU-30MKM in a BVR shoot out. As for WVR, the Sukhois do have advantages over Vipers in terms of super manoeuvrability but as many pilot will testifies, what the Sukhois pilot did in the air show (such as the cobra manoeuvre is impractical in ACM or Air combat Manoeuvre Â– bleeding too much energy in high AoA is a suicidal move especially when the opponent has HMS and off-bore sight missiles).  In actual fact before the Sukhois can position itself for a kill, a Python 4 might already be trailing it. DonÂ’t forget that both Python 4 and Sidewinders has head-on engagement capability. Phython 4 has off-bore sight up to 60 degree.  Thus, my argument is that in dogfights, Vipers might not necessary always lose. Of course, I will still give a higher kill ratio to the Sukhois. I will give an uneducated guess of a ration between 1:2 or 1:3 in Sukhois favourite.<br><br>Secondly, I believe that many of the posters here are young (Sec, JC, NS?) and do not have working experience ? No offence intended. There is always a misconception of measuring equipment purely based on some very specific technical qualities. DonÂ’t forget that air to air combat is a tough business. How good an aircraft is (in todayÂ’s term) is not purely based on their flight characteristics. In the past (WWII, Korean War, many air campaign fought between the IAF, Syrian and the Egyptian AF, and to some extend the Vietnam War), winning air-to-air combats were based on typical dogfight strategy of getting on the six of your enemies. Advancement of AAMs change this dramatically. No longer a more manoeuvrable aircraft will be taking all the winning steaks. It comes down to tactics and pilots skills. That is why fighter academies like Top Gun, teaches Navy pilots how to defeat enemies  using the huge and cumberson Tomcats. Tomcats is not very manoeuvrable compared to many of the aircraft they have downed without losing a single plane due to enemies aircraft. Tomcats shot down Su-22s, Mig 21s, etc.<br><br>Thus, being the most manoeuvrable aircraft does not always mean winning the air battles. It is only a small part of the equation. My view is the equation of determining possibility of winning Air to Air combat should be based on:<br><br>% A2A Win = advantage in agility of aircraft for WVR +<br>technological advantage in avionics (radar, HMS, electronics, etc) +<br>skill of pilot (tactics + situation alertness) +<br>situation alertness in entire battle area (AEW/AWACS/ Peer support) +<br>advantage in weapons (WVR/BVR) +<br>Â“good luckÂ”<br>___________________________<br>Â“bad luckÂ”<br><br></div>

The Falcon with EW suit , derby , HMS , Python missile can realli give a bloody nose ( as someone like to say ) to our neighbour's arm force. With unmatchable skills of our pilots , we sure have an upper hand.<br><br>However we must know that the F-16 is a multiple role fighter ,while the SU-30 is an air-superiority fighter. Their mission capability are different. As long as im concern , the SU-30 are built to neutralize the F-15E ( the mainstay of US air superiority ). The SU-30 are built to successfully engage any potential allied aircraft BVR or WVR. These objective can be seen by the powerful radar and Infrared sensor carried by the SU-30 , coupled with the R-77. The TVC engine , with HMS and R-73E.<br><br>I dare not say that the SU-30 are 100% able to neutralize our F-16 ,however at least the Su-30 are built to neutralize the F-16 , not the other way round.<br><br>There have not been any engagement between the F-16 and the SU-30 , and thats wat most of us ( i believe ) are afraid of. We dunno the true capability of the SU-30 ,but atleast with the technological suit of it. Theortically the SU-30 should be more capable than the F-16.<br><br>Anyway , our NGF project is a very good example. The SU-30/35 is in our contender list and we are happy abt that. Y would we want a fighter less capable that the F-16??? Of course u can say that the F-16 Blk60 is in the list too , the onli straight logic which i can think out to justify my stand is that there is no country in the world that use F-16 solely to deal with a threat magnitude of a SU-30.<br><br>Btw tripwire , dun be negative with my stand on the SU-30 being more capable theortically, however surely there are other transparent factors to be considered .</div>

Perhaps this will change your mind:<br><a href="http://www.defense-aerospace.com/data/sponsor_rafale/index.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.defense-aerospace.com/data/sponsor_rafale/index.htm</a><br><br>In fact, if you do more reading on Rafale, you will find that they are the equal most, if not the most, advanced fighter that come out from Europe right now. The growth path is there. The only real disadvantages (2 of them in my view) are:<br><br>1. No foreign sales. Very low local sales. Cost per unit is gonna be high. Darn, the Koreans should have gotten this one <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br><br>2. Very few Yankees weapon integrated to Rafale. RSAF will have to foot any development cost to integrate US and Israeli made weapons or targetting pods. Might not be that bad if Singapore can stomach it. Given the current economic circumstances, maybe not. However, ST Aero, DSTA, DSO will learn heaps in terms of avionics integration from the access to the source code.<br><br>On the other hand, Rafale has the advantage of:<br>1. Non US made, possibly mean RSAF can get the current best BVR (Mica) to go with.<br><br>2. Rafale will too be equipped with an AESA. Like the US AESA, it will be very impressive in many aspect which I am not going to dwell in for the time being.<br><br>3. Rafale ECM suite - superb. Even the Yankees are impressed. US will never release an equivalent on their Superbugs.<br><br>4. Eurofight is still lacking behind in terms of their availability of the latest technologies plus their delivery schedule.<br><br>5. agility better than Superbugs  - tested and proven in ACM training between French navy and US navy. Supercruise at Mach 1.1, good range with CFT (will be able to travel much further than Superbug, but will compare less favourably against the Eagles).<br><br>6. Stealth second to F22 and F35.

RSAF cannot afford to purchase 2 different types. Simply bad for logistics. Furthermore, would we seriously want to test our patience with the supply chain issue that plague our northern neighbour?<br></div>

We may be pals with US now and arms export controls are relaxed, but can we say for sure future admiistrations will be so friendly to us?<br><br>- Superiority of the MICA vs the AMRAAM<br><br>- Rafale is a newer design, more scope for development<br><br>- Stealthiness. Rafale wins over all the others in the RSAF NGF competition by a mile.<br><br>- A realistic schedule for entry into service vis-a-vi Typhoon, especially for the A/G versions<br><br>I'd like to know where did you get your info that the F-16D EW suite is the equal of Rafale. Firstly, no one knows a lot about the RSAF F-16D suite, and secondly, the general consensus(even among Americans) is that the Rafale EW system is the best among all the modern fighters<br><br>I think that the general consensus here is that on a head-to-head capabilities fight, the Rafale will beat the Yanks hands down while just shading the Typhoon(I've yet to be convinced by YourFather and the other pro-Typhoon forummites). Unfortunately its never about pure capabilities in competitions like this, and it looks increasingly likely to me that in this post-Sept 11, post-Operation Iraqi Freedom world, our decision would be in favour of a US design(my bet is on the Strike Eagle derivative). Which is a real pity, with all due respect to the Eagle.</div>

In terms of max range, AMRAAM wins flat out. But even the Americans acknowledge that AMRAAM kill probability is VERY LOW at max range due to poor agility especially at long range. Case in point, Dutch F-16 kill of Serbian MiG-29 over Kosovo 1999, 3 AMRAAMs were launched, 3rd one hit after MiG ran out of energy to defeat AMRAAMs after first 2 were dodged.<br><br>Range specs quoted for MICA is range where missile achieves 90%(or 75% I can't remember) PK against a hard-manuvering target.<br><br>Reason for poor AMRAAM performance at long range? Look at the missile, to maximise range the missile was fitted with small(ie less draggy) fins, however the corresponding trade off was manuverability, especially at long range where missile energy is already low<br><br>BTW I'm happy to continue debating about the missiles, but I agree with foxtrout that the NGF discussion should cease. Done to death liao. Thats why I didn't want to post detailed arguments in my previous post.</div>
