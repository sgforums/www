He is on a three-day official visit and is scheduled to call on Defence Minister Datuk Seri Najib Tun Razak at Wisma Pertahanan tomorrow.<br><br>"This is a positive indication that the Su-30 is the choice for the Royal Malaysian Air Force," the observers told the New Straits Times.<br><br>A Russian Embassy spokesman said the minister's visit was at Najib's invitation and several meetings have been scheduled over the next two days.<br><br>They are the fifth Malaysia-Russia joint committee on defence co-oper-ation and the third Malaysia-Russia defence industry co-operation (working group).<br><br>On whether there would be any announcement on military hardware procurement, specifically fighter jets, the spokesman said: "Any announcement would be made at the appropriate occasion." For the past three years, Russia's State Corporation Â¡X Rosoboronexport Â¡X had made available various variants of the aircraft for the Government to evaluate.<br><br>The Sukhoi MKM is a variant of the Flanker customised to Malaysian specifications. A similar variant, the Su-30MKI, is currently in use by the Indian Air Force.<br><br>Sources disclosed that another item expected to be discussed is the scheduled visit of Russian President Vladimir Putin.<br><br>"While dates are tentative, plans are under way to schedule the visit before October," the sources said.<br><br>On the purchase of the Flanker, the sources confirmed that the air-craft was under evaluation by the Defence Ministry. The proposal to buy the Sukhoi Su30MK was made in the 1990s but shelved due to the Asian financial crisis.<br><br>Revived three years ago, it was the second arms procurement negotiated on barter trade terms between the two countries.<br><br>In 1994, Malaysia purchased 18 MiG-29 Fulcrum fighter jets for a total of US$600 million (RM2,280 million). Besides the MiG-29, USmanufactured F/A-18D Hornets are also in service with the air force.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>My take on the F/A-18 Super Hornets:<br><br>Don't think that with Mahatir's recent tirade against the US, he will "allow" the government to procure the Superbugs, at least when he is still in office. Although he will reportedly step down in Oct, the sale will probably not happen, until after next year's UMNO elections.<br><br>I am pretty sure that Boeing and the US are very eager to sell the Superbugs to Malaysia for $$$, regardless of sentiment.<br><br>US$900 million for 18 SU-30MKM translates to US$50 million per plane - probably including spares/weaponry.<br><br>Cheap? Expensive? You decide.</div>

Besides, its a never ending story that benefits the arms suppliers only. Imagine, a year from now when Singapore decides on its next fighter aircraft replacement, the forums will be flooded with comments, and the cycle continues right? Isn't the MAF's objective to prevent a war as well?</div>

Let him gloat <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile">  I mean, he's hadn't have the chance to gloat since god knows when... Only recently has he got the chance to do so.... We just wait for our turn....<br><br>My comments on this purchase? I'd rather Singapore face SU-30MKMs than F-18Fs. (I gotta admit, I think I underestimated the F-18F's capability by quite a bit... ) The SU-30MKMs are a formidable opponent, but definitely NOT unbeatable by F-16s..... (remember, plane comparisons are good academic talking points, but when you get to fighting a war, you are fighting the air force as a whole SYSTEM, and we got a much, more rounded, well thought out air force than theirs....)<br><br>And of course, speaking of the air force as a system.... I heard their application requirements for air force technicians and engineers were lowered because those who qualified were applying for officer course instead ( officer qualification requirements not much more than air force technician requirements... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"> ) So now they are accepting lower qualified technicains ( Maybe even gotta teach them English first before can start technician course, alamak, jialat sia <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"> )..... So you see, they can get airplanes, but actually having them work and integrating them into the air force to become a contributing FORCE ain't that easy.....<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hi people,<br><br>I think before we start a flame war across the (Johor) straits, lets examine what this purchase implies in terms of<br>1. balance of power in the region<br>2. RSAF responses<br>3. RTAF responses<br>etc.<br><br>I think there are a few things we can learn from this purchase, one being that Malaysians (and Indonesians) are more willingly to purchase Russian made equipments regardless of logistical issues.<br>On paper, SU 30 MK series version is very potent. It has all the flight characteristics of the SU27 plus the additional thrust vectoring... (cannot confirm if this is true on the RMAF MKM version but certainly true on the Indian MKI version). The avionics suite may also include the French Thales stuffs. All these make the aircraft the most sophisticated fighter in the region.<br><br>So the question now is "What will the 18 SU-30 MKM do to the balance of power in the SEA region?" My guess is that, all of a sudden, you will see RMAF sticking a claim to be the most advanced air-force in the region. They would probably claim that they are equal if not better than both RSAF and RTAF.<br><br>So what will be the responses from these two air-forces? I don't really know. But as for RSAF, the next generation fighter, presumedly a Euro canard, should theoretically match, if not better the SU-30. Both RSAF and RTAF Vipers, in my view, can still be upgraded with the latest Active Array radars, request US to release the Amraams and match the SUs in BVR shoot outs. I also believe that Vipers can still hold their own, when properly employed, in dogfights. I also see the needs of RSAF to give each Viper a targeting pod in the form of either the Israeli made Litening II/III or the Sniper XR pod.<br><br>I also believe that the skills of the pilots, plus the logisitic maintenance of the aircrafts will determine who is stronger at the end of the day.<br><br>For RMAF to acquire, firstly the Mig29, then the F-18Ds, then now the Su-30, and later the F-18E/Fs, not to forget the Hawks too, man oh man, it will definitely be a logistical nightmare.<br><br>On the other hand, I also see the needs for RSAF to carefully choose the next gen fighter. I would say that Rafales and Typhoons would be my choice given that the Strike Eagles and the Super bugs do not present much advantage over the Sukhois.<br><br>Just my 2 cents.</div>
