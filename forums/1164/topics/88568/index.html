This round looks like scaled downt 5.56mm NATO round and forces the pointed, steel core bullet to the 600-700 meters per second at the muzzle, thus being capable to defeat standart CRISAT helmets and armour vests at reasonable distances (50-100 meters).<br><br>The P90 is a blowback operated, selective fire weapon. It is fed from 50-rounds box magazines, made from transluscent polymer. The magazine is being located above the barrel, with the cartridges being aligned at 90 degrees to the barrel axis. Each magazine has built-in ramp that rotates cartridge to align it with the barrel prior to chambering it.<br><br>The P90 controls are completely ambidextrous, with charging handles located at the both sides of the weapon, and the safety/fire mode selector is located below the trigger. The P90 also features downward ejection of the spent cases. P90 is built in bull-pup configuration, with polymer stock, and features built-in reflex collimator sight with 1X magnification and reticle automaticaly ajustable to the light level, as well as a set of the backup open sights. P90 may be equipped with special silencer, that should be used with special, sub-sonic variant of the 5.7x28mm cartridge.<br><br>P90 may be referred as a forerunner of the PDW (Personal Defence Weapon) concept, that arose in last 4 or 5 years.<br><br>P90 is used by Saudi Arabia, Peruan Special Forces and some special units of Thailand army, and offered for export by FN.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>just add another plus point about the P90 - with the silencer on, it is <strong>really</strong> silent - the sounds of the empty cartridges hitting the ground make more noise than the actual firing. first hand experience. for comparison, i've heard that the suppressed mp5 on the other hand, is not actually very silent.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Yup,the MP5SD series SMGs have their silencers integrated into the barrel of the weapon itself,as such it is quieter compared to other weapons where the silencer is fixed onto the weapon.<br><br>Comparing the FN P90,with the H&amp;K MP5,its a pretty close fight as both weapons have their pros and cons.The P90 has a higher calibre,higher velocity round the 5.7mm and has a longer magazine containing 50 shots.Whil the tried and tested H&amp;K MP5 series of weapons is compact,stable,reliable and fires from a closed-bolt position,this allows the weapon to be fired very very accurately.<br><br>The P90 does have a flaw in the sense that it is very expensive,and has a uniquely strange "turn-table"of sorts in the magazine where the round will execute a 90 degrees turn before being loaded into the chamber.However,though this seems like a long process compared to the normal style of feeding,the P90 can unleash rounds faster then the MP5 can.<br><br>Thus it is usually up to the individual user of the weapon to see what suits his operation.Btw,during the Thai Hospital Raid a couple of years back,Thai SF were even using the standard M-16A1 to assault the building.Thus,it can be seen that its not the equipment you use,but rather the way you have been trained that really matters.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>if u all mean the Aluminium silencer for MP-5, it can't compare with the in-built one loh....its a hell of a dif...P90 allows a driver to shoot with just a hand so dat they can still drive when shooting. the design and size allows P90 to be placed between the driver seat and door, u caan even put it in the mappocket of the cardoor itself. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>P90 is very good...almost on par with MP-5.</div>
