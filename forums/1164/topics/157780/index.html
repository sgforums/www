            <div class='col-md body'>Defence Diplomacy?? Sounds a bit strange... Wouldn't Defence Policy be a more accurate term?<br><br>Which university are u doing this project for?<br><br>RSAF is dependent of US hardware true.  But, since US is one of our chief defence partners, it is an advantage to use equipment that is interoperable with the US.<br><br>Some feel that being too reliant on US hardware and weapons might be disadvantageous to us should the US decide to stop transfering arms to us.  We might be left high n dry. However, I believe our government is keen on maintaining close and friendly relations with the US.  This relation would hopefully would continue to allow us to purchase equipment from them, from administration to administration.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Too much of a good thing is never good.<br><br>The basis of our defence diplomacy is "my Enemy's enemy is a friend". This tied to our need for defence technology, training areas and ready markets for our products has made us travel far and wide, we have strange bed fellows as friends.<br><br>The obvious friends in need: Brunei, Indonesia and Taiwan provide for all these last two 'needs'. On a more limited role is Thailand for training and limited markets. India and Australia provide training space. Whilst USA, Sweden, Germany(?), UK and France provide technology and training.<br><br>Israel provides technology solely (obvious). Special mention is Myanmar which is buyer of some of our products.  All these partners we keep 'sweet' but silent.<br><br>So what's the flip side?<br><br>What happens when an international issue has some friends on one side and others on the opposite side? Singapore's diplomats will have a ball of a time to keep the sides separate and walk the thin line between.<br><br>We have been very successful by being netural and being an umpire for issues which we ourselves have little/no stake (i.e. as chair for discussions on G8 agri policies etc).<br><br>How then? "Walk the walk", "talk the talk", Carry a big stick and hope it never comes to blows.<br><br></div>

If you look at it closely all countries are like Singapore, also depends on one of the 3 for majors arms like planes, which is no no choice option.<br><br>But we must take note that singapore has build up technology to upgrade and service its own planes, and able to work with other companies to intergrate other systems into our planes.<br><br></div>
