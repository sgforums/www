The convoy is to stop for up to a week while the food and the fuel, the bullets and the bombs catch them up.<br><br>Captain Matthew Kolich says: "It's just that we moved a long way from Kuwait and our supply lines are stretched.<br><br>"We're just making sure that we have the right pieces in place to make it all the way to Baghdad."<br><br>Under attack<br><br>And all this while the Marines have been coming under constant ambush from small but determined groups of Iraqi fighters.<br><br>Some of these men have been out in the desert for many weeks and are keen to get back to family, friends and loved ones.<br><br>They are kicking their heels in the desert and just want to "get on with the job" as they put it.<br><br>It's a sign of the nervousness here that a group of Marines opened fire on a civilian vehicle after hearing what they thought was a gunshot. Later, it emerged that the car had simply backfired.<br><br>All three occupants were killed.<br><br>It is hoped that this massive convoy will soon be on the move again.<br><br>But for now the world's most powerful army is regrouping, its confidence dented, the march on Baghdad currently on hold.<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;"><br>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>Reporters with the US and British military are restricted in what they can say about precise locations or military plans.<br></span></div>

They've said if you put this kit on you won't get shot.<br><br>"We can identify a friendly vehicle from 1,500 metres [4,921 ft].<br><br>"You've got an A-10 with advanced technology and he can't use a thermal sight to identify whether a tank is a friend or foe. It's ridiculous.<br><br>"Combat is what I've been trained for. I can command my vehicle. I can keep it from being attacked.<br><br>"What I have not been trained to do is look over my shoulder to see whether an American is shooting at me."<br><br>The two Scimitars, followed by two armoured engineers' vehicles and another Scimitar light tank, set out on a "recce" of a road north west of Ad Dayr, north of Basra in southern Iraq, on Friday.<br><br>After coming under fire from Iraqi artillery, they were instructed to investigate a shanty town.<br><br>Troop leader Lieutenant MacEwen, 25, with special plastic bags now tied around his hands to treat his burns, described how the convoy tensed as villagers waving white flags approached from behind a large bank on the marshland by the Shatt al-Arab river.<br><br>"You could see the white flags above the bank but you didn't know whether they had any intention of surrendering or ambushing us," he said.<br><br>White light<br><br>Lance Corporal Gerrard said he suddenly heard the distinctive, relentless roar of an A-10's anti-tank gunfire.<br><br>"I will never forget that noise as long as I live. It is a noise I never want to hear again," he said<br><br>"There was no gap between the bullets. I heard it and I froze. The next thing I knew the turret was erupting with white light everywhere, heat and smoke.<br><br>"I felt I was going to burn to death. I just shouted 'reverse, reverse, reverse'.<br><br>"My gunner was screaming 'get out, get out'. How I got out of that hole I don't know. Then I saw the A-10 coming again and I just ran."<br><br>Lying on his hospital bed, he said the A-10 circled and made a return attack run.<br><br>"On the back of one of the engineers' vehicles there was a Union Jack," he said.<br><br>"For him to fire his weapons I believe he had to look through his magnified optics. How he could not see that Union Jack I don't know."<br><br>Tempting fate<br><br>The front two Scimitars, packed with hundreds of rounds of ammunition, grenades, rifle rounds and flammable diesel fuel tanks, exploded into flames.<br><br>One of the soldiers' colleagues, Lance Corporal of Horse Matty Hull, did not escape the explosion<br>Lance Corporal Gerrard also criticised the pilot for shooting when there were civilians so close to the tanks.<br><br>"There was a boy of about 12-years-old. He was no more than 20 metres [65.6 ft] away when the Yank opened up. There were all these civilians around.<br><br>"He [the pilot] had absolutely no regard for human life. I believe he was a cowboy. He'd just gone out on a jolly."<br><br>He added: "I'm curious about what's going to happen to the pilot.<br><br>"He's killed one of my friends and he's killed him on the second run."<br><br>Trooper Finney, who was hit in the leg when the A-10 made its second attack, said all the British soldiers and their families joked about "friendly fire".<br><br>He said: "I got a letter off my dad the day before the attack and it said 'Be careful, come home soon and watch out for those damn Yanks'.<br><br>"Looks like he tempted fate a bit there."<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">This is pooled copy from Patrick Barkham of the Times on RFA Argus in the Gulf. </span></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>BBC News Complains About Pentagon Control of the News: Getting More Truth From Baghdad<br><br>March 29, 2003<br><br>By Julie Hyland WSWS.org<br><br>An unnamed "senior BBC news source", cited by the Guardian, went further, stating: "We're getting more truth out of Baghdad than the Pentagon at the moment."<br><br>The BBC has become so concerned at false and misleading information being put out on the war against Iraq that it has stressed to its journalists that they must clearly attribute military sources.<br><br>According to the Guardian, BBC news chiefs met to discuss the problem after the broadcaster carried several reports later shown to be inaccurate. The misleading reports were all favourable to the US/UK forces and so their exposure has undermined the BBC's claims to be providing unbiased coverage.<br><br>On Sunday March 23, British military sources claimed to have taken the port of Umm Qasr in southern Iraq. Three days later, they were still fighting to quell resistance.<br><br>The BBC then ran headlines with reports of the discovering of a chemical weapons factory in An Najaf, which was later dropped.<br><br>On Tuesday, March 25, the British news was filled with reports of an uprising under way in Basra, Iraq's second largest city. Claims of the 'popular uprising' were first made by British military forces, but were later found to be untrue.<br><br>On Wednesday, March 26, the British military were cited reporting that 'up to 120 tanks' were leaving Basra. The convoy was later found to be just three-strong.<br><br>Numerous other examples can be cited, including the continuous downplaying of the extent of popular opposition to the US/UK invasion and the particularly cynical claim that the Iraqi regime was responsible for the missile attack on a Baghdad market that killed 17 civilians.<br><br>A BBC spokeswoman confirmed that a meeting had been held to discuss recent events.<br><br>"There's been a discussion about attribution and it's been reinforced with people that we do have to attribute military information," she said. "We have to be very careful in the midst of a conflict like this one to be very sure when we're reporting something we've not seen with our own eyes that we attribute it."<br><br>An unnamed "senior BBC news source", cited by the Guardian, went further, stating: "We're getting more truth out of Baghdad than the Pentagon at the moment."<br><br>"We're absolutely sick and tired of putting things out and finding they're not true. The misinformation in this war is far and away worse than any conflict I've covered, including the first Gulf war and Kosovo."<br><br>Many news sources in Britain are now admitting that much of the key information they are relaying has been proven to be inaccurate. But this is often put down to the pressures of 24- hour coverage and the 'fog of war'. For example, the BBC source cited by the Guardian went on to claim that the misinformation was an accident, rather than deliberate deceit: "I don't know whether they [the Pentagon] are putting out flyers in the hope that we'll run them first and ask questions later or whether they genuinely don't know what's going on? I rather suspect the latter."<br><br>In truth, much of the British and US media is simply a propaganda tool of their respective military forces. Some 900 journalists and reporters are "embedded" with US/UK troops, effectively functioning as part of an act of armed aggression against the Iraqi people and paid to conceal that fact. The concern expressed by the BBC's top brass is that this fact has become so obvious to millions in Britain and around the world that its own credibility - and hence its considerable political influence internationally - will never recover.<br><br></div>
