            <div class='col-md body'>Its sad when some kid walks over a landmine, blows his leg off. Its even more sad when the mine was laid over 30 years ago, by former enemies.  Unexploded munitions such as landmines and bombs are just a faint reminder of the consequences of war.  It not only kills the soldiers in it, it also kills their children, and their children's children.  Today, France, Germany as well as other European countries are still busy digging up and disposing of allied bombs that used to rain on their cities more than 60 years ago.<br><br>However, given Singapore's position.  I sympathise with the need for counter-mobility weapons such as mines.  If the situation arises where we need to slow our opponents down, I'd use the mines and worry about the consequences later.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Smart mine technology would make landmines a viable weapon. But for now it's deploying them almost always results in disaster, to observe basic facts, how many modern day crackpot military commanders bother to use mines properly? The idea that not restricting their deployment because a minoirity of militaries use them with responsibility is overly-utopic. Just go to cambodia.</div>
