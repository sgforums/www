            <div class='col-md body'>I doubt the SAF is replacing the FH2000. They have been in service for less than a decade! It would be more plausible if the FH-88 are to be upgraded to the same standard as the FH2000 and then replace the M71S gradually. That way, we just have the FH2000 as std arty gun, with the new Self Propelled Howitzer and the LG105 supplementing.  [/quote]</div>

The current M113 120mm mortar carriers provide very little protection to the guys from counter battery and small arm fires. SAF could perhaps replace current SP mortars on M113 with the AMOS systems mounted on Terrex AV81, M113 or Bionix which provide not only protection but also a higher rate of fire given that each of the AMOS system has 2 barrels. Second addition I can think of is to have the ST Engg BRONCO ATTC carrying the 120mm Super Rapid Advanced Mortar System.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by Joe Black:</div><div class="quote_body">Well, if the (long overdue) direction is to give arty protected SP platforms, then I also believe that should extend to the SP mortars. The current M113 120mm mortar carriers provide very little protection to the guys from counter battery and small arm fires. SAF could perhaps replace current SP mortars on M113 with the AMOS systems mounted on Terrex AV81, M113 or Bionix which provide not only protection but also a higher rate of fire given that each of the AMOS system has 2 barrels. Second addition I can think of is to have the ST Engg BRONCO ATTC carrying the 120mm Super Rapid Advanced Mortar System.<br></div></blockquote>Good thoughts on the M113 120 SP mortar. The problem is, 155 gunners are more susceptible to counterbattery fire than mortarmen. It takes less than 2 mins to get the first shot out of the tubes; it takes abt 5 mins for gunners to crank off the first shot. To shoot and scoot? The SP mortar carrier can leave its engine running and be gone after the first shot long before the first enemy arty round hits you. Alll this, of cos' is without camouflage net cover for both mortar and 155 gun.<br><br>But I agree with you on the need to reequip with the Super Rapid Advanced Mortar System (SRAMS). Just not on the Bronco. It's a poor firing platform. The stability isn't good  or wide enough. Plus, a towed SRAMS system has to manoever forever before it actually gets the correct "reading position". It's even harder to traverse the system. Additionally, the essence of an SP mortar carrier is its self-containment; ability to fire from within the vehicle without having to transport rounds on an external carrier. In fact, ability to operate within the vehicle without having to leave,with the exception of having to plant the firing poles. I guess the SRAMS would be best suited if it were mounted on the M113 chassis again.<br><br>My 2 cents...<br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"><br><br>Action Front!!</div>

I'm just wondering the level of armour protection on an SRAMS Bronco though...Bionix FSV might be a better choice.</div>
