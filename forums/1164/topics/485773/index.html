              <h1>BRICS against Dollar Dominance or the US as Global Stronghold of Evil</h1>
              <p><strong><a class="black" href="http://www.strategic-culture.org/authors/nil-nikandrov.html">Nil NIKANDROV</a></strong> | 18.07.2014 | 00:00</p>
              <p style="text-align: justify;">The process of bloody globalization going on a rampage is slowly 
              becoming a thing of the past as raw awakening is gradually stepping in. 
              The US blitzkrieg aimed at achieving global dominance controlled by 
              Washington under the slogan of «unipolar democracy» is seen as a failure
               by the rest of the world. But the administration of Obama is not ready 
              to concede defeat and continues to be seeking pretexts to start wars 
              using provocations and black propaganda to create the images of 
              enemies. </p>
              <p style="text-align: justify;">Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa – the countries which 
              make up the group of BRICS drastically change the contemporary world. 
              One of the trends is doing away with the financial system that emerged 
              after the Second World War. BRICS wants to put an end to the dollar 
              dominance or the use of green funny money to buy everything that has 
              material value accompanied by constant cheating on the part of the 
              United States. </p>
              <p style="text-align: justify;">Speaking at the VI BRICS summit in Brasilia (July 15-16), President 
              Vladimir Putin said the reform of international financial-currency 
              system has become ripe since a long time ago because it was putting the 
              group at disadvantage and hindering the progress of new world economies,
               «In the BRICS case we see a whole set of coinciding strategic 
              interests. First of all, this is the common intention to reform the 
              international monetary and financial system. In the present form it is 
              unjust to the BRICS countries and to new economies in general. We should
               take a more active part in the IMF and the World Bank's decision-making
               system. The international monetary system itself depends a lot on the 
              US dollar, or, to be precise, on the monetary and financial policy of 
              the US authorities. The BRICS countries want to change this». There is 
              an urgent need to include BRICS as an equal partner into the decision 
              making process of the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank. </p>
              <p style="text-align: justify;">In Fortaleza BRICS signed the Declaration and Joint Plan of Action. The
               declaration reflects the common vision of contemporary political and 
              economic situation in the world and defines the plans of further 
              cooperation. The plan sets the missions to carry out till the next 
              summit to take place in Russia in 2015. All global media outlets 
              reported about the setup of the New Development Bank (NDB) with the 
              headquarters in Shanghai and the $100 billion BRICS contingency reserve 
              arrangement (CRA) will be raised from the member countries’ central bank
               reserves while capital for the group’s development bank will come from 
              national budgets. According to President Putin, «BRICS Bank will be one 
              of the major multilateral development finance institutions in this 
              world.» «In terms of escalating international competition the task of 
              activating the trade and investment cooperation between BRICS member 
              states becomes important,» the Russian leader said. </p>
              <p style="text-align: justify;">Bringing emerging economies closer has become vital at a time when the 
              world is guttered by the financial crisis and BRICS countries can’t 
              remain above international problems, said Brazil's President Dilma 
              Rousseff. She cautioned the world not to see BRICS deals as a desire to 
              dominate. «We want justice and equal rights,» she said. «The IMF should 
              urgently revise distribution of voting rights to reflect the importance 
              of emerging economies globally,» Rousseff said. According to the 
              Brazilian President, the group has to great extent mitigated the 
              negative impact of the global crisis on world finances and the economic 
              growth. The creation of the new development Bank and the BRICS 
              contingency reserve arrangement (CRA) shows that no matter cultural, 
              ethnic and linguistic differences exist, the group is ready to create a 
              sound and positive strategic alliance to counter instability on 
              international arena. Dilma Rousseff emphasizes that the group has 
              emerged not to get together against anyone but to serve its own 
              interests. She believes BRICS facilitates the prosperity of the planet. </p>
              <p style="text-align: justify;">The five BRICS countries represent almost 3 billion people with a 
              combined nominal GDP of US$16.039 trillion and an estimated US$4 
              trillion in combined foreign reserves. As of 2014, the BRICS nations 
              represented 21 percent of the world economy. The BRICS countries now 
              account for 11% of global capital investment, and trade turnover almost 
              doubled in the last 5 years. The trade turnover inside the group has 
              doubled in recent years and it’s just a start. The Russian experts have 
              prepared the BRICS Strategy for Economic Cooperation. Its implementation
               will let he group gain the leading positions in the world economy. </p>
              <p style="text-align: justify;">A BRICS-UNASUR (the Union of South American Nations) summit also took 
              place. Anti-BRICS propaganda had predicted the participation of only 
              «populist leaders» – Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro, Ecuadoran 
              leader Rafael Correa, the President of Bolivia Evo Morales and, perhaps,
               «eccentric» sometime President of Uruguay Jose Mujica. Instead, all 
              South American leaders came to Brazil to personally see the BRICS heads 
              of states and get the information about the group’s activities 
              firsthand. Trade and economy topped the agenda. South America wants to 
              get the most from its contacts with the «Big Five». </p>
              <p style="text-align: justify;">President Maduro said the summit was to protect the multipolar world. 
              In Venezuela the concept is reflected in the state policy set forth in 
              Venezuela's Second Socialist Plan of the Nation 2013-2019, or Homeland 
              Plan. The goal is to ensure the influx of petrodollars required for the 
              country's socioeconomic development without compromising the maximum oil
               recovery in the long term. The document has been approved by the 
              National Assembly. The Venezuelan leader believes his country needs a 
              new economic order to be created by Latin Americans on their own 
              continent. He said the meeting was of historic importance getting 
              together the South Americans to choose their own way of development and 
              the five most fast-growing nations in the world. </p>
              <p style="text-align: justify;">There were bilateral meetings with South American counterparts. 
              Vladimir Putin held fruitful talks with the presidents of Bolivia, 
              Uruguay and Venezuela. </p>
              <p style="text-align: justify;">Washington used the issue of Ukraine to intensify the propaganda 
              campaign against Russia against the background of BRICS-UNASUR summit. 
              Earlier on July 15 Obama urged EU envoys to impose tougher measures 
              against Russia. In case the EU leaders refuse to adopt new sanctions, 
              the White House would act unilaterally. The ambassadors of the European 
              Union were invited to the White House. The US exerted hard pressure to 
              make European countries adopt tough measures against Russia to «punish 
              it for the aggression». The new sanctions, the first so-called «sectoral
               sanctions» used by the U.S. against Russia, hit a number of banks, 
              like, for instance: OAO Gazprombank and VEB and some Russian energy 
              firms, like OAO Novatek, Rosneft, Kalashnikov limiting their access to 
              the United States’ capital markets. Some high standing officials are 
              also on the list. Even before the announcement of the sanctions Foreign 
              Affairs Sergey Lavrov commented on July 15, «It is sad that the 
              president of the great power approaches such issues from such a 
              position,» he told reporters. «I’d like to mention as well that all the 
              BRICS leaders stressed that by condemning unilateral actions in the 
              global politics they do not seek confrontation, but on the contrary 
              advocate joint efforts with the participation of all the great powers 
              that would try to find a mutually acceptable solution to various 
              problems,» the Russian diplomat added. In this connection Sergey Lavrov 
              referred to the words of President Vladimir Putin who was speaking about
               the positive experience of the cooperation on the Syrian issue during 
              the meeting with the BRICS leaders earlier on July 14. «That is why we 
              should, probably, take a philosophical approach to every problem, but we
               oppose unilateral actions and emotions with the reason and pragmatism»,
               the Minister said. </p>
              <p style="text-align: justify;">BRICS and the majority of UNASUR members are critical towards the US 
              sanctions. The media reports and bloggers’ posts say Washington pursues 
              just one goal – to aggravate the situation at the Russia-Ukraine border 
              and pour fuel on the fire of the conflict with the help of the 
              US-controlled government of Poroshenko. Obama stresses the US has a 
              special role to play in finding solutions to such conflicts. </p>
              <p style="text-align: justify;">Has any such problem been solved by the United States during, say, the 
              recent 25 years? Devastated countries, thousands dead, hundreds of 
              assassinated politicians and military leaders who have not met the 
              standards of the US-style democracy which is the only one that is 
              genuine, is it not the egregious irresponsibility? Normal people are 
              scared by the US strong desire to create Pax Americana on the ruins of 
              other, more ancient and in a way, more perfect civilizations? It is 
              rejected even by the closest allies of the empire. Reasonable leaders 
              watch with concern the irrevocable of the United States turning into the
               global center of evil.</p>

              <div class="text section">
              <p>During the 1997–98 Asian financial crisis, when middle-income 
              countries were hard hit by big capital outflows, there was an effort by 
              China, Japan, Taiwan and other countries to put together an Asian 
              Monetary Fund to offer balance of payments support. <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/1997/11/20/business/asian-nations-affirm-imf-as-primary-provider-of-aid.html">Washington vetoed the idea</a>, insisting that all assistance had to go through the International Monetary Fund. The <a href="http://www.cepr.net/index.php/publications/reports/ten-years-after-the-lasting-impact-of-the-asian-financial-crisis/">result was a mess</a>,
               including an unnecessarily deep regional recession, as the IMF failed 
              to act as a lender of last resort and then attached all kinds of harmful
               and unnecessary conditions to its lending.</p>
              <p>But the world has changed a lot in the past 15 years. Last week the 
              BRICS countries (Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa) decided 
              to form the Contingent Reserve Arrangement (CRA) and the New Development
               Bank (NDB), and the United States will not have a veto this time. These
               new institutions could mark a turning point for the international 
              financial system.</p>
              <p>Western media coverage of these developments has been mostly 
              dismissive, but that primarily reflects the concerns of Washington and 
              its allies. They have had unchallenged sway over the decision-making 
              institutions of global financial governance for 70 years, and the last 
              thing they want to see is competition. But competition is exactly what 
              the world needs here.</p>
              <p>The IMF and the World Bank were created in 1944, when the United 
              States was pretty much the only standing industrial power in the world. 
              The institutions mirrored that unipolar reality. Today Washington still 
              controls both institutions, with the subordinate partnership of a 
              handful of rich allies; the same is true for the G-7, G-8 and G-20. In 
              recent years, as the eurozone has become the recipient of most IMF 
              lending, the European directors have, of course, been given the 
              predominant voice on policies in this region, but it’s still the same 
              group of countries in charge. And even in the World Trade Organization, 
              which was formed in 1995 and has a different consensual process, the 
              founding rules were written by the rich countries — and in this case, 
              especially <a href="https://www.citizen.org/documents/IntroForWeb.pdf">their corporations</a>. </p>
              <div class="text section">
              <p>For decades there have been efforts to give the majority of the 
              world’s nations a voice at the IMF and the World Bank, but progress has <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/cifamerica/2011/may/19/imf-dominique-strauss-kahn">been glacial at best</a>. The BRICS countries have more than 40 percent of the world’s population, and China is <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2014/may/03/world-nothing-fear-us-power-china-economy-democracy">now the world’s largest economy</a>, but they have almost no voice at either institution. To say that an alternative has been long overdue is an understatement.</p>
              <p>The BRICS NDB has gotten the most attention, but the $100 billion 
              currency reserve fund could prove a much bigger breakthrough. For most 
              countries, one of the biggest constraints and sources of potential 
              instability is the balance of payments. They must have enough dollars or
               other hard currency to finance imports and enough international 
              reserves to insure against a panicked flight from their currency. 
              Otherwise, their economies can fall into a crisis, a recession or other 
              devastating economic imbalance. Most of the damage from the Asian 
              financial crisis might have been prevented with timely balance of 
              payments support.</p>
              <p>But the harmful macroeconomic conditions attached to IMF lending have
               continued. Just look at Ukraine, where the economy is shrinking by 5 
              percent this year and the <a href="http://america.aljazeera.com/opinions/2014/5/ukraine-economy-imfeuropeanunionrussia.html">IMF is imposing austerity</a> that will prolong and possibly deepen the recession. An examination of 
              IMF policies during the global recession of 2009 showed that <a href="http://www.cepr.net/index.php/press-releases/press-releases/imf-agreements-with-41-borrowing-countries/">31 of 41 countries</a> with IMF agreements were subjected to pro-cyclical macroeconomic 
              policies — that is, policies that could be expected to worsen an 
              economic downturn or impede recovery. And although the IMF is only the 
              junior partner in the troika, with the European Central Bank and 
              European Commission, together they have dragged Europe through <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2014/jan/16/why-the-european-economy-is-worse">years of unnecessary recession</a> and the collective punishment of mass unemployment, and that has hurt 
              most of the global economy — including the BRICS and other developing 
              countries.</p>
              <p>The BRICS’ defection is part of a process that has been <a href="http://www.cepr.net/index.php/op-eds-&amp;-columns/op-eds-&amp;-columns/the-imf-has-lost-its-influence/">taking place</a> over the past 15 years, in which middle-income countries have 
              accumulated sufficient reserves to vote with their feet and break out of
               the IMF’s orbit. Although most economists and most of the major media 
              have ignored it, the IMF’s loss of influence over economic policy in 
              most middle-income countries is one of the most important developments 
              in the international financial system in the past half-century. It has 
              almost certainly contributed to the <a href="http://www.cepr.net/index.php/publications/reports/the-scorecard-on-development-1960-2010-closing-the-gap">rebound of economic growth</a> in most developing countries over the past decade. It is also, not 
              coincidentally, a huge loss of influence for the U.S. government, which 
              has traditionally used the IMF’s <a href="http://www.cepr.net/index.php/publications/reports/ten-years-after-the-lasting-impact-of-the-asian-financial-crisis/">creditors’ cartel</a> for its own imperial purposes.</p>
              <p>The BRICS’ new CRA has the potential to break the pattern not only of
               U.S.-EU global dominance but also of the harmful conditions typically 
              attached to balance of payments support. It could prove very important 
              in the next few years: A lot of money has poured into emerging market 
              government bonds since the Fed set short-term interest rates at zero 
              more than five years ago. A lot of it could up and leave when the Fed 
              decides to raise interest rates here. Such rate hikes were a major cause
               of the Mexican peso crisis in 1995 and hit other countries such as 
              Brazil and Argentina a few years later. The BRICS countries have 
              indicated that they are open to having other countries join. China has 
              about <a href="http://www.ft.com/intl/cms/s/0/4768bd3c-c461-11e3-8dd4-00144feabdc0.html#axzz37lCU97l8">$4 trillion in reserves</a>,
               so it has the potential to contribute vastly more and probably still 
              come out ahead, as most of its reserves will likely be losing money in 
              U.S. Treasury bonds. There’s no telling how soon this new fund will be 
              up and running or how big or inclusive it will grow to be. But the 
              upside potential for the world economy is very big.</p>

              <h1 class="title">BRICS Posing Serious Eastern Challenge To Western Hegemony</h1>
              <p><strong>By Dr. Sawraj Singh</strong></p>
              <p>The 6th BRICS Summit in Fortaleza, Brazil just concluded. Dilma 
              Rousseff, President of Brazil; Vladimir Putin, President of Russia; 
              Narendra Modi, Prime Minister of India; Xi Jinping, President of China; 
              Jacob Zuma, President of South Africa; attended. Cristina Fernandez de 
              Kirchner, President of Argentina was the invited leader. The main agenda
               was to set up a BRICS development bank. The group signed a document to 
              create a $100 billion BRICS development bank and a revenue currency pool
               worth over $100 billion.  The bank will be located in Shanghai and an 
              Indian will be the first President of the bank.</p>
              <p>The BRICS countries together form about 46% of the world’s population
               and about 20% of the world’s economy. Their share of the world economy 
              is rapidly increasing. The investment banking firm Goldman Sachs Group 
              has projected that by 2030, the Chinese economy is going to supersede 
              the American economy, and by 2050, the Chinese economy will be double 
              the size of the American economy.</p>
              <p>The same projection shows that after 
              2050, India’s economy will also supersede the American economy. It is 
              obvious that the BRICS countries will play an ever-increasing role in 
              the world economy and world affairs. Many other countries have shown 
              interest to join BRICS. Argentina is almost sure to join. South Korea, 
              Mexico, Turkey, and Indonesia have shown strong interest in joining the 
              organization. Not only the area and population base of the organization 
              will represent more than 50% of the world, but eventually, the 
              organization will also represent more than 50% of the world’s economy.</p>
              <p>After World War II, the present global economic institutions, the 
              International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the World Bank, came into 
              existence. They openly promoted western monopoly and hegemony. It is not
               an exaggeration to say that these institutions were based upon 
              inequality and injustice. Their constitutions did not let them give a 
              fair representation. The western countries were given more voting rights
               and control.</p>
              <p>As the share of the West in world economy and world trade 
              continued to decline, and that of the East continued to rise, there were
               repeated attempts by eastern countries to change these institutions so 
              that they reflected more the changing equations and shifts in world 
              power. However, the western powers refused to bring any meaningful 
              changes. This led the eastern countries to develop parallel 
              institutions. BRICS is one of such institutions which are challenging 
              western hegemony.</p>
              <p>The summit brought the three major eastern countries, Russia, China, 
              and India, together. Prime Minister Modi of India had a very lengthy 
              meeting with President Xi Jinping of China. It was scheduled for 40 
              minutes, but the meeting lasted 80 minutes. The two countries want to 
              promote mutual understanding and cooperation, particularly in the 
              economic field.</p>
              <p>The Chinese President will visit India and the Indian 
              Prime Minister is expected to visit China later this year. China will 
              help to develop infrastructure in India. China will also try to narrow 
              the trade gap between the two countries. China and India will try to 
              develop their economies in a mutually complementary fashion.</p>
              <p>India and Russia also got a chance to revive their traditional and 
              time-tested friendship. Prime Minister Modi told Putin that the Indian 
              people have always considered Russia as their most trusted friend who 
              has always stood by them. Putin also thanked India for taking stands 
              different than the western countries, and that these Indian stands have 
              helped Russia to fight western efforts to isolate Russia.</p>
              <p>It became clear in the Summit that Russia, China, and India have a 
              lot more in common than differences among them. All three countries have
               realized that they are not going to get an equal, fair, or respectable 
              status in the present western-dominated world order. Therefore, they 
              have to work together to change the present unipolar world order to a 
              multipolar world.</p>
              <p>The western domination of the last two centuries and American 
              hegemony of the last half century are not going to last much longer. The
               6th BRICS Summit and the interest shown by other countries, 
              particularly the Latin American countries, to join and work with BRICS 
              shows that there is very broad support in opposing western domination 
              and hegemony. The BRICS Bank will challenge the World Bank and IMF, 
              eventually forcing these institutions to either fundamentally change 
              their attitude or become irrelevant and marginalized.</p>
              <p>The rise of BRICS represents the rise of the East. The rise of the 
              East does not mean that western domination and hegemony will be replaced
               by Eastern domination and hegemony.</p>
              <p>The overwhelming response BRICS is 
              getting in Latin America shows that as opposed to the western 
              narrow-minded approach, the eastern approach is universal. Eastern 
              philosophy has always been universal. Sri Guru Granth Sahib, which I 
              believe represents the highest evolution of Eastern philosophy and the 
              zenith of Eastern spirituality, is truly universal and has a true global
               perspective. The world needs such philosophy which is truly universal 
              and can impart a true global perspective, which the present 
              globalization lacks.</p>
              <p>BRICS Bank will create competition for the World Bank, IMF, and other
               similar regional funds. BRCIS nations have criticized the World Bank 
              and the IMF for not giving developing nations enough voting rights.</p>
              <p>One 
              of the goals of the Bank is to increase the amount of money loaned to 
              developing countries to help with infrastructure and those programs 
              which help majority of people by improving the quality of their lives. 
              Healthcare and education are some such fields.</p>
              <p>As John Perkins pointed 
              in his book Confessions of an Economic Hit Man, the U.S. and the World 
              Bank forced the developing countries to abandon such programs and 
              instead adopt those programs which would increase gap between the rich 
              and the poor. Concentration of wealth created a comprador wealthy class 
              which could be easily controlled by the U.S. The BRICS Bank will 
              hopefully try to reverse such practices.</p>
