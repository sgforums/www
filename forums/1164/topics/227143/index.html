Apache can carry 1200 ammo rounds , and Cobras can carry only 700 ammos.<br><br>As for the question why it was the US Army who breached the Normandy during WW2. That's because US Army has the bases in Europe..When US joined WW2 on the side of Allies, US Army sent soldiers to friendly European countries , and stationed themselves there until D-day comes( invasion of Normandy).<br><br>To invade the country with coastlines which is far away from US allies  , US Marines send USS Tarawa, ( amphidious Assault ship which look like mini carrier , with landing crafts , tanks, Harriers, Cobras, Chinooks, APCs, Light Artillery and a battalion of Marines ) .<br><br>From US aircraft carrier, US Navy send Prowlers, and Hornets to disable air defence and coastal defence.<br><br>From the USS Tarawa, US Marines sent soldiers and equipments to enemy coastlines ,using the landing crafts and transport helos, with Cobras and Harriers providing air supports.<br><br>When they reach enemy coastlines, they clear enemy resistance and set up bases and run ways ( for bigger aircrafts) and then main reinforcement of US Army comes and station themselves there..</div>
