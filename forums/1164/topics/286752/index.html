J. Habibie, Minister of Technology and Research of Indonesia from 1978 to 1998, wanted Indonesia to leapfrog from a Third World country to a First World, industrialized country. Being an aerospace engineer, he naturally wanted Indonesia to have its own domestic aircraft manufacturing program.<br><br>With the blessings of his boss (Suharto), Indonesia spent at least $ 2 billion to develop the N-250. Critics, both domestic and international, derided the plane as a (flying) white elephant. The World Bank was not too pleased with this project.<br><br>The N-250 was a commercial turboprop that did fly in 1995. The Indons then tried to market this plane to the world. The problem was nobody bought the plane!<br><br>Why would anyone buy this unknown turboprop from a poor, third-world country when you can buy a similar plane from the US, Canada, Brazil, Sweden, etc. with a good track record?<br><br>The only overseas interest came from Malaysia where a proposal was made to swap Malaysian-made Proton cars for Indonesian N-250's. This deal never made it past the paper stage.<br><br>Then the 1997 Asian Financial crisis hit. The Indonesian rupiah, which was about 2600 to the US$1 and devalued till it reached about 22,000 rupiah to the US dollar.<br><br>The Indonesian economy also went on a nose-dive, there were riots on the streets of Jakarta, foreign investors fled and Suharto, who had been in power for more than 30 years, had to relinquish his throne in 1998.<br><br>BJ Habibie, who was then the Vice President, succeeded Suharto briefly for about a year. The N-250, along with Habibie's dreams of "leap-frogging" Indonesia to industrialization, died after Habibie left office.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Probably something to read and laugh over.<br><br>Cause ST's stuff are not made like theirs for "national pride", but they are usually requested by the army...a problem that needs to be solved.<br><br>ST and DSTA are primarily problem solvers...and making "new weapons" is a secondary result of it.<br><br>That ensures that it doesn't produce things that are useless or unsellable...cause in the first place they were created to solve problems that the army identified.</div>
