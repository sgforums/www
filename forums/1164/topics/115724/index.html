            <div class='col-md body'>But even if they do have enough Air-lift capability,and ships,their ships are mostly vintage warships,and since as an island,RSAF should have enough time to react by downing the aircrafts both combat and transport,the transport aircraft would most probably be ferrying their Special Forces and air-dropping them unless they are capable of doing what the Israelis did in Operation Jonathan and land at one our air-bases or airport,which is highly unlikely as they will be intercepted.After dealing with the aircrafts,RSAF can simply give a hand to the RSN and take out whatever ships they have sent our way.Indonesia is not a big problem really,as we would have ample time to organise a defence and and offensive operation.<br><br>But the bigger problem would be from Malaysia.From Johor,the distance is only across a causeway,even if it was blown up,their LSTs,or what can be over here in like 20mins.Thus,although it is important that we build up our defenses on one area,we must not forget that we are just an island with many "big brothers"around us,some more offensive,the others less offensive.<br><br>Just my 2cents <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"></div>
