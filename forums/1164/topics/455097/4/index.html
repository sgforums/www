              Two senior JI members detained under ISA
              Posted: 11 October 2012 1810 hrs
              
              SINGAPORE: Two senior members of the Jemaah Islamiyah (JI) terrorist organisation have been detained under the Internal Security Act (ISA) for involvement in terrorism-related activities.
              
              The Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA) said on Thursday that it issued Orders of Detention (ODs) against Abd Rahim Abdul Rahman in March this year and Husaini Ismail in June this year.
              
              MHA said the two had undergone terrorist training in Afghanistan with the Al-Qaeda terrorist organisation in 1999/2000.
              
              They had also been actively involved in observing several potential local and foreign targets in Singapore for a terrorist attack.
              
              Both men fled Singapore in December 2001 soon after the start of the security operation against the JI and took refuge overseas.
              
              While on the run, Husaini was involved in a plot â€“ led by Singapore JI leader Mas Selamat Kastari â€“ to hijack an airplane bound for Singapore and crash it into Changi Airport in January 2002 to retaliate against the disruption of the Singapore JI network.
              
              Abd Rahim was arrested in Malaysia in February this year and was deported to Singapore.
              
              Husaini was arrested in Indonesia in June 2009 and was jailed for immigration offences.
              
              He was deported to Singapore after he had served his jail term, in May 2012.
              
              The ministry also announced that three individuals were released from detention between March and September 2012.
              
              JI member Rijal Yadri Jumari, who was detained under the ISA in March 2008, was released on 20 March this year.
              
              He was a member of the JIâ€™s â€œAl-Ghurabaâ€� cell in Pakistan that comprised young JI members who were being groomed to be operatives and future JI leaders.
              
              Mohd Jauhari Abdullah, a senior JI member detained in September 2002 in the second phase of the Singapore JI arrests, was released on 15 September this year.
              
              Muhammad Fadil Abdul Hamid, a self-radicalised youth who intended to wage armed jihad in Afghanistan and die as a martyr on the battlefield, was detained under the ISA in April 2010 and released on 4 April 2012.
              
              The Restriction Orders (ROs) against 18 persons were allowed to lapse between March and September this year, as they had been cooperative and responsive to rehabilitation efforts and no longer required further supervision under the RO regime.
              
              The 18 include a Moro Islamic Liberation Front (MILF) member and 17 JI members.

              SELF- RADICALISED 20-YEAR-OLD NSMAN DETAINED UNDER ISA     
              By Mustafa Shafawi &amp; Imelda Saad | Posted: 06 July 2010 1614 hrs 
                  
                  
              SINGAPORE : Authorities have arrested a self-radicalised Singaporean under the Internal Security Act (ISA) and put two others under Restriction Orders.
                  
              20-year-old Muhammad Fadil Abdul Hamid was detained on April 4. He is a full-time national serviceman in the Singapore Armed Forces (SAF) who drew most of his ideas from the Internet.
                  
              He is the sixth self-radicalised Singaporean to be detained.
                  
              Singapore's Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA) said Muhd Fadil avidly surfed the Internet in search of jihadist propaganda and videos when he was studying in a local polytechnic.
                  
              Over time, the ministry said, he became deeply radicalised by the lectures of radical ideologues such as Sheikh Feiz Muhammad and Anwar al-Awlaki.
                  
              Muhd Fadil then became convinced that it was his religious duty to undertake armed jihad alongside fellow militants.
                  
              To undertake militant jihad overseas, Muhd Fadil went online to search for information on bomb-making.
                  
              He also produced and posted a video glorifying martyrdom and justifying suicide bombing.
                  
              The MHA said that Fadil did not have any plans to undertake jihad-related activities in Singapore but to pursue them in places like Palestine, Afghanistan and Iraq.
                  
              Responding to media queries, Singapore's Defence Ministry said Muhd Fadil was an NSF trainee undergoing section leader training in Pasir Laba Camp at the point of his arrest.
                  
              It added investigations have shown that this case involves an individual who took the wrong path.
                  
              The ministry said at the national level, there are appropriate security processes and systems to monitor and guard against potential security threats.
                  
              Separately, two others have been placed on two-year Restriction Orders.
                  
              They are 44-year-old Muhammad Anwar Jailani and 27-year-old Muhammad Thahir Shaik Dawood. 
                  
              The MHA said Muhd Anwar is an unaccredited religious teacher who had distributed CDs containing Anwar al-Awlaki's lectures, calling on Muslims to undertake militant jihad.
                  
              Muhd Thahir, who runs a small business, was one of Muhd Anwar's students.
                  
              He travelled to Yemen to seek out Anwar al-Awlaki and other radicals with a view to participating in armed jihad.
                  
              While in Yemen, he however had doubts and was persuaded to drop his jihad cause.

              TERROR SUSPECTS 'NORMAL NEIGHBORS', RESIDENTS SAY
              
              The Jakarta Post, Jakarta | Jakarta | Sat, October 27 2012, 11:29 PM 
              
              
              The three terror suspects arrested by officers from the National Police's Densus 88 counterterrorism unit on Saturday in Palmerah, West Jakarta, were good neighbors, according to a local resident.
              
              The police arrested Davit Ashary, 19; Herman Styono, 22; and Yanto,whose age was not immediately available, on Jl. Palmerah Barat II at around 11 a.m. on Saturday, drawing the attention of local residents, among them Udiyanto, the neighborhood chief.
              
              â€œDavit and Herman got along pretty well with their neighbors and never did anything suspicious or made any scenes,â€� Udiyanto told The Jakarta Poston Saturday.
              
              According to Udiyanto, the suspects lived with their mother, a factory worker.
              
              â€œThey have been living in the neighborhood for a very long time, while [Yanto] is a newcomer,â€� he said.
              
              A Densus 88 unit also arrested on Saturday a fourth man, identified as Sunarto Sofyan, 39, in Tanah Abang, West Jakarta.
              
              Sunarto nephew Arif Fahriansyah, 34 said that his uncle was arrested
              
              without a warrant around 12 noon when he was distributing meat from Idul Adha sacrifices to local residents.
              
              â€œOur family was organizing the distribution in the neighborhood, when the police came and suddenly took my uncle and raided the house without warrants,â€� Arif said, adding that the police only confiscated a laptop from the house.
              
              â€œThere were no detonators found in the house,â€� he said.
              
              Arif said that his uncle worked at a cargo company in Tanah Abang and lived with his parents.
              
              A local resident, Satya, 57, said that Sunarto's family was a respected family that has lived in the neighborhood. He also regularly delivered sermons during Friday prayers, Satya said. â€œWe all saw him as a good man.â€�
              
              The police said that the suspected terrorists were members of a new group, Harakah Sunniyyah untuk Masyarakat Islami (HASMI). (swd)

              MALAYSIA CLOSELY MONITORING ARREST OF DUO IN LEBANON 
              
              
              PUTRAJAYA: Malaysia is closely monitoring the arrest of two Malaysians in Lebanon, on suspicion of having links with the al-Qaeda terrorist organisation.
               
              Foreign Minister Datuk Seri Anifah Aman said the two Malaysians aged 28 and 21, were arrested in Beirut by the Lebanese authorities on Oct 18.
               
              â€œAt this juncture, the case is still being investigated by the Lebanese authorities and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs is closely monitoring the case.
               
              "Malaysia does not condone terrorism or extremism by any group that may compromise the security of any country and its people, and fully respects the laws of Lebanon," he said in a statement here today.
               
              Anifah said the two suspects had been brought to the Military Court in Beirut on Thursday where the charges were read to them and both were scheduled to appear in court again on Monday.
               
              "The Malaysian Embassy in Beirut, Lebanon is taking action to meet the two Malaysian nationals and provide consular advice," he said.
               
              He added that the families of the two suspects have also been informed of their arrest. -- BERNAMA

              CALL TO EXTEND AFGHAN MISSION
              
              KUALA LUMPUR: Malaysia is keen to continue with peacekeeping duties in Afghanistan, even after its mandate there ends in August next year.
              
              Armed Forces chief Gen Tan Sri Zulkifeli Mohd Zin said the matter would be decided after negotiations between the two governments.
               
              "We have recommended to the defence minister (Datuk Seri Dr Ahmad Zahid Hamidi) to our deployment in Afghanistan. We are prepared for such missions," Zulkifeli said after briefing members of the Malaysian Contingent (Malcon) 5 at the Sultan Mizan Armed Forces Hospital, yesterday.
               
              The multinational forces under the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation is scheduled to pull out by 2014.
               
              Malcon 5, comprising 40 officers and men, will depart for a six-month stint under the International Security Assistance Force in two batches.
               
              The first batch of five, led by Lt Col Zulkinine Yunus, leaves today on a Royal Australian Air Force C-17 Globemaster III to Kandahar, with the remaining 35 on Oct 24 on board an Emirates Air flight to Bagram.
               
              Malcon is primarily responsible for healthcare and community work in Bamyam along with the Provincial Reconstruction Team from New Zealand. They have helped provide solar panels to generate electricity, water purifiers and in disease control efforts.

              AUSTRALIAN GOVERNMENT DEPARTMENT OF DEFENCE
              
              Battle casualties in Afghanistan
              
              Definition of â€˜battle casualtiesâ€™
              
              The Australian Defence Force (ADF) defines â€˜battle casualtiesâ€™ as personnel who are killed, wounded, missing or captured as a consequence of action against the enemy.
              
              Definition of â€˜woundedâ€™
              
              Any ADF member who is serving in war-like conditions and is hurt during contact with the enemy is said to have been â€˜woundedâ€™. 
              
              Definition of â€˜injuredâ€™
              
              An ADF member hurt in an incident that has not been the result of enemy action in warlike conditions is said to have been â€˜injuredâ€™.
              
              Treatment and management of battle casualties
              
              Australian force protection measures are designed to minimise our casualties in a combat area. However, when they occur, Defence takes very good care of its people. ADF members who are wounded on operations and suffer minor physical impairment are treated and, once fit, return to service. 
              
              Where the impairment is serious, members are transferred as rapidly as possible and provided with appropriate treatment at the nearest hospital. On occasions, additional treatment at a specialist facility in Germany may be required. 
              
              For the more seriously wounded, once stabilised, the member is returned to Australia for additional treatment and rehabilitation. Within five to ten days of returning to Australia, the member is placed in the ADF rehabilitation program to manage all their health and rehabilitation requirements. 
              
              The ADF rehabilitation program aims to:
              â€¢Reduce the impact of injury or illness through early clinical intervention;
              â€¢Reduce any psychological effects of the injury;
              â€¢Return the member to suitable work at the earliest possible time; and,
              â€¢Provide a professionally managed rehabilitation plan tailored to individual needs.
              
              For more information on rehabilitation, see:
              â€¢Department of Defence: www.defence.gov.au/health/DRC/i-drc.htm
              â€¢Department of Veteransâ€™ Affairs: www.dva.gov.au/rehabilitation/Pages/index.aspx
              
              ADF members who are killed in action are repatriated to Australia for burial in accordance with next of kin wishes.
              
              ADF personnel deployed to Afghanistan wounded in action
              
              Since Operation SLIPPER commenced, 242 ADF members have been wounded in action in Afghanistan. The breakdown for wounded by year from 2002 onwards is:
              
              Year                Number
              
              2002-04              4
              
              2005                    2

              2008                   26
              
              2009                   37
              
              2010                   65 (64 soldiers and 1 sailor)
              
              2011                   50
              
              2012                   29 (28 soldiers and 1 sailor)
              
              Total                   242 (240 soldiers and 2 sailors) as at 16 October 2012
              
              
              The types of injuries sustained can be broadly categorised as:
              
              â€¢Amputations,
              â€¢Fractures,
              â€¢Gun shot wounds,
              â€¢Hearing loss,
              â€¢Lacerations/contusions,
              â€¢Concussion/traumatic brain injury,
              â€¢Penetrating fragments, and
              â€¢Multiple severe injuries.
              
              Defence continually reviews and consolidates available information and processes to ensure that all ADF personnel wounded on operations are accurately recorded. As a result these figures could be subject to adjustment in the future.
              
              2012 Wounded in Action incidents in Afghanistan
              
              Twenty nine Australian Defence Force personnel have suffered wounds as a result of battle: eighteen were involved in improvised explosive device attacks, eight were wounded during contact with the enemy, two soldiers were wounded in small arms fire incidents and one was wounded during the conduct of operations.
              
              For the types of injuries sustained six personnel have sustained gun shot wounds, one suffered amputations, four suffered fractures, six suffered fragmentation wounds, one sustained lacerations/contusions, and five suffered other injuries. Six personnel have suffered mild traumatic brain injury.

              Public information during incidents
              
              â€¢It is not appropriate for Defence to provide more specific details on injuries due to medical-in-confidence and privacy reasons. The Minister for Defence will provide broad categories of injuries sustained by our troops in his regular Ministerial Statements to Parliament.
              â€¢Defence aims to provide public information on every operational incident involving battle casualties (wounded and killed in action). Operational tempo, ongoing operations and special operations are three factors which may lead to occasional inconsistency in reporting. However, media information about casualty figures is updated as appropriate when operational circumstances permit. 
              
              Defence guidance on the release of public information during incidents includes:
              
              â€¢The ADF will not release the names of casualties until Next of Kin (NOK) procedures have been completed.
              â€¢The ADF will not comment on the circumstances or causes of an incident until any investigation has been completed and if it is likely to be subjected to disciplinary proceedings.
              â€¢In order to align with the civilian practice for reporting patient medical condition without compromising the medical-in-confidence nature of the wounds and injuries, Defence has adopted a nomenclature for public information relating to battle casualties: â—¦Life Threatening
               Injury and wounds that will likely lead to death if not immediately treated (e.g. fragmentation and gunshot wounds involving vital organs, head). Also applicable to an illness requiring admission to an intensive care facility. 
              â—¦Serious
               Injury and wounds requiring immediate medical care and hospitalisation but not considered life threatening (e.g. fragmentation and gunshot wounds to torso). Also applicable to an illness requiring hospitalisation. 
              â—¦Slight/Minor
               Injury and wounds requiring medical care and hospitalisation (e.g. fragmentation and gunshot wounds to the extremities). Also applicable to an illness requiring basic medical care/monitoring and restriction of duties. 
              â—¦Superficial
               Injury and wounds not requiring hospitalisation. 
              
              
              Public release of names
              
              â€¢Names of ADF members (not afforded protected identity status) remaining in an operational area following an announced wounding or injury will not be released.
              â€¢Names of ADF members (not afforded protected identity status) returning to Australia for treatment will remain protected until authorised for release by the individual member concerned. Names of ADF deceased will be released in consultation with the memberâ€™s family.
              â€¢Only Special Forces soldiers, who have protected identity status, may have their names withheld when they are admitted into non-military hospitals. 
              â€¢There is no policy to hide the identity of other Australian soldiers undergoing medical treatment and rehabilitation in private or public hospitals. 
              
              Frequently Asked Questions
              
              What are the timings for Aero Medical Evacuation (AME)?
              
              â€¢The ADF will always seek to evacuate wounded members to medical facilities as rapidly as possible. Our people are our priority.
              â€¢The ADF is satisfied that the AME support arrangements provided for our personnel in Afghanistan are appropriate.
              
              What are the mandated timings for treatment?
              
              â€¢Treatment is based on the severity of wounds or injuries and can be complicated by the tactical situation, particularly if troops are still engaged with the enemy.
              â€¢For life-threatening wounds or injuries the following timings are mandated by International Security Assistance Force and endorsed by Australia: â—¦All ADF personnel receive advanced first aid training and can provide immediate care within the first ten minutes of wounding.
              â—¦Evacuation assets aim to reach seriously wounded soldiers within one hour of wounding, and provide en-route care based on the clinical needs of the patient. This one hour guidance is not always possible when the tactical situation delays evacuation. 
              â—¦All attempts are made to evacuate casualties to a medical facility able to provide surgery within two hours of wounding. 
              â—¦For non life-threatening wounds the timings are extended although in many cases the evacuation process is such that the same timings result.
              
              
              What is a NOTICAS?
              
              Notification of casualty (NOTICAS) is the name for the formal reporting of casualties within the ADF. This reporting informs the chain of command and provides information that is passed to families of deployed personnel. NOTICAS reports are raised for every wounding and the reporting is undertaken as quickly as possible. Where possible, contact with the next of kin takes precedence over all other considerations.
              
              How does the ADF treat a casualty?
              
              â€¢The casualty treatment process is layered to provide the best possible care for ADF members.
              â€¢Initially, casualties are provided first aid or administer self-aid with combat medical supplies carried within the tactical force.
              â€¢All ADF members are trained in basic first aid.
              â€¢During initial first aid, an assessment is made as to the severity of the wounds. If required soldiers will call for additional medical support or an evacuation of the wounded or injured person.
              â€¢Tactical units may also include combat first aid trained personnel who have received advanced training in the initial treatment of wounds likely to be encountered on a battlefield.
              â€¢Special Forces patrols often include a patrol first aider or advanced combat first aider. These soldiers are trained in advanced first aid procedures and are similar to paramedics in the civilian world.
              â€¢If required wounded or injured personnel will be evacuated to a medical facility for further treatment.
              â€¢Australians serving in Uruzgan rely on a team of highly skilled Coalition and Australian trauma and medical staff working in a well equipped facility in Tarin Kot.
              â€¢This evacuation is conducted by the most suitable means, usually a helicopter.
              â€¢The Tarin Kot facility performs initial trauma management similar to the emergency department of a civilian hospital. If required, the facility can perform surgery to treat wounded soldiers. 
              
              If required patients can then be evacuated back to more advanced facilities elsewhere in Afghanistan or in Germany once they are stable enough to travel.

              UK MILITARY DEATHS IN AFGHANISTAN
                  
              The UK's military role in Afghanistan since 2001 has brought with it a heavy human toll. Members of the Army, RAF, Royal Marines and special forces have lost their lives in the fight against the Taliban. Here, the BBC News website offers a look at who they were and how they died.
