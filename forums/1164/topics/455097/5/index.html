              TWO MALAYSIAN SUICIDE BOMBERS HELD IN LEBANON
              
              JIHADIST MISSION: Duo suspected to have links with al-Qaeda terrorist organisation
               
              LEBANON authorities have arrested two Malaysians, believed to be suicide bombers and suspected to be linked to the al-Qaeda terrorist organisation.
               
              The suspects, aged 21 and 28, were nabbed at the Beirut International Airport.
               
              Malaysian Ambassador to Lebanon Ilango Karuppannan, said the duo were picked up several days ago but could not confirm the arrest date.
               
              He said the embassy knew about the arrests on Friday.
               
              "They (the suspects) were detained for suspected links to al-Qaeda.
               
              "They will be brought to court tomorrow, and we will enquire from them whether they require counsel," he said.
               
              Karuppannan said his office had informed Wisma Putra on the case so that the Foreign Ministry could inform the families of the detained.
               
              According to Lebanon's Al-Joumhouria newspaper on Thursday, quoting security sources, the Malaysians were detained by Lebanon's army intelligence on charges of being members of the terrorist organisation.
               
              Investigations revealed they were recruited into al-Qaeda by another Malaysian before being taken to Yemen where they met other members of the terror organisation.
               
              Al-Joumhouria said, about two months ago, the two Malaysian suspects had tried to enter Syria, via Turkey, on a jihadist mission to carry out suicide attacks.
               
              Their planned attacks were coordinated by a man, said to be responsible for the entry of all jihadists into Syria, said the daily.
               
              When the two Malaysians failed to enter Syria, they decided to head to Lebanon to carry out terrorist attacks but their activities caught the eye of army intelligence.
               
              The Malaysians were soon arrested and investigations revealed they were planning on contacting an individual in Lebanon to coordinate attacks.
               
              Meanwhile, Lee Shi-Ian reports from Kuala Lumpur that the duo were arrested on Oct 20 in Beirut.
               
              "They had gone to Turkey from Kuala Lumpur.
               
              "But because Turkish authorities knew who they were, they were denied entry into the country," a police source said.
               
              They then went on to Germany where they boarded a flight to Lebanon.
               
              The source said Lebanese authorities were already warned about the suspects.
               
              It is learnt that one of the suspects was previously arrested in Yemen for similar reasons and deported back to Malaysia. Bernama

              2 MALAYSIANS IN LEBANON DENY AL-QAEDA LINK 
              
              KUALA LUMPUR: The two Malaysians charged by a military court in Le-banon this week refuted the charges against them yesterday.
               
              The duo's defence counsel, Marwan Sinno, told the New Straits Times that the hearing, which began at 10.30am Lebanese time (5.30pm in Malaysia), proceeded smoothly.
               
              "With the help of interpreter, both of them told the judge that they were in Lebanon as tourists and had no links to al-Qaeda," Marwan said.
               
              He said the proceedings lasted for 21/2 hours and the two answered questions posed to them by the judge.
               
              A Malaysian embassy official was present during the questioning.
               
              Razif Mohd Ariff, 30, was questioned for about two hours. Muhammad Razin Sharhan Mustafa Kamal, 21, was then questioned for 30 minutes.
               
              Marwan said: "They should be released as there is no case against them. They committed no crime in Lebanon."
               
              He said if everything went well, the preliminary decision would be out by noon today.
               
              In the event there is no case against the duo, they could be released unconditionally. However, if there is substantial evidence gathered based on reports against them, a trial could take place and it would probably last up to a month or more.
               
              Razin and Razif were charged by a military tribunal for their alleged links to al-Qaeda and terrorist activities after being arrested in Lebanon on Oct 20.

              MALAYSIA NOT USED AS TERRORIST RECRUITMENT CENTRE, ASSURES HISHAM 
                      
              By MARTIN CARVALHO
                      
                      
              KUALA LUMPUR: International terror groups do not use Malaysia as a recruitment ground although they view it as a transit point, Home Minister Datuk Seri Hishammudin Hussein said.
                       
              "I want to assure Malaysians that the country is not a target at the present moment," he told reporters after chairing a meeting on crime prevention at Parliament House.
                       
              Although he acknowledged that Malaysia may be a transit point for terrorists, Hishammuddin dismissed fears that Malaysia was being used as a recruitment ground by the groups.
                       
              "I can confirm that this is not the case," he said, adding that the two Malaysians detained in Beirut for alleged links to Al-Qaeda were not part of a terrorist cell here.
                       
              He said the authorities were aware of the activities and movements of locals and foreigners suspected of having links to terrorists groups.
                       
              He added that there were sufficient laws to address the threat and Malaysia has been working closely with intelligence agencies of the United States, Britain, China, Pakistan and India to combat international terrorism.
                       
              Malaysians Muhamad Razin Sharhan Mustafa Kamal, 21, and Razif Mohd Ariff, 30, were detained by Lebanese army intelligence at a hotel in Beirut several days ago.

              Mahmood, it's rude to do wall of text spamming. If you want to go to Afganistan, go ahead, no point fishing for complements here. If you want, do. If you need a total stranger's approval to decide to go, then you really are not committed in the first place.
              
              If you want to go, go. Don't stay on forums saying how much you plan on going.

              Actually, I'm RSTA.

              As I already mentioned, you're just wall of text and hyperlink spamming, not good public behaviour.
              
              Or should I even be more blunt.
              
              You're just here to stroke your own balls and to find other people that agree with you so you can congratulate yourself for being so "right thinking". You don't really care what people disagree with you are saying, you simply edit them out so you can "hear only what you want to hear". Narcisistic twit.
              
              Go back and re-read all the replies to you. None of the regulars are free to talk without toeing the party line, and honestly, the rest don't care. If you do care so much, sign on and join up, otherwise, you're just as we old timers say "NATO". No idea what that acryonym stands for? Ask around.

              IN CASE WE FORGET THE TERRORIST THREAT IN SINGAPORE
              
              Jemaah Islamiyah
              Objective
              The ultimate goal of JI is to create a region-wide Daulah Islamiyah or "Islamic State" made up of Malaysia, Indonesia, southern Philippines, Brunei and Singapore.
              
              Origins
              JI was formed in Malaysia by exiled members of a radical Islamic organisation in Indonesia known as Darul Islam or DI, meaning "House of Islam". Several members of DI had fled from Indonesia to Malaysia in the 1980s to avoid arrest by the government. They regrouped under the leadership of JI founders Abdullah Sungkar and Abu Bakar Bashir. Sungkar and Bashir expanded their network of followers through recruitment in Singapore and Malaysia, and in 1993 they formally founded JI. After the fall of Indonesian president Suharto in 1998, some key JI figures returned to Indonesia.
              
              International Links
              JI has links to Al-Qaeda, considered the world's most dangerous international terrorist group. Selected JI members have been sent for military training at Al-Qaeda camps in Afghanistan since the 1990s, and it was an Al-Qaeda operative that initiated the embassy bomb plot in Singapore. In addition, JI has close ties with Kumpulan Militan Malaysia and Moro Islamic Liberation Front (MILF), militant groups based in Malaysia and the Philippines, respectively.
              
              Singapore Branch
              The first leader of JI's Singapore branch, Haji Ibrahim bin Haji Maidin, was recruited into Sungkar and Bashir's network in the late 1980s. Ibrahim Maidin was a religious teacher and used his religious classes as a recruitment ground. A 2002 estimate by ISD put the size of the Singapore branch at 60 to 80 members.
              
              The qoaid wakalah or "leader" heads the branch. Ibrahim Maidin was the qoaid wakalah until 1999, when Mas Selamat bin Kastari took over the position. ISD arrested Ibrahim Maidin in 2001 and Mas Selamat in 2006. Mas Selamat escaped in February 2008 but was captured in Malaysia on 1 April 2009.
              
              The branch is organised into five functional units known as fiah: operations, security, missionary work, fund-raising and communications. Within the operations fiah, there are several smaller cells, also called fiah. The plan to bomb diplomatic missions in Singapore involved the cell known as Fiah Musa.

              1981 - 1983, School Of Artillery (SOAY) - Kangaw Camp (Sembawang Air Base). Our PM Lee H L was an OCT with SOAY. During the Israelis invasion of Lebanon, we had Israelis military delegation visitation. We had a presentation and was ordered not to mentioned the word "Invasion" but instead used the word "Advance". One of our officer was attached to the Israelis company as an observer during their advancement into Lebanon.
                  
                  Just before my ROD...we shifted to Khatib Camp.
                  
                  Wish I had taken my MPO advised to sign on with SAF. I'm 49 years old wish I can volunteer for that SAF mission in Afghanistan.

              Yup, you're older, slightly. :)
              
              I may not "have to read" the posts (in fact it's too long, can't be bothered to read wallspam), but it is still bad manners to spam wall to wall posts. You familiar with the modern day acronyms TL;DR? It's a side effect of too much of this.
              
              If you want to see how it feels like and why it's bad manners, look up someone called "lionnoisy" and read through his posts. You'll soon feel what your readers feel.
