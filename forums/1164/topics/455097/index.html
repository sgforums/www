              <p>I support fighting terrorism and AQ in Afghanistan because AQ inspired JI and because I support the US.</p>
              <p>TS, I am not trying to target you. But since you addressed active personnel, I caution them in expressing even supportive opinions, because if their support or opposition is too strident, and the relevant power blunt or ill-informed, they may find themselves or their career trajectories docked.</p>

              <p>Yup, just shut up and do. USA is our ally but our top leaders often criticize it to avoid this appearance. It is a mature power that understands our need to do so. We made headlines in the US when we lectured them on China, right? Not a very complicated topic but as a regular, it is good to avoid being heard mentioning it until the distant day comes that you are not penalized for it.</p>
              <p>I'm not sure why you need to hear it here in order to know "how ready SAF men are". Does saying it make them more ready?</p>
              <p>As a regular, I would go to Afghan. Boosts my career and SAF mission is 99.9% safe. Big MRAP vehicle but you never ever leave the base. RSAF flies UAV, artillery mans the ARTHUR radar. I suppose among regulars, competition to go is stiff.</p>
              <p>For me personally, I would go for the experience, touch an AK, interact with ISAF troops. Get some nice beige boots too.</p>

              <p>Singaporean don't go around telling people who are our enemy and who are threats to our country, especially when Mindef is not sure, according to you, if their men are ready. SAF will continue to train and equip to stand ready as a useful contribution to the total defence of our nation. Unless we are aware of how MFA and Home Affairs are working to maintain our sovereignty, all talks with boiling blood about defending the country is but hot air. period</p>

              <p>haha...I have no commitment to China at all, but very very cautious. They are big, they are also unknown, not communist, not capitalist, big difference between the government and the people, and the netizen, big difference between the coastal cities and those in the west, this is despite the difference between the shanghaiese and those in Beijing, and the Hong Kong Chinese, the Taiwanese and the those who returned from overseas æµ·å½’äººå£«. They can have lots of difference among themselves, but can suddenly become very nationalistic. They are just too big and complicatedã€‚ I read their newspapers, I watch their news and TV, I visit China like 5 times every year. Very hard to do business, very hard to understand, definitely cannot trust, not before 5 meetings..</p>
              <p>We are too small to handle China alone on regional issues, I don't think bringing in the yangkee as big brother will help, because I don't trust the yangkee, I wish the countries in the region could be more cooperative, I hope Asean can work better as a regional power, I believe that the balance of power to China comes from Asean, Japan and Korea, India and Pakistan, and of course the Russian in the north...the US can contribute of course, but they won't be the big brother....</p>

              <p>Actually they are pro ROC, not PRC, that is the traditional mindset. They have access to Chinese interenational media, but we do too, but they are less influenced by the western media. Their disillusion with own country was less compared with their disillusioned with the communist China.</p>
