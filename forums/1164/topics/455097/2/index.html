              <p>I think they are actually more influenced by PRC international media because ROC's is far less common to them. Eg the PRC sends more than 10 satellite channels into South East Asia, and it is far better than local countries' including Malaysia's. It makes local media look like crap by comparison and is full of positive views of PRC. Eg. it has good quality news programs that mix positive news on PRC with objective news on the rest of the world.</p>
              <p>Among the conservative overseas Chinese, except for those who experienced all the shit in PRC before the 80s, most people lean towards the PRC and see the ROC as an American tool. This applies to most Malaysian Chinese and overseas Chinese because PRC let very few people migrate during that period. Current generation of PRC migrants are too young to have experienced it.</p>

              <p>Malaysian
               Chinese have more common cultural link with HK and ROC. They use 
              traditional Chinese writing ç¹�ä½“å­— till 2008 and today are still debating 
              what are the simplified characters they should adopt. Their common day 
              to day dialect is more Cantonese than Mandarin, in their local Chinese 
              radio and TV they speak cantonese. Their singers, such as 
              å…‰è‰¯ï¼Œå“�å† ï¼Œæ›¹æ ¼ï¼Œæˆ´ä½©å¦®ï¼Œæ¢�é�™å¦‚all went to Taiwan, none has gone to China. Malaysian 
              Chinese watch more of the Star TV and TVBS, in the south they watch æ—©å®‰ä½ å¥½
               on Channel 8. The only channel they watch that is very PRC is å‡¤å‡°é¢‘è§†. not
               many people watch China Central TV ä¸­å¤®å�°.</p>
              <p>The real problem with 
              their identification, or the lack of, with PRC is the way PRC treat 
              them. To the mainland Chinese, their own country men å¤§é™†å�Œèƒž comes 
              firstï¼Œthen it is the æµ·å½’å�Œèƒž the Chinese returned from overseas

               are just overseas Chinese å�Žä¾¨. Singaporean are treated as Singaporean 
              Chinese, with respect.</p>
              <p>The Malaysian Chinese still can't see much in PRC, except the business opportunity and a visit to their ancestors villages.</p>
              <p>Malaysian
               Chinese who left China before 1947 were from ROC, they know the 
              communists. They were not happy with the British colonial master, but 
              only a small group joined Cheng Ping in the jungle. The Malaysian 
              Chinese left China for a better living, not so much disillusion with the
               government because the country was at war with Japan. The disillusion 
              with China, PRC came in the peirod of cultural revolution.</p>

              <p>Malaysian Chinese nowadays learn simplified text in schoool. They can read but cannot write the traditional text. For some reason the newspapers still use traditional text, I asked them why and they don't know. Maybe for the older generation's sake.</p>
              <p>You mean PRC Chinese treat Malaysian Chinese and Singaporean Chinese differently?</p>
              <p>Whatever reason their grandparents left China, Malaysian Chinese have very little sense of belonging to their country. They will talk bad about the dominant race there but they won't talk bad about the whole country because they live there, but that's about it. Maybe they lean towards Taiwan, but the current generation onwards do not have any dislike for PRC. I don't think they will take sides in a PRC or ROC conflict unless they see one side as clearly wrong or provocative.</p>

                          <p>Yup, just shut up and do. USA is our ally but our top leaders
                          often criticize it to avoid this appearance. It is a mature power
                          that understands our need to do so. We made headlines in the US
                          when we lectured them on China, right? Not a very complicated topic
                          but as a regular, it is good to avoid being heard mentioning it
                          until the distant day comes that you are not penalized for it.</p>
                          <p>I'm not sure why you need to hear it here in order to know "how
                          ready SAF men are". Does saying it make them more ready?</p>
                          <p>As a regular, I would go to Afghan. Boosts my career and SAF
                          mission is 99.9% safe. Big MRAP vehicle but you never ever leave
                          the base. RSAF flies UAV, artillery mans the ARTHUR radar. I
                          suppose among regulars, competition to go is stiff.</p>
                          <p>For me personally, I would go for the experience, touch an AK,
                          interact with ISAF troops. Get some nice beige boots too.</p>

              <p>Thank you.</p>
              <p>You actually raised an interesting point. SAF is extremely sensitive to deaths because it impacts the public's acceptance of NS, regardless of the deceased being regular or not, volunteer or not. Not a lot of people know that they take parents permission as a veto when you sign on in some high risk vocations eg pilots (although in SAF, the pilot fatality rate is probably lower than any other vocation). Regardless of your age, they won't let you sign on if your parents say no.</p>
              <p>I think this is backwards and unfair. Furthermore, SAF contradicts itself when it takes risks in other areas that result in people dying.</p>

              <p>Ok fair enough. You have a family to take care and would be worried for them. Yes, education is very important and he would be a good son to his parents and Singapore.  I'm sure your son will really see Singapore as his real home.</p>

              <p>Malaysian Chinese nowadays learn simplified text in schoool.
              They can read but cannot write the traditional text. For some

              <p>Whatever reason their grandparents left China, Malaysian Chinese
              have very little sense of belonging to their country. They will
              talk bad about the dominant race there but they won't talk bad
              about the whole country because they live there, but that's about
              it. Maybe they lean towards Taiwan, but the current generation
              onwards do not have any dislike for PRC. I don't think they will
              take sides in a PRC or ROC conflict unless they see one side as
              clearly wrong or provocative.</p>

              <p>Not sure who are those you referred to as older generation. In Malaysia, those in the 40s (not very old) still read and write in traditional Chinese Character. Their newspapers use traditional text because they have not been able to decide how they would convert from traditional to simplified. Sometimes the heading is in traditional character but the text in simplified, sometimes it is the other way round because the news is copied from HK and Taiwan. In Singapore, the government took the lead to change in early 1970, in Malaysia the government approved the use in 1980, but it is up to each individual or organization or school to make the switch.</p>
              <p>Yes, mainland Chinese do not treat all Singaporean and Malaysian Chinese the same. With Singaporean there are many things to talk about and questions to ask, but with the malaysian chinese, there is really nothing much that will interest them.</p>
              <p>The Malaysian Chinese are interested in China because of the business opportunities and the many tourist attractions, young and old. in entertainment, the younger malaysian are more familiar with å�´å¿ å®ªï¼Œå‘¨æ�°ä¼¦...the older ones are more familiar with éƒ‘å°‘ç§‹ and æ�Žé¦™ç�´. you are right that they don't like but they don't talk bad about their country, and they are still looking for better and greaner pasture when they can, Singapore, Australia, UK, and even Taiwan...have not heard of any significant number of Malaysian Chinese in China, it is still not a place they are longing to go and live.</p>

              So far we have an SAF regular, Reservist and myself an ex-SAF personnel participating in this topic. Well, lets hope some full-time NS personnel will contribute their views and opinions.
              
              As for myself, I would go to Afghanistan not for personal gain or career or monetary reasons. I see the Afghan people are suffering from decades of continuous wars in their country. I see them as people who are in need of help to be protected from those Talibans, Al Qaeda members and terrorist insurgents aggression and oppression. The Afghan people have the rights for peace and freedom. The Talibans, Al Qaeda and Insurgents must be stopped from terrorising and killing more innocent hapless Afghans. They must be eradicate if possible from Afghanistan totally. Should they return to power and reign Afghanistan again, there will be no peace but more sufferrings for the Afghan people. I admit war is terrible and I know the victims of war are mainly the women and children. I do not support violence or war either but when I see those acts of violence and war are committed by those who are killing innocent people by attacking them to fulfil their own blind faith ambition and to force others to follow and adhere their blind faith ambition, and the only way to stop them is through violence and war, then with clear conscience I will not hesitate to stop them through violence or war either in order to achieve peace and freedom. 
              
              I fully support the presence of our SAF troops and the Allied or Coalition forces in Afghanistan. We are there for a good reason and it is never a mistake for other countries to intervene in protecting and safeguarding the Afghan people from further sufferrings and destructions in their own country. It is time for Afghanistan and the Afghan people to move forward, rebuild and develop their homeland. It is time for them to come out from the stoneage era and join with the rest of the world.

              Minister for Defence Visits SAF Troops in Afghanistan
              
              
              Minister for Defence Dr Ng Eng Hen visited Singapore Armed Forces (SAF) troops deployed in Afghanistan yesterday. He was accompanied by Chief of Army Major-General (MG) Ravinder Singh and other senior SAF officers.
              
              During his visit to Multinational Base Tarin Kowt (MBTK) located in Oruzgan province, Dr Ng met with members of the SAF medical team deployed at the field hospital there. The team provides emergency and trauma care, and primary healthcare to International Security Assistance Force (ISAF) personnel as well as to Afghan locals. Dr Ng was briefed on the SAF medical team's tasks and responsibilities by Team Commander Lieutenant-Colonel Foo Chek Boon. Sharing his thoughts on his experience in Afghanistan, Major (Dr) Soh Teck Hwee, an SAF doctor deployed with the medical team, said, "I am proud to be given the opportunity to be part of the SAF medical team in the field hospital in Oruzgan. We are operating in a challenging environment that is not without risk. But I believe that we are doing an important job, and the experience has been very meaningful, saving lives and attending to trauma cases which we do not get in our hospitals back home. Our skills have been put to good use, and the experience we have gained helpful to the SAF."
              
              While in MBTK, Dr Ng also met with members of the SAF's Imagery Analysis Team (IAT) deployed there. The 6-man IAT led by Lieutenant-Colonel Yeoh Keat Hoe augments ISAF's reconnaissance and surveillance capabilities in Oruzgan province. Speaking after meeting the troops, Dr Ng emphasised the importance of their role in contributing to the multinational efforts in Afghanistan. Dr Ng said, "I see in our men a high level of professionalism and commitment. The conditions here are tough, the risks high. I am proud of our men as through their gallant efforts, the SAF is playing its part in the global fight against terrorism, preventing terrorist organisations like Al Qaeda from using Afghanistan as a base to export terrorism to the rest of the world, including our region."
              
              Dr Ng also visited the SAF's team of ten Military Institutional Trainers (MIT) deployed at an artillery school at the Kabul Military Training Center (KMTC). The MIT team contributes to ISAF's efforts to train the Afghan National Army. The SAF has been deployed in Afghanistan since 2007 as part of Singapore's contributions to the multinational stabilisation and reconstruction efforts there

              Chief of Army Visits SAF Troops in Afghanistan
                  
                  
              Chief of Army Major-General (MG) Chan Chun Sing visited the Singapore Armed Forces' (SAF) troops in Afghanistan yesterday. At Kabul, MG Chan met the SAF institutional trainers deployed in an artillery school there, where he was updated by the team leader, Lieutenant-Colonel (LTC) Nicholas Seow, on the efforts to train the Afghan National Army. While in Kabul, he also met the Deputy Commander of the International Security Assistance Force Lieutenant General James Bucknall. At the same time, Republic of Singapore Air Force Chief of Staff Air Staff, Brigadier-General Hoo Cher Mou, visited the SAF's Unmanned Aerial Vehicle Task Group and the Weapon Locating Radar team deployed in Uruzgan province.
                  
                  
              MG Chan also visited the SAF Construction Engineering Team (CET) in Bamiyan province. In a ceremony held earlier, the SAF handed over the Foladi Comprehensive Health Clinic (FCHC) to the local Afghan authorities. The six-man SAF CET funded and supervised the construction of the clinic. The team had been deployed with the New Zealand Provincial Reconstruction Team since May 2010. FCHC is expected to serve 10,000 families in Foladi and the surrounding villages. 
                  
              With the successful completion of the FCHC by the 2010 CET deployment, the SAF has concluded its deployments to Bamiyan province. Compared to 2007, civilian aid groups and the local authorities in the province now have a greater capacity to carry out the type of work which the SAF's CETs have been doing. The conclusion of SAF's deployment to Bamiyan will allow the SAF to focus on other ongoing deployments in Afghanistan.
                  
              During his visit to Bamiyan, MG Chan expressed his appreciation to the SAF's partners in Bamiyan, in particular the New Zealand Defence Force, for the support they have provided for the SAF's deployment. He also thanked the local Afghans for their hospitality and assistance.
                  
              The SAF's first deployment to assist in the stabilisation and reconstruction of Afghanistan was a dental detachment to Bamiyan province in 2007. Over the past four years, the SAF has deployed four CETs to Bamiyan, making significant contributions to the province. The work of the SAF's CETs have focused mainly on improving healthcare in Bamiyan by funding and supervising the construction of a Paediatric and Women's Ward extension at the Bamiyan Provincial Hospital, a Regional Health Training Centre and the FCHC as well as setting up a dental clinic at the hospital.The SAF CETs also funded and supervised the construction of two bridges, a culvert and a water supply project to improve the infrastructure in Bamiyan. The teams also supervised the delivery of humanitarian assistance supplies to the local populace. 
                  
              The SAF currently has a 21-man Weapon Locating Radar team and a 52-man Unmanned Aerial Vehicle Task Group deployed in Uruzgan province. The SAF has also deployed a 4-man team of institutional trainers to the artillery school in Kabul.

              SAF personnel receive medals for efforts in Afghanistan
              
              
              Being a member of the Explosive Ordnance Disposal Unit in the Singapore Armed Forces (SAF) prepared MAJ Chester Lim Youjia well for his deployment in Afghanistan, where he trained Afghan National Army (ANA) commanders to detect and identify improvised explosive devices.
              
              MAJ Lim led a two-man team of Military Institutional Trainers (MITs) deployed in Oruzgan, Afghanistan, from October last year to February this year. He said the deployment had helped in his personal and professional development, adding: "The entire journey was memorable to me."
              
              In recognition of his contributions towards the SAF's overseas deployments in support of the multinational stabilisation and reconstruction efforts in Afghanistan, MAJ Lim, along with 42 other SAF personnel, was awarded the Overseas Service Medal. Minister for Defence Dr Ng Eng Hen presented the medals to the recipients at a ceremony held at Pasir Laba Camp on 7 Jun.
              
              In his speech, Dr Ng said: "As a small nation with limited resources, Singapore is very mindful to contribute within our means. But while our contributions may be small, compared to some of the larger militaries, they are in niche areas where we have the expertise and where we can make a significant operational difference to the overall coalition effort."
              
              Dr Ng added that the SAF deployments supported "the larger multinational effort to prevent extremists from using Afghanistan as a base to export terrorism to the rest of the world, including Singapore".
              
              He said: "The SAF has also benefited professionally from each successive deployment, our servicemen gaining useful operational experience that sharpens the entire SAF." He noted that the servicemen had performed well in their overseas deployments, and in doing so, had enhanced the SAF's reputation as "a professional outfit and a reliable partner".
              
              To prepare themselves for their tasks in Afghanistan, the SAF personnel had to undergo pre-deployment training which consisted of medical training, survival training and chemical defence.
              
              MAJ Lim highlighted one major difficulty he faced during his deployment: "There was a language barrier and we had difficulties trying to communicate with the Afghan soldiers. Even in the presence of translators, the conversations were long and fragmented.
              
              "To circumvent this problem, we conducted more practical lessons so that the Afghan instructors could learn through first-hand experience, and not so much the theories."
              
              Military Expert 3 (ME3) Ashok Kumar, who provided operational and logistic support, such as planning and coordinating flight arrangements, was appreciative of the Family Engagement Programme that the SAF had arranged for personnel deployed in Afghanistan.
              
              "The SAF gave us much support in keeping us in contact with our families. The Family Liaison Officers made me feel reassured, as there was someone there for my family should they encounter any problems."
              
              Fire Support Instructor, Staff Sergeant (SSG) Muhammad Bukhari Bin Suhaimi, who was deployed as part of the MIT in Kabul, shared about the invaluable cultural exchanges he had with the ANA, and the good working relations with the Australian Defence Force personnel.
              
              "Being a Muslim, I was able to understand the Afghan culture and traditions; hence I was able to interact with them more effectively," he added.
              
              Other medal recipients included National Contingent Commander Colonel (COL) Lee Wei Cheng who provided in-theatre command and control for SAF personnel in Afghanistan; two teams of 10 MITs deployed in Kabul to assist in the International Security Assistance Force's (ISAF's) effort to train the ANA; and a five-man Imagery Analyst Team deployed to Oruzgan to augment ISAF's surveillance and reconnaissance capabilities.

              Sorry for the late reply buddy. I come in whenever I have the time and when have time to reply. The Coalition and Nato Forces is schedule for withdrawal in 2014. In this case, we need to refer to precedented historical events to see what could happen. The British had scheduled to withdraw its troops from Malaysia and Singapore in the 1960s while the Communists were very much active in their campaigns to topple the ruling governments. Many political analysts had predicted that Malaysia and Singapore would fall to Communism when the British left. Well, we had proofed them and the world wrong.
                      
              To rebuild and the development of a nation is not an easy task. It will not happen overnight or a year or more to achieve that goal of a stable and prosperous nation. The Afghanistan administrations and its people will need to go through many trials and errors along that road of progress and development to reach their goals. The Afghanistan war is in its 10 years period now. However, if you compare Afghanistan 10 years ago when we just started and lets say about 3 or 5 years ago, Afghanistan is very much better now. There are many progress and developments in the country with the aid of foreign forces presence and investments from many foreign countries. There is about $1 trillions of mineral resources to be tapped there. There are also plans to have the oil and gas pipeline projects to be developed in Afghanistan. This would really help Afghanistan economy. Though the schedule of foreign forces withdrawal from Afghanistan is in 2014, the economics and military aids will continue. However, it may be a delay of full foreign troops withdrawal and we could have foreign bases in Afghanistan which it seems to be very strategic military purposes globally. I am sure the administration of Singapore and other countries will agree with my point here.

              <p>Singapore can't be compared to Afghanistan. In 1965 Malaysia was pitifully weak and dependent together with Singapore on FPDA security. Indonesia and everyone else was weak too. If they had tried anything, they would have been blockaded without a single vessel to challenge it. But every neighbour of Afghanistan is meddling in it.</p>
              <p>Singapore is small and easy to police and administer and make rapid improvements to. Chinese people are obedient, hardworking and easily influenced. As uneducated as we were in 1965, it was at least better than Afghanistan. At least we only had 4 national languages. An Afghan will never give up his personal AK-47 and who can blame him for not feeling safe without it?</p>
              <p>I don't think Afghanistan is much better now. They can't even stop farmers from growing opium because besides joining the Taliban, there is no other way to make money.</p>
              <p>Here's what happens sometimes. Afghan units are at least 20% under strength because men have no other way to send money home. Not counting deserters. Afghan units sell guns to the Taliban in exchange for a truce during their rotation. What happens to the next unit?</p>
              <p>You might say ANA units should be tied to their areas of responsibility. But being there too long is precisely what makes the ANP corrupt and it is the only reason the ANA is not as corrupt. Not long ago there was no phone service at night because the Taliban threatened the telcos with blowing up the phone towers. People were making tipoffs at night.</p>
              <p>I'm sorry but I can tell from your language that you've been reading too much on offficial US government websites. Of course these will sound optimistic.</p>
              <p>You need to read American newspapers widely. No other country's media is more interested in Afghanistan and they are a free press.</p>
