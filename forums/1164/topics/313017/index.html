              <p>More importantly, if a government were to treat it as a waste of money, it sends out a message to people that they're not worth a damn to the country.  Especially in a conscript-staffed military like Singapore's can you imagine what the NS men's attitude would be if war came?  "They don't give a fuck about us, we don't give a fuck about them - I'm outta here".</p>

              			| <em class="timestamp">March 11, 2008</em></p>
              <p>http://www.theaustralian.news.com.au/story/0,,23352078-7583,00.html?from=public_rss</p>
              <blockquote><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">It is not just the upgrade of the army's armoured vehicles, the
              modernisation of the navy's frigates or the delivery of the air force's
              airborne early warning aircraft that face cost overruns and delay:
              dozens of projects are in arrears.</span></span>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The problem is not the staff that make up the project teams, though
              staff turnover and a lack of experience and expertise impose serious
              constraints on performance. <span style="color: #ff0000;">It is a much more systemic problem th</span>at
              goes right to the heart of the capability selection, development and
              decision-making processes within the department. Failures in these
              areas are costing billions in waste and delay.</p>
              <p>With the benefit of hindsight, the 1997 decision <span style="color: #ff0000;">to abolish the
              force development and analysis division was a critical mistake.</span> Although the defence efficiency review streamlined the department
              organisationally by removing duplication, it failed to maintain a
              capacity for disciplined analysis. FDA ran the heavy rollers of its
              considerable analytical capability over all substantial acquisition
              proposals and, in consequence, was loathed by the military. With no
              friends in high places, FDA morphed into a new capability systems
              division that brought together the various ADF groups against which FDA
              had battled. It was placed under a two-star officer, then quarantined.
              The highly qualified and experienced analysts - many of them with
              defence science and advanced policy development backgrounds - dispersed
              within weeks. They have never returned.</p>
              <p>The analysis black hole is compounded by two other deficiencies.
              First, there are<span style="color: #ff0000;"> fundamental weaknesses in the Defence Department's
              decision-making systems.</span> While decision support systems are normal in
              high-performing corporations and businesses, the department has yet to
              acquire one. Consequently, there is no capacity for decision audits,
              rendering it impossible to establish who made what decision and when.</p>
              <p>Moreover, project implementation against predetermined performance
              yardsticks cannot be monitored accurately. Generally, decisions are
              made in committee, with key players - often the service chiefs -
              exercising a right of veto as they modify capability specifications or
              just stall projects by calling for reviews, studies and other nugatory
              work with which they can bamboozle a minister.</p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">Second, the department has almost no capacity for risk modelling, evaluation and mitigation. </span></p>
              <p>In Australia, there is no other organisation that deals with the
              complexity of technological, systems and human interfaces such as those
              that distinguish the Defence Department's key acquisitions.</p>

              <blockquote>
              <p>What was done or not done that led to the outcome on Seasprite? What
                  processes led to the ordering of the Super Hornet? On what strategic
                  basis was the Abrams tank purchased? And what has been the rationale
                  for purchasing the F-35 off the plan with all the delays and cost
                  blowouts that can be expected? Wasn't the experience of the F-111
                  enough? And what is the thinking behind the construction of the
                  airwarfare destroyers and where are they likely to be effectively
                  deployed? Why are submarines unmanned?</p>
              <p>Why is Australia
                  purchasing such expensive military hardware? Putting aside the
                  political need to rush to the side of the US in its military adventures
                  as the apparent cost of our insurance, where are we planning to use
                  this hardware and for what purpose?</p>

              <p>I think the Austrailan military are at the very least a lot smarter then some of our local military planners, here's why:</p>
              <p>1) they do not intend to crash UAVs into things</p>
              <p>2) they do not train their troops to fight urban warfare in inline skates and carry their rifles uselessly in battle by the scope handle to "run/skate for their lives"</p>
              <p>3) they do not use 250 ton rated UAFs for 30 Megaton blast applications</p>
              <p>and of course:</p>
              <p>4) they do not try to launch non-STOVL aircraft from LHDs <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Cartoon/teeth.png" alt="teeth.png"><img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Cartoon/teeth.png" alt="teeth.png"><img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Cartoon/teeth.png" alt="teeth.png"><img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Cartoon/teeth.png" alt="teeth.png"></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Seriously, if these are the kind of ideas our local military "innovator" like lionnoisy is churning out, there's really no need to even consider the rest of his threads... I seriously doubt they make any sense.</p>
              <p>In his kind of world, even if there is a single bolt or nut lose in a tank or ship, a military is totally incapable of fighting... but I suspect the only lose nuts and bolts are in his head.</p>

The appellate judge at the High Court upheld the conviction, holding that (1) the vessels were approaching each other so as to involve a risk of collision under Rule 14(a) of the Collision Regulations; (2) "RSS Courageous" made a series of alterations to port in breach of the Collision Regulations; (3) the ANL Indonesia’s reaction, although negligent, did not break the chain of causation and (4) the trainee OOW had to be held to the same standard as a reasonably competent and qualified OOW.</span></span></strong><span style='font-size: 11.5pt; color: #333333; font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; '> </span></p>

This brought her against the flow of traffic, including the "ANL Indonesia", which was coming in the opposite direction. The Closest Point of Approach ("CPA") alarm on the radar was activated, indicating that the closest distance at which the "Courageous" would pass the "ANL Indonesia" was approximately three cables (0.3 nautical miles). Upon being informed, erroneously, by the bridge team that the "ANL Indonesia" was on the starboard side of "Courageous", the trainee OOW - who had control of the steering - ordered a series of alterations to port. The "ANL Indonesia" was in fact on the port side of the "Courageous" and the alterations brought the two vessels even closer together. The "ANL Indonesia" made two alterations to starboard by autopilot  in reaction. Rule 14(a) of the Merchant Shipping (Prevention of Collisions at Sea) Regulations ("the Collision Regulations") provides that:-</span></p>

The district judge convicted the OOW and the trainee OOW under section 304A, for causing death by a negligent act not amounting to culpable homicide. The two lieutenants were jointly responsible for negligently navigating the "Courageous" in an unsafe manner across the path of the "ANL Indonesia". The district judge’s findings included the following:</span></p>

              <li class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt; line-height: normal;    "><span style='font-size: 12pt; font-family: "Times New Roman","serif"; '>The "Courageous" had technically contravened rule 10(b)(i) of the Collision Regulations requiring a vessel in a traffic separation scheme to proceed in the general direction of traffic flow. As this manoeuvre was safe and operationally necessary, the accused were not negligent in doing so, but the onus was on them to take extra precautions to avoid a close-quarters situation with other vessels proceeding in the right direction. Given that this was a head-on situation at night with a large vessel, the CPA of three cables was unsafe as the "Courageous" should have kept a greater buffer to take contingencies into account. </span></li>

By altering to port, they had negligently breached rule 14(a) of the Collision Regulations. </span></li>

However, the actions of the "ANL Indonesia" were not so unreasonable as to eclipse the accuseds’ initial negligence, which was causative of the collision and the resulting deaths. </span></li>
