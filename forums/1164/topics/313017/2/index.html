                                      of the air force's airborne early warning aircraft that face cost
                                      overruns and delay: dozens of projects are in

              <p> </p>
              <p>The problem is not the staff that make up the project teams,
                                      though staff turnover and a lack of experience and expertise impose
                                      serious constraints on performance. <span style="color: #ff0000;">It is a much more systemic problem th</span>at

              <p><br>But you must admit it is kinda fun pwning him because he actually tries to argue his point despite showing to everyone that he not only lacks the required knowledge, but also a big deal of common sense as well... which is not really surprising for him given he is far less interested in logic and more in making anything military by Singapore look good, to the point of crashing Fantail and inline skate force.</p>
              <p>Ironically, he is making Singapore look really, really bad.</p>

              <p><br>The difference is people can remember and make sense of it:</p>
              <p>There is something seriously wrong with the SAF- anybody who served in NS before can tell you.</p>
              <p>The difference here is you can't, choosing to call repeated incidents that happen year after year after year "isloated incidents"</p>
              <p>Is a entire training issue that drowned a soldier that was actually wrong issued to batches (hundreds or thousands of trainees trained wrongly) an "isloated" incident?</p>
              <p>Was an old, unworkable and outdated design millions was spent on a light tank on which the lives of their crews and the soldiers (thousands of soldiers) depended on an "isloated" incident?</p>
              <p>Is hiring an unqualified raceboat person to teach coast guard interdiction methods (hundreds trained in wrong method) an "isolated" incident?</p>
              <p>Is a terrorist leader managing to escape from Singapore's high security and EVADE detection and capture by the full might of Singapore's "advanced" security an "isloated" incident?</p>
              <p>These things are possible because of the result of long standing systemic failures in Singapore's defence. Even the book Defending the Lion City pointed it out: While impressive on paper, the SAF seems to be more red tape and covering things up then warriors.</p>
              <p>There's on isloated incident I think, and that is the general level of intelligence you display in your posts in here... I don't really think I see it commonly or it having any link with reality.</p>

                  only lacks the required knowledge, but also a big deal of common

                  far less interested in logic and more in making anything military

              <p>I like your analogy of his climbing up a tree wearing his underwear on his head because it's perfectly apt.  he's coming up with all kinds of boneheaded ideas to suggest something a different way of doing something, but without any purpose whatsoever.  The irony here is that he's so completely immersed in his wacky fantasy land that he completely fails to see the purpose behind things being done by people doing the real work.</p>
              <p>I suppose it's amusing in a buffoonish way - he really is SGF's answer to Homer Simpson, isn't he?  Well, without Homer's saving graces at least.</p>

              <p>I really love his attempt to sound all military by trying really hard to come up with some situtation in which a grunt needs to run for his life holding his SAR by the scope handle! And in the end he concluded that a scope handle is good in a situtation in which you need to cross open ground for 50 meters under heavy enemy fire when any grunt who has been in training can tell you that even if you had no weapon and was in PT kit and sprinting at full speed you'll most probably be dead.</p>
              <p>And of course there is also the issue that lionnoisy simply ignored or pretended that didn't exist was that the FASTEST way to run with your rifle was to hold it close to your body and sprint, not dangle it at the end of one arm like a shopping bag via the scope handle.</p>
              <p>Of course I love it how the way he glosses over everything of the TAR-21 that was better then the SAR-21 basic and kept on looking a the scope handle, which no grunt who used the SAR-21 even cared about in the first place.</p>
              <p>Seriously this guy simply does not know anything! <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Cartoon/teeth.png" alt="teeth.png"></p>

              <p>Let's see... when I was in NS, I was one of those who were tasked to hammer little wooden boards in sec schs in rows and columns so that the little kids can practise performing</p>
              <p>Also, being in the BRC, I have seen many military bike related incidents and accidents... Just the training course alone, those who took with me (totalled around 20+), 2 went OOC because of heavy injuries sustained, with one person having broken his arm (can see bone jutting out) and one having fractured his leg.</p>
              <p>And also, just by carrying the field pack of all the equipments and walking super long distance, a number of my fellow mates had injured their lower back till they have to downgrade, some had their knees worn out too.</p>
              <p>Not to mention finally that my POW training course was the course just before the one that killed that Sgt...</p>
              <p>Of course, these do not cost much waste and delay. The best compensation that SAF can give to these people is a downgrade from active duty. How much does that cost?</p>
