            <div class='col-md body'>CV90 TRACKED ARMOURED COMBAT VEHICLES, SWEDEN<br><br>Combat Vehicle 90 represents a family of armoured combat vehicles developed by BAE Systems Land Systems Hagglunds (formerly Alvis HÃ¤gglunds) of Ã–rnskÃ¶ldsvik and Saab Bofors Dynamics of Karlskoga, Sweden. Land Systems HÃ¤gglunds builds the chassis and Saab Bofors supplies the turret.<br><br>The development of the CV90 began in 1984 in response to the requirements outlined by the Swedish Army for a family of armoured combat vehicles with high tactical and strategic mobility, air defence and anti-tank capability, high survivability and protection. Production began in 1993 and over 1,125 vehicles have been ordered. The CV90 is in service with the armies of Sweden, Norway, Switzerland and Finland.<br><br>SELF-PROTECTION<br><br>The all-welded steel hull can be upgraded with add-on armour, which protects against 30mm APFSDS (armour piercing fin-stabilised discarding sabot) rounds. The vehicle has low radar, acoustic and infrared signature. A fire detection and extinguishing system is fitted and full nuclear, chemical and biological (NBC) protection is provided.<br>CV90 INFANTRY FIGHTING VEHICLE<br><br>The CV90 Infantry Fighting Vehicle is compatible with a range of armaments, sights and fire control systems to suit the mission requirement. All versions carry a crew of three: commander, driver and gunner, together with up to eight soldiers.<br><br>Versions of the CV90 IFV include the CV9040 with 40mm gun and the export variant, the CV9030 with 30mm gun. The CV9040 has been in service with the Swedish army since 1993 with nearly 500 systems delivered and is armed with a 40mm Bofors L/70 cannon. Final deliveries were completed in September 2002.<br><br>The sighting systems of a number of Swedish CV9040 vehicles are to be upgraded with an LIRC thermal imaging system from FLIR Systems of Portland, Oregon. LIRC is based on QWIP (Quantum Well Infrared Photodetector) technology. Deliveries of the new sights are planned from 2004 to 2005.<br><br>In March 2005, Saab Systems was selected to develop a battlefield management system for Swedish Army CV9040 vehicles. Deliveries are due to begin in 2007.<br><br>The CV9030 has been operational with the Norwegian Army since 1995 (104 vehicles). It is armed with a 30mm ATK Ammunition Systems (formerly Boeing Ordnance) Bushmaster II cannon. The CV9030 Mk II has been ordered by the Swiss Army, which requires 186 vehicles for delivery by 2005. The Swiss vehicle is called the Grenadier Tank 2000 and the first was delivered in September 2002. The 9030 Mk II is fitted with an ATK 30mm/40mm Bushmaster II Mk 44 cannon, SaabTech UTAAS anti-aircraft sight and the digital Hagglunds Vehicle Control System (HVCS). HVCS includes a video network system with displays at each crew station and vehicle built-in test system. It can be extended with a battlefield management system and the Hagglunds Defensive Aids Suite (HDAS). Finland has also ordered 57 CV9030 Mk II vehicles, out of a total requirement of 150. Patria Hagglunds (a joint venture company) is building the vehicle turrets and the first was delivered in April 2002. A second contract for 45 vehicles was placed in June 2004.<br><br>In September 2003, Land Systems Hagglunds received a contract from the Norwegian Army to upgrade 17 CV9030N vehicles to CV9030S configuration. The upgraded vehicles will have an additional mine protection kit, new air-cooling system and rear view camera.<br><br>Patria Hagglunds has been awarded a contract to integrate the AMOS (Advanced Mortar System) on a Swedish Army CV90 infantry fighting vehicle. The AMOS twin 120mm mortar system has a direct fire capability and a digital, computerised fire control system, which can fire a variety of mortar bombs including the Strix "smart" mortar, developed by Saab Bofors Dynamics. In December 2002, AMOS was shortlisted as a candidate for the US Future Combat System program.<br><br>In December 2004, the Netherlands signed a contract for 184 CV9035 Mk III vehicles for delivery between 2007 and 2010. Van Halteren Metaal of the Netherlands will be responsible for turret assembly and integration. The CV9035 Mk III features a Bushmaster III 35/50 cannon, Saab UTAAS fire control system with ammunition programmer, a rotating cupola that provides hunter-killer capability and commander and gunner stabilised day/night sights with third generation thermal cameras. The Mk III has a new armour package with increased protection against top-attack weapons and mines and is fitted with HÃ¤gglunds' defensive aids suite (DAS) with laser warner and smoke grenades.<br>CV90120-T TANK<br><br>The CV90120-T is a light tank which has a Hagglund turret mounted on the latest CV90 chassis. RUAG Land Systems of Switzerland has developed the fully stabilised 120 mm high pressure smoothbore CTG 120/L50 gun, which has a rate of fire of up to 14 rounds per minute. SaabTechSystems of Sweden has developed the fire control system, UTAAS, and the Panoramic Low Signature commanderÂ’s sight, which give the tank hunter/killer capability. The tankÂ’s Battlefield Management System is based on fully integrated, scalable and open electronic architecture and a video network with displays at each crew station.<br><br>The tankÂ’s Defensive Aids Suite (DAS) includes laser, radar and missile approach warners, as well as a MSA (Multi-Spectral Aerosols) active countermeasure system with top attack radar that can identify smart indirect munitions. Survivability is further enhanced by the stealth turret design and radar absorbing track skirts.<br>CV9040 ANTI AIRCRAFT VEHICLE<br><br>The CV9040 Anti Aircraft Vehicle has been in service with the Swedish Army (27 vehicles) since 1995. It is fitted with a Thales TRS 2620 reconnaissance radar and automatic threat evaluation. The vehicle is capable of engaging aerial targets, including helicopters, at ranges up to 4,000m. It is fitted with SaabTech Vectronics UTAAS anti-aircraft gun sight for the Bofors 40mm L/70 cannon, which includes a thermal imager, laser rangefinder and fire control computer.<br>CV90 FORWARD OBSERVATION VEHICLE<br><br>The CV90 Forward Observation Vehicle is equipped with an enhanced sighting system, incorporating a laser rangefinder for target detection and acquisition. The vehicle has improved communication and navigation systems. The turret has a 7.62 machine gun.<br>CV90 FORWARD COMMAND VEHICLE<br><br>The CV90 Forward Command Vehicle is a mobile combat C3 (command, control and communications) vehicle equipped with advanced communication and command equipment. The turret is fitted with a 7.62mm general purpose machine gun.<br><br>The command vehicle provides accommodation for a crew of three, and additional workstations for mission crew.<br>CV90 ARMOURED RECOVERY VEHICLE<br><br>The CV90 Armoured Recovery Vehicle is operated by a crew of four and is capable of applying a 72t line-pull in any direction. The cupola is armed with a 7.62 machine gun. Recovery operations are carried out using two Rotzler hydraulic winches and a hydraulically operated crane. A dozer blade is fitted on the front of the vehicle.</div>
