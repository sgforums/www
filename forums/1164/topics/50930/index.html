A is making a move on you. You want to fight back but according to the Rules of Engagement, you are not authorised to shoot back until you are fired upon. That means that you cannot retaliate until it is confirmed that A has launched its missile or fired its cannon against you. Even if you have been locked-on on A's HUD, that does not indicate that you can retaliate...<br><br>By the way, if you watch the first part of 'Top Gun', you get some idea of it...</div>

I think some heads are gonna roll in Indonesia upper ranks for this gaffe..."<br><br>Looks like red tape issue leh.......People already requested permission, yet, no reply....and the moment you close in to US carrier battle group, obviously they do have defenders protecting their assets and as a result Indons became intruders....(the other way round) !!!!</div>
