The pond was algae laden with plans to de-algae it being continually shelved aside due to "lack of resources" and deemed "not an operational requirement"... Not to mention that we ourselves had to patch a hole @ a time (before it was thoroughly cemented) to solve the leaking problem..<br><br>However shock there was in the morning, we could only sigh...<br>The former CO would have jumped on all of us if he found the fishes like this...Good thing he was gone already...<br><br>But the pond was a great part of the former School... I believe there's another unit with a similar pond...SOAY? Anyone verify this?</div>
