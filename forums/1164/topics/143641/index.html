            <div class='col-md body'>I heard there are many such militias in the US. The Michigan one is the most publicised. But there are many more , most are much smaller. They all interpret and rely on the Constitution that all individuals have a right to defend themselves. In Texas, they even have a right to bear arms.<br><br>Over here in Europe, there are such groups but not so organised or public. Some in fact have become terrorist organisations (the more well known in the past include the Red Brigade and the IRA and Loyalists).  the more recent and active include September 14 and Al-Qaeda.  But trust me, there are neo-Nazi groups who may be armed to some extent around in Europe.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>It is in the consitution that the right to bear arms should not be infringe.<br><br>But many Communist state like California, New York, and other democrat States have the strongest and most stringent gun law ! people there have to get special permit to buy guns and in some places like New York City , law abiding citizen cannot buy guns without a special permit which is almost very difficult to get.  And thru statistics ! these States have the highest crime rate.<br><br>Comming to the more conservative states like Texas, Arizona, Florida,... we have conceal carrying permit that civilian can got take a class, get their background check and than qualify with a test ... with the lisence again ... crime rate went down.<br><br>Anyway, the whole of US has the right to bear arms, its the state law that prevent ordinary people to defend themsilve with firearms ! but criminal can easily access to illegal firearms!<br><br>POlice force is also severly limited in ttheir response due to the vast areas and land they need to patrol.... thus law abiding and responsible citizen having firearms can in someitimes help them equalized in a bad situation/<br><br>Guys! its just a differnt society, mind set and environement.<br><br>DaveC</div>

Woodring had killed a Michigan State Police officer a week earlier during an armed standoff.</strong><br><br>Authorities received a tip revealing Woodring's current location, in a car parked behind a house some four miles from his home in Newaygo County. A SWAT team was sent to the location, where they found Woodring asleep in the vehicle.<br><br>Police ordered Woodring to remain in the car, but he emerged carrying an assault rifle. When he turned to face the officers, they fired at him.<br><br>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br><br>Updated: July 9, 2003<br>Michigan Militia Standoff Update<br>An all-points-bulletin was issued by the Michigan State Police on July 9, 2003, for Scott Alan Woodring, the Michigan militia member who allegedly shot and killed a Michigan State Trooper during an armed standoff in Fremont in western Michigan.<br><br>Authorities decided to force an end to the standoff on the afternoon of July 8, using armored vehicles on loan from the Michigan National Guard to approach Woodring's house so that percussion grenades could be launched into the building. Two grenades were detonated, shortly after which the building caught fire and was rocked by explosions.<br><br>Woodring was originally thought to have been in the building when it burned down. However, a search of the building's remains failed to turn up any evidence of Woodring. Michigan State Police now believe he may have left his home as early as Monday afternoon. A backpack filled with food and ammunition was found on July 8, three quarters of a mile from Woodring's home. Woodring's wife has reportedly identified it as belonging to her husband.<br><br>A warrant for Woodring's arrest has been issued on murder and firearms charges.<br><br>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br><br>Posted: July 8, 2003<br>A Michigan Militia member killed a Michigan State Police trooper on July 7, 2003, in a standoff with authorities in Newaygo County in western Michigan. The trooper, Kevin Marshall, was an eight-year veteran of the Michigan State Police and part of the State Emergency Response Unit.<br><br>The standoff began July 6, when police officers from Hesperia, Michigan, and the Newaygo County Sheriff's Department attempted to serve Scott Woodring, a longtime Michigan Militia member, with a warrant for criminal sexual conduct. Woodring barricaded himself inside his home and refused to come out, warning officers that he had a gun.<br><br>Once a standoff developed, authorities attempted to negotiate with Woodring, described by his family as a "non-violent member" of the Michigan Militia who does not trust the government. However, on the second day, police tried to enter the home to apprehend Woodring, firing tear gas into the building, then entering.<br><br>Woodring shot at the officers, lightly wounding one man and hitting Marshall in his side, in an area unprotected by his bulletproof vest. Marshall was taken to a hospital and died during surgery.<br><br>Woodring is a longtime member of the Michigan Militia and an adherent of the anti-government sovereign citizen movement. A follower of Michigan Militia founder Norm Olson, Woodring ran for township supervisor in Dayton Township in 1995 on a platform modeled after the beliefs of the Montana Freemen, getting 10 percent of the primary vote.<br><br>The following year, Woodring tried to organize a "township" in Newaygo County, running newspaper ads to promote a "Committee for a De Jure Township." Members of the anti-government sovereign citizen movement often try to create their own "townships" to escape the jurisdiction of the government. The Montana Freemen created "Justus Township" during their standoff with federal authorities in 1996. In 1983, Posse Comitatus leader Gordon Kahl was leaving a meeting to create such a "township" when he killed two U.S. Marshals trying to apprehend him.<br><br>Also in 1996, Woodring was involved in Norm Olsen's attempt to create a national militia gathering he dubbed the "Third Continental Congress." Woodring was part of the Michigan Militia delegation to the event.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Michigan Militia Member Sentenced<br><br>Posted: March 30, 2005<br><br><strong><br><br>A Michigan militia member accused of plotting to kill police has been sentenced to over 6 years in prison for federal weapons violations.<br><br>Norman David Somerville, 44, was sentenced in federal court in Grand Rapids on March 24 for possessing and distributing 13 machine guns.  ATF Special Agent Valerie J. Goddard said “Somerville intended to kill Michigan State Police Officers and had the machine guns and ammunition to do so.”  </strong><br><br>Authorities allege that Somerville and other militia members were planning to kill police officers in retaliation for the fatal shooting of Michigan militia member Scott Allen Woodring in July 2003 by state police.  Woodring killed a Michigan State Police officer during an armed standoff and was killed in a later encounter with police.  Prosecutors claimed Somerville was going to deliberately crash a vehicle mounted with a machine gun, then fire on police officers responding to the accident.<br><br>Somerville has been behind bars since being arrested at a Home Depot in Cadillac in October 2003.  During a search of Somerville’s compound at that time, agents discovered an underground bunker, thousands of rounds of ammunition, hundreds of pounds of gunpowder and manuals on guerrilla warfare and explosives.<br><br>Somerville was also fined $2,000.  Two accomplices, Donald Koshmider and Jeffrey Horvath, earlier pleaded guilty on related charges.<br><br></div>
