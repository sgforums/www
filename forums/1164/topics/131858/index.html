            <div class='col-md body'>JC's got a point about discrimination in recruitment.  Allow me to expand.<br><br>First, in countries like the US, the law clearly falls on the side of the job applicant, rather than the recruiter.  Should the applicant fail to get the job, he  or she can legally challenge the decision.  Once that happens, the onus is clearly upon the recruiter to justify the decision based strictly upon the requirements of the job.<br><br>Over the years, Australia has been adopting the American model.  Hell, I ought to know - as a recruiter for six years, I made some reasonably good money ensuring that my clients could brush off any legal challenges to their hiring decisions.<br><br>I'm not implying any ignorance on your part, lwflee, but the situation in countries like the US is vastly different from that in Singapore.  For example, were a US recruiter to put, "Only successful applicants will be notified" in a job ad (as is common practice in Singapore), he'd be strung up by the balls before he could call his lawyer.<br><br>Second, the US Army has been using structured testing and interviewing for its recruitment purposes since 1917.  With all of their test data, plus the fact that many of their war heroes like Audie Murphy are not highly educated, any half-competent lawyer could successfully argue in court that academic or intellectual performance has little, if any, to do with combat effectiveness.  Lyndie England's language disabilities do not constitute the general intellectual disability which would be needed to justify a decision not to take her into the Army.<br><br>To summarise, with the way the law is weighted in the applicant's favour, plus the existing data that supports the case of combat effectiveness in the absence of academic performance, John's assessment of the situation vis-a-vis the discrimination law is correct.</div>
