There was a case of Mcdonald being sued for customer getting fat, I think it was related to kids, anyway I was tempted to sued MC too.  But after some legal calculations, it wouldn't have been worth the effort to do so.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br><br>My friend did sue a dentist for pulling out a decayed tooth that he didn't request for, he wanted another tooth to be removed but the dentist judged that the other decayed tooth was in urgent need of removal &amp; so removed it for my friend.  My friend could've lost his case in court had it not being for his lawyer who threw in other problems my friend <strong>supposely</strong> encountered after the removal of the wrong tooth.  The judge knew my friend's case was B.S but he awarded him the damages on the grounds that the dentist did not informed my friend inadvance about why he chose to remove the other tooth. So, after settling all the legal fees &amp; necessary fees for the case, my friend earned U.S$200.  Not bad, huh!  Only in America!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"></div>

Though what Iwflee posted was not as serious as the Guantanamo's case, I don't think its far of him to abuse the reputation of the U.S Army base on news allegations that have yet to be proven to be true.  I'm not paid to defend the good name of the U.S Army but I do think its unfair to the troops suffer bad rep over such allegations.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_neutral.gif" alt="Neutral" title="Neutral"></div>
