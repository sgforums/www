But an interesting note is that our AMX-13 75mm gun was developed from a WW2 german tank gun, probably Panther or something.)<br><br>There is a VAST difference in the ammo available to the SAF AMX-13 comppared to WW2. We have the kind of modern armour-piercing rounds that has a head like a hypothermic needle - a rod for punching thru armour. But still, they are useless against modern MBT. The global standard is now 120mm - nearly twice the size of the 75mm gun.<br><br>Other than Bloodhound missiles, I even saw a fleet of really old jet fighters from the 60's at  one of our airbases. They look like Strikemaster but much older. They are under wraps so I can't really identify them. Look like those 1950's planes with really sexy names like Sabre or Mystere etc...<br><br>Probably, along with the Bloodhounds, they are there as decoys.</div>

But Israel did not bother to upgrade her AMX-13 armament but instead retired them from service. (They did perform other modifications to the engine, transmission etc. But not the gun.)<br><br>My guess is that the IDF realised after several wars that light tanks are not gonna make it home on the battlefield. The armour is too thin. If I'm not wrong, until today, the IDF does not operate any light tanks.<br><br>It is not just the matter of the gun calibre when it comes to armour warfare with the Israeli.<br><br>What they value ABOVE ALL ELSE is crew survivability.<br><br>During the Yom Kippur War nearly every tank that went into action was hit at least once.  More than half of the crews survived hits to their tanks. More than half the tanks were able to be repaired and returned to service.<br><br>I highly doubt that if an AMX-13 is hit, much of it will be left.</div>
