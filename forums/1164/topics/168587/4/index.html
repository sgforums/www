            <div class='col-md body'>A few interesting points were brought up.  Esp those on the KC-135s refueling F-16s from deep-strikes.<br><br>The KC-135 would be classified as High value asset, since it directly affects our ability to keep planes in the air.  The winner of any air campaign is basically the side that can keep his planes flying as long as possible.<br><br>Refueling F-16s from those really long rides, means the tankers would have to be stationed closer to the enemy.  A sneaky counter-strike can result in the loss of these high value assets.<br><br>I agree with Fett that the "strikers" themselves cannot be the blockers.  In fact, the chances of a close knife fight breaking out while on a "deep strike" package is definitely higher than that happening on a "sweep" passage.  Strike packages of these natures sometimes requires the aircraft to fly a very narrow corridor, below a certain altitude.  They are commited on a flight path where it is possible to predict and ambush.<br><br>And of course, if that happens, the flight is quite screwed.<br><br>But here is where the strike eagle shines.  As the strike eagle flies, its radar, which is capable to scanning both air to air and groun quickly is put on standby.  Every once in a while, it can make an almost instantaneous single sweep to gain a quick air to air or ground picture.<br><br>This part is shaky, and im not sure.  Given the previous air to air picture, they can continue on til they come into a position where its favorable to launch an AMRAAM at the nearest threat.  (preferably between r2min and r2max while radar is on standby), sweep the sky again for the same target, lock on n shoot.<br><br>The target would have very little warning, and would have an AMRAAM hounding it already.<br><br>The Strike eagle can then use its active counter measures to its target.<br><br>This simply means that the strike eagle is capable of protecting itself while heading to and fro the target.  Not really self-escorting, but good enough.<br><br>Our current F-16s doesn't really specialise itself in such away.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>F-15SG<br>From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia.<br>Jump to: navigation, search<br><br>The F-15SG (ex F-15T) is a variant of the U.S Air Force's F-15E Strike Eagle, currently ordered by the Republic of Singapore Air Force (RSAF) after a seven-year evaluation period involving five other fighter aircraft under consideration. The F-15SG was chosen on 6 September 2005 over the only remaining aircraft still in contention, the Dassault Rafale.<br><br>The F-15SG is similar in configuration to the F-15K sold and being delivered to South Korea, but differs in the addition of the APG-63(V)3 active electronically scanned array radar developed by Raytheon. Pending news on Lockheed Martin’s F-35's progress, the RSAF has placed an order of 12 aircraft with an option for 8 more to replace its A-4SUs. The purchase is part of the New Fighter Replacement Program, worth about US$1 billion and which will be the most expensive single fighter aircraft purchase by the RSAF.<br><br>On 22 August 2005, the US Defense Security Cooperation Agency (DSCA) notified US Congress about a potential Foreign military sales (FMS) of weapons, logistics and training in the event that the Boeing F-15 was selected by Singapore. Since the F-15 purchase has now been confirmed, it can be assumed that Singapore will follow up on this proposed weapons and logistics package, worth a further US$741 million dollars if all options are exercised.<br><br>Weapons in this package include:<br>200 AIM-120C Advanced Medium Range Air-to-Air Missiles (AMRAAM)<br>6 AMRAAM Captive Air Training (CAT) Missiles<br>50 MK-82 GBU-38 Joint Direct Attack Munitions (JDAM) w/BLU-111 warhead<br>44 AN/AVS-9(V) Night Vision Goggles<br>24 Link 16 Multifunctional Information Distribution System/Low Volume Terminals (Fighter Data Link Terminals)<br>30 AGM-154A-1 (JSOW) Joint Standoff Weapons with BLU-11 warheads<br>30 AGM-154C (JSOW) Joint Standoff Weapons<br>200 AIM-9X SIDEWINDER Missiles<br>24 AIM-9X SIDEWINDER CAT and Dummy Missiles</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Quoted fr http://www.defenseindustrydaily.com/,,11.01.2006<br><br>''Singapore Chooses GE's F110 for its F-15 Strike Eagles<br>Posted 11-Jan-2006 04:30 | Permanent Link<br>Related stories: Asia - Other, Contracts - Intent, Engines - Aircraft, Fighters &amp; Attack, Other Corporation<br>AIR_F-15E_Firing.jpg<br>F-15 Strike Eagle<br>(click to view full)<br><br>The government of Singapore has selected the GE F110 fighter engine to power its 12-20 new Boeing F-15SG Strike Eagle aircraft. Engine deliveries for the firm order of 12 aircraft will occur in 2008-2009. The Singapore selection of the F110-GE-129 (rated at 29,000 pounds thrust) is the second F-15 aircraft selection for the popular fighter engine. The Republic of Korea (ROKAF) selected the engine to power its 40 F-15K Slam Eagle aircraft and began taking deliveries in October 2005.<br><br>As DID's recent coverage of potential cuts to the F-35 JSF program's engine choices (P&amp;W F135 or GE/RR F136) noted, the GE F110 was developed as an engine alternative to Pratt &amp; Whitney's original F100, and has since become very popular in F-16s due to its higher thrust. Most of the USAF current F-16 fleet currently flies with GE F110 engines, for instance. Despite extensive US F-15E trials in 1999, however, almost all F-15s worldwide use the P&amp;W F100 engine. Al DiLibero, vice president of the F110 program at GE, sees these two recent wins as big plusses. Engines, like airframes, have service lives, and replacement or upgrade programs could well lead to growth possibilities re-engining mature F-15 aircraft already in service.<strong><a href="http://www.geae.com/aboutgeae/presscenter/military/military_20060104.html" rel="nofollow"> See corporate release.''</a></strong><br><br>2.<img src="http://www.geae.com/engines/military/images/engines_f110_ge_129.jpg"><br><strong><a href="http://www.geae.com/engines/military/f110/index.html" rel="nofollow">Details of F11o engine</a></strong><br><blockquote>The latest F110, the F110-GE-132 continues to be delivered to Lockheed Martin and flight testing on<strong> the F-16E/F aircraft is underway.</strong></blockquote></div>
