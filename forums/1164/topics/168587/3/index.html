To maintain the element of surprise, such a deep strike package would HAVE to be "self-escortin" in order not to tip off the enemy.<br><br>The F-15E packs perhaps one of the most powerful and advanced Tactical Electronic Warfare System available for an attack air craft.  Its rumored to be so effective that the pilots are only allowed to use it in real combat situations.  The jamming signal is touted to be so powerful that it can not only cause harm to the equipments jammed, but to the operator as well.  How that works, I am not too sure...<br><br>If its just the normal deep strike, and the enemy knows u're coming.   Naturally a SEAD escort package and escort package would have to be tagged together with the strike.<br><br>Can the F-16C/D fulfill such a role?  Yes, but at a shorter range.  The longer the range, the lesser the payload.. hardpoints occupied by fuel tanks.<br><br>But the F-15E or SG is supposed to be able to carry a lot of payload, AND hit very long distances.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Seriously, the Pk of BVR missiles these days are very high. An adversary with knowledge of the possible weapons/ WEZ of these weapons would definitely try to stay out of your possible engagement envelope. Besides, with the Amraam you may not get possible warning on the enemy's RWR, so unless they are very sure, they'd prob try to stay away from the threat.<br>If they manage to thrash the BVR missiles at range, they'd still have to notch into the fight as the range gets closer, i.e they shud be in a slightly defensive posture. That should be a worst case scenario if they F15 can't attrite them at range and have to end up in a dogfight which of course any smart pilot would jettison their external stores and then merge with the enemy. So if the F15 is in clean config, I think they'd be a tough fight for anyone.</div>

As i said, BVR missiles these days like the AIM-120C/D series and the R-77/AA-12 series have a very high Pk as long as you're between the missile's Rmax2 and Rmin2 launch zones. These missiles also have home on jam capability, hence jamming isn't really useful, and their ECCM capabilities are far more advanced than vietnam war era AIM-7s. Hence BVR combat will be conducted on the basis that whoever fires first has the upper hand, as the firing aircraft can leave the engagement as soon as the missile goes autonomous or even before that.<br><br>Of course, the only thing that might hold that back are the rules of engagement in that particular theatre.

            <div class='col-md body'>I agree that it is really a tough call when it comes to BVR.  First of all, the BVR fight today is likened to a boxer, slugging out at their longest reach.  Both would take very bad beatings cos of the high pk of the missiles.<br><br>However it is also very hard to force a merge since both sides would normally opt for a very conservative BVR fight.  In a "chainsaw", both flights would launch and leave at near the max range.  Opportunities to merge are simply not there.</div>

The RSAF requires 60-80 new combat aircraft (though possibly as many as 100) in the long term to replace the now retired A-4SU/TA-4SU strike aircraft and F-5S/T light fighters to be retired by 2015.<br><br>In fact, besides the option of 8 more aircraft, a follow-up order of 20 or even 40 F-15SG is a must if the RSAF is to avoid the danger of a dwindling and aging inventory due to the large numbers of aircraft to be retired.<br><br>It worries me as to whether the RSAF would be able to maintain its lead over potential adversaries with just 12 F-15SG? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_idea.gif" alt="Idea" title="Idea"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Kinematicallly defeating a missile at range, to keep it simple, basically you manouevre such that the missile will never touch you. Simply because the missile has finite energy. The WEZ/Rmax/DLZ1 of the missile changes based on the aspect of the enemy, whether he is head on or not. For example, a shot taken at Rmax, the enemy simply just has to change his heading for example a few degrees or just beam the missile, it will already shrink the WEZ significantly. Missiles fly proportional navigation, so a shot taken at MAX range would have to assume that the enemy just continues on his heading at the instance the missile was off the rail.<br><br>Modern air combat, you don't have to shoot down the guy to win a war, just keep him tied down. Sweepers only need to tie down the Cappers, maybe draw them away/ push them away from the strike package, at the end of the day, if they don't shoot down anyone but the strike package gets throught. Mission is accomplished.<br><br>And seriously BVR is the way to go. dogfights are a thing of the past, its a last ditch thingy if you can't disengage and have to merge, coz with current technology missiles are extremely lethal, no matter how manoeuverable your aircraft maybe, its kind of difficult to outmanouevre a missile. You can only create angle problems for it, but most of the time in a dogfight the missile's gonna get you. They'll prob have flare rejection capabliity anyway.</div>
