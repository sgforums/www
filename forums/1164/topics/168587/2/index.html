            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by Fatum:</div><div class="quote_body">designating planes for escort role is actually resource intensive, you'd have seperate packages of planes, one for strike, and one to protect the strike package, that's why the USN went for the hornet, <span style="color: red;">cos it's designed as a true strike fighter from the very start of the design, so in effect it's self escorting,</span> that's what allowed them to reduce plane numbers on the aircraft carriers after the hornet went into service, you need not have tomcats escorting strike packages of intruders and cosairs anymore.<br><br>I suppose any plane that can carry A2G munitions can operate in a strike role, it's just a case of how well it performs in the role,<br><br>another thought, how does this purchase fits into our eventual JSF ambitions ? ... would the JSF be an eventual replacement for the F-5s  then ? ... </div></blockquote>I'm sorry but how do you so call 'self escort'?<br><br>Your plane is part of a strike package, meaning the ammunitions load out is essentially for strike against ground target, with a minimum for self-defense purpose. If the strike package is intercepted, it may means that you have to dump your strike munitions and cover your own ass. That would means that you fail your mission object and your enemy achieved his.<br><br>F/A designation for the F/A-18 (from A thru D) means that the plane can perform two roles, and not two roles at the same time. It is either for your CAP, interdiction or strike, and likely not at the same time.<br><br>So for any attack mission, the number of aircrafts is basically the same; meaning separate planes for protection and attack. What the F/A-18 achieves for the Navy is having the same airframe (as oppose to airplane) for two totally different missions.<br><br>So again, I donÂ’t not think there can being any possibility of being Â‘self-escortÂ’ for any airplane.<br></div>

Gun pods were brought back.<br><br>And you have not provided a solution to the issue of maneuverability.<br><br>And for the issue of AWACS, it is quite inconceivable that such a platform is missing in any mission, so weÂ’ll take it that it have to be there.
