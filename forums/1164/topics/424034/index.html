              <p>Some might call it hindsight. However, am pretty sure DSTA/mindef asked the right questions about schedules and capabilities before deciding on the F-15SG. Its either have or don't have. Otherwise, why bother to have such a long tender process?</p>
              <p>Typhoon is still well-marketed. Even to the extent that prior to the selection, someone will say that xxx bought it already. They did that in the SG comp, they did that in the EJ-200 comp for the LCA, they have done it for the Indian MRCA comp. Its so well marketed that some in mindef tot the decision was already made that an official rebuttal was needed.</p>

              <p>And if, as you posted, it had a problem using US ammo? Then what is it going to fire? An unarmed plane isn't a real threat or defence.</p>
              <p>BTW, the Typhoon design was designed for survivability through agility and speed, you need a specialised flight suit beyond the normal ones, so that is another cost point. And the physical punishment on the pilot is harsh, not sure if our pilots can use it to the full effect considering that we are generally smaller than the Europeans. The F-15 on the other hand, is more balanced in it's survivability design, i.e a mix of stealth, armour, system redundency and agility.</p>

              <p>You don't go into Top Gun dogfights, air to air is usually vollying missiles at each other then running like f-. That is the reason why our F-5s can still be used. You're not fighting the plane, you're fighting the AIM.</p>
              <p>And the F-15 carries a lot more of them on the underbelly pylons. (6 I think, assuming that the AMRAAM can be changed 1:1 for a Sparrow)</p>
              <p>It can also be tasked as a stand-in bomber, something the Typhoon has trouble doing due to it's design focus.</p>

              <p>This is wrong, the canards boost the radar signature, while the F-15 is a more "traditional" configuration. Though the difference may be slight.</p>

                  F-15 is a more "traditional" configuration. Though the difference
                  may be slight.</p>

              <p>We already operate an American/Israeli fleet, if the idea was to standardize on 2 fighter types in the long run, Typhoon would've been though. The F-15/16 have a huge amount of commonality in parts, in common with American fighters from even the A-4 era.</p>
              <p>Spain and Italy at least have large enough mixed fleets to make Typhoon worthwhile, but we were only in for 24 aircraft. Germany found the MiG-29 better than the F-16, but they sold them to Poland for $1 each and retained the F-4.</p>
              <p>Anyway, cost was a huge factor, and a strong preference for mature technologies even if better alternatives exist. There isn't a credible air threat out there.</p>

              <p>So true. Some ASAT missiles might also be an interesting research path for the -15, makes people wary of using sats to do some peeping, though it's probably a luxury buy than a serious one.</p>

              <p><br>I would like to see a Typhoon shoot a satelite down.</p>
              <p>That would not happen.</p>
              <p>You know why?</p>
              <p>I think you do.</p>
              <p>The Typhoon simply can't do it. It lacks the initial acceleration the ASAT missile needs.</p>
              <p>Its not to say the Typhoon sucks or what....it just wasn't designed to be an overkill airplane like the F-15 and F-22 were designed to be.</p>
              <p>Old aircraft like the MiG-25 and the SR-71 still hold records btw, and these records are not irrelevant today. Dare you say that the MiG-31, as an interceptor is irrelevant today? Hardly. It fills niches that even the F-15 can't do. It just isn't a dogfighter. That's all.</p>
              <p>When you consider what SG needs, and the fact that F-15 and F-16s were made to be compatible in missions and spare parts, it won't make sense to purchase the Typhoon.</p>
              <p>But I don't mind in the least if RSAF purchases one for eyecandy purposes.<img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Cartoon/teeth.png" alt="teeth.png"></p>

              <p>Yup, existing tech onboard the Typhoon isn't exactly cutting edge. Doesn't use the latest litening pod. Didn't integrate the AIM-120C-7 and a whole host of other munitions.</p>

              <p>I know the problems, just wishing. The Egyptians learnt that when they went from MiGs to F-4s, Vietnam wanted to try but US didn't let them.</p>
              <p>This is the first I've heard of the $1 cash settlement for resettling into HDB, but is consistent with current practice. Do you mean all the occupants of farms in Lim Chu Kang, Tekong, Jurong, and etc got $1 for example? When the govt acquires your land "for a public purpose", it will pay $1, and those people would still have to buy their flats. Did that happen? If not, I think it was only cos they couldn't afford it. Flats were $3000 back then but those farmers barely had tens. *Friends, please don't debate the rights and wrongs of the matter, I know we had to build a strong SAF first. I am only asking if this happened.</p>
