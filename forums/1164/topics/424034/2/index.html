              <p>Oh the British already introduced the 99 year lease long ago, to sell land at more affordable prices.</p>
              <p>Nowadays the govt can still take back 99 year leasehold land as long as they gazette it as "for a public purpose" such as road widening or building MRT. The payment is $1. You only get a valued sum if you are not on the MRT site, but within 500m from it (cos that's not for a public purpose).</p>
              <p>We were legally entitled to take part or all of the KTM railway land for $1. But Malaysia would have gone to the ICJ (like Pedra Branca) and humiliated us by getting a fair deal that we don't offer our own citizens.</p>

              <p>Yup, existing tech onboard the Typhoon isn't exactly cutting edge. Doesn't use the latest litening pod. Didn't integrate the AIM-120C-7 and a whole host of other munitions.</p>

              <p>I predict our first stealth plane may well be the J-20.</p>
              <p>1) SAF only buys mature weapons systems. When we buy the J-20, it might be 20 years from now but still good.</p>
              <p>2) China may be assertive in 20 years and expect those calling themselves "friends" to take sides. We will hedge our bets. At most, the J-20s will sit around in their hangars doing nothing.</p>
              <p>Supporting the above, Chinese AShBM may level the playing field against the 7th Fleet.</p>
              <p>3) Chinese weapons may prove themselves as exports by then. We may start by buying trucks and Norinco ammo before moving up the tech ladder.</p>
              <p>4) If SEA countries buy Su-34 or comparable bombers, we will need a similar capability.</p>
              <p>5) Our population and leadership wil have significant pro-China leanings by then.</p>

              <p>SG won't get J-20. Whole air force infrastructure need to change. No commonality ie trainers, maintainers, parts. SG can't use China networks nor will give PLA access to SG networks so datalinks won't work.</p>
              <p>Currently, F-15/16s using sniper pods can send video/data to SAF network. G550/E2Cs can communicate safely with the fighters.</p>
              <p>The future F-35 will similarly be able to access internal SAF networks.</p>
              <p>There is a possibility that J-20 avionics can be changed to a common architecture but that will require development (just for Singapore), increasing cost and risk. Same issues faced MY when they did that for their su-30s. Ended up with delays and eventual acceptance of a plane with potentially suspect capabilities.</p>

              <p>It is optimistic but new Chinese weapons will surely have a degree of limited compability with Western systems, for the sake of tradtionally Western-leaning but poorer countries. They supposedly can make compatible targeting pods.</p>
              <p>Whether to our satisfaction is another question, but as a deep penetration bomber and not a fighter or CAS aircraft it won't rely as much on interoperability with other assets. Anyway it's unlikely.</p>

              <p>Unlikely even on a limited compatibility basis.</p>
              <p>US weapons are targeted at China as a potential aggressor. They will not let China have access. Both parties are already engaged in a pseudo cyberwar online so their networks are targeted at defending against each other.</p>
              <p>It will be strange if China relies on US systems eg GPS since service denial will happen if a war starts between the 2. Hence China has developed their own Beidou as an alternative to GPS. So all the GPS guided bombs = out of the window and new munitions need to be procured.</p>
              <p>US will not allow SG to hook up Chinese systems to US ones or allow access to do so. In a 3G network environment where network is king, limited networking will actually be counter-productive even if the J-20 is a fantastic aircraft. Won't happen.</p>
              <p>To be realistic, China is not going to provide their latest a/c which may be used in a conflict with US to be used by a country with such strong military ties to the US either.</p>

              <p>Perhaps in 20 years time the J-20 is no longer hot and it doesn't compare to the F-35 today anyway? I think if China sells the J-20, the US can only stop us until other countries buy it.</p>
              <p>If countries like Thailand, Pakistan, South American and gulf states want to load US systems on Chinese platforms, the US is in no position to stop them. They are offering F-16/18s to India well aware they have Su-30s and an active defence industry that will one day merge the two. As defence costs increase, how else will countries fill their needs without going entirely Chinese/Russian?</p>
              <p>That decreases US leverage even more and weakens the ally. Unless you're Israel, planes are no longer a cheap aid item. Even Taiwan must pay full price. I'm particularly eyeing Thailand. If Burma gets MiG-35s and Vietnam Su-33s, they'll be looking for something affordable yet better than the JAS-39.</p>

              <p>US export certification controls is very tight. US blocked the Phalcon radar to China. US blocked the AESA variant of the Israeli EL/2052 radar for the Indian LCA.</p>
              <p>What US tech, Thailand put onto Chinese frigate would have cleared thru US export licenses. Same as the gulf states+SA. What Pakistan put onto their F-7s would have been European, rather than US avionics.</p>
              <p>Some are able to utilise US tech despite controls eg Iran after the fall of shah but this has not been particularly successful or optimised. Many countries with dual Russki + Western tech all face integration problems.</p>
              <p>Western a/c such as Typhoon or Rafale would also have required US clearance. No issue for Singapore, that's why those were considered. That's why its major that US pulled some export clearance for the gripen for the Indian MMRCA contest. That's also why Su-35 never made it into the top 3 for the SG comp (they won't give detailed access to info).</p>
              <p>Miltech controls are very strict. If SG violates US export controls, one can be sure no further access (at least to the top-end of the tech range) will be granted. Won't happen. J-20 or T-50 won't happen either. Its either F-35 or F-15SE.</p>

              <p>I really feel for those countries unable to afford a full Western solution. No easy way out for them. A downgraded aircraft is not as effective these days.</p>
              <p>It does make you wonder how much Western content is in the upcoming J-15/16. They are years from being ready.</p>
