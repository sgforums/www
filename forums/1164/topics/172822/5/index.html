            <div class='col-md body'>Singapore holds largest-ever surprise attack drill<br>ninemsn.com<br>Sunday Jan 8 13:14 AEDT<br><br>Singapore on Sunday conducted its largest-ever surprise security drill, staging mock bombings and a simulated chemical attack to test readiness for an extremist strike on the city-state.<br><br>Police cars with sirens wailing raced through the dark pre-dawn streets and a blast could be heard from within the Toa Payoh subway station as the exercise got underway.<br><br>The Singapore Civil Defence Force (SCDF) said that along with Toa Payoh, three other central subway stations -- Dhoby Ghaut, Raffles Place and Marina Bay -- were hit by near-simultaneous mock bomb blasts and a simulated chemical attack.<br><br>The city's transit system came under threat of a real attack in 2001, officials have said, and Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong in his New Year's address warned the nation to brace for a possible "terrorist attack" which would threaten economic growth in Southeast Asia's most developed country.<br><br>Officials had kept secret the precise timing of the exercise, codenamed Northstar V.<br><br>SCDF, which operates the city's emergency ambulance and fire services, said the scenario for the drill was similar to the July 7 attacks on London's subway system and a bus, in which 52 commuters and four apparent suicide bombers died.<br><br>"Help! Help! Help!" the would-be victims screamed from inside a still-smoking train at Toa Payoh station after the simulated bombing.<br><br>Officials used mannequins as well as live "victims" stained with fake blood. Some collapsed on the platform while others were wounded inside the train, their "severed" limbs lying nearby.<br><br>SCDF personnel removed the victims on stretchers.<br><br>At the bus interchange outside, rifle-toting police officers guarded the scene after a double-decker bus was hit by a mock bomb that left 42 people "wounded" and fake blood and debris strewn about the roadway as rain fell.<br><br>"We tried to simulate as close as possible," one SCDF official said.<br><br>Emergency services personnel were not pre-positioned ahead of the simulation but responded as if they had received an actual emergency call, he noted.<br><br>"We are playing real-time," the official said.<br><br>Local radio reported that "grieving" relatives had arrived in tears at a victim assistance centre.<br><br>When a fake bomb went off at Dhoby Ghaut station commuters escorted by SCDF personnel had to leave their train through the back door and walk through a tunnel for about 100 metres (yards), local radio reported, quoting a witness.<br><br>A simulated chemical attack later occurred at Dhoby Ghaut, leaving about 40 people collapsed on the platform, radio reported.<br><br>One commuter, Jess Fung, was on her way to work when one of the blasts occurred. She said civil defence officers had boarded her train to advise passengers of the exercise, so she was not afraid.<br><br>"You know it's not the real thing," Fung said.<br><br>The drill lasted for three hours and led to the shutdown of 13 subway stations, including those targeted by the mock attackers, SCDF said.<br><br>"This exercise is part of the ongoing efforts to sharpen the operational readiness of the Homefront agencies in responding to multiple terror attacks," SCDF said in a statement.<br><br>It said 22 agencies were participating in the drill which also served to prepare commuters "in knowing how to react in similar crisis situations."<br><br>But SCDF cautioned that the exercise did not mean Singapore faces the threat of an imminent attack.<br><br>Officials have said that in 2001, extremists planned to attack a bus carrying Americans to Yishun subway station but the attack was foiled when authorities arrested 15 people including members of the Jemaah Islamiyah (JI) network.<br><br>The city-state, a staunch US ally, has stepped up security on fears it will be a target for attack by regional and international extremist groups.<br><br>More than 30 Muslim Singaporeans suspected of JI membership are being held under the Internal Security Act, which allows for detention without trial.<br><br>Authorities have blamed JI for a string of attacks including the 2002 bombings on the Indonesian resort island of Bali, which killed 202 people.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Singapore Runs Terror Drill Similar to London Attack (Update1)<br><br>Jan. 8 (Bloomberg) --<br><br>Singapore conducted mock terrorist attacks on its transport system today, similar to the July bombings on London's subway trains, in the city-state's biggest- ever civil emergency exercise.<br><br>Exercise NorthStar V involved more than 2,000 workers from 22 government departments, while services at 13 subway stations were temporarily disrupted, the Singapore Civil Defence Force said on its Web site. The exercise, which started at 6:25 a.m. local time, lasted about three hours.<br><br>Singapore, home to 4.3 million people, is testing its preparedness after lethal bombs ripped through London's subway last year and Madrid trains in 2004. Since the U.S. attacks on Sept. 11, 2001, Singapore has arrested dozens of suspected terrorists, most tied to a group called Jemaah Islamiyah.<br><br>Today, mock explosive devices were detonated at four subway stations and at a bus interchange in Singapore, the agency said. Three of the subway stations are located within Singapore's central business district. One of the stations had a simulated chemical attack. About 3,000 commuters on board subway trains were evacuated during the drill.<br><br>``Thunderflashes, smoke and fire simulators were used,'' Singapore Civil Defence Force said in the statement on its Web site. ``About 500 simulated casualties with injuries were also deployed to test emergency rescuers at the scene.''<br><br>The date, time and locations were kept secret until 15 minutes before the exercise, to simulate a surprise attack, and police and other emergency services had to respond as if they had received an emergency call.<br><br>`Iconic Target'<br><br>Singapore's former Deputy Prime Minister Tony Tan in July called the city an ``iconic target'' for terrorists. He said the country was ``very high'' on a list of potential targets. The country sits alongside shipping lanes that carry half of the world's oil and a third of global trade.<br><br>The Singapore Civil Defence Force has been responsible for civil emergencies in the country since 1997. The most recent exercise in January 2004 simulated a chemical attack at Raffles Place subway station in the heart of the financial district.<br></div>

All passengers were warned before the 'explosions'.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_confused.gif" alt="Confused" title="Confused"><br><br>The whole purpose of the exercise is not to surprise the public, but to test out our existing resources in dealing with a terrorist attack.<br><br>Anyway most of the 'passengers' in the affected trains were civil defence recruits, as can be seen in the photos... a whole group of fellas in their late teens, botak, wearing the same t-shirt, and all looking equally sian. As for the 'real' members of the public on the affected trains, even if they were deaf to the announcements, they would have known that an 'explosion' will occur soon, judging from the already pre-decorated 'explosion carriage' and the 'casualties' with 'gaping wounds' sitting there waiting for their cue to lie down on the floor.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>The "members of public" who managed to capture the simulated female suicide bomber had several mistakes. They allowed the bomber to be spread-eagled with one of her hands under her, this allows her to trigger the bomb. And also, if you realise, the bomber was wearing a trench coat if nt wrong, if i were a member of the public, I would pin the bomber down by pressing my knee on his/her back and applyin pressure on his/her hands as they are spread-eagled.Also its advisable to roll the fella's sleeves down to prevent him/her hidding a weapon or a secondary detonation device.<br><br>As all good demo experts know...in the real world 2 is 1, 1 is None.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>On what basis is your the theory built upon? If the bomber had 2 wires on one hand (1 finger each), then even separating her hands would be useless as the bomber would have been able to put his fingers together to close the circuit. And are you an eod tech yourself? and besides, i think it was the CID who pinned my dear friend down..</div>
