The government previously wanted to reduce the number of personnel so that modernisation of assets can be implemented," he said.<br><br>The conclusion is, after going through two crises -- the emergency and confrontation -- ATM is undertaking modernisation in line with the country's development and this, according to Zahidi, has nothing to do with the concept of "bargaining power".<br><br>The ATM has never used its strength as a power projector to resolve issues with neighbouring countries, and instead it views diplomacy as a key weapon for maintaining the country's peace.<br><br>-- BERNAMA<br></div>

But what we see here is an extremely emotional response,Â” she said.<br><br>One backbencher said the opposition MPs were merely nitpicking and that it showed they were out of ideas.<br><br><strong>Moving on to another tale, PAS MP Husam Musa told the Dewan that the price of a Russian-made Sukhoi fighter jet was sold 30% cheaper on the Internet compared to the price the Government had agreed to.<br><br>Husam said the Government would be paying RM1bil extra for the 18 Sukhoi Su-30MK fighters.<br><br>Â“The price offered on the Internet for the international market is lower than what we are paying,Â” he said when debating the Bill at committee stage.<br><br>Husam then suggested that perhaps the extra money was in exchange to train the first Malaysian astronaut to be sent to the moon.<br><br>Â“Is this the price to pay to prove the slogan 'Malaysia Boleh'?Â” he said.<br><br>In reply, Deputy Defence Minister Datuk Shafie Apdal said the purchase of the jets was based on a study done by military experts on the suitability and capability of the equipment.<br><br>Â“The price we pay cannot be compared to the price on the Internet. That price did not take into account the detailed specifications and those of additional equipment that we purchase from other suppliers,Â” he said.<br><br>Husam then insisted that Shafie reveal the amount paid for the specifications so that the people would know where the money went.<br><br>Shafie said it was not appropriate for the ministry to reveal details of its military equipment to the public as it involved the countryÂ’s security. </strong><br><br>Prime Minister Datuk Seri Dr Mahathir Mohamad had already tabled Budget 2004 on Friday.<br><br>There should be more interesting tales for weeks to come.

The number of 70,000 (more like 50-55000 according to sources more trustworthy IMO than Bernama, and no its not our own local media) includes real regulars as well as almost 40000 NSFs. The use of the term "full time soldiers" would be more accurate, but then like the PAP, why should Bernama let the truth and accurate terms get in the way of a good story?<br><br>I suppose in your enlightened opinion 15000 real regular soldiers (not in Bernama's context) is enough to defend Singapore?<br><br>And while our defence expenditure does seem high compared to our neighbours, we must also take into account the need to base significant forces overseas and unfortunately that costs money, which is a constraint we must work with due to our size. Hey, I don't like it either, but the way I see it, theres lots of areas where we can save money without cutting back on security.</div>

I'm picking on the fact that you use a small part of the facts and figures to reinforce your point, like the dear government you like to criticise. But then, you're doing the exact same thing. <strong>You take the figure from Bernama and quote it to justify your opinion that too much is being spent on defence, WITHOUT looking at the whole big picture.</strong> Thats my point.<br><br>Of course we need to use statistics to plan and analyse info. But if everyone is like you, using tiny morsels of statistics to justify their arguments (or in you case, flog an old and tired one), then anyone who listens to these analysis are in trouble.<br><br>Which is why I say the PAP is like you in that sense, but thenm thats another topic for another forum.<br><br>All the other statistics are important to me too, but not in the context of this topic and what we're discussing now, which is the <strong>fact that you're selectively using some facts and figures to justify a (arguably flawed) argument, and ignoring all those facts and figures you don't like and doesn't agree with the point you're trying to prove.</strong><br><br>Get it? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"></div>

But what we see here is an extremely emotional response,Â” she said.<br><br>One backbencher said the opposition MPs were merely nitpicking and that it showed they were out of ideas.<br><br><strong>Moving on to another tale, PAS MP Husam Musa told the Dewan that the price of a Russian-made Sukhoi fighter jet was sold 30% cheaper on the Internet compared to the price the Government had agreed to.<br><br>Husam said the Government would be paying RM1bil extra for the 18 Sukhoi Su-30MK fighters.<br><br>Â“The price offered on the Internet for the international market is lower than what we are paying,Â” he said when debating the Bill at committee stage.<br><br>Husam then suggested that perhaps the extra money was in exchange to train the first Malaysian astronaut to be sent to the moon.<br><br>Â“Is this the price to pay to prove the slogan 'Malaysia Boleh'?Â” he said.<br><br>In reply, Deputy Defence Minister Datuk Shafie Apdal said the purchase of the jets was based on a study done by military experts on the suitability and capability of the equipment.<br><br>Â“The price we pay cannot be compared to the price on the Internet. That price did not take into account the detailed specifications and those of additional equipment that we purchase from other suppliers,Â” he said.<br><br>Husam then insisted that Shafie reveal the amount paid for the specifications so that the people would know where the money went.<br><br>Shafie said it was not appropriate for the ministry to reveal details of its military equipment to the public as it involved the countryÂ’s security. </strong><br><br>Prime Minister Datuk Seri Dr Mahathir Mohamad had already tabled Budget 2004 on Friday.<br><br>There should be more interesting tales for weeks to come. Care for another sequel?<br>[/b]</blockquote>LOL!!! SEND A MALAYSIAN COSMONAUT TO THE MOON!? LOL!!!! RUSSIA IS STRUGGLING TO KEEP ITS COMMITMENTS TO THE ISS AFLOAT AND IT WANTS TO SEND MALAYSIANS TO THE MOON? And since when was a sukhoi fighter ever available on the net?

            <div class='col-md body'>In my humble opinion, I think that Singapore cannot be defended, or should I rephrased it as, the actual real estate cannot be defended. To defend Singapore from an invasion, Singapore Armed Forces need to bring the battlefield far far away from its own terrority, thus, the need to project forces some 100 km radius beyond Singapore  itself. Unlike any of the neighbouring country such as Malaysia, Thailand and Indonesia, you can throw a lot of unguided arty rounds across the border, and the  chances of hitting something important is minimal. Throwing anything at Singapore, we immediately suffer major casualties. Even the land of Israel, which is at least 100 times larger than Singapore is considered very small and Israel could have been swallowed up in just 3 days during the 6 days war.<br><br>Thus, Singapore needs to spend proportionally higher to compensate for the lack of strategic depth and the penalty of being the choke point where all major regional or superpower are eyeing after.<br><br>The seeming high number of combat jets are to deter a naval blockade or an air strikes. The large reservist force is to ensure that should SAF deploy troops, it has sufficient troops to occupied enough enemies' terrorities for them to find it difficult to toss stuff across at Singapore.<br><br>I hope this simplistic reasoning will satisfy those who query about Singapore military spending and the rational behind it. In fact, I think the govt has so far been retraining from overspending. They are just spending prudent and yet, in my view, conservative amount.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Dear CX,<br><br><blockquote>how can anyone ever come to an accurate assessment of such figures? </blockquote>Why not? Conventional wisdom shows that an invasion force should be 3x the defenders if it needs any chance of success. If the defenders are in a ready, fortified position, you can hold out maybe even 5x. At this moment, the threat axis from the north has 118k people, so IF they managed to mass all 118k people to within 5km of JB, having a defending force of 40k is considered sufficient to repel the invasion. And we have numerical superority in arty, air and sea.<br><br>By mobilizing 300k defenders, we can hold out even all the combine armies of ASEAN if we stick to our 600sq of land.<br><br><blockquote>anyway, its a known fact that the uniformed services is a big employer and nobody's complaining. </blockquote>Of course no one in the military is complaining. thats the only sacred cow left untouched.<br><br><blockquote>thats not how it works... with terrorism, the lines between the mujahedeen with an AK and a conventional enemy with tanks and missiles have blurred... thats why it requires an all rounded solution, not just police... everybody needs to pool resources and manpower to keep this threat in check. </blockquote>The chances of meeting a mujaheedin with an AK is remote. Finding a small motor boat packed full of plastic explosives blowing up tankers parked off jurong island is more credible. Are we improving our coast guard with our military aquisitions?<br><br><blockquote>i do agree that the danger is always there for the gov't to over-play this hand and use it to justify expensive purchases that do not enhance overall security, but that needs to be put in the correct context.<br><br>if u know of an incident like this, u should probably isolate it for discussion and we'll see if its a valid purchase or just another expensive red herring.<br><br>otherwise, its just not helpful to say "we spend too much money on defence"... the question is "too much money WHERE in defence?". </blockquote>Ok .. lets see .. how about the new submarines and new NGF ? Can we not postpone the aquisition until a latter date, say when our GDP growth rate touches at least 3% consistantly for 4 successive quarters?</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Originally posted by kenhor:<br><strong>Dear Joe Black,<br><br>You are right by saying that Singapore may need 100km buffer zone inorder to spare the infrastructure of Singapore from war damage. But what are we defending?<br><br>Suppose we mobilize every able man and all our regulars and do forward defense .. thats say 300k people .. do you think that Singapore now represents a nice target?<br></strong><br><br>No, because the army would be blocking the land route in, the Air force will be watching the skies and the navy will be patrolling the seas.<br><strong><br>No, its that 10% of the population that is now in harms way that will be the nice target. Singapore is not our buildings .. its our people. We lose our people, we lose Singapore.<br></strong><br><br>We sit tight in Singapore and wait for enemy to conduct a land invasion, or hold a siege on us, we lose people AND infrastructure. Not to mention it lets the enemy choose when exactly he wants to start his invasion from our doorstep,<br><br>We lose our people, we lose Singapore. But if we sit and let the enemy take Singapore, and the people become slaves to the occupier, whats the use of Singaporeans having their lives?<br><strong><br>And secondly, what is the credible threat that we are trying to build an army to face? America plans for 2.5 wars .. that is 2 major conflicts and some peacekeeping mission at once. No more. What is our equation?<br></strong><br><br>Like I asked in the RMAF AEW thread, do you want to wait for a credible threat to emerge before planning a counter-stroke?<br><strong><br>So all I want to ask is, why do people here NOT consider our military force excessive, in light of what is facing us</strong><br><br>Because you or me do not know what will likely be facing us in the medium to long term, and if we wait for a new, bigger threat to emerge before preparing for it, it might be too late.<br><br>Again, this has a point I've already brought up in the RMAF AEW thread.</div>
