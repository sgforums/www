            <div class='col-md body'>Dear Duotiga,<br><br>If you want to see where our economy is headed, just look at australia for example. Its the nearest developed country and a good model of what being a developed economy is like. (not to mention, the best statistics currently for a developing country)<br><br>They are having their best year at this moment. Unemployment is at 6.2%, Growth rates at 3%, birthrate is flat, and they do have lots of commodities to export.<br><br>So in 10-15 years time, Singapore becomes a fully developed nation, that looks like the scenario we are going to have. Are we stable socially and politically at unemployment of 6.2%? How about with the same kind of economic growth rates? We already reached that milestone of flat rate of population increase. However, we are still going to be without resources. Are we ready for that kind of challenges in the economy? Japan progressed very well right up to the 90s but now is in their 10th year of recession.<br><br>So I can say that due to the changing face of our economy, we can't keep certain models constant. Military spending being one of them. And what are the other bad news heading our way?<br><br>The first I can tell you right now is the CPF is in deep shit. Almost every western country's pension fund is in trouble. We will face ours very soon. Those with PR and those commuting from JB are only allowed to withdraw their CPF funds when they reach 55. We had our great influx of them in 1980s. (remember the dean of NUS who got slashed? He was a PR and worked 21 years in Singapore) He had 9 years to go before turning 55.<br><br>So assuming that there are about 100k of them retiring at 55 (out of the 1 million foreigners). So by 2010-2015 timeframe, they will withdraw ALL their money. You work for 20-30 years in Singapore, I can guarantee that they will have at least S$100k in the CPF, if not heaps more. So 100k x 100k = S$10 BILLION will be withdrawn at that time. And as time goes on, more will be withdrawn as many more retire.<br><br>Unfortunately for us, our population is not growing in size, so there is no growth in the number of workers replenishing the CPF. We will have the same problem as the western countries pension funds, and will be made even worse by the fact that these wothdrawers are not going to use their pension money in Singapore, they will take it back to China, India and Malaysia.<br><br>Worse still, last year, the government announced that we can not depend on the CPF being enough for retirement in Singapore. That means EVERYONE who can, will take their money and go to somewhere cheaper. (And I don't even want to think about the property market when these FT sell their HDBs to buy houses)<br><br>I will tell you about the attack on our banking sector right after I come back from Dallas .. got a week there to thanks to bringing some customer for meetings. I love my job ..</div>

Seems like some people left their brains behind in Dallas before they came back to Singapore.<br>A few points to note, kenhor.<br>Without a strong military, we will be in deep shit.An example is Brunei.Now, the Malaysians are claiming billions of dollars worth of oilfield as theirs and infact, they send her navy to drive off oil exploration ships that were working for the Brunei government.As you all know, Brunei is a small country without much  of a militaryIf they had a stronger defense, would such a thing happen? The malaysians would have to think twice before attacking. Without a strong military, your neighbours could now bargain with you for everything.<br><br>Now,with out a strong military, how do you expect any investors to invest in your country, knowing that anytime, somebody is going to threaten you?Even a person who does not know economics understands  such a thing.<br><br>As for cutting back on our military, so what do you propose?Do it like what the newzealanders did? And expect the Australians to defend them? Even with a billateral treaty, You cannot bet that the other party will come to help you when the need arise.<br>And at the same time, by cutting down on the military spendings, you just caused a hell lot of people to lose their jobs in one way or another.<br><br>I suggest that you read up more before you comment on anything. If ever, you get voted to be in the government one day, i think it would be Singapores greatest lost.Probably most people in this forum will think so too.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>That's the problem with people like him who have a problem with the way things are and think that there is a singular simple solution to them which can be implemented easily. Apparently they have only seen the problem and not the complex range of interacting factors underlying them.<br><br>I am not pro-govt., but even I know that many of the things we have a gripe with are not as simple as they seem. Being on the ground and seeing these pratical realities are far more constructive then camping in your ivory tower and proclaiming your lofty, simplistic ideas from there. Apparently of which somebody is doing very well here.<br><br>Frankly I am appaled how somebody can even come up with similar lines of reasoning, esp. on defence plans. Sitting on our island and beating off invaders? We might as well abolish our police, law and order systems and buy stronger iron gates that would be adequate to keep criminals out to save costs.<br><br>Cut our military spending to save the economy? Not by a long shot that's going to work in our case. It's not a solution to our problem, and is at best a stopgap measure.
