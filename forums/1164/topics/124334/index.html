This is to prevent loss of a pistol, which is a great concern by the powers at the top !<br><br>It is issued at my reservist unit. All officers and senior specs. working in certain areas, and who do not need a "full" weapon, but require a personal defence weapon is entitled to draw a pistol from the armskote.<br><br>The problem with having a pistol, as we understand from the "old birds" , are that it is  (1)  very tempting for a criminal to try to steal one ,  and (2) much easier for someone to steal and conceal it !!!!  .... and (3) likely the preferred choice of an armed robber.<br><br>I have seen extreme cases of paranoia in my unit, where my colleagues have drawn pistols and went for outfield exercises. When they sleep at night, they wear their webbing and tie their pistol holster to their webbing with lots of comms cord. It is particularly dangerous in Singapore, when doing training outfield, because some of the training areas are near foreign workers'  construction sites. We are very careful when operating near these workers' sleeping huts.<br><br>For me, I slept with my weapon under my body and ground sheet !!!</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>SAF style... at least in my unit... carrying a pistol , don't look cool. It may draw some looks from others initially, but that is all.<br><br>A few reasons...<br><br>1) The holster issued was leather. The leather in our climate does not work. It started to peel and look quite bad.<br><br>2) The holster is meant to go with another type of belt, or harness or tactical harness.  We used it on our  standard SBO.  People can see that we are not able to draw it fast enough in an emergency and don't look kilat !!!<br><br>3) We were strongly advised to use a lanyard (like the police) to secure it. End up...  a lot of comms cord hanging around your body.

            <div class='col-md body'>I remember firing a SigSauer once. It ought to be a P226 - I can't remember.<br><br>I was covering safety for pistol shoot, and there were some spare rounds. So my Encik gave me an impromptu pistol handling session and let me shoot some rounds.<br><br>Some things I learnt about shooting pistols:<br><br>1. No such thing as one-hand shooting. Sure, you can do that, but the recoil will ensure that the bullet goes anywhere but the target.<br><br>To quote Tom Clancy's Red Rabbit, ' You can fire using one hand only if the other hand is on the f**ker's shoulder'.<br><br>2. Even with two hands, you must grip the pistol firmly. Otherwise, the effects are much the same as No.1. I didn't grip my pistol tightly at first, and my first shot went wild.<br><br>3. Even if you do handle properly with two hands, accuracy is still pretty poor. Definitely worse than a rifle, even at short ranges (50m and less).<br><br>Or maybe it's just me.

I almost hit the deck falling backwards!<br><br>Anyway, here's my 0.2 on some of the points brought up:<br><br>1) One handed shooting A.K.A. Strong Hand or Support Hand - This is done all the time. I ain't talking about being a comboy but Strong H or Support Hand only shooting is almost always part of a basic tactical pistol curriculum. I just have no clue if the SAF includes this.<br><br>Just to give you an idea.....the last tactical pistol match I ran, we had everyone load thier pistol and place it (facing down range) on a stool. When you hear the buzzer, kneel, pick the pistol up with your SUPPORT hand only (that will be left for a rightie) and keep shooting the balloon that is attached to the head of a paper target. When the ballon pops, the target drops and you're done. Some got it done at 7 seconds and some in 30+.<br><br>2) Gripping your pistol too firmly .......ain't gonna get the problem solve. Recoil management starts with your stand and moves up to your grip, followed by front sight, front sight and more front sight. Don't get fooled by looking at the target instead of your front sight.<br><br>3) SIG P226 - I've seen one drop light steel targets at 100 yards. The pistol is only as accurate as the operator up to a certain distance when understading ballistics really, really helps.<br><br>4) Leather holsters - in Singapore? Bad idea. They should have considered kydex.<br><br>5) The SBO is perfect to hold a thigh rig holster but it appears the SAF doesn't think much of thigh rigs. Could still have one attached directly to the belt of the SBO.<br><br>6) Concern about the pistol being snatched could be resolved using a retention holster plus a coiled lanyard (if needed). Most have two retentions and you mostly use the 2nd during down time (koon-ing).<br><br>7) Pistol plus a total of 3 loaded magazines (one in pistol) will not weigh you down. I will be concern about my state of health if it slowed me down.<br><br><blockquote>To issue a pistol to a person without enough training will see the person useless with it as it will not hit the target.</blockquote>Amen, brother.<br><br>Anyway, here's a short vid of someone who rocks with one:<br><br><a href="http://www.ishot-inc.com/temp/Brevit.wmv" rel="nofollow">Strong, Support &amp; Free Style</a></div>
