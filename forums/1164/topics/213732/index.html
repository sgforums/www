And the magnification can only cater to one eye, while the other tries to compensate it mentally... thus stress. Such practice also tends to expose yourself too often to moderately close targets.. because we tends to get too caught up with the target.. forgeting that there are other enemy shooters. Especially when they are moving. The iron sight is crap above the Sar-21 scope .. and the LAD can only do so much a little distance away. Try night shooting with the scope... Our eyes simply cannot coop with it at night...<br><br><blockquote><strong><br>I agree red-dot scope will be better than scope + LAD option.<br><br>But, question: is red dot scope good for long distance target out to 300m?</strong></blockquote>By itself, there would not be much a problem and is performance is satisfactory. It shoots where it is pointed. you can still hit a target 300m away, only not too precise as with a scope (obviously). The thing is with Reflex-scope, there is no magnification and the red-dot tends to block a little of your view from the target (if it's very far away) (Sun-spot effect). Reflex-scope are intended for moderate distance targets.. and by no means with only by a red dot (that are others virtual  sights available) But why compare it with a scope ? Of course, you can have a combination of both.<br><br>What are the chances of hitting any moving targets 300m away. One thing about the SAR-21, because of the lack of recoil, you can actually train your scope on the moving target while shooting.. Something, even the TAR-21 and M-16, M4 and even the Steyr Aug cannot do that well.</div>

I was personally surprised to see the SAR21 being able to be fitted with bayonets too. Spoke to my friend in Armour, he was saying that the SAR21 still can't be fitted with M16 STANMAGs. So perhaps its limited to the export platform, as several US SWAT teams has expressed interest in it. And they probably have more STANMAGs then any other nation in the world, thus we've to adapt to hopefully get their business.<br><br>Anybody can share why doesn't the SAF issue troopers with the P-rail version instead?It makes more sense, as it allows the mounting of a variety of accessories unlike the standard version. Btw, to existing users of SAR21, with the old M16, you can tape 2 magazines together to help in quick reloading, but what about the SAR21? Thanks in advance!</div>

The magnification is really too small to cause that kinda problems.  That may happen when u're looking through a 4x sniper scope though.<br><br>1.5x scope is comfortable enuff for the shooter to open both of his eyes, to shoot.  Allows greater situational awareness and accuracy as well.<br><br>I agree that the current SAR-21 is not a good product for the SAF.  A better system would have been the Sar-21 carbine in the first place.  No, useless LAD, just a good reflex sight.</div>

They are not snipers, just infantrymen.<br><br>How they designate 'sharpshooters' is again haphazard. I get marksman grade everytime at the range - better than all the 'sharpshooters' in my platoon, but I am not a designated 'sharpshooter'. Some of the designated sharpshooters were downright bad shooters.</div>

Thanks in advance!</div></blockquote>Taping 2 magazines together may be OK for urban fighting. For the jungle or any soil or sandy area, it is a very bad idea as the rounds in the other mag that's taped upside down would get dirty when you prone etc, causing stoppages later.<br><br>It also makes the weapon uncomfortably heavy. I can only imagine people (especically guerillas) do it cos they saw it in the movies and think it is cool. Or tey don't have ammo webbing to carry spare mags.<br><br>The other option is to have proper magazine clips which would hold both (or even three) of the mags in upright position.</div>
