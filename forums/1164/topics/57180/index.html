            <div class='col-md body'>The SAF Signals Corps had its beginnings in the days of the Singapore Military Forces and was absorbed into the Malaysian Armed Forces during the merger between Singapore &amp; Malaysia in 1963. But with independence came the first true SAF Signals Corps on 1 Mar 1966, consisting of 2 Officers and 54 men as part of the Armed Forces of the Republic of Singapore. In Jun 1966, the Communications and Electronics Department was set up while the first signals unit, MID Signal Battalion, was formed on 6 Feb 1967.<br><br>The first immediate need for institutional signal training was met with the establishment of School of Signals in Jul 1967 as part of SAFTI. The Communications and Electronics Department was enlarged to a Formation HQ in Aug 1970 to cope with the increasing demand for the provision of essential communications in the SAF. 3rd Signal Battalion, providing communications for 3rd Singapore Division, was established in the early 70's. In 1977, the first reserve signals battalion, 6th Signal Battalion was raised, followed by 9th Signal Battalion the next year. The Reserve Signals Training Centre was formed to take on the role of training the NS signal battalions in the SAF. In Feb 1988, the vision of a permanent home for the Signal Formation was realised when HQ Signals shifted from Tanglin to Stagmont Camp. Over the years, the SAF Signals have made great advancements and bold strides. From a small unit operating obsolete HF and part civilian equipment, it has grown into a professional corps with area-wide trunk and data communications system.<br>[/quote]<br>taken from the army website</div>

Like combat engineers, there are many sub-vocations. If you are a signaller in an infantry or armoured unit, you will operate VHF radio eqmt (either backpack or mounted on landrover) and lay lotsa d-10 lines.<br><br>At a brigade level and upwards, a signaller's job is usually different. He will be trained to operate more sophisticated stuff like those expensive trunk comms stuff mounted on unimog or he can be trained to set up the communications eg. telephones, fax machines, pabx, encoders...etc at the ops center where all the crabs and stars congregate during operations. Not so much line-laying but do watch out for the 26-pair cables.<br><br>One of the most 'on' signal unit is 3rd signal, which is attached to the division. You get to do stuff like SOC and unarmed combat   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_twisted.gif" alt="Twisted Evil" title="Twisted Evil">  Some signal units are switched off like 1st Sig are manned mostly by regulars and couple of white-horse.<br><br>Hope this helps</div>

You can be a rifleman signaller in infantry company and you do the same thing as everyone, clearing soc, unarmed combat ... and during mission, you walk with your PC or OC, carrying the phone for them.<br><br>I bet signallers with their long long antenna on their back are juicy targets for snipers.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br><br></div></blockquote>They should put a flag on the antenna saying....
