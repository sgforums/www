I just think that the way it wrote in the paper make you wonder so misleading.<br><br>what was interesting picture that I saw in CNA.com was that the medic that was shown in the picture was still wearing the SAF number 4. it make u wonder even more if SAF was involved.  when I was station in starlight we have to wear the ROC green so sometime visiting troops may still wear #4.<br><br></div>
