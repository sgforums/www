The Chen Shui Bian government even took down Sun and Jiang's painting and statue from the government office.<br>Sad to say, from what I can see based on singapore government's action in the past, they don't really like to see Taiwan &amp; China to be united together.<br>So, better do the training at countries like australia, new zealand all this.</div></blockquote>i sneak this dialog on the china bashing forum but i think SG gov is looking at china with consideration. So at this "moment" looking at preserving the status quo of 1 country 2 systems create stabilities in the region.<br><br><strong>SPIEGEL: What are your reservations?<br><br>Mr. Lee: I don't know whether the next generation will stay on this course. After 15 or 20 years they may feel their muscles are very powerful. We know the mind of the leaders but the mood of the people on the ground is another matter. Because there's no more communist ideology to hold the people together, the ground is now galvanised by Chinese patriotism and nationalism. Look at the anti-Japanese demonstrations. </strong><br><br></div>
