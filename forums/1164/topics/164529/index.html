            <div class='col-md body'>This is a really expensive war as far as I can see, a long-drawn war.<br>There were of course shocking incidents written in the book, let's see........ah, the USS Forrestal fire, a F-4B rocket ignited while still on deck hitting a fully loaded, ordance and fuel, A-4 which promptly set offan almighty chain reaction. By the time the smoke cleared the next day, scene of devastation. 134 people were killed, 21 airplanes destroyed, 34 damaged. Incredibly, the A-4 pilot survived. The ship set sailed home after spending only 4 days in SEA.<br><br>There were also a lot of collisions, and there was also 1 involving 2 B-52s, the debris that littered the area must be wow! On the navy side, a lot of tragic accidents involing catapult and arresting gear, the poor pilots who kena these almost always never survive. Most shot down cases involve AAA fire, and there also a significant number of poor souls who flew into ground, strike trees, etc. And thanks to the humid weather and pounding to the air-frame bcos the planes always land hard for fear of AAA, some aircrafts literally wear out, like the spectacular cases of wings seperating in case of T-28 and A-26 while diving (sure die!). There were even more cases of bombs exploding prematurely, rocket debris that got ingested so on.<br><br>The F-4 and the F-105D best epitomise the Viet War, these 2 alone account for almost half of USAF losses. The F-105 is a sturdy aircraft which can take multiple, hence was a popular choice in the war, but there was little system redundence, and the pilot almost always have to eject if the vitals get hit. The F-4 was used from FAC to MiGCAP, to straffing and bombing roles. Was the true multi-role aircraft in the war. Hence, so many were downed. An estimated about half of F-105s produced were downed.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by SingaporeMacross:</div><div class="quote_body">yeah, i wondered what happened..</div></blockquote>Accidents. 1 lost in 1970, another in 1972. The SR-71s operated from Okinawa, and flew strategic recons missions over N Viet. The 1 in 1972 tried to land in airstrip in bad weather, pilot aborted landing after releasing drag-chute, so the next landing was done on slick ground and without drag chute. Not surprsingly, given the mass of the SR-71, the plane overshot and hit the runway barrier. The plane was then cannibalised for spare parts.<br><br>Regarding F-105s, the F-105s manage to shoot down a number of MiGs and were themselves shot down every now and then. Think the F-8s shot down the most MiGs? Followed by F-4s, then F-105s?<br><br>The F-105 was designed by Republic to be a front-line deep nuclear strike aircraft, hence its suitability for low-level missions, but survivability was not a priority, hence the high losses. The F-105s were used in Wild Weasel missions, FAC, bombing, straffing and so on.<br><br>It was combat debut for a number of aircrafts, notably the F-111 and the F-5. The F-111 was on trial under project Combat Lancer, but fared extremely badly. Engines and avionics were constantly out of order, and the crew and ground crew were not experienced and from what I can see, almost every mission had at least 1 F-111 aborting. The sqn was withdrawn in 1968 and returned only in 1972, where the F-111 only then proved the low-level strike aircraft of the pilots' dream.</div>

Actually, I think SAR choppers suffered more, esp with the smart N Viet waiting next to the downed crew, until the chopper arrives and pow! In many cases I have seen, there were quite a lot of Americans on the ground every time someone gets shot down.</div>
