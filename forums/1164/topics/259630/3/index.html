Imagine one whole platoon of tanks sitting there in the middle of the night setting up snorkel which take 15mins to setup .... setting pasar malam is it ?  the river bed may be mud, may get badly struck .<br><br>That why usually well developed armour formation have their bridging engineer element, the armour would have recce on the route they taking, they would have put out infantry to secure the bridging site and send in the engineer to bridge the gap using bridge or floating bridge .... the timing is work out down to exact .... the tanks will just reach it when the bridge is complete and they cross immediately . The laying down of the bridge is faster then setting up snorkel.<br><br>The tanks in real war time will move on their own.  The reason like Specialops say is it is hard to drive a tanks down a road with all vehicles around for safetly reason. Next is to protect the road, the track will damage the road.</div>
