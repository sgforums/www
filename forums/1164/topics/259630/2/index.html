AFAIK or i suspect however, the limit for these civi vehicles is about 30+ a little bit tons. That's the reason why you can see 2 M113(13) or just 1 sm1(1<img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool">, bx(26) or primus(29) on a civi trailer when on the road.  The weight is limited.<br><br>Regarding the L2, the Combat weight of the L2A4 is actually 55 tons and not (A6) 62 tons as mentioned. Can some of our roads take that weght?  Yes.<br><br>Do we have the vehicles to move these MBTs? Yes<br><br>Are we reinforcing our roads and bridges so that more can take this weight of up to 60+ tons?  YES.  Take a look around some of the older bridges.  Most now have spanking new grey/white painted concrete rebars reinforcing/supporting the old bridges now.<br><br>I think that we are buying some tanks as test/trail equipment to tear apart to study as well.  After all, these MBTs only have a modern shelf life of about 10 years.  I wont be surprised that by then we can build a localised MBT that's more customised based on the L2 blueprint.<br><br>So dont keep thinking those 30 arent really spares.</div>
