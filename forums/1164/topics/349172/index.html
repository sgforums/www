              <h1>Dynamit Nobel Defence Pzf 90 Matador LAW system (Germany), Anti-tank weapons</h1>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>''Development </strong><br> In 1999, Dynamit Nobel Defence developed - <span style="color: #ff0000;">under contract
              from the Defence Science and Technology Agency (DSTA) of Singapore</span> - a
              new short-range Light Anti-armour Weapon (LAW) to meet the needs of the
              modern battlefield, especially that in an increased urban environment.
              There were numerous human-factors trials conducted with the aim of
              optimising the ergonomic features of the weapon. As a result, the
              weapon is also considered to be a '<span style="color: #ff0000;">soldier-centric' weapo</span>n. The weapon
              incorporates a new warhead technology that enables the gunner to switch
              from High-Explosive Anti-Tank (HEAT) mode to High-Explosive Squash-Head
              (HESH) mode, in which the impact fuze has a delay function. With an
              enhanced performance of the warhead of more than 500 mm in Rolled
              Homogenous Armour (RHA), the Pzf 90 Matador can, it is claimed, defeat
              all known Armoured Fighting Vehicles (AFVs) and light tanks. When used
              in the HESH mode, <span style="color: #ff0000;">the warhead creates a hole of 450 mm diameter in a
              double brick wall - an important feature when fighting in built-up
              areas</span>. The projectile is fired at a high velocity and is insensitive to
              crosswinds, owing to the special in-flight propulsion system. The Pzf
              90 is used by Dynamit Nobel Defence as the baseline weapon for its new
              developments in the US and the UK. New warheads are in development for
              wall-breaching, bunker-destruction, kinetic-energy-penetrator and
              tandem-warhead versions.</p>
              <p><strong>Description </strong><br> The Pfz 90 is a shoulder-launched one-shot weapon with a
              multipurpose warhead. The weapon is based on the Davis-gun countermass
              principle, with the countermass comprising ceramic powder. The adoption
              of this principle permits the firing of the weapon in enclosed
              (confined) spaces with single-ear protection only. The launch tube is
              made of wrapped Aramide fibre. The launcher is issued as a complete
              round of ammunition, with the only preparation required before use
              being to unfold the handgrips and the shoulder rest. Aiming is
              performed using an optical sight with ×1.5 magnification. A standard
              interface railing can be used for adding a night sight such as the
              Zeiss NSA 80 for night operations. The trigger operates on the
              percussion principle; an explosive cord is routed through the
              countermass and is then connected to the propellant charge. The Pzf 90
              can be fired from confined spaces of less than 18 m2 with doors closed.
              The projectile is launched with a flat trajectory, with a time of
              flight of 1.2 seconds to 300 m. The minimum range is 20 m, and the
              maximum range is 500 m. A subcalibre training device with 18 mm
              ammunition and other training aids are available. In keeping with
              current practices, the manufacturer offers a full training and support
              package.''EOQ</p>

              <p> good point.</p>
              <p>you basically fabricated accusations and chucked them at me. but in all good humour, ild reply you in kind.</p>
              <p>have i</p>

              <p> </p>
              <p>i didnt even touch on a), why so jumpy ? scared i pwn you arh ?</p>
              <p>i dont tease, i think thats too delicate for me to handle. i prefer the sledgehammer blow of realism and logic. SAF is strong, but its simulteneously weak for a same reason.</p>
              <p>plus, for that matter, strong / strength is a relative concept. i.e if i have, and you dont have, means im stronger and you are weaker. till the day singapore acquires something like 11 carriers, 333 ship navy, 10 divisions of regular GI army and 4093 manned aircraft and still have another 200,000 marines on active duty.</p>
              <p>i wont call the SAF strong until the day SAF surpass this. do you think SAF is strong ? substantiate.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>and to begin with, i m not even teasing. what makes you think im teasing ? prove it. i dont like</p>
              <p>dont use the word US. there is no US. there is you. i am referring to you and directly asking you a question. there are no others. we can treat this as a private conversation for all its worth. i am addressing you and only you. answer me what is this</p>

But I agree that this is not as important as having excellent people to man these weapons. Many successful battle tested armies attest to  this fact - they do not necessarily need the best weapons to overcome their enemies in  battle.  In the contrary, their defeated enemies may possess the more advanced weapons in larger quanities. </p></div>
