              <div class="quote_body">
              <p>Malaysia would never have risked war over the water dispute.  From what I understand, the Malaysian government guards the "taps" to Singapore and ensures anyone who wants to turn off the taps are far far away.  If they didn't guard those properly, they were gonna have trouble guarding something else...</p>
              <p>As for Singapore bashing, its probably not the end of it though I suspect there will be some back-channel communication with Singapore's leaders on a personal level.  That way, the SG government won't be too stunned to reply inappropriately.  That has happened before from what I understand.</p>
              <p>As for a Malaysian political crises, the best they've ever done was, "Look at how our poor Singaporean Malays are suffering across the causeway?" Then some Singaporean Malay MP will just come up and politely ask them wtf they are talking about.  To infiltrate Singapore and stir up ethnic unrest would be a little tough... more on the "how" rather than the why.  </p>
              <p>IMO, how Pedra Branca could have turned ugly.if not for both country's willingness to submit their contention to ICJ.</p>
              <p>A possible scenario:  Malaysian activists heads towards the Horsburgh Lighthouse in boats with the Malaysian Coast Guard in trail to "maintain order."  The activists in a number of boats decide to land on Pedra Branca to plant the Malaysian flag to assert the claims on behalf of their country.  SAF troops guarding the lighthouse turns out, some with Batons and Shields while others loaded their rifles.  Loudspeakers blare to asking them to turn away or else... unheeded.</p>
              <p>The activists land on the piers and some beach on the rocks.  Most rush out with video cameras while one plants the Malaysian flag on the rocks.  The soldiers respond by heading down to the rocks to turn the activists away but are outnumbered.  A scuffle breaks out as the activists surrounds the soldiers.  The soldiers retaliate with their batons as they try to push them back.  The soldiers standing higher up are nervous, the sharpshooter carefully scans each an everyone of the activist from his vantage point.</p>
              <p>More soldiers rush to the rocks and the piers with batons.  Suddenly, two of the activists pull out concealed pistols and shoots the baton-armed soldiers and continue wildly shooting, injuring soldiers and activists alike.  The sharpshooter spots the first shooter and shoots but hits another man instead.  He shoots again quickly and takes down one of the shooters.  The rest of the activists scatters, but with little place to run, get caught in the crossfire.  Another man was shot before the last shooter was taken down. The nervous soldiers sees men rushing towards them, and in fear of getting shot and despite warnings to stop, they fire warning shots... </p>
              <p>The Malaysian Coast Guard vessels seeing the shots fired, quickly report the incident back to their head quarters while the commander of the lighthouse security contingent does the same.  Soon, both RMN and RSN gunboats arrive on the scene...</p>
              <p>At the same time, both Prime Ministers Yee and Abdul get an urgent phone call from their defense ministers...</p>
              <p>Both Navies stand off at Pedra Branca.  The soldiers quickly detain the rest of the activists while some of them fled back on the boats they came on.  The RSN gunboat attempts to pursue and despite the warnings, they make it across the contested invisible line in the water.  Those who fled were detained by the RMN and Coast Guard instead.</p>
              <p>Meanwhile, both governments swing into action.  The Malaysian Government demand the extradition of both detained activists and SAF soldiers involved in the shooting for trials in Malaysia on the basis of their sovereignty claims over the Batu Puteh.  The Singaporean government refuses and will investigate the incident as Pedra Branca is under Singapore's sovereign territory.</p>
              <p>Video footage that fled the lighthouse soon circulate on youtube and the various news channels.  Protests occur in Johor where Singaporeans heading back across the causeway are harassed, attacked or detained.  Most of the Singaporeans remain boh chup, while some are a little kiasu actually start stocking up water, rice and canned food.  Reservists are called up as green men start flashing on the TVs and cinemas while stickers were pasted on doors.</p>
              <p>Back in Johor, Malaysian infantry were called in to action to assist the police in maintaining order as more protesters are mobilized via the internet.  The SAF views the involvement of the Malaysian Army warily..................... *you can continue the rest*</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Fortunately for us who live in reality, the ICJ saw to it that this scenario would not happen as both countries have given their word to abide by the rulings of the court.</p>
              <p>As long as nobody does anything stupid, Singapore and Malaysia should continue to enjoy warm bilateral relations. =D</p>

              <p><br>i am currently playing this "Long"  sleepy computer game where I am trying to built up SG SAF. This Game SG has pre-selection of Bionix IFV and FH2000 155 Howitzer. and Bionix Engineer. Fearless class vessel interesting hur.....!</p>
              <p>I just need enough capital to trade with Germany for Leo 2A and with N. America for F-16 and F-15J &amp; K and MLRS.  Frigate from France.</p>
              <p>And start conscript Singaporean than I am sort of closed to creating a simplified SAF figthing capabilities....</p>
              <p>The problem is that the game only provide SG with only 3 Grid. with allocated Navy Dock. military Barrack, and Land fabrication for armour production...with 1 opening slot for construction. So i built an airfield intended for F-16. For defensive purposes.</p>
              <p>i would like to establish 5 power defence agreement, But I think the game does not allow to preset agreement with 5 nations so i need to built bilateral agreements with the individual 5 nations seperately to represent 5 power defence agreement.  </p>
              <p>Still building on it....like i said its a slow and sleepy process.  Took me 4 months to annex Kashimer and half of Pakistan.</p>

              <p><strong>The naming of SAF operations</strong></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Garamond; line-height: normal; font-size: medium;">The operations undertaken by the SAF have names that stem from its historical links to the British and Israeli militaries, where descriptive codenames are used to provide a reader with some idea of the activities and objectives being undertaken.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; line-height: normal; font-size: medium;">
              </span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0in; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; widows: 2; orphans: 2;"><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-style: normal;"><span style="font-weight: normal;">This could be seen in the SAF's operational planning soon after Singapore's independence. The main effort then had been on </span></span></span><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-style: normal;"><span style="font-weight: normal;">making a would-be invader believe that an attack on Singapore would be fully resisted. The plan had jokingly been dubbed Operation Poison Shrimp by a young Army officer during a planning session with the SAF's Israeli military advisers, and had officially been adopted by SAF headquarters subsequently.</span></span></span></p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0in; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; widows: 2; orphans: 2;"> </p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0in; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; widows: 2; orphans: 2;"><span style="color: #000000;">In the late 1980s, this defensive plan was finally shelved in favour of a new approach that better reflected the increasing confidence and capacity of the Singapore military to conduct offensive operations. This eventually led to the current plan for an attack on southern Johor to secure Singapore's water supply.Codenamed Operation 30 Leagues (representing the approximately 130km distance between SAF headquarters at Bukit Gombak and the furtherest point of advance - the East Coast town of Mersing), this plan had changed little since its original formulation despite now being in its fourth iteration.</span></p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0in; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; widows: 2; orphans: 2;"> </p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0in; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; widows: 2; orphans: 2;"><span style="color: #000000;">One cosmetic change that did take place was the renaming of the Operation for public consumption. Reflecting the increased awareness of the importance of international public support for its actions, Singapore policy makers decided to take a leaf from the US military, which since the late 1980s had taken to choosing operation codenames which played a part in the US' public diplomacy efforts surrounding its military actions, such as Operations Just Cause (Panama) and Restore Hope (Somalia). Likewise, Singapore policy makers cast around for an operation codename that emphasised the legal standing of Singapore's position and the necessity of securing water for the island nation's survival. They decided on Operation Righteous Need.</span></p>

              <p>I don't know about using H2O....I don't mean to shoot this one down....but i think the geo political tension after the annoucement of new water and using singapore river delta as water catchment area sort of diminished the geo political tension of water with MY. And not to mention that Singapore govt is not going to renew 1 of the agreement when it expired.</p>
              <p>Maybe some country used conventional sizsure of the oil refinering in the south land or something that spark some kind of military intervention. After all real conflict circle around Energy.</p>

              <p>Hey Araphoe, thanks for your comments so far, and you're absolutely right, I don't think that the water issue is now a real casus belli for the SAF. What I'm actually thinking of doing is backdating this invasion story to a time when it was an issue - soon after 1997, when I think water was still central in policy makers' minds. </p>
              <p>That means no cool new systems (sorry all), but then at least the forces will be more even, especially when it comes to the chapters on guerilla warfare and internal dissent. </p>
              <p>and at least then there will be less concern that i accidentally write something that is too sensitive for publication. </p>

            <div class='col-md body'><p>Just to get all your opinions on something: How do you think the Malaysians would react to an occupying Singapore force? I mean, do you think they would split along racial lines (as they appeared to largely do during the Japanese occupation and to a very much lesser extent during the communist emergency) or would nationalism play a strong role? Any anecdotes or insights you have would be great to hear. </p></div>

              <p>Just a thought from entertaining....purposes...and not political.</p>
              <p>.....arm conflict between My n SG is already a sensitive topics .....the risk of taking a notch down might just be counter productive to generate serious readers' interest.</p>
              <p>Remember the movie The Day After......during the height of cold war the scenario  was so real that it freaks the american audience.  Contrast to the book Red Storm Rising it provide the intensity but not real but an escape.....entertaining. Both exploded the scope and the tone set the mood and both plot took different turns.</p>
