              <p>So, I was thinking of writing a book on a conflict between Singapore and Malaysia. Completely fictional but felt it would be an interesting topic. Think the only similar thing has been "The Missing Page", "Crisis in the Straits" and "Ransom" by Douglas Chua. </p>
              <p>Just wanted to know what everyone thought, and would like to read.. this constitutes part of my market research :) ..</p>
              <p>would you prefer for eg: </p>
              <p>1. An invasion of Singapore by Malaysia </p>
              <p>2. An invasion of Malaysia by Singapore</p>
              <p>Not planning on doing any country / military bashing, everything is to be done in an objective and logical manner, with open source material only. Maybe in the form of a fictional future. Such as in the "Third World War" by Sir John Hackett.</p>
              <p>Any and all comments would be welcome. <br>Thanks!</p>

              <p>US / ISRAEL attacked IRAN and SYRIA....................Zionist-owned S'pore supports US operations with logistics, etc...............</p>
              <p>M'sia cuts off water and food exports to S'pore............and finally the SAF fulfills it's sole purpose............invades Johore for water and food....................of course with US support, politically and militarily..........</p>
              <p>while the 2nd Link at Tuas was bombed by the M'sians..............the reason why the Causeway was never done away with became clear as S'pore poured across it into M'sia..................</p>
              <p>the reason why S'pore bought all those 2nd hand Leopard tanks was soon apparent...............</p>
              <p>Indonesia tried to interfere but their politicians were bought off with bribes so they stayed out of the conflict................</p>
              <p>the M'sians, caught by surprise were quickly overwhelmed by the SAF.............thanks to it's vast numerical superiority in battle tanks, attack choppers and fighters.................</p>
              <p>M'sia then played the Islam card, appealing to Malays in S'pore and the SAF for support..............as well as the huge numbers of M'sian workers and PRs.</p>

              <p>haha AsRom - those are really good ideas! Some very close to the lines i was thinking of as well. I ask about the invasion of SG thing cos my wife was saying that that was something she would be interested in reading about. But i was telling her that most red-blooded SG males would want to read about the SAF doing the thing they've been planning/training/talking about for so long. </p>
              <p>many thanks! You'll get a credit if this thing really sees the light of day. </p>

              <p>i got a short and crazy idea...</p>
              <p>PRC being a true superpower  and economic global house like the USA.</p>
              <p>In order to have a larger territory to support it's already huge population and counting.She decided to conquer whole of SEA.</p>
              <p>Singapore sees it as a opportunity to conquer whole of malaysia, penisula an east. SG proceeded to conquer johor and further north , RSN and it's aircraft carrier spearhead the assult on east malaysia ,alongside SAF and Bruenian forces attacking from Brunei, conquering sabah and sararwak swiftly. In recognition of Brunei's help and support due to country being constantly builled by malaysia and it's territory spilt into half. SG award the malaysian territory stand in between both parts of brunei to make it a contigious brunei, as well as some part of sarawak and sabah.</p>
              <p>meanwhile in the north of penisula side, PRC troops have reach the malaysian border from thailand. SAF without hestination ailled itself with the PRC, and SAF proposed to have the alliance attack indonesia which has quite a significant number of troops to counter both PRC and SAF each.</p>
              <p>Indonesia not to be outdone quickly attack the conquer malaysian borneo area from their part of borneo, as PRC forces are mainly on the indochinese mainland their forces can't reach there fast enough, so SAF gotta enlist the help of US forces in pacific to help out, and not only they stopped the invasion but they also conquered indonesian borneo, a strategical victory, as all of indonesia is within RSAF's range.</p>
              <p>Soon after SAF-PLAN alliance have defeated indonesia, but immediately PRC revocated the alliance and tried to seize malaysia from SAF, but once again SAF can count on the help of US forces to drive the PLA out of malaysia.</p>
              <p>Finally with entire malaysia and indonesia secured,PAP's reach has extended far beyond SG. PAP then proceeded on to implement  ERP,GST,COE,NS and whatever what not. Finally, some SG minister can say "you die ya business", "get out of my uncaring elite face","lesser mortals" and so on to 200 million plus of it's conquered citiznery.</p>

              <p>Thanks everyone for their comments. Yup working on a realistic scenario for how a conflict would start is important. Cos if not.. all the war porn that comes later will just be a little fake. </p>
              <p>Probably maybe like Malaysia has internal problems and then tries to use Singapore as a scapegoat. But then people on the ground get carried away and then try to cut the water supply - always the main casus belli for the SAF right? </p>
              <p>So then mixed signals in SG mean that our leaders think that the move is for real, and then activate their operational plans. (at first as deterrence). The only problem is that the Malaysian leaders also cannot say that they're not in charge of their own country, so they don't deny the threat to our water.. </p>
              <p>one thing leads to another.. etc etc </p>

              <p>Malaysia is facing a political crisis. The Malays bumis are not getting their share of the wealth, as all the ultras are getting sweep the wealth up. The neglected and robbed East Malaysia is in turmoil as they want to break away from the federation. The Malaysian economy is at its worse. Racial tension is high, and may flare up anytime.</p>
              <p>A diversion is needed. And as always there is Singapore.</p>
              <p>Malaysian agent provocatuers infiltrate into Singapore, stir up unrest among the Malays, instigate an incident, and Abang comes across the causeway to help their suffering bretherns in Singapore.</p>
              <p>SAF ever vigilent swung into action, activated mobilisation, and the MFA got into eye ball to eye ball confrontation with the Malaysian counter parts. A few macho rounds were fired by the military, but the situation is under control.</p>
              <p>And with international mediation, Malaysia was "allowed" to back away, as they have no intention to invade anyway.</p>

              <p>Malaysia would never have risked war over the water dispute.  From what I understand, the Malaysian government guards the "taps" to Singapore and ensures anyone who wants to turn off the taps are far far away.  If they didn't guard those properly, they were gonna have trouble guarding something else...</p>
              <p>As for Singapore bashing, its probably not the end of it though I suspect there will be some back-channel communication with Singapore's leaders on a personal level.  That way, the SG government won't be too stunned to reply inappropriately.  That has happened before from what I understand.</p>
              <p>As for a Malaysian political crises, the best they've ever done was, "Look at how our poor Singaporean Malays are suffering across the causeway?" Then some Singaporean Malay MP will just come up and politely ask them wtf they are talking about.  To infiltrate Singapore and stir up ethnic unrest would be a little tough... more on the "how" rather than the why.  </p>
              <p>IMO, how Pedra Branca could have turned ugly.if not for both country's willingness to submit their contention to ICJ.</p>
              <p>A possible scenario:  Malaysian activists heads towards the Horsburgh Lighthouse in boats with the Malaysian Coast Guard in trail to "maintain order."  The activists in a number of boats decide to land on Pedra Branca to plant the Malaysian flag to assert the claims on behalf of their country.  SAF troops guarding the lighthouse turns out, some with Batons and Shields while others loaded their rifles.  Loudspeakers blare to asking them to turn away or else... unheeded.</p>
              <p>The activists land on the piers and some beach on the rocks.  Most rush out with video cameras while one plants the Malaysian flag on the rocks.  The soldiers respond by heading down to the rocks to turn the activists away but are outnumbered.  A scuffle breaks out as the activists surrounds the soldiers.  The soldiers retaliate with their batons as they try to push them back.  The soldiers standing higher up are nervous, the sharpshooter carefully scans each an everyone of the activist from his vantage point.</p>
              <p>More soldiers rush to the rocks and the piers with batons.  Suddenly, two of the activists pull out concealed pistols and shoots the baton-armed soldiers and continue wildly shooting, injuring soldiers and activists alike.  The sharpshooter spots the first shooter and shoots but hits another man instead.  He shoots again quickly and takes down one of the shooters.  The rest of the activists scatters, but with little place to run, get caught in the crossfire.  Another man was shot before the last shooter was taken down. The nervous soldiers sees men rushing towards them, and in fear of getting shot and despite warnings to stop, they fire warning shots... </p>
              <p>The Malaysian Coast Guard vessels seeing the shots fired, quickly report the incident back to their head quarters while the commander of the lighthouse security contingent does the same.  Soon, both RMN and RSN gunboats arrive on the scene...</p>
              <p>At the same time, both Prime Ministers Yee and Abdul get an urgent phone call from their defense ministers...</p>
              <p>Both Navies stand off at Pedra Branca.  The soldiers quickly detain the rest of the activists while some of them fled back on the boats they came on.  The RSN gunboat attempts to pursue and despite the warnings, they make it across the contested invisible line in the water.  Those who fled were detained by the RMN and Coast Guard instead.</p>
              <p>Meanwhile, both governments swing into action.  The Malaysian Government demand the extradition of both detained activists and SAF soldiers involved in the shooting for trials in Malaysia on the basis of their sovereignty claims over the Batu Puteh.  The Singaporean government refuses and will investigate the incident as Pedra Branca is under Singapore's sovereign territory.</p>
              <p>Video footage that fled the lighthouse soon circulate on youtube and the various news channels.  Protests occur in Johor where Singaporeans heading back across the causeway are harassed, attacked or detained.  Most of the Singaporeans remain boh chup, while some are a little kiasu actually start stocking up water, rice and canned food.  Reservists are called up as green men start flashing on the TVs and cinemas while stickers were pasted on doors.</p>
              <p>Back in Johor, Malaysian infantry were called in to action to assist the police in maintaining order as more protesters are mobilized via the internet.  The SAF views the involvement of the Malaysian Army warily..................... *you can continue the rest*</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Fortunately for us who live in reality, the ICJ saw to it that this scenario would not happen as both countries have given their word to abide by the rulings of the court.</p>
              <p>As long as nobody does anything stupid, Singapore and Malaysia should continue to enjoy warm bilateral relations. =D</p>
