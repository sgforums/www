Thankyou.<br><br>In my knowledge of PDW, it for a start have to be light, compact. The main objective of a PDW is for certain troops working in confined environment who need a weapon that can provide a higher volume of fire, further range and more penetration power than an automatic pistol and if possible, more compact than a submachine gun. A good example of a PDW is the P-90 which is used by snipers (as a secondary weapon), tankees and pilots in foreign service.<br><br>The SSW (squad support weapon) under my knowledge is not a personal defence weapon as it is too large, bulky and heavy to be one. It is a support weapon belonging to the class of the old M-16/M-203 combi and the OCIW. Perhaps the SSW can fire the special 5.7mm round that the P90 PDW can fire but the SSW is still a SSW not a PDW.<br><br>For more visual reference of a PDW, please refer to the MP5K-PDW and the G-11 PDW.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I think what it mean is that the SSW consist of a PDW as well as a grenade launcher, something like the OICW which consist of component sections. However if the ST staff will to tell mi that the SSW as a whole is a PDW, i will certainly not give credit to that. It is as good as saying the SAR-21 is a submachine gun and the Ultimax is a assualt rifle.<br><br>My two cents. Thanks for the link.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>The FN P-90 is also used by SAF Special Forces or Commandos.<br><br>I have seen many pictures of these people with the FN P-90 with scope mount and silencer.<br><br>I don't know how they are organised but there were 2 guys out of about 20 whom were armed like this. So I suspect they must be doing what US would call "Hush Puppy" work. Basically their job is to silence the sentries.<br><br>The rest were armed with normal or short versions of the SAR-21.<br><br>And I think they picked the 5.7mm P-90 is because its smaller bullet is easier to silence than a 5.56mm bullet, but at the same time still having more range and power than a pistol round like a 9mm.<br><br>If you put a silencer on an M-4 like the Americans, then you would end up with a very long weapon so it is not very ideal.</div>
