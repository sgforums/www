            <div class='col-md body'>Its not really true that military people can be shielded by the National Security act, especially in S'pore.   Otherwise, how else would Jane's intelligent magazines continue to publish its findings?  Or better yet, how else you know the place even exists? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>Its whats going on within the building thats really is a secret, right?  Ha!  Did you know that traders are more secretive then the military?  Why else did te CIA, during Clinton's administration, devote a large analyst resoures into finding out trade secrets.  And knowing a trade secret can sometimes change the events of the world.  1997, a certain muslim PM accused a U.S businessman for manipulating the stocks market which he claimed resulted in the ASIAN crisis. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"><br><br>Military secrets are  meant for the defence of the country &amp; usually are useless information to the public except for those who intend to bring harm to the country. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_neutral.gif" alt="Neutral" title="Neutral"><br><br>In S'pore, I believe the military is far more capable in preventing abuse of information then most countries that I've seen so far.  However, thats not to say that its totally free from abuse because no military in the world is safe from that 1 bad seed, the mole. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br><br>Anyway, S'pore's military spending, with <strong>TAX PAYERs'</strong> money, has been nicely documented in magazines such as Jane's defence mag, etc.</div>
