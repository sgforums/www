Almost the entire BN went to the funeral and he was elevated to a PTE from a recruit. But there was no statue built to commemorate him so I'm not sure what you talking abt. Units get rotated out, new CO comes in will be unlikely to remember what went on in the last intake. The whole thing could be an urban legend, you know how bullsh*t normally gets blown up in SAF.<br><br>However guard duty in 4SIR many happenings, Me and my buddy prowling once during early morning saw a drunk couple literally screwing each other just beyond the fence facing ECP highway because at night that place had many trees and was very dark. I nearly got into a fight with the man because I told them to both FUC*off from the area.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I was from 4 SIR 9th Mono previously.<br>The LCK camp was the old guards camps before 4 SIR took over.<br><br>The statue was there during my time. There were many stories bout it, but dunno whethere true or not. One of the story I recalled was that a whole company who was doing road march actually saw the statue walking down the road.<br><br>So far I never experienced anything out of the ordinary with the statue though i do make a point to look at it in the eyes when i walk pass it cos they say its eye were red. And they were slightly red, but painted.<br><br>The camp was renovated during my time, I still remembered the old Charlie and support block which was renovated first. Charlie had to shift to the HQ block temporarily. But i can't remember where Support went to. After Charlie block and Alpha (previously support) block was ready, it was my company's turn (Bravo) to stay at the HQ block. Oh and we did get to stay in the new blocks for bout 2 months when it was completed, with the new beds, cupboards and all. But by that time most of us were clearing leave.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>10th mono here, all those stories about the statue disappeared with the renovation of the camp.<br><br>I've heard stories about the bravo coy building (sightings, unique and unexplained power failures) and the old 622 blocks though (occasional sightings, general creepy feeling) but nothing major that shocked the entire unit.<br><br>The only major "incident" that did shock the unit ironically happened in P.tekong where we went for exercise.<br><br>I was told when I went in that 4SIR was by "tradition" the infantry unit to score crap for ATEC. But 10th mono changed that by getting the best ATEC score in WY 2002/03; beating CDOs and both guards units by not-a-small margin. We got a high recon 2A for ATEC,  almost kena Charlie Mike for recon 1 in the process. Some c0ckups during the mission ensured that we did not make history getting the rare recon 1 score.<br><br>However as the BCU competition considered a lot of other administrative factors that we weren't good enough to coverup/cheat at, 4SIR only got Silver (or whatever it's called) for BCU.</div>
