Mercy is on a five-month deployment to South Asia, Southeast Asia, and the Pacific Islands. The medical crew aboard Mercy will provide general and ophthalmology surgery, basic medical evaluation and treatment, preventive medicine treatment, dental screenings and treatment, optometry screenings, eyewear distribution, public health training and veterinary services as requested by the host nations. Mercy is uniquely capable of supporting medical and humanitarian assistance needs and is configured with special medical equipment and a robust multi-specialized medical team that can provide a range of services ashore as well as aboard the ship. The medical staff is augmented with an assistance crew, many of whom are part of nongovernmental organizations that have significant medical capabilities.

            <div class='col-md body'>I think there was a British Mercy ship in WWI that was sunk by a German U-boat. Although the ship was painted in International relief colour, Green cross, the Germans still did not give it any chance. The ship was armed with some small guns but it was to no avail.</div>
