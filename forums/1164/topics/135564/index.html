            <div class='col-md body'>LEKIU CLASS FRIGATES, MALAYSIA<br><br>The Kapal DiRaja Lekiu and Kapal DiRaja Jebat frigates were commissioned into the Royal Malaysian Navy in March and May 1999. The Malaysian Ministry of Defence placed a contract on Yarrow Shipbuilders (now BAE Systems Marine) in Glasgow for two light frigates of the Frigate 2000 design. The first ship, the Lekiu (30), was launched in December 1994, with the second, the Jebat (29), following in May 1995. The Jebat carries the lower pennant number to signify the seniority of this ship, which accommodates the Admiral of the Royal Malaysian Navy.<br><br>COMMAND AND CONTROL<br><br>The ship is equipped with the Alenia Marconi Systems Nautis F combat data system. A Radamec Series 2000 Optronic Weapon Director is installed on the roof of the bridge and the ship is also equipped with a Type V 3001 thermal imager from BAE SYSTEMS.<br><br>MISSILES<br><br>The frigatesÂ’ anti-ship missile is the MBDA (formerly EADS Aerospatiale) MM40 Exocet Block II. The two four-cell launchers are installed in the midship section between the two radar masts. The launchers are installed at a fixed angle of elevation, in a crossed configuration, one facing port and one starboard. Range and bearing data are downloaded into the missileÂ’s on-board computer. The missile uses inertial guidance for the cruise phase of the trajectory and then active radar homing by active monopulse seeker head. The sea-skimming missile approaches the target at high subsonic speed, 0.9 Mach.<br><br>The MBDA (formerly Matra BAE Dynamics) Seawolf short-range missile provides protection against supersonic aircraft and anti-ship missiles to a range of 6km. The twelve vertical launchers are installed in front of the bridge. The missile uses a microwave link command-to-line-of-sight guidance system with television and radar tracking. A solid fuel propulsion rocket provides a speed of Mach 2.5.<br><br>GUNS<br><br>The shipÂ’s main gun is the Bofors 57mm gun that fires 2.4kg shells at a rate of 220 rounds/min. The range of the gun is 17km. Two MSI 30 mm guns fire 0.36kg rounds to a range of 10km at a firing rate up to 650 rounds/min.<br><br>On the raised deck at the level of the roof of the helicopter hangar are the Whitehead 324mm B515 triple tube torpedo launchers for lightweight anti-submarine launchers.<br><br>HELICOPTER<br><br>The ship is equipped with a hangar and a helicopter deck with a single landing spot to accommodate an AgustaWestland Lynx helicopter. The 310mÂ° landing deck is also capable of supporting a larger helicopter.<br><br>COUNTERMEASURES<br><br>The ship carries the Sea Siren towed torpedo decoy supplied by BAE Systems. The decoys are controlled over a serial data link to decoy passive and active homing torpedoes. Super Barricade twelve-barrelled chaff launchers are installed on both sides of the ship just forward of the helicopter deck. The frigate is fitted with BAE SYSTEMS Mentor electronic support measures (ESM) and Thales Defence Scimitar electronic countermeasures (ECM) systems.<br><br>SENSORS<br><br>The surface search radar, the Ericsson Sea Giraffe, operating at G and H bands, is positioned high on the main mast. Thales Nederland (formerly Signaal) DA08 air search radar, operating at E and F bands, is installed on the tower to the aft of the main mast.<br><br>Two BAE SYSTEMS 1802 fire control radars, operating at I and J bands, are installed one on the roof deck of the hangar and one on the roof deck of the bridge. The shipsÂ’ I band navigation radar is supplied by Thales Defence.<br><br>The hull mounted Spherion TSM 2633 LF sonar, supplied by Thales Underwater Systems (formerly Thomson Marconi Sonar), operates at medium frequency around 7.5kHz. Spherion uses a spherical acoustic array and provides long-range active sonar for search and attack mode in anti-submarine warfare.<br><br>PROPULSION<br><br>The propulsion system is in a CODAD combined diesel and diesel configuration. The ship has four MTU 20V 1163 TB93 diesel engines, rated at 24.5MW sustained power. The engines drive two shafts with Kamewa controllable pitch propellers. The ship can attain a speed of 28 knots and has a range of over 5,000 miles.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Ha, Talking about RMN and their new boat.<br><br>Question: Why after using MM38 and MM40, they decided to get. Otomat 2 missile?<br><br>Ans: After test firing MM38 and MM 40, they always miss the target.  Why?  MM38/40 means Manual Mat 38/40.  Flying manually by Mat.  So their Defence Dept search thru the internet and found something they are looking for; a Automatic Mat, aka Otomat 2<br><br>Now about RMAF.<br><br>How do they decide how may F/A-18 and Mig 29 to buy?<br><br>Ans: For F/A-18...1 X 8 so they get 8 F/A-18.  For Mig 29?  Yes, you are right, 2 X 9, and the figure comes up to be 18 Mig 29.  Simple right?<br>Luckily we did not use this formula.  If not will will have 4 A4SU, 5 F-5 and 6 F-16...<br><br>Joke aside.  The RMN have improved a lot over the years and with the 2 Lekiu FFG and their Laksamana MCV (roughly equivalent to our MCV), they can be quite a pain in the ***.  And looking at their not-so-future acquisition of 6 MEKO 100 frigates.  The MEKO A-100 RMN patrol vessel being built for Malaysia has a displacement of 1,650t. CAE of Canada is to provide the Integrated Platform Management System (IPMS) that will monitor and control propulsion, electrical and auxiliary systems.<br>The corvettes have one helicopter spot for a helicopter such as AgustaWestland Super Lynx 300 or Sikorsky S-70B Seahawk. Initially, the vessels will be armed with an Oto Melara 76/62 Rapid medium range gun and an Oto Melara/Mauser 30mm short-range gun, but provision is made for the later addition of one RAM (Rolling Airframe Missile) RIM-116A launcher for air defence and two launchers for the MM40 Exocet anti-ship missile. The vessel's combat management system will be the Atlas Elektronik COSYS-110M1 with a TMEO electro-optic fire director from Oerlikon Contraves.<br>The main surveillance radar will be the TRS-3D/16 ES three-dimensional radar from EADS Deutschland. The vessels will also be equipped with MDS 3060 obstacle avoidance sonar and ALEX chaff/decoy launching system. Other systems have yet to be decided.<br><br>Can we say it is as good as our new FFG if not better?<br><br>Based on simple mathematics and numbers.<br><br>Missile boat vs missile boat<br><br>RMN                                                              RSN<br>Lekiu Class (F2000) Frigates                        Formidable Class frigates<br>KD Lekiu (30)                                                RSS Formidable (6<img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"><br>KD Jebat (29)                                                RSS Intrepid (69)<br>RSS Steadfast (70)<br>RSS Tenacious<br>RSS Stalwart<br>RSS Supreme<br><br>Kasturi Class (FS 1500) Frigate<br>KD Kasturi (25)<br>KD Lekir (26)<br><br>Laksamana Class Corvette                           Victory Class Corvette<br>KD Tun Abdul Jamil (135)                               RSS Victory (8<img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"><br>KD Mohammad Amin (136)                             RSS Valour (89)<br>KD Hang Nadim (134)                                    RSS Vigilance (90)<br>KD Tan Pusmah (137)                                    RSS Valiant (91)<br>RSS Vigour (92)<br>RSS Vengeance (93)<br><br>MEKO A-100 RMN Class Corvette<br>KD Pahang<br>KD Kedah<br>KD ?<br>KD ?<br>KD ?<br>KD ?<br><br>Handalan Class (Spica-M) Patrol Craft           Sea Wolf Class Missile Gun Boat<br>KD Handalan P3511                                       RSS Sea Wolf (P76)<br>KD Perkasa P3512                                         RSS Sea Lion (P77)<br>KD Pendekar P3513                                       RSS Sea Dragon (P7<img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"><br>KD Gempita P3514                                         RSS Sea Tiger (P79)<br>RSS Sea Hawk (P80)<br>RSS Sea Scorpion (P81)<br><br>Perdana Class Patrol Craft<br>KD Perdana (3501)<br>KD Ganyang (3504)<br>KD Ganas (3503)<br>KD Serang (3502)<br><br>Total<br><br>22 vessels                                                   18 vessel (6 due for decomm)<br><br>Missile count based on platform<br><br>80 missiles                                                  108 missiles (-12 for 6 decom ships)<br><br>The other thing is their missile system is generally better than ours.  In terms of range and performance.  Otomat 2 have a range of 112nm compared to 100nm of Harpoon. (Both need OTHT using MPA and other ships or helo)  And not forgetting the MM 38 and MM 40 both having a range of 26nm and 40nm respectively.<br><br>So count ourselves lucky that they have few theatres to take care (South China Sea, Straits of Malacca and waters around Sabah/Sarawak). which means at any one time, you would see them all.  If not, we will have problem handling them if something happen.<br>So if one day they decided to go into the serious business.  RSN might not have a chance. So if you think RSN had an easy life with our new frigates?  think again.<br><br>With only 12 missile boat in RSN inventory.  Guess we still have a long way to become a true blue water navy.  We should be contented with being a No1 littoral Navy. (Not little Navy).<br><br>All these figues did not include the air force.  Guess they will be pretty tied up with each other.  I also did not include Anti-Ship Missile (ASM) carrying aircrafts, namely the F-16D, F50MPA and F/A 18.  So hopefully with all these in, we can strike a balance.  And of course, we also don't wish the day that we need to face each other will come.  World Peace.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Does anybody know whether the following (in bold) has any basis? These missiles are supersonic and a naval version has apparently been test-fired.  If eventually sold to RMN, these missiles could possibly be mounted on either the Lekiu frigates or the Laksamana corvettes.<br><br><blockquote>Brahmos Aerospace ties up with Rosoboronexport State Corp<br><br>Vinay Shukla Moscow, April 7 (PTI) Brahmos Aerospace, an Indo-Russian Joint Venture has tied up with Russia's Rosoboronexport State Corporation to globally market its new generation supersonic cruise missiles for naval and air platforms. The Plan on joint export promotion of BrahMos missile systems was inked by Andrey Beliyaninov - Director General of Rosoboronexport, Dr Herbert Yefremov - Director General of NPO Mashinostroyeniya and Dr A Sivathanu Pillai - CEO and Managing Director of BrahMos Aerospace. It visualises undertaking of joint marketing activities, aimed at promotion of 'BrahMos' missile systems of ship-born and air-born applications to foreign markets, Rosoboronexport said in a statement. Under an intergovernmental agreement signed in 1998, India's Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO) and Russia's premier nuclear missile designer and producer NPO Mashnistroyeniya floated the USD 250 Million joint venture in India, in which DRDO has 50.5 per cent equity. "There is a significant interest in the world in BrahMos cruise missiles and many countries have already made inquiries. <strong>However, the decision to sell them to a certain country has to be made jointly by the governments of India and Russia," Dr Pillai told PTI. Although Dr Pillai declined to identify the nations which could be possible buyers of BrahMos missiles, Russian expert Dr Alexander Vaskin believes that Malaysia, Indonesia and Vietnam could get these missiles as "friendly countries". </strong>BrahMos cruise missiles, which are to be inducted by the Indian navy beginning from next year, have been on display in several international arms exhibitions including in Sydney, Singapore and Abu Dhabi and every where potential buyers have been showing keen interest in them. "As of today and in a decade to come BrahMos has no match in the world in its class. It is a smart weapon system, you only need to feed the co-ordinates of the target, and it hits precisely overcoming enemy electronic counter-measures. It is a versatile tactical cruise missile of the range of 290 km and can be fired from ships, submarines, land-based mobile launchers, silos and aircraft," Dr Pillai said. The BrahMos supersonic missile capable of cruising at the altitude ranging from 10 metres to 10 kilometres flies to its target at the speed of Mach 2.8 - almost three times faster than sound, leaving no time for the adversary to react. According to Russian experts, BrahMos missile is three times faster than the highly publicised US Tomahawk cruise missile and two missiles are enough to sink an enemy aircraft carrier.

They are by all means more capable than our MCV,  both weapon and sensor.  And by the way, the Lynx onboard Lekiu does not used as ASW platform only.  They can be used as radar pickets, OTHT and ESM platform.  So just for detection range is much more further than our Sea giraffe onboard our MCV.<br><br>The Meko 100 is definitely much more cpapble than our PV, APV if you are refer to them.

They are by all means more capable than our MCV,  both weapon and sensor.  And by the way, the Lynx onboard Lekiu does not used as ASW platform only.
