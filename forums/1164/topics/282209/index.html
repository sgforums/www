Do you play a lot of flight sims, and enjoy flying?<br><br>How familiar are you with the physics of flight?<br><br>I feel that you should only sign on with RSAF is you really have the interest, and not consider being a combat pilot as just a career opportunity. If you really have genuine interest in flying, your knowledge about it, the machines, will show.  Recruitment officers can see that.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Well, i do know the basic physics on why a plane can fly, my modules cover aeronautical engineering science, i do have a strong interest in flying.<br>I failed to join YFC(youth flying club) because my CCA and timetable don't fit well.<br><br>It has always been a childhood dream to be a pilot, which is why i took up Aerospace Engineering DIP, if i cannot fly, i want to let the pilot fly with a piece of mind.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>my advice is to try and pursue your dream until the end, in bmt i applied for it. being a fighter pilot was the strongest dream in my life, i passed the computerised test, and i went for the medical, but i was then called up for a second medical. supposedly there was a problem with my heart.<br><br>during that time i contracted lung infection and had attn C for 1 week plus, i missed SIT test and was still on status when i returned and could not go the make up sit test.<br><br>i was heavily demoralised as i inferred that i could not go to OCS thus it was impossible for me to be a pilot, so i canceled my second medical and application.<br><br>but until now i wonder, and its a big regret to me, i should have saw it through to the end, and had an answer even though it was a big propability of a no, instead of now i wonder if i had continued would there be a small chance.<br><br>so good luck! its good to know what planes singapore operates! like F-16 , F-5's, C-130's, kc-135's. and future planes being aquired, such as F-15 SG, i heard that they would ask sometimes in the interview.</div>
