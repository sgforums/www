              <p>lol dude. u completely missed my point.</p>
              <p>what i m saying is, to keep them guessing isnt going to work permanently. Secrets arent going to remain secrets forever. there are always conventional means to obtain the information (spies and tracking weapon sales) and military means, such as spy satellites, electronic emissions and logistics trails.</p>
              <p>improvement in satellite resolution (today's commercial picture satellites have resolutions that used to be military grade ) newer technologies (SAR -synthetic aperture radar : allows u to build a picture quality images of whats going on the ground like X rays on the human body) may make hiding them quite pointless.</p>
              <p>what happens if they discover that its a bluff ?what i m suggesting is that it might be better to have the real thing, accept higher tensions than risk someone calling your bluff. </p>

              <p>Iskander E is a solid booster missile, with minimal maintenance required.  I assume the warhead guidance electronics would require regular attention.  Overall lower than a couple squadrons of Flankers.</p>

              <p>like someone mentioned before, an interest dosent equate into buying it. dont need to lose sleep or worry about it all night long.</p>
              <p>1) havent you heard the famous adage ? the russians will sell their mothers for the right price. we just might be able to get S300s if the right amount of funds are avaliable in the hands of the right people. might be able to get it on the quiet too.</p>
              <p>2) a static BMD system might be a trade-off in terms of tactical liability but we might get more than that if we get the arrow2. like with most of our military deals, it might include a technology transfer or special customization from our Mexican friends. it might even be custom-made into a mobile system for us. Might have more spinoffs for us too.</p>
              <p>3) Patriot ? lets see who has it in the region. SK has some, TW just bought some (its on display outside the presidential palace in taipei, can see it if you take a cab and drive past the area), Japan has some. </p>
              <p>that leaves pretty much Thailand and US(singapore) who fall into the threat radius of XX country's ballistic missiles (interpret XX howsoever you like, there's more than 1 nation with ballistic missiles in theater).</p>
              <p>thailand cant get it because they signed the ABM proliferation treaty. that leaves us as the only major US ally within a threat ring posed by ballistic missiles in the region (unless you wanna count australia too but that might be technically impractical. most aussie cities are along the southern coast)</p>
              <p>us getting it may not be that much of a financial constraint, but rather a regionalized political constraint (asean non-amity agreement: i.e we wont fight with each other)</p>
              <p>4) standard system ? doubt it. we probably made the commitment to another family of SAM missiles when we bought the Formidable. </p>
              <p>like tankie mentioned. it really has to do with status quo. if we do get something like that, might upset someone else's sensibilities and percieved sense of insecurity. thats the big danger.</p>

              I wouldn't like it if either the MAF or SAF got their hands on SRBMs.  Its a bad idea both ways. If anything comes into mind together with SRBMs, it would be WMDs and FAEs.  With weapons such as the Strike Eagle and JSOW coming in, we shouldn't need to look at SRBMs.
              
              If the MAF does acquire such weapons, anyone involved in a conflict against them will have to strike pre-emptively.  Such pre-emptive strikes would be rapid and brutal in order prevent any possibilities of launch.  Though killing the launchers would be ideal, taking out the military command structure, or political structure will suffice as well.

              <p>I couldn't agree more. Since Singapore is a tiny island, having a highly mobile and low observable 'launcher' which is the stealth frigate, coupled with a long ranged missile like the Aster 30...we will have a highly effective air defence umbrella.</p>
              <p>Should we need to extend our air defence cover we can simply sail our 6 frigates to where ever we need them and place them at specific coordinates where there is an over-lap of air cover from each individual vessel to create a large mobile air defence umbrella.</p>
              <p>Land-based launchers may be mobile but in tiny Singapore there isn't much place to move around while at sea it is very different.</p>

              <p>Iskander is not an ordinary missile. It doesn't follow the standard ballistic flight path (it actually has evading algorithms and such), and while it is possible to intercept it, you have to be on the constant look out for it. If the enemy is smart, they would use this weapon in conjuction with SEAD missiles.</p>
              <p>Solution 1 is to have either S-300PMU-2 system, or the Patriot system. Solution 2 is to try a laser defence system but that is years away.</p>
              <p>The Russians are known to have sold their S-300PMU-2 systems to NATO people like Turkey. In any case, the US has more or less gotten hold of a copy, quite likely through Ukraine.</p>
