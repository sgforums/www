            <div class='col-md body'>It is widely believed that China will used this unit to deal with Taiwan if she should declare INDEPENDENCE. Reason why not PLA is simple as China will tell the world that it her internal issue and oni police force was used. Therefor it is not a WAR and no one can interfere.<br>Downsize of PLA but upsize in PAP.<br><br>From http://www.sinodefence.com/army/special/papspecial.asp<br><br>In response to the growing threat of international and domestic terrorism activities, particularly airline hijackings, China established a dedicated anti-terrorism special police force on 22 July 1982. Originally led by the Ministry of Public Security, the Chinese police authority, this special police unit was later subordinated to the People's Armed Police (PAP) Forces in 1983.<br><br>Originally known as the "Unit 722", the special police unit was later officially named as "The People's Armed Police Special Police Group". In 1985 it became "The People's Armed Police Special Police School" and began to recruit students. Later in 2000 it became a three-year college. The college is currently based in the suburb of Beijing, and PAP internal security units around the country also have established their own dedicated anti-terrorism and riot-control branches.<br><br>Meanwhile the PAP Special Police is a combat unit as well as an armed police college, which consists of two departments: special police and reconnaissance, each with three student teams. Students receive three years of education and training in the college, and obtain college diploma after graduation. The majority of the college graduates become officers in the PAP anti-terrorism units around the country, while those with best grade become members of the college's elite anti-terrorism unit.<br><br>Like most anti-terrorism forces around the world, the PAP Special Police receives the best equipment as well as toughest training. Their missions include anti-terrorism, anti-hijacking, hostage rescuing, riot control. The PAP Special Police also assists the special police (SWAT) teams of the local public security authorities (police services) in dealing with violent criminals.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Taiwan had and has being internal security issue to China and if oni PAPF are used, it will not be call an invasion or war but will be maintaining law &amp; order. What I am saying is, by using PAPF, US will not have so much so to say.<blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by Moxie:</div><div class="quote_body">I don't think so.

            <div class='col-md body'>Why the need to use force outright?<br><br>Move for Taiwan's INDEPENDENCE only has 25% population's support.<br><br>The president and the DPP has less than 50% of those who voted.<br><br>If he pushes too hard, China has only to make the stock market crash before the govt 's support will start to waiver.<br><br>I think PAP is only for internal control only. Less effective for Taiwan.<br><br>Of course I'm wrong.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I am living in Shanghai for the past 3 years.<br><br>China has 2 types of police: Civilian Police (Min Jing) and Paramilitary Police (Wu Jing).<br><br>In most cities I've been to including Shanghai and Beijing, the Min Jing are not armed. Only the Wu Jing are armed.<br><br>The Min Jing are dressed like you would expect a police force to be dressed with peaked caps and blue uniforms. The Wu Jing are dressed in smart green uniforms also with peaked caps.<br><br>Min Jing are usually made up of locals, eg in Beijing all the Min Jing are Beijiners. Whereas the Wu Jing is always made up of people from other provinces to ensure they do not sympathise with the locals should a local revolt break out.<br><br>Min Jing performs all normal police duties including traffic control and look less impressive and will have old or flabby-looking officers.<br><br>Wu Jing are superfit country boys and very highly-disciplined. They perform internal security duties and are armed normally with pistols and Chinese 5.8mm AK-type weapons for guard duties. Or chromed ceremonial SKS rifles if guarding embassies or important bridges.<br><br>I used to live near the German Ambassador's house which is guarded by Wu Jing details. After a while I got to know some of the friendier fellows and would chat with them on the way home. Though very friendly, they are still careful about talking about things related to their military life etc.<br><br>Some Chinese friends told me stories that sometimes, the PLA would be called in to deal with certain particularly nasty internal trouble like banditry or rebellions in border regions. During these incidents, the PLA will wear Wu Jing uniforms to keep the whole thing low profile.</div>
