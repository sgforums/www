            <div class='col-md body'>By DAVID BROOKS<br>THE NEW YORK TIMES<br><br>SOLDIERS in all wars are called upon to be heroes, but American troops in Iraq are called upon to define a new sort of heroism. First, they must endure the insanity of war - fighting off Fedayeen ambushes, withstanding suicide bombings and mortars, kicking down doors and searching homes.<br><br>But a day or an hour or a few minutes later, they are called upon to enter an opposite moral universe. They are asked to pass out textbooks, improvise sewer systems and help with budgets. Some sit in on town council meetings to help keep the discussion on track. Some act like foundation programme officers, giving seed money to promising local initiatives.<br><br>Trained as trigger-pullers, many are also asked in theatre to be consultants and aldermen. They are John Wayne but also Jane Addams (a Nobel laureate and American social worker).<br><br>Can anybody think of another time in history when a comparable group of young people was asked to be at once so brave, fierce and relentless, while also being so sympathetic, creative and forbearing?<br><br>When you read the dispatches from Iraq, or the online diaries many soldiers keep, or the e-mail messages they send home, you quickly sense how hard it is to commute between these two universes. Yet, their most important achievements seem to occur on the border between chaos and normalcy.<br><br>At spontaneous moments, when order threatens to break down, the soldiers, aviators and marines jump in and coach the Iraqis on the customs and habits of democracy. They try to weave that fabric of civic trust that can't be written into law, but without which freedom becomes anarchy.<br><br>For example, in a New Yorker article, George Packer describes an incident in the life of Captain John Prior. He was inside a petrol station when a commotion erupted outside. A mob was furiously accusing a man of butting in line and stealing petrol. Capt Prior established that the man was merely a government inspector checking the quality of the fuel. Frazzled and exhausted, he took the chance to teach the mob a broader lesson: 'The problem is that you people accuse each other without proof! That's the problem!'<br><br>Another soldier, who keeps a weblog, collects toys and passes them out to Iraqi children. He took a pile of toys to an orphanage, but the staff at the place rushed to grab the toys for themselves - 'like sharks in a feeding frenzy', he writes. He has learnt that if he stations himself with an M-16 over the toys, things go smoothly.<br><br>Another soldier writes of his dismay at seeing Iraqi parents give their children toy guns as presents after Ramadan. He wonders: 'Haven't they had enough death? Don't they realise how dangerous it is for a kid to wander the street with a piece of plastic that looks like an AK-47?'<br><br>When you read the diaries and the postings of the soldiers in Iraq, you see how exhausted they are. You see that their feelings about the Iraqis are as contradictory as the Iraqis' feelings about them. You see their frustration and yearning to go home.<br><strong><br>But despite all this, their epic bouts of complaining are interrupted by bursts of idealism. Most of them seem to feel, deep down, some elemental respect for the Iraqis and sympathy for what they have endured. Far more than the population at home, the soldiers in the middle of the conflict believe in their mission and are confident they will succeed.<br></strong><br>When you read their writings, you see what thorough democrats they are. They are appalled at the thought of dominating Iraq. They want to see the Iraqis independent and governing themselves. If some president did want to create an empire, he couldn't do it with these people. Their faith in freedom governs their actions.<br><strong><br>Most of all, you see what a challenging set of tasks they have been given, and how short-staffed they are. Yet, you sense that in this war, as in so many others, the improvising skill of the soldiers on the ground will make up for the cosmic screw-ups of the people up the chain of command.<br></strong><br>If anybody is wondering: Where are the young idealists? Where are the people willing to devote themselves to causes larger than themselves? They are in uniform in Iraq, straddling the divide between insanity and order.<br><br>[/quote]<br><br>find it very meaningful.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br><br>its sad tt despite their kindness and goodwill, they bear the brunt of all the worst attacks from enemies who were enraged by what someone much higher up in the chain of command did.<br><br>but well, tts a soldier's life - he has sworn allegiance to his country, and will do whatever his country commands him to, regardless of his personal feelings, and his personal safety.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>yea..very touching..<br>but too bad..the US govt treat them like shit...<br>they got not enough gear to pass around..they have to buy own stuff..check this url out---&gt;<br><br><a href="http://www.globalsecurity.org/org/news/2003/030911-boots01.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.globalsecurity.org/org/news/2003/030911-boots01.htm</a><br><br><span class="large">American troops forced to buy own wartime gear<br><br>By TARA COPP &amp; JESSICA WEHRMAN </span><br>Last Christmas, Mike Corcoran sent his mother an unusual Christmas list: He wanted night-vision goggles, a global positioning system and a short-wave radio. Corcoran, then a Marine sergeant in Afghanistan, wanted the goggles so he could see on patrols. They cost about $2,000 each.<br><br>According to an Army internal report released earlier this summer, many ground troops like Corcoran decided to dip into their own pockets to get the equipment they needed to fight in Afghanistan and in Iraq.<br><br>"There were a lot of reports of that prior to the war, people would go out and buy their own gear," said Patrick Garrett, a defense analyst with GlobalSecurity.org. "The Army ran out of desert camo boots, and a lot of soldiers were being issued regular black combat boots. Soldiers decided that wasn't for them, so they paid for new boots with their own money."<br><br>According to the Pentagon's "Operation Iraqi Freedom Lessons Learned" draft report, soldiers spent their own money to get better field radios, extra ammunition carriers to help them fight better and commercial backpacks because their own rucksacks were too small.<br><br>Senior Airman Joe Harvey, based at McGuire AFB in New Jersey, said his clothing allowance is $200 a year from the Air Force, and that most aspects of the uniform, including four sets of combat and dress uniforms are provided.<br><br>"But of course with all the wear and tear they don't always last that long," said Harvey, who deployed to Iraq for the war. "Now with some of the units if you rip a pair of bdu's (battle dress uniform) they will give you a new pair. But for the most part you are responsible for buying any new uniform you need except for boots. Your unit will always supply with a free pair of boots."<br><br>Harvey said the costs stack up during promotions, when each airman has to purchase new stripes and get them tailored on.<br><br>Corcoran, who has since left the Marines, purchased a bunch of items before he deployed. One necessity: baby wipes, because as he said, "a lot of the places you'll go, you won't be taking a shower."<br><br>Corcoran also bought his own rucksack, and modified a sling for his M-16 so he was better prepared for patrols. He bought an electric shaver to remove stubble that would keep his gas mask from sealing correctly.<br><br>Corcoran got all the items on his Christmas list, including the $2,000 goggles. The short wave radio was meant for entertainment, but he ended up hearing messages urging jihad, and he picked up intelligence from enemy fighters.<br><br>And there is one item many soldiers purchased and carried into the desert that wasn't part of the regular equipment.<br><br>"Another cool thing to bring with you is an American flag," Corcoran said. "Just in case you plan on conquering anything."<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I oppose the war and current occupation in Iraq with a passion, but as a soldier myself it breaks my heart when I hear or read about more American soldiers dying in Iraq, as it means someone has lost a son, husband, father and/or brother.<br><br>Unlike what most Bush-ites think about us anti-war/anti-Bush people, I do not cheer when another American soldier dies in Iraq. I feel sad for the loss by their families, and can imagine what it would be like if I'm the one affected. It really causes one to reflect, especially when you read about stories like the soldier who died in the shot-down Chinook who was on his way back to the States because his mother had died earlier<br><br>I do not agree with the reasons the Americans are there, but I reserve the anger and loathing for the politicians that put them there. And I'm saddened by every death that occurs because of their leader's sins. They will never understand what their men go through.<br><br>I hope all this madness in Iraq ends soon.</div>
