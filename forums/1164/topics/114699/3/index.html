            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by Weirdo80:</div><div class="quote_body">Once again, I have NO IDEA where you're getting your stories from. Firstly, if only SMGs have the full-auto capability, why does the M16A1/M16S1 have the full auto mode?? They were designed as "assault rifles", mind you. Also, the M4 HAS FULL AUTO! Where do you get your doctrines from?<br><br>The Ak-47 was NOT DESIGNED AS AN SMG. According to SovietArmy.com, " It was the basic individual infantry weapon of the Soviet Army until the introduction of the AKM." Do you give new recruits SMGs to fire?? Does a BMT recruit learn how to shoot terrorists in a 747 cabin on the first day of BMT? And NOBODY chambers an SMG with a 7.62 x 39 mm round, dude. The Ak-47 is 86.9cm long. At that length, it would not perform well as an SMG for FIBUA/MOUT fights in confined spaces. Your claim that the AK-47 was used in ambushes on full-auto with results is dubious. According to Jane's, "The barrel overheats quickly when the weapon fires for extended periods, making the weapon hard to handle and occasionally causing a round to explode prematurely in the chamber. " I don't think anyone in his right mind would use the AK-47 as a section/platoon support weapon lor. That's why they came up with the RPD and RPK. One more thing, the Vietcong were strapped for ammo and weapons, unlike their NVA counterparts in the North. They were using a mish-mash of AKs, SKSs, Mosin-Nagants and captured US weapons. Do you think they used ammo very freely? Also, first-hand accounts mentioned that the Vietcong were adept at SNIPING, not spraying. If you want to hit someone accurately, you do not fire on full-auto. Besides, the AK-47 DOES NOT have a bipod like the BAR, making the recoil of automatic fire something that the firer has to bear. Firing 7.62mm rounds on full auto without support? You watch too many movies......<br><br>It's true that the M249 and M240 are better for auto fire - that's what they were designed for (there isn't even a semi-auto mode for these weapons). However, according to the NATO TOE, M249s cost 2.5 times more than M16A2s, and M240s cost 3.3 times more than M16A2s. How much will it cost to field an army of machine gunners? Plus the fact that each gunner needs about a thousand rounds of ammo. Not practical. And what happens when you see a sniper in the window 100m away? Waste 20 rounds spraying into the whole building? Wouldn't a well-placed rifle shot do the trick?</div></blockquote>Did I in anyway claimed that you're bullshitting? If no, why the hell are you busting my balls?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_evil.gif" alt="Evil or Very Mad" title="Evil or Very Mad"><br>Have you ever fired M16 on full -auto &amp; compare it with firing a SMG?  M16/M4 fires semi-auto, period.  Where do I get my doctrines?  From my years in  United States Army, happy.<br>I would not give a recruit a SMG but that does not mean the Russkis won't.  In any case have you gone through Russian military trainning to speak on their behalf?<br>Did I also talked about using AKs for MOUTs?  I know I didn't but the Russian were using it in Beslan during the school hostage situation.<br>Have you ever been in an ambush fight?  It usually don't last more then 15mins because after emptying 1 clip, the ambusher would high-tail out of the fight.  So theres no extended period of fight to worry about barrel over heating.  Just look at the Iraqi militants, they are not fighting any U.S troop for prolong face on confrontation.  Instead, preferring to fire off blindly &amp; then run off.<br>The Russkis &amp; China were supplying the VCs with ammos &amp; weapons, so yeah, the VCs could fire off auto.  If you're not convince, check the the vietnam ops record.  You'll see how many weapons dumb site were hit during that war, yet the VCs still had enough ammos &amp; weapons to last.<br>You obiviously haven't fired an AK-47 to talk to me about its recoil impact, either that or you don't know how to hold onto the weapon.<br>Now you talk about sniper attack.  U.S Marines' respond to a sniper attack, is 1 round from the barrel of an M1 tank or hellfire missiles from a cobra gunship.  U.S Army responded to Saddam's son AK-47 fire with with no less then 2 TOW missile, 3 50.cal mounted guns, a battalion of infantry &amp; a team of SpecOps.

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><br>Have you ever fired M16 on full -auto &amp; compare it with firing a SMG?<br></blockquote>Yes I have, and I have also been trained in the operation and tactical use of the MP5A4 submachine gun. I have also fired the FN P90. The M16 definetely gives more kick than the MP5, but controllable by a trained rifleman.<br><br><blockquote>M16/M4 fires semi-auto, period.</blockquote>Wrong. The M16A1 and the M4 have semi and auto modes of fire. The M16A2/A3/A4 have semi and three-round burst modes. Surely anyone who has done basic training in the US army knows this. The study of the M16A2 rifle is one of the common task tests in basic - surely you could not have passed this and not known that the M16A2 has a three-round burst mode? In week 4 you have marksmanship training.<br><br><blockquote><br>I would not give a recruit a SMG but that does not mean the Russkis won't.  In any case have you gone through Russian military trainning to speak on their behalf? </blockquote>Sir, according to Russian military directives, recruits are to be issued only with the AK-47 7.62mm or AK-74 5.56mm assault rifles. Only Spetnaz troopers are issued with the folding-butt AKS-74 assault rifle. None of these are sub-machine guns.<br><br><blockquote><br>Did I also talked about using AKs for MOUTs?  I know I didn't but the Russian were using it in Beslan during the school hostage situation.<br>Have you ever been in an ambush fight?

Just look at the Iraqi militants, they are not fighting any U.S troop for prolong face on confrontation.  Instead, preferring to fire off blindly &amp; then run off. </blockquote>Firstly, it takes much less than 15 minutes to empty a clip. Secondly, you are generalising that all ambushes are short-term encounters. Let me give you 2 examples of this not being true. This is not an exhaustive list.<br><br>November 1965. The battle of Ia Drang valley, in which 450 US soldiers found themselves surrounded by 2,000 NVA troops. What ensued was an intense engagement where the US soldiers were repeatedly engaged. It lasted 3 days. Not 15 minutes.<br><br>February 22 - April 14, 1968. The siege of Khe Sanh. The 26th Marine regiment were under the attack by NVA forces trying to take over their firebase. According to Bruce M. Geiger, platoon leader of support platoon, 1st company 26th Marine regiment, the NVA and VC forces used SNIPERS to constantly harrass them. Not automatic fire. Automatic fire was only encountered when the enemy tried to rush their base. And this engagement lasted over 2 months. Not 15 minutes.<br><br><blockquote><br>The Russkis &amp; China were supplying the VCs with ammos &amp; weapons, so yeah, the VCs could fire off auto.  If you're not convince, check the the vietnam ops record.  You'll see how many weapons dumb site were hit during that war, yet the VCs still had enough ammos &amp; weapons to last. </blockquote>I think you mean dump site :-)  The continuous bombing and harrassment of the Ho Chi Minh trail meant that obtaining supplies from the North was extremely dicey. This made ammunition and weapons hard to obtain and sustain. Therefore the Vietcong had to resort to stealing weapons from the Americans. The massive caches of weapons found were mainly US weapons and supplies. However, this made it more confusing for the VC who had to then field multiple calibres of weapons. The bombing strikes of Linebacker I and II, Rolling Thunder and subsequent attacks nearly obliterated the North's ability to resupply. With no assistance from their Northern allies, the VCs were strapped for ammo, weapons and supplies. Any respectable soldier makes every bullet count, but for the VC it was even more important to do so. That dearth of modern weapons gave rise to the usage of home-made explosives and booby traps (punji stake, spiked balls, etc)<br><br><blockquote><br>You obiviously haven't fired an AK-47 to talk to me about its recoil impact, either that or you don't know how to hold onto the weapon. </blockquote>I have, thank you very much, and I believed I was sufficiently trained in the basic handling and firing of that weapon. Still, I experienced much tighter groupings on semi-auto than auto. Any respectable infantry-trained man will tell you that you are more accurate on semi and save ammunition thus extending your duration of lethality. That's why the auto mode was disabled from the M16A2 and subsequent models.<br><br><blockquote><br>Now you talk about sniper attack.  U.S Marines' respond to a sniper attack, is 1 round from the barrel of an M1 tank or hellfire missiles from a cobra gunship.

But let me expand on your point.<br>M16A2 is a semi-auto rifle.  M16A3 is not issued to most soldiers unless your part of a sniper/scout team.  The M16A3 has the full auto fire selection &amp; is also known as the M16A3 sniper rifle not because its used as the primary sniping rifle but rather as the spotter's support weapon.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br>The M4 it self does not have the full auto fire selection either.  Its the M4A1 that has the full auto fire selection.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"></div>
