            <div class='col-md body'>Guys, for those of you who need prescription, I'd suggest you look into getting something like the ESS with the Rx insert. Your daily prescription glasses is not going to do the job unless it clearly is made from similar materials.<br><br>Spec-Ops, if you thinking about getting a pair of ESS, let me know. That $120 price in Singapore is ridiculous. I've just outfitted a unit in Malaysia with the new ESS Naro (for smaller faces).<br><br>I also just received a sample of a their Tactical Kit prototype based on a recommendation I made several months back that full-time shooters do not like to change out their lenses; we prefer two separate frames so the new Tac kit comes with 2 frames and 3 lenses but this will not be available until next year.</div>

Most of their shooting glasses and goggles allow prescription lenses with their RX-inserts.  BUT, it means u need to go get the lenses cut to fit the RX-inserts.  I recommend contact lenses instead. =)</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Shotgun, I did not inquire into the same packaging for NARO but I do not see why they would not conisder it. The packaging is porduced outright and with the slits cut into the foam inside, it will fit both the regular ones and the NARO. When they pack each package, it is a question of picking up components from parts bins. I'm sure they will offer the NARO in the Tac Kit.<br><br>Meia, you're welcome bud.</div>
