              <p>Hi All,</p>
              <p>I am completely new to this forum. I was doing research for an article for a Wargaming magazine (Miniature Wargames in the UK) and came across and old topic regarding Han Chinese &amp; The Roman Emperor Trajan, posted by Texcoco II. </p>
              <p>I would like to use this thread as a basis for my synopsis for the article, and would happily post pictures of the armies as I get them done for the article.</p>
              <p>Now, i do not want to step on anyone's toes, so if there is an outrage for me using this content in an article I'd like to hear about it.</p>
              <p>Thanks from Snowy Denmark</p>

              <p>In the articles No Roman needed...</p>
              <p>Many of the villagers have Western characteristics including green eyes and blonde hair leading some experts to suggest that they may be the descendants of a lost Roman legion that settled in the area.</p>
              <p>Now DNA testing of the villagers has shown that almost two thirds of them are of Caucasian origin.</p>
              <p><strong>If the “Roman Chinese” are genuinely Roman, they will have this specific southwest European ancestry, which will put them at a distinction from the Uyghurs</strong></p>
              <p>But hold your breath itachinos..................</p>
              <p>The modern Uyghurs <a href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/gnxp/2009/09/yes-uyghurs-are-a-new-hybrid-population/"><span style="color: #8a7a4a;">are a clear hybrid population</span></a>. In the papers published on the Uyghurs they shake out as about a 50/50 West/East Eurasian mix.</p>
              <p>The Chinese-like element may simply be that the proto-Uyghurs were already admixed with the Han populations, or, that that element has a geography-conditional cline where the Yakuts are at an extreme</p>

              <p>    Don'[t forget that whenn the foreign armies were marching up from the Tianjin River they wer blocked off by a huge Chinese army 5 times larger than the foreign contingent. Of the Foreign contingent the Japanese charged the Chinese forces and the Chinese forces ran. The Japanese would have been outnumbered ten to one or more.</p>

They had ongoing battles with Tibetans, Manchurians,Mongolians turks etc...</p>
