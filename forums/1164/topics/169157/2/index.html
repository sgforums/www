Truth be told, there's very little for a moderator to do on that board, as the participants are extremely mature, respectful and, above all, willing to help each other. The board is essentially self-moderating.<br><br>Glad you like (liked?) the 75B SA! I got my start in handgunning with a 9mm 75B back in the late-90s. Since then, I've ventured into other brands of pistols, but always find myself coming back to the CZs. For the money, you won't find a line of pistols that is more reliable, accurate and ergonomically ideal than the CZs. In fact, I trust my life to one, as I carry a 40S&amp;W CZ 100.<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Edited to add:</span> Just thought I'd throw in an image of the pistol that started my addiction all those years back:<br><br><img src="http://i12.photobucket.com/albums/a221/screwthepap/CZ75B_Small.jpg"><br><br>It's a 9mm CZ 75B. It was the very first gun I acquired in this country, and it remains the most accurate, reliable and comfortable 9mm firearm I've ever handled and shot thus far. It's still my primary 9mm pistol, and it'll be a cold day in hell before I part with it.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Interestingly, the gangsta-style shooting technique has been used by users of the mauser C96 pistol at the turn of / early 20th century, esp. soldiers of the Chinese warlords. Fired on automatic, the pistol has tremendous upward kick, causing the firer to miss the target further with each successive rounds. To get around this problem (sort of) the pistol is fired sideways, turning the upward jerk into a horizontal one, giving a nice spread of bullets. Useful if firing against massed enemy.</div>
