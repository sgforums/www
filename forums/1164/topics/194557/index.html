Till last year, till malaysia got their new tanks, AMX-13 have nothing worth to shoot at but support role of support fire to take out bunkers and stuff.

In fact US have to rush a bunch of them to Iraq recently. One think it is still good to have them upgrade to m133a3 with better engine, and protection and new fuel tank. They are still super vehicles to have that can be light and easily transport by C-130. If you arm a M113A3 with tow missiles - it still can take out tanks.<br><br>AMX-10 - think the buy came about when Singapore is learning to design its own bionix. And AMX-10 was one of the better design that can swim.  Thus the AMX-10 purchase to you maybe crappy, but it may have help us to design our own bionix.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>bro!! this is a modern warfare its no longer like those days in WW1 or WW2. Where "Whao!! the tanks are here quick run for your life!!" the infantry carrys anti-tank weapons.<br><br>Btw singapore has such a long lasting peace since the independent was partially due to the politcal/military backing  from the FPDA member ie. britain and australia they played an active role in these early day but the backing was tone down when singapore airforce was then gradually developing herself a credible force to be reckon<br>Airforce rules  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"><br><br>Tell me how are the Amx-13s gonna deter this menace. They could be blow up by  anti-tank before it even start aiming or approach a fortified building <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"> .The thin armour gives little protection to the crew and the compartment is like an oven. it will demoralise the troops in real war situation.The prima and fighters will probably be much more effective.<br><br>The pathetic looking Amx-13 cant be compared with those technologically advanced  modern days "big brother".  In terms of crew protection, in terms of computerised targetting, stabliser etc. Whenever i have had a chance to look @ the tank. I cant help it but to ask "singapore has such a sophisticated and refined armed force so much procurement teh F-16, F-15, Bionix, Eurobridge, Sar21, ultimax upgrade, primas, infantry21, apache, spike anti-tank, hellfire, matador,Formidable frigate etc but yet they refuse to replace this 3 decades old junk.<br>i thought a decent tank is the pride of the army.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>i'm in armour now. obviously tanks are killed by anti-tank missles, duh~<br><br>they aren't called ATGMs for nothing. however, it is still quite difficult to hit a moving tank on the first try. takes quite a few shots to get the aim correct, and by then the tank would be alerted to ur presence and take evasive actions.<br><br>anyways, dun look down on our tanks. u think MBTs can move on malaysia's jungle roads? however, i do think the gun on the SM1 is a tad weak</div>

Tracks are good, wheels are bad IMO.<br><br>And the armour on the Stryker is paper thin due to the need for airborne deployment. So the Stryker, M113 has the same problem with the AMX-13 of being easily destroyed by 0.5HMG and RPG.<br><br>Unless you do like the IDF and completely up-armour the hull of the M113, otherwise it is another death-trap. Along with up-armouring the hull of the M113, the IDF also uses ex-MBT hulls of Centurion etc and turn them in super armoured APCs.<br><br>Also reference the Merkava series. Engine in front, slow and heavy for a modern MBT. Why? Heavy armour protection for the crew.<br><br>What does this tell you about these superb users of armour? Wars have taught them that armour protection is primary importance over and above all other considerations in the IDF.<br><br>And the issue with our large force of M113 and AMX-13 and AMX-10PAC is that armour protection is very low.<br><br>While it is nice to have something light enough for airborne deployment, this makes the air-deployable AFV an interim platform at best and once situation stabilises, you must bring in the heavier armoured stuff otherwise your crews in these light vehicles will be dogmeat to cheaply available RPG-7s.<br><br>And I'm rather skeptical of this air-transportable "power-projection" requirement for armoured vehicles for Singapore.<br><br>We are SAF, not USMC. We do not need to "power-project" to far off exotic locations - we shouldn't.<br><br>Let other people sort out their own mess. We just need to have a very kilat amphibious landing capability as our main threats are in the neighbourhood.<br><br>The reason ST Kinetics is making everything air-transportable is because the main aim of STK is exporting - hopefully - to the USA. For SAF, air transportability of AFVs is a "nice to have", but I think not absolutely necessary.<br><br>Crew protection is what SAF is seriously lacking.<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by storywolf:</div><div class="quote_body">AMX-10 - think the buy came about when Singapore is learning to design its own bionix. And AMX-10 was one of the better design that can swim.  Thus the AMX-10 purchase to you maybe crappy, but it may have help us to design our own bionix. </div></blockquote>True, no really great amphibious tanks had ever been produced even during WW2 when there was so much emphasis. So it must mean one thing: it is very, very difficult to build good amphibious tanks as it is impossible to compromise between "flotability", armour protection and speed in the water.<br><br>Anything being able to do both - ie swim in water and fight on land - usually means it is good at only one or worse: bad at both.<br><br>So I think we shouldn't even look at buying another amphibious tank. The concept should be a plaform that will swim the tanks individually onto shore in double quick time. So maybe look at building super agile LST, not another amph tank.<br><br>Or look at another way to design amphibious tanks. Most amph tanks are basically armoured vehicles trying to do a boat's job while at sea. Why not turn it upside down and design a armoured boat that can do a tank's job once ashore?</div>

However, one must note that until recently when Malaysia ordered their PT-91M, our official SM1 tank fleet of 350 are the largest and most capable in this region. Their job is to provided the AI in their M113 Ultra and BX with greater firepower. One can see that they more than capable in this job. Together with our unofficial big brothers (MBTs)  we are clearly the strongest armoured force in SEA. Therefore there is little to worry about at this point of time.<br><br>Please don't misunderstand me. Having being trained in one myself, i can't wait for its replacement to come! However, one must understand that RnD takes time, mistakes can and will happen during the process. Time is required for testing and evaluation. There is also politics involved, sometimes we cannot reveal a military weapon at certain times. So let us all be patient for SM1's replacement and not condemned it unnecessarily.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"><br></div>

Spare parts are also hard to come by. So it will be not economical to pay for old tanks and spend even more on training thye crew and maintaining the vehicles. Timor Leste hardly have the kind of money for this kind of purchase.<br><br>I think what they need now are second-hand armoured vehicles on wheels. Firstly,being second-hand they will be cheaper. Wheeled vehicles also need less maintenance as compared to tracked ones. Armoured vehicles will provide much needed protection and mobility for the mainly infantry based Timor Leste army.<br><br>Somalia is one of the most chaotic and poorest country in the world. It will be irresponsible for Singapore as a member of the international community to fuel the violence in Somalia. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"></div>
