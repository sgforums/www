              <p>From <a href="http://www.officialwire.com/main.php?action=posted_news&amp;rid=7228">Official Wire:</a></p>
              <p><strong><em>Singapore’s defence spending will amount to US$11.4bn or
              6% of GDP in 2009. As a percentage of GDP, this amounts to one of the
              biggest defence budgets in recent history.</em></strong></p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Singapore has consistently had one of the largest <a href="http://www.companiesandmarkets.com/r.ashx?id=3DS8X8ZL582612">defence</a> budgets in the Asia Pacific region. </strong></span></span>Given its small population base,
              Singapore has focused on maintaining its expenditure on sophisticated
              and superior weaponry. Singapore has consistently spent over 4% of GDP
              on its defence budget. However, the principal recent development
              affecting the future of Singapore’s defence spending is the recent
              rapid deterioration in economic conditions.</p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Singapore was the first Asian economy to slip into recession in the
              current global downturn, and will move deeper into recession in 2009.</strong></span></span></p>
              <p>According to advance estimates by the Ministry of Trade and Industry
              (MTI), Singapore’s GDP registered a dismal seasonally-adjusted
              annualised contraction of 12.5% quarter-on-quarter (q-o-q) in Q408 (its
              worst performance since at least 1980), due to a sharp fall in the
              services sector. On a year-on-year (y-o-y) basis, GDP contracted by
              2.6%, implying that full-year growth for 2008 slowed to just 1.4% from
              7.7% in 2007. The manufacturing sector contracted by 9.0% y-o-y in
              Q408, due largely to falling demand for electronic products in
              developed markets and a plunge in output for precision engineering.</p>
              <p>Defence Minister Teo Chee Hean has announced that defence spending
              will amount to US$11.4bn or 6% of GDP in 2009. <span style="color: #ff0000;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>As a percentage of GDP,
              this amounts to one of the biggest defence budgets in recent history.</strong></span></span> The Defence Minister stressed the importance of maintaining military
              spending, <span style="color: #ff0000;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>noting that threats do not diminish but, rather, often emerge
              during testing economic times, owing to increased social and political
              frictions.</strong></span></span> He noted several factors that had enabled Singapore to build
              up its defence capability over time: careful spending, sourcing and
              upgrading second-hand equipment, an ongoing maintenance regime, and
              investment into research and development.</p>
              <p>In February 2009, the Singapore Armed Forces<span style="color: #ff0000;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong> (SAF) announced that
              they will participate in a US-led task force in the Gulf of Aden
              designed to target pirates operating in the Gulf and adjacent waterways.</strong></span></span></p>
              <p>Singapore will supply a landing ship tank, two helicopters and
              two-hundred personnel. Joining an international flotilla comprising
              some forty-five warships from Europe, China and Malaysia, the SAF
              deployment will help to escort vessels traversing the Arabian Sea,
              Indian Ocean, Red Sea and the Gulf.</p>

              <p>no need to worry.we wont go for Most Advanced,most powerful ,</p>
              <p>5 or 6 th G weapons or platforms,like Oz!!</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>1.Step bt step</strong></span></p>
              <p>For example,wil u drive a Lamborghini right after u get a driving license?</p>
              <p>Therefore,we get four 40 years old sub and upgrade them.</p>
              <p>Now we get two 20 years sub and EXTEND them into AIP!!</p>
              <p>For some platforms,u have to get a most updated one.</p>
              <p>Like in 1986,we spent one year of defense budget to buy 4 E2C AEW!!</p>
              <p>For Subs and MBT,we think old stuff can be upgraded to suit our needs</p>
              <p>with peanuts prices!!</p>

              <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>2.Intergration is the key</strong></span></p>
              <p>If u can intergrat off- the- shelf systems nicely,then u can get a very good</p>
              <p>sys value for Money!!</p>
              <p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">3.Home grown industries-----one stop services</span></strong></p>
              <p>Except few big platforms,we can produce almost all main defense</p>
              <p>gears in our small back yard.</p>
              <p>wat we cannot ,shall not try to make---</p>
              <p>subs(we cant copy people over 100 years experiences in few years time,</p>
              <p>like Oz try to do!!)</p>
              <p>5 G fighter</p>
              <p>big heli(we just do a small part of small heli currently)</p>
              <p>But we can make MBT,after lot of experience in ATTC,IFV etc)</p>
              <p>Few people aware we have few thousands guys involved in defense R &amp; D!!</p>
              <p>Also.ST Engineering is one of the biggest defence contractors in the world.</p>
              <p>So,u wont suprise when UK MOD award Bronco ATTC contracts</p>
              <p>to ST!!If not for national pride ,political and profits reasons,</p>
              <p>ST should have get more contracts.</p>
              <p>ST produce millions rounds of grenades!!</p>

              <p>Should you not be considered a "glutton" ?</p>
              <p>When all you have is just $800 a month ?</p>
              <p>Why do you want to justify your budget by being compared with the lifestyle in the consumption values of the Gill Bates, or Barren Wuffett or Oarrack Bomama - when their earning capacity outstrip yours 75 to 1 - (based on your numbers) ?</p>
              <p>When <strong>you depend</strong> on Gill Bates creativity for your monthly wages of $800 a month, must you struggle in trying to match his lifestyle ?</p>
              <p>His wealth is accumulated from servicing the global demands from all those who earn $800 a month - what do you do to accumulate your wealth from your meagre wage ?</p>
              <p>What will happen to your $800 a month wage if Gill Bates should suddenly have problems and cannot sustain the opportunities that allow you to exist ? </p>
              <p>While he has the reserve capacity to maintain your exaggeration of his lifestyle, can you afford to maintain yours, when your circumstance depend on his well-being ?</p>

              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Are you being real with the analogy used ?</p>
              <p>To begin with, the monthly loose change that Gill Bates received will exceed your $800 a month by more then 1000 to 1; and he will not be stupid to shorten his life by eating all the expensive artery clogging food that you have mentioned.</p>
              <p>In reality, the PAP Government will not want you to consume so much from your income that they determined for you, as they want more from you and your employer to "prepare" for your life after retirement.</p>
              <p>Why will the PAP Government want you to eat so much and live beyond 85 ?</p>
              <p>Seriously, how long can you survive on just $7 a day ?</p>
              <p>Is there $2 for "chye png" ? </p>
              <p>Are you going 100 percent vegetarian for 365 days through the year ?</p>
              <p>Drink from the tap at the toilet at 10 cents per entry ?</p>
              <p>Are you seriously taking LKY at his word when he guarantee that he will take care of the medical cost if anyone fall sick drinking from the tap in Singapore ?</p>
              <p>That is a brilliant way to take care of your medical cost by short-changing him.</p>

              <p><br>Why should it be a disgrace to buy A4 version of the Leopard ?</p>
              <p>At the end of the day, it is a platform to be sustained in a one-to-one combat with a potential adversary, or as a psychological deterrent to prevent the worst from happening - (achieving one of Sun Tzu's Principles).</p>
              <p>The second hand A4 can still be "dressed up" with all the fancy custom additions that one can dream up, and at a cost that is far lower than a fully equipped A6.</p>
              <p>More importantly, the A4 serve as a platform that open new opportunities for the SAF to learn new doctrines in armoured warfare that was not available with the AMX-13.</p>
              <p>It allow a new beginning for the SAF Armoured Corp in the same path that was taken to build the RSAF that Singapore has today.</p>

              <p>Our LeoA4s will be upgraded, but to what extent remains to be seen. The A4 purchase was a prudent decision - SAF got a good deal  and with upgrade it will be a good match against any modern MBT &amp; on paper the Malaysian PT91s are very formidable.    As always, the key is how good are the people operating the tank, individually and as a tank, platoon , company or batallion. </p>
              <p>But always remember that although money can buy the best hardware,  more critical are other factors such as fighting spirit etc. It is not necessarily  the better armed or equipped is victorious.</p>
