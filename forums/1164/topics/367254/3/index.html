              <p>One must remember the history of Singapore - how independence was forced on us in the midst of the turbulent politics that led to Singapore being thrown out of a rushed merger to be part of Malaysia.</p>
              <p>Prior to Singapore being forced out of Malaysia - there was a plan to send two battalions of Royal Malay Regiment to force a <em>coup de'tat</em> that would have locked up the entire Singapore State Government, put Singapore under the direct control of the Malaysian Federal Government.</p>
              <p>It was then UK PM Harold Wilson who prevented this from happening.</p>
              <p>This led to a frantic introduction of legislations to implement National Service based on the same lines as Israel, as she was the only country that responded to our call for help when others have declined.</p>
              <p>The amount spent on Defense has been gradually increased as the SAF mature in the step-by-step development - as seen in the purchase of second hand AMX-13 tanks that were first introduced, as well as the second hand Hawker Hunters fighter jets, the SkyHawks; then there were the old County Class LSTs, while new patrol boats were built locally.</p>
              <p>The size of the Defense Budget today is to ensure the SAF is kept on a sharp edge with all the modern equipment and technologies purchased, and also to ensure that the fighting capabilities are integrated to ensure the SAF is confident of the<em> 'force multiplier effects' </em>when different components are put together for any missions.</p>
              <p>The fact that the SAF need to train overseas is due to the limited land size that we inherited and live in.</p>
              <p>The bigger terrain made available overseas will allow the SAF to test the basic skills of individual soldiers training in unfamiliar ground, and which also allow larger SAF formations to familiarize and get experience in strategic manoevres - as well as to test new equipment, technologies and systems that are introduced to the make the SAF a sharp fighting force.</p>

              <p>As i wrote the money we spend on Rand D and manufacturing of some weapons should justify for a certain amount of money we can throw back and spend on our military trainings, hardware, people and whayever requires.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>In times like these when the economy is on the recovery or uncertainties as some may address it spending on military is a sign that reinforce that we take serious concerns on any monkey businesses.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>What you wrote why these are the usual expenses SAF incurr. Unless trainings has been cut down so say. I believe having a vision that a country (no matter how  big or small) is good to have some sort of defend force or army so as to deter any forms of foreign invasion will be in the minds of any sane ruler so the thought of building an army to defend the island is logical.</p>

              <p>after 20 yearsall the weapons would be obsolete and worth $0.probably end up all being sold by the kg like fish at fishmarket!</p>
              <p>they neeed far out weapons to keep with the times.reliable and cheap yet way ahead of the americans and europeans.You need research and development to produce the best.From  robot machinegunners that have machine vision ,robot snipers that kill an entire enemy platoon 100% ,supersubmarines built at keppel shipyard to house an entire helicopter squadron, flying robots with grenades thats able to fly like a plane as well and a bullet proof invisible force shield thats runned on a jet engine are amongst the few that can be made.</p>
              <p>i sincerely hope spore isnt using $$$ just to pay the generals high salary only and giving just enough to the rest.......</p>

              <p>Hitman, weapon is also based on technology. so i agree to what Atobe wrote. Yes its throwing money away if you view it in another angle but from engineering terms of a country's maintaiinance such expenses are inevvitable.</p>
              <p>In engineering terms a machine runs and some parts of it wear. we can employ lubricant to slow down the wear and repalce parts in times of wear. when the inductry demands and the machine's technology failes, that's where we see if its affordable economical to upgrade or srap for some cash abck prior to getting new technology, new machines.</p>

              <p>SO our tops look stupid. I hope they are as interested aif not zealous in their pursue for military knowledge and learn from histories and past technology. I also hope that what that can be disclosed are pure stupidity because we may have a system already in place suited for our island's defence.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>If you had even worked for the defecnce de[artment or any of their subsidiaries dealing with wepon, you will know that they buy newer weapon, understand their technolgy and rever engineer or modify its design in steps to suit our island's defend patterns.</p>

              <p>That's another topic. I am not interested in discussing remuneration of senior officers. But i hope in times of war they will not fear death and fight alongside all the men. Most soldiers who fought in WW2 or any other wars gets paid.</p>

              <p>fear death and fight alongside with their men???</p>
              <p>forget that wishful thinking!!!back in world war 2 when the Yamato battleship went on its last suicide mission......the general in charge stayed on some safe far away island then be on ship with his men!</p>
              <p>chinese sporeans arent japanese.think sporeans they would either surrender or escape from enemy or strike some deal with the enemy or werk with them pretending nothing has happened!</p>
              <p>u can already see in peace time where most of these generals are and how they function in parliament.so in war time....its the same thing too!</p>

              <p>Only countries without the technological knowhow or have a careless approach to maintaining effective systems  see their weapons deteriorate quickly and have to replace them in 20 years or in many cases much sooner. As can be seen, good weapons systems can be continuously upgraded to be effective. As I have mentioned before,  the SAF has many good examples of weapons still remaining relevant &amp; effective after more than 20 years of service such as the F5s, Oerlikon 35mm, AMX13, M113, V200 etc. The USA still uses 60 year old  B52s and many European countries still operate upgraded LeoA4s which were originally built 30 years ago.  </p>
              <p>Buying spare parts is key to maintaining an effective system - any system, not only weapons systems. Again one does not need to look far to see that shiny new equipment without spares or maintenance quickly become scrap metal.</p>
              <p>There is no such thing as building so called  "easy" weapons. Building a so called simple, for example , machinegun , rifle etc  to work reliably , be effective at reasonably cost is  probably one of the hardest things to do.  One of the most effective heavy machine guns today the Browing 50 cal was designed almost 100 years ago - now that is a techno marvel.  Even copying can be difficult - look at the M60 machinegun.</p>
              <p>Generals usually earned their stars very much earlier when they were fighting alongside their men in the frontlines of battle as junior officers &amp; performed very well. Thats why they usually have grey hair.  They shud not be spending too much time on the front lines but they shud be more critically  developing strategies / plans and executing them to ensure victory at minimum loss of own forces. Losing a general in the trenches to a sniper bullet may well mean victory for the enemy in the battlefield.  </p>

              <p>Remember the skinny 5 ' 4 " Vietcong with AK47s, pith helmets, black sandals ( made from old tyres ) carrying a bicycle inner tube of rice slung around the shoulder   ??   They  not only scared the hell out of the US troops, but beat them too.</p>
              <p>The typical Japanese infantryman of WW2 had probably the same physique as the Vietcong.  They too were much more than a match for the US Marines.</p>
              <p>Iraqi and Afghan insurgents have no more than basic hand held weapons to battle the US Army and Marines. The insurgents have yet to be beaten.</p>
              <p>Surely you cannot be awed by a muscle bound enemy. He is just a bigger target. A 6 ' 200 lb gorilla is as easily killed by a 5.56 mm round as a 5' 4" 120 lb Asian. What more if the Asian Army has a 1st rate air force,  modern artillery / armor / command &amp; control systems etc.  The outcome clearly cannot be certain for the gorilla.</p>
              <p>Its all in the mind &amp;  I see that you do not have the winning spirit.</p>
