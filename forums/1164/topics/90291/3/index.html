            <div class='col-md body'><br>Many years. Was participated in the 86SIR ATEC, which in turn was the 1st reservist unit got the taste. During the exercise, an Israeli advisor was followed through out all the way. RED force, who else is our red beret.<br><br>Red force does know the blue force where &amp; when coming but this is not the point as it should be part of the game. In short, blue force screw all the way up: -<br>Â·	Support PL force mary up point &amp; timing is arty register point &amp; same time as well. Kill by friendly force &amp; no heavy weapon support for block force.<br>Â·	Scout &amp; sniper all captured by Red force before the main body could move in. It so realistic that empire had to come in to prevent fighting between Red &amp; Blue force.<br>Â·	Main body attached objective without intelligent infro. How to pass?<br>Â·	CO talking cock thru the signal set to himself to stimulate sound battle situation.<br>Â·	Point Coy was cut off in between &amp; flanked by the Red force, OC was lost, donÂ’t know how to react!. Technically it should be totally wipe up.<br>Â·	Best part, donÂ’t know who the hell made such a decision, during movement contact contacted red force without access situation &amp; terrain, whole company react ambush drill charge BUT it is a very steep slope, walk also got problem, how to charge?<br><br>Lucky that not in infantry.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>hi people<br><br>i'm from 9th mono 3 SIR scout platoon, long time forum visitor, first time poster, lots of interesting topics to read. it has kept me busy during my free time.  currently studying overseas, so this has sort of comforted me when i was homesick. lots of memories too, when reading this thread, was a sgt in 3SIR, fresh from BSLC, we were with the company even b4 the main intake came in, there was no slack given to us from day one, for our jeep course we had to stay in camp for the duration, even though it was a stay out course, courtesy of our tough but always fair, and a bit nuts OC.<br><br>we had all the usual scout training except the Combat Survival Course, all thanks to our NDP commitment and the terrorist situation in America. it was really a team effort back in ATEC, from the corporals to our officer...with the exception of the S2...who i will not bad-mouth cos he cannot rebutt if i did....and thats not fair, those readers out there who are 9th mono scts will know.<br><br>as a platoon we all had our ups and downs, there were some times. i just didnt want to carry on anymore and i bitched about being a NS person with low pay and all that, but looking back, we did things and went places few would have gone, we suffered and were treated like dogs, but this was balanced by the cool things we did and saw (though 'cool' would probably be subjective here) and by the reputation we have earned from what we did in ATEC<br><br>so i wanna thank my platoon, and even those brothers from the other coys that took part in the ATEC, good job, great memories, that will be something that i will have to reminisce when old.<br><br>and its nice to know that the other present intakes of 3SIR are doing well!</div>
