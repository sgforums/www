              <p>Hi everyone, just a little background info of myself.</p>
              <p>I enlisted this May and did well enough in BMT to get into OCS. However, since young I have had this sharp pain in my tailbone every time pressure is applied onto it and it only got worse during NS. On my first bookout from OCS, I went to A&amp;E to get an x-ray done, and they referred me to for a specialist appointment. I postponed it because I had a field camp coming out and didn't want to miss it and risk being OOC-ed. However, due to unforeseen circumstances I OOC-ed in the end and went for the appointment, where my doctor gave me 4 months light duties and physiotherapy where he will then see me again to review. However, I got posted last week to 1SIR to be an Infantry Trooper (while on status).</p>
              <p>My problem right now is not so much of physical but it is more of mental. Ever since I OOC-ed, I have not been able to sleep well or eat well. Every night I average perhaps two to three hours of sleep, leaving me tired the entire day. But every time I close my eyes, I cannot help but think of the what-ifs and disappointment I have caused my loved ones. After being posted here, this anxiety has intensified because I am terrified of what may happen to me if I do not get out of here. Even though I am on light duty, I have to participate in most of the activities, and that has made my tailbone condition worse. Most of the time I am in a daze and I feel empty and numb at best. Other times, when my mind gets too muddled and the feelings overwhelms me too much, I start to break down and cry. I really tried to talk to people about this but all they say is to take your mind off it but I really can't. Others have started to say I'm trying to malinger. I flit between the helplessness of my situation and the worthlessness of having been kicked out of OCS. I have started cutting myself again as an outlet to release my pain but I have a genuine fear that I may be compelled to do even worse things if I do not get help soon. I tried surfacing the problem to the MO but he just dismissed it. As a last resort I have called the SAF Counselling Hotline to book a session but they told me it might take up to a month to have my appointment.</p>
              <p>I really cannot take it anymore and thus am trying to seek help from people here. I am paralysed by the fear of what may happen and I really need help soon. I do not dare speak to my PC and OC as events that happened in my army life has led me to distrust my commanders. I also don't dare seek an appointment with the MO to go to PCC because I have heard that the few people who have gone to my camp's MO have been sent to IMH and have yet to return. Anyone know how I may contact PCC (Psychological Care Centre) directly to make an appointment with a psychiatrist?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I really don't know how much more of this I can take anymore...  </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Somebody help me please.</p>

              <p>NS two years only. You have a long way ahead of you. Make good use of NS time to think about what you want to do in the future after ORD. I'm sure your family will understand your physical pain, take time to explain to them. </p>
              <p>I was in 1st CDO during my NS many years back. I trained a whole year with my mates and go through all the difficult times together. During a morning PT, i did sit up on the hard floor and when i sit up, i heard a loud crack. I lost energy and slammed to the ground. I could barely move. My mates help me to medical centre and MO say back strain. I was limping and in a lot of pain. It was training for ATEC period but i could not even get out of bed. Nobody understood my pain. On a weekend, i went to CGH A&amp;E and doctor took X-ray and immediately told me got slipped disc, internal bleeding and disc space reduce+degenration due to heavy loads. </p>
              <p>I went back to camp and people weren't happy. They start to say i keng. These were mates whom i trained with through CDO BMT, went Taiwan and did Airborne and all the long marches together. I was one alot of pain killers and was excused from training. But every morning parade was both mentally and physically painful. When officer asked who no well, i was always the one reporting sick. It took some time before i was officially downgraded. </p>
              <p>I filed an injury report to document it was service injury. The officers did not want to sign the document because they did not follow safety procedure to do sit up on mats. I told my parents and they threatened to get MP help, officers heard and wanted to charge me. I was damn down because i did my best to serve the nation and in the course of it got injured. But people treated me like trash because i was injured.</p>
              <p>I fully understand how u feel because i got transferred to the CDO HQ to be a clerk after that. I still saw my mates at the cook house and every evening when i book out, some are guarding the gates. They were envious. So they made rude comments about kenging and being weak etc. </p>
              <p>How i overcame it was by concentrating on my future. I applied for scholarship and got it. I took my free time outside came to practice on photography and did what i liked. I read extensively when i had free time in camp. I made a few good friends who weren't judgemental. I still did my administrative duties to my best.</p>
              <p>In the end i ORDed. 1 yr 10 mths went by quickly. I got outstanding for both conduct and performance. My CO and OC of the HQ wrote testimonial for me. </p>
              <p>Take the negative and channel that energy to do your best. </p>

              <p><em><strong>Being psychologically prepared is all about knowing
              what to expect and being prepared for it.</strong></em></p>
              <p>To be better prepared, you can participate in Total Defence
              activities and Open Houses organised by the SAF/SPF/SCDF.</p>
              <p>Perhaps you should also talk to your family members and friends
              who have lived the NS experience. The more you discuss with others,
              the more comfortable and mentally prepared you’ll become.</p>
              <p><strong>Because NS life is different from civilian life before
              enlistment, there are many adjustments you need to
              make.</strong></p>
              <p>A good way to cope is to get support from your buddy and fellow
              recruits. They are going through the same tough training as you, so
              talking to one another will help relieve some tension.</p>
              <p>In most evenings during your leisure time, you’ll also have some
              time to call your family or loved ones to talk. They can give you
              emotional support during NS.</p>
              <p>You can have a one-on-one interview sessions with your officer
              to highlight any problems you may have. If you have a personal or
              family problem that need to be addressed, do let the officer
              know—he may be able to give you some advice or time off to settle
              your problems.</p>
              <p>Life in NS revolves around structure, routine and discipline.
              This helps us stay united as a uniformed organisation as well as
              imparts the rigours necessary to protect our nation and
              citizens.</p>
              <p>This does not mean there is just work and no play. In fact,
              after a few weeks in NS and you’ll find new friends and new reasons
              to smile!</p>
              <p><strong>As a soldier, one of the biggest adjustments you’ll have
              to make quickly is in regimentation and discipline.</strong></p>
              <p>Being in a uniformed organisation, you’ll have to obey orders
              from your superiors. Thus some of you may feel a sudden lack of
              freedom to do what you want and you may find yourself having
              difficulties accepting authority initially.</p>
              <p>Regimentation and discipline build strong character and
              toughness, so that you’ll be tough enough to handle difficult
              combat, crime-fighting or rescue situations without giving up or
              breaking down.</p>
              <p>When you first enlist into NS, you may have concerns of being in
              a new territory, with new faces and new things to do. But don’t let
              this get to you. Just remember the saying that “when the going gets
              tough, the tough gets going”.</p>
              <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><em>Following are some
              tips on what you can do to prepare yourself
              psychologically:</em></span></p>
              <ul>
              <li>Adopt a positive perception</li>
              <li>Build up physical stamina</li>
              <li>Develop good working attitude and habits</li>
              <li>Overcome psychological stress</li>
              <li>Adopt teamwork spirit</li>
              <li>Learn to be independent</li>
              <li>Set realistic expectations</li>
              </ul>
              <p>You can also speak to your friends or family members who have
              been through NS. Ask them to share their stories. The sharing will
              help you reduce some of your fears, uncertainties and doubts.</p>
              <p><strong>During NS you’ll be living with different
              people.</strong></p>
              <p>Because these people come from different backgrounds, they may
              not think like you do or react to situations like you would.
              Instead of trying to select your type of people, you should cherish
              the diversity. This is a chance for you to learn more about your
              fellow mates and their cultures.</p>
              <p>You’ll find that you have many opportunities to absorb the
              different cultures—during training, eating, chatting or just seeing
              and listening. Take these opportunities and learn from people
              around you, you’ll have a much better appreciation of Singapore’s
              cultural diversity.</p>

              <p>The Institute of Mental Health (IMH) is a 2,000-bed acute
              tertiary psychiatric hospital situated on a 25-hectare
              campus at Buangkok Green Medical Park. Set amidst serene
              surroundings, IMH offers a comprehensive range of psychiatric,
              rehabilitative and counselling services for children, adolescents,
              adults, and the elderly.</p>
              <p>IMH’s tradition of care started in 1928. We were the first
              mental hospital in Singapore, starting with some 1,000 patients.
              Since then, many advances have been made in treatment, training,
              and research. Our treatment integrates evidence-based therapies,
              supported by the departments of clinical psychology, nursing,
              occupational therapy, and medical social work, to provide holistic
              care for our patients. IMH is equipped with modern facilities, with
              50 wards for inpatients and seven Specialist Outpatient
              Clinics.</p>
              <p>IMH was the first mental health institution in Asia to receive
              the Joint Commission International Accreditation in 2005, a highly
              coveted international accreditation for healthcare
              organisations. </p>
              <p>Over the years, IMH has gained a reputation for quality
              research. In 2008, the Ministry of Health,
              Singapore, entrusted IMH with a S$25 million research
              grant to implement translational and clinical research into the
              causes of schizophrenia and related psychotic disorders.</p>
              <p>IMH also plays a key role in training the next generation of
              mental health professionals in Singapore. We train psychiatrists
              and mental health professionals through the NHG-AHPL Residency
              Programme for psychiatry and through collaborations with the local
              tertiary institutions.</p>

              <h2>Helping servicemen serve</h2>
              </div>
              </div>
              <p>Story by Benita Teo</p>
              <p><strong>Serving in the military is certainly no mean feat. And
              when the security of the nation is in one’s hands, mental strength
              is as important as, if not more so than, physical
              fitness.</strong><br> <br> When the going gets tough, it is often helpful to talk it out with
              a trusted family or friend. But, even with the best of intentions,
              not everyone is able to fully comprehend the intricacies of
              military life.<br> <br> To help the servicemen and women of the Singapore Armed Forces
              (SAF) cope with the challenges of their military roles, the
              counsellors of the SAF Counselling Centre (SCC) are always ready to
              lend a listening ear. In fact, the team at SCC provides
              professional counselling services not only to all members of the
              Ministry of Defence (MINDEF) and SAF, but also to their
              families.<br> <br> <strong>Learning to live the military life</strong><br> <br> Unlike civilian counselling centres, the SCC comes under military
              mandate, and its primary purpose is to provide mental health care
              to ensure that servicemen are able to carry out their duties
              efficiently.<br> <br> Of the types of cases the SCC sees, Mrs Marlene Koh, Head of
              Education and Prevention Services, noted that the majority were
              Full-time National Servicemen (NSFs) with adaptation issues. "Not
              everybody is used to dealing with authority. They all came in as
              students who only had to take care of their own studies."<br> <br> She added: "The second, smaller group would be Regulars with career
              or family issues. A third group comprises families and soldiers
              affected by critical incidents that happened around them, for
              instance training incidents or a death in the family."<br> <br> Servicemen in distress may seek help directly with the SCC through
              two channels: face-to-face sessions or the 24-hour SAF Counselling
              Hotline. On top of these, a Family Support Helpline is also
              available for the family members of soldiers deployed overseas who
              are in need of assistance.<br> <br> <strong>Eyes and ears on the ground</strong><br> <br> To help junior and senior commanders to identify and assist men
              under their charge who are at risk of emotional distress, the SCC
              conducts regular workshops. In addition to basic counselling
              skills, stress management and suicide prevention are also taught at
              the workshops.<br> <br> Ms Cheryl Chia, an SCC counsellor with 14 years of experience,
              explained that equipping commanders with these skills is essential
              because "they are the eyes and ears on the ground".<br> <br> Another set of eyes that the SCC relies on to spot at-risk
              servicemen are the paracounsellors - Regulars who volunteer to help
              look after the mental welfare of servicemen at the unit level. To
              be appointed as paracounsellors, they have to go through a five-day
              course organised by the SCC that teaches basic counselling, suicide
              prevention and crisis management skills.<br> <br> Military Expert (ME) 3-3 Sulinder Singh, a Logistics Warrant
              Officer, has been a paracounsellor in his unit, 201 Squadron (SQN),
              since 2010. And being a familiar face in the unit means that
              servicemen know what to expect when they confide in him -
              trustworthiness.<br> <br> "I'm quite approachable, and they know that if they talk to me, it
              will be confidential."<br> <br> <strong>Allaying fears</strong><br> <br> Besides assuaging doubts over client confidentiality, the
              counsellors and paracounsellors also dispelled the stigma of
              seeking help.<br> <br> "(For) those who are in a position of command, it may be a 'face'
              issue," said SCC counsellor Lawrence Yap. "But so far, I've not
              encountered any clients (Regulars) who claimed that attending
              counselling affected their careers."<br> <br> ME3-3 Singh echoed his sentiments: "Is there a stigma attached to
              people in the unit who see paracounsellors? No, not at all. They
              are not mentally ill, we just need to help them find the right way
              to organise their thoughts."<br> <br> <strong>The counsellor is in</strong><br> <br> Help for a distressed soldier often begins with a visit to the
              Medical Officer (MO) with complaints of symptoms of stress. Said Ms
              Chia: "Usually they will say that they are unable to sleep or eat.
              When the MOs probe deeper and realise that the problem goes beyond
              a medical issue, they will refer them to us."<br> <br> At the SCC, the soldier will be assigned a counsellor. Through the
              sessions, counsellor and soldier will work together to identify the
              problems and set goals towards overcoming them. The counsellor will
              also impart skills such as stress or anger management
              techniques.<br> <br> When facing mental turmoil, a soldier may despair and lose his
              sense of self. One approach a counsellor may take is to remind him
              of his capabilities.<br> <br> "Counselling is about instilling a sense of hope," said Mr Yap, who
              specialises in substance and drug addiction counselling. "Everyone
              has it in them to overcome a difficult situation. We just need to
              help them see that they are not as helpless as they think they are,
              and that the situation is not as hopeless as they think it
              is."<br> <br> SCC counsellors also work with psychiatrists and psychologists from
              the Psychological Care Centre (PCC) at the SAF Medical Corps'
              Military Medicine Institute to provide all-round care to the
              soldier. PCC psychiatrists prescribe medication for conditions like
              depression while psychologists run tests to ascertain if a
              behavioural problem is linked to a learning or intellectual
              disability.<br> <br> <strong>Helping others help themselves</strong><br> <br> With the ever-evolving social landscape, counsellors must stay
              up-to-date on new behavioural problems or addictions, such as
              social media addiction.<br> <br> Mrs Koh also pointed out that there are now more cases of
              servicemen suffering anxieties about not performing well or meeting
              expectations, and that many expected others to solve their
              problems.<br> <br> Mr Yap agreed: "To change, clients have to take personal
              responsibility for their actions."<br> <br> Nonetheless, the counsellors take comfort in the knowledge that
              they are changing lives for the better.<br> <br> Mrs Koh remembered a recruit who had attempted suicide after his
              girlfriend of four years ended their relationship and started
              seeing a friend of his behind his back. Mrs Koh helped him
              acknowledge his feelings of hurt and disappointment, and taught him
              constructive ways of managing his anger.<br> <br> The recruit started to improve his relationship with his family and
              make new friends in his unit. Nine months later, he was finally
              able to move on from the break-up.<br> <br> Ms Chia also recounted a recent case: "I had a client who wanted to
              kill himself. But after working with his unit and the psychiatrist,
              just before his ORD (Operationally Ready Date) he said, 'You gave
              me hope. Even though life ahead will be challenging, at least I
              know now that there are people who care, and that there is more to
              life than thinking about hurting myself.'"<br> <br> She added: "He even baked us cupcakes as a 'thank you'. It's the
              little things like these (that let me know I’ve made a
              difference)."</p>
