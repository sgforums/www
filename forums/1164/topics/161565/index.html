            <div class='col-md body'><span style="color: red;">MiG-31 FOXHOUND (MIKOYAN-GUREVICH)</span><br><br>The most capable Russian air defense interceptor aircraft, the FOXHOUND has a multiple-target engagement capability and was the first Soviet fighter to have a true look-down, shoot-down capability. The key to the MiG-31's effectiveness is the SBI-16 Zaslon fixed phased array antenna radar, codenamed 'Flash Dance' by NATO, which is said to be the world's most powerful fighter radar. The new Soloviev D-30F6 engine was specified for the MiG-31 in order to improve range, the key performance parameter for which an improvement over the MiG-25 was demanded. By 1987 over 150 FOXHOUNDs were operationally deployed at several locations from the Arkhangelsk area in the northwestern USSR to the Soviet Far East. The FOXHOUND is dedicated to the homeland air defense mission. The FOXHOUND carries the long-range AA-9 air-to-air missiles, and can engage 4 different targets simuitaneouly with the M-9.<br><br>The wings of the aircraft are high-mounted and swept-back with square tips and a negative slant. There are four underwing pylons. There are two turbofan engines in the fuselage. There are rectangular and diagonal cut air intakes on sides of the fuselage. The exhausts extend beyond the tail plane. The fuselage is rectangular from the intakes to the exhausts and has a long, pointed nose. The aircraft has a bubble canopy. The tail fins are back-tapered with angular tips and canted outward. The flats are swept-back and tapered and mid- to low-mounted on the body.<br><br>In 1992 the Chinese reached agreement with the Russian Federation to buy 24 MiG-31 Foxhound long-range interceptors. The MiG-31s were expected to be assembled at a newly set-up factory in Shenyang, with production at a rate of four per month expected by 2000. The last aircraft was to be delivered by the year 2000. According to some reports the agreement included a license to build as many as 700 aircraft, and some projection envisioned that at least 200 would actually be deployed by the year 2010.<br><br>The first stage of tests of the upgraded MiG-31BM high-speed multifunctional long-range jet fighter were completed in mid-1999. The main difference between the MiG-31P (Foxhound, according to the NATO classification) and the new MiG-31BM multifunctional air strike system is that the latter is capable of destroying both air and ground targets. The designers and manufacturers of the MiG-31 hope that the new modification will result in international sales. The upgraded MiG-31BM is fitted with a powerful onboard computer system and a radar with a phased array which will allow the pilot to simultaneously activate the air-to-air and air-to-surface missile fire modes. When working with air targets, the MiG-31BM is capable of intercepting up to 24 targets simultaneously.<br><br>http://www.fas.org/nuke/guide/russia/airdef/mig-31.htm</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Very sorry regarding pics, tried every pic I could get my hands on and.........tatah! No pics! Well I will be converting them to URL form, so do be patient.<img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br><br>Do take note of the huge exhaust pipes.......I heard it is an American pilot's dream to see the MIG-25 or MIG-31 after-burner which can be quite spectacular!<img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"> Other modifications to take note would of course be the unusual 2 wheel bogeys which softens the Foxhound's foot-prints, allowing it to operate from unprepared runways. Standard feature on Soviet planes.<br>Other modificatons include more powerful and reliable engines allowing the Foxhound to travel at supersonic speeds at low altitudes. The MIG-25 engines do not work very well at low altitudes. Zaslon radar was also the first electronically scanned phased-array type to enter service, enabling MiG-31 to track 10 targets and engage four simultaneously, including targets below and behind its own location. Wing anhedral 4 degrees from roots; sweepback approx 40 degrees on leading-edge, 32 degrees at quarter-chord, with small sharply swept wingroot extensions; all-swept tail surfaces, with twin outward canted fins and dihedral horizontal surfaces. The aerodynamical modifications were done to eliminate the trim-up problem suffered by the MIG-25 which makes it aerodynamically inefficient.<br><br>Hehehe........the MIG-31 is a formidable interceptor all right. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"><br><br></div>
