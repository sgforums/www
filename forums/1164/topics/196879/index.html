            <div class='col-md body'>I have read articles and professional discussion about this afew years ago. Don't remember where...<br><br>EMP weapons while it works.. is however very short ranged. The Charged Capacitors themselves interferes with the most basic guiding systems of their delivery vehicles... meaning alot of work ahead.<br><br>Then there are the natural elements to the equation - AIR, trees, mountains, hills, buildings. However, the biggest problem is air.. don't recall the problem.. but it will limits the effectiveness of it... anything short of a nuke explosion... but hiroshima only records a few kilometres of effectiveness, unless the EM weapon can generate such a strength ... then maybe... We are talking about very very very large latent charge here. So if the EMP weapon is of a 2,000 lb iron bomb equivalent size.. it is only effective for a few metres from centre of sphere... a cruize missle would be more effective. However, if detonated on a power station, it will have a ripple effect on power distribution islandwide, but a Tomahawk would also have the same outcome...<br><br>However, the use of Silicon Diode(as I recall) will protect systems against this threat.. rendering it useless.. but developement cost is a factor... but not impossible. Silicon Diode itself is not complicated.<br><br>If it is truly effective, GWII would have seen it's use... and US would have secretly detonated one at the Iranian Nuclear Generation plant... if they are operating as claimed.<br><br>I might be wrong.. but this is what I had gathered... I'm not versed in this field.. so don't shoot a bullet into the back of my head..  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"></div>

Controlling the projectile is another concern. The ballistic flightpath of the rail gun's 'bullet' would propel it into space, making re-entry into Earth's atmosphere a survivability issue.<br><br>The round would be launched from the gun at a speed of M7.5 and speed at impact on a target 200 n miles away would be about M 5.0. Such speed and range are why some think of EM guns as ushering the next true revolution in weapon technology, with the capability to fire directly on enemy surface ships found within the horizon in six seconds and to fire indirectly on fixed and relocated targets up to 200 n miles away within six minutes.<br><br>210 of 586 words </blockquote></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>They did use EM weapons during GW2, but obviously it was not the kind of kill-all weapon we'd like to think of it as... but it was still useful. Basically a normal iron bomb rebuilt to use its explosion to power an EM pulse. Good for messing up electronics... but then again any electronics close enough to be destroyed by the EM would be destroyed by the blast of the bomb... but still it worked I think, to some extent on electronics out of the blast range...</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by MobyDog:</div><div class="quote_body">You know.. the talk of 3G being a milestone in warfare has it's limit... overly dependent on electronic.<br><br>You see, when I looked at all the gadgets and Portable handheld palmtops and laptops being used in the field.. It made me wonder how are they going to recharge and how many tons of batteries are they going to bring along in a sustain conflict. To be effective all those gadgets have to be switched on to be effective... and Boy.. do they consume power... how long could those notebook batteries last - 10 hrs.<br><br>If all those gadgets are out of batteries in the field.. they are just excess junk.<br><br>It's bad enough to to hunk arounf the PRC and all its's batteries.. but I find radio communication are the most important.<br><br>The way i see it.. the 3G concept is only suited for short conflict... till logistic problems creeps up with the supply of batteries. while it's a advantage is it's strategic HQ planning and execution of operations... but that's pretty common in modern military structures. What's so 3D about it. Put a palm top on every soldiers hands... once batteries out.. it's still the man with his rifle and radio.</div></blockquote>Yep,totally agree. All these electronic gizmo wizmo all require one form of charging station or other. They can't run on solar too...Its good to go 3G, but 3G also has it limitations. But since the communications being on of the key factors in war, it must be noted that perhaps everyone in the section will now be equipped with their personal comms. with a range of up to like 3km which is reasonable.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>SingaporeTyrannosaur,<br><br>Nobody is arguing that 3G is a load of worthless bull, but it's limitation on a sustain war. While all your points are mainly correct, mine is also valid.<br><br>Look at the IDF incursion in the Lebanese border, there are much more advance armed than we are.. but when it come right down to grunt action.. it is mainly still the man and rifles, supported by armour and air power, and of course his radio. Do you see them hugging their laptop and palm top in a gun fire ??<br><br>Those 3G gadgets are useful, but are more useful on special ops, FAC, recon and company style operations... which are usually short missions and away from actual combat... until batteries runs out that is..</div>
