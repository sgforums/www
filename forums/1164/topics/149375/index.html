            <div class='col-md body'>Just posting this up for info and to start some discussion.<br><br>Apparently the US Marines are going to start getting new-build UH-1Ys from next year. The UH-1Y is basically a twin-engined (same engines as SH-70B seahawk), stretched and marinised (e.g. can tahan seaspray into engine) Huey 'on steroids'. It's supposed to be able to fly further, lift more and is more survivable than the UH-1N which the Marines are currently using.<br><br>For example, the 4-blade rotors are supposed to be able to take a direct hit by a 23mm shell. Of course, your guess is as good as mine as to how many hits it can take...<br><br>It even has a funky helmet/ NGV, FLIR sighting system thingy!<br><br>I am not sure about cost, but they are supposed to be cheaper than the blackhawk, which is why the Marines wanted them. So, an appropriate replacement for our (now-retired) UH-1H?<br><br>Just in case anyone's interested, some interesting links are below:<br><br>Naval Technology page: <a href="http://www.naval-technology.com/projects/uh_1y/" rel="nofollow">http://www.naval-technology.com/projects/uh_1y/</a><br><br>Article on test Flight: <a href="http://www.aviationtoday.com/cgi/rw/show_mag.cgi?pub=rw&amp;mon=1003&amp;file=1003grandfathers_huey.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.aviationtoday.com/cgi/rw/show_mag.cgi?pub=rw&amp;mon=1003&amp;file=1003grandfathers_huey.htm</a><br><br><img src="http://i5.photobucket.com/albums/y158/hinklejd/0771.jpg"><br><br><img src="http://i5.photobucket.com/albums/y158/hinklejd/UH1Y_047612_580wide.jpg"><br><br><img src="http://i5.photobucket.com/albums/y158/hinklejd/DSC_0058.jpg">[/url]</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Actually there were quite a few variants that were designated, but either were produced in low numbers or weren't widely used due to the specific tasks the variant was made for. I have shamelessly ripped the following list of variants from the following site: <a href="http://www.vectorsite.net/avhuey.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.vectorsite.net/avhuey.html </a><br><br>The list is not really fully complete since it is not totally up to date, and does not include the UH-1Y and the AH-1Z. Note that the UH and the AH designations never crossed, e.g, no UH-1Q or W, but there was AH-1Q and W. I guess the AH-1 is counted as family. (there were also AH-1Q,R,S,T, i think) However, there was a UH-1U, if I am not mistaken...<br><br>Please note that 204 and 205 were both the original single-engine 'hueys', with the 205 being the stretched version. the UH-1H was from the 205 series. 212, 214 and 412 are twin-engined.<br><br><strong>Model 204 variants include: </strong><br><br>XH-40: Three initial prototypes, with Lycoming T53-L-1 engine (522 kW / 700 SHP) and teetering-bar rotor.<br><br>YH-40: Six evaluation rotorcraft, with T53-L-1A engine (574 kW / 770 SHP) and 30 centimeter (1 foot) fuselage stretch.<br><br>HU-1: Nine preproduction rotorcraft, similar to YH-40.<br><br>UH-1A (HU-1A): Initial full-production rotorcraft, similar to YH-40. 183 built.<br><br>UH-1B (HU-1B): Stretched variant with wider-span rotor.

Since the engines are the same as those on the UH-60, I would expect that they sound pretty the same, as they both have 4-blade rotors as well. Never really heard a Blackhawk tho, so can't really comment on the noise level.<br><br>I miss the 'whoop-whoop' noise of the old Hueys tho.

Since the engines are the same as those on the UH-60, I would expect that they sound pretty the same, as they both have 4-blade rotors as well. Never really heard a Blackhawk tho, so can't really comment on the noise level.<br><br>I miss the 'whoop-whoop' noise of the old Hueys tho. I live near one of the RSAF flightpaths and I grew up hearing the old hueys thumping by. You could always hear them coming!<br><br>Nowadays, I keep hearing the 'swishing' Chinooks instead....</div></blockquote>i think the "thup thup" sound was due more  because of the two blade rotors rather than the engines .....</div>
