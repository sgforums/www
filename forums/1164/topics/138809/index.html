            <div class='col-md body'><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">William Calley</span></strong><br><br>From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia.<br>William Calley (born June 8, 1943) was a U.S. Army officer involved in the March 1968 My Lai Massacre. He graduated from high school in Miami, Florida, and went to Palm Beach Jr. College in Lake Worth, Florida. He later became a conductor for the Florida East Coast Railroad before becoming a United States Army lieutenant in the Vietnam War.<br><br>Calley was charged on September 5, 1969 with six specifications of premeditated murder for the death of 109 Vietnamese civilians near the village of My Lai, at a hamlet called Song My, more commonly called My Lai in the U.S. press. In this well documented incident, 500 villagers, mostly women, children, infants and elderly, were assembled and then shot by soldiers of Charlie Company, Americal Division.<br><br>Calley's trial started on November 17, 1969 and resulted in a conviction on March 29, 1971 of premeditated murder of 22 civilians for his role in the massacre. On March 31, 1971 he was sentenced to life in prison.<br><br>Testimony revealed that <strong>Calley had ordered the men of Charlie Company, 1st Battalion, American Division to shoot everyone in the village. Calley claimed that he was following the orders of his immediate superior, Captain Ernest Medina</strong>. Whether or not this order was actually given is disputed; Medina was later acquitted of all charges relating to the incident at a separate trial. Of the 26 officers and soldiers initially charged for their participation in the My Lai massacre or the subsequent cover-up, only Calley was convicted.<br><br>Calley was seen by some as a scapegoat used by the U.S. Army instead of accepting responsibility for the failure to instill morale and discipline in its troops and commanders. Others, with lack of knowledge about his education or background, sought to excuse his actions because of his allegedly low intelligence and cultural background.<br><br>On April 1, only a day after Calley was sentenced, President Richard Nixon ordered him released from prison; in August 1971 his term was reduced to 20 years. Ultimately, Calley only served 3Â½ years of house arrest in his quarters at Fort Benning, Georgia and was released in 1974 by a federal judge. He is now a jeweler in Columbus, Georgia.<br><br><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Hugh Thompson</span></strong><br><br>Huge Thompson was a helicopter pilot during the Vietnam War. He is chiefly known for his role during the My Lai massacre, during which he was flying a reconnaissance mission.<br><br>Thompson, on seeing soldiers methodically killing civilians, landed his helicopter in between the soliders of Charlie Company and a bunker of Vietnamese non-combatants who were taking refuge in a bunker. Confronting the commanding officers of the company, he threatened to shoot anyone who opened fire on the surviving Vietnamese. Thompson then evacuated the remaining civlians by helicopter out of Son My.<br><br>Warrant Officer Thompson was trying to provide support for both US troops and to villagers. He believed that US troops were here to protect the civilians but upon witnessing several murders of civilians, Thompson and the crew realised what their own troops were doing. At this point, they stopped trusting the safety of the villagers to the ground troops, and proceeded to the evacuation with their own means and authority.<br><br>Thompson confronted the leaders of the troops. Several sources believe he would have been prepared to open fire on the US troopers if they did not let the helicopters proceed with the evacuation (Quote: He walked back to the <strong>aircraft. He said: "I'm going to go over and get them out of the bunker myself. If the squad opens up on them, shoot 'em." And he walked away Lawrence Colburn, [1] (http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/pacificnw/2002/0310/cover.html)), and covered the villagers with his own body.</strong><br><br>The crewmembers were credited with saving at least 11 lives, yet for long after they were reviled as traitors. Exactly thirty years later, the three were awarded the Soldier's Medal, the United States Army's highest award for bravery not involving direct contact with the enemy.<br><br>Everyone in the army , knows its an offense to disobey orders, so what are your view on thie crisis? It's amazing how 1 crisis , can have 1 hero and 1 zero..So what makes what's right and what's wrong in a war?<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>war is necessary but stupid.<br><br>Heroes are made according to the times. If the global wind is blowing in the direction of compassion, compassion will be appreciated.<br><br>You can say that if you were given an order by a superior officer to kill someone you think is innocent, you wont ever do it. But when you are in a war, everything is grey. Your friends are dying. You are being shot at. Nothing is as concrete as what it seems.<br><br>Alot of the viet war vets had PTSD and acted irrationally upon returning home. I believe most of these people were reacting to the orders they followed previously in the war.<br><br>So i guess it boils down to how much your survival means to you, is it worth the expense of your sanity?</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Gradually the furor died down. Colburn and Thompson lived in relative anonymity until a 1989 television documentary on My Lai reclaimed them as forgotten heroes. David Egan, a Clemson University professor who had served in a French village where Nazis killed scores of innocents in World War II, was amazed by the story. He campaigned to have Thompson and his team awarded the coveted Soldier's Medal. It wasn't until March 6, 1998, after internal debate among Pentagon officials (who feared an award would reopen old wounds) and outside pressure from reporters, that Thompson and Colburn finally received medals in a ceremony at the Vietnam Veterans Memorial.<br><br>But both say a far more gratifying reward was a trip back to My Lai this March to dedicate a school and a "peace park." It was then they finally met a young <strong>man named Do Hoa, who they believe was the boy they rescued from that death-filled ditch. "Being reunited with the boy was just...I can't even describe it," says Colburn. And Thompson, also overwhelmed, doesn't even try. </strong><br><br>On that historic morning, Thompson set his helicopter down near the irrigation ditch full of bodies. He asked a sergeant if the soldiers could help the civilians, some of whom were still moving. The sergeant suggested putting them out of their misery. <strong>Stunned, Thompson turned to Lieutenant Calley, who told him to mind his own business. Thompson reluctantly got back in his helicopter and began to lift off. Just then Andreotta yelled, "My God, they're firing into the ditch!" </strong><br><br>WO vs LT..<br><br>LESSONS FROM MY LAI ON DRAWING THE LINE<br><a href="http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/pacificnw/2002/0310/cover.html" rel="nofollow">http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/pacificnw/2002/0310/cover.html</a><br><br>This is what something every soldier should know.</div>
