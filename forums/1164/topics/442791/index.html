              As the title said, what do people think of collaboration projects with the Chinese? I admit, doing business with their businessmen is something that should be done carefully, but their weapons project are still under military control, so less "greedy". They do have some nice stuff that we can use, and at the same time, they also have several deficient areas that they can use help on.
              
              Places where we can help:
              
              1)Aircraft engines-They're still dependent on Russia for these, no local production.
              2)ATGMs- We can see if Israel's willing to let the co-designed Spike out if they can get something in return.
              3)Light strike/light tank heliborne/airlift capable vehicles
              
              Pity they upgraded the QBB-95 or we could have rechambered a 5.8 Ultimax for them.
              
              What we might get from them:
              
              1)Stealth tech for planes (J-20). Still using Soviet engines, which I bet they're really "happy" about.
              2)Modernized cruise missiles. They have a lack of new missiles too, same problem as aircraft engines, which hinder them and we need something newer than Harpoons, which are honestly getting long in the tooth.
              
              A successful collaboration will also help open the Chinese market to us, and it is a HUGE market, the US has too much NIH syndrome/red tape to be a good buyer, and it'll improve our diplomatic relations with them.
              
              OTOH, Taiwan and the US will freak out.:P

              Milo, it's only a matter of time before they develop their own stuff, might as well make use of the short time window to "help" them along and get some profit out of it. 
              
              They develop it themselves, we got no diplomatic credit or tech transfer or sales to them, we help them we can get at least something back. Look at stealth tech, 1st America had it, no sales to anyone. Now Russia and China have it, can't sell to them even if they wanted to. Same with the rest of the stuff, they'll get it sooner or later so might as well make profit off them for now, in cash or tech.
              
              Susan, why do you even bother posting....
              
              BTW the US owns us, Jews own the US, so does that mean Israel owns Singapore? :P
              
              And "she" thinks very small. Harass tankers? hah, board them, kill everyone, sell the cargo and ship- PAP earns millions of dollars and can say the evil pirates did it.
              
              But as always, Susan's the small time conspiracy theorist, only thinks small.

              I fail to see the relevance Dal.
              
              Milo, exactly. It's a very serious commitment, all or nothing. I do see some good that can come out of cooperation, but it needs to be really deep, not just superficial.
              
              As for collaboration with India, I won't mind having an "in" on the Brahmos 2 project :)
              
              weasel, I said work with them, not smack them in the face. :P There are still areas where they are short, their "Spike equivalent" is the Chinese copy of the Sagger, very old ATGM, and they havn't really developed the concept of airmobile yet which could be helpful to them considering the size of their country and lack of superhighways. They're also dependent on air engine imports from Russia, their main production bottleneck.
              
              As for Singapore suppliers, some stuff they just don't let out. If we can't get F-22s, why not J-20s? Most people won't simply sell their stealth fighters, so we need some "pull" to encourage sales, hence the idea of collaboration (i.e we scratch your back, you scratch ours). Don't tell me Singapore's defences won't be greatly improved with stealth tech?

              <p>Missiles are another consideration. The J-20 can be a better aircraft but ultimately, a fighter will need to shoot down the opposing aircraft.

              <p>Even the older F-15s has advanced sniper pods (besides AESA radars) that can detect and track stealth aircraft at range using non-radar techniques. The F-35 brings that one step further with internal sensor fusion. Do the Chinese have access to that technology?</p>

              weasel, I'll believe in the F-35 when the 1st one is offered for sale. The way the American economy is going and with all the cuts and cost overruns, the Lightning II project is going to be difficult to bring to completion unless someone ante's up. Look at the F-22, all lines totally closed down, you think they'll accept building a totally new type of stealth fighter when they can't even maintain their pride and joy? China isn't in that bad a boat. And the F-35 is a holdover from the Cold War info containment times, i.e the modern sucessor to the F-5, go wiki up the F-5 development theory for the logic behind it, but long story short, it's a cheapo F-22 using only tech the US won't mind losing, not their top end stuff. That being said, we won't know how reliable the F-35 is going to be too, considering that it's still in the testing stage, same as the J-20. For all we know, both might turn out to be lemons (B-2 maintainance? Ouch).
              
              But your point on equipment compatability is a good point, AESA is a serious piece of equipment that needs to be intergrated, and parts compatability is a fairly serious issue which needs to be surmounted (STANAG anyone? :P) though the "dodgy IFF" thing sounds like excuse making. As far as I know, the only countries that have shot up airliners are, ironically, the US, Russia and Israel. (A Ticonderoga class's radar read the military ID off a C-130 and accidentally assigned it to the Iranian airliner IAF655, and KAL Flight 007 which strayed into Soviet airspace.) So the US isn't squeeky clean on dodgy IFFs too.
              
              BTW, the modern way to detect stealth nowadays is to use low frequency X-band for detection, FLIR is visual range only. And AESA is perfect for anti-stealth work due to it's multiple emitters.
              
              alise, I thought of that too, but the Russians need even less from us than the Chinese :( Unless they accept pure cash, and there is also the traditional equipment incompatability and reliability issues weasel brought up. To counter that, we would have to get into any project at the design stage or come up with a plans conversion and build it (ourselves?).
              
              One of the things that have impressed some US observers about the SAF is that we really don't care where the stuff comes from (French frigates operating American helos) as long as we can use it and it's good. Despite the US State Department getting heart attacks, I actually believe that the continuation of this policy into what may be seen as "enemy tech" may contribute to a good impression at the laymen levels.
              
              Provided we don't end up buying lemons... :P

              It really would be unfortunate, but I honestly cannot trust that the program is a done deal. I agree the will is there, but the cash may not be, and the major partners are all suffering from a recession right now. Most likely scenario, the 1st production run will only start after the US economy picks up. I estimate ~2018+. A long time to wait on a maybe.
              
              And I really question the role of the F-35. It's range and payload's more suitable to an interceptor than a strike fighter, it's a bit short legged and only 4 missiles in internal bays. Yes, they made a lot of noise about the external hardpoints, but the more you hang off them, the more detectable you are. Radar picks up the return from the missiles. So interceptor, yes. Air superiority, maybe. :( So you are right in more ways than one to compare it to the F-16.
              
              On the other hand,'I've never been fond of the F-35, seeing it as the chopped down export version of the F-22. Why settle for less when you can try to get a fully fledged stealth strike fighter?

              <p>There's already 97 F-35s ordered under the LRIP. That doesn't count the Israeli and Australia (14) orders which have been made.</p>
              <p>The F-35A minus tanks will have the same range as the F-16C/D with tanks and way more than previous fighters eg F-5s. The RSAF F-16C/D &amp; F-5s have been used as a strike fighter. If the F-35A doesn't have enough range, the past &amp; existing Singapore Air Force has a big issue.</p>
              <p>As to Alize's qn on how the Indians do it. That's the problem. They went ahead with the Su-30 and ended up with low serviceability rates in really inane issues like tyre shortage. That's why the 126 plane MRCA order will end up with French or EU. The 5th gen Pak-FA programme is really high risk from that perspective. No reason why it can't end up like the LCA that's going to be way obsolete by the time its fully inducted.</p>
              <p>I like the S-300. I read somewhere that Singapore took a long hard look at that (together with the Patriot). I can understand why its not inducted. The US will never allow a Russian system used by the Chinese to have access to US-based IFF codes which I think SG uses. Its different with an igla directed by ground/AEW control that already does IFF. Too much friendly fire risk with a 100-200km ranged missile. Patriot too ex so we still have I-hawk.</p>

              weasel, they ordered it. Any idea when they are going to "receive" it? My estimate is 2018-2020. As I already mentioned also, we don't really know the capabilities/liabilities of the F-35 too.
              
              As for the comparison with the F-5 and F-16, you do realise those 2 are interceptors in concept? It's not only the range, but also the payload, interceptors tend to have a higher payload vs total mass and lower number of weapons per fighter too. The PvM affects range and performance. And yes I'm also worried about the payload on the F-16s too, though I do understand it's due to Singapore's need to multi-role. (2 bombs for the F-16. 4 max... well... maybe 6 if you really squeezed the pylons and want to take a performance penalty).
              
              And I do agree, pity on the S-300, though my suspicions are that IFF is not really the main concern, any proper radar should already come with the ability to do target identification and tracking as a stand-alone, not an add-on, unless it's a civillian search radar, I'm not sure about those.

              The first production F-35A has already been delivered (and some of the lot 2 as well). Normally 2 years from contract. Lot 5 contract just got issued a couple of days back.
              
              http://www.aviationweek.com/aw/blogs/defense/index.jsp?plckController=Blog&amp;plckBlogPage=BlogViewPost&amp;newspaperUserId=27ec4a53-dcc8-42d0-bd3a-01329aef79a7&amp;plckPostId=Blog:27ec4a53-dcc8-42d0-bd3a-01329aef79a7Post:d13182c0-eb51-41ec-a502-b73a7a83bf6c&amp;plckScript=blogScript&amp;plckElementId=blogDest
              
              The thing is that low rate production (LRIP) aircraft are not fully combat capable. It was meant to be retrofitted as technology are signed off. That's why the new chief of the programme was complaining over concurrency issues recently ie that it cost too much to retrofit.
              
              LRIP will cover over 8-9 batches. Thereafter it will be a MYP or multi-year programme which will attain a fully combat capable block. That's when most countries will await to buy. Those that signed up to the original F-35 partnership programme are allowed to buy LRIP aircraft. That includes the lowest level participants (SCP) which comprises both Israel and Singapore. Israel chose to buy LRIP aircraft and is targeted to receive their in 2016 though they are worried it will be delayed. LRIP aircraft are also more expensive.
              
              Singapore maintains an SCP office in Washington just for this programme.
              
              As for the F-5/F-16, I agree in part. However, Singapore chose esp for the F-5E to turn it into a strike fighter, whereas F-16 was originally designed as such. The F-5E can carry the centreline MER (multiple ejector rack) that can afford 6x 500b Mk-82s or possibly JDAMs. The A-4s carry the MER as well. That's besides the 2 weapons pylons which are Maverick-capable.
              
              The F-16 normally carries 2 tanks with 2 weapons pylon + 2 wingtip amraams/aim-9s. With CFT, its actually sufficient range to strike within Peninsular malaysia with 4 weapons pylons and no wing-tanks. The RSAF operates it with TER (triple ejector racks). With 2 pylons, that carries 6x mk-82s, JDAMs or the new Laser JDAMs. The LJDAMs are really a step up in capability. Unfortunately, its only 2x GBU-12 paveways per TER due to clearance issues. Its more than enough considering targeting issues. The F-16 was originally designed for single target alpha strikes per pass, though it can make more than 1 pass per mission. The F-15s on the other hand is now capable of multiple PGM target strikes per pass. That's a scary capability to take out 12+ targets in just 1 pass.
              
              The S-300 can do IFF. However, whether it can pick up IFF signals from NATO-based IFF transponders is another issue.

              What A-4s...
              
              If there was a choice between using the F-5 or the F-16 for a bombing run, I'd agree, the F-16 is the better choice, the F-5 truly is a terrible choice for a bombing run. I also suspect the choice to make the F-16 the bomber of the RSAF instead of the F-15 is probably that 1) The F-15 might be more valuable in the air-superiority role and 2) The high thrust to weight ratio of an "interceptor" would allow the aircraft to return to normal flight faster than a heavier fighter as well as being more agile. (Actually, I think the F-15's T/W ratio is better, but it's probably more needed in overwatch.)
              
              Nice to know the F-35 is FINALLY being delivered, even if it's the lego form, but still doesn't make me a fan, let's be honest, Washington and Congress has a cap on how stealthy they allow a plane for export, and it's this cap that really turns me off and one of the reasons I'm avocating other sources. If your supplier deliberately handicaps your product from being the best, it may be time to go around, under, or over the wall instead of through it. Not just China, if the Russians can give us a good product, why not? (Though maintainance issues and compatibility that weasel mentioned are a factor too, though compatibility can be solved with software redevelopment/adaptors.)

              <p>As to Alize's qn on how the Indians do it. That's the problem.
              They went ahead with the Su-30 and ended up with low serviceability
              rates in really inane issues like tyre shortage. That's why the 126
              plane MRCA order will end up with French or EU. The 5th gen
              Pak-FA programme is really high risk from that perspective. No
              reason why it can't end up like the LCA that's going to be way
              obsolete by the time its fully inducted.</p>
              <p>I like the S-300. I read somewhere that Singapore took a long
              hard look at that (together with the Patriot). I can understand why
              its not inducted. The US will never allow a Russian system used by
              the Chinese to have access to US-based IFF codes which I think SG
              uses. Its different with an igla directed by ground/AEW control
              that already does IFF. Too much friendly fire risk with a 100-200km
              ranged missile. Patriot too ex so we still have I-hawk.</p>

              <p>Is our Igla's cueing radar of Western origin? I don't know of any other country that provides a radar for their Iglas.</p>
              <p>Underpaid, the F-35 is really more comparable to the F-16 than the F-5. The F-5 was a cheap fighter to be given away as foreign aid and was never used by the USAF except for evaluation in Vietnam. The F-20 and F-16/79 were intended as its successor in the 1970s, since President Carter originally did not clear the F-16A for export. They would have come to reality in the event F-16s were not cleared for export by the Reagan administration. </p>
