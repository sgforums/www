            <div class='col-md body'>This case is indeed peculiar.<br><br>If the accused cannot give any reason why he committed the murder then it seems he is psycologically unsound and has an unsound mind.<br><br>Coming to think of it is was highly unbelievable about what he told the police that he slept through the murder! Anyone with a sensible mind would find that statement highly suspicious.<br><br>It is also in a way queer that someone especially an infantry officer in the SAF should act this way. An officer is supposed to be someone with integrity and good conduct. It will be interesting to know and find out why he murdered his faltmates. Quite a scary story actually.<br><br></div>
