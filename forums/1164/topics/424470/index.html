              <p>I heard recently there are calls for Singapore to reduce the Defence budget. Once such move do happen, it will be the sign of weakness!</p>
              <p><a href="http://militarynuts.com/index.php?showtopic=3206">http://militarynuts.com/index.php?showtopic=3206</a></p>
              <p>Maintaining our Defence budget at 5% of GDP is a good model and should be continued.</p>
              <p>Looking at China, "China’s defence budget to rise 12.7 percent, 2011"</p>
              <p>China announced a double-digit increase in its secretive military budget yesterday but insisted the annual outlay of more than USD 90 billion posed no external threat, despite concern worldwide.</p>
              <p>The defence budget will rise 12.7 percent in 2011 to 601.1 billion yuan (USD 91.7 billion), according to Li Zhaoxing, spokesman of the national parliament and a former foreign minister.</p>
              <p>He said the figure was contained in a budgetary report submitted by the Communist Party to the National People’s Congress, which opens its annual 10-day session today.</p>
              <p>“China has always paid attention to controlling the size of defence spending,” Li told reporters, describing spending as “relatively low” compared with the rest of the world.<br>Li, a former foreign minister, said the figure represented six percent of the total national budget in the world’s second-largest economy.</p>
              <p>The number however represents a return to double-digit increases, which have alarmed the United States and several of China’s Asian neighbours. That trend had been broken last year when the defence budget rose 7.5 percent.</p>
              <p>The People’s Liberation Army - the world’s largest - is hugely secretive about its defence programmes, but insists its modernisation is purely defensive in nature.<br>“This will not pose a threat to any country,” Li said.</p>
              <p>For Willy Lam, a China analyst at the Chinese University of Hong Kong, the published military budget - which he said was likely only one-third to one-half of total spending - will be poured into next-generation equipment.</p>
              <p>“The return to this double-digit PLA budget reflects the growing power of the PLA,” Lam told AFP. “They are trying to close the gap with Russia and the United States.”<br>Experts say the spending hike also reflects a desire to keep the pressure on Washington, Tokyo and others in the region.</p>
              <p>“The Chinese communist leadership needs to increase its military intimidation of the United States, Taiwan and neighbours like Japan and India,” said Rick Fisher at the International Assessment and Strategy Centre in the US.</p>
              <p>“Spending increases advance this goal by ensuring that programmes entering their expensive procurement phase, like aircraft carriers and nuclear missile submarines, can proceed without delay,” Fisher told AFP.</p>
              <p>While Singapore's Defence Budget - "Singapore raises defense budget by 5.4% for 2011"<br><br><span style="color: #333333;">Singapore, which has one of Asia's best-equipped militaries and ranks high internationally in per capita defense spending, raised its national defence budget by 5.4 percent, government data showed Friday. </span></p>
              <div class="ad-left"><span class="HeadLineNewsContent1">For the fiscal year 2011 starting on April 1, the government allocated SG$12.08 billion (US$9.5 billion) to defense, up from SG$11.46 billion a year earlier, according to the 2011 budget presented by the Ministry of Finance. </span></div>
              <div class="ad-left"><span class="HeadLineNewsContent1"></span></div>
              <p>
              </p><p>In a recent interview, state founder Lee Kuan Yew justified the Singapore's defense spending.</p>
              <p>Lee said the island state with its population of 5 million people had to spend 5 to 6 percent of its gross domestic product on defense to resist any possible pressures from larger neighbors Indonesia and Malaysia.</p>
              <p>“Without a strong defense, there will be no Singapore,” Lee said.</p>

              <p>Its a big risk to spend just for the sake of spending. UK has the 3rd largest defence budget in the world and in a few years will have a navy and air force smaller than Turkey with less stealth a/c. Spent $8+ BILLION on a MRA-4 aircraft and finally had zero-aircraft which ended up scrapped.</p>
              <p>If Singapore spent $8 BILLION on nothing, it will have no deterrence.</p>
              <p>The key is not just more spending but efficient spending. That means constantly re-examining sacred cows for effectiveness eg NS, big ticket purchases. Procurement needs to be transparent. Any leakages need to be plugged.</p>
              <p>Lucky for SG, the current Government has had very many multi-$$$$$$$$$ projects which have been very well executed.</p>
              <p>That includes:</p>
              <p>(a) Formidable frigate - lower personnel to run same sized ships. Made in Singapore some more...</p>
              <p>(b) F-15SG - highly effective 3rd gen a/c that unlike its other competitors can still be relevant into the next gen.</p>
              <p>(c) G-550 replacement - introduced with minimal risk and cost unlike the highly problematic RAAF AEW program which was delayed with massive cost-overrun. They started their procurement earlier but we got ours earlier.</p>
              <p>(d) S-70 helicopters. Australia had the massive S-2G cancellation again due to cost-overrun and manufacturing issues.</p>
              <p>Other very cost-effective programmes with cheap 2nd hand capabilities include</p>
              <p>(i) Submarines - 2nd hand hulls but upgraded with 1st hand weapons/electronics</p>
              <p>(ii) Leopard 2 tanks - 2nd hand use but upgraded with 1st hand weapons/armour</p>
              <p>(iii) KC-135s - cheap 2nd hand tankers</p>
              <p>A lot of other examples. Some very cheap programmes but highly effective eg ACMS. All with a specific role that is highly calculated to meet specific and clear defence needs.</p>

              <p>For countries with professional armed forces a sizable proportion  of the budget goes to the pay and welfare of the soldiers.</p>
              <p>Also, some countries allocate  significant amount of budget to maintenance and training while others do not.</p>
              <p>Some buy shiny new equipment which look good on the parade square , in the dockyard or on the runway. So just looking at the absolute numbers is deceiving.  </p>
              <p>For Singaporeans who have served NS, I think we will all agree that defence is a key consideration for Singapore's survival. Easy for big countries to criticise that we spend too much on defence. But one day when we are suddenlty threatened by a rogue  nation or tyrant, you will be very glad that you have the F15SG , Formidable frigate, Archer submarine, Spyder SAM, Leo2, HIMARS etc and finally our NSman standing his ground with a SAR21A. Then you have more options.</p>

              <p>There are a few resellers in Singapore but no other arms manufacturing company that I'm aware of. On the other hand, there are many contractors supplying to the SAF. More prominent is the food industry eg SFI. SFI is a subsidiary of SATs which is 45% owned by Temasek (and thus 55% public owned.)</p>

              <p>read my post carefully, "we don't want to have the rich to dictate how we should spend our money just because they paid higher tax."</p>
              <p>The cabinet, voted in by the majority of Singaporean, decide on the budget, after debating in the parliament. The respective ministry will decide how to allocate the money in details, how to spend, where to spend....these are civil servants paid to do the job, not the tax payers, no matter how much tax you pay.</p>
              <p>Having said all that, those who pay high taxes surely can raise their voice louder than than those who pay little or don't pay at all. That's life mate!!</p>
