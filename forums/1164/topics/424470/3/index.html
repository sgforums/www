              <p>ICE, those two topics may not be totally unlinked, not like save either family or country, sometimes the best way to defend your family is through banding in a bigger group. After all, if country X invades and you try to protect your family solo, you'll be like kitchen chopper vs M-16. At least grouped in an army, you at least got an AR and arty and air support. Much more effective. And it's this "bigger group" that people call a "country", so you protect your family, and other families, in return, their guys also protect yours. Country is more than PAP. PAP cannot live without a country, a country can live without PAP, though it might be much tougher for a while.</p>

              <p>Cutting the NS term further is not practical for the more
                      complicated specializations, if you are just a plain infantryman,
                      you probably learnt everything in the 1st 6-9 months, but for
                      sergents and LTs, their training term is MUCH longer and they need
                      hands on practice as well, otherwise you'll have officers who
                      finish NS only 3 months after posting to a unit.</p>
              <p>(3 months BMT, maybe 3 months SISPEC for the SISPEC intake, 9
                      months training term = 15 months) This is excluding the
                      conversion courses to specialise, so total is ~18 months. If we
                      reduced it to 15-18 months, the officer will graduate and go into
                      the NSman pool without ever having been posted to a unit.
                      NOT someone I'd have confidence passing me orders. To be really
                      honest, the 6 months for being posted to a unit now is,
                      opinion-wise, on the borderline of short, at least with 2 1/2
                      years, he would have had 1 year to get up to speed. Now, it's only
                      6 months of working experience. Almost like touch and go.</p>
              <p>Some things you just HAVE to hands on practice, theory is just
                      that. Theory.</p>

              <p>Dont forget that S Korea is facing a real threat from N Korea althought I am personally not so sure abut the seriousness of  China's threat to Taiwan is really that serious. So the duration of conscription of at least 24 months is appropriate for these countries. Israel also has long conscription time as it is being threatened constantly &amp; already has a long history of war with its neighbors - so long conscription is no surprise.</p>
              <p>For other countries such as Switzerand and Germany where threat is minimal or next to non existent especially when the threat fo the former Warsaw pact is no longer around, no surprise again that conscription is shorter or now shortened.</p>
              <p>Again, as also pointed out by others, to be effective and competent one really needs to have the time to be trained and exercised to ensure competency and effectiveness. 12 to 15 months is just too short.</p>
              <p>Also, to maintain the numbers of available combat units, one needs NS to be of longer duration. Too few combat units also  make for   ineffective combat power.</p>

              <p>Compared to Asian countries (South Korea 24 months, Singapore 20 months, Taiwan formerly 24 but now 12 months), and former communist bloc countries (18 months to 2 years, in Russia's case 3 years).</p>
              <p>Looking at the facts, notice Asian countries have long NS periods, perhaps due to cultural factors like kiasuism and insecurity.</p>
              <p>Also in cases where leaders remain in power for a long time, they have vested interests in making NS long to secure their stay in power (South Korea and Taiwan were not democratic until recently).</p>

              <p>I see a trend towards small professional armed forces and conscription either being abolished or being very short in duration.</p>
              <p>But again we have to face the unfortunate fact that we are just too small in terms of both manpower and land area do away with NS.   </p>
              <p>But even NS officers and men both need that 18 to 24 months to be fully proficient in the weapons, operational procedures and tactics for the gamut of exercises needed from section to battalion &amp; right up to at least brigade level to be effective. </p>

              <p>Its a big risk to spend just for the sake of spending. UK has
              the 3rd largest defence budget in the world and in a few years will
              have a navy and air force smaller than Turkey with less stealth
              a/c. Spent $8+ BILLION on a MRA-4 aircraft and finally had
              zero-aircraft which ended up scrapped.</p>
              <p>If Singapore spent $8 BILLION on nothing, it will have no
              deterrence.</p>
              <p>The key is not just more spending but efficient spending.
              That means constantly re-examining sacred cows for effectiveness eg
              NS, big ticket purchases. Procurement needs to be transparent. Any
              leakages need to be plugged.</p>
              <p>Lucky for SG, the current Government has had very many
              multi-$$$$$$$$$ projects which have been very well executed.</p>
              <p>That includes:</p>
              <p>(a) Formidable frigate - lower personnel to run same sized
              ships. Made in Singapore some more...</p>
              <p>(b) F-15SG - highly effective 3rd gen a/c that unlike its
              other competitors can still be relevant into the next gen.</p>
              <p>(c) G-550 replacement - introduced with minimal risk and cost
              unlike the highly problematic RAAF AEW program which was delayed
              with massive cost-overrun. They started their procurement earlier
              but we got ours earlier.</p>
              <p>(d) S-70 helicopters. Australia had the massive S-2G
              cancellation again due to cost-overrun and manufacturing
              issues.</p>
              <p>Other very cost-effective programmes with cheap 2nd hand
              capabilities include</p>
              <p>(i) Submarines - 2nd hand hulls but upgraded with 1st hand
              weapons/electronics</p>
              <p>(ii) Leopard 2 tanks - 2nd hand use but upgraded with 1st hand
              weapons/armour</p>
              <p>(iii) KC-135s - cheap 2nd hand tankers</p>
              <p>A lot of other examples. Some very cheap programmes but highly
              effective eg ACMS. All with a specific role that is highly
              calculated to meet specific and clear defence needs.</p>
              <p>The F-15 was not a good value for money purchase</p>

              <p>I don't think it was "increased" as a percentage, it's always been a fixed fraction of the GDP, and since last year we had a very large economy increase (28% I think?), the budget automatically shot up to reflect this. It's not really a spending increase and depending on how "generous" the SAF is feeling, a lot of it might just go back into the budget surplus pool later.</p>
              <p>Though Malaysia is getting a lot of nice equipment like new fighters, upgrading their MEKO 100s and artillery rockets like the ASTROS. A worrying potential buy is the Brahamos for their Kedah/MEKOs. That thing is a genuine threat to ships.</p>
              <p>Amanda, the Leo and Typh are opinions, not hard fact. You have to factor in the retiring of the SM-1, which means we have a shortage of tanks and an excess of crew, and that the Typhoon can't do air to ground very well, so is not suitable for Singapore. We have a lack of air crew, so a plane has to multi-task i.e do air superiority AND ground support due to our lack of manpower. The Typhoon can only do air.</p>
