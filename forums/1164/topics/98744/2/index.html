[S'pore was well into the self-government era by now, &amp; the riot would occur around Merger time.] The Government agreed, &amp; created a committee which recommended a 4-step, progressively-paced rehabilitation programme for criminals: jail for one year or so, then VOLUNTEER to go to Pulau Senang for 6 months to learn a trade, then return to join a regimented Work Brigade for another 6 months, before being released back into society.<br><br>The island Superintendent, Daniel Dutton, was a very-motivated Robinson Crusoe type.

Note: Even after the riot &amp; murders, none of the inmates attempted to flee - they stayed put instead, rejoicing &amp; singing songs until the police reinforcements arrived! Josey suggested a number of rationales:<br><br>- Dutton (for all his well-meaning streak) controlled the inmates' fate: he could withhold advancing them to the next stage of rehabiliation or, worse yet, send them back to the overcrowding jail at any time. The latter would represent eternal hell for those who were gangsters imprisoned indefinately under the ISD Act.<br><br>- the criminals weren't sophisticated enough to think of absconding to even Malaya. What stood out in the book weren't their individual personalities but their common backgrounds (20something, unmarried, curtailed or no education, menial jobs, parents died early, poverty) which IMO turns the societal nature/nurture argument back on its head.<br><br>- most insidously, the inference was that the inmates were hardcore secret-society members &amp; totally indoctrinated with its values. They were prepared to "eat bitter", even face death, out of perceived loyalty &amp; brotherhood.<br><br>As stated, I'm curious to see if the TCS version interpret these differently, if not add new insights (since the trailer says it's a multi-part show).</div>
