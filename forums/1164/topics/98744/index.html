The island which we now know as the SAF live fire area was once our version of the rock(alcatraz sp?)it was a horrible place that death row and lifers were sent too.The warden was a bitch of a fellow and thus the people plotted to break out.The over powered the guards and killed them all.The warden was hung,had his eyes cut out and his balls cut off.Some fled to Indonasia while the rest were caught or killed by the British army or police sent there.<br>This is what my dad told me.He was young when this happened so it might be alittle off but the base facts are there</div>

On March 26, Malaysian authorities suddenly moved to forcibly repatriate hundreds of Acehnese refugees housed in several camps.<br><br>The Aceh Merdeka representatives say that the Malaysian police, who control the detention camps, [b]drugged the refugees' food</strong> the night before. <strong>Elite police units</strong> in full riot gear and attack dogs then surrounded the camps at dawn.<br><br>The refugees, fearing for their lives if returned to Indonesia, <strong>fought back with their bare hands</strong>. At the Semenyih centre, <strong>police fired on the refugees with automatic rifles</strong>, killing at least 24, according to refugee sources. Many others were severely wounded.<br><br>Deadly incidents also occurred at other detention centres, bringing the death toll to at least 30 before all the refugees were concentrated at the Lumut Naval Base in Perak state.<br><br>The Malaysian government claims that only eight refugees and one police officer were killed in the Â“riotsÂ” at the detention centres.<br><br>Some 545 refugees were put aboard Indonesian navy ships on March 29. At least eight refugees died en route to Lhokseumawe in Aceh. The <strong>Malaysian authorities refused to give the wounded medical attention or even wash the blood from them before they were put aboard</strong>.<br>-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br><br>Notice that in Singapore, Scouts helped against armed Soldiers.

            <div class='col-md body'>The Singapore Mutiny is more famous in Indian &amp; British history than in local context. To us, it is remembered more as foreign troops (from a BN of the Indian army) attacking their colonial masters, before the predecessor of the PDF was mobilized to put down the disturbance.<br><br>Updated to today, I guess it would be something like the visiting US Navy midshipmen raising hell in town, &amp; local police is needed to help their MPs in regaining control. Technically not a mutiny though, but how many armed foreign troops do we host nowadays?<br><br>The Pulau Senang riot was detailed in a Alex Josey publication before, titled "The Experiment That Failed" if I'm correct. Read it when I was much younger - very curious to see how TCS will dramatize it.<br><br>The only similarity with the Alcatraz is that both facilities were isolated out on an island. The Pulau Senang inmates weren't as shackled, but were subject to (relentless) hard labor that was energetically advocated by its ang-mo superviser - who believed in such work ethic as positive rehabilitation. The "experiment" actually worked for 3 years, before suddenly imploding into tragedy. The casualty rate, while brutal, was actually small (only 4 killed), but 18 perpetrators were sentenced to die.<br></div>

Anyway, the mutiny is not only part of Singapore's history-its also Malaysia's. About the Boy Scouts taking over the duties of security personnel-any former Scouts here? One of the things that they teach Scouts then was how to use morse code so its not illogical for boy scouts to take over the duties of security personnel during times of crisis, especially when every able bodied soldier or policeman was needed to quell the mutiny,as it was in this case.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I thumbed through my library shelves last night ....<br><br>IMO One quite-detailed recent account of the Mutiny can be found in Ban Kah Choon's "Absent History" from '01. He expounded that its biggest legacy was actually the founding of the Special Branch (forerunner of the ISD), cuz the British woke up to the fact that S'pore was no longer a prosperous colony insulated from worldly developments. Even as instant retribution was severe - the riot ringleaders were publicly executed - more colonial attention would be paid to internal security of British possessions &amp; interests.<br><br>The actual jolt was caused, foremost, by troops dissatisfid with cantonment duties &amp; indifferent leadership. But there's a larger dimension, too, lurking in the background:<br><br>(a) politics: WWI had broken out half a year earlier, &amp; Turkey sided with the Central Powers. Together with Germany, they attempted to subvert against the British Empire. Some of the mutineers would attempt to free German POWs at Tanglin Barracks.<br><br>(b) religion: Turkey issued a jihad, plus Malayan &amp; Indian-Army Muslims didn't like Britain warring against it anyway. The humiliating Dardanelles/Gallipoli campaigns would occur later in the same year (1915).<br><br>(c) nationalism: Indians were inspired by the anti-imperialist successes of the Bolsheviks, Japanese &amp; Chinese.<br><br>(d) ideology: the Ghadr militants advocated a violent overthrow of the colonial warlords.<br><br>Ban's account actually downplayed the role of the constabulary actions. S'pore was still quite ulu then, with the mutineers numbering some 300 vs. 600 defending troops. The eventual casualty rate was put at around 40, &amp; most disturbances occurred on the 1st day before fizzling out came the new dawn (due to no real objectives). The whole thing was relatively isolated as well: the German POWs &amp; local defence forces refused to join them, &amp; one group of riots who ventured towards town was easily stopped. Then it was a straightforward matter of rounding them up for trial.</div>
