              <p class="textBodyBlack">CARACAS, Venezuela - The leaders of Colombia and Ecuador ordered troops to their borders with Colombia after the killing a top rebel leader on Ecuadorean soil.</p>
              <p class="textBodyBlack">But Colombia said documents seized at the rebel camp hit by its commandos indicate Ecuador's president is deepening relations with Colombia's main guerrilla group.</p>
              <p class="textBodyBlack">Denouncing Colombia's slaying of Raul Reyes' slaying in Ecuador, President Hugo Chavez said Venezuela will respond militarily if Colombia violates its border. He ordered Venezuela's embassy in Bogota closed. <br><br>"Mr. Defense Minister, move 10 battalions to the border with Colombia for me, immediately — tank battalions. Deploy the air force," Chavez said during his weekly TV and radio program. "We don't want war, but we aren't going to permit the U.S. empire, which is the master (of Colombia) ... to come divide us." <br><br>Chavez called Colombian President Alvaro Uribe "a criminal" and branded his government a "terrorist state," likening it to Israel for its U.S.-backed attacks on militants.</p>

              <p>Chavez is a grandstanding asswipe who thinks with his dick...</p>
              <p>he has a point sometimes with Bush but like they say, a blind chicken sometimes pecks a centipede if it pecks enough..</p>
              <p>FARC has no political goals.. it has been kidnapping and murdering people with a paper-thin excuse of "political rebels".. universally loathed in Columbia for their destabilising influence through violence and mayhem, Chavez picked a donkey in a horse race this time..</p>
              <p>hell, it isn't even in the same race, or the same species..</p>
              <p>FARC is just banditry.. and Chavez is again grandstanding..</p>
              <p>now if he decides to wade into Columbia over a bunch of terrorists whom he got chummy with, expect no one, not even the worse idiots in the UN to back him up.. because ultimately, the problem with FARC is Columbia's..</p>

              <p>Chavez was supported by the FARC when he was in prison a long time ago.. he owes them.. also, he's a grandstanding idiot who thinks he's some kind of "revolutionary" so he supports these "rebels"..</p>
              <p>the recent nonsense with releasing of hostages kidnapped by the FARC for ransom (note: not political but for ransom) because of Chavez "persuading" FARC to let them go now smells fishy as week-old fishguts in the sun...</p>

              <p>I guess the tension will continue until full deployment.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>CARACAS, Venezuela (AP) — Hundreds of Venezuelan troops deployed for the Colombian border on Tuesday under orders from President Hugo Chavez, who is sending about 9,000 soldiers to the frontier.</p>
              <p>Hundreds of troops were seen boarding four buses and eight trucks at the Paramaracay base in the central city of Valencia on Tuesday morning, headed for the border. Their convoy also included fuel trucks and cranes. A helicopter flew overhead.</p>
              <p>A base official, speaking on condition of anonymity because she wasn't permitted to speak to reporters, said the troops were heading for the Colombian border, though she didn't specify the location.</p>
              <p>Elsewhere, in the northern state of Lara, pro-Chavez Gov. Luis Reyes said Tuesday that battalions in his state were heading for the border.</p>
              <p>"There are mobilizations in Lara state toward the border zone," Reyes, a former lieutenant colonel, told the Venezuelan television station Globovision.</p>
              <p>The Venezuelan military has been tightlipped about the movement of troops since Sunday, when Chavez ordered 10 battalions to the border, including tanks.</p>
              <p>Retired Gen. Alberto Muller Rojas, a former aide and close ally of Chavez, told The Associated Press that the 10 battalions being sent to the border region include approximately 9,000 men. He called the troop deployment entirely "preventive."</p>
              <p>Chavez deployed troops in response to Colombia's killing of a top rebel leader on Ecuadorean soil over the weekend. Ecuador has also sent troops to its border with Colombia, denouncing the military strike as a violation of its sovereignty.</p>

              <p>Hugo has been trying to stir up hostile feelings towards Columbia all this while.  However, his intentions for such an invasion would be unknown unless he simply miscalculated his own capabilities. </p>
              <p>While the Columbians have nothing that can stop Hugo's 24 Sukhois, the USAF and USN are more than happy to establish a No-Fly zone over Venezuela &amp; Ecuador.  I'd look forward to examining the first Superbug vs Sukhoi engagement.  Its gonna either make or break Boeing sales.</p>
