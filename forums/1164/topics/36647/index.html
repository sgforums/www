            <div class='col-md body'>I'm sure lotsa people read this in Jane's Combat Arms manual; it stated that the Ultimax is a good weapon, just that it was poor marketing strategy...it came out after major armies have already selected their SAWs...the U.S. being one of them. However, I believe that its still the best LMG around. Anyone ever carried the full load of 4 hundred rds drum mags before?</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>It's possibly the finest and most cost-effective SAW around, but it's lack of publicity preludes it from widespread sales... it came out at the wrong time lah...</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I remember that the US Navy Seal once bought a batch of Ultimax 100 (most likely pre Mk 3 version). However, it has never been accepted as widespread adoption in the Navy or the Marines. Other than Croatia, ST Kinetics (Charted Industries) did sell to a number of customers, including the Phillippines and Burma I think.<br></div>
