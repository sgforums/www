            <div class='col-md body'><strong><a href="http://www.sgforums.com/?action=thread_display&amp;thread_id=149253" rel="nofollow">LALEE to replace E2C?</a></strong><br><br><blockquote>BrÃ©vot explains that LALEE is still undefined, but that Singapore's requirement is for a much larger aircraft than the Eagle, with a take-off weight in the 15t class.<br><br>He points out however that two or three Eagles operating together, using sensor fusion techniques, could fulfil the same requirement, and could do so more cheaply.</blockquote>2.Burt Rutan is involved in LALEE!!<br><br>LALEE OF Sg<br><blockquote>     The project acronym is LALEE, which stands for low-altitude long-enduring endurance, but the low is a relative term, meaning that this platformÂ’s projected cruising altitude of 60,000 feet is lower than that of satellite surveillance systems. Endurance is self-explanatory, meaning a long dwell time such as is already demonstrated by the Northrop Grumman Global Hawk unmanned aerial vehicle. Long-enduring is a reference to the DSOÂ’s aim that this platform should be in service for 30 years.......<br><br>Prof. Lui Pao Chuen. He showed delegates attending the C4I conference a twin-boom design with (naturally) a long wing. Little has been said since, although a government minister did acknowledge last November that the LALEE was a potential E-2C Hawkeye replacement in the Republic of Singapore Air Force (RSAF).<br><br>Unlike the Global Hawk, Predator-B and U-2, which rule todayÂ’s high-altitude skies, the LALEE is a twin-boom, twin-engine design. The two powerplants are for redundancy, but also to provide increased electrical power to the sensors. The sensor payloads would presumably be modular and interchangeable, as they are on the Global Hawk and the U-2.<br><br>In the early stages of this project, the DSO(of Sg)engaged maverick U.S. designer Burt Rutan as a consultant. RutanÂ’s company, Scaled Composites, has developed its own high-altitude, twin-boom, twin-engine design, the Proteus. It is not known whether Rutan continues to<strong> advise the DSO on the LALEE, which is somewhat largerÂ–approximately the wingspan and fuselage length of a Boeing 737, and with an mtow of about 15 tons.</strong><br><br>The intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance (ISR) community will be watching the LALEE development with interest, since it could potentially offer an alternative to the current U.S. dominance of the HALE market, at a time when interest in these platforms is taking off around the world. For instance, at the UAV conference earlier this week, EADS InternationalÂ’s senior vice president Gen. Jean-Georges Brevot noted that France could be expected to introduce a HALE UAV between 2010 and 2015.<br><br></blockquote>--http://www.ainonline.com/Publications/asian/asian_04/d3_dronep3.html<br><strong><a href="http://www.ainonline.com/Publications/asian/asian_04/d3_dronep3.html" rel="nofollow">Singapore/EADS may do spy drone,by Chris Pocock<br></a></strong></div>
