            <div class='col-md body'>While we should not take the post too seriously but our leader has this to say during an interview back in 2005<br><br><strong>SPIEGEL: What are your reservations?<br><br>Mr. Lee: I don't know whether the next generation will stay on this course. After 15 or 20 years they may feel their muscles are very powerful. We know the mind of the leaders but the mood of the people on the ground is another matter. Because there's no more communist ideology to hold the people together, the ground is now galvanised by Chinese patriotism and nationalism. Look at the anti-Japanese demonstrations</strong>.<br><br>it is obverse that PRC are moving out in great numbers and they bring along  the attribute of patriotism and nationalism towards China.  They can be an emotional and irrational bunch. Take a look at the other talk forum.  The main point is not so much of high lighting the negative aspect of Singaporean but how to preserve Singaporean identity.  After all we are probably 2nd ,or  3rd   or maybe 4th generation in Singapore.  Chinese Singaporean does not share the common value of that of PRC counterpart.<br><br>My concern and I think it is a valid concern is that at what point does the emotional settlement gets into politics and draw salt with Singapore.  At what point does the PRC felt that with its size it has all the influence over Singapore.<br></div>

Sometime the discontent from Influx of foreign is indirectly reflecting the different characteristics of these identities unfornately not in the best light.<br><br>After all we said our pleages from primary school thru secondary school, vocation, serve NS, slaved in work, worried about housing, cost of living, Screw PAP. Hey !!!That is what we do.   We have foreigner who come in from different background and judge the people without go thru the above experiences.<br><br>with China it is typically sensititive because there are money that pour into china from Singapore Tax payer money. There are free riders that make use of what singapore which uses its reputation with US and its system and leap frog into other nation at the expense of Singaporean good will and tax payer money.<br><br>Of course being a city state, Singapore has to i believe swallow a "Tough Pill". China is big that goes without saying, But i think it play by its own Rule. Unlike Singapore,  it succeed thru having a Fair playing field in the international business environment, and succeed in a fair economic environment.<br><br>So yeah gov is pissing in their own pants.<br></div>
