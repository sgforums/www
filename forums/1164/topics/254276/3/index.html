            <div class='col-md body'>I would assume that many of these people posting such messages are probably students or young people with too much time on their hands, and do not seem to be very well-informed and somewhat immature. I don't think we should take it too seriously and get too perturbed.<br><br>Having said that, the nationalism that the Chinese have is a worrying trend. It appears they have very little choice in expressing any political view unless its a rabidly nationalist one. Chinese who doubt the CCP don't seem to hang around very much, if you get my drift. I do find that a bit disturbing.<br><br>Ah well, as someone on the thread has mentioned, the net is free space for free views. Just take it with a pinch of salt and try not to get too upset. Arguing with people like these will very likely be a futile exercise anyway.</div>
