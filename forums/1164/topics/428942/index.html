              The Austrian minister of defence Darabos named General Entacher, an 61 years old experienced officer, to his chief of general-staff, as highest commander of the Austrian army one year ago. Then the minister intented to eliminate the todays forced military duty for every healthy 18 years old man in Austria. He wanted to install a professional army instead. General Entacher was against this ministery intention and covered some sentences of  the written order of Darabos in this case by black color with his pen. 
              The minister was then very angry about this action of his general and dismissed him suddenly. Now the other Austrian officers got also very angry, because they were afraid, that they also could loose their military positions because of lack of young soldiers. There are now many young soldiers in the Austrian army, who are restricted to military service by law. They do not get much money from the state for their service. The Austrian officers know, that - if the foced military duty is given away - very few professional-soldiers were comeing to the Austrian army for the payings, which Austria could affort. The officers are against minister Darabos, because the founding of a profession army would mean the destructure of the Austrian army and the eliminateing of their military existence.

              <p>I personally think their pay is not that bad</p>
              <p>in south korea , 1991 , pay for a conscript for 3 years of service was 10dollars usd a month</p>
              <p>yes its the south not the communist north</p>
              <p>currently last heard was 80-100usd , 22 months. and recurits would be stationed 24 hours 7 days a week in their camp in combat units , no signing out since the soldiers would most likely be posted to the border , far from their home.</p>
              <p>i suppose compare to ns in singapore ,it may not be that bad after all.</p>
