I have seen his other postings. I know a racist when I see one. His feelings and concerns are similar to that felt by many minorities although they may not voice them out.<br><br>I have close friends from other races.

            <div class='col-md body'>thank you for that tspg.As part of a minority and as part of the majority,I can bridge the gaps to an extent.<br><br>however,as one person articulated,yes,I am young.I am interested in knowing what opprtunities lie in store for me in my homeland.As a member of the minority and majority who grew up here,I have a vested interest  in what happens to members of my communities.<br><br>Many minorities feel unsure of their places in what is a predominantly Chinese nation.For example,many similarly feel that the government is rather too pro-Chinese on some issues,such as the SAP schools.<br><br>If we are nurturing an elite to engage China,why not nurture elites to engage Thailand,Indonesia and Malaysia as well as India,Pakistan,Iran and other South Asian powerhouses?<br><br>My perception is that the governemt is rather too pro-China,and that we should not invest so much in that nation.I am wary of it.furthermore,is it my imagination or is it easier for Chinese to become citizens or PRs?<br><br>Minorities want to know what their place is in our society,what their role is and what the future holds for us.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>To Sardaukar,<br><br>I may be able to comment on some of the issues you raise because I am from an SAP schoool. The purpose of setting up SAP schools by the govt was to preserve the traditions of such schools and to build up a core group of younger Singaporens with an in depth understanding of the Chinese culture to engage an emerging China.<br><br>Being immerse in the Chinese culture does not make one a chauvinist. In my school there are efforts to let us interact and understand the culture of other races. I have friend from other races in my neighbourhood, in tertiary institutions, in the army and in working life.<br><br>Being the most westernised of all the races in Singapore, the Chinese are at the highest risk of losing their culture identity and hence the efforts to help SAP schools. The govt has also help other races through organisation such as Sinda and Muis.<br><br>As for creating links with other ASEAN countries, there are several scholarship programmes that invite the brightest from these countries to study here. They will serve as a bridge to understanding between Singapore and other countries in future. As for our officers who are deployed to other countries they are given intensive cultural immersion programmes in the country they are deployed to.<br><br>The immgration Issue.<br>The primary concern in deciding whether a person is granted citizenship is his/her ability to contribute to Singapore. A world class researcher from any race from any country would be welcome in Singapore.<br><br>The race does play a part in botherline cases. A person who is of ethnic descent from the major races in Singapore will stand a higher chance than someone who is Vietnamese or Filipino. Such a policy is maintain the balance and stability of  the ethnic make-up in Singapore. Such a policy is not unique to Singapore but other countries as well.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>"Just try and do the best in the vocation they decide to put me in."<br><br>Bravo then. I don't think racial prejudice's that relevant in the SAF anymore, even as I realize you'll probably be a 1st-generation, local-born enlistee from your family. But your peers are part of the current 3G crop, so if anything it's their parents' batches (those who served in the mid '70's to early '80s) that faced most mistrust over their own forefathers' chauvinist/communist ties. I dare say you'll lagi confirm pass if if you've gone thru the local education.<br><br>I'm sure they still do discreet background checking for sensitive vocations, but IMHO it's not really very different from those in the civilian world (eg. SIA). Screening &amp; blacklisting, however, are different things &amp; I'm fairly certain there's no bureaucratic leviathan overseeing this area. The SAF, even NSF itself, is just too multi-layered a system.<br><br>If the CDO take you on, then good luck. I'm not sure they conduct BMTs seasonally (every 3 months) like Tekong, though - so what if your enlistment timing is all "wrong" for them?<br><br>The bulk of combat units are also filled by mono-intake people, so on paper a Telong/SBMT "outsider" can only be posted in via 2 ways: relevant vocation-training by the pertinent formation (inc. after going thru OCS or SISPEC) or more general vocation-training by service formations. It won't be as if you can, say, aim for 3rd Guards on your initial reporting day, unless you've signed on or something. Instead, your only input resources - as far as influencing your hoped-for posting goes - are during the PC interviews, &amp; of course your course results, which'll entail your DIs' feedback.<br><br>With the latter, I actually had 1st-hand experience after being attached to Arty Training Cadre, due to my extra half-year. My recruit battery had a few pai kia's, inc. 2 gangsters (inc. one bodily tattooed who came under my section) whom the instructors were informally told to mix together with care. I dunno if the word came down from ISD or whatever, but they turned out to be normal peng.<br><br>What's more didactic was that my BC, &amp; indirectly my CO, depended heavily on the DIs' recommendations on who to retain as gunners after BMT. I have to confess that not all of us were 100% honorable in our judgement calls, even as we reached no consensus on whether posting out (to storemen-type appointments) represents a "reward" &amp; retaining an underachiever is a "punishment". But generally we tried to be fair, &amp; every evaluation was performance-rated with no racial shenanigans.<br><br>I dunno if the Tekong BMT culture is similar &amp; here's guessing these are gonna be the overall nature of appraisals you'll go through, &amp; it'll be the same with the follow-ons at SISPEC or OCS.</div>
