I took my ICT IPPT in March @ Maju and the route is definitely better than 6 rounds of stadium track.

But how does duck walk improves SBJ? My worrant officer told me the same thing, but can't understand the logic behind it. </blockquote>You need to improve your leg muscles first, there some exe you could do.<br><br>First the upper leg, I think it is called the half squat:<br>1) Legs shoulder length apart, arms at your side.<br>2) Bend both your knees and try to reach the ankles by both your hands at the side. Your body should remain in upright position as much as possible.<br>3) Resume back to starting position.<br><br>This good good for your upper leg muscle.<br><br>The next will be the lower leg muscle,<br>1) Legs shoulder length apart, arms at your side.<br>2) Stand at your toes by lifting your heel off the ground.<br><br>After doing the above two exe for every day for a week or so,(20-30 counts), you need to train all your "spring" power.<br><br>1) Assume SBJ position or swimmer's diving position.<br>2) Jump up as high as possible.<br><br>As I said, the exe 1 &amp; 2 will help to build up your leg muscles for the first week then from 2nd week all three exe (all at least 20-30 counts), afterwhich you start doing the standard SBJ and see whether any improvement.<br><br>Word of caution , make sure you do sufficient stretching exe b4 you start and warm down stretching after them , and rest a a day or so if you feel uncomfortable. Remember stretching exe is very important for such exe!!</div>
