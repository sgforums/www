            <div class='col-md body'>In 1982, the ISD exposed and expelled two Russian spies for espionage activities in Singapore. One was Anatoly Alexeyevich Larkin, a Soviet military intelligence (GRU) officer, who attempted to cultivate a SAF army officer holding the rank of 2nd Lieutenant to conduct espionage against the SAF. The other was Alexander Alexandrovich Bondarev, another Soviet military intelligence officer, who was sent to take over a Soviet spy network which had a local agent working for it since the 1970s................<br><br>.........I wonder if Ivan Bond 008 is still in SAF?.....<br>.Mat Bond?........<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Those evnts occurred more than 2 decades ago. In addition, the Soviet spies mentioned were exposed and expelled publicly. When things are opened to the public, it usually means that no major secrets were compromised and the culprits were caught before they could find out anything of importance.<br><br>However, when you don't hear anything and nothing is made public, it means either:<br>- No spies are caught.<br>- Spies are caught but information has been compromised so trial has to take place in secret.<br>- There are no spies operating in the country at all.<br><br>Since we haven't heard any such events happening in our dear northern cousin for any point in the last 50 years, what can we conclude?

I applaud the minister for being willing to face the truth and cite such cases. A positive point from the whole episode is that our counter intelligence is functional, of course not denying that there might still be penetration of our security apparatus. Alas...the ocean is big and the fishes many. The absence of such incidents as reported publicly in malaysia could be either the Malaysian Government is too embarassed to admit that they have been penetrated or that these foreign operatives have not been ferreted out and thus highlighting the extreme incompetence of the country CI agencies which I do not think so.  You would be extremely naive to assume that nobody is interested in Malaysia's business and your country is certified spy - free  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"> Incidentally I quote from Tim Huxley Defending the Lion City which included a section stating that in the 1980s, Singapore mounted a major HUMINT operation against Malaysia to acquire information on the MAF force modernisation plan. According to his account, the operation was eventually  compromised with arrest of 8 suspects but before large amount of valuable data was obtained. There is a very good reason why spying has often been called the world oldest profession  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"> everybody loves to find out secrets <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_twisted.gif" alt="Twisted Evil" title="Twisted Evil"></div>
