What useful information could they get out of Singapore? Singapore is just a tiny little country which is of no threat to the Soviet Union.<br><br>Could it be that the Soviet are interested in World Domination (Hegemony)? Are they planing to liberate Singapore and the entire world?<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_question.gif" alt="Question" title="Question">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_question.gif" alt="Question" title="Question">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_question.gif" alt="Question" title="Question"> </div></blockquote>Yes soviet is indeed interested in conducting espionage in tiny Singapore. They are interested in the wide varities of food we have here. They want the secret recipes of Katong Laska, Chilli crabs, Mee sIam, satay and a lot more .<br>Why the military have make deep analyst that by learning all these secret recipe, they can open lots of S11 coffeeshop all over russia and they will earn big money.<br><br>Also they can put extra chilli in Laska to be serve to spies or others like idwar, which will kill them instantly and fast.<br><br>So don't be surprise you see a few soviet running around with Makansutra, and asking a lot of question on food !!!<br><br></div>
