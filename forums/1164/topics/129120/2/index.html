Because it is also government-affiliated, of course. And the KL government is jealous of us making something out of nothing when they have all the natural resources but no means to strike it rich. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"> (If we took over their plantations, we can do better, I swear.)<br><br>Back in Singapore, our media outlets are so stifled that all the news becomes bland. People like Lazerlords have turned to online sources like AFP. Some of their releases would never be printed or aired in Singapore.<br><br>Compare both cases to that of UK. The British have got the <span style="font-style: italic;">Daily Mirror</span>. It is famous for sending undercover journos to weed out scandals everywhere. The paper openly disagrees with propaganda it doesn't like and washes the dirty linen of public servants. Such things can go to press because civil rights are well-entrenched in society. KL and Singapore have much catching up to do.</div>
