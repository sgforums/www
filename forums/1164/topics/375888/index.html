              <p>SG is neither a younger brother nor military outpost of USA.</p>
              <p>There are few leaders in the world dare to crush with US Presidents.</p>
              <p>SG leaders is one of the few of them.</p>
              <p>Take the case of Michael Faye as example.</p>
              <p>In other countries,a letter of US Ambassdor or US Vice President or</p>
              <p>Secreatay of State is more than enough to get the teenager freed.</p>
              <p>Who wont give face to US Predsident?Only Singapore leader.</p>
              <p>SG president just  reduced two strokes of canning.</p>
              <p>@@@@@@@@@@@</p>
              <p>There are many countries think SG is younger brother</p>
              <p>or military outpost of USA.This is wrong.</p>
              <p>Young brother just listen to the big brother.</p>
              <p>But SG dared to say NO.What do u think other countries</p>
              <p>leaders would do when Michael Faye commit crime in their countries</p>
              <p>and the leaders get a letter from US President.</p>
              <p>I think Faye would be released in 24 hours,</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>2.SG and USA are friends.But it dunt mean SG agree everythings</p>
              <p>that USA do.Do u agree everything your spouse do?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>3.SG,as logistic center of USA,do not mean it is a outpost of USA.</p>
              <p>This is a give and take .SG will be benefited in many ways</p>
              <p>when SG is a logistic center.There are few draw backs.</p>
              <p>One of them would be SG regarded as US's outpost.</p>
              <p>4.Let me do things in MY WAY.Like LKY said,"Do not tell me</p>
              <p>how to arrange furniture in my house"</p>
              <p>Likewise,dunt tell me whom i can entertain in my house.</p>
              <p>@@@@@@@@@@@@@</p>
              <p>So,i think The Star article,which is widely quoted in China,is a big joke.</p>

              <p><strong>Singapore’s
              armed forces buildup suggests it could be an outpost in the security
              chain the US is building around China, and this is contrary to the
              spirit of Asean, of which it is a member.</strong></p>
              <p>A LEADING US
              international intelligence agency recently published a significant
              report defining US-Singapore military cooperation and highlighting
              Singapore as one of the US’ prime regional strategic alliances and
              recipients of military assistance.</p>
              <p>It also highlighted the objective of this cooperation.</p>
              <p>Singapore
              owns the most modern armed forces in this region. With US military
              cooperation, support and guarantee, Singapore is equipped with the most
              advanced military equipment in the world.</p>
              <p>According to military
              experts, Singapore’s military buildup is the best in terms of
              tactical-technological advancement in South East Asia.</p>
              <p>The article <em>Singapore’s Military Buildup: US Assists City-State to Improve Defences to Deter China</em> specifically mentions that the continuous modernisation of Singapore’s
              armed forces is meant to become the key link in the security chain that
              the US is building around China.</p>
              <p>The cooperation is viewed as a move to deter China.</p>
              <p>Mark Helprin, an analyst from the Claremont Institute asserts that China is more dangerous than the Soviet Union.</p>
              <p>The weakening of the US economically and militarily is giving rise to a new centre of power.</p>
              <p>The
              US economy, mismanaged and drained by its global wars on terrorism, is
              increasingly dependent on Chinese trade imports and on Chinese holdings
              of US treasury securities.</p>
              <p>China is the biggest preserver of the US dollar with US$825bil (RM3tril) worth.</p>
              <p>Princeton
              University Professor Chris Hedges said if Beijing decided to abandon
              the US bond market, even in part, it would have a serious effect on the
              value of the US currency.</p>
              <p>Consequently, it would lead to the
              collapse of the US$7tril (RM25tril) US real estate market, and there
              would be a wave of US bank failures and huge unemployment.</p>
              <p>This
              psychological threat creates fear in the White House. Thus the buildup
              of security chains around China is deemed necessary. Japan, Australia,
              Thailand, the Philippines and Indonesia have already taken their place
              in the anti-China security chain.</p>
              <p>Singapore being an advanced
              and developed country within South East Asian is deemed important in
              the US deterrence policy towards China.</p>
              <p>Singapore’s military
              spending doubled to US$8bil (RM28bil) in 2008. With such an allocation,
              its armed force is well positioned to acquire the sophisticated weapons
              and technologies it needs.</p>
              <p>Many strategic analysts believe that
              with such an arsenal, Singapore is able to destroy enemies on the
              ground, pre-emptively seize strategic territory and intervene quickly
              and effectively in Indonesia, Malaysia and other likely trouble spots
              in the contested South China Sea.</p>
              <p>Like Israel, which lacks
              strategic depth and is outnumbered by potentially hostile neighbours,
              Singapore’s defence strategy is two-fold: build an offensive-minded
              security force that can strike at potential enemies before they harm
              it, and seek the support and protection of the US.</p>
              <p>Besides
              Singapore, the US is also continuously seeking other potential
              strategic allies in the region like Thailand, Malaysia and Indonesia.</p>
              <p>It is also raising the prospect of a return to Subic Bay in the Philippines.</p>
              <p>At
              present, Singapore allows the US Pacific Naval Command to use its port
              for repair, replacing the role of Subic Bay which was closed in the
              1990s.</p>
              <p>Australia and Japan have already entered strong agreement with the US in the anti-China security chain.</p>
              <p>US
              involvement in Singapore’s armed forces has led Singapore to become a
              big power partner of the US anti-China security policy in the Asia
              Pacific.</p>
              <p>Undeniably, this kind of relationship sidesteps the
              Asean spirit to remain neutral and free from geo-political intimidation
              and interference.</p>
              <p>Singapore’s effort to modernise its fighting
              forces, working to better integrate its force with that of the US and
              Australia and other regional militaries, and being located at one of
              the world’s most strategic checkpoints – both economically and
              militarily – will likely see it emerge later as a front-line outpost in
              the escalating military confrontation between the US and China.</p>
              <p>It is time now, for peace loving countries in this region to reject this kind of engagement.</p>
              <p>Any
              process towards war must be blocked by any means. Malaysia should take
              the lead to mobilise member states of Asean to realise the spirit of
              non-confrontation and mutual cooperation.</p>
              <p>The military policy and strategy that encourage arms race and suspicion must be avoided at all means."--EOQ</p>

              <p><strong>Singapore’s armed forces buildup suggests it could be an outpost in the security chain the US is building around China, and this is contrary to the spirit of Asean, of which it is a member.</strong></p>
              <p>A LEADING US international intelligence agency recently published a significant report defining US-Singapore military cooperation and highlighting Singapore as one of the US’ prime regional strategic alliances and recipients of military assistance.</p>
              <p>It also highlighted the objective of this cooperation.</p>
              <p>Singapore owns the most modern armed forces in this region. With US military cooperation, support and guarantee, Singapore is equipped with the most advanced military equipment in the world.</p>
              <p>According to military experts, Singapore’s military buildup is the best in terms of tactical-technological advancement in South East Asia.</p>
              <p>The article <em>Singapore’s Military Buildup: US Assists City-State to Improve Defences to Deter China</em> specifically mentions that the continuous modernisation of Singapore’s armed forces is meant to become the key link in the security chain that the US is building around China.</p>
              <p>The cooperation is viewed as a move to deter China.</p>
              <p>Mark Helprin, an analyst from the Claremont Institute asserts that China is more dangerous than the Soviet Union.</p>
              <p>The weakening of the US economically and militarily is giving rise to a new centre of power.</p>
              <p>The US economy, mismanaged and drained by its global wars on terrorism, is increasingly dependent on Chinese trade imports and on Chinese holdings of US treasury securities.</p>
              <p>China is the biggest preserver of the US dollar with US$825bil (RM3tril) worth.</p>
              <p>Princeton University Professor Chris Hedges said if Beijing decided to abandon the US bond market, even in part, it would have a serious effect on the value of the US currency.</p>
              <p>Consequently, it would lead to the collapse of the US$7tril (RM25tril) US real estate market, and there would be a wave of US bank failures and huge unemployment.</p>
              <p>This psychological threat creates fear in the White House. Thus the buildup of security chains around China is deemed necessary. Japan, Australia, Thailand, the Philippines and Indonesia have already taken their place in the anti-China security chain.</p>
              <p>Singapore being an advanced and developed country within South East Asian is deemed important in the US deterrence policy towards China.</p>
              <p>Singapore’s military spending doubled to US$8bil (RM28bil) in 2008. With such an allocation, its armed force is well positioned to acquire the sophisticated weapons and technologies it needs.</p>
              <p>Many strategic analysts believe that with such an arsenal, Singapore is able to destroy enemies on the ground, pre-emptively seize strategic territory and intervene quickly and effectively in Indonesia, Malaysia and other likely trouble spots in the contested South China Sea.</p>
              <p>Like Israel, which lacks strategic depth and is outnumbered by potentially hostile neighbours, Singapore’s defence strategy is two-fold: build an offensive-minded security force that can strike at potential enemies before they harm it, and seek the support and protection of the US.</p>
              <p>Besides Singapore, the US is also continuously seeking other potential strategic allies in the region like Thailand, Malaysia and Indonesia.</p>
              <p>It is also raising the prospect of a return to Subic Bay in the Philippines.</p>
              <p>At present, Singapore allows the US Pacific Naval Command to use its port for repair, replacing the role of Subic Bay which was closed in the 1990s.</p>
              <p>Australia and Japan have already entered strong agreement with the US in the anti-China security chain.</p>
              <p>US involvement in Singapore’s armed forces has led Singapore to become a big power partner of the US anti-China security policy in the Asia Pacific.</p>
              <p>Undeniably, this kind of relationship sidesteps the Asean spirit to remain neutral and free from geo-political intimidation and interference.</p>
              <p>Singapore’s effort to modernise its fighting forces, working to better integrate its force with that of the US and Australia and other regional militaries, and being located at one of the world’s most strategic checkpoints – both economically and militarily – will likely see it emerge later as a front-line outpost in the escalating military confrontation between the US and China.</p>
              <p>It is time now, for peace loving countries in this region to reject this kind of engagement.</p>
              <p>Any process towards war must be blocked by any means. Malaysia should take the lead to mobilise member states of Asean to realise the spirit of non-confrontation and mutual cooperation.</p>
              <p>The military policy and strategy that encourage arms race and suspicion must be avoided at all means."--EOQ</p>

              <p>pls lah don't fall into the chinese propaganda article......Read your Sec 2 Chinese History of the 7 Warring States.</p>
              <p>The first collective security agreement was established against the powerful Qin state. When Qin attack 1 state the rest of the 5 states would send troops to aid. This help to maintain status quo.</p>
              <p>Counter this agreement Qin send its embassador to establish suspicous and lead to break up of this agreement.</p>
              <p>You can argue that todays Asean is not at war with China. But this is about projection of space and influence and gain support.</p>
