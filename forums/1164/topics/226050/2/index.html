Imagine England without Hastings. Without William, we wouldn't have Queen Elizabeth I. Without William, we would have King John,much less the Magna Carta and by connection the Westminster System. Without William, I highly doubt the world would what we know now. The United States, rooting from Norman conquered England mostly likely wouldn't be  the nation we know now.<br><br>Thats where I disagree about Genghis Khan. Can anybody say that human history has been irrevesibly changed by his conquests? Even the Yuan Dynasty lasted only about 90 years. Are the Mongolians spread around the world? Is Mongolian our lingua franca? By the virtue that the Mongol Empire was large but somewhat limited in its legacy.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote>Originally posted by storywolf:<br><strong>Alexander army - are make up of foot soldiers - Phalanx &amp; shield bearers , cavalry - a very good balance force , but more on close quarter combat.<br><br>Genghis khan - however is more on light cavarly. which is more on arrows, they have 2 blows one for fast shooting and one for long distance. Usually they engage enemy in long distance shooting. [b]The range of their arrows which is armour pericing is over 500m to 600m they can penterate the roman shields and armour easily.</strong> Usually each man will have 2-4 horse each so they can ride long distance.  Also usually they will pretent to retreat and attack later, which their mobility enable them.<br><br>I view of this I guess Alexander army is the strongest if face on and in close combat fight.  But in the end , I think if the Mongol refuse to get engage in close combat, but with range weapons and mobility, they should have the advantage over Alexander army.<br><br>[/b]</blockquote>Where every you read that man it's exaggerated<br>There is no way any human can provide a pull with enough force to shoot that far besides their strings might snap fast even if u cld pull that much. Even composite bows made these days can only provide a range of around 500 yards which is around 300m? Which honestly speaking is plenty.<br><br>Anyway on horse back,the pull of the bow is less and hence it's range.Usually by as much as 50%. Bows used by foot archers having a more stable platform and can also use more weight then a horse archer.<br><br>However the 1 advantage they did have, is speed. Which meant that they cld hit foot archers easier since those guys dont move.And since they are moving the foot archers will have a tougher time hitting them.<br><br>And yes like someone mentioned, the mongols did stop at east Hungary. I believe he stopped short of Poland.<br><br>And while many believe the Mongols were all powerful and could take on the world, honestly speaking they would have alot of trouble taking western Europe proper. It's a long explaination and theory so i wont type it up unless someone wants to know <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>The greatest i believe would either be The Timurids lead by Temur the Lame or if we went farther back Yes Alexander would be the other choice.<br>The rest just do not really stand up.<br>Hannibal while tactically 1 of the best, the very fact that he spent YEARS walking up and down Italy so he wants much of a conqueror.<br><br>The Roman Generals while good usually had a basic manual to read to and well they have good backing, politically.Most of their enemies were screwed by the Roman politics and stuff. Alexander went head on and bashed everyone in his path so yea. Besides he did more in his short life time then most.<br><br>Though i think Genghis did around the same.</div>
