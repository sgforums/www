We can't possibly go sell our arms to nations taking part in ethnic wars! </blockquote>To be realistic, there is no way we can predict when or where ethnic wars are going to take place. We can't really tell if our Singapore-made weapons will be use to kill innocent people and the act being taken on tv or photos 10 years down the road.<br><br>Further more i think we cannot control the use of the weapon after it is being sold simply because it doesn't belong to us anymore.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"></div>

Thats the reason why the newer M16A2 do not hve this function.<br><br>In the SAF we are never taught to fire auto with M16S1 due to the above reasons. Lets leave the auto firing to the GPMG and the Ultimax 100.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"></div>
