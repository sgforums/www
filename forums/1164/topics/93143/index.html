            <div class='col-md body'>The Yak-141 Freestyle is the world first supersonic STOVL fighter in the world. I think that it will be good to have a little air surpport for our LSTs taking part in possible more dangerous peace keeping missions. Since we are most likely to get the JSF we may consider getting the marine variant. Although we may not need this capability now but i think in the future when more countries in our region have acquired mini carriers such as Thailand, the STOVL fighters can be useful. We have to take note of the high possibility of China getting carriers as well, which are most likely to be carrying their upgraded fleet of Su-27s.

In peacetime, the LST will always carry only the amount of aircraft it's hanger can carry, thats the RSAF SOP which they want the RSN to follow. However in wartime, SOP might change to accomodate what the hanger and the flight deck and carry, that will onli at most result to 2 JSF on the LST (one in hangar and the other in the flight deck).<br><br>If you board any of the LST and if you had seen at least the mock up of a JSF, 2 JSFs even with folded wings within the hangar is impossible.</div>

I would've expected a self proclaimed knowledgable person like you to know better than make this kind of silly comparison.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes">  The size of Jurong shipyard is not the issue. Even if it was large enough, the fact is ST Shipbuilding lacks the funds &amp; expertise to make a carrier.<br><br>It is neither affordable nor practical for RSN to have an aircraft carrier. Should the day come that we can afford a carrier, the money would be better spent on other things, such as replacing our aging fleet of MGBs or PVs.<br><br>And LST is a landing ship tank as the acronym implies. You load a few ground vehicles into it, sail to somewhere, off load these ground vehicles. That's about it. Since its reasonably large, it can accommodate 2 copters for either SAR or anti-submarine purposes. That's about it.<br><br>A LST is NOT meant for accommodating jets or other fanciful thing that you have in your imagination. If we wanted something for accommodating jets, we would've bought over Thailand's white elephant of an aircraft carrier, which is currently sitting in the docks rusting away as they can't afford to send it out to sea.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Have large ships mean nothing without the ancillary systems.<br><br>Thailand has an aircraft carrier, its' so expensive to maintain, that it is kept in port all the time. Size isn't everything. UK explored deploying the Harrier on large container hauling merchant ships like the Alantic Conveyer (later sunk by exocet). It was deemed that such deployment was impractical and had marginal benefit.<br><br>Problems like refueling, repairs, routine maintenance plus navigation equipment, weapons systems support (targeting data entry) etc make deploying aircraft on an LST a fool's dream (or a cockmanie idea dreamt up by airchair genrals).<br><br>with a V/STOL aircraft runway length is not an issue but without the support, deployment will spread your assets without corresponding benefit of coverage, depth or sustainability. Even an off-site airfield on land takes up a lot of precious assets and preparation. The key to air operations is tempo which is either sustained by closeness to target, loiter time, haulage (for bombs) and turnaround time. The biggest secret in RSAF is aircraft availability and sortie rate.<br><br>This thread sound like a previous experiment to deploy our 155mm on another platform (before the current Primus program) which failed spectacularily.</div>
