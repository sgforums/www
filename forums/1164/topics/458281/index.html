              Saw this being advertised on the History Channel.  Malaysia's Special Forces ranked to be the best in Asia.  Did they get it wrong?  Comparison with Singapore's Special Forces?

              <p>If Malaysia best special forces, then DPRK must be most fanatical.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: medium; line-height: normal;"><strong>Special Forces</strong></p>
              <p style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: medium; line-height: normal;"><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">North Korea has the largest special forces, 120,000 troops, in the world. </span></strong> These troops are grouped into light infantry brigades, attack brigades, air-borne brigades, and sea-born brigades - 25 brigades in total.  These troops will be tasked to attack US military installations in Korea, Japan, Okinawa and Guam.</p>
              <p style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: medium; line-height: normal;">North Korea has the capacity to transport 20,000 special force troops at the same time. North Korea has 130 high-speed landing crafts and 140 hovercrafts. A North Korean hovercraft can carry one platoon of troops at 90 km per hour.  Western experts pooh-pooh North Korea's ancient AN-2 transport planes as 1948 relics, but AN-2 planes can fly low beneath US radars and deliver up to 10 troops at 160 km per hour. North Korea makes AN-2s and has about 300 in place.  In addition, North Korea has hang-gliders that can carry 5-20 men each for short hops.   </p>
              <p style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: medium; line-height: normal;">North Korea has developed special bikes for mountain warfare.  Special forces use these bikes for fast deployments on mountains. Switzerland is the only other nation that has bike-mounted special forces trained for mountain warfare.  The rugged terrains of the Korean Peninsula are ideally suited for special forces operations.  North Korea's special forces will attack US targets in Japan, Okinawa, and Guam as well. Japan's self defense units are being reorganized to counter this threat.   </p>
              <p style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: medium; line-height: normal;">How good are North Korea's special forces?  <span style="text-decoration: underline;">In September 1996, a North Korean submarine was stranded near Kang-nung and the crew were forced to abandon the ship and land on South Korea.</span></p>
              <p style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: medium; line-height: normal;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"> The sub had two special forces agents who had finished a mission in South Korea and were picked up by the sub before the sub ran into a rock.  <strong>The two men fought off an army of South Korean troops and remained at large for 50 days, during which they killed 11 of the pursuers. </strong></span></p>

              From what I've read, the North Koreans special forces are in some ways, like the Spartans of Ancient Greece.  School children who show good aptitude for military training are separated from the normal school stream at a young age and sent to military school.  The best are than sent to be trained as special forces.   Its the same thing they do with sportsmen in China, your school children are judged and sent to special sports schools at an early age in order to produce Olympic champions.
              
              Actually, the History channel documentary misses out some of the more gory bits of the Commando training.  During the escape and evasion module, the trainees are shown being punched in the torso and stood on whilst lying down.  Actually, it's worse than that, they are actually tortured until they actually spit blood.  But they learn that type of training from the SAS module.  The SAS used to train with the Commandos for their jungle phase, although officially, its now supposed to be held in Brunei.  Read Andy Mcnab's autobiography "Immediate Action" where he tells of his jungle warfare training the Jungle Warfare school in Johore during the late 1980s.
              
              I also heard from a former Malaysian Commando Captain, that for their live fire training, they make it more interesting by having collecting everyone's shit and urine for a few days, than pouring it over the live fire area prior to crawling over it during the live fire exercise.
              
              He also told me that never ever mess about with a Commando after he just completed a training module.  They are so hyped out during the training, they tend to fly off the wire with the slightest provocation.  Even the officers treat them with kid gloves during such periods.
              
              There's no question that Singaporean military equipment are by far much better and sophiscated than that of the Malaysian military.  However, as the Americans found out during the Vietnam War, no matter how sophiscated and first world your weapons are, you can still loose to an enemy who is well trained, determined and prepared to die for their cause.  As General Patton said "Wars may be fought with weapons, but they are won by men."
