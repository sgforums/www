We are also facing the potential MLRS attacks and the proliferation of ballistic missiles, therefore this Net-Centric Airborne Defense Element (NCDE) may be suitable for our use.<br><br>When this technology matures, we can modify our F-16 to fire these modified AIM-9X and AIM-20 AAMRAM missiles.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"><br><br></div>

The F-15A went into a Mach 1.22, 3.8 g climb of 65Â° and released the ASAT missile at an altitude of 38,100 feet (11.6 km). The F-15A computer was updated to control the zoom-climb and missile release. The third test flight involved a retired communications satellite in a 345 statute mile (555 km) orbit, which was successfully destroyed by sheer kinetic energy. The pilot, USAF Major Wilbert D. "Doug" Pearson, became the only pilot to destroy a satellite.[31][32]<br><br>The ASAT missile was designed to be a standoff anti-satellite weapon, with the F-15A acting as a first stage. The Soviet Union could interpret a U.S. rocket launch with a spy satellite loss, but an F-15 carrying an ASAT would blend in among hundreds of F-15 flights.<br></blockquote></div>

But seriously I donÂ’t think they are keen to please me. Of course MINDEF purchase and procure based on what they deem as the most probable threat. But who is our most probable threat by MINDEF definition?<br><br>In your scenario, if there is a serious clash between the Indians and the Malays in the HDB estate next to yours. That should not trouble you at the moment. But, if you only tell your concerns to you Indian neighbors instead of your malay neighbors, then you are taking side already. If you even preparing pig blood against the most probable threat to your family, and if this is known, you would be turning your imaginary Â“most probable threatÂ” into a real and Â“definite threatÂ” even within your own HDB estate.
