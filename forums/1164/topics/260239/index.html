            <div class='col-md body'>The fact that Guards and other infantry units practice amphibious ops is actually a good indication that SAF might eventually field a Marine-type unit.<br><br>Instead of the opposite as some see it.<br><br>Being a specialilsed Marine unit is a whole different ball game from infantry units doing the occasional sea borne assault by little assault boats.<br><br>The Guards will eventually be strictly heliborne like the US Air Cavalry.<br><br>Both the Guards and the Marines of the future will constitute our Rapid Deployment Force, which I am guessing will be our doctrine in the near future.<br><br>SAF had been preaching Forward Defence for decades. Well, you can't "Forward Defence" if everyone is going by land.<br><br>So, a heliborne and seaborne RDF will be the instrument of that policy. Some go by air, some go by sea, and the rest of us go by bus No. 11.<br><br>Depending on just heliborne is also not enough cos heliborne forces are not heavy enough.<br><br>So you would need to land men and heavy equipment by sea the old-fashioned way.<br><br>And that's a Marines job.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>for some reason I doubt that is SAF direction, mindef will have to invest on more asset to support such an outfit. I think right now they are focusing on joint strike.  if the intention to establish unit like marine to be peace keeping deployment it has to involve civilian gov, and not sure if SAF can substance  peace keeping deployment and maintain all other SAF functions equal i think it would tied down too much resources.  Lastly, GST might go up again.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Good point about the limitations of yearly intake manpower.<br><br>But if you look at the big picture, we have at least 350,000 men (including reservists) in uniform upon mobilisation. Surely, there is a way to get 2 battalions of Marines out of this number?<br><br>Even if we start with just one combined arms Marine battalion, after a few intakes we will have several Marine Battalions including the reservists.<br><br>But as the Marine Battalion reservist age, they can be downgraded back to regular infantry status so we don't need to maintain too many Marine Battalions as they need a lot of assets.<br><br>The focus in future will definitely be on making units as mobile as possible. Getting there fast is sometimes half the battle won.<br><br>Regular foot soldier infantry units are becoming a thing of the past. Especially with our dwindling manpower, all combat units would eventually have some specialised roles or at least end up being mounted or amalgamated into some combined arms brigades or divisions.<br><br>SAF becoming 3G surely is more than just adding a few computers here and there. The whole SAF will shrink in size but will increase in firepower, protection, sophistication in personnel, tactics and equipment - as well as mobility etc etc.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Although we do not have dedicated official marines in SAF, we already have similar elements within the current ORBAT.<br><br>The 'rumoured' ADF is an all regular battalion which have rapid deployment capabilities such as using LST. Our current Guards outfit have a mixture of heliborne and amphibious assault capabilities (eg Super Pumas with LSV and AMX-10). Not to mention the NDU from the navy which sends soldiers for SEAL training in the US regularly.<br><br>As someone have mentioned earlier, the term Marines is offensive in nature and thus not used due to political reasons. But if you ask me,we already have 'marines' within SAF. Should one day Singapore government have the political will to assert Singapore as a regional military power then they can easily reshuffle the various units currently within SAF to form a new Marine formation.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>PS....can somebody explain why is it that people keep posting that NDU is to be considered as Marines? The way I see it...they do diff. things from say Marine Spec.Ops ie. Marine Force Recon. They chart waters, clear underwater demo., collect soil samples to see if a beach can be used to land tanks, trucks, clearing underwater obstacles such as iron pikes, tank traps etc...or can be used the SEALs are used in Gulf War 1 creating a diversion by means of a mock landing on a beach etc.</div>
