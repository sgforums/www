            <div class='col-md body'>Erm.. what definition of Marines are we referring to? Do note that the US's idea of a Marine Corps has undertaken quite a fair bit of transformation. In some ways they are the "Guards" (in our sense) of the US armed forces, but they do retain their abilities to assault beaches. They are largely an offensive unit, and don't really take and hold territory, unlike the US Army.<br><br>If we refer to the Royal Marines, then yes, the NDU is a somewhat similar unit, but the Royal Marines are more extensively equipped than the NDU and actually do heavy assault with vehicles. They are Naval Infantry. Whereas the NDU is largely a commando force. The Russians do have naval Spetnaz. They even operate T-55s I believe.<br><br>I do not think we can advance that sort of level, as one might note that they often have a support of a helicopter carrier, like the HMS Ocean.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Actually, what I foresee in the future is that a rapid response task force with marine capabilities being formed. It is abt the side of a strengthen brigade and has its own elements of fire support eg, artillery guns mounted on vehicles, some amphibious armoured elements.<br>To think that SAF might want to invest on another formation is not likely. Firstly due to the reduction of birth rates and if u observe the trends, now infantry do what Guards do more or less. SAF emphasis on multi role rather than specialise........<br>But the idea of a Marine force is not impossible. Firstly some of the GDS folks already specialise in amphibious operations and have trained extensively on this trade for 2 yrs of their service. Furthermore, we already have most of the systems already in place, eg. LST, FCU. Some may say GDS are mainly air mobile in nature and not amphibious. Yes, to a certain extent, but one must be aware that USMC also place heavy emphasis on heli-ops. Times have changed, I doubt any general will want his troops to storm the beaches like Iwo Jima, thus I believe USMC also have moved away from this type of operations and emphasize on heli ops and small scale coastal insertion.<br>What differentiates us from our neighbours is that we have a vision and we work towards it, while they only emphasize on countering what others have bought. I believe those AMX-10, ACV-1 did not come by accident, but rather like the Challenger subs, to help us familiarize and increase our expertise on this field on naval insertion. If u notice we got only 4 LST while 6 vessels make up a squadron in RSN. Thus I believe in the future, we may accquire large resupply vessels or even LPH like the Korean Dokdo LPD.<br>As for the fact we have a large supply of M113 available, we can turn them into amphibious like what the Italian have done. These armoured carriers can increase the speed for our troops to secure vital positions on the beach heads.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I agree with what equlus84 said. SAF probably will want a multi-role air/land/sea capable Rapid Response Force consisting of regulars, which they may form taking elements from existing units (commandos, Guards, NDU etc) don't know what they'll call it. We probably don't need marines for war against our neighbour in the north, but if we have to fight against other countries, marines would be useful, since you have to cross a sea.<br><br>Another question, if they form the marines, is how far are they going to go with it. If we are going the indonesian way, then you don't need much in terms of vehicles and ships (we already have them). But to go big-time seriously (such as middle powers like the Spaniards and Italians with naval task forces), you need:<br>1. Dedicated vehicles such as AAV (Amphibious Assault Vehicle) and hovercraft - Bionix/Ultras won't do, need something capable of going from ship to shore in all sea states, day/night and speedily.<br>2. Ships - at least 2 LPDs much larger than Endurance class (&gt; 15,000 tons). Marines typically have multiple means of insertion - via sea or air. So, the LPDs should be able to handle several Super Pumas or even Chinooks at one time to launch a substantial force (not one at a time like our LSTs). Also, since our 4 LSTs are not always availble (transporting for the army in overseas deployments), we need dedicated LPDs solely for Marines so they can be deployed anytime.<br>3. Destroyers/frigates and subs to escort these LPDs (perform anti-submarine, anti-air, anti-ship roles). Currently if deploying in bluewater, only our stealth Frigates and subs can fill this role.<br>4. Resupply ships. In US Marines task forces, you have replenishment ships to carry anything from fuel to ammo and food. A foreign analyst of RSN says RSN won't acquire resupply vessels due to the implied nature of their role - too offensive, for force-projection only.<br><br>A more realistic goal may be to follow the Australians. They are acquiring 2 Mistral Class LPDs (from DCN): 21,300tons "amphibious assault, command and power projection ships" by 2012.<br>http://www.naval-technology.com/projects/mistral/</div>

SAF probably will want a multi-role air/land/sea capable Rapid Response Force consisting of regulars (not reservists), which they may form taking elements of various existing units (commandos, Guards, NDU etc) don't know what they'll call it. We probably don't need marines for war against our neighbour in the north, but if we have to fight against other countries, marines would be useful, since you have to cross a sea.<br><br>Another question, if they form the marines, is how far are they going to go with it. If we are going the indonesian way, then you don't need much in terms of vehicles and ships (we already have them). But to go big-time seriously (such as middle powers like the Spaniards and Italians with naval task forces), you need:<br>1. Dedicated vehicles such as AAV (Amphibious Assault Vehicle) and hovercraft - Bionix/Ultras won't do, need something capable of going from ship to shore in rough sea states speedily.<br>2. Ships - at least 2 LPDs much larger than Endurance class (&gt; 15,000 tons). Marines typically have multiple means of insertion - via sea or air. So, the LPDs should be able to handle several Super Pumas or even Chinooks at one time, to launch a substantial force (not one at a time like from our LSTs). Also, since our 4 LSTs are already transporting for the army (overseas deployments) part of the time, we need dedicated LPDs to carry/deploy Marines full-time.<br>3. Destroyer/frigate-type warships and subs to escort these LPDs (to perform anti-submarine, anti-air, anti-ship roles). Currently if deploying in bluewater, only our stealth Frigates and subs can possibly fill this role.<br>4. Resupply ships. I'm thinking big on this one, but in the US marine task forces, you have replenishment ships to carry anything from fuel to ammo and food. i read a foreign analysis of RSN - they say RSN won't acquire resupply vessels due to the implied nature of their role - too offensive, force-projection type.<br><br>A more realistic goal may be to pattern it after the Australians. They are acquiring 2 Mistral Class LPDs (from DCN): 21,300tons "amphibious assault, command and power projection ships" by 2012.<br>http://www.naval-technology.com/projects/mistral/</div></blockquote>A large fleet U will need air support.  What would be the logistics support needed to maintain such a deployment.<br><br>From what i see, SG will send out SAF within ASEAN states if trouble arises. These will include islands around Indo, and possible Phili,  Thai to the North.  Beyond this region i am not sure how much would SG will commit.<br><br></div>

SAF won't send out large forces betond ASEAN. It would be hard to justify a fleet the size of Australia's future navy with 2 LPDs. And then add Harriers + maybe AWACS for fleet air defence.<br>Another thing is unless your country is like the US with global commitments/aspirations/hegemony (whatever you call it), chances are the LPD is only used once a year for exercises. Real war (touch wood) or natural disasters are just too rare here to justify their purchase.</div>

No country will want to sell its flagship (loseface)<br>2. No country will allow us to use their airbases to stage an attack on foreign soil. Our airplanes on Thai soil will be grounded in times of war, OR allowed to fly back to Singapore soil. BUT NOT stage an attack from there and fly back there. Doing that will be tantamount to stating that Thailand is Singapore's ally in the war, and Thailand will leave itself open to attack.</div>
