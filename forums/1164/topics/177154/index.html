            <div class='col-md body'>Yep, while insisting that China should built up their military sufficiently only for their true defense needs on page 29 of the report, while they streamline and expand their special forces to enforce their global interest - which is the whole entire world. While increasing their defense budget by 15% ..... for exceeding their true defense needs to extend their interest.<br><br>Great ....</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by maggot:</div><div class="quote_body">Why America should decide what build up is for China? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_confused.gif" alt="Confused" title="Confused"> </div></blockquote>come on now, truthfully, you knew the answer don't you ?<br><br>For me, I believe that China does present a challenge to the US global hegemony and dominance.  Merely to rise as a new major economy power itself is kinda challenge to the US dominance. Once china's done, it's off to the next target - India. Notice, that if anything should occur in the world.. US would wanted to be consulted first and for approval ?<br><br>For all they hope was that China's military should only be armed with spears, they armed Japan like a mini Britain of the Asia, even though they were not even allowed an army.<br><br>Also, "The China Threat" were used traditionally and conveniently for military budget approval after the close of the COLD WAR. But the manner where it is employed is unnerving... why ?<br><br>Well, I have been surfing foreign forums for years. And the China hatre from young Americans are serious... not only are they misinformed and violence inclined.. they are further fuelled by bias media and equally hostile teachers in their schools. Many still thinks China is a backward country filled with baby killers (true to an extend, but not in a way they are presented), torture regime ( as if US flared much better), commie pigs , all the people are seriously oppress, invaders, a threat to the world security, nuke them is a common phrase used unrestrained and anything China is stumped on.<br><br>Yeap,... US has developed a war culture... that anything not agreeable will be met by the awesome power of the US army. I'm not exactly anti-US, but when you read such uneducated comments. It does make me wonder why should I trust US dominance, who have a habit of force issue on other people, making unfair deals with Thirld world countries instead of truly solving their real needs. I guess an unstable countries makes more profitable deals. BTW, I have do have issues with bias BBC, too, when it comes to China's issues.<br><br>BTW, I suspect the Beef imports from US are also forced upon us, altough no news as such, but the timing where South Korea, Japan and Singapore do coincide... also We have just sent a LST to Iraq.... sure arouse my suspicion. Not to mention the chewing gum and homo sexual issue from the past.<br><br>Anyway, whether china is a threat or not for America, it's just a matter of attitude, what's America's attitude towards china? if America sees china as a threat, treat china as a threat, then china will be a threat, but if America sees china as a partner, then china will be a partner.<br><br>In my opinions, the world will be a better place if we have more than one player! actually i hope Euro could be another player, we will be much safer in a balanced world,where all country is 'restrained'.<br><br></div>
