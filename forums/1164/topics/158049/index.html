            <div class='col-md body'>Wondering what sort of booby-traps are employed by SAF? Below are a few which i read about,<br><br>(1)Read and watched movies of Vietnam War ear about how they actually rigged a thin fine piece of wire across a doorway to a grenade's safety pin and when some unsuspecting trooper storming the place accidentally trips across the wire, he would be actually pulling out the pin, and thus arming the grenade, and in a few seconds, it will explode killing and maiming those withing the area.<br><br>(2)Burying a grenade halfway below soft sand and placing an object,such as a map case, or a rifle over the arming lever and then burying it back,before pulling the safety pin out.And if any enemy trooper who fancies what he sees,reaches for the item and lifts it,the lever will be released and KA-BOOM!Killing and maiming again.<br><br>(3)Placing a claymore mine under debris near a doorway, when the assault team stacks up and is ready to move in, the claymore is detonated,sending steel ball bearings into the projected area killing and maiming again.<br><br>(4)Pungi pits most used by VC and NVA during VietWar, consisting of specially constructed pits which are filled with sharpened bamboo spears. The top of the pit is covered with camouflauged so as to blend with the ground. Any unsuspecting trooper who falls into the pit will instantly be SATAY. The bamboo spears are sometimes smeared with faeces to make the injury infected.<br><br>thats all i know of, do feel free to share more!Thanks!<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Many methods to construct a booby trap. Can also be done using everyday stuff you can buy from shops. Don't know who's reading this (including children?) who might copy or experiment. So i think we don't get carried away and discuss this in public domain.

It's not done this way.<br><br>The grenade's safety pin is removed and the grenade carefully placed into a tin can mounted horizontally about ankle level. A wire is then then stretched across the path with the loose end attached to the grenade.<br><br>The can has to somehow be the right width to fit the grenade without the lever being released but loose enough for the grenade to move out easily.<br><br>So simple, so effective. Of all the booby traps, those using hand-grenades are the easiest to make. However, these are best for indoors or confined places. The most boobytrap casualties are still from proper landmines or those made from unexploded arty shells.<br><br>Another is they would carefully put a greande with pin removed under a dead GI or even one of their own VC when they have no time to retrieve the body. Other GI's who comes to examine or retrieve the body gets it.</div>
