There isnÂ’t really a hard definition of Â“operational levelÂ” scale. The term is generally used to describe anything in the gray area between strategy (overall conduct of a war, including non-combat factors such as industrial production) and tactics (the details of the actions of small units). If your primary focus is the battlefield, it isnÂ’t strategy. If you canÂ’t smell the smoke, you arenÂ’t really dealing with tactics. Think of the operational level as a view of the battlefield on a scale just exceeding that at which differing ranges of various direct fire weapons are significant."</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I agree, it gets a bit confusing sometimes when we think too much.<br><br>Its an operational decision since they figured the Ardennes would be defended lightly as the French believed attacking through the Ardennes with motorised forces to be impossible.<br><br>Yet, it can be argued as a strategic decision (when approved by Hitler). The Maginot line coupled with the Dyle Plan presented a formidable defense on a broad front. The strategic deliberation that in order to avoid a prolonged war, they needed to annihilate the allied troops quickly and completely.  And for that to happen, they have to outflank the entire allied front, and traverse along it with secondary attacks/feints on Belgium and Holland.</div>

Would you agree with this example?</div></blockquote>Yeah, close enough I guess.<br><br>The strategic objective is probably closer to "starve the enemy of war supplies, materials and equipment, reducing morale and forcing them to surrender."<br><br>Operational decisions would probably be to reach and hold a particular enemy industrial centre.  Subsequent decisions and observations may sound like, "by attacking and holding the few certain towns, we can create forward strong points and supply areas to mass and punch through the enemy defenses that are likely to be concentrated along the avenues of advance to the industrial centers."<br><br>Tactical decisions may sound like, "As there are limited/ constricted approaches to xxx town, we may require heavy artillery and air support to suppress the enemy while attacking from the forest with dismounted troops and along the road with mounted forces."<br><br>I'm not an expert in this field, but this is what I gather from some of the material I have looked up.  Decisions at which ever level will no doubt impact the rest of the levels, especially at the Strategic level.  Sh!t rolls down the hill. =)<br><br>Though they are hard to tell apart sometimes, I guess it can be observed when  the decisions are actually implemented.  Generally, a tactical decision should support an operational objective, and an operational decision should support directly or indirectly a strategic goal.<br><br>But for lay folks like myself, I prefer not to get confused by all this.  If the decision is made by the President, or Supreme Commander etc, its a Strategic Decision.   If its made by some smaller generals and colonels, its Operational.  Majors and below, Tactical.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"></div>
