Up to 100 combat aircraft are planned.<br><br>Though Fitzgibbon hasnÂ’t gone as far as saying Australia should buy the Raptor, in the election campaign he said that Labor would ask Washington to lift the ban on sales so Canberra could reconsider its options.<br><br>The Australian Defense Dept. strongly prefers the cheaper and more flexible F-35 over the F-22, whose design emphasizes air combat. The department is likely to present Fitzgibbon with the same advice now that he has become its minister.<br><br>The U.S. Congress reaffirmed the ban on F-22 exports as recently as July. Japan, which is keen to buy the aircraft, responded by launching development of its own stealth fighter demonstrator (AW&amp;ST Sept. 3, p. 24).<br><br>Rudd plans to pull Australian troops out of Iraq, but only after consultation with the Iraqi government and with the U.S. and Britain. He may decide simply to switch emphasis from Iraq to Afghanistan, following BritainÂ’s lead.<br><br>Moreover, thereÂ’s no other sign that the new government lacks commitment to AustraliaÂ’s U.S. alliance. Rudd, a Mandarin-speaking former diplomat, has always voiced unusually strong support for the alliance, and he lists it first among the three pillars that support his defense policy. (The others are active membership of the United Nations and comprehensive engagement with AustraliaÂ’s neighbors.)<br><br>Any changes in procurement policy are most likely to appear in a planned review expected next year.<br><br>Â“The new defense white paper will address the requirements for the ADF to deploy more units at higher readiness levels, deploy at shorter notice [and] sustain operations for longer periods,Â” according to the official Labor policy statement.<br><br>The defense budget has been expanded by 3% a year above inflation since 2001, and Labor says it will stick to that policy at least until 2016.<br><br>But Australia is planning significant new capabilities for its armed forces while renewing old ones. Analyst Mark Thomson notes that the budget is more stretched than generally realized, saying Â“the new government will find that there is not enough money to do all the things the previous government planned to do.Â”<br><br>Thomson, of the Australian Strategic Policy Institute, says the budget will buy new capabilities but doesnÂ’t have the funds to sustain them. For example, it will pay for six Boeing Wedge*tail airborne early warning and control aircraft, based on the 737, but thereÂ’s no additional money for their running costs.<br><br>The same goes for extra NH90 helicopters that Eurocopter will build in Brisbane and a pair of 27,000-ton assault ships to be supplied by SpainÂ’s Navantia.<br><br>Thomson expects that the Defense Dept.Â’s habitual slowness in getting projects to contract might cover the gap. If it doesnÂ’t, he thinks the government, awash with cash amid a strong economy, will probably allocate the extra money.<br><br>LaborÂ’s policy largely avoids mentioning specific equipment requirements, but two programs for the Royal Australian Navy are emphasized.<br><br>One is that Labor wants to get an early start on preliminary work on replacements for the navyÂ’s six Collins Class submarines, even though none of those boats is due to leave service before 2025. Local construction will be necessary, Labor says, partly because an off-the-shelf design wouldnÂ’t fill future requirementsÂ—meaning it wouldnÂ’t be big enough to deliver the necessary range and weapons load.<br><br>The new government also describes an order for a fourth air-defense destroyer as a Â“strong option.Â” Local contractor ASC has been tapped to build three of the 6,250-ton ships to a design by Navantia. Former Defense Minister Brendan Nelson, now leader of the opposition, says a fourth unit would cost A$1.5 billion ($1.3 billion)Â—an extraordinarily high figure for a production design, indicating the great premium paid for local development and construction.<br><br>The new government doesnÂ’t appear likely to drop support for local industry, howeverÂ—most notably, shipbuilding.<br><br><a href="http://www.aviationweek.com/aw/generic/story_generic.jsp?channel=awst&amp;id=news/aw120307p2.xml&amp;headline=New%20Australian%20Government%20Wants%20to%20Consider%20F-22s" rel="nofollow">http://www.aviationweek.com/aw/generic/story_generic.jsp?channel=awst&amp;id=news/aw120307p2.xml&amp;headline=New%20Australian%20Government%20Wants%20to%20Consider%20F-22s</a></div>
