            <div class='col-md body'>Sardaukar,<br><br>u have a point, but in wartime, its not hard to de-humanise the enemy and to dis-regard all the considerations u brought up.<br><br>out in the field, there's really no room for an overly-developed sense of morality... u watched band of brothers recently? the second episode i think... when the american soldier bayonets his platoon mate cos he thought it was the enemy...<br><br>thats exactly the kind of pressure soldiers face in the field. u're tired, cold, wet and miserable. very scared. anything that moves makes u jump and u'ld rather shoot first and ask questions later. a joke during the gulf war was that the most dangerous fire was friendly fire cos its so much more accurate... and why's that so if soldiers are indeed, thinking clearly out field? cos they aren't... things are simply moveing too damn fast.<br><br>besides, you would've also been instructed that everything in front of you is the enemy... and its a perfectly logical reasoning if u're advancing into hostile territory. if u don't react first, u'll be killed. the other guy would certainly not give a second thought to pumping u full of copper or lead.<br><br>so in the field, u're not killing the enemy to protect your country, your're not killing somebody else's son, husband or father. u're neutralising a threat to u and your fellow soldiers.<br><br>and because things moves so FAST out field, u have no time for a morality debate. in that context, it is a much greater sin if u let your men, or your comrades down by not taking out the enemy first.<br><br>once the first shot rings out, your training and your instincts takes over... and thats not an exaggeration... nothing else matters. its just u, your weapon, and everything else that lays before u is a target.<br><br>if anyone wants to be pure and not kill, they should do it in their own time in the confines of a monastry. out in the field, u have no business thinking that way because lives are at stake. not just yours, but many others as well.<br></div>

Just to clarify, I was talking about having these thoughts while waiting for THE call to be made to the COS office.  Once the shooting starts, hell, it's a free-for-all and it's kill or be killed.  However, during the prep, when you know it's not an exercise, it does give you a reason to do a bit of soul-searching.<br><br>At the end of the day, the military is but an instrument of policy.

            <div class='col-md body'>The training is as tough as you want it to be. If you want to get into the Commandos, Guards or other elite units and be pushed to your mental and physical limits, just ask. Tell the MO at CMPB when you go for medical classification and your PC in BMT. If you have what it takes, the SAF will definitely oblige.<br><br>I would not say that the training today is "less" than in the past. The recruit of today is physically weaker and less used to hardship than the recruit of the past, but he learns faster and is better disciplined. The SAF has adapted. The recruit of today would probably collapse if subjected to the tender graces of the Israeli advisors of the past. The recruit of the 1960s would be lost with all the technology and procedure he needs to learn today, and be a headache for his commanders. The training is just as tough, just tough in a different way. Different formations and vocations are also very different in terms of what they expect from the soldier.</div>

Being the big boy doesn't guarantee that you'll make it - I've seen guys built like an ox drop five klicks into a mission, while the skinny little guys just keep going.  I've also seen national junior bodybuilding competitors drop to their knees and bawl like babies during morning runs.  One of the guys in my section weighed 46kg, and he carried 48kg on LRRP missions, and was machine gunner on assault missions.  Watching the guy do a clean fatigue jump was always entertaining for my company - we would be on the ground and he would be still going like a yoyo with every updraft. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green">  Still, there was no doubt about Eddie's toughness.<br><br>A good part of it is in your head, and the rest is how you prepare and adapt yourself for times when you have to be on the go through all kinds of weather for 5 days, with the rare 15 minute catnap during resupply breaks.  With the possible exception of the duration, I believe this applies for all combat arms.<br><br>At the end of the day, what makes all the difference is your ability to keep your head under all circumstances.  I'm sure a lot of us will be familiar with the question, "What, shack cannot think, right?".</div>
