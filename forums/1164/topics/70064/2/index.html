            <div class='col-md body'>Hmm - personally I don't know of any such volunteering system - despite my best efforts, I got selected.  Maybe things have changed over the years.  Some of the guys from my batch are pretty senior (I've just heard that one of our boys is slated to become the new CO), so I'll ask about it.<br><br>Again, maybe you're right and Commandos have gotten softer over the years (although I'd prefer it if you wouldn't use the word "crap" ), but I'd be leery of any claimed differences between the toughness of Guards and Commandos.  Often, Commando officers are posted over to Guards units for their OC and CO tours, so there's a lot of crossing-over of cultures, and there would be similarities in standards.<br><br>By the way, SOF is an all-regular unit.  The others you mentioned take NSF soldiers.<br><br>I'd have to agree very strongly with 12qwaszx here - your current mindset is pretty dangerous.  Certainly in the battalion, and knowing my mates in SOF, the ones who made it did not think that way.  Instead, we all focussed on being professional: it's a job that not everybody can do, and we take pride in doing things the best we can.  Simple as that.<br><br>No offence, but I certainly wouldn't want to go on a mission with someone who had the mindset you've portrayed - that kind of guy is the type who gets his mates killed.<br><br>From a civilian point of view, if you want to see the right mindset, watch the last episode of Band of Brothers, "We Stand Alone Together: The Men of Easy Company".  It's a documentary containing interviews with men of the 101st Airborne Division in WW2.  Listen to what these men have to say and pay attention to what they focus upon - it's not how tough you are, but how you stand by your mates.  All the best!</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Like Sardaukar, i also would very much like to be part of an elite unit. Its heartening to hear from people like him, because i've seen many people complaining wanting to 'geng' as they call it to get a easier vocation no matter what. Although i'm not yet gone through my ns and don't know what exactly it feels like in military life. But i doubt i can enter an elite unit like commando and stuff...poor eyesight and fitness.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Sardaukar, you can express your willingness to join an elite unit during evaluations. This does not guarantee that you'll get in, but it improves your chances greatly. There are still psychological, physical and character evaluations that you need to pass, along with manpower requirements. However, if you MUST be in an elite unit, you should simply sign on as a regular in the unit you want. If you pass selection you will automatically be there.<br><br>Before you do that, however, you need to ask yourself several things, as others in this thread have said. Life in these units is TOUGH. Tough in the Army means a whole different thing from tough in civilian life. It is not glamorous once you are on the inside. It is not at all like what you see on TV or the movies. Make sure you know what you are getting yourself into before jumping headfirst into it. Do a bit of NS first, then decide.<br><br>Mindset wise, you need to ask yourself WHY you want to join these units. If you need to join to validate yourself, to give yourself something to be proud of, you are already in trouble. Nothing can make you proud of yourself. You seem so boyishly enthusiastic that I am a bit worried. The best soldiers are usually the reluctant ones. I will leave it up to actual Guards and Commandos (like Gedanken) to tell you what constitutes a good mindset for someone in their units.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I have finished my soul searching and will say this.I will fight for my country.I wish to join the elite units for the prestige partly.I feel no shame in admitting this.I wish to serve my country as something morer than a mere infantry soldier,though that is a respectable vocation.That is my ambition<br><br>As for ego,unashamedly,yes,I join partly for ego.I will serve my country in whatever capacity if I am posted even to a non elite position.though preferably a combat vocation.I will fight beside my comrades and give the mission first priority over my life.If it is for the greater good of the nation,then yes,our lives are secondary to all other objectives.A mission first,all else is secondary.<br><br>As for pride,I have pride in what I feel is my heritage as a Singaporean and as a Chindian.I just wish to do my duty.I am if anything,determined to go through with the tough training,as I am determined to show people what Singaporeans are capable of,even the weaket of us.For if you serve in the SAF,I feel you should take pride in what you do.You are protecting your society,your people.For some,you are given a chance to redeem yourself and contribute to the greater good of Singapore.As a soldier,you are representing yourself to the world as a defender of your nation.In these turbulent times,soldiers are needed more than ever and it saddens me to see people trying to skive off and just cruise through their service.Previous generations before us have gone through it to defend us.If not for them,we would not have the security that we have now.We owe it to them,to our descendants,to our future generations,our families,to serve in an honourable institution that is not perfect but I feel does its best to do its duty,to defend a society that takes it for granted.<br><br>I also wish for a return to the training standards of the 60's or 70's,well,to match the israeli's in their toughness for training.Safety is all very well and good,but sometimes accidents happen and they cannot be avoided all the time.We need mentally and physically tough soldiers,disciplined and intelligent,who can hang with the best of them.I mean come on,air-con barracks?Give me a simple tent.Throw us into tough training and we will pull through,Singgaporean men must either adapt or show their weakness to their comrades.<br><br>At the moment,for most NSF's it seems to be just a game,but living in our part of the world,it is highly turbulent.To the west,Aceh is embroiled in war.To the north,rebellious Muslims are being cleansed by the Thais.To the west,Mindanao seeks independence frm Manila.The JI have sought to bomb us,Muslim traitor residents of Singapore who would kill their own people to achieve their aims.Their loyalty should be to their country,NOT Islam.The Koran states that you must put your country above your religion.And of course,there are those threats that are covert and won't be revealed,to avoid panic.We should throw the TSR to the air and forge new training standards that equal those of the Israelis,to have tougher PT and harder living conditions in the barracks,to conditions ourselves.We must train as we would fight.<br><br>I explicitly state that only some extremist Muslims are responsible.From my view,most Malays are loyal to Singapore and would make good soldiers.It is in their heritage.I just feel that the JI terrorists who are Singaporean should be charged with treason and left to contemplate their deeds,the betrayal of their homeland,before being shot through the head.Traitors like them must pay the highest price.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Erm, OK.<br><br>I'm going to ascribe this to a matter of expression, but this talk about shooting people in the head and throwing TSR into the air really does worry me a bit - it's all very trigger-happy.  The last thing I'd want to do is go on a mission with someone like that - either he'll get me killed or we'll have a repeat of My Lai.<br><br>At the end of the day, it's a job.  Certainly it's an honourable job, and certainly it needs to be done right, but you will not be encouraged to take too high a level of view, because in the big picture, you are simply the instrument of government policy.<br><br>All you really need to do is focus on doing the job right.  Regimentation was certainly not a major part of the Commando mentality when I was there, and we that probably made a major contribution to our reputation as being poorly disciplined.  We took breaks whenever we had a chance, but when it came time to switch on, we switched on all the way.<br><br>Our second OC went on to become Force commander for SOF, and his understanding with us was that he would treat us as professionals as long as we made sure we got the job done, and he turned our company into a highly efficient machine - we turned out the best platoon of what was the best combat unit for that year.  Some time after he returned to SOF, we got a company 2i/c who converted from Armour, and man, was he ever a boy scout with regimentation.  It turned out to be a disaster - he brought along his bullsh*t-baffles-brains approach, and of course the boys didn't appreciate it - the company's efficiency went all the way downhill because we had too much bullsh*t to take care of.  Hell, even the CO didn't like the guy.  Eventually, though, he learned to shut up and stop with the jingoistic chickensh*t nonsense, and the company ran fine after that.<br><br>There was another guy in my platoon, an old schoolmate of mine, who had a similar mentality as well, and he was so caught up in it that nobody could work with him.  He made it through to get the beret, but when we went operational, he was relegated to rear-echelon tasks.<br><br>The worrisome thing, Sardaukar, is that what you've written sounds a lot like these two guys.  Remember, it's all about the job, being professional about it and making sure that when the time comes, you can do it right.  Leave the rest of it at the door.<br><br>Ego?  Of course there's ego involved - I doubt that the SAF ever had a man who put on a red beret and was completely unaffected by it.</div>

They were gambling the night before and kept losing. Frustrated they went to sleep. One of them,the one sleeping below felt very cold at night. Woke up, put on long 4 cover blanket from head to toe and try to sleep but cannot cause he still felt very cold.  Then out of the corner of his eyes he saw a figure standing just beside him. Bobian, he forced himself to sleep. The next morning, the fellow on top asked him if he felt anything or seen anything. They confirmed it and went to tell the CSM about it. He just told them to hang their berets on the bed.  Nothing happens after that.<br><br>2) This happened after our company orded and the new batch of recruits came in.  Apparently in a same bunk, a recruit was posessed and started talking in another voice. Things were finally settled after the CSM step in to 'negotiate'.<br><br>3) There were of course sightings of flying burning objects outside the window and a recruit waking up to see figures in FBO standing by bed in the bunk.<br><br></div>
