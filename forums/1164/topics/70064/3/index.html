If you gone thru ASO you will know what I'm talking abt.<br><br>Many folks claim that if ever any conflict between both countries they will not fight, they claim that chinese will not fight along malays or chinese(in malaysia) regard themselves are second class citizens hence will not fight. I think they are all being very naive.<br><br>When you see your friend killed or yurself being shot at, you will not fight?<br><br>When you see your house/neighbourhood all that you built up bombed and gone up into dust you will not get angry?<br><br>Will you not do anything if your family is starving or no water to drink?<br><br>If I see that in happen in singapore sure I will get very angry and if I ony had a stone in my hand still I will fight &amp; so will all malaysians unite if it happens in malaysia.<br><br>In every country there are hawks and doves, we can only hope that the doves win more often than the hawks.</div>
