              <h2>Australia Pushes Radar Technology Boundaries</h2>
              <div class="info">By Gregor Ferguson <br>Published: 20 October 2008</div>
              <p>Sydney - The Royal Australian Navy may be the world's first to take
              a fourth-generation active phased-array radar to sea when a
              preproduction sensor participates in a naval trial in the Indian Ocean
              next month. In addition, concurrent ship upgrade programs will improve
              the combat capability and survivability of its existing fleet of FFG-7
              and Anzac-class frigates.</p>
              <p>The
              Navy will mount a CEAFAR radar, manufactured by CEA Technologies,
              Canberra, aboard an Anzac-class frigate in a final risk-mitigation
              exercise before the system is retrofitted to the entire fleet of eight
              Anzac frigates. An earlier prototype had been evaluated at sea in 2005,
              but next month's trial will be the first of a fully digital
              fourth-generation radar with production-representative power levels and
              signal processing algorithms.</p>
              <p>Testing of CEAFAR production radar
              arrays has commenced on the rooftop of the CEA Technologies facility in
              Canberra, said Ian Croser, technical director at CEA Technologies.</p>
              <p>The
              rooftop testing will be immediately followed by an at-sea demonstration
              on an Anzac-class ship, using a specially designed mobile dual-face
              configuration.</p>
              <p>"We have diverted significant resources and energy
              into this extra at-sea demonstration opportunity at the request of the
              DMO Project Office, but we consider the extra benefit is worth the very
              tight schedule and the risk that this presents," said Croser.</p>
              <p>"This
              demonstration has taken advantage of an early alignment of equipment,
              software and Anzac class ship availability. This presents an additional
              but important risk mitigation opportunity."</p>
              <p>The CEAFAR S-band
              search-and-track radar and its adjunct CEAMOUNT X-band target
              illuminating radar form the core of the 778 million Australian dollar
              ($539.3 million) anti-ship missile defense upgrade of the Navy's Anzac
              frigates under Project Sea 1448 Phase 2B. The first ship set of
              production radars will be installed aboard HMAS Perth in January 2010.</p>
              <p>Because
              they handle crossing as well as head-on targets, the CEAFAR/CEAMOUNT
              combination will increase the Anzacs' self-defense capabilities as well
              as their ability to protect other ships around them.</p>
              <p>The CEAFAR
              sensor is much lighter than existing search-and-track radars and its
              beam can be steered rapidly or focused to overcome jamming and clutter.
              The CEAMOUNT target illuminator can also shift its beam rapidly from
              one incoming target to another, ensuring each target is illuminated to
              guide an Evolved Sea Sparrow Missile to intercept it, while continuing
              to track other targets.</p>
              <p>This provides the ships with multiple
              channels of fire; at present they have only one, provided by their
              mechanically steered Saab 9LV illuminator.</p>
              <p>The Anzac fleet is
              undergoing a series of upgrades, including the installation of Harpoon
              anti-ship missiles, a torpedo defense system, mine- and
              obstacle-avoidance sonar, a Sagem infrared search-and-track sensor and
              an upgraded Saab 9LV Mk3E combat management system to handle the higher
              data throughput.</p>
              <p>A former Navy director of maritime development,
              retired Commodore Paul Greenfield, said the Navy "will be very
              impressed by the capabilities of the Anzacs' new weapon system,
              including the radars."</p>
              <p>CEAMOUNT's fourth-generation technology
              clears the bottleneck created by mechanically steered target
              illuminators, which limit the number of targets a ship can engage
              simultaneously, Greenfield said.</p>
              <p>Fourth-generation radar
              sensors are all-digital, Greenfield said, and each of the 1,024
              transmitter/receiver modules on the antenna face can be controlled
              independently, allowing the use of different wave forms to overcome
              jamming and background clutter. In the future, with the right
              processing capabilities, fourth-generation radars will be able to
              function as high-capacity data links or control UAVs.</p>
              <p>Only two
              companies, CEA Technologies, of which Northrop Grumman owns a 49
              percent stake, and Lockheed Martin are developing fourth-generation
              sensors, Greenfield said. CEA is working under a 21 million Australian
              dollar research and development contract from the Defence Material
              Organisation (DMO) to develop high-power active phased-array radar
              technology u<span style="color: #ff0000;">nder the joint U.S.-Australia AUSPAR radar research
              program, launched in 2005.</span></p>
              <p>Meanwhile, the Navy is expected during
              the week of Nov. 18 to formally accept the first three of four
              Adelaide-class FFG-7 frigates upgraded by Thales Australia, here, under
              a 2.1 billion Australian dollar contract. The fourth ship should be
              accepted around mid-2009, said Chris Lloyd, Thales project director.</p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">The
              upgrade is two years behind schedule but will extend the lives of the
              FFGs to 2021 and increase their point and area air defense
              capabilities, pending their gradual replacement from 2015 by three new
              Aegis-equipped Hobart-class air warfare destroyers. </span></p>
              <p>The three
              ships accepted next month - HMAS Sydney, Melbourne and Darwin - will be
              fitted with the new Australian Distributed Architecture Combat System
              (ADACS) developed by Thales Australia. The first naval combat system
              developed entirely in Australia, it includes a new electronic warfare
              and torpedo defense system, and an upgraded fire control system, the
              Mk92 Mod12, which will control both the Evolved Sea Sparrow Missile and
              the Standard Missile-2. <span style="color: #ff0000;">This is the first time either missile has ever
              been installed aboard an FFG-7 frigate. </span></p>
              <p>The Standard Missile-2
              will be installed next year under a separate contract, according to Mal
              Adams, the DMO's FFG upgrade project director.</p>
              <p>The ADACS also
              includes a Link 16 tactical data link terminal, the first ever
              installed aboard an Australian warship. This will enable Australia's
              FFG-7s to exchange tactical data, including radar and other sensor
              information with allied ships and aircraft as well as the Royal
              Australian Air Force's F/A-18 Hornets and Super Hornets, its Boeing 737
              Wedgetail early warning aircraft and with its new air defense
              command-and-control system, code-named Vigilare.</p>
              <p>Link 16 isn't
              in service elsewhere in the Navy, so Thales and the Navy validated its
              performance earlier this year with the help of a visiting U.S. Navy
              destroyer equipped with Link 16. â– --EOQ</p>

              <p>he'd try to prop it up as a wow, australia is doing something right. and next, he'd slam them hard on not being able to intergrate their systems properly or screwing things up.</p>
              <p>and @ lionnoisy :</p>
              <p>in case you havent realized, STK dosent integreate much. DSTA handles the army IK2C intergeration projects (A.K.A software), with STK usually handling the "hardware" aspects.</p>
              <p><br>take a look at the Primus (which in case you have no idea , means<em> FIRST</em> in latin, aptly reflects the product nature) STK handled the joining of the turret with the chassis of the Bradley.<br><br>DSTA handled the integreation of the BMS and customizing the FCS for our usage.</p>
