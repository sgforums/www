            <div class='col-md body'>The Indonesian government have just went to the IAEA of the UN to inform them of their intention to have nuclear power stations by 2015.The idea have been around since the Suharto era but it was never implemented due to strong protest.It is possible to make nuclear weapons from the nuclear waste, depending on the type of reactor they are planning to get. What are the implications of this decision to the future defence of Singapore? And how will it effect the SEA region and beyond?</div>

Especially in a country as large as indonesia. </blockquote>IIRC, indonesian forest fires only became a significant problem after the downfall of Soeharto.  Forest fires could not be eliminated but could be minimised.<br><br>Anyway, Indonesia is party to the non-proliferation treaty and none of their neighbours have any nuclear arms nor any intention to develop them. Hence, to start development of nuclear weapons in this region just do not make any sense.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br>They have also in the past indicated intention to develop peaceful use of nuclear energy. Due to their large population and declining reserves of oil and gas, it makes sense to develop alternative sources of energy.  I don't believe there is any need to read too much into this.<br><br>IMO, we are more vulnerable due to ever increasing cost of fossil fuel and total dependence on imports. Further, we suffer from scarcity of land to develop alternative energy sources. For instance, where could we safely locate a nuclear plant if we had wanted to construct it?<br><br>There may be some concern only if the nuclear plants are located close by. In the event these are located close by, the Malaysians will also raise objection.<img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>In my opinion, the possibility of Indonesia developing nuclear weapons after their power plants when ready is low. At least not in the next 30 years from now (assuming they start constructing straight away).  I don't think they have the money,technology and political will to do so. I think they want nuclear power stations so that they will be less dependent on fossil fuels.

That would be a better offence.<br><br>Come to think of it, I can't come up with a country that has survived a nuclear attack without massive loss of life.<br><br>Like I said, its not that we are afraid that they would build nuclear weapons.  Its not cheap nor easy to do so.  But its whether it would cause another chernobyl type incident or not.  Plus, it would be placing fissile material within the grasp of rogue forces such as terrorists.  A dirty bomb alone can cause quite a bit of damage.</div>
