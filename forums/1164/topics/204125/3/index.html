If a rocket would  travel 600km, it would be considered a tactical ballistic missile rather than a mere Surface to Surface missile - which usually have the a more restricted 100 to 300 KM range and have cruise missiles like flight profile.</div>

At that point of time i haven't personally seen the article yet, which is why i ask for the article itself in my opening post. I don't understand exactly what they were discussing in malay but they were discussing about this, therefore i presume these are mentioned in the article itself.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong><a href="http://www.strategypage.com/messageboards/messages/512-23284.asp" rel="nofollow">Ukraine develops 'smart' rockets for Singapore Jan /9/2006</a></strong><br><blockquote>JANE'S NAVY INTERNATIONAL - JANUARY 01, 2006<br><br>Ukraine develops 'smart' rockets for Singapore<br><br>Michal Zdobinsky<br><br>The Luch state design bureau in Ukraine is developing a 2.75-inch 'smart' rocket for Singapore, writes Michal Zdobinsky. It will negotiate the transfer of technology and manufacturing rights for the homing and steering module to Singapore, allowing local companies to manufacture the module and convert existing 2.75-inch unguided rockets that can be used to arm Singapore's helicopters.<br><br>The upgrade uses technology derived from a Ukrainian programme to develop a guidance and control module to convert the 80 mm AP-8 unguided air-to-surface rocket into a 'smart' AP-8L guided round. The AP-8 is an improved Ukrainian derivative of the Russian S-8 unguided rocket.<br><br>The Ukrainian programme to develop the AP-8L was initiated by the Ukrainian Ministry of Defence, and work started at Luch at the end of 2004. The modified missile has a new front section, containing a laser seeker and a steering unit with two flip-out aerodynamic control surfaces. It retains the rocket motor of the standard AP-8 rocket. The laser seeker of the AP-8L is adapted from an existing weapon, JMR was told, but this weapon was not identified.<br><br>Installation of the new front section increases the length of the rocket from the original 1,586 mm to a total of 1,725 mm. To partially compensate for the new hardware, the warhead was trimmed in weight from 4.7 kg to 4.3 kg. Despite this measure, the AP-8L weighs 14.7 kg, 2 kg more than the unguided rocket.<br><br>Like the AP-8, the AP-8L can carry either a high-explosive (HE) or a shaped-charge (HEAT) warhead. Although the latter is lighter than the original pattern carried by the unguided rocket, the performance of the shaped charge was enhanced to preserve its armour-piercing capability, matching the older warhead's ability to penetrate 400 mm of homogenous steel armour.<br><br>AP-8L rounds can be launched from the standard 20-tube B-8M-1 rocket pods, or from the similar B-8V-20A pods intended for helicopter use. They can be carried by aircraft such as the Su-17, Su-22, Su-25 or the MiG-27K, which carry the Klyon-PS laser rangefinder/designator. Other types of aircraft or helicopters would have to be fitted with suitable laser target designators.<br><br>According to the Luch design bureau, all the main components of the AP-8L are tested and proven, but at the IDEF 2005 defence show held in Ankara, Turkey, in September 2005, the bureau indicated that live firing tests of the complete missile had yet to begin.<br><br>Until these have been conducted, neither the declared effective range of the new weapon, given as 1,200-5,000 m, nor the claimed 70-80 per cent hit probability against a tank or armoured personnel carrier target can be fully proven.<br><br>In parallel with the AP-8L programme, Luch is working on the upgrade scheme for the 2.75-inch rocket, <strong>a project being financed by Singapore. According to the deputy director general of the Luch design bureau, Georgiy S Petrov, Singapore would be able to use virtually any laser designator, with only a minor modification to the radiating frequency being required to match the new weapon. Petrov believes that the development and testing of the guided 2.75-inch rocket will be completed by the end of 2006. 	</strong></blockquote><br><br>one small misssile, one kill of APC,tank etc is a good secret weapon indeed.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I was thinking........wad is the difference between guided rockets and missiles? I mean if we master the technics to making 2.75 inch rockets does this mean we can produce larger calibre land based rockets like MLRS? Does this mean we may master the skill to make indigenious missiles like that of at least a VSHORADS. I made this comment as we are license producing the IGLAs. Furthermore, since we have a mechanised IGLAs with a radar unit..... Does this mean with have mastered "black technologies" of some aspects of missiles? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_question.gif" alt="Question" title="Question">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"></div>
