              <p>ahhh, my valuable contribution would be this ?</p>
              <p>why raise this fact ? its an empirical piece of data, 18 astros were acquired in addition to the existing 18 in service. its undisputed and its hard to disprove that they dont exist.</p>
              <p>point being is WHY ? you present this fact for a purpose, an intent, an agenda which you are in posession of.  the fact is a mere extension of knowledge and knowledge is not value free. knowledge is something that we take, use and apply meanings to it.</p>
              <p>and so you present your agenda quite clearly now, which is a why singapore should justify its defence purchases. which is inevitably going to lead to a moronic chest thumping rah rah singapore monologue by you.</p>
              <p>which really brings us full circle to the question that remains unanswered ?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>whats the meaning of this thread ? </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>its the quintessential problem with you. at its core, your intent/meaning/signficance of what you do is highly suspect. flawed even. nullifies your "contribution" (which really is more like reporting in the sense of copy pasting and stealing content you dont own. rather than definitive "contributing", which is to add value to a particular aspect and engage in positive development for the benefit of the collective whole. ) your existence operates at a very superficial level. merely surface deep. to call it skin deep would be a stretch.</p>
              <p>scratch beyond that thin veneer, and we see the "REAL" you. the conflicted, angst ridden, attention seeking, australia bashing, mindless politcal dogma worshiping noisy lion. dig even deeper and what do we find ? really, someone who has alot of internal mental conflicts, like your 3 photobucket accounts with all the junk and small snippets of information. really quite phathetic imo.</p>
              <p>and if you'd like, thats my meaningful contribution, rebuffing whatever nonsense you comment by analyzing what you are. deconstructing you as my text.</p>
              <p>ever heard of this poem ?<span style="white-space: pre;"> </span></p>
              <p>tiger tiger burning bright ?</p>
              <p>this is a part of it that quite describes you (albiet satirically) </p>

              I cant remember the exact details but i have an inkling that over 1000 of the SS-30 127mm were purchased. That's a 9-30km range rocket (most accurate of the lot of course). In the first deal.
              There were also several hundred of SS-40(180mm 15-35km)&amp; SS-60(300mm, 20-60km).  Not sure but i think the SS-80(300mm, 22-90km) if bought were quite few.
              
              SS-09 32?/launcher (trainer HE-Frag, 4-10km)
              SS-30 32/launcher(HE-Frag)
              SS-40 16/launcher(cluster warheads)
              SS-60/80 4/launcher(cluster warheads)
              
              
              6X6 light armoured truck with HMG and smoke dispensers.
              
              Cluster Payloads are DPICM, HE-I/HE-Frag, AP/AT munitions(mines) and runway denial up to 400mm of reinforced concrete
              
              The first purchase consists of 18 AV-LMUs(launcher), 18 AV-RMDs(resup, 2X full load), 1 AV-VCC(Bn comd), 3 AV-PCCs(Bt comd), 3 AV-UCFs(fire control unit), 2 AV-METs(field repair) and 3 AV-OFVEs(weather/met mobile station)
              
              Other munitions payload available(maybe purchased but not announced??):
              
              SS-150 ??-150km? range?
              FOG-MPM - Fibre optical guided multi purpose missile - yup what it says. About 40km max range 180mm so you can fit 16/astros II
              Tactical missile - 150km-300km you know what boom boom.

              <p>Unconfirmed reports suggest that the original purchase included 1000 SS-30, 224 SS-60 and 576 SS-80 rockets.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>There's no confirmation that the SS-60/80 actually included cluster warheads and the signing of the CM treaty suggests these were unitary warhead types.</p>
              <p> </p>
