            <div class='col-md body'>Singapore holds the unfortunate title for the highest % of people suffering from myopia (four-eyes) IN THE WORLD.<br><br>More than Taiwan, Hong Kong or any other ethnic-Chinese places.<br><br>I, myself, needs glasses and I can't say enough how terrible this is for a rifleman.<br><br>With all the explosions, dashing about and falling around involved in battle, it is easy for your glasses to be damaged. And in the rain, which is often, my helmet brim helps keep the rain from completely fogging my glasses but not enough. And not to mention the lens of your glasses simply becoming filthy after a day in the field.<br><br>If my glasses get damaged during battle, I become a liability to my unit. I might mistakenly shoot our own guys and I won't be able to see clearly where I'm going. In other words, I cease being an effective fighter.<br><br>Now, imagine that more and more people need glasses in the future and this will be a very serious problem for SAF.<br><br>But inspite of all the 3G modernisation, SAF has not invested into researching "combat" glasses for SAF men.<br><br>If STK researches into this and come up with a solution, I think it will be a real winner and SAF will definitely buy into. Not to mention a great potential for atheletes and other active lifestyle people.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>If SAF force you to go for lasik, then as with all operations there is a risk, and someone op have complications how?  Parents will be up in arms, then Defense Minister must answer in parliment..  No I don't think it will happen.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br>They SAF used to offer some the ugliest black frame specs around for anyone who needed them.  No idea if they still do.  But no one wanted them as they made you look like a serious goondu.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br><br>As for the specs dropping and slipping off noses, that's why SAF actually suggest wearing those spec straps.. altho its not a popular practice.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>The best pair of specs I got cost me arounf SGD1,000.<br><br>The small rectangular frame is wire thin but is pure titanium, matte metal colour. So it is very flexible and very strong. The brand is called Air.<br><br>Although I've got rather severe myopia AND astigmatism, the special imported lens is very thin.<br><br>This pair of specs is so light, flexible and comfortable I can sleep wearing it.<br><br>I highly recommend it. Yes, it is expensive. But after more than 7 years later, I am still wearing it, and I will continue to wear it for years to come as long as I can find spare parts for the nose pad replacements.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>There is a misconception why certain combat roles does not allow for wearing of spectacles. It is not just for good eyesight. Specs can correct your eyesight to near perfect - or more than good enough for most combat things.<br><br>With specs, I get marksman bonus for my CTSS every time. So modern specs can correct eyesight to near perfect, but the original demand for perfect eyesight for pilot, armour. commando and naval roles had more reasons beyond just mere good eyesight.<br><br>It was originally deemed that these jobs/environments are unsuitable for the wearing of spectacles.<br><br>Even during WW2, the cockpits of aircrafts weren't airtight and pilots often needed to wear goggles. So you can't wear goggles AND specs at the same time. Or even in modern aircraft, upon ejection, your glasses will definitely fly off, or injure your eyes...etc.<br><br>For Naval personnel, the minute the wave splash over you on deck, glasses will be washed away. Or even if it doesn't, if your specs are wet all the time, you can't see shxt.<br><br>For tankee, because you are bumpiing against the interior of the tank all the time, crack your specs not just cannot see, but fragments may bling you.<br><br>For commando, no need to say, all the things you are supposed to do like parachuting, swimming underwater, etc etc... How to wear glasses? Or once glasses damaged, mission fail.<br><br>And I've tried wearing contacts in the field. DON'T.<br><br>It popped out, once. And I couldn't put it back into my eye. And my hands were filthy. How are you gonna put on your lens and take them out and wash at night when out in the field? No way.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Yeah, contact lense in the field is a definite no no.  Especially if its an extended exercise.  You might risk eye infection if u handle ur lenses with dirty hands.<br><br>I'm aware of certain lenses that can be put on for 30 days... if those do not pop out, maybe that one can be considered.</div>
