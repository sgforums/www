            <div class='col-md body'>I don't really see what the problem is ... I've worn specs all through my 2 yrs NSF and the last 11 years as an NSMen.<br><br>This is what I've been doing.<br><br>i) 3 pairs of specs.  1 pair, my "book out" pair stays in the bunk.  2 Pairs are my "field specs" go out with me into the field, 1 worn and the other as spare.<br>ii) The "field specs" are butt ugly but cheap and tough.  No gals going to see me so why do I care?<br>iii) The pair worn ... stays on at all times with spec bands.  If you don't take them off, they won't get run over by a rover ... if they do, then I'd be more worried about my head <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br>iv) I carry a cleaning kit with me in my SBO, anti-fog lens spray (which helps alot) and cleaning cloth.  I do maintenance on my specs like I do my weapon ... often.<br>v) I never wear contact lens unless it's a "clean" excercise with easy access to water, eg. NavEx or as controller ... and I only do so so that I can wear sunnies with my jungle hat ... okay so I care how I look <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"><br><br>In all those years, I've yet to break, lose or damage a pair ... so you can understand why I don't see what the fuss is about.<br><br>And that's also why the SAR-21 is a god-send for speccies ... can you say optical sight?<br><br>A cheaper alternative to the S$1000 Air Titanium would be the Silhouette Titan which goes for S$350 incl. polycarbonate lenses.  Light, strong and comfortable.  I've accidently worn them for field and sports without any problems.  Cuurent pair is on it's 4th year.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>My post was more directed at the various accounts of bad experience in the field by fellow posters.  I was trying to illustrate that a lot of the common problems faced by bespectacled soldiers in the field can be solved by simple preventative action.<br><br>Stuff like specs fogging in the rain, lens becoming filthy, specs keeps slipping, specs fogging when discharging weapon, breaking glasses outfield, specs getting run over, glasses bent out of shape ...  These are all situations that will repeat themselves whether in peace time training or wartime conditions.  If you can solve them in peacetime, you can solve them in wartime ... until you run out of anti-fog <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br><br>The only situation I can see as very different will be the concussive force of explosions and the increased amount of debris you will come into contact with.<br>Speaking without experience of a wartime environment, I can only guess that it again shouldn't be too much of a problem for most military vocations ... a sturdy pair of (butt-ugly) plastic specs with Polycarbonate lenses, good anti-fog and retaining strap should be fairly proof against most events that don't rip your head off.  I've used this combination for some very rugged (and wet) activities without problems.<br><br>Combat goggles are IMHO, nothing more than mil-spec workshop safety goggles.  Their primary role is not to provide indestructable corrective eyewear but to protect the "Optical Sights Mk1" from debris on the battlefield.  It'd be good to have but is not entirely necessary ... also, you CAN wear goggles over specs (do that all the time skiing)<br><br>I'm not trying to say that problems do not exist, just that they are not as bad as it's being made out to be.  Soldiers will break/loss their corrective eyewear somehow and will be less effective when that happens.  However, I feel that with proper habits, the problem can be minimized ... as an example, ever notice how some people are always losing their handphones/wallets but some don't?  It all boils down to habits and attitudes.<br><br>Oh .... have I mentioned optical sights?<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>ESS Ice is the model of the shades im using lar... *bish acwire*<br><br>ESS Ice also has RX-inserts where u can put a prescriptions on, and insert it behind the polycarbonate lense.  However, I do not reccomend ICE as a "combat" wear.  It does not secure fully around the face, (asian heads smaller?) as well as oakleys M-frames.<br><br>ESS combat goggles can be considered though.  They may be able to have the same RX-inserts behind the goggles.  The combat goggles provide a relatively wide field of vision.  Just that the RX-insert may narrow it abit.  Impossible to have the insert lenses as wide as the goggles i guess.<br><br>Still, it protects the user's eyes, and specs (rx-inserts) from debris, sand, dirty, fogging.  Unfortunately it migh cost a bomb too.  A user has to make new prescription lenses for the rx-inserts jsut for the goggles.  Is the SAF willing to pay that kinda money?</div>

What was more of a downer was that it was bloody uncomfortable, the rim of the goggle on the face (on top of camo cream) causing major itch and rash if worn for extended periods.<br><br>Speak to the scout riders and LSV guys, their experience would be more extensive and relevant.<br><br>I'd say that use of combat goggles in our environment is strictly for when the brown stuff's flying around ... all other times, goggles on helmet.
