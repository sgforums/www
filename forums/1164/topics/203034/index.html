            <div class='col-md body'>I don't believe Aust sees us as a threat to their National Security.<br><br>However, I believe the reason why we were grouped together with other 'heavies' (esp India &amp; China) and treated as a 'threat' to Aust and thus justifying a superior fighter for the RAAF boils down to simply - Aust psychic of being 'outgunned' by a fellow Asian AF (remember the similar civilian version of SIA plying the US-Aust route?)<br><br>You can argue this could be due to their past 'expired' White Aust policy or 'racism' but I'm not dwelling into that issue here.<br><br>Superior and formidable fighters represented by the Flanker-series being intro by regional AF eg Vietnam, India, China, M'sia &amp; Indonesia (&amp; possibly Thailand) is not just a course of concern for Aust but S'pore too esp when relations with certain countries blows hot-&amp;-cold (read Aust vs Indonesia &amp; S'pore vs <span style="font-style: italic;">'you-know-who'</span>) .<br><br>I sympathise with the RAAF dilenma with the impending retirement of their 'Pig' (F-111) and the inadequate performance of the Hornet to replicate effectively the roles that the 'Pig' plays, and the continual introduction delay of the F-35.  As they say here, there's a gap between the period from the Hornet until the F-35s introduction in RAAF.  And the proliferation of Flankers so close to Aust shores certainly may cause some sleepless nights for RAAF planners in Canberra.<br><br>However, the report does not do itself favors when it quoted this analyst Dr Carlo Kopp's anaysis and findings.  Kopp is pretty discredicted in Aust defence circles over a nasty incident but Kopp is perhaps more well-known as a strong advocate of F-22s for Aust and his phobia over the rise of Asia (vis-a-vis to Aust).<br><br>P/s.  It is pretty shocking to me that Aust even quoted us in this report.  Hello?  Has Canberra forgotten that we are (even though not on the level that Aust is) also involved in the F-35 program?<br></div>

And possibly as many as 70 F-16s, 60 super Sky-hawks and 49-50 F-5E.  Some analysts and reporters in some magazines assert that we have more F-16s though we will never know the actual figure.<br><br>We would need to augment the the retirement of the Sky-hawks with new NGFs though; which is why analysts are expecting a series of purchases similar to the F-16s. The upper limit for the NGFs is 60-80 aircrafts. It is highly unlikely that the latter figure has changed. The type of aircraft might change though i doubt it. Just wait and see.<br><br></div>

If a wheel could drop off...  It either means that the maintainence people screwed up.. Or more than likely high time the aircraft got replaced.<br><br>It might have made more sense for them to invest in a version of the F15E.  Instead of pinning all their hopes on the F35.  But then, the Australian government has never been too big on spending too much on defense if they could help it.</div>
