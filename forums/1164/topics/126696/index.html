            <div class='col-md body'>i spoke to a war vet on monday. he was a Bren Gun Carrier driver with the Queen's Royal Regiment. He told me, they'd just done D-Day, stormed up Gold beach, and a column of the BGCs were travelling down thru the Villers Bocage area and he was in the 3rd BCG from the front. They came to a set of crossroads, and then the lead BGC caught an 88mm shell from some german gun. There was a big boom, and the lead BGC simply disappeared, while the rest of them wheeled around and retreated. Later on that day, they'd have to go back and shovel up the chunks of flesh together and leave them at the side of the road for the burial parties coming up behind the advance units. To top it all off, they served stew for dinner that night.<br><br>A Bren Gun Carrier:<br><br><img src="http://www.spitcrazy.com/Bren-gun-carrier.jpg"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Service History<br><br>The original role envisaged for the Universal Carrier was for a fast, lightly armed vehicle to carry infantry across ground denied by small-arms fire and specifically, the Bren light machine gun and its team, hence the name Bren Gun Carrier. (NB: A broad parallel can be drawn between that concept and the tactics of the APC (Ml l3Al) Troop which carried an In fan try Company. Each infantry section, comprising ten men [one section to a vehicle] possessed a light machine gun crew of three men and a GPMG M60, cal. 7.62 mm).<br><br>There was only one version of this vehicle named the "Bren Gun Carrier" but whatever the task, the entire family of vehicles was known by its users as Bren Carriers. In fact, numerous copies of the original Bren Carrier were produced and these were commonly known as the Universal Carrier<br><br>The hull of these vehicles comprised a simple steel box with a motor compartment situated in the centre. In front, sat a driver and alongside him, a gunner. A radiator was mounted in a bulkhead between them, and the noise generated by the fan effectively drowned out any conversation between these crew members (NB: vehicles of this type were not fitted with any form of internal communications).<br><br>Behind the two crew, were two rectangular compartments, one each side of the engine, these were used to carry a variety of stores and/or personnel.<br><br>Loads varied, and it was common to find the Carrier employed in a number of roles e.g. carrying ammunition, infantry support weapons such as medium mortars (81 mm), medium machine guns (usually the .303 Vickers machine gun). They were also used for towing anti-tank guns and trailers.<br><br>Because it was fully tracked, it proved to be a reasonably good, cross country vehicle and it was both agile and very fast, for its time. It was controlled by a small steering wheel and steering brakes.<br><br>Carriers were used extensively in every campaign during World War II. Such was their versatility, that many of those captured by the German Forces in France during the Blitzkrieg' of 1940 were quickly put to use in patrolling and policing captured territory.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>mebbe we shud instead convert some of out M113 carriers and bionix to be ATGM configuration.<br><br>If it's to punch thru infantry positions we still have the AMX13, the M113 and Bionix carries the bushmaster cannon also good enough for punching thru infantry.<br><br>The M113's or Bionix with ATGM configuration could play a new role as more effective tank hunter killer ambush teams. For example able to deploy 1 or 2 machine gunners, sniper/sharpshooter and a section of infantry .... like what the irregulars did in chechnya.<br><br>The M113 will be a good getaway vehicle, a command post to call in arty fire also and a big broomstick for laying down a wall of steel.<br><br>The ATGM it carries will "tackle" any MBT that happen to be there.<br><br>but to make it even better strap a few foldable bicycles on the side of the vehicle, bicycles are quiet &amp; can do short range recon/sniper missions as well as emergency get away in case M113 gets blown to bits.<br><br>Not to mention bicycle can be used for going to nearby sarabat stall to buy teh tarik or kopi.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I have seen old pics of SAF AMX-13 tanks overturned....The commander is literally crushed and twisted in an odd shape....More scary is the thought of overturning into a water body! The pictures are shown to us to warn us to be careful when travelling in uneven terrain,this is because the tank is top heavy, can flip over very easily. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"></div>
