As it is capable of defeating low flying wave hugging missiles, it might have a secondary anti-surface capability (although i can confirm my stand) but i believe it is rather limited (like the Barak Missile).<br><br>The Harpoon Block 3 have a Anti-land surface capability but i have to say that despite all the hoohaa, it is rather limited also. I will say it is more for tactical harbour attack but not really for deep tactical or strategic strikes.</div>

Suggested Block 2 features included a GPS-aided INS, a radar seeker with improved ECCM and some SLAM hardware. The GPS/INS guidance would allow much higher precision in attacks on shore-based targets. The "Harpoon 2000"/Block 2 proposal was apparently not too well received by the U.S. Navy, and although it's possible that the designation RGM-84J was allocated to the missile, no development order came forward. However, Block 2 was developed for export as AGM/RGM-84L, q.v."</div>
