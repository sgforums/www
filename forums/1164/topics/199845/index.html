But the fact is it is only a simulation. Aircraft carriers can take a lot of damages. Even sinking one or 2 is not going to sink the whole USN !!!<br><br>Remember the industry might of the US, they will be able to repair or build new carriers.</div>

Maybe not ! Could be all related to taiwan submarine requirement which US promise to build 6 diesel sub for taiwan. Due to China pressure non of the current europe submarines manufacturing companies is willing to take up taiwan requirement of 6 submarines. US have promise to deliver on it, nowever they have stop building diesel sub a long time ago. One best way is to lease a sub and anoun to the world that it is use for training, while in fact they are studying it throughly to prepare the building of diesel submarines for taiwan.<br><br>Yep we score a direct hit against one of their missile destoryers without ..............<br><br>Wait a minute !!! what weapon did we use to score ? harpoon missile ...... @@@ ?<br><br>Friend, what so proud of hitting a USA destoryer with a make in USA harpoon missile, basically it is a US weapon scoring !!! So if US harpoon is so good, is USN overrated  ? of course they claim they have the best naval system in the world, you shot their destoryer with their harpoon missile. Isn't their harpoon missile good ?<br><br>Haha !!!<br><br></div>

If it is no good, it will not score the hit.</div>
