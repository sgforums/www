            <div class='col-md body'>They are never really 'champions' of human rights. They merely use human right abuse as an excuse to interfere in other countries' internal affairs. One recent example is the Guantanamo Bay detention camp in Cuba.<br><br>Economic and military might is the way to go in international politics. Without money and weapons, your country will be pushed around by others. This is the unspoken fact of international relations throughout the ages.</div>

The US realises the possibility of another front in the Far East is likely and no doubt gonna be very taxing on their military capabilities to handle since they are already very commited to the Middle East situation.<br><br>A few days ago, Israeli attack Lebanon, to "rescue" their captured soldiers, and cites Iran and Syria being likely to be involved.  The open attack on Lebanon demonstrates the ability and willingness to go to war if they deem it necessary. Coincidence that Iran also openly challenged the US in their decision to go nuclear.<br><br>I feel that the US is trying to send a signal to both North Korea and Iran.  Perhaps it maybe something in the tune of, "i'm stretched, but I'm not alone."</div>

Btw, if it is realli a C802 by the Chinese, it post as a new interesting dimension. Firstly, it would mean the Chinese have reached a high lvl of technological advancement in the arena of weapon making. Another point is that the Chinese QC is so poor that the missile did not explode as expected.</div></blockquote>Whether the missile was a dud or not is immaterial. It's the fact an opponent missile penetrated the defenses of an advanced Western warship. ItÂ’s interesting that excuses are made like the defenses were turned off. Interesting since the Israeli military is such reputed as being one of the most experience force in the world. They didn't see the enemy in possession of such hardware so their guard was down? Well how about the terrorist tactic of driving a small boat up loaded with explosives. Were they ready for that or caught their pants down X 2? I saw the video of supposedly the missile striking the ship at sea. It was night and that missile was like a flare shooting across the sky before you saw the explosion. If that's what it's like, at least no one on the ship saw that coming?<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>My sense is that even an unexploded C802 will carry more punch aka much more damage to the vessel than it has appeared. The C802Â’s 165kg semi-armor-piercing warhead with hundreds kg of unburned fuel could still be no joke to the SAAR 5Â’s slim body. The IDFÂ’s investigation reveals that the missile( C802) indeed has exploded but above the stern and caused a hole in the copter deck , the sailors are dead beneath the deck, the impact may suggest there were no Copter then or the copter would have taken the impact. The funny thing is in the below IDF investigation report, it said the sea skimming missileÂ” exploded above" but still can casue " a hole"...<br><br><blockquote> <strong>Navy probe blames faulty intelligence for missile ship hit</strong><br><br><a href="http://www.globes.co.il/serveen/globes/DocView.asp?did=1000114951&amp;fid=1725" rel="nofollow">http://www.globes.co.il/serveen/globes/DocView.asp?did=1000114951&amp;fid=1725</a><br><br>The Israeli warship's crew had only twenty seconds in which to identify the threat and respond.<br><br>Amnon Barzilai 20 Jul 06 17:18<br><br>An Israel Navy investigation into last Friday's strike on the missile ship "Hanit" has found that the only fault was the lack of intelligence that Hizbullah had Iranian C-807 missiles.

Hizbullah fired two missiles at the ship. One missile hit and destroyed a Cambodian vessel with an Egyptian crew sailing a few dozen kilometers from the Israeli missile ship.

            <div class='col-md body'>I think it is most probabily a C701 missile. According to China defense webby, these type of missile is helicopter mounted, much like the penguin MK2 missile. It cannot sink a large ship, but can force the enemy crew to abandon it's mission. BTW, since the ship is shelling the coastline at such close proximity, you can imagine ppl at the coastline already spotting them.</div>

Even so, the missile - fired by Hizbullah forces - killed four crew and inflicted severe damage to the ship's flight deck and steering systems.<br><br>Hanit, part of a force of Israeli naval vessels enforcing a blockade on Lebanon, was hit at approximately 2015 h local time on the evening of 14 July while approximately 16 km off Beirut. Two Noor missiles were fired from a coastal site: one struck Hanit aft while the second sank a Cambodian merchant ship 60 km off shore. The 12 crew of the latter vessel were all rescued. On paper, the Sa'ar 5 is well equipped to defend itself against the Noor threat, being fitted with the Barak-1 point defence missile system, a Phalanx close-in weapon system, the NS-9005 multibeam jammer and the Deseaver soft-kill decoy system. However, it appears that Hanit was caught unaware by the attack and that its self-defences were not fully activated at the time. At such short range, the missile would have only had about a minute of flying time from crossing the coastline to striking its target. It cruises at a height of 30 m or 20 m, then descends to a final attack altitude of 7 m or 5 m. Local sunset was at 1850 so the missile made its approach in darkness. Flying under turbojet power, it offered minimal visual signature to Hanit's lookouts. "We were not aware that Hizbullah possessed that kind of missile," admitted Rear Admiral Noam Faig, Israel Navy Head of Operations. "We are familiar with that missile from other areas, but assumed that this threat was not present in Lebanon."<br>The impact caused a fire in Hanit's aft section and caused substantial damage to the flight deck area, but was ultimately contained and the ship limped back to Ashdod. Its automatic fire-protection system closed up the rear section, where the four servicemen who died were trapped. "The crew managed to put out the fire and regain some independent sailing capabilities," said Rear Adm Faig. "Hanit lost its steering and we had to tow it with another ship until the crew partially fixed the steering."<br><br>Another Israel Navy source told Jane's: "It's true that the Sa'ar 5 could easily handle radar-guided missiles, but we were just not expecting this kind of short-range threat. It's a very painful blow, but it could have been worse if they had hit another section of the ship and sunk it." According to Major General Gadi Eisenkott, the Israel Defence Force (IDF) Chief of Operations, Hizbullah operatives received targeting information from the Lebanese Navy's radar station in Beirut. "That is why we destroyed all the radar stations along the Lebanese shore immediately after the attack," he said. Israel has accused Iran of deploying military advisers alongside Hizbullah to enable the deployment and operation of the Noor system - a clone of the Chinese C-802/YJ-2 'Saccade' radar-guided ASCM. "The Iranian Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps [IRGC] has maintained a constant presence in Lebanon's Baka'a Valley since the early 1980s," said a senior IDF source.<br><br>"They have been training Hizbullah and supplying them with advanced weapons. I can't determine for certain that IRGC personnel were present during the launch of the missile, but they have certainly supplied the Hizbullah with a top-end missile, providing them capabilities which many countries do not have.<br><br>"From now on we have to assume that every weapon that exists in Iran has also been supplied to Hizbullah in Lebanon," a senior IDF source told Jane's. "We are prepared for more surprises," said Maj Gen Eisenkot. Senior IDF sources were furious that the Israel Navy had not taken into account the existence of such missiles in Lebanon. "The air force has been flying in Lebanon as if all known threats exist there and taking all precautions," Jane's was told. "The navy should have done the same." By any standards, the C802 is not an easy missile to deploy clandestinely. Its launch crew would require extensive training, while the minimum convoy that would make up an operational unit would be a radar/command truck, a power-generating truck and a single launch vehicle. In the original Chinese system, all three are heavy six-wheeled trucks. The radar mounted on the roof of the radar/command truck only has a range out to the horizon, so a single battery would have needed knowledge of the approximate location of potential targets.<br><br>On 16 July, Israeli air and naval forces destroyed several Lebanese Army radar stations; Israeli press reports claimed that these had participated in the attack against Hanit.<br><br>Israel innovates for the asymmetric, jni.janes.com, 21.03.06<br>Jane's Strategic Weapon Systems, jsws.janes.com<br></span></blockquote></div>
