There is a rumour that a tunnel leads from here to Sentosa.<br><br>The Labrador tunnels and forts were also used to store the Mustard gas. The poison gas was not used because the japanese did not first use this weapon. Just before the British surrendered, they threw all the poison gas shells into the sea next to the fort in front of Keppel harbour.<br><br>Some shells were recovered after the war, some were washed ashore. You can bet some are still lying there, rusting......and one day, ..........arg.......<br><br>(ref : PETER ELPHICK-Singapore the Pregnable Fortress Pages 204 to 206)<br><br>Do you live in the area?..........<br><br>........have you bought your gas mask?<br>Are you prepared?<br><br></div>
