            <div class='col-md body'>There was actually a study done back in the U.S on soldiers who are mentally eager for combat.  It seems its unknowingly implanted in the soldiers' mind during trainning that the soldiers is indestructabale.  Trainning scenario with the soldiers always coming out as victors with almost no lost of life, boost a soldiers confidence very high &amp; then top that with the constant whoah rubbish, boost the soldiers' confident into beyond logic.<br><br>But then there are a number of troops who feel that all the trainning is useless if they do not get the chance to use their skill, to take the ultimate test of life.  The Army likes it this way that a soldier feels the need to fight because when the time comes, the Army believes these are the soldiers that would turn up for it.<br><br>As for elite soldiers, its about accomplishment &amp; not the need for war.  To them its a challenge of their ability to get the mission done &amp; get out alive.   Just like a skate-boarder who does all kinds of crazy stuns with the possibility of endangering thermselves.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hmmz, really interesting replies thus far... thks guyz for the opinions.. I got some things to add as well...<br><br>Juz ytd I tink, I saw on the news abt some conflict in the Palestinian region (I hope I'm rite cuz I didnt catch all of the words the newscaster said) where US (or was it UN?) forces were engaged in heavy firefights in urban terrain. A solid minute long video footage (although kinda blurry &amp; shaky) was taken by a person who's "in the shit" &amp; I can tell u.. The action is INTENSE.. The chatter of automatic rifle fire is continuous, and the filming guy even caught an RPG impact onlie 30-odd feet in front of him...<br>**URGENT**If anyone noes a link to view/download tis footage, PLZ SHARE!<br><br>How has tis footage I mentioned got to do wif anything wif the topic? well, apparently, during the footage, LOTS of soldiers were actually shouting "WooHOoo!" plus all the battle cries I guess.. I cant distinguish shouts of excitement or fear.. But Woohoo says it all eh? further emphasizes my pt of soldiers who relish combat I guess...<br><br>Honestly, wad do u guyz tink u will feel when u're "in the shit"? I presonally tink I will juz want to be at the back providing cover instead of at the front though.. Yes... It may sound like I humji, but it's better than retreating to not take part rite? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"></div>
