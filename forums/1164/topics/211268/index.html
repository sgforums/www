            <div class='col-md body'>In my eyes, a coup can never be morally right in the sense that its the military taking over a democratically elected government. However, the recent Thai coup has been a very different experience. From the looks of it, it seems to be a military stepping in to resolve a longstanding politcal crisis with little benefit to themselves personally. Therefore, under what conditions, if ever so, would a coup ever be considered morally right?</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Wonder what happen to the thai politics.<br>How come there is a crisis? Thaksin won the election legally with high votes. Much supported by most thai especially the poor. Other than some business issues and poor handling of thai south situation, he has done very well for thailand.

As for the king, a review seems like saying the king felt that Thaksin did not respect him so he kinda support the coup? If true then the king kinda...emmm....How come they not intersted in the bigger picture? Can another PM do a better job with thai south? But Thaksin made a big mistake to choose a muslim general. What a serious mistake. Hope thaksin and the king will patch up and throw that general into jail and sentence him life imprisonment  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_evil.gif" alt="Evil or Very Mad" title="Evil or Very Mad"> .<br><br>However the Thai coup is suitable for another T, Taiwan  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"> .

He has shut down TV stations and companies for that reason.<br><br>Also He did not make a big mistake choosing a muslim general. Heck this has nothing to do with the fact that the general is muslim. He selected that general to his position in order to get his friends and loyalist into certain powerful positions in the military. Namely commander of 1st Infantry Div which is responsible for the Bangkok area and 1 other general into position i cant really recall right now.<br><br>However the military was always warning him and infact all politicians to sort this out fast. However when Thaksin gave a list of promotions that elevated 1 of this friends into a position for the army group in charge of the Bangkok province and a few others into key positions, the military saw this as an interference and a blocking of the only check on the civilian government and thus we get this.<br><br>Is a coup ever morally right? yes why? Because sometimes those in power might not be good for the country. As for democracy, some countries and people actually CHOOSE not to have it though along the way they might change their minds and not be able to do a thing but that's beside the point.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>maybe those people who pass flower or food to the soldiers are wayang only, i.e. paid by the military. aiya lao ya gimmic lah.<br><br>If those who really think thaksin has done wrong, why can't they go ahead to sue him? maybe our press never report much about him that's why we don't know..... but again if he has really done that many bad things then as the PM of thailand our press should have reported enough just like that useless ah bian, at least suspect this and that... but not much, virtually not hear of.. other than our famous take over. When the thai were interviewed, those who are against him, keep saying the politic situation in thailand is stalemate, bad, heading nowhere... but hey, what about economy? are people starving? opposition gana lock up without reason? ban this and that??  Unheard of. At the end of the interview... still can't figure out what's wrong. Shuting down irresponsbile papers and stations are common. Which country especially aisa or third world country don't do that?<br><br>But there is one thing for sure, the thai king must have felt that thaksin is not giving him the respect and probably he felt threaten that by the way thaksin goes, sooner or later the king has no say in thailand besides attending parties  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"> . Of course this muslim general who is close to the king would like to help the king out. Perhaps thaksin should have slow down with the reform and pacify the king a little before implementing more change. But is all too late. A few good man is not easy to come by ... another one wasted.</div>
