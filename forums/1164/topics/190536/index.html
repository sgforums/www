Bush in Washington last month. Bush and Hu also discussed the prospect of broadening military exchanges.<br><br>Ge said it was important for Chinese and U.S. officials to deepen their relationship. The admiral invited Cao to send officers to observe a major U.S. naval and air force joint exercise in the Pacific in June, as a way of demonstrating the U.S. commitment to ``transparency'' in its military operations, he said.<br><br>In an interview aboard his plane en route to China on May 8, Fallon said he was disappointed the U.S. wasn't invited to observe a joint Chinese-Russian exercise last year.<br><br>Fallon also urged China to take part in a meeting of Pacific regional commanders later this year in Kuala Lumpur.<br><br>Fallon's discussions in China come amid heightened concern in Washington about the military buildup in the most populous country, which is also the fastest-growing major developing- nation economy.<br><br>A 2005 congressionally mandated annual report on Chinese military power documented an expanding arsenal of ballistic and cruise missiles, submarines and advanced aircraft. It determined that the Chinese People's Liberation Army ``is modernizing its forces, emphasizing preparations to fight and win short- duration, high-intensity conflicts along China's periphery.''<br><br>The U.S. assessment said if the trend continues, the capabilities of China ``could pose a credible threat to other modern militaries operating in the region.''<br><br>China puts its military budget at $35 billion this year, while U.S. officials have speculated the actual spending could be close to three times that amount.<br><br>Fallon noted that the U.S. and China could jointly ``solve some of those challenges that abound in the region,'' echoing a theme put forth by Deputy Secretary of State Robert Zoellick last year that China ought to behave like a ``responsible stakeholder'' in the world system.<br><br>``There is much that we can potentially do together,'' Fallon said.</div>

William J. Fallon, commander of U.S. forces in the Pacific, flashed what aides described as a broad grin as he sat in the cockpit of a twin-engine FB7 fighter-bomber, China's most advanced domestically produced warplane.<br><br><strong>"They had to drag me out of there,''</strong> <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">  recalled Fallon, a veteran carrier pilot, as he described the first such close-up look by a U.S. official of the modern two-seater that is scheduled to become a key part of China's air defenses.<br><br>Fallon's visit to China's 28th Air Division, based near Hangzhou, and his pilot's-view inspection of the newly deployed FB7 were high points in a week-long tour of Chinese military installations and meetings with senior officers, including Defense Minister Cao Guangchuan. In a windup briefing here Monday, Fallon said the visits marked a significant step forward in his drive to increase contacts between the U.S. and Chinese militaries as a way to dissolve suspicions and reduce chances that the two Pacific powers will go to war.<br></blockquote>To read more, click <strong><a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/05/15/AR2006051500413.html" rel="nofollow">HERE</a></strong></div>

The Guam execise can be monitored by naval and satelite ... not that they are part of it.<br><br>It may be a surprise to many that the US naval ships are very worn and have out of date propulsions and navigation systems which are 2-3 decades old and is manpower intensive ... only advancement are their weapon systems...
