              <p><strong>The SCO and BRIC
                  summits had a common agenda: working for multipolarity and a revamp of
                  the global economic and financial order.</strong> </p>
              <p><span style="font-size: xx-small;"> SERGEI KARPUKHIN/REUTERS </span><br> <img src="http://www.flonnet.com/images/20090717261405701.jpg" border="1" alt="" width="350" height="197" align="center"> <br><strong> BRIC leaders in Yekaterinburg on June 16. (From left)

                  Russia, Hu Jintao of China, and Prime Minister Manmohan Singh of India. </strong></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>IF there is a bright side to the global financial and economic
                  crisis, it is that<span style="color: #ff0000;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong> the devastating meltdown has spurred the rise of a
                  multipolar world. </strong></span></span>This reality was fully in evidence in Yekaterinburg
                  on June 15-16, where Russia hosted the overlapping summits of the
                  Brazil-Russia-India-China (BRIC) and the six-member Shanghai
                  Cooperation Organisation (SCO) led by Russia and China.</p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>The resolve to reform the United States-dominated world shaped the
                  agenda of both summits.</strong></span></span> A declaration released at the SCO summit said
                  that global “multipolarity is irreversible”. Likewise, the BRIC summit
                  stated its “support for a more democratic and just multipolar world
                  order based on the rule of international law, equality, mutual respect,
                  cooperation, coordinated action and collective decision-making of all
                  states.”</p>
              <p>Both the SCO and BRIC have made great strides in recent years, but
                  while the Shanghai group has been a formally structured regional
                  security organisation since 2000, BRIC, until recently, was just an
                  acronym coined in 2001 to explore the impact of the four fastest
                  growing emerging economies on the global power balance. In the past
                  couple of years, BRIC has undergone a fascinating transformation from
                  an academic concept to a full-blooded global forum.</p>
              <p>Exploratory get-togethers of the four nations’ Foreign Ministers on
                  the sidelines of the United Nations led to their first stand alone
                  meeting in Yekaterinburg in May 2007, followed by meetings of their
                  Finance Ministers and regular consultations among their central banks.
                  The 2007 summit institutionalised the group as a global political and
                  economic forum and the Second World’s alternative to the G8.</p>
              <p>Much has been said about the four nations having too many
                  differences and precious little in common. Sceptics have pointed out
                  that China’s gross domestic product (GDP) outstrips that of the other
                  three countries combined; that Russia is the world’s biggest exporter
                  of hydrocarbons and Brazil is a major source of farm products and other
                  commodities for the world, and that India is strong in services and
                  China is the world’s manufacturing hub. Russia competes with China for
                  influence in Central Asia and is uneasy about Chinese demographic
                  expansion into depopulated Siberia. India has an unsettled border
                  dispute with China and is nervous about China’s military rise and
                  support for Pakistan.</p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>However, the recent summit showed that the four do have a common
                  agenda – a revamp of the global economic and financial order. A joint
                  statement signed by Brazilian President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva,
                  Russian President Dmitry Medvedev, Indian Prime Minister Manmohan Singh
                  and Chinese President Hu Jintao called for an overhaul of global
                  financial institutions and sweeping changes to the U.N. to give a
                  bigger role to India and Brazil.</strong></span></span></p>
              <p>The BRIC states pledged to promote energy and food security, to
                  expand cooperation in “fundamental research and the development of
                  advanced technologies”, and to step up efforts for humanitarian
                  assistance. <span style="color: #ff0000;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>The statement stressed “the central role played by the G20
                  summits in dealing with the financial crisis” but made no mention of
                  the G8, sending a clear signal that the era when the world’s richest
                  nations set the global agenda was over.</strong></span></span> Interestingly, BRIC Foreign
                  Ministers had “expressed desire for continued cooperation” with the G8
                  a year ago.</p>
              <p>The BRIC nations defined their immediate goal as increasing their
                  representation in the International Monetary Fund (IMF), the World Bank
                  and other financial bodies. “The emerging and developing economies must
                  have a greater voice and representation in international financial
                  institutions,” the joint statement said. BRIC’s demand for a greater
                  voice is well grounded. The four nations account for 40 per cent of the
                  world’s population, nearly 20 per cent of global GDP, and almost half
                  of the global currency reserves. Jim O’Neill, chief economist of
                  Goldman Sachs, who coined the term BRIC, said recently that the BRIC
                  nations would overtake the G7 developed economies in terms of GDP in
                  less than 20 years.</p>
              <p>Despite their growing economic clout, BRIC nations hold barely 10
                  per cent of the votes in the IMF, against almost 17 per cent of the
                  U.S. BRIC leaders called for reforming the global finances to diversify
                  away from the dollar. “We also believe that there is a strong need for
                  a stable, predictable and more diversified international monetary
                  system,” the summit declaration said.</p>

                  of Russia. </strong></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Medvedev stated that the “U.S. dollar has failed to perform its
                  function” as the main reserve currency, and predicted the inevitable
                  emergence of new reserve currencies even if the process would take
                  time. He said that BRIC leaders had instructed their Finance Ministers
                  and central bank Governors to meet and draw up “the parameters of a new
                  financial architecture.”</p>
              <p>Member-states of BRIC are already taking practical steps to reduce
                  their dependence on the dollar. In the run-up to the summit in
                  Yekaterinburg, China and Brazil decided to settle mutual trade in their
                  own currencies without using the dollar, and a day after the summit,
                  the leaders of Russia and China said at a meeting in Moscow that the
                  two countries would work to switch part of their trade from the dollar
                  to the rouble and the yuan.</p>
              <p>The decision of China, Brazil and Russia to purchase $70 billion
                  worth of new multicurrency IMF bonds serves the same purpose. India is
                  also expected to join them. Russia further said that it could consider
                  investing its reserves in the financial instruments traded by BRIC
                  states on a reciprocal basis.</p>
              <p>The summit in Yekaterinburg was not a one-time affair as the four
                  countries agreed to institute interaction mechanisms. “We have agreed
                  to have close and regular contacts at the level of ministries,”
                  Medvedev said, mentioning the Finance, Agriculture, Trade and Economic
                  Ministries and the central banks. “This work will be coordinated by the
                  Foreign Ministries,” he added. The BRIC leaders agreed to hold their
                  next summit in Brazil in 2010.</p>
              <p>Like BRIC, the SCO nations drew inspiration from the global crisis
                  to strengthen their cooperation. At the Yekaterinburg summit, they
                  agreed to enhance trade and investment among member-states and with
                  observer countries. Apart from Russia and China, the SCO unites four
                  Central Asian states – Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan and
                  Uzbekistan. It also has four observers – India, Iran, Mongolia and
                  Pakistan. An SCO declaration adopted in Yekaterinburg calls for
                  speeding up large-scale projects in transport, communications,
                  logistics, trade and tourism, and innovation and energy-saving and
                  renewable-energy technologies.</p>
              <p>The SCO leaders said their goal was to turn Central Asia into a
                  “transcontinental bridge” between Europe and Asia by building new
                  transport corridors and modernising existing rail and motor roads. They
                  agreed to strengthen the security agenda of their alliance, adopting a
                  “Statute on Politico-Diplomatic Mechanisms of Responding to Situations
                  Threatening Peace, Security and Stability in the Region”. The document
                  has not been published, but it probably addresses the simmering
                  disputes between Central Asian states over energy and water resources.</p>
              <p>The SCO also approved a range of anti-terrorist documents: a
                  convention against terrorism; a programme of cooperation in combating
                  terrorism, separatism and extremism for 2010-2012, and an agreement on
                  training anti-terrorist personnel for the member-states. None of these
                  documents has been released so far.</p>
              <p>Afghanistan was high on the agenda of the SCO summit in
                  Yekaterinburg, as it was in all previous summits. The SCO expressed
                  “grave concern” over the worsening situation in Afghanistan and decided
                  to “intensify cooperation with the observer-states” and other countries
                  and organisations in combating the growing threats of terrorism, drug
                  trafficking and cross-border crime. Russia moved to further enhance its
                  role in settling the Afghanistan problem. In March, Moscow hosted an
                  SCO conference on Afghanistan and opened transit routes on land to
                  non-military traffic for the benefit of U.S.-led NATO forces in
                  Afghanistan.</p>
              <p>Medvedev announced the establishment of a trilateral group with
                  Afghanistan and Pakistan to help resolve the problem of terrorism in
                  the tribal zone. The problem of Afghanistan “cannot be resolved without
                  normalising the situation in several Pakistani provinces and without
                  destroying the terrorist dens there,” Medvedev said after meeting with
                  the leaders of Pakistan and Afghanistan separately and in a trilateral
                  format. Russia’s demonstrative pressure on Pakistan to curb terrorism
                  was sweet music to Manmohan Singh, who attended the SCO summit for the
                  first time. His presence at the SCO table was a big victory for Russian
                  diplomacy. Indian diplomats acknowledged that the Prime Minister had
                  accepted the invitation in recognition of Russia’s “special efforts”.</p>
              <p>At the previous SCO summit in Dushanbe in August 2008, Russia pushed
                  through a proposal to invite the heads of state and government of the
                  observer nations to closed-door summit meetings in order “to allow
                  their views to weigh in”. Russia has long favoured granting full SCO
                  membership to India, which received observer status in 2005 along with
                  Iran and Pakistan. China has so far opposed India’s membership, but
                  Russia has been patiently working to lift a China-lobbied SCO
                  moratorium on admission of new members. At the Dushanbe summit, the SCO
                  leaders set up a commission to work out admission rules. It has since
                  met three times and is reported to have circulated draft rules to the
                  member-states.</p>
              <p><span style="font-size: xx-small;"> SERGEI KARPUKHIN/REUTERS </span><br> <img src="http://www.flonnet.com/images/20090717261405703.jpg" border="1" alt="" width="307" height="300" align="center"> <br><strong> Asif Ali Zardari and Manmohan Singh met on the sidelines of the
                  SCO summit and agreed to resume diplomatic talks between India and
                  Pakistan. </strong></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>In Yekaterinburg, Medvedev called for speeding up the drafting
                  of admission rules. “The work is going on; instructions have been
                  issued, but we need to get this job done and come up with norms and
                  procedures so that we can set the ball rolling,” the Russian leader
                  said. Hu signalled China’s continued opposition to SCO expansion by
                  failing to mention the subject either in his speech in the plenary
                  session or in post-summit interviews.</p>
              <p>However, other SCO members concerned over China’s overbearing
                  presence in Central Asia openly backed the Russian stand. Emomali
                  Rakhmon, the President of Tajikistan, called for completing all
                  formalities for the admission of new members by the 10th anniversary of
                  the SCO in 2010. Even more important was the support from Uzbekistan,
                  which took over the SCO rotating presidency from Russia in
                  Yekaterinburg. “We consider it advisable… to expedite the drafting of
                  documents… for the admission of observer states as full members,”
                  President Islam Karimov said in his speech. “We are all aware this
                  question is not simple, but it must be solved step-by-step.”</p>
              <p>Outgoing SCO Secretary-General Bolat Nurgaliyev of Kazakhstan said
                  expansion of the alliance was “inevitable” given the interest of
                  outside countries towards the group. In Yekaterinburg, Sri Lanka and
                  Belarus were granted the newly established status of “SCO dialogue
                  partner”. On the way home from Yekaterinburg, Manmohan Singh said that
                  India was not only looking forward “to increased functional cooperation
                  with the SCO”, but “would welcome” an invitation to join it as a
                  member. “But I am not lobbying for it,” he added. Probably he should if
                  India is not to lose Central Asia to China.</p>
              <p>Yekaterinburg marked a new phase in China’s economic expansion in
                  Central Asia. Hu announced China’s decision to give $10 billion in
                  credits to Central Asian states to help them cope with the global
                  economic downturn. Earlier this year, China extended $10 billion in
                  credits to oil- and gas-rich Kazakhstan and a $3 billion credit to
                  Turkmenistan to help it develop new gas fields, and agreed to make a
                  $1-billion investment in Tajikistan to build electricity generation
                  projects. China has thus overtaken Russia as the biggest donor for and
                  investor in Central Asia.</p>
              <p>Moscow earlier this year promised over $1 billion in economic aid
                  and credits to Kyrgyzstan and set up a $10-billion anti-crisis fund for
                  Central Asia. But it cannot compete with China’s financial might and
                  this is one reason it wants India to become a full SCO member.</p>

              <p>I think the most important factor in peace or war is whether the U.S political elite will accept the coming mutlipolar world or will they resist and insist on maintaining their hegemony.</p>
              <p>If they resist, there will be conflict.</p>
              <p>Right now there is debate in U.S foreign policy circles regarding this issue.</p>
              <p>Those who insist on USA global hegemony like the neocons:</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p class="text1">In fact, strategic overreach is not the problem and
              retrenchment is not the solution. The United States cannot afford to
              turn its back on its international commitments and allies--the allies
              that helped us defeat fascism and communism in the 20th century, and
              the alliances we have forged more recently, including with the newly
              liberated citizens of Iraq and Afghanistan.  <span style="color: #ff0000;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Our economic difficulties
              will not be solved by retreat from the international arena. They will
              be made worse.</strong></span></span></p>
              <p class="text1">In this new era, the consequences of failure and the
              risks of retreat would be even greater than before. The challenges we
              face require 21st century strategies and <span style="color: #ff0000;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>tactics based on a renewed
              commitment to American leadership.</strong></span></span> The United States remains the
              world’s indispensable nation -- indispensable to international peace,
              security, and stability, and indispensable to safe-guarding and
              advancing the ideals and principles we hold dear...</p>

              <p class="text1"> </p>
              <p>Against the backdrop of an ever-bloodier conflict in Iraq, <span style="color: #ff0000;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>American
              foreign policy is moving in a dangerous direction toward empire.</strong></span></span></p>
              <p>Worrisome imperial trends are apparent in the Bush administration's
              National Security Strategy. <span style="color: #ff0000;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>That document pledges to maintain America's
              military dominance in the world, and it does so in a way that
              encourages other nations to form countervailing coalitions and
              alliances. We can expect, and are seeing now, multiple balances of
              power forming against us. People resent and resist domination, no
              matter how benign.</strong></span></span></p>
              <p>We are a diverse group of scholars and analysts from across the
              political spectrum who believe that the move toward empire must be
              halted immediately. We are united by our desire to turn American
              national security policy toward realistic and sustainable measures for
              protecting U.S. vital interests in a manner that is consistent with
              American values.</p>
              <p>The need for a change in direction is particularly urgent because
              imperial policies can quickly gain momentum, with new interventions
              begetting new dangers and, thus, the demand for further actions. If
              current trends are allowed to continue, we may well end up with an
              empire that most Americans-especially those whose sons and daughters
              are, or will be, sent into harm's way-don't really favor. The issue
              must be the subject of a broad public debate. The time for debate is
              now....</p>

              <p>Some other strategies by U.S foreign policy theorists:</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>A new grand strategy for the United States should be compatible with the nation’s fundamental values and capable of achieving American goals in the world order that will emerge in the decades ahead.</p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Neither the strategy of US hegemony nor two proposed alternatives, neoisolationism and offshore balancing, meet these tests. </strong></span></span></p>
              <p>The United States needs to prepare itself for a multipolar world in which it is not a solitary hegemon but rather one of several great powers, even if it is the most powerful for decades to come. And the United States has to prepare itself to cooperate in the interest of security with other major powers either as a member of a great-power concert or as a participant in an alliance against one or more powerful aggressors.</p>
              <p>Because similar military capabilities would be required in either a concert of power or a balance of power strategy, <span style="color: #ff0000;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>this approach can be defined as a concert-balance strategy for a multipolar world...</strong></span></span></p>
              <p><a href="http://www.carlisle.army.mil/usawc/Parameters/08autumn/lind.htm">http://www.carlisle.army.mil/usawc/Parameters/08autumn/lind.htm</a></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Fortunately, one approach has proved effective in the past and could
              serve America again today:<span style="color: #ff0000;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong> "offshore balancing." </strong></span></span></p>
              <p>During the cold war,
              this strategy enabled Washington to contain Iran and Iraq and deter
              direct Soviet intervention in the oil-rich Persian Gulf. As a Middle
              East policy, offshore balancing may be less ambitious than Bush's grand
              design was—no one promises it will lead to an "Arab spring"—but it will
              be much more effective at protecting actual U.S. interests.</p>
              <p>So what would it look like? <span style="color: #ff0000;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>As an offshore balancer, the United States
              would keep its military forces—especially its ground and air
              forces—outside the Middle East, not smack in the center of it. Hence
              the term "offshore."</strong></span></span></p>
              <p>As for "balancing," that would mean <span style="color: #ff0000;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>relying on
              regional powers like Iran, Iraq and Saudi Arabia to check each other. </strong></span></span></p>
              <p>Washington would remain diplomatically engaged, and when necessary
              would assist the weaker side in a conflict. It would also use its air
              and naval power to signal a continued U.S. commitment to the region and
              would retain the capacity to respond quickly to unexpected threats,
              like Iraq's invasion of Kuwait in 1990.</p>
              <p>But—and this is the key
              point—the<span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong> <span style="color: #ff0000;">United States would put boots on the ground in the Middle
              East only if the local balance of power seriously broke down and one
              country threatened to dominate the others.</span> </strong></span>Short of that, America would
              keep its soldiers and pilots "over the horizon"—namely at sea, in bases
              outside the region or back home in the United States....</p>

              <p><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: black;'>Ironically back in the 90s we were concern about trades blocks now we see the desire to decouple from N.A.. </span></p>
              <p><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: black;'>Ultimately the only concern is that since we are dealing by region any conflict arises will see not only realignment of states but a larger scale opponent meet one another which we have not seemed before. </span></p>
              <p><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: black;'>Conventional war would mean a long and costly war, and conventional tools of war alone may not be sustainable to any nation political interest. Eventual use of WMD is the way to go. </span></p>

              <p>Not really.  Within areas of defense, Singapore is always closely aligned with the biggest dog around; the US.  </p>
              <p>However, Singapore is always going around generating goodwill and interests in our region, letting people know that they all have a share and a common economic interest.  They adopt a rather multilateral approach when it comes to handling regional powers.  At the same time, we stay out of their hair over certain sensitive issues. </p>
              <p>The US knows that "baseline" that we have, and if I am not wrong, they do not press us to take their positions over their squabbles in Asia.  In exchange, we provide logistics and maintenance support for their ships.  We make money from that, and they have an assured "friendly" port in neighborhood.  Win - Win.</p>
