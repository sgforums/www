              <p>Hi Guys and girls,</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I'm new to the forum. I just have a few questions that i was hoping that some of you military nuts of Singapore might be able to help me with. Or at least enlighten.</p>
              <p>The question is actually larger than just a sentence and I'll try to be brief a much as I can.</p>
              <p>I am a 27 years old male of a mixed background (asian/euro) and have lived in Singapore during my childhood up to the age of 17. Due to the actions and wishes of my parents I left for Europe and have been here ever since.</p>
              <p>My parents have then decided to stay in Singapore and acquired a PR status for them and my siblings, which they have held for quite a while now. In my heart and soul I feel more Asian and have since been looking for a way to get back to Singapore to be closer with my parents and the rest of my siblings.</p>
              <p>I am University educated, I have roughly 5 years work experience in the private sector and speak more than 4 Asian and European languages and curently hold an EU citizenship.</p>
              <p>Now the questions are, in the case i would apply for a PR:</p>
              <p>1. Could anyone explain to me what the implication the army / national service would have on me should I decide to move back to Singapore? (age impact, etc)</p>
              <p>2. If the army do require me to join, which I dont mind, would there be a career path in there as a professional soldier instead of a conscript? as I do not mind military service - especially i I could make a career out of it.</p>
              <p>3. Would there be any possibilities to actually volunteer in the army in order to get a PR/ citizenship?</p>
              <p>4. Any advises/ websites you could point to and resources to better understand my options and chances? Any personal experience would of couse be welcomed.</p>
              <p>Please do not slag me of as one of those foreigners trying to live off Singapore's success and not wanting to serve (as I see in many forums :)) - I do not mind military service as it is part of being a Singaporean and I do not wish to avoid it.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I know it is a rather large question but I am looking forward to some feedback, thanks in advance.</p>

              <p>well, if you are a 2nd generation PR, which means that your parents were PRs, you would have to do military or other types of national service... could be in the civil defence or the police too..</p>
              <p>as for a career in the military, i think those who want a career in it had a headstart as they would have enlisted before they were 20 so you're at a disadvantage.. practically, it's better not to...</p>
              <p>i've heard of people volunteering to serve national service to "help" in their PR and citizenship application but that's about it.. heard..</p>
              <p>if it's about PR and citizenship, you can go check on your eligibility here =&gt; <a href="https://www.psi.gov.sg/NASApp/tmf/TMFServlet?app=NEAT-PUBLIC&amp;isNew=true&amp;Reload=true">ICA Website</a></p>
              <p>good luck!</p>

              <p>Even after your PR is granted,they might not definitely call you up for NS even though you are liable for it.</p>
              <p>As the Bear pointed out,NS can be done in the SCDF and SPF too instead of the army.Which you go to is up to the govt,you cannot indicate a preference.</p>
              <p>Career in the military?At your current age,you would be better off continuing your current line of work using your prior experience.When they call you up for NS,it is a part of your obligation,they won't set out a career path for you at the start.I believe you have the intention to sign on to the Army only as an officer and not as an NCO right?Even if you get enlisted into the army,they might not shortlist you to go for officer course and you might end up ording as an enlisted rank only(eg.Cpl).Once you do not qualify for OCS after your basic military training,it is unlikely that you will ever get to be a commissioned officer in the SAF.</p>

              <p>For your case, you are not a PR or a citizen though you have lived here for quite some years, and your parents applied for PR only after sending you abroad when you are 17, thus I highly doubt you have any NS liability. </p>
              <p>And I will strongly advise you against signing on at your age, given that you already have private work experience and a degree. Just to let you know, once you are out of SAF at the age of 40/45/50, your time as a soldier does not count as work experience.  </p>

              <p>Hi All,</p>
              <p>Thanks for all your helpful comments, the career in the army question was very hypothetical of me and it seems not to be the way to go.</p>
              <p>@ Forbiddensinner - You got it right, I do not have the PR status like the rest of my family, thus I do not qualify as a 2nd generation PR.</p>
              <p>So are you saying that I do not have any NS liability at all if I get my PR? one last confusion remain from me, as a PR to Singapore is it not COMPULSORY to be called up for some kind of NService? Or is it some kind of a random pick?</p>
              <p>I know you probably won't need to if u are in your late 30s or 40s, which is not in my case. And I wouldn't sign either if it is not a mandatory requirement.</p>
              <p>Also thanks to the Bear and baikachuchu for the links.</p>
              <p>Cheers,</p>

              <p>If you just apply and get a PR (your parents are not PRs), there is no ns liability. We give out free PR-ships with no strings attached for the person in question. But in your case, the best way is for you to send an email or call Mindef/ICA to check. Their information would be more accurate and also official.</p>
