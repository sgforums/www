In this forum and at least during NSF or when the SAF100 applies it matters what kind of funny ideas come across.<br><br>For the record I am an NCO with some experience working under some scholar officers and non-scholar types. Most times no diff between the two (labeled or otherwise) EXCEPT that some who always never fail to astound me are from the both ends of the sepectrum.<br><br>I knew a CPT ("A" levels dropout) who by a miracle of dumb luck was promoted to CPT after 12 years as LTA MTO. Everything because of a lack of ability we suffered under him as OC. Eventually he resigned before he passed his "sell by date" as CPT.<br><br>I trained a scholar batch at BMT, many were destined to be scholar officers. Most were too theory driven, some absolutely inept, but because of their Super WH status was sent up to OCS and later got scholarships. Yes, the best and few are exceptional, but the majority was sadly lacking in command ability.<br><br>Above is only my two cents worth.</div>

I've nothing against scholars flying up the promotion ladder &amp; becoming COA or CDF. But seriously, in times of war, how effective are these ppl?<br><br>The ability to get all As in exams does not equate the ability to make effective decisions in combat. Similarly, one's grades does not reflect on one's soldiering ability. Best e.g. being some A-level students in my coy who were slackers &amp; chao keng all the way, while there were some O-level students who were damn on the ball.<br><br>If I had to choose between experience &amp; education, I'd choose experience. During my active days, our coy had 4 platoons. Our's was the only platoon with a 1WO as a PC. The rest had 2LT or LTA. All the other platoons had tons of trouble ranging from unhappy soldiers to sub standard performance. Our's was the only platoon with minimal trouble.<br><br>Call it coincidence if you like. I, on the other hand, feel its 'cos our 1WO had the experience to keep things under control. He demanded we performed well while looking after our welfare.
