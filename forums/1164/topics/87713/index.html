Why?</div></blockquote>Interesting thread for a show stopper. Unlike most normal people, I eat, shit etc military things (no not signed on). However I for one cannot identify more than one general in Singapore army. Ask me about Napleon's marshals, US or UK generals from the year dot to now I may be able to spout a fact or two.<br><br>Ask me who is the clown in charge of my present brigade, DUH! buay sie.<br><br>Why? Don't care, don't think they will be around to make decisions that will make me a better hokkien peng. Worst still have innate fear that this joker or some other joker will do another Boo boo that will make me cring to talk about being the best, general or otherwise.<br><br>How then do we measure the best? Not without a war is the unfortunate answer. unfortunately my glum view of the SAF is that we can fight the fight when the chips are down, but not before a lot of mistakes are made and a lot more blood is spilled.<br><br>I have seen, taught and trained 'the best of the best' (SAF scholars batch Dec 1986, President Scout winners 2000) and it frightens me to think that among those clowns are potential BG's, Ministers, future leaders etc. They are basically good chaps but tend to walk ten cm above the ground (not connect with Mother earth) most of the time.<br><br>the proof of the pudding is in the eating, and for generals its how many battles they manage not to lose.<br><br>Napleon once asked his aide if a certain Marshal was lucky. His aide was suprized, why lucky. "Brave generals are a dime a dozen", it is the lucky ones that win the wars.<br><br></div>

As long as the govt's policy never change, you can never see a soldier such as COL Loo heading the army. In the past 10 years, all the chief of respective forces are good in academic background. We no longer call ourselves fighting soldiers but thinking or some say citizen army. We no longer sleep on foam bed, but 6" dunlopilo bed with latex pillow. The management of the forces are approaching MNC style.<br><br>Who knows due to the lack of land space for training and male to do NS, our country might outsource the defence to other countries.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>No need to be so cynical.<br><br>While I do think that we might perhaps be too top-heavy with staff officers, it's more of a recognition that the (lower-ranked) combat officers don't get enough publicity from the pro-establishment media.<br><br>It's also fair to say that the SAF hasn't been battle-tested for 2 generations since independence; the pioneering deployments from 1SIR (Borneo) &amp; 2SIR (Johore) occuring before '65 during Konfrantasi. But within those parameters, if we set the standard bar at the maximum-possible level of operational readiness, I'll say our officer corps have historically done an excellent job of troop preparation.<br><br>&amp; the latter achievement cannot be underrated, cuz without it there's no way we could've otherwise mobilized local aid for local emergencies since the British left (memorably the big-time floods the blighted the entire island), right though to the last decade when we started to send overseas detachments as assistance (Cambodia, East Timor, Gulf War I, Philippines, now Iraq).<br><br>Along the way, there's serious peacetime calamities/crises (Syoros disaster, Cable-car tragedy, Hotel New World collapse, SARS) as well as security breaches (Laju incident, SQ117 hijack) that was largely resolved by Singaporeans ourselves - no easy feat given our small resource pool. Sure, it's different from true military warfare but, if you believe in the Total Defence concept, it's a testamount to the leadership &amp; common-man aptitude that the relevant people didn't fail the test when called upon.<br><br>For one, I'm thankful that the SAF doesn't suffer from internal rivalries &amp; warlordism traits that sometimes taints other military forces. Mind you, the respective field commanders of the afore-mentioned deployments also had to do a lot of tri-service coordination between the Army, Navy, RSAF, SCDF, et al. - &amp; this is where I like to think all the staff-officer training stints didn't go to waste.<br><br>For example, Lee Hsien Loong (then a Colonel &amp; just before leaving for politics) directed the multifacted Cable-car rescue mission, just like the current SCDF Commisioner (forgot his name) did the same for Hotel New World. It's now largely forgotten, but President S.R. Nathan (then with ISD) also led the Laju negotiation team &amp; offered himself as hostage to the Jap Red Army kidnappers.<br><br>That said, I'll vote for Goh Keng Swee as Singapore's greatest General - well, he was an "Honorary Colonel" with the Singapore Arty. Our own version of US Union General George McCllelan, to draw a comparison. GKS was the de-facto CIC that rebuilt a conscript army for the new republic &amp; then galvanized its evolution in to a more-professional outfit; Winston Choo, LHL, et al. blossomed under his watch. To quote from today's, 31/7/04 Straits Times article by KC Vijayan, "A review in the 1980s of a collection of [GKS's] essays on economics paid tribute by saying defence ministers elsewhere would egarly await his essays on how to start a defence force from scratch."<br><br>NB. I'll also say that multi-country training exercises like the FPDA arrangement or equivalent keep a fair number of SAF scholar-officers on their toes, when it comes to executing the classroom &amp; Wargame-Center stuff. It's a real opportunity &amp; the next-best thing to actual conflict.</div>

He is a commando turned Armour officer, currently a colonel. A NUS grad, he was also a former national water polo player.
