Actually instead of buying F15 from US, singapore should have bought SU30 from russia.

Currently, we can share common spares and repair tooling.<br><br>The SU30 would probably require Israeli modification to suit our needs.</div>

Don't forget that we may still have yet to enhance it with Israeli modifications like our current F-16C/D Blk52+. The SG is also a twin-pilot plane.</div>
