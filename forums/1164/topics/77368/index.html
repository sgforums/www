Would the application be even considered?<br><br>I am Currently Serving NS in a combat engineer unit.

            <div class='col-md body'>ok, if u sign on right after u POP/POC from tracom during your police NS time, u sign on 5 yrs which includes ur 2.5 yrs NS. during the 1st 2.5 yrs, u will receive regular pay (without NS bonus) after 2.5 yrs u receive the NS bonus included in ur pay.<br><br>Typically, u will normally be posted to land divisions as NPCO for a year or so. posting varies, if u would like to be posted to a certain branch, pls let your NPC's CO/OO know so he can recommend u if that certain branch needs people.<br><br>For STAR, u just go for the 1 day 'screening', if u clear it, you go for a 12 day in-camp selection, if u clear it again u go for 4 mths of basic training and viola, u are a STAR officer. then u will go for other more specialised courses.<br><br>For PCG, obviously u need to go for a course to learn how to drive the boats etc...<br><br>If u sign on after your army NS, its 5 yrs with the NS bonus included in all your pay packets.<br><br>As an NPCO, u will need to patrol, attend to cases and lodge report for complainants, there is also CSSP activities and etc....its running a 12 hr shift system....after a few weeks u will get the hang of it.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>typically 3 yrs promote once if u never get 'demerit' point...of cos can get promoted earlier or later, all depends on ur performance. but 1 thing is sure, u surely get promoted at least once in the 5 yrs...<br><br>CNB i not so sure but i think their vocational allowance is higher so maybe u can take home 100+ more every month ? not so sure...but STAR is 650...provided u pass the shooting and physical test conducted every 2-3 mths.<br><br>ask ur police friends, they will tell u more, here cannot say too much lah....after listening then u consider loh..</div>
