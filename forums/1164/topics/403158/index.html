              One certainly can have both gl and rifle ie CIS GL on a SAR-21. Every infantry squads has this. Its also a lot lighter than a light AGL (which is 19kg btw).
              
              The 40mm LVER round is useful cos it extends the reach of the GL (not AGL) from the traditional 400m to beyond that.
              
              The further one can engage the enemy, the less casualties.

              <p>For  extended ranges you will also need a much better sighting /  fire control system otherwise it makes no sense if you miss the target - just wasting ammo.</p>
              <p>With the existing sights, getting a hit at 300 m is already a big challenge in a peacetime range.</p>

              Agreed. However not cost-effective to have special sight just for 1 round GL. 
              
              CIS AGL does have fire optic sight (and that's why it has high velocity rounds at 2.2km range).

              <p>I think the British Army uses H&amp;K UGLs with a new FC system which significantly improves first round hits. I believe it is uses a basic laser rangefinder / ballistic computer system.</p>

              You're talking about the 25mm grenade rounds eg OICW which has the flatter trajectory. The 40mm GL has an arc trajectory which makes laser guidance (ie straight line) less effective. Probably for range-finding.
                      
              As to ballistic computer (actually its a processor), that's again added cost. That's why fire optics are used for AGL rather than rifle one-shot GLs. Its also the reason why OICW hasn't entered full scale production. It couldn't meet weight and cost targets.
                      
              There are always trade-offs. Cost, weight, size, effectiveness, accuracy.
                  
              Having said that, there are specific sights for the standalone single shots e.g. M320.

              <p>No mistake.</p>
              <p>I am referring to the British Army's SA80 Underslung Grenade Launcher (UGL) system comprising the Heckler &amp; Koch AG-36 40 mm system.</p>
              <p>This is now equipped with a Holographic Sight / Laser Rangefinder as part of the British Army's    Future Infantry Soldier Technology  ( FIST )   program. These have already seen operational service since 2008 in operations in Afghanistan. First round hits are easily achieved with the new sights.  </p>
              <p>Well,  better to carry some additional  weight &amp;  kill  the target with the first shot  rather than with a few rounds while the enemy is sending bullets back to you.</p>

              Can't be. The fist sights are meant for the rifle not GL. It still uses the nice little ladder (see below).

              <p>You are grossly mistaken. Nice little ladder sights cannot be used in 40 mm UGL systems to take out targets at 400 m or more. They are at best used for up to 200 m max.</p>

              <p>That's where you don't understand how GL aiming works. Basically for every range and velocity, you need an angle cos that's where the round will go.</p>
              <p>The problem with older GLs is that the range of the grenade is limited by its velocity ie 400m. Even if one has a RAAM, its not going to help extending the range to 600m.</p>
              <p>If one has a different velocity, firing at the same angle = different landing point.</p>
              <p>What the RAAM does is to calculate the range using a laser rangefinder (as I have stated before) and allocating the appropriate angle so that the range and shell lands where you want it to. Sounds fantastic but that's all it does. And if one introduces a higher velocity round like the STK LVER, its basically back to the manufacturer for recalibration. And if one thinks its going to be pin-point accurate... lol. Still too many factors to take into account.</p>
              <p>You can do that with a ladder sight so long as one knows the angle and range. The M-16 has the quadrant sight for the M203 that does pretty much the same thing. There are already so many laser rangefinders incl those for the SAR-21.</p>
              <p>Its 92mil swiss francs for 2700 moskitos and 2300 raams. That translates into 18,400 sfr or $20+k per sight. Thank you very much.</p>

              <p>For that money, I can get an LGB for every sight instead. More bang for the buck.</p>

              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt 1in;"><strong><em><span style="font-family: Arial;">Clearly most 40 mm systems today were designed for max <span style="text-decoration: underline;">effective</span> range of 350 to<span>  </span>400 m. <span> </span>Ballistically, <span> </span>they can go much further. </span></em></strong><strong><em><span style="font-family: Arial;">The issue is accuracy. <span> </span>With iron sights and the soldier’s range estimate ,<span>  </span>accuracy will be poor. <span> </span></span></em></strong></p>
              <p style="margin-left: 1in;"> </p>
              <p style="margin-left: 1in;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">If one has a different velocity, firing at the same angle = different landing point.</span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt 1in;"><strong><em><span style="font-family: Arial;">You really need some tutoring. Its not only velocity and elevation that determine where the round lands. There are other factors involved. I will be happy to give you a lesson. </span></em></strong></p>
              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt 1in;"><strong><em><span style="font-family: Arial;"></span></em></strong></p>
              <p style="margin-left: 1in;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">What the RAAM does is to calculate the range using a laser rangefinder (as I have stated before) and allocating the appropriate angle so that the range and shell lands where you want it to. Sounds fantastic but that's all it does. </span></p>
              <p style="margin-left: 1in;"><strong><em><span style="font-family: Arial;">It does not sound fantastic at all to me. <span> </span>It is just simple physics. </span></em></strong></p>
              <p style="margin-left: 1in;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">And if one introduces a higher velocity round like the STK LVER, its basically back to the manufacturer for recalibration. <span> </span></span><strong><em><span style="font-family: Arial;">Recalibration of what ?</span></em></strong><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;"> </span></p>
              <p style="margin-left: 1in;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">And if one thinks its going to be pin-point accurate... lol. Still too many factors to take into account.<span>  </span></span></p>
              <p style="margin-left: 1in;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">You can do that with a ladder sight so long as one knows the angle and range. </span></p>
              <p style="margin-left: 1in;"><strong><em><span style="font-family: Arial;">You can  ?!   I guess  you have a built in biological protractor and <span> </span>rangefinder. Are you bionic ? <span> </span>I am sure that the SAF will be interested<span>  </span>in<span>  </span>your abilities. The SAF then<span>  </span><span> </span>really will not need to purchase a RAAM for you.<span>  </span>Personally , I will gladly have a RAAM on my weapon. </span></em></strong></p>
              <p style="margin-left: 1in;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">The M-16 has the quadrant sight for the M203 that does pretty much the same thing. There are already so many laser rangefinders incl those for the SAR-21.</span></p>
              <p style="margin-left: 1in;"><strong><em><span style="font-family: Arial;">So we already have laser range finders in our SAR21s<span>  </span>? </span></em></strong></p>
              <p style="margin-left: 1in;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">Its 92mil swiss francs for 2700 moskitos and 2300 raams. That translates into 18,400 sfr or $20+k per sight. Thank you very much.</span></p>

              <p>Clearly, still no idea on how GL is used. If a person is mobile ie charging at you, the chances of hitting a target with a GL round is very small, raam or no raam. Funny since one would expect to know the flight time of a GL arguing saying that its simple physics.</p>

              <p>lol. I see we're resorting to personal attacks again once facts run out.</p>
              <p>An M203 grenade travels at 79 metres per second. An average person runs at 5-8 metres per second (unless you happen to be usain bolt in which case, it would be 10+ or if you're 200 kg, then it would be 0). A grenade kill radius is 5m. Its not as accurate as you think.</p>
              <p>As to the definition of bionic, bionic is defined as a biological process ie living process. We refer to bionics because that's used as an enhancement eg a bionic arm is an artificial arm to assist in arm movements. How different is that from a mechanical sight? Your english needs improving.</p>
              <p><a href="http://www.yourdictionary.com/medical/bionic">http://www.yourdictionary.com/medical/bionic</a></p>
              <p>As to the price, there is the press release (8.9.2009) which you can access in the link provided which states the contract value.</p>
              <p>As to why the UK acquired it... They have acquired aircraft carriers, nuclear missiles and nuke subs, should we do so just because they have? The UK has no army conscription, should we follow? The saf decides on its own merits. </p>

              <p>Sorry if you think I am making personal attacks on you. I am not . I just expanded on what you have used to describe yourself.</p>
              <p>Hitting a long range stationary target at 350 to 400 m with iron sights is already difficult , what more a moving one.   Worse if you are using a low  velcocity 40 mm grenade which has a high trajectory profile.  </p>
              <p>My point is that the ordinary infantryman cannot accurately estimate range.Neither can he accurately elevate the UGL to the angle required to achieve the estimated range. When  these two critical inputs are incorrect he will surely miss the target. A FC system such as the RAAM will eliminate these errors and ensure a high probability of hitting the target on the first round at long range. This has been proven by the British Army when using the H&amp;K UGL  RAAM combination in Afghanistan. They feel that the effectiveness of this system justifies the cost of these weapons &amp; that why they have purchased a substantial amount of these systems.   </p>
              <p>I will not argue with you if want to  describe a weapons sight as bionic. If you read the definition clearly, it must be an extension or enhancement of an anatomical feature. Clearly a rifle is not anatomical. A weapons sight is attached to  aweapon, a rifle in this case.</p>
              <p>If a weapons system is proven to be highly effective in a real war, the SAF shud also adopt it . The SAF  does not merely  " follow  " others.   I am an advocate  for  better optical sights for all SAF weapons. Iron sights are ok, but the new generation of weapons sights are highly effective &amp; increases dramatically the hit ratio.  Dont you forget that  you as a NSF or NSman are the front line SAF infantry.</p>
              <p>The STK weapon in your link has been in development for a long time.  As you can see, it also has a FC system.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>By the way, you have not answered my question about your M203 experience. You missed right ?</p>

              <p>UGLs use LV rounds for obvious reasons. HV rounds are for AGLs (and the difference in speed isn't that much either. Its still 20+ sec at max range). Its only recently that the trend went to slightly higher velocity for UGLs to extend range eg LVER.</p>
              <p>There's a lot of other factors that influence accuracy beyond range, angle and even munitions, even with RAAM.</p>
              <p>Bionic is bionic. If you don't know the meaning, don't claim to know and worse argue about it and contradict yourself.</p>
              <p>As to my M203 experience. What I have experienced is that its easier and faster to hit a man with a rifle bullet than an M203 at 200m or 300m than with a GL. 6 out of 6 for an M-16 much less a SAR-21 with a laser. I don't need to waste time on a rangefinder. That's not what a GL is used for. Its an ignorant question and its really a waste of time to tackle it.</p>
              <p>You can't hit a person in defilade with a bullet, that's why you use a weapon that fires in an arc. You can do that with an airburst munition, call in arty or better yet, an LGB subject to conditions.</p>
              <p>Of course if a weapon is effective, one should consider it. Nukes are highly effective but one doesn't need to procure it. Without regard to cost, necessity and usefulness, any procurement is blind folly.</p>

              <p>FC for GLs are nice... but it doesn't solve the problem of accuracy if the round travels a steep ballistics trajectory.  That is because the firing solution will require you to raise the weapon to an angle that will hit the target.  If the FC sight is fixed mounted on the weapon, the higher u raise, the further away from the center the target gets.  And if it gets to a point that the target is totally out of the sight, then it will not be accurate.</p>
              <p>For an FC to provide rapid and accurate firing solution, it has to be somehow mounted independent of the weapon's raise angle.  Which means the sight remains stabilized and fixed on the intended target, while some kind of symbology tells the shooter if he is at an acceptable angle for a solution.</p>
              <p>It is likely with the next generation of advanced combat systems, where soldiers wear heads up displays of sorts, that such an FC may be able to accurately target without the soldier taking his eyes off the target. </p>

              <p>Oh, I am absolutely clear what is the meaning of bionic &amp; so do a vast majority of others. But  when you persist &amp; insist that a weapons sight is bionic even after it has been explained to you in the simplest possible terms in a dictionary, I will have to rest my case about your vocabulary level.  </p>
              <p>OK, OK................you missed.  Told you so. Just only if the SAF had equipped you with a  RAAM type FCS.........it cud have turned out differently.</p>

              <p>Dear Shogun,</p>
              <p>I believe that the RAAM FCS  and other similar systems already address this issue of  weapons elevation.</p>
              <p>There is never a silver bullet solution, but FCS for UGLs have made it possible to achieve a high degree of first round hits on targets as experienced by the British Army in combat situations when using RAAM type systems. They must be sufficiently convinced of its effectiveness to purchase so many  of these systems.</p>
              <p>As you can see , the US and now the BA &amp; many other armies are increasingly attaching optics on small arms. Almost all front line US troops are now equipped with optical sights on their M4s and M16s. The same trend will probably carry on to UGLs, hand held AT weapons, MGs etc etc  as costs come down &amp; as more computing power is packed into  smaller, highly rugged systems.  </p>

              <p>lol. Like I said, when facts fail, turn to personal insults esp self-deluded insults.</p>
              <p>Too bad. Since this has been a wishing thread, I think most people, myself included, would prefer good looking women companions in NS instead of a raam.</p>

              <p>Dear Weasel,</p>
              <p>A fact is a fact. You confused it is as an  insult.  You will just have to accept that you missed the target when you fired your M203 a long long time ago  &amp; now wish that you had a RAAM that day. It is you who is in fact delusionary when you fail to see the plain truth.</p>
              <p>When facing the enemy  coming at you  from 400 m away,  I rather have the RAAM &amp; ULG. Funny  I never met any good looking women during NS in my SIR unit. That explains  it.............in NS were you  in the SAF Music and Dance Troupe ?  </p>

              <p>I think the British Army uses H&amp;K UGLs with a new FC system
              which significantly improves first round hits. I believe it is uses
              a basic laser rangefinder / ballistic
              computer system.</p>
              <p>SAF shud adopt such as system especially with extended range
              rounds. Worth the expense when you hit a target.  Missing your
              target only attracts incoming rounds to the firer.</p>
