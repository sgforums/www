Don't think that there's any other rifle that allows a quicker magazine change.<br><br>My fantasy is the SAR-21 (keep the piston and bolt) in a conventional configuration with those plastic magazines that the Canadians use, an M-16 type lower receiver made of plastic, ambidextrous magazine release, ambidextrous fire selector and an ambidextrous SAR21-like cocking handle above the bolt in the upper receiver so that i can keep my hand on the trigger and the weapon pointed in the right direction at all times.<br><br>Anyone tried cocking an M-16 with the left hand while holding it to your shoulder with the right hand on the piston grip??<br><br>And a bayonet lug.<br><br>Errrm....does that sound like the M8??</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>No, it is not a copy of the HK M416.  this one uses a FAL type gas piston, it is chrome plated on the BOlt carrier and that woulkd prolong the life of the internals.<br><br>Yes, I have shot all the piston base rifle like the AUG, SIG550, L1A1, FAL, and all of them are very easy to maintain after prolong firing.. not like the M16 which have high pressure crystalized carbon in the bolt.

            <div class='col-md body'>Pardon my lack of rifle experience, but my experience in NS and reservist, firing the M 16, CAR 15 and even the old AR 15, were pretty good. Jams happened due to 2 main things... the firing of blanks and poor condition magazines. The gas blow back mechanism to chamber the next round is one of the soundest in the world.<br><br>The main thing good about the M16 is its closed bolt concept.... which helps block out stuff from the chamber. It is also the easiest to field strip and clean.  A bit long and not so good for FIBUA fighting , or in tight spaces (e.g. helicopters and AFVs).<br><br>Tell me more about this new piston thingy...</div>

Any weapon that can hit something out to 400m is ACCURATE as far as I'm concerned. I doubt I'd be able to see the gong very clearly much less shoot at it.<br><br>I heard said that the AK accuracy is rubbish beyond 200m.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>there are vasious make of AK , some are better than the other, the best AK I have own are Bulgarian , POlish, CHinese and Yugo made!  they are very accurate and well made ! I have some bad luck on a ROmmaniun AK74 which would shoot 5 MOA at 100 meter. So, the rubbish about not able to hit things with AK all depends on the rifle and also the ammunition they use.  on one particular AK74, shooting Banual 59 grain FMJ would achive 1.5 to 2" group at 100 meter, but switching to Tula 60 grain FMJ the group open out to 4 ".<br><br>I shoot both IDPA and IPSC, I find the IPSC a little unrealistic since the gears and all that is a little not in the real world ! But it is a lot of fun especially with the 3 gun matches. IDPA is more real life using non "star war" type weapons and have to shoot on concealment and proper reloading drills.  Howwver recently, IDPA have come out with too much rules that makes the game ridiculous! MOst of the freinds switch to IPSC!<br><br>I beleif SIngapore also have a IPSC club !but wonder ifthey have 3 gun matches and all that!   Looks like 3 gun is gettting so popular and with all these nice M16 Carbines with all those upgrades!<br><br>DaveC!</div>
