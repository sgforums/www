            <div class='col-md body'>Dun think so, unless Hollywood physics works. Becos if you watch enuff CSI and study physics, you will realize that a bullet contains about as much energy then a softball thrown by a pro-league pitcher, quite a bit of energy, but not quite enuff to break a neck with the sheer impact. The energy you get when whapped with a bullet is as much as the energy of the recoil experienced in the gun when the bullet was fired (newtons laws of motion).<br><br>Therefore, people will not "fly" (usually into some large glass object) when shot by shotgun rounds like when we see in the movies, becos to impart enuff force in the buckshot to launch a person backwards will mean that the person firing the shotgun will also experience the same recoil force in the opposite direction when he pulls the trigger, newton's law in action again.<br><br>However, if the helmet strap is not on correctly or secured well, the bullet can knock your helmet back with enuff force to strangle you or give you a sore throat.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>If kevlar cannot stop a bullet, then all the body armor worn by Special Forces will be quite useless.<br><br>Some bullets can knock out a person wearing body armor, and leave him with a severe bruise. A shot onto a kevlar helmet, will probably leave a heavy headache to the wearer, with much being dependent on the angle of impact of the bullet against the kevlar helmet - that is if it is a glancing shot hitting the helmet at a tangent, or a 90 degree perpendicular impact against the helmet.<br><br>High velocity bullets can still penetrate steel helmets, and those 1969 steel helmets worn by the early NSF in Singapore were WW-2 types, and used largely by the US Armed Forces during the Vietnam War. There were some reported puncture of those steel helmets during both the Wars - dependent on the angle of impact.<br><br></div>

A shot onto a kevlar helmet, will probably leave a heavy headache to the wearer, with much being dependent on the angle of impact of the bullet against the kevlar helmet - that is if it is a glancing shot hitting the helmet at a tangent, or a 90 degree perpendicular impact against the helmet.<br><br>High velocity bullets can still penetrate steel helmets, and those 1969 steel helmets worn by the early NSF in Singapore were WW-2 types, and used largely by the US Armed Forces during the Vietnam War.

            <div class='col-md body'>Make no mistake, your Kevlar helmet will stop bullets ONLY UNDER CERTAIN CONDITIONS!!!<br><br>If you're struck by a 5.56, 7.62 or 12.7mm round fired at close range and strikes your at anywhere near 90 degrees, it'll go right through your brain, kevlar helmet or not! What the kevlar does is to offer better protection(can stop rounds flying at higher velocity and at steeper angles) and lighter weight than the steel pot. The Brit squaddie was probably hit by rounds fired from a distance at low angle of penetration. That and the helmet saved his noggin (to use a British term)<br><br>We ran the old steel pot through 5.56 mm rounds at 100m, the rounds went through the front and back the outer shell and inner lining(both steel) EVERYTIME. Thats penetrating 4 layers of steel. That thing'll keep out no more than fragments and the falling rain.<br><br>Will like to run the test through the kevlar helmet sometime   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>If I'm not wrong, the kevlar helmet was supposed to be able to provide protection against 7.62mm threats at moderate to long range 150-300 meters. Fire at close range confirm penetrate one, no doubt about it.<br><br>I think they got make K-pots which can stop rifle fire point blank, for the SWAT guys who use a level <span style="font-style: italic;">nine</span> BA suite. Plus a Lexor visor.</div>
