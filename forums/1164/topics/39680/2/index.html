What the kevlar does is to offer better protection(can stop rounds flying at higher velocity and at steeper angles) and lighter weight than the steel pot. The Brit squaddie was probably hit by rounds fired from a distance at low angle of penetration. That and the helmet saved his noggin (to use a British term)<br><br>We ran the old steel pot through 5.56 mm rounds at 100m, the rounds went through the front and back the outer shell and inner lining(both steel) EVERYTIME. Thats penetrating 4 layers of steel. That thing'll keep out no more than fragments and the falling rain.<br><br>Will like to run the test through the kevlar helmet sometime   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"></div></blockquote>haha go find 1 1st hehe best is still a concrete helm!</div>

Firstly, the energy imparted to the bullet will includes all the propulsive kenitic energy afforded to it by the expanding gases, and that sum total of KE is obtained after subtracting all the other energy conversions (light, sound, heat).

They will blast through the steel helmet will no problem and it will be nothing more then a pot for spilled brains.<br><br>As a matter of fact, I suspect even hollowpoints can penetrate a steel helmet, the steel is thin enuff to allow that. That's becos a typical rifle bullet contains about 1,500-3,000 joules of energy, concentrated on a spot, more then enuff to exceed the mechnical strength and thickness of the steel helmet. The inner lining is no problem.<br></div>

When the bullet is fired, the gases expand to propel the bullet down the barrel, but as the gases expand throughout the barrel, the pressure drops after building up a peak. The bullet can only move as fast as the lowest gas velocity.<br><br>This however, has little bearing on the recoil force generated. What our preception of recoil is however, affected by gun mass and other factors. Whatever it may be, recoil (as in the actual force generated) remains the same as the force of the bullet when it strikes (disregarding other factors)</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Depends on how many layers of Kevlar... level 2 armor usually contains only 12 layers, can stop most handgun rounds.<br><br>I think for heavier threats, levels 5 can stop most rifle rounds.<br><br>The crazy swat armor which is level 9 provides protection equal to <span style="font-style: italic;">56 layers</span> of kevlar, and even more when they put in those composite plates on the front, that one can probably stop shotgun copper slugs, though not without trauma to the body below the impact point.</div>
