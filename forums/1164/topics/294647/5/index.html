            <div class='col-md body'>I hope the brain picking excerise is helpful for your survey or some work.  Anyway here are some general thoughts.<br><br>[quote]Originally posted by damienthedevil:<br><strong>I think this has been done before in this forum but can we think of all the possible War scenarios Singapore will probably be Involve in -<br><br>Lets start with Malaysia and Indonesia -<br><br>[b]If It is only with Malaysia -</strong><br><br><strong>If It is only with Indonesia -</strong><br><br>Unless there are dramatics shift in Geopolitics or a extreme regime changed in the fundamental of Indo or my regime.  i don't see why SG, MY or Indo would take up arms on each other. I am also sure all the regional military analyst would have done enough study to conclude that there are much to loose politically. So at the end of the day so long as the neighbour maintain balance of power, nobody will move their butt.<br><br>that is also to say that Indo or My would not allow SG to expand its territorial claim as it is. As that would tilt the balance of power so it would never be a one sided war.  if a one sided war ever happen SG would have to gave up something really huge maybe merge with MY.<br><br>in military terms SAF can win battles but War can be a different outcome. There are many old topics i am sure there are senior in this forum can direct.<br><br><strong>If It is in support of FPDA - Spratleys Island</strong><br><br><strong>If It is in support of UN  -</strong><br><br><strong>IF it is a world wide war say against Iran or North Korea </strong><br><br><strong>IF it is a world wide war say against China</strong><br><br>At the current political level, I'll Â“BETÂ” that SG leader will not send military on Spratleys under FPDA. Infact anything to do with China.  sg will not send military SG interest is only trade lane. We could negociate our way out with China Directly if ever a naval conflict occurred.<br><br>.<br><br>If a UN mission is to be in Asean countries and China is not in the background  than yes sg might send troop into a combat zone. But countries such as myanmar is beyond SG political will.<br><br>I would assume that both China, North Korea, Russia combined and decimated the US (exaggerate) in order to classify as a World at War. What is left is EU and Asia.<br><br>Do u think LHL would fight against world domination or actuallyI am not sure which side is SG going to Stand on at this moment in our leadership? LHL has mention he doesn't want to be in a position to have to choose side between US and China.  We also saw what china can do to SG direction.  In fact i think it is time to review some of the old agreements. The equation of china will change everything by looking at Myanmar it may already have.<br><br>Does sg look at cheque book, and geographical place and said she belong to Asia and follow China next super power ..bla bla bla or does sg stand against Hegemony?<br><br>Until we are clear what is our position, than can we be sure where we train our forces and prepare for SAF to engage. Civilian army cannot be prepared to fight every possible conflict nor can it goes to different continent and wa yan. In the 80Â’s we know Thailand Cambodia border was a possible front. Do u know where is the next possible threat?<br></div>

ThatÂ’s what a political science stream undergraduate can tell apart the EEZ, territorial waters &amp; their relation to international law governing SLOC &amp; EEZ? As I said, the significance of Spratly is its ability to generate a Vast EEZ with abundant oil &amp; gas beneath its seabed. International law of sea entitles the country owns such EEZ to claim such precarious resources but has no right to claim whatever SLOC that crosses the EEZ. So what he claimed Spratly for SLOC securing is legally groundless. For the rest, using Spratly as a logistic midpoint &amp; base for any naval blockage is also meaningless as the Spratly is a series low tide elevations/obstacles providing no vessel replenishing &amp; theater air defense function for naval fleet.<br><br>Pedra Branca case is different, It lies in the narrow and only waterway that links Malacca strait to South China Sea, while Spratly lies in the open sea. By securing Pedra Branca, u have secured the total 24 NMs territorial waters which overlay the SLOC. Territorial water of course is different from EEZ, which is only governed by national law instead of international law, am I right or the Political science student is right?<br><br><blockquote>Its definitely hard to imagine that we would immediately opt for a military confrontation with the Chinese.

I would ask again what the primary precondition is for a city to become the financial/trade/communication center? STABILITY. For superpowers, itÂ’s easy, their superior fire power can ensure no other military force can touch their financial centers like New York &amp; London. Not every country has that super muscle, then how to do, look at Switzerland, by declaring forever neutral standing for whatever matter that is irrelevant to its internal affair, Switzerland also achieves reputed financial capital status. Then see what our political educated tenant will do, thinking a dozens of long haul fighter strikes can score some hits on PLAN and think only trade will be affect. I would say, sorry, such hits towards a giant will only have the itch scrap effect. But  the returned fire by their much superior projection firepower will easily cause your life.<br><br></div>
