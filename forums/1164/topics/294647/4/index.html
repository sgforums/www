            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote>Originally posted by damienthedevil:<br><strong>I think this has been done before in this forum but can we think of all the possible War scenarios Singapore will probably be Involve in -<br><br>Lets start with Malaysia and Indonesia -<br><br>We are geared to fight at two war front simultaneously.<br><br>One a forward movement up north ( the so called mersing line ) and a holding position down south ( The whole of Riau ).  It will be a short and fast campaign, basically to get our neighbours into a negotiation table to agreed to our terms. If it fails, we will be having coffee with the Thais at Hatyai while holding the Indons at bay in a stalemate.<br><br>Whatever the outcome will be, once we start the military action, both south part of W. Malaysia and the Riau Island group will become Singapura land. The negative factor are due to constraints we are not able to engage in a protracted war If it really happens. We are talking about at least 350,000 men in arms.<br><br>[b]If It is only with Malaysia -</strong><br><br>There is no way Malaysia can stop a Singapore onslaught based on current MAF capabilities. The Military campaign in W. Malaysia will be swift and fast. Only problem, are the aftermath of war and the prolong guerilla warfare by the remnants of MAF who will have the Malaysian population support behind them. BTW We will allow the outflux of Malaysian Malay refugees to go to East Malaysia.<br><br>and to have a win win situation -<br><br>We will strike a deal with the Indons and Brunei  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"> , Sarawak goes to Indons, Sabah goes to Brunei and we will take the whole of West Malaysia. Maybe to placade the Thais we will give them Kedah and Langkawi.<br><br><strong>If It is only with Indonesia -</strong><br><br>Indonesia will be tough, We will take control of the Riau Archipelago and It have to be a short and fast military campaign, but holding the Indons at bay in a stalemate will be for a long time. The Riau Island group will become Singapura Protected land. The negative factor are, It will be a protracted campaign and we will always have to be wary of Indonesian intent once we occupy their land for whatever the reason. For long term purpose, We also need to work out a plan to install an independent government for an autonomy independent Riau Archipelogo with strong economic and a military (trained by Singapore of cource ) to hold the Indons at bay.<br><br>.<br><strong>If It is in support of FPDA - Spratleys Island</strong><br><br>Our Airforce, Navy, commandos and guards brigade will be mobilise to engage the enemy of FPDA. Possible sceanario, The Spratleys Island in support of Malaysia. We are the only S. E. Asian country currently with the logistic capabilites to land troops, armor and assist the Malaysians in engaging the PLA in a very short time.<br><br>Our AirForce with the KC-135, conformal and external fuel tanks are able to fly sorties over the spratleys immediately on commencement of hostility together with the RMAF from Labuan. FPDA will have Air Superiority in a very short time. I am not underestimating the PLAAF but they are too faraway to engage in effective aerial warfare. The only way to block the Chinese aggression is to react fast before Spratleys are full of PLN Ships and PLA troops while waiting for International intervention.<br><br><strong>If It is in support of UN  -</strong><br><br>Similarly to what's been happening all this while as in Iraq, Afganistan and East Timor, I presume SG has raise a volunteer battalion made up of mostly regulars and the SF with Airforce and Navy support for UN missions.<br><br><strong>IF it is a world wide war say against Iran or North Korea </strong><br><br>We will mainly utilise our Airforce and Navy for Naval blockage and Air Warfare. Maybe contribute a brigade  ( Guards, commandoes and volunteers  probably ).<br><br><strong>IF it is a world wide war say against China</strong><br><br>I suggest we stay out of It, as the Chinese will definitely will nuke us If we are involved. the PLA will take out all possible adversaries ( Japan, Korea,  Vietnam etc..etc.. ) out of the equation to concentrate on the Amercians.<br><br>Comments - Any other possible scenarios and no kiddy stuff please.<br>[/b]</blockquote>This kinda thing, you can guess and speculate all you want and have all the argument and counter-arguments you can think of.  At the end of the day you will only truly know when the sh!t really hits the fan.<br><br>Wars aren't healthy for Singapore's economy and infrastructure.  We will only fight to defend ourselves and not to poke into other people's business.</div>
