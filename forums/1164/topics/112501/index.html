O. Kinnard, began to fashion an operational reality from a vision Â– what later came to be called Â“airmobilityÂ”.<br><br>Part of this mission was to create a Â‘state of mindÂ’ among the members of the division Â– Â“sky soldiersÂ” as they were called Â– to instill in them belief in the new airmobile concept.  Airmobility had to do more than merely provide Infantry troops with helicopters for rides Â– it needed to train all ground elements in conjunction with all air elements to create a well-honed combat fighting team.<br><br>To differentiate 11th Air Assault Division Â“sky soldiersÂ” from other Army units, General Kinnard had designed and established a Â‘specialÂ’ badgeÂ’ that his Â“sky soldiersÂ” could wear as a mark of their airmobility expertise.  This became the 11th Air Assault Division (Test) Â“Air Assault BadgeÂ”, first issued in the spring of 1964.<br><br>In order to qualify for this badge, each soldier had to successfully rappel from a helicopter, thrice from 60 feet and twice from 120 feet.  Each soldier had to pass aircraft safety procedures, an aircraft orientation, arm and hand signals, combat assault operations, prepare, inspect and rig equipment for a sling load, and be able to lash down equipment carried in cargo helicopters.<br><br>The original Â“Air Assault BadgeÂ” was awarded only to membersÂ’ assigned to the 11th Air Assault Division (Test) and then only for a short time.  In Vietnam, airmobility operations and proficiency became an accepted U S Army tactic, still taught today.<br><br>The original Â“Air Assault BadgeÂ” training criteria lead to the development of the present Sabalauski Air Assault School located at Fort Campbell, KY, which awards the current Air Assault Badge although todayÂ’s badge is substantially different in design and shape.<br><br>The 11th Air Assault Division Â“Air Assault BadgeÂ” was, and still is, an unauthorized badge.  Regardless, many of those awarded the original Â“Air Assault BadgeÂ” still wear it today Â– knowing they were first to do so Â– and to most Â“original sky soldiersÂ” this emblem remains a coveted badge worn with PRIDE![/url]</div>
