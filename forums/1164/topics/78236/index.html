            <div class='col-md body'>Wonder if Malaysia/Indonesia can pull the same stunt on us. If I'm not wrong, they have entire airborne divisions, all RDF within a few hours max. If I were them, I would do a 'shock and awe' on Singapore. ASTROS and arty barrage cum air strikes on armour camps, airbases etc. plus large-scale airborne inflitration. Singapore would not be able to respond for several key reasons. One, our air defence artillery is not up to par compared to our air force. Our Rapiers, Iglas and Mistrals are only short-range, low-level weapons and only I-Hawk capable of hitting long-range high-level. Once our airfields kena hit by Malaysian arty or special forces, our skies are wide open. Malaysian/Indonesian troop transports can choose to fly above range of our SAMS. Second, SAF is very formidable no doubt. But it takes time to first mobilize then deploy. Although we claim this can be done within hours but more realistically, I feel this can take days. This creates a 'window of opportunity' where the SAF would be at its weakest. Any comments?</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>well, it depends on how good your intelligence is. Somebody once mentioned that it is difficult to launch a full scale attack without warning at all, since they have to prep themselves for attack in the first place. Besides, u will have warning as well once diplomatic ties go bad. Moral of the story is to stay on your toes, and how much lead time u have will depend on how good your intel is.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Interesting article, but some other points to consider:<br><br>- Taiwan's military brass might be pro-unification, however, not necessarily on the PRCs terms<br><br>- On the other hand, the RoC's young conscripts are not interested in unification. Full stop<br><br>- Given the state of the US military and its present commitments, plus their companies' economic involvement in China, it is highly unlikely they will intervene.<br><br>- That effectively rules out Japan and South Korea interceding. RoK will also not be interested in sending forces south when the DPRK is still around.<br><br>- Still, an invasion of Taiwan, through any means, will likely not be a cakewalk. Unless the most important objectives as outlined in the article (decapitation) succeed.<br></div>

This would mean that units such as SOF, Commando, Guards would be involved rather than the SIR units.

            <div class='col-md body'>Supposing our worst case scenairo happens and Malaysia successfully occupies Singapore, how exactly is our much-vaunted ally, the US, going to come to our aid? When Iraq invaded Kuwait in 1991, the US built up its forces in neighbouring Saudi Arabia for almost a year (Operation Desert Shield) before launching Operation Desert Storm. But our Muslim neighbours would NEVER allow the US to launch a major war from their territories. So, even if the US wanted to liberate an occupied Singapore, how are they going to do so? Deploy Marine Expeditionary Forces from Guam? Airborne insertion by the 101st or 82nd? Even then, they are all lightly armed forces with only light armour and arty and would not last against an overwhelmingly superior force. Just to point out that even if the US wanted to liberate us, it would be very difficult. Unless Malaysia really pisses the US off and the US pressurizes Thailand (long-time US ally) to launch armoured units from southern Thailand. Not a very likely scenairo though. All in, I don't think Singapore can count on the US or anybody to come to our aid in the event of an invasion. They may be able to provide air and naval support but definitely not land forces. And remember, wars are won or lost on land.<br></div>

Probably in conjunction with electronic attacks on the Malaysian armed forces' communications and sensors (such as radars), the SAF would first attempt to establish air superiority by devastating the Malaysian air force on the ground (in the first few hours of any conflict), before mounting further air strikes againist other military targets. Singapore's army would then seize the initiative on the ground, with Commandos-infiltrated by air and sea-and helimobile Guards units securing the Malaysian side of the Causeway (in Johor Bahru) and the 'second link' bridge (to the south-west of Johor Bahru). Combined arms forces, most importantly armoured battle groups equipped with light tanks and other AFCs, would then cross into Johor and conduct a rapidly paced advance into the peninsula, supported by Guards battalions and their associated RSAF transport helicopter squandrons. RSAF strike aircraft and armed helicopters would provide close air support.'<br>---Tim Huxley, <span style="font-style: italic;">Defending the Lion City </span>(59)<br><br></div>

If Singapore has fallen, there's not much point in carrying on the struggle aka Iraq or Somalia. With no food and water, the Malaysian army does not have to engage in bitter FIBUA with remnants of the SAF. It just has to pinpoint and isolate pockets of opposition and wait out the war, like how the US encircled Iraqi cities instead of entering them during the invasion last year. Of course, I'm not sure how effective this strategy would be since, unlike Iraq, Singapore is so heavily built-up. The MAF may really have to do FIBUA if they kena heavily attacked by us with MGs, LAWs and mortars and got no place to take cover. But still, given our resource constraints, we wouldn't put up too long of a fight. Political will wise, I'm not very sure. We have a pragmatic nature and would not have the stomach for heavy casualties. However, since the invading hordes may bloody well rape our women and rip us bare (think the anti-Chinese riots in Jakarta 1998, except on a bigger scale), I think I would fight. Indeed, I feel those NSmen with families would really fight in wartime since everything they have is here.</div>

Occupation zone in southern Johor would be crazy. How to man? I NSman liao leh. Wait kena recall from job/studies to do duty there and maybe even die there. Morale will fall and the economy seriously affected. An occupation zone in southern Johor would transform Singapore instantly into the Israel of Southeast Asia, as Huxley pointed out. We compare ourselves to Israel all the time but c'mon on, we haven't really experienced what it's like to fear being killed by a suicide bomber everytime we take a SBS bus or go Orchard. Israel pulled out of southern Lebanon for a reason. We shouldn't be stupid enough to repeat that lesson. Hence, Singapore doesn't really have any strong reason to fight an offensive war since we realistically cannot expect to occupy any territory from our neighbours.</div>
