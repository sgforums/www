            <div class='col-md body'>Below is the attached text from the web:<br><br>&lt;&lt;<br>Launch of HMS SÃ¶dermanland after Upgrade<br><br>(Source: Kockums AB; issued Sept. 8, 2003; web-posted Sept. 12, 2003)<br><br>Â“The new threats that confront the Swedish Armed Forces will demand some radical changes. We shall implement this process of change while simultaneously ensuring that the defense materiel we adopt maintains a high technical standard. The modernization of the submarine HMS SÃ¶dermanland provides just one example of this determination.Â”<br><br>So said HÃ¥kan Juholt, Member of Parliament and Chairman of the Swedish Defence Committee, when officiating at the launch ceremony for HMS SÃ¶dermanland, held at 11.00 a.m., September 8th, at Kockums in Karlskrona. <strong>The submarine has undergone an extensive modernization and refit, including installation of the Stirling AIP (Air Independent Propulsion) system, which enables her to remain submerged for weeks at a time, avoiding the need to surface and risk detection.  </strong><br>HÃ¥kan Juholt MP went on to stress the following: Â“More than 50 percent of the Swedish defense budget is invested in research and the procurement of advanced materiel. In international terms, this is a high figure. It is important that we manage to sustain this ambitious level in the next defense resolution.Â”<br><br>Others attending the ceremony included the Inspector General of the Royal Swedish Navy, JÃ¶rgen Ericsson, as well as the head of the Swedish Defence Materiel Administration (FMV)Â’s Production Department, Rear Admiral GÃ¶ran Larsbrink, with other representatives from the Defence Department, the Armed Forces Headquarters, the Navy and FMV (the Swedish Defence Materiel Administration). <strong>Guests from Singapore also attended the ceremony.  </strong><br>The modernization of HMS SÃ¶dermanland and her sister vessel, HMS Ã–stergÃ¶tland, signify a major advance in the effectiveness of these submarines. They have also been modified in line with the demands of international missions. All five Swedish Navy submarines currently in active service are being equipped with KockumsÂ’ Stirling propulsion systems.<br><br>Commenting on current developments, Kockums CEO Martin Hagbyhn noted: Â“We at Kockums are specialists in stealth technology, on and beneath the surface. The submarine is one element of a broader concept that we have developed. A concept whose timing has proved absolutely right, given the current threat scenario and at a time when armed forces throughout the world are in the process of readjusting to accommodate these new demands.Â”<br><br>Â“Here in the Baltic, in close association with the Royal Swedish Navy and FMV (the Swedish Defence Materiel Administration), we have developed a Maritime Security Concept for littoral waters, what we call Â‘shallow watersÂ’. It is precisely this type of shallow water that is subjected to increased threats, and this concept is now in international demand,Â” added Martin Hagbyhn.<br><br>In his own address, Rear Admiral GÃ¶ran Larsbrink, from FMV, focused on the technical advances implemented as part of HMS SÃ¶dermanlandÂ’s upgrade. Â“The Swedish Navy submarine HMS SÃ¶dermanland was designed at the start of the 1980s for a service life of some 20 years. Over the years, however, new demands and threats have arisen, that have had to be met.Â”<br><br>Â“The most radical change is that HMS SÃ¶dermanland has been fitted with a Stirling AIP (Air Independent Propulsion) system, featuring the latest MK3 version. A new climate control system permits cooling/heating/dehumidifying of the air onboard, as well as providing cooling for engines and components. This means that the surplus heat generated by the various onboard systems can now be recycled and used to heat colder areas of the vessel. This reduces battery usage.Â”<br><br>Â“A number of active and passive sensor systems have been modified and or replaced with new systems that offer improved performance. Completion of the diversÂ’ decompression chamber permits entry or exit of divers while submerged,Â” noted Rear Admiral Larsbrink in his address. He also referred to the large number of advances in marine technology that have been incorporated in the upgraded vessel, citing hydraulics, air systems, water systems and corrosion protection, as well as improved availability and reduced maintenance costs.<br><br>The air-independent auxiliary system provides dramatic tactical and operational gains, greatly enhancing the vesselÂ’s effectiveness. Measures have also been taken to reduce noise, in conjunction with a considerable improvement in the vesselÂ’s own search and acquisition capabilities. The submarine has been extended by 12 meters to 60.5 meters, increasing its displacement by 430 tons, to 1500 tons.<br><br>-ends-<br>&gt;&gt;<br><br>It is a known fact that SG is working with the Swedish on submarine R&amp;D work. This might be a the result of that and also a good upgrade option for our submarine .<br><br>Since Sg representatives are invited for this ceremony, it might mean two things:<br>1.either sg is involved with the upgrade from the the start or<br>2.that they wanted to sell this upgrade option to RSN.<br><br>Either ways, it means that this upgrade option is feasible for RSN's submarine.<br></div>

Most of the problems can be trace back to 2 major attributes, Australian lack of submarine building and combat system integration skills and Swedish lack of building ocean going sub skills.<br><br>The Australian company did relatively well in such circumstances not without massive help from the US (GE Boats) though.<br><br>The Collin class design were based on a scaled up A-17 design with greater integrated combat systems. Problems were identified in the area of:<br>1.  the cavitation noise from the sub hull (design problem), which resulted in US modifying the sail with an added curve to smooth out water flow, etc.<br><br>2. Propeller generated cavitation noise. Redesign of the propellers with US help again<br><br>3. Integrated combat systems design locally with Swedes help were not performed as well. After the purchase of Kockum by HDW, the German wanted to rectified that but the Aussie govt had already engaged US Navy for help resulting in Raytheon getting involved in a redevelopment of the combat system<br><br>4. Periscope problem. Resolved quickly.<br><br>5. Disael engine problem. Resolved.<br><br>6. Burst pipes which flood 1 compartment. Problem traced to welding quality done in Sweden.<br><br>etc.<br><br>I won't say, therefore, Kockum sucks. On the contrary, they are good, but they still lack significant skills in developing subs for different environment from the Baltics. The German with that U209 and the French with the A209 Agosta seem to fair better.<br><br></div>

It will be an overkill. It is not as if we have 20+ operational subs and need 4 subs to train the crews. I wonder how many Navies in the world (less the major powers) have 4 subs for "training".<br><br>Our 4 subs are operational subs, And we also have a new sub-surface command center or something (in the Straits Times). Why bother to have a dedicated command center for submarines if the subs are only used for training. I think they are classified as "training subs" to mitigate the impact of operating submarines before our "neighbour".<br><br>As to whether they are to be upgraded or not, I don't know. But I am sure when they "tropicalized" the subs, the RSN would have put all the gizmos that they want into the subs.<br><br>The subs are relatively "new" in that they are only recently refurbished. It may not make sense to upgrade them so soon.<br><br>I think going forward, we will probably buy another 4 subs to form another SQN.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>This topic was actually discussed a couple of years ago in another forum. Does anybody go to Warships1 forum on submarines? If you do, you would probably remember this guy posting by the name of Per Nordenberg, who had wrote a quite comprehensive description on the upgrade of the SJOORMEN class submarines BEFORE they were bought over by Singapore. In fact, 2 of these subs were actually upgraded in 1990~92 period with new combat systems, sonar, new diesels and likes. SO that gives you an indication of the state of the subs in RSN service, which would most likely be further modernised...</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Torpedoes is another form of artillery shell or missile but fired from below the sea using the submarine as a platform (instead of an artillery gun, tank, multi-rocket launch system, or from an airborne platform).<br><br>An extract from the followings website will give information on the current design of torpedoes:<br><br><strong>Torpedoes</strong><br>The torpedo has been the staple weapon of submarines since WW I but it is now a much more sophisticated and reliable device than back then. No longer a 'point and shoot' weapon the modern torpedo is almost always wire guided with its own sonar built in for the terminal homing run.<br><br>Propulsion is either via the traditional propeller or the more advanced pump jet, with power supplied either by large batteries or the more powerful (but not very safe to be near if it leaks) OTTO hydrogen peroxide fuel, giving a maximum speed of 50 - 65 knots (92 - 120 km/h) and a range of 10 - 15 nm (18 - 27 km) at high speeds or 20 - 30 nm (36 - 55 km) at low speeds.<br><br>The 'heavyweight' torpedoes employed by submarines are about 6 - 7 m long and usually have a 250 - 350 kg warhead designed to explode on impact (best against submarine targets) or upwards from underneath the target (to 'break the back' of a surface vessel).<br><br><a href="http://www.shima.demon.co.uk/modnuke.htm#Torpedoes" rel="nofollow">http://www.shima.demon.co.uk/modnuke.htm#Torpedoes</a><br><br>----------------------------------------------------<br><br>Since the Submarines used in the Singapore Navy are purchased from Sweden, perhaps the following information taken from the Swedish Navy website will give an insight of the torpedoes used by the RSN :<br><br><a href="http://www.empire.net/~xmp/list_s-y.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.empire.net/~xmp/list_s-y.htm</a><br><br><a href="http://homepage.eircom.net/~steven/swedish_navy.htm" rel="nofollow">http://homepage.eircom.net/~steven/swedish_navy.htm</a><br><br><strong>Submarines </strong>:<br><br><img src="http://homepage.eircom.net/~steven/images/gotland4.jpg"><br>SSK Gotland Class (TYPE A19)<br><br>Kockums were awarded the contract in March 1990 to build three Gotland Class submarines, HMS Gotland, Uppland and Halland.
