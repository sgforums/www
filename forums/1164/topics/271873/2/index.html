He did it apperently because it reduces recoil by directing the recoil force of the bolt directly into the shoulder (so no rotation aka muzzle climb.). You can find Youtube vids about this, try "Top 10, Guns. M14 &amp; M16", Discovery channel show.<br><br>Why is barett's M468 not in? The whole US specs ops ASK for the round to be chambered right?
