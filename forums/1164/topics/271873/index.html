Col. Timothy Chyma, product manager for individual weapons with Program Executive Office Soldier, in an email to Military.com.<br><br>"The test results will inform the U.S. Army Infantry Center in the development of a potential new carbine requirement as part of their ongoing capabilities based assessment."...<br><br><strong>The shoot off will test the capabilities of the M4/M16 operating system against three other rifles: the Heckler and Koch-built HK416, the FNH USA-designed Mk16 SOCOM Combat Assault Rifle and the previously-shelved, H&amp;K-manufactured XM8 carbine.</strong><br><br>All three competitors use a gas-piston operating system that requires less maintenance and has demonstrated in some tests that it can fire accurately even if completely fouled with sand, dust and mud....</blockquote>2.How SAR-21 perform if it is included in the test?<br><img src="http://i86.photobucket.com/albums/k84/puzzylion2/sar212maz.jpg"><br>top--M16 magazine<br>bottom--plastic maz so u can see how many rounds left.</div>

The M4 fires using a system that redirects gas from the expended round to eject it and reload another. The 416 and SCAR use a gas-operated piston that physically pushes the bolt back to eject the round and load another.<br><br>Carbon buildup from the M4's gas system has plagued the rifle for years, resulting in some close calls with Soldiers in combat whose rifles jammed at critical moments.<br><br>According to the solicitation for the new upper receiver assemblies, the 416 "allows Soldiers to replace the existing M4 upper receiver with an HK proprietary gas system that does not introduce propellant gases and the associated carbon fouling back into the weapon's interior. This reduces operator cleaning time, and increases the reliability of the M4 Carbine, particularly in an environment in which sand and dust are prevalent."<br><br>Yet the Army has still declined to buy anything other than the M4 for its regular troops, requesting about $100 million in the 2007 wartime supplemental to buy M4s for its Soldiers.....</blockquote><img src="http://images.military.com/pics/FL_m4_043007.jpg"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Never had any real issues with SAR reliability under extreme conditions... but of course I'm saying this relative to my experience with old, end of life M-16s.<br><br>But all in all I did a section life firing where I expended 240 rounds within 10 minutes, no stoppages, no jams and the rifle was in the mud. So for gruntwork it passes my test.<br><br>AFAIK, it seems the recommended gas regulator settings for the SAR given by ST for default use are too optimistic, sometimes we got weapons with stoppages or inability to cycle until we upped the settings to the higher levels and found that it immediately became completely reliable.</div>
