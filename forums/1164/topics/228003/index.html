            <div class='col-md body'>Below is a Straits Times article about the disaster relief operation back in early 2005.<br><br>Does anybody know whether or not any of those RSN LSTs participated in the operation tried to use its bow ramp to land supplies?<br><br><blockquote>Jan 11, 2005<br><strong><span class="large">Bad weather forces SAF to airlift supplies</span></strong><br>Rough seas prevent the usual beach landings for relief forces<br><br>THE weather off Meulaboh took a bad turn yesterday, forcing Singapore Armed Forces troops conducting relief operations there to switch to Plan B - air travel.<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Instead of heading to shore on Fast Landing Craft, SAF combat engineers and medical personnel from the Humanitarian Assistance Support Group were flown to shore on a steady stream of Super Puma helicopters.</span><br><br>The sudden change in weather conditions came after several days of relatively calm seas.<br><br>Yesterday, <span style="text-decoration: underline;">rough waters prevented craft being launched from the two navy ships off Meulaboh - the RSS Endurance and the RSS Persistence</span>.<br><br>Captain Toh Keng Hoe, 27, of 195 Squadron, said: 'The weather was pretty bad. We experienced very bad sea conditions.<br><br>'The swell was very high, so there were concerns with launching and getting the landing craft off the well dock, which would be a huge safety issue and would compromise the safety of the landing craft and crew going to the beach.'<br><br>The weather was so bad that even the 141m-long Endurance, a landing ship tank, was rocking heavily.<br><br>There was an upside to the poor conditions, however. It gave those who stayed aboard the warships time off from their hectic schedules to check equipment or review operations of the past week.<br><br>Navy personnel from the RSN's 195 Squadron, who operate the landing craft, have had a busy time since the warships began unloading personnel, vehicles and relief supplies.<br><br>Staff Sergeant Max Yeo, 28, a Fast Craft Utility coxswain, for example, is up at 5am each day to prepare his craft. By the time he is done, it is close to 9pm, after which he still has to debrief his men.<br><br>On a typical workday, SSG Yeo, who has been with the navy for 10 years, can make as many as 10 trips to shore.<br><br>He said: 'The weather has not really been helpful to me. Out at sea, there's the sun and the rain, and the waves just keep coming.'<br><br>Capt Toh, the outfit's commander, agrees: 'Sea conditions have been pretty bad. The swells are pretty high. The beach is also giving us a lot of problems.<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">'There's a lot of debris and the coastal conditions are different from what was stated on the charts.</span><br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">'We are not sure where we are heading. We're really going into the unknown.'</span><br><br>Despite all this, craft operated by the likes of SSG Yeo have helped deliver tonnes of supplies that he and the crew know will help those whose lives have been devastated by the tsunami.</blockquote>Cheers,<br>Sunho</div>

Yes, the Leo2A4 can ford up to 4m with snorkel but that also have to depend on the hardness of the sea bed. If it is too soft the heavy MBT will still sink, with snorkel and all.</div>
