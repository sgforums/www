William, 34, from Perak and Captain Philip Joseph Selvaraju, 33, from Kulim, Kedah, each made 500 flying hours with the MiG-29.<br><br>-- BERNAMA<br><br>Source : <a href="http://www.bernama.com.my/bernama/state_news/news.php?id=169714&amp;cat=nt" rel="nofollow">http://www.bernama.com.my/bernama/state_news/news.php?id=169714&amp;cat=nt</a></div>

Sort of removes all advantages that they have when you make such types of human resource assignment. I hope they don't do that with our own pilots as well. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"></div>

Most of us can easily do that with every car we buy.

            <div class='col-md body'>hmm.. if i am not wrong, i read somwhere that "NATO" pilots have to achieve like 240-280 hrs a year minimum...<br><br>The RSAF was flying like 240 hrs...<br><br>i think was from Defedning the lion city....<br><br>if that is the case, a "standard" RSAF SQN pilot can achieve 1000 hrs in about 4 years to 5 years... assuming he didn't get transferred to a "staff" position during this time.... right?<br></div>
