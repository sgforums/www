One type with a low-slung chassis looks like our SAF fast attack vehicle (which looks like a beach buggy).<br><br>Another one looks like a open-topped landrover where they mounted HMGs and anti-tank missiles etc.<br><br>The British have armoured versions of their Landrovers but they only use it in very limited internal-security capacity like patrolling the streets of Dublin where the chance of encountering anything bigger than a 7.62mm weapon is very remote.</div></blockquote>ROFL!!! Dublin!?!??!<br>I believe you mean Belfast... LOL Dublin's okay - more of a student population [many mainland Chinese are to be found here..]<br><br>Times have changed, and the Landies used are mostly Riot landies.<br><br>The British used to use the Wolf [Landy], but due to a European pollution directive theyve been forced to use other types.<br><br>I agree the humvee is nothing more than a jeep - trouble is that they are using it in a role for which an AFV should be used, and thats where the call for the re-introduction of the Gavin comes in.<br>The lights are on but no-ones in..<br><br><blockquote>But in this other pic there is no question as the fellow is clearly pointing a M4/M16 type of weapon with a silencer even... And they have all the PLA insignias on their uniform.<br>Don't their camo pattern look suspiciously like SAF pattern or is it coincidence?<br></blockquote>It might just be the photo picture quality [which can obviously vary greatly] but i thought it was more US Woodland camo pattern, copies of which ive seen before in PLA use.<br><br>With them using an Armalite-deriative weapon, this raises lots of questions..<br>particularly as to how any Aliied force engaged against the PLA would be able to work out who is who, disregarding the insignia.<br>The big issue was that previously, you could work out who was the OpFor and who was friendly simply by weapon sight and sound recognition [okay, this is less of an issue now with so many Allied forces using AK variants etc] but this means that on simple sight [say, silhouetted] you would be hard pressed to work out if they are US or otherwise..<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>When I lived in HK there was this Irish pub below called the Dublin Jacks... haha. Thanks for the correction, I do mean Belfast.<br><br>The PLA do not use M4/M16 derivatives in any great numbers. The pic I posted was the only one I can find of soldiers whom are clearly PLA but armed with (as you would call it) Armalites.<br><br>They are probably the PLA's OpFor or they are SpecOps training to use the enemy's weaponry.<br><br>I live in Shanghai and I have seen a few examples of Chinese-made camo that is the choice work clothes for all construction workers.<br><br>And this same one is the ones worn by many PLA units. They don't look like SAF camo and especially not the US woodland pattern. Furthermore US uniform is made of this tear-proof material that has a kind of... criss-cross pattern.<br><br>But the one pictured does look like SAF camo pattern. Even the colour matches.</div>
