            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote>Originally posted by ChineseJunk<br>The two sides will hold discussions on "<strong>bilateral cooperation</strong>,";<br>said the official who hung up when asked for his name. </blockquote>I wonder what sort of cooperation we can engage with the North Koreans. North Korea pretty much have nothing which will interest that of the Singapore government in a conventional setting as Singapore is usually interested in establishing stronger trade ties with foreign countries. Further more with an economy in shambles, there is no much to invest in too.<br><br>North Korea is known to export drugs, missile technology and counterfeit notes. As for nuclear technology, maybe not at the moment. Of all the above mentioned exports i think our government is more likely to be interested in cooperating with them over missile and maybe even nuclear technology. We will mainly provide the funding and they the expertise. Hows that sound? Feasible?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"></div>

"We need more capability. We need to speed up the deployment of additional equipment."<br><br>Kyodo said the United States had offered to provide Japan with up to 80 more Patriot missiles, as Japan seeks to speed up its own deployment of ground-based interceptor missiles.<br><br>- ENDS -</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>The ST article yesterday by David Boey mentioned that we can have two methods of tackling the threat of ballistic missiles. One is to have a sea-based platform and the other is land based system. I think it will be a combination of both.<br><br>Our frigates are armed with Aster 15 missiles which can take down ballistic missiles. I think there is room for upgrade to Aster 30 to increase the range for greater defence. The article mentioned about Standard Missile being a possible option.<br><br>I think SAF is at the stage of deciding which land based missile defence system to take up. The 2 land-based options listed in the same article include Patriot and Arrow systems. I think we will most likely be acquiring Arrow to complement and eventually replace the role of the I-Hawk missiles.<br><br>The article also touch on the threat of rocket artillery with the example of the Astros II MRLS operated by MAF. I am not sure if it is a cost effective method or even possible for Arrow,Patriot,Aster 15 or SM to shoot down these much shorter ranged unguided rockets. Assuming those are not cost effective then using a further developed THEL such as the MTHEL may be a good idea. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br><a href="http://www.israeli-weapons.com/weapons/missile_systems/systems/THEL.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.israeli-weapons.com/weapons/missile_systems/systems/THEL.html</a></div>

Bcos our Formidables are multi role, thus I think there is still room for anti-sub versions or perhaps a light air defence destroyer? </div></blockquote>The corvettes were built in the 80s.  By the time the specs are finalized, designs completed, tender/selection process, building, and commisioning, it would be well into the 2010s already.

Amongst the problems are manpower, and of course, not worrying our neighbours too much.<br><br>Maybe it might get a tad bigger, but they will probably be still termed as "frigates" ~ altho tat doesn't mean very much in today's naval world.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>

The role for the Dutch ship to play in this exercise is to provide early warning to US participants with its SMART-L long-range 3D radar.<br><br>The ship's SMART-L radar has already received 'Extended Long Range' modifications to increase the probability of detection against ballistic missile-type targets. An Aegis cruiser will assume the role of shooter with SM-3 missiles. When facing ballistic missile threats, the SMART-L may 'stare' in the direction where the missiles would come from, not rotating at all.<br><br>In a scenario the Dutch envisioned, an air defence frigate stationed off the Dutch coast could cover the whole of the Netherlands, Belgium, part of northeast France and part of southeast England against ballistic missiles fired from Iran.
