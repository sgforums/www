The people we are actually protecting are the fat-ass foreign talent and whitehorse MPs' children. Our lives (&amp; that of our family) are worthless. We made the sacrifices, but had the government actually shown us any recognition? Heck, they'd even side against us in event of industrial disputes. Remember the Alpa-S case? The pilots who do their reservist duties are thrown to the dogs. What's the point of fighting for our country when the test comes if it turns a blind eye to our contributions during peacetime?<br><br>If you can help it, leave this hellhole at the earliest opportunity.

            <div class='col-md body'>Actually not TCH fault lah, if you are the OC , PC ,CSm you dare to tekan his son and risk breaking your ricebox and with the commandos incident still fresh on everyone mind... In the first place it was never SAF doctrine to tekan recruit ........its all teh overzealous SGT , PC who inherit the tradition from dunno who... Put it this way 13 years ago , I was enlisted in Army and my Pal enlisted in police Force. His treatment was similar to TCH sons or even better no night trg for him, even as a recruit he get to go to the mess and eat tibit and watch and he is not even a WH.. My big size pal has the phsyque of a Commandos yet posted to SPF and enjoy his NS ... I am frail, weak and thin yet got posted to a shiong combat unit and suffered there.. Life is never fair sometime we are just at the wrong place at the wrong time. Lucky or unlucky</div>
