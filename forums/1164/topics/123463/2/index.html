You hid in that ditch because you think there's still hope. But Blithe, the only hope you have is to accept the fact that you're already dead.

            <div class='col-md body'>guys, lets not blast each other for opinions lar.  SAF is unfair.  The world is unfair also wad.  Look at the thousands of innoncent children dying in africa out of starvation.  What have they done to  die like that?  Nothing.<br><br>Used to be from one of those over-zealous companies from BMT, shan't name.  We get up, finish our 5bx, complete our run, and on the way marching to cookhouse, and our neighbouring companies JUST wake up only.<br><br>When we ask our csm why we are always super early, when other coys can sleep in late, he just answer, "oh, then u all can beat the traffic wad..." SAF never fails to win a middle finger salute from me when it comes to cock excuses.<br><br>Then again, most of the guys from our coy are quite proud to pass out from such a company, tho we get a lot of saigang+extras+earlier and longer than norm training.  Served us pretty well when we went to our respective units.  COs we were already mentally prepared for whatever sh!t there is to come.<br><br>Besides... ORD LOH!</div>
