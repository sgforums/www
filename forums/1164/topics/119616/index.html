            <div class='col-md body'>Since 9 DIV and HQ Infantry merged, there has been some changes to the Panther family. 3 SIR and its sister 6 SIR have been totally revemped to form "elite" battalions (more high-class than guards, no offence). Then there's talk that 2 PDF is now in charge of the Spartans and commandos are using PSR Camp.<br><br>So how is 9 DIV and subunit 10 SIB now? I have many friends who served in 9 DIV units in the late 1990s and early 2000s and it was just a normal combined arms division back then. How are things with the Panthers now?</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I remember chatting with cabbies on my way to 10 SIB (PRC). Some of them had not heard of the place and didn't know the way in. It's possible to walk, but it takes almost 40 minutes. Quite a number of them thought this unit was a reservist one. One fellow even thought 6 SIR was a Guards unit. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_surprised.gif" alt="Surprised" title="Surprised"></div>

Don't get so worked up. Even commandos also conquered more hills than cities.</div>
