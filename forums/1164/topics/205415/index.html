            <div class='col-md body'>Assuming ad-hoc fire mission--that is un-preplanned artillary,<br>and using unguided arty rounds:<br><br>1st, u need to locate your target's location on the map.<br>The coordinates is when the arty will rain down its rounds on.<br>If u get the coordinates wrong, then the arty will not hit the bunker.<br>So good topo skill is very impt (but nowadays got GPS).<br><br>2nd, raise the arty request to the proper channel. PC level can call for arty.<br>If u hv a FO (Forward Observer) attached, then he can do the job for u or u can relay your target MGR to him.<br>If not, then raise it to battlion level. Battlion has organic 81mm. Sometimes, the battlion might have the division's 155mm battlion allocated to it, then u have 155mm.<br><br>3rd, after the arty unit gets the target MGR, it needs to adjust its guns to fire on the target. The arty guns would have been "zeroed" onto a reference point in advanced once it got into position. So it just needs to offset from this zero position to get onto the target MGR. Once the guns are adjusted, then they will fire.<br><br>4th, the first salvo will land. The FO/PC will note where the rounds land and rely back on whether on target (next is Fire For Effect) or rely adjust left/right long/short.<br><br>Once the salvo is on target,  the guns will continue firing. The battlion of 12x155s will fire 6 times per request, giving u 72 rounds of 155 raining on the target! If u need more, then request again.<br><br>For planned arty mission, the targets are planned and zeroed on in advanced. Eg: enemy suspected position. The order to fire on specific targets are given codewords eg: Susan.<br><br>Once the troops are in position, u just need to give the codeword Susan and the guns will do their bombardment. Then u wait until the bombardment is completed and lifted.<br><br></div>

Then you need to zero the arty. So you might call for one round first. Then you adjust the fire according to where the round lands eg "down 100", "left 100" etc.<br><br>When near enough you call for whatever it is you wanted lor...<br><br>edit: Right, I see that you want to know how to determine the co-ord of a location? That is easy and anyone who knows anything about navigation should be able to do so.<br><br>If you know your location, and you use a rangefinder of some sort to measure how far the target is, and then you use a compass to find what what bearing the target is relative to you, you will with the aid of a map be able to find the coords.<br><br>Eg: You are at xxx yyy, the target is 100m North-East. You find your position on the map. Then you find out how long 100m on the map. Then (maybe using a string representing that 100m) you plot out the point 100m NE of you on the map. Voila.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Not like the M203 (though the principle is smiliar), for the M203 to be used you usually have to see the target. Arty guns are aimed by observers who tell the guns the amount to shift. Of course if you are more anal you might throw in a FCS computer to calculate ambient temperature, wind, humidity, barrel wear, type of ammo, kind of fire and stuff.<br><br>Oh yeah, got different kind of arty strikes as well... I think the TOT (time on target) one is cool, by different batteries stagger their firing under carefully calculated intervals so that all the salvos from all the batteries will arrive at almost the same instant. The effect can be more tremedous compared to rounds falling on the target over a longer period of time.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><br>For arty, they don't have to be very accurate.<br>Eg: For 155, their 72 rounds are to land within a 50m by 50m square, within a minute. So that should be devasting enough for open troops.<br><br>At the division level, the fire support assets would have been planned and allocated in advanced. Division has 155. But no pt division commander hold onto it since he's not likely to be near the front. So he might allocate to the pt battlion.<br><br>In addition to organic 155, there is still the air force's 50-70 F-16s to support the 3 main Divisions and now, the apaches. The air supportwould probably be called by the FO, who would probably be stationed to travel with the pt battlion.<br><br>So once u encounter resistance, the SOP is to call in fire support to pulverise the target first, before moving in.<br><br>Oh, don't forget in a division level move, there are also fire support from the tanks from the SAB.<br><br>For a bunker, I wouldn't call arty indirect fire on it. I would go with direct fire.<br>I would try with the good-old (indeed old) 84 Carl Gustav. Our LAW might be worth a shot as well. If not, can try using the bunker-busting battlion level Milan (hope it works). Else, call in the Bionixes.<br><br></div>
