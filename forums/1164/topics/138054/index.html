            <div class='col-md body'><strong>Allegations of abuse levelled at SKorean military over nude photos</strong><br><br>SEOUL: Allegations of abuse were levelled at the South Korean military and police after nude photographs of soldiers and riot police appeared on the Internet.<br><br>The Marine Corps said it was opening an investigation after newspapers published photographs of nude recruits on Monday.<br><br>"We believe the photos have been taken not just for fun. They clearly violate human rights of young people who are on military duty," the JoongAng Daily said in an editorial.<br><br>Two-year national service is mandatory for men over the age of 18 in South Korea. Some choose to serve outside the military, as riot police.<br><br>The photos of the riot police were taken during a promotion celebration at a police barracks in Wonju, 105 kilometres (90 miles) east of Seoul, last September.<br><br>"Since the pictures of naked policemen have spread out through the Internet, we have been looking into any possible human rights violations or rigor actions (bullying by seniors) in police barracks," said a police spokesman in Wonju.<br><br>A Marine Corps official said it was investigating the nude photos of soldiers that had reportedly been posted on the Internet by a discharged marine.<br><br>In one photographs raw recruits trying to covering their genitals with their hands were forced to stand naked on a snow-covered drill ground as a senior stood by holding a stick.<br><br>Bullying has long been recognized as a problem in South Korea's conscript forces. Revelations earlier this year that a soldier had been forced by a senior officer to eat excrement triggered outrage.<br><br>Last week a 22-year-old army private who killed eight soldiers and wounded two others in a shooting rampage said he acted because his seniors had bullied him.<br><br>- AFP/ir<br><br></div>
