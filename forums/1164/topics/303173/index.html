(please let's not get into an argument of rigidity in training).<br><br>There may be a difference in PDF SOP since not all your troops have the necessary basic training in all section/platoon arms.  Mono-intake and/or ITD units have soldiers who are cross trained in all section level weapons ... which is why we have appointment holder = fixed weapon issued.</div>

Delta Coy goes under support arms attached.  At higher levels, support arms will include signal plt/coys, MP, med coys, etc ...<br><br>By 4 coys, I mean the really old, British Commonwealth derived Battalions with 4 line infantry coy (+ further support elements).<br><br><blockquote><strong>The GPMG/s belonged to the Coy but is attached to the Platoons but I can't remember how many GPMG teams each Coy had.</strong></blockquote>3 MG teams per Coy.<br><br>The old orbat, as you've mentioned, had all the MGs in an MG section under HQ, although, as you've also mentioned, operationally they tended to be parceled out to the platoons anyway.  Orbat different but tactically pretty much the same.<br><br><blockquote><strong>I can't remember how many Sections per Platoon.<br>I THINK it was 3 Platoons per Coy.</strong></blockquote>3 Sect per Plt.<br>3 Plt per Coy<br><br>Has never changed.  Again, do not get confused by HQ and support elements.    When we mention 3's and main composition, we only talk about the line units/maneuver elements.<br><br><blockquote><strong>I can't remember how many men per Section.</strong></blockquote>See if you can recall if there were soldiers carrying M16 and nothing else (other than SecCom).  If there were, than it's 9MS.  This is dependent on your men carrying all their issued weapons outfield.  If someone conveniently "forgot" their LAW tube than it'll screw up the Picture.<br><br>Basically, in a 7MS, other than the SecCom, everybody else is carrying a support weapon - be it a M203, SAW or LAW.<br><br>In a 9MS, besides the SecCom, there are 2 other rifleman (incl 1 SS) who aren't carrying anything else.</div>
