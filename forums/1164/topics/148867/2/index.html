They may both do the same job, but they do it very differently.<br><br>In terms of range, you can see the the bigger MLRS rockets have big range advantage over the howitzer.<br><br>(Of course, arty is more accurate.)<br><br>But the reason why the Germans in WW2 feared the Soviet rockets - called Stalin's Organs - is not range.<br><br>It's the sheer firepower of a rocket barrage.<br><br>One ASTROS MLRS launcher can fire off all 16 SS-40 180mm rockets within (estimated) 6 seconds.<br><br>So 10 MLRS launchers can impact a target with 160 rockets within 6 seconds!<br><br>10 155mm howitzer with 3-round burst capability can deliver only 30 rounds in the first 6 seconds.<br><br>The initial 6-second barrage will catch most people before they can take cover.<br><br>The MLRS will not have to reload and can move away to safety immediately after firing to escape counter fire or air attacks.<br><br>However, the howitzer is capable of accurate, sustained fire on an objective whereas the MLRS is more suited for one-time-only saturation of an area. This is because a MLRS takes forever to reload.<br><br>The Malaysians have the MLRS as it is a good weapon for destroying our airbases. I don't think they'll waste the expensive rockets on our HDB estates. The Malaysians may go to war with us but they are not terrorists.<br><br>I don't think SG need MLRS.

This single act alone ensured Israel's success as the Arabs lost many following land battles cos they had no air cover.<br><br>Here's a possible scenario for SG and MY:<br><br>Tension between 2 countries. No one made the first moves yet besides verbal threats and general mobilisation and military build up along the border. But each country is paranoid the other will make the first move. SAF's aggressive doctrine of Forward Defense does little to placate the Malaysians. MAF decides to do a little "Forward Defense" themselves.<br><br>One morning, SAF radar screen and other intel suddenly reports 30 RMAF warplanes airborne and heading for SG.<br><br>RSAF and AA scrambles to face the aircraft threat.<br><br>But at the same time, radar shows 320 rockets heading for Changi, Tengah and Seletar Airbases. All are fired from 20 scattered launchers about 70km away.<br><br>And, yes, their artillery and mortars also zero-in onto our airbases.<br><br>Let's say within 2 minutes of the MLRS travel time, 20 of our warplanes manage to take off before the airbases got hit. Another 10 are already on air patrol. The 30 RSAF planes slaughtered the RMAF air assault. Some go on to attack targets in MY.<br><br>Immediately after taking off, the 3 airbases are showered with over 300 rockets cratering the runways and destroying other facilities and unsheltered aircrafts. Some of the warheads have delayed fuses making runway repair work hazardous.<br><br>So the problem now is the airbases are out of action and those that planes are airborne have nowhere to land. Some use the converted expressways while others head for the sanctuary Thailand.<br><br>I have no idea what will happen next but this is the first 20 minutes of H-Hour.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Long Shot is coupled with a conventional bomb to increase its range. It is not the same as cruise missiles like Tomahawk as these improved bombs do not have their own power source, lack the sofisticated guidance system and range of the Tomahawks.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Honestly, I think we'd have UAV coverage even before hostilities commence.  After that, its just picking out the smoke plumes.<br><br>Is it not possible for CIWS to gun down rockets?<br><br>Rockets are essentially Unguided projectiles.  The longer the range, the more inaccurate it is.  It really isnt' meant for precision strikes against mainland singapore if u think about it.  More like, clearing out an area where troops are likely to pass through or converge.<br><br>If they really do decide to bombard our housing and residential areas, then they'd be wasting their aces on something somewhat inconsequential and likely to piss us off.  They know we'd be hunting for em launchers and likely to kill them before they can make off their 2nd volley.<br><br>Unless they use guided rockets (if they exist) to target our runways,  i'm guessing they'd have to be about 40km in order to increase the accuracy and the saturation of bomblets on our runways. That would put them in range for counter-battery fire.   And a quick run from our Apaches.<br><br>In order to minimise the amount of damage we sustain, our best bet is to sever their communications totally.  Adding to that,  waging all out electronic warfare to confuse the chain of command totally.  How to do that... is up to imagination I suppose.</div>
