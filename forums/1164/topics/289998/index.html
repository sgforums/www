            <div class='col-md body'><strong>PART TWO - Why the M4?</strong><br><br>So if logistically it made sense to go for the M16 system, why pick the short M4?<br><br>Two things happened during the time of the Steyr service:<br><br>A:  MAF becomes increasingly mechanised.<br>B: MAF learns the value of a short weapon with scope mounting.<br><br>"A" needs no explanation.<br><br>Now "B"...<br><br>There are 2 types of settings in Malaysia, rural and urban. And rural usually means jungle. So the average MAF soldier will primarily be fighting well under 200m.<br><br>For this, the M4 is MORE THAN ADEQUATE.<br><br>And if you have a smalll, light weapon that enable your troops to be very nimble in the jungle or urban, that's tactically more useful than a long weapn that can shoot at 300m or 600m.<br><br>Some of you say bullpup is the best solution. Well, they tried bullpups and for some reasons, they've decided they don't want anything to do with bullpups anymore.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>And now the question of the M4's killing power.<br><br>There will always be some incredible sories of people shot multiple times, blown up, burnt etc etc but keep fighting. Even in WW2 when everyone is using big calibre rifles this happened. In IDF there was one guy who was carried to the hospital with an unexploded RPG grenade stuck in his body. The doctor who did the succesful operation got a medal for bravery or something.<br><br>And then there are people who give up the ghost from one little .22 wound.<br><br>In battle you worry first about hitting the enemy, because that's not easy to do especially in jungles where you can't see the enemy. 90% of the time someone who's shot stops fighting.<br><br>...<br><br>And we are forgetting the most fundamental thing;<br><br>The M4 is NOT the only weapon in the section.<br><br>They have M203, LAW, SAW, sniper/sharpshooters just like everyone else. And these weapons allows them to cover the distance or do the jobs that the individual Rifle cannot.<br><br>These are the things that affect the outcome of a battle. Not the velocity of the bullet the few M4s in the section are putting out.<br><br>...<br><br>Even the excellent Australian troops in Vietnam admitted that it is the VOLUME of lead you send that is more important cos 90% of the time they can't see the enemy and vice versa.<br><br>So this makes the case for troops carrying more explosive area weapons like grenades, M203, LAW and even the radio to call for arty, a heck of a lot more important than the length of the barrel of the Individual Rifle.<br><br>A small, light rifle like the M4 also allows me to fit more useful gadgets.<br><br>A small, light rifle allows troops to wear body armour, carry LAW, radio, hand grenades, more ammo, more GL grenades, claymore mine etc etc.<br><br>...<br><br>The scope-equipped Steyr AUG iwith 30rd weighs about 4.3kg.<br><br>A similarly equipped M4 package is 1 kg lighter. And the scope will be much better than the standard AUG scope.<br><br>One kg is equivalent to 2 extra mags or 60 rounds of ammo. My choice is obvious.<br><br>...<br><br>And finally, my favourite quotation from some grizzled old Marine sgt: "I've shot folks with .22, 9mm, 5.56, 7.62, .45... they all died."</div>

At that range, very hard to hit, + hit already not fatal unless you hit head.<br><br>Jungle fighting under 200m is tio ambushed liao, I don't think you want to be caught in that situation or unless you are trained in laying ambushes. If not stay at 300-600m away from the enemy, and use UAVs or other detection equipments(NV,thermal,motion etc etc). This is modern warfare, no longer rushing towards each other and hoping your blind/stray shots hit the enemy.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>i actually brought this subject up to a friend who works closely with the steyr project in msia and this is his input.<br><br>since this is an inside source i'd say it has high credibility.<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">The Americans need to find someone to "adopt" their "over-produced" M4s, and we've answered the call.. Our DPM always said that we're not US followers, but think again..<br><br>Moreover, the local company who has the Steyr Project screwed-up by producing a lots of unreliable parts, including using cheaper / un-approved material to produce the parts, which caused jamming and other operation issues in the long run, and resulted in complaints and claims.. So the DPM must do something to keep the company from not loosing money to the foreigners ( I keep my finger cross on whether they loose money to someone else yah..  )..<br><br>My company tries to grab over the contract for the Steyr, but it'll not be an easy task too, as we're a Swiss/Germany company, and Swiss/German don't use Steyr.. </span><br><br>seems like we're seeing something similar to the proton case, hahaha. gisborn almost got it rite, lol</div>
