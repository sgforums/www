            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by Daniel-Lim:</div><div class="quote_body">Have to disagree.<br><br>MAF already uses the M16A1, Choosing the M4 to supplement their existing stock of M16 is the most rational decision ever made by MY.<br><br>If they pick the Tavor, or G36 etc, they would add another logistic mess to their arsenal. And none of these weapons are so overpoweringly good as to justify doing this.</div></blockquote>Wrong , M-16 was selected some 30+ years ago than abt 15 years ago, MAF selected the Steyr AUG to replace the M-16A1 in the regular army and the old M-16A1 is relegated to part timer TA.<br><br>So Steyr AUG design must be better than the M-16A1 since it was selected to replace M-16A1, at least logically, but for the case of MY , you will never know!!! <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br>So is it logical in the first place for MAF to dump the old design M-16 and then later go back to it again?<br><br><strong>Anyway, your stated that becos MAF has used the M-16A1 before and due to logistically reason, therefore it is rational to continue to use old design but upgraded M4!!!</strong><br><br>That statement will be logical if they progress from M-16A1 to M-16A2 but they did not, and 2ndly that is only evolutionary , not revolutionary.<br><br>Therefore, to be revolutionary, you can't continue to use an old design as newer AR come online, one must evaluate all that are available to make the most cost-effective and rational decision, that process could take years, just look at the US for the M-16 replacement (and yes US is also looking to replace their M-16 too) and SAF becos you are talking abt re-equiping the entire armed forces for at least 2 decades.<br><br>Therefore, one cannot be just select the old design just becos of logistical reason, if there are better design AR is available and within budget, then that will be the rational choice.<br><br></div>
