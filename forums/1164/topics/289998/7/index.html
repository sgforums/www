            <div class='col-md body'>Is it possible that we have missed some points here? Weapons procurements tend to be decided by a variety of factors. Maybe the economic considerations influenced the decision, namely the weak USD. Perhaps the Colt people showed the MAF some new equipment for the M4 which they liked and suited their future doctrine. It is possible that they wanted another weapon but this was beyond their budget. What I am trying to say is that since we don't have access to all the info in the procurements process, it is possible that other reasons may have been involved. After all, if weapons selection is based purely on military reasons with no consideration given to budget or political considerations I suspect we would see all generals submitting requests for equipment which the country may not be able to afford. I'm just guessing.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>anyway they can replace the upper receiver assemblies of M4 with the HK416 ...just minor modification.....U.S. Special Forces battalion based in Okinawa did that by buying the upper receiver and modified it in their machine shop...<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Okay, lets just sum up my view, and thats the last of it, at least from me.<br><br>The M4 is a good and established weapon.<br><br>However, whether a short barreled weapon such as it is suitable as a standard infantry issue is questionable due to its reduced wounding capability, and reduced engagement distance.<br><br>Point noted, in the jungle, one can hardly see 50 meters.  But not all combat will take place in the jungles, and even within the jungle, but there is no manueverability restriction for a full length M-16.<br><br>US Army units are still equipped with M-16A3s despite its full length, and remain to be actively engaged in FIBUA environments in Iraq and Afghanistan.  Note that they do have a mixed complement of M4s and full length weapons as well.  Of course we are not saying that MAF would equip all their riflemen with M4s... but as a standard issue, that is what one is implying.<br><br>Is an M4 the best choice for a standard infantry issue, my opinion is no.  But I guess people like me would get used to me one day, like how the old guys who converted from the M-14s to M-16s did.  I bet many of them were kicking a fuss over using "smaller" bullets.<br><br>The reason to MAF's selection of the M4, as I've said much earlier, is that they probably don't have much of a choice. There are not many systems out there that would sell their licenses to manufacture. HK won't sell the 416's license, thats for sure.  If they did, the other questions is whether MAF wants to pay that much for it?   I heard the other tempting offer they got was for the AK-101. Any details on this?</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>my guess is they are going to give the M4 to the light brigade..such as the Para or recon unit...and they will use also M16A2 for the other standard infantry battalion</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Completely unrelated to the previous posts, here is a crazy twist to the M4 story.<br><br>I have previously seen some pics of supposedly PLA troops in the jungle with M4. They were wearing camo and the old style PLA helmet with the metal cap badge.<br><br>They were covered in mud.<br><br>Though I knew that China produces M16 and M4 copies, I thought those pictures of muddy "PLA with M4" were just very dedicated Chinese air-softers.<br><br><img src="http://tuku.military.china.com/military/pic/2005-09-14/815841_674652603.jpg"><br><br>But then, I just found this pic at Defense Forum again captioning a M4-carrying soldier as PLA. So what are they up to? First they cahnge their entire line of uniform from No3 to No4 all to western style. Then they adopt the US-style helmet.<br><br>If they fight with Taiwan, just by uniform alone it is impossible to tell them apart. But they take this even further by arming their covert troops with M4s. Hmm.. what's the game plan?<br><br><img src="http://www.defencetalk.com/pictures/data/3127/targetr.jpg"><br><br></div>
