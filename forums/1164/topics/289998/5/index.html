So they are just adding more to it by getting M4.</strong></span> How many times do you want me to repeat this before you get that this is the gist of what I'm saying?<img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br><blockquote>Originally posted by gary1910:<strong><br>Firstly , they replaced their M-16A1 with Steyr AUG and then 15 years later go back the newer version of the same M-16 family , what is the logic in that?</strong></blockquote>I am not debating why they quit Steyr. I am only talking about why they go for M4 after Steyr.

Who is debating that?<br><br>But where is MAF gonna get a piston M16 license from? C'mon, we are talking about the M4 being the "best for MAF" - and not which is the "best rifle in the world".<br><br>sigh...<br><br><blockquote>Originally posted by gary1910:<strong><br>You ask what is better, I dunno which is better as I have not tested any of the modern AR, but I hv tested piston gas operated weapon, SA-80, it is easier to clean and less jamming than gas blowback M-16, this is the same feature most new AR is operating.<br><br>Then that is a lot of new bullpup which offered shorter weapon at the same effective range.<br><br>So is it possible that one of them currently available that has above features actually better that the M4?<br><br>Especially when there is quite a  number of armies replacing their M-16A1 with other weapon rather continue with the same family. </strong></blockquote>WAH....A whole bunch of meaningless words. You should be a politician.<br><br>So are you saying the MAF should get a THIRD AR system or not?<br><br>If yes, say which one.

            <div class='col-md body'>I have my doubts on whether the "shortened" M4 is more "mobile" in the jungle environments.  In FIBUA, yes, without a doubt.  But in the weeds, it doesn't really make that much of a difference.<br><br>On the contrary, the lethality of the weapon is reduced due to the barrel length. The round doesn't tumble and fragment (if not at all, not as much) as much as one fired from the M-16.  I'm not talking about engagement distance, just wounding effects.

Too often the weapons are being chosen because they are convenient for Malaysia's politicians either because they stand to benefit from it financially, or because it suits a foreign policy agenda, (i.e. rewarding a country). The motives driving the purchase is mainly political and economic as opposed to military common sense.</div>

I am talking of their military procurements in general. Look especially at the RMAF, they are operating several different types of fighter aircraft from the Russian MiG-29N to the US F/A-18D to the British Hawk 200. Each have different training requirements, logistics, avionics etc...<br><br>Why?<br><br>Because of political factors. The original RMAF requirement was for the F/A-18D's.

Why?</div></blockquote><strong>Shotgun</strong>, look at the quality of Singapore's politicians compared to Malaysia's. From qualifications to experience they are better prepared because Singapore operates on a long-term plan not on an ad hoc basis like Malaysia. Mr. Lee Kuan Yew decided when Singapore was expelled from the Federation that the only way for it to survive without natural resources was to be more efficient than any of its regional neighbours. It was also vital that transparency and the rule of law was upheld which makes Singapore extremely attractive to investors. In the case of Malaysia the planning changes everytime a politician comes into office. Is Malaysia a manufacturing hub? A tourist destination? a centre for agricultural excellence? An educational hub? IT centre? To this day I have absolutely no idea what the model is. Furthermore, especially under Mr. Mahathir corruption has taken root among Malaysia's politicians. This has a terrible effect when it comes to planning and efficiency. Personally, I think the turning point for Malaysia probably came from the early death of its second PM Mr. Razak and his successor Mr. Ismail. In the case of Mr. Lee Kuan Yew he has had time to implement a proper succession and also exposure for the generation that would take over. In the case of Malaysia the generation that took over came to power too soon.</div>
