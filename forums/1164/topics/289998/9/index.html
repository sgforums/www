Since its introduction in 1991, the M4 carbine has proven its worth on the battlefield because it is accurate, easy to shoot and maintain. The M4's collapsible stock and shortened barrel make it ideal for Soldiers operating in vehicles or within the confines associated with urban terrain. The M4 has been improved numerous times and employs the most current technology available on any rifle/carbine in general use today.<br><br>The M4 is the highest-rated weapon by Soldiers in combat, according to the Directorate of Combat Development, Ft. Benning, Ga. In December 2006, the Center for Naval Analysis conducted a "Soldiers' Perspective on Small Arms in Combat" survey. Their poll of over 2,600 Soldiers reported overwhelming satisfaction with the M4. The survey included serviceability and usefulness in completing assigned missions in Iraq and Afghanistan.";<br></div></blockquote>Dude ...

One source noted that the first dust test new M4s had 9,836 jams in 60,000 rounds Â– almost one jam every 6 rounds. The Army kept working on the test until they figured out a "generous lubrication" approach that used far more than the manufacturer recommended, but lowered jams to 1 in 88 rounds.</blockquote>Even at 1 jam in 88 rds, it mean that every contact, there will be at least 1 jam or more.<br><br>Anyway, I do hope that they will be releasing results of all those tests.</div>

Since all troops operating in Iraq and Afghan are mounted, troops issued with M16 may decide to draw a M4 from the armoury for certain missions or becos the vehicle is cramped etc. Or the grenadier may choose the M4/M203 cos it's lighter, while his section mates stick to full length M16.<br><br>They're at war, not on parade. So uniformity is less crucial. And as stated, more and more choose the M4 over the M16 given the choice.</div>
