            <div class='col-md body'>Throughout my NS life in the infantry, I have fired thousands of live rounds through old training M16 rifles. As an estimate, I've had less than 20 IAs in total. Not great, but hardly as bad as all these reports make it out to be. And the weapons I used were, I emphasize - old, worn out training weapons.<br><br>The desert has differernt demands on a weapon. The talcum powder sand gets everywhere into the weapon. Even the great FN FAL didn't work for the IDF in the desert. But guess what the IDF was most happy with longest? The M16 system. But MY isn't a desert. Duh?<br><br>Furthermore...The US Army was a frustrated one in Vietnam, Iraq and Afghanistan. No wonder they bi.tch so much.

Theirs is a very small professional force. They are all well-trained jungle fighters.

The M4 is a good weapon without a doubt.  Its compact design suits SF units well given their range of operations and offers modular capabilities for whatever needs required.<br><br>But as a standard infantry weapon?  Its quite questionable due to its limited engagement distance.<br><br>The problem with the AUGs in M'sia was largely due to their locally licensed manufacturers.  Its their people.  Not the design or weapon fault.  </div></blockquote>Heard a rumour that one reason the AUG's were replaced by the M4 was that no further developments/improvements were planned for the AUG. But don't know how true that is.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I'm a very obstinate person ???<br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br>Firstly I've already stated 2 point which you guys acknowledge:<br><br>1) Gas blowback has higher frequency of jamming and need daily maintenence.<br>( also higher wear and tear as reported in the article below)<br><br>2) M4 has less effective range due to shorter barrel.<br><br>But you guys ignore the above points as if they dun exist!!!!<br><br>The article I have posted clearly stated :<br><blockquote>The contenders participating in the upcoming test use a piston-style operating system, which relies on a gas-driven piston rod to cycle the weapon during firing.<br><br>By contrast, the M4 uses a gas tube system, which relies on the gas created when a bullet is fired to cycle the weapon. Weapons experts said blowing gas directly into the receiver of the weapon <strong>spews carbon residue that can lead to fouling and heat that dries up lubrication and causes excessive wear on parts.</strong><br><br><a href="http://www.armytimes.com/news/2007/09/army_rifletest_070920/" rel="nofollow">http://www.armytimes.com/news/2007/09/army_rifletest_070920/</a></blockquote>Then you stated that it is it logistical reason, which dun even stand in term of MAF.<br><br>Then you Chino bought inferior 5.56mm ammo, which atm still no new standardised ammo, so a moot point.<br><br>Then you guys stated that due to most SF units are using M4 therefore it must be good, but the fact is,  most US SF units are now switching to H&amp;K416 and discarding the M4.<br><br>Those switching over becos they dun think the M4 is good enough , therefore switching over to H&amp;K416.<br><br>Now again , you ignoring the changes of weapon in US SF units , instead stated that the UK , OZ SAS still using the M4, therefore it must be good.<br><br>But let me ask you guys, what if those SAS units will also switch over to H&amp;K 416 too, will it happen?<br><br>I will not be surprised, since the 416 is still relatively new, the SAS units may be slow at adopting it , but they will certainly look closely on the US SF units that are using the 416, afterall the Delta force purposely collaborated with H&amp;K to come out with 416, so based on f/b from them and their own evaluation, I will not surprised they too will switch to 416!!!<br><br><strong>Then will you guys ignore the above and come up with more excuses?!?</strong> <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br>So who is being obstinate???<br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br>Lastly as I asked you guys is there any army using M4 as a <strong>standard infantry AR</strong>???<br><br>Remember the operative word is <strong>standard infantry</strong>, not SF.<br><br></div>
