The IDF had the M4 on widespread issue. THough I won't quote IDF as an example as they seldom officially standardise anything.<br><br>I though it was good enough to quote that the SAS of 3 countries use it as standard. But apparently, this holds no water for gary that the M4 is indeed a very good weapon despite certain US army members making noise.<br><br>The IDF used the M16 system in the desert as the weapon of choice over other system for decades without problem.<br><br>...<br><br>The US army, complain after a one or two years.<br><br>They also only started complaining as the battle in Iraq got bogged down and the troops became frustrated. So go figure.<br><br>So some experts looked into the problem and found that the jams happened to previously unfired weapons. So this had nothing to do with the so-called "gas problem". It was a combination of sand and the wrong lubricant the US army issued.<br><br>gary as usual sticks to his guns in the face of facts.</div>

According to the solicitation for the new upper receiver assemblies, the 416 "allows Soldiers to replace the existing M4 upper receiver with an HK proprietary gas system that does not introduce propellant gases and the associated carbon fouling back into the weapon's interior. This reduces operator cleaning time, and increases the reliability of the M4 Carbine, particularly in an environment in which sand and dust are prevalent."</blockquote>since MAF is not USMC and....there may be a possibility they do this above. After all MAF tested HK 416 and XM8 after they confirmed the M4 deal. They might already know this problem (since their SF have been using it for ages)</div>

Since its introduction in 1991, the M4 carbine has proven its worth on the battlefield because it is accurate, easy to shoot and maintain. The M4's collapsible stock and shortened barrel make it ideal for Soldiers operating in vehicles or within the confines associated with urban terrain. The M4 has been improved numerous times and employs the most current technology available on any rifle/carbine in general use today.<br><br>The M4 is the highest-rated weapon by Soldiers in combat, according to the Directorate of Combat Development, Ft. Benning, Ga. In December 2006, the Center for Naval Analysis conducted a "Soldiers' Perspective on Small Arms in Combat" survey. <strong>Their poll of over 2,600 Soldiers reported overwhelming satisfaction with the M4.</strong> The survey included serviceability and usefulness in completing assigned missions in Iraq and Afghanistan."</blockquote></div>

We spent 20 years trying to get [an extractor] spring changed. They just said 'well, this works good enough.' "</blockquote>ironically Colt can manufacture the gas piston system....
