            <div class='col-md body'>I agree with Dave on the primary "wounding" effects of the 5.56.  The round needs to be travel at higher velocity such that the sudden transition from air to flesh would cause the material strength to give way and fragment inside the body.  That is the primary wounding effect.  The M4 would probably not deliver that.</div>

Our soldier's survivability will definately increase. We can prone, stand, squat at ease at 600m picking them off while they rush towards us and exhaust themselves in the process.

            <div class='col-md body'>Allow me to share the experience of how combat equipment helps you.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>You're sweating and a mixture of sweat and camo paint keeps getting into your eyes. The fact that your helmet is lopsided doesn't help... you have this night vision equipment hanging off it. The weight of the NVG unbalances your helmet. You have it because it is estab equipment and you are supposed to use it. However, most of the time, you try to push it to one side and keep it out of your way - you only wayang and use it when there are observers.<br><br>One big problem with the NVG is that it has a very limited field of view. You lose peripheral vision. It's sometimes easier to detect movement if you just stare into the darkness and turn your head and see if you can catch a flicker in the corner of your eye.<br><br>During the day, it's hard to see the screen of a PDA. The sunlight washes out the screen. At night, the glow of your screen can be seen from far far away. You need to find ways to conceal the light. Most of the time, you just leave it off.<br><br>You need to carry batteries to power all the electronics you are carrying and you silently curse every gram. You have your signal set... or maybe your runner carries it for you. But you carry backup comms (sms) or walkie talkie.<br><br>You can't prone down because you've got a map bag, bino and all sort of stuff hanging off your chest. If you have to get down. You gingerly kneel and lie down. First of all, it hurts like hell when all the stuff digs into your chest. Secondly, you don't want to sign 1206 if something falls off and you lose it.<br><br>Sometimes, you try out toys that attach cameras on your rifle and supposedly let's your shoot around corners without exposing yourself. Yup it works. But it still weighs a ton and the case in comes in weighs a ton as well.<br><br>And we are not even talking about the full 'Land Warrior" suite yet.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>i can only distinguish three features i.e. a really worn out retractable butt, carry handle and slightly longish barrel, unlike the really really short m16 commando.  i admit it could also be an m4.<br><br>the thing was the timor leste job was what? 2-3 years ago?  i thought the announcement to change over to m4 was not more than 12 months back.  it was not known whether these m4s are already in country.  if it was, it could very well be used by the special forces.  not a radio operator of a para unit.</div>
