            <div class='col-md body'>the issue come from a question by this Sen. Tom Coburn, R-Okla....it is so ironic that he is also the one who advocate the use of HK as standard AR? I wonder if HK is one of the major donater of his campaign....also it is his own initiative that a survey (not through the army, or navy..or airforce) be conducted to M4 user in both desert front (i emphasied desert)<br><br>Unfortunately Brig. Gen. Mark Brown, the commander of Program Executive Office Soldier, were not impress with the claim because ...<br><br><blockquote>Brown said he received no complaints about the M4 carbineÂ’s performance from soldiers during a recent trip to Iraq.</blockquote>Anyway a test will be conducted in this December..agains the HK and other modern AR. So thats mean there is no confirmation yet. For all i know this story about jammed M4 is exagarated by this senator who ..wink wink..maybe receive some donation by wink wink..some AR manufacturer.<br><br>i sincerely doubt on any survey done by a polititian...but i am willing to give a benefit of a doubt untill the test is over.<br><br>On the other side of the note...it seem that other M4 operator...were quiet regarding this jammed in dust thingy....its either because its not true..or its not happen that often than the one that been use in desert surrounding.<br><br></div>
