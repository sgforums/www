India had also expressed interest in working with Singapore, Malaysia and Indonesia to enhance security in the Straits of Malacca and the Singapore Straits.<br><br>'It's a welcome development. Singapore looks forward to working with our Indian counterparts in this area,' he told reporters after a meeting with Indian defence minister Pranab Mukherjee.<br><br>He said Malaysian Defence Minister Najib Razak shared his view that countries with significant stakes in the key waterways, such as the US and Japan, should also participate in ensuring their security.<br><br>A new area of cooperation between Singapore and India was the tentative agreement to jointly develop defence technologies as both armed forces modernise.<br><br>One possibility discussed was a joint research and development facility, possibly in electronics, where the work could be divided between defence laboratories in Singapore and India. Singapore does similar work with Sweden and France.<br><br>The two countries will also boost exchanges between intelligence and security agencies and facilitate exchanges in homeland security technology, such as the development of biometric passports.<br><br>Transnational terrorism figured repeatedly in the talks. India has much experience in tackling terrorism and Dr Tan said he learnt much from the Indian perspective.<br><br>The DPM's week-long visit, which will also include trips to Hyderabad, Bangalore and Mumbai, underscores the growing contacts between the two governments.<br><br>Describing India and Singapore as 'very good friends', Dr Tan said the country appeared to have reached the take-off stage with its thirst for capital and rising middle class.<br><br>'This is a very different India from the India we knew in the 80s,' he said.<br><br>http://straitstimes.asia1.com.sg/sub/storyprintfriendly/0,5578,281693,00.html?<br><br></div>
