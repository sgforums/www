            <div class='col-md body'>Anyone watched the above two documentaries? They are pretty good and they center around the early days of the US-Taliban War. Specifically, it focuses on a prison where 8000 Taliban POWs revolted and took over the prison.<br><br>Both documentaries have good footage but i prefer "the house of war". One scene that sticks in my mind was when US special forces called in an airstrike on their ally's command post!  Major screw up.  Another good scene shows some Northern Alliance soldiers trying to clear Talibans from a fire trench - Only to get flanked by other talibans!<br><br>"The Afghan Massacre" tries to build a case against the US for war crimes against the Taliban POWs. One of the main charges made against the US was that its soldiers condoned the summary execution of Taliban soldiers who had been supposed to be handed over to the UN. A great documentary too! It also provides an insight into how Afghanistan really works; the Warlords essentially run the show.<br><br>Highly reccomended!<br><br>Watch today!<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Ok i managed to find a torrent of "The afghan massacre". I dunno about the quality but i suspect it is only vcd quality. I also do not know about how legal it is to download the torrent, so EXERCISE CAUTION.
