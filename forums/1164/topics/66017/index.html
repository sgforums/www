Two police checkpoints were also torched in the attack, Somkuan added.<br><br>A major search operation was launched, with authorities contacting counterparts in Malaysia to seek cooperation on border hunts.<br><br>Thailand's five southern Muslim majority provinces have been plagued in recent years by small-scale Muslim separatist violence and what Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra has fingered as attacks led by criminal elements protecting lucrative arms smuggling operations.<br><br>The region was wracked by a spate of violence in 2001 and 2002 during which more than 20 policemen were killed, trains bombed, government offices attacked and weapons depots raided.<br><br>- AFP<br><br><a href="http://www.channelnewsasia.com/stories/afp_asiapacific/view/64711/1/.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.channelnewsasia.com/stories/afp_asiapacific/view/64711/1/.html</a><br><br></div>

(See continuing development below).<br><br>These schools were set up by the Thai Government, and if they were religious schools, they will probably teach State sanctioned syllabus and curriculum - probably in response to the radical syllabus and curriculum being taught in most un-monitored religious schools beyond the reach of both the Governments of Thailand and Malaysia.<br><br>The Thai-Malaysian border has been a sensitive area to both countries - the Thais being concerned with the Muslim insurgencies being given support by the Malaysian radical brothers in the northern Peninsular Malaysian states controlled by PAS; while the Malaysian side is concerned with the on-going 2-way smuggling of Thai rice and agricultural products that threaten similar Malaysian produce, and the smuggling of State subsidised Petronas fuel and sugar back to Thailand.<br><br>Some of the secondary concerns from the Malaysian side were the constant crossing of criminals, as well as the remnants of the Malaysian Communist Party that operate along the border area prior to their final declaration to give up their struggle in the early 1990s.<br><br>A concrete wall and barbed wired - chain linked electric fence was constructed during the mid-1980s, across the length of the Thai-Malaysian border - stretching from the West Coast to the East Coast, from the Straits of Malacca to the South-China Sea.<br><br><strong><span style="color: green;"><span class="large">Bombs explode in Pattani </span></span></strong><br><strong><span style="color: olive;"><span class="large">Disposal experts die defusing explosive </span></span></strong><br><br><span style="color: olive;"><strong>Two bombs went off in Pattani yesterday, killing two police bomb experts in the second day of heightened violence rocking the deep South.<br><br>The first explosion occurred in Somdet Phra Srinakarin park. Witnesses said a man on a motorcycle threw a plastic bag in a rubbish bin about five metres from a police box.<br><br>Ten minutes later, the bin exploded and flying shrapnel wounded Pol Sgt Prakong Khiri in the left ear. He was rushed to hospital. Doctors said his condition was not serious.<br><br>The impact of the home-made bomb in the plastic bag also damaged a nearby toilet and some shops.<br><br>Later in the afternoon, another bomb was discovered under the pillion seat of a motorcycle parked outside Pithan Panich Co in downtown Pattani.<br><br>The bomb went off as two bomb experts, Pol Sgt-Maj Boon-ek Petchsri and Pol Sgt-Maj Sarit Kateb, were about to defuse it. The blast killed both officers.<br><br>Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra said it was unlikely the two blasts were perpetrated by the same people who set fire to 20 schools and raided a military camp in neighbouring Narathiwat province on Sunday morning.<br><br>Mr Thaksin has ordered a radical review of security and intelligence standards and told the authorities to arrest the culprits within seven days.<br><br>The simultanous torching of 20 schools and the looting of an army camp in Narathiwat was most regrettable, he said.<br><br>Mr Thaksin said intelligence was flawed and under-utilised. Security agencies were working out of sync. Local communities and the state agencies were estranged due to distrust and stronger community ties must be forged.<br><br>Stealing the weapons from the Narathiwat Ratchanakarin military camp was the raiders' ultimate goal, he said.<br><br>Torching the schools was a diversionary ploy, Mr Thaksin said, adding that demand for firearms was high among bandits. Earlier reports said some of the stolen weapons were being sold to Aceh rebels in Indonesia. He insisted the arsonists who burned down the schools were not terrorists.<br><br>The attackers raided the camp minutes after their accomplices set fire to the schools across 11 districts of Narathiwat. They stole 102 rifles from the camp.<br><br>In the past, state officials assisted in weapons robberies but the arm of the law never reached them because inquiries fell short of bringing them to account.<br><br>Mr Thaksin criticised agencies concerned for being soft on the problem. They were not persistent or committed enough to press for a permanent solution. "Those charged with this duty became slack when I had other tasks on my hands," the prime minister said.<br><br>Mr Thaksin admitted the raiders were not common "bandits" and even acknowledged they had executed their plan of destruction in a well-coordinated manner.<br><br>But he said the bandits thrived on the authorities' weakness. The security agencies refused to coordinate with one another and intelligence warnings often went unheeded.<br><br>Mr Thaksin said revamping security would begin from the top. Deputy Prime Minister Chavalit Yongchaiyudh, who is in charge of national security, must preside over a host of concerted entities made up of various security agencies at all levels.<br><br>When asked why he was not transferring officials who had failed to prevent the attacks, Mr Thaksin said time was running out for those who were incompetent.<br><br>"Some loose screws need tightening. Those in disrepair will be flushed out of the system," he said. The military should have known the bandits were after their weapons, but instead had been complacent in the face of threats.<br><br>"They had the whole stockpile [to guard] but still were not careful. They had a barracks full of soldiers and still they were not careful. They deserved to die," he said</strong>.</span><br><br>for pics and map of the incident, visit the following site:<br><a href="http://www.bangkokpost.net/News/06Jan2004_news06.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.bangkokpost.net/News/06Jan2004_news06.html</a><br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>For such a large scale operation to be pulled off successfully and till now(12/01/04) still unable to crack really created lots of questions. They must have the backing of influencial people or large organisations. Suspects can be from large crime syndicates(as officially declared),muslim separatist movement(they wanted a separate muslim state away from Thailand),foreign muslim terrorist organisations such as the Al Queda(as a form of reprisal for being a strong US ally and supporting the Iraq war militarily. Another less likely suspect may be that involved Thailand's southern neighbour trying to cause unrest in Thailand so that they can reap some benefits such as new states or so that Thailand can't beat them to gain the developed nation status.The last suspect involving a neighbouring country is not likely as i don't think they want the muslim insurgency to spread into their own country especially not when the economy is just finally improving.
