            <div class='col-md body'>For your information on Oakley sunglasses:<br><br>All Oakley Eyewear meets or exceeds ANSI Z87.1 standards for optical clarity and impact resistance. Oakley has not taken additional measurements for OSHA standards. Please check with your employer for which standards may be required for use at work. OSHA Standards (--) 29 CFR, Eye and Face Protection (--) 1910.133 Federal regulated standards in which employers must comply for the protection and safety of their employees. This standard obligates employers to enforce the uses of appropriate eye or face protection when exposed to hazardous materials, liquids, vapors, chemicals or other harmful substances. It provides specific requirements of such protection allowed in the workplace. OSHA references ANSI Z87.1 as the benchmark standard for occupational eye and face protection. Section (b) (1) Protective eye and face devices purchased after July 5, 1994 shall comply with ANSI Z87.1-1989, "American National Standard Practice for Occupational and Educational Eye and Face Protection," which is incorporated by reference as specified in Sec. 1910.6. www.osha.gov ANSI Z87.1 - Practice for Occupational and Educational Eye and Face Protection Standard Z87.1 (--) 1979 American National Standard Institute is a private, non-profit organization. It includes the specific standards for evaluating factors such as impact resistance, lens thickness, projectile penetration, and optical quality.<br><br>For anyone interested in Oakley sunglasses, there is a new Singapore Oakley Forum/Fan Club.  http://www.oakley.myfirstforum.com/</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>The military specs for testing lens is based on the standard set in MIL-STD-662F 1997 and MIL-PRF-31013<br><br>The ANSI standard is also widely followed in high velocity impact standards test. Both are reputable standards and all lenses that are fit for military ops must meet or exceed them. It is to my understanding that the US Gov. (so is Australia) is moving towards the use of ESS goggles for military ops and SWAT. However, alot of existing military supplies which were issued earlier are still using Oakley's M frame.<br><br>In Europe and Israel, I've been told that the troops use NXT, but I haven't been able to confirm. Just for information - The patented NXT urethane technology was originally developed for military application as ballistic armor by SIMULA, Inc., a leader in the field of lifesaving technologies for human protection. This project began in the early 1990s when SIMULA was awarded a contract with the U.S. Army to develop a variety of lightweight armor systems. At the time, state-of-the-art materials for armor designs were polycarbonate and acrylic, which would not meet the new requirements of the U.S. Army related to weight, impact resistance and durability. With diligent research, NXT was born.<br><br>In all honesty, I think governments do not rely on a single supplier and they like to have choices and only awards short to mid-term contracts. This is why you may see a lot of brand cross-overs, where different groups of forces may use a certain brand over others. I do not see a single company having a competitive edge over others and for defence spendings, I think cost would be more relevant to the planners as long as the standards are met or exceeded.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>If you are trying to peddle Oakleys here in Singapore, it is not very safe to do so. I do not know how your arrangement works, but I know for a fact that the distributors are fiercely protective of their distribution rights and several people have already been caught and either fined, had their goods confiscated and were never allowed to sell them publicly as first hand again i.e. if there were to be sold publicly via any medium, they had to be advertise as second hand and have their seal broken.<br><br>I was told by my colleague that a couple of them run road with the people's deposit although there were a few who got away, namely because they were foreigners and were based overseas so it was easy for them to slip away. This is one of the reason why the Oakley distributor always insist on having an authorized receipt and warranty with their stamp because they are reluctant to service those who buy from such sources. Let the buyers beware.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Parallel importing is legal as long as the item is not fake. Oakleys bought from me are from Oakley US. If Sg didn't have so much price difference from US, the local distro need not be afraid too. But since they want to earn such a high mark-up, they have to bare the consequences. Parallel importing of cars made car prices lower too.<br><br>For repair jobs, certain countries need not need any proof of purchase and cost of repair is reasonable. Unlike Sg distro which is charging an arm and leg. If they provide better services, there shouldn't be a problem and they need not be worried about competition from overseas.</div>
