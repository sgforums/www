            <div class='col-md body'>Oakley M-Frames for $132 is dirt cheap. I don't believe anyone would sell at this price unless OAKLEY themselves are supplying, OR its fake.<br><br>Is Oakley M-frames already marketed in Singapore? YES. I remember making inquiries a year back or more.  Lots interest in it cos of its hefty price tag.<br><br>So far, the only SAF peeps I've only seen wearing it were from CDO and SOF.  It probably has something to do with looking garang.  But I don't recall it being a "standard issue" by SAF yet... nor is it part of some buy Oakley M's for poor regular funds.  Haven't heard of such a scheme.  I believe the regulars themselves earn enough to buy it own their own.<br><br>2ndly, i still don't see why u need to mention ur unit when u are just asking about who is marketing Oakley M Frames in Singapore.<br><br>I believe Oakley themselves supply to third party distributors to sell.  There hasn't been any major marketing or A&amp;P specially for the M'Frames.  Reason being its not a very nice looking design.<br><br>Honestly speaking, I don't really go around asking ppl wat unit they are from the forums.  1, cos it could be confidential.  2, they could be bullsh!tting.  Then again, if someone is bullsh!tting here to be SOF, i think he'd get found out sooner or later lar.<br><br>If u're from Infantry, Guards, armor etc... just say formation.  No need to be so hush hush.  If CDO or SOF&lt; just say special forces.  If u are from JID, den u will probably know wat to answer when asked in the first place instead of implying that u are from a confidential unit.<br><br>Cheers yeah?  Btw, i still reccomend going for ESS.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Oakley M-frame has been in the marketing for quite a while, but not the military version, if you understand what i mean. Both version are the same, in general, except the colour of the "O' on the arms of the glasses are different, and of course, the differences in price too.<br><br>Much agreed, $132 for a pair of M-frame is dirt cheap. Nope, SAF isn't buying it as a standard issue for all reg and there isnt such a scheme available.<br><br>Well, maybe i should change my nick to "recruit" instead <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"> . IMHO, the issue here isnt really about the Oakley (military) or whatever not, probably it's all about the nick i used.<br><br>Anyway, <strong>Shotgun</strong>, tks for your understanding. Liked i've said earlier, if members feels that it's a "hush hush" attitude, then i sincerely apologise for that.<br><br>At the end of the day, what is utmost important is that the individual must be happy or contented with what he buys or owns. Eg, i'm very happy with my Nokia 8210. Do i need to spend the extra dollars for a better phone?<br><br>Btw, how can i change my nick?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_redface.gif" alt="Embarassed" title="Embarassed"><br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>ESS shades goggles can be purchased from koolook at suntec. Usual price for ICE is abt $150.  I had  20% discount for AA2006.<br><br>while ESS may not have the nice branding as oakleys, or the outrageous lense shape of the M-frames, it still affords the same degree of protection to ur eyes.<br><br>Plus, u can have prescription lenses that can be inserted under the shades itself.  IF u are not contact lense user already.</div>
