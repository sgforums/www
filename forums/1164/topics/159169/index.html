The advantage of the HARM over the shrike, is its higher speed (around Mach 5), allowing it to outrace most SAMs, so if a fighter is fired on by a SAM, it can destroy the radar of the SAM site with the HARM before the SAM actually hits the aircraft. Other advantages are that the HARM has a smokeless motor, coupled with its higher speed, would cause SAM operators not to notice the incoming missile before its too late, preventing them from switching off their radars in time. The HARM also has an inertial guidance system, allowing the missile to home onto the last known position of the SAM radar if the SAM operator manages to switch off its radar before the missile hits.<br><br>If you look at our surrounding SAM threats, most of them are low altitude optically or infrared guided SAMs, which ARMs(anti radiation missiles) are useless against. Indonesia expressed an interest in procuring the russian S-300(SA-10) system some time ago, and ARMs would have been effective against it. If that deal had materialized, we would probably have gotten the AGM-88s. however, it did not, so we were stuck with the AGM-45s carried by the A-4s.<br><br>The rise of Chinese military power might cause us to procure the AGM-88 in the near future though, as they make use of many long range SAM systems that the HARM might be useful against.</div>
