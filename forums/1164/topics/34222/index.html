            <div class='col-md body'>actually the neutron bomb kills all living things including plants and animals as well as humans... since its method of killing is through the use of ultra high levels of radiation that will destroy all the living cells DNA... resulting in in-repairable damages that ultimately leads to death...<br><br>So far... only 2 nation has confirmed possession of neutron bomb... USA and Russia.... PRC claimed recently that it too has perfected its neutron bomb... but thus far.. there were no third party verification to back their claim... but i would rather err on the cautious side since PRC does possess nukes...<br><br>oh... it has also been noted by astrophysist that if the earth were to be in the direct path of a massive solar blast releasing immensive amount of radiation directed towards the earth... the effect is similar to being hit by 100,000 neutron bomb...</div>
