The new fighter has a completely new cockpit, with three 5 x 7 inch color displays. Behind the displays is a fiber-optic high-speed datalink, a new mission computer based on commercial technology, and a data transfer system using 30-gigabyte cartridges.<br><br>In action, the Block 60 displays share the "look and feel" of the F-22. Threats and friendlies, identified by the Northrop Grumman electronic warfare suite, by AWACS or other means, are distinguished by shape and color on the screens. A single button-push creates a "shoot list" on the right-hand attack display, assigning an AMRAAM to the closest targets.<br><br>Unlike the basic F-22, though, the Block 60 also creates a "bomb list" for air-to-ground targets or a "jam list" for electronic threats. The APG-80 radar has a variable resolution synthetic aperture radar (VRSAR) mode that allows the pilot to identify aimpoints within a target complex such as a SAM site. Again, single-switch angles allow the pilot to toggle between SAR, EW and infra-red displays.<br><br>The F-16 Block 60 is due to fly this year and the first aircraft will be delivered to the UAE in 2004. </blockquote>I would like to ask how the hell a Blk 52 can be upgraded to Blk 60 without rebuilding the entire airframe.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>How significant is the capabilities of the Blk 60 compared to the Blk52+? If our forthcoming batch of the F16s can be upgraded to the Blk52+ standard, with most if not all the stuff &amp; systems, to what extend can they measure up against the Blk60 currently being offered to the RSAF. If the RSAF can upgrade all our vipers to varying standards, eg. baseline level1 for all, then level 2 for some of the D version, and finally level 3 for the last 20, wouldn't it make more econmical sense than buying another 20 of the Blk60s?<br><br>If we will to buy the Blk60s, it would make sense in terms of logistics, training, and even maintenance. But I don't see any incremental increase in our strike capabilities. Moreover, if the RSAF is planning to replace the Vipers with the F-35, wouldn't that create something like a Block obsolescene of the entire viper fleet spread over a 10 year period, say from 2015~2025? Wasn't this one of the reasons why we upgraded the Skyhawks in the first place, when the RSAF just couldn't afford to replace the whole fleet of A4s with new gen. of fighters???<br><br>My point is, would the other contenders be a better option than the F16 Blk 60, with respect to the possible needs and requirements of the RSAF 10~15 years from now? Can it perform the roles that were envisaged for the other contenders, which ironically are all twin-engined? As much as I like the Viper, I can't see the Blk60 suitable as a replacement for the remaining A4s. Give me the Typhoon or the F15variant anytime. I believe they are more suitable for a Hi-Lo mix.<br><br>Just my $0.02 worth. Eagerly awaiting the baptisms of fire coming this way...<br><br></div>

I haven't had a good "chat" with my reli's and friend from the RSAF for a good while, so I am only feeding off public domain stuffs - which is ok <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile">.<br><br>My gut feeling says that the media (or rumor) blew it a bit too loud. RSAF hasn't officially confirmed any mod or upgrade for the Block 52 Vipers. The earliest batch of 18 is probably due for a mod or upgrade, the latest (don't count those still in the production line) are still just about 5 years old or less. So what is RSAF going to do with all the spare APG-68(V)7 radars ?? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"> I think the mod and upgrade will most likely be progressive and we will see RSAF having its own "block" upgrade <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>Still no words on the old A/B Vipers? Why not sell them to Thailand or Phillippines??? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"> Sell them cheap cheap (5 million or so per copy and I'm sure they will snap them up).  Otherwise, I can't think of a worse case scenario where RSAF will have to maintain different "variants" of Vipers, from the Block 15, Block 52 (various mod like colour LCDs etc), Advanced Block 52 and possible some hybrid mod Block 60...
