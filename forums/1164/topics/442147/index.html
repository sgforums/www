              <p>Tensions have been rising in the South China Sea over the past several years and in 2010-2011 the issue moved to the top of Asiaâ€™s security agenda. In addition to the traditional drivers of the dispute, including rivalry over maritime resources, nationalism, and attempts by claimant states to consolidate their jurisdictional and legal claims, an extra layer of complexity has been added by the increasing involvement of extra-regional powers, particularly the United States, but also Japan and India. While a major conflict is unlikely, how will a more assertive China and the build-up of military capacity affect the region?</p>
              <p>Seeing China navy to carrying out Pacific exercises</p>
              <p>China's navy will carry out exercises in the Pacific Ocean in the coming days, amid continuing tension over maritime disputes in the region.<br><br>The defence ministry said the drills were routine and were not targeting any specific country.<br><br>China is locked in territorial rows with several nations, and the US has recently made a series of announcements bolstering its presence in the region.<br><br>A Pentagon spokesman said the US had no problem with the naval exercises.<br><br>Captain John Kirby said that China was "entitled to exercise their military in ways they deem fit".<br><br>A short statement on the defence ministry's website announced the exercises late on Wednesday.<br><br>"This is an annual, planned, routine drill. It is not directed at any specific country or target and is in keeping with relevant international laws and practices," said the statement.<br><br>"China's freedom of navigation and other legal rights should not be obstructed."<br><br>Japanese defence officials reported seeing six warships sailing in international waters near the country's southern Okinawa prefecture.<br><br>China has clashed with several other nations in the South China Sea, where countries including Vietnam and the Philippines have overlapping claims.<br><br>US President Barack Obama announced last week that the US was boosting its presence in the region, and will base a full Marine task force in northern Australia.<br><br>Analysts say the US move is a direct challenge to China's attempts to dominate the area, and is likely to bolster US allies in the South China Sea dispute.</p>

              Right... provided one backs down.
              
              They're right on China's right to exercise it's Navy, as long as they don't end up treating the South China Sea as their own personal playground. The smaller countries in the area need to boost their naval power to match, not individually, but at least they must be able to pose a credible deterence as a group. Chinese behaviour in the disputed territories with Japan do not fill me with confidence. All it takes is one greedy idiotic fisherman with more greed than sense to stoke up nationalistic sentiments for total domination for things to go south fast. Pun not intended.
