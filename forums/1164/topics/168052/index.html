Considering the fact that our potential adversries do not have too many of these shelters, this purchase of 50 weapons is sufficient for the time being... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>

Though i think a designator turn isn't required unlike LGBs due to the missile having a much shorter flight time than LGBs.<br><br>Why do we use the B not D anyway? the 65D was always my favourite model...some more it can be carried in 3 per hardpoint configuration with the LAU-88 triple rails on the no 3 and 7 hardponts on the viper. The 65D is also much better for night operations, as it uses an IIR seeker head instead of just an EO head, something the RSAF has probably been focusing on...</div>

The difference is that the CBUÂ–87 carries 202 of those bomblets, whereas Joint Standoff Weapon (JSOW) carries 145. The range performance is similar. The LongShot version will attain roughly 40 nautical miles, which is the minimum stated for JSOW. On the other hand, when it is attached to a Mark 82, 500 pound general purpose bomb, it will exceed 60 nautical miles in range, which will give it somewhat greater range than JSOW."<br><br>The most attractive point..<br><br>"... JSOW, roughly $200,000 to deliver 145 bomblets. And LongShot equipped CBUÂ–87, $40,000 to deliver 202 bomblets. It performs the same mission and has the same accuracy, because it uses the same satellites for its navigational information.

            <div class='col-md body'>Exactly, esp with SAMs, they like to put the "Ba gua zhen"  Formation.   The big footprint pretty much it hits whatever thats under it.  For optimum effect, set for the CMs to deploy at 300ft for maximum footprint.</div>
