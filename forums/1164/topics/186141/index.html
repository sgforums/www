When a command is shouted during a drill, you respond immediately. In the field, when a silent hand signal is given by the commander, everyone stops and take cover. Isn't this like drilling on the square?<br></blockquote>IFC signals  are not similar to parade commands!!! That is the reson why they are classified in a category of their own.<br><br><blockquote><br>Another use for marching is when men are dead tired during long route march. The platoon will start to straggle and the slow ones will start to fall behind. A commander is able to get everyone to fall in order and move in formation again. A formation gives strength to the weaker members of the group - like migrating birds fly in formation. You can't do that if soldiers don't know how to march.<br></blockquote>The point about the psyhcological effect of the  route marching example you have given is vaild, however do understand I'm  refering to ceremonial marching being useless.<br><br><blockquote><br>And really, if soldiers do not know how to march, how are they different from mob?<br></blockquote>The Israeli army would be considered  well trained, well equiped, well supported yet they view ceremonial marching as unimportant.<br><br><blockquote><br>While there are a lot of smart people there are also a lot of low IQ folks or "kwailan" ppl in the army. And for these people, learning how to instanly obey an order starts in the parade square.<br></blockquote>Again there  are other ways to teach people to take orders. The time spent in the parade square could be spent construtively elsewhere.<br><br><blockquote><br>People running armies all over the world are not stupid. Marching has been practiced by armies for centuries and they will continue to do so. Don't knock something cos you don't understand it.<br></blockquote>They may not be stupid but they have the old school mentality that grand useless ceremonial parades are somehow suppose to instill regimental discipline.<br><br>And people like you my friend are awestruck by such superfical things that don't matter in combat.<br></div>
