Unfortunately, even the upgraded SM1 is considered obsolete compared to the its modern foreign counterparts.<br><br>SAF did not think that the replacement of SM1 is of high piority because it is more than sufficient in our regional context. Currently, even our old SM1 is a good match to the armoured vehicles which our neighbours have. However, as our neighbours increased their military budget and have plans to develop armoured divisions(Malaysia), therefore the recent stronger urgency to replace it.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"><br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I was actually thinking why not just buy the technology of the BMP-3 from the Russian and try to put a 105mm or 120mm NATO standard tank gun onto it. Many countries have already hybridised Russian and western technologies together. Besides, the BMP-3F is amphibious capable, we can modify it for the 21DIV, the MT-LB is also a good choice, very low profile</div>
