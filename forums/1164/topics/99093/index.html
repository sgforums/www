            <div class='col-md body'>To several people here who play C&amp;C, this is not an insult(i personally play it myself) but understanding that most computer games does not reflect real life. You need not be in the army to know this, i'm onli ncc, many history books and diaries by several forer generals tells you what a real war is like.<br><br>Computers games are meant to be fun, not about being real, or it may not be fun at all and the company cannot earn money. Also, ideas in RA is being ridiculous, being able to built your own tanks and army, airfoce and navy all in one. Games like this are simple and does not make much use of actual tactics and stragety. Reason is that if u are a general or admiral, you manage your own unit, saying navy fleet or a army division. You do not get the chance to built tanks and ships, if you want to built things so much , I would say sim city is just for u. In real life, you are onli allowed to used the things you have for example, a navy admiral in command of a carrier battlegroup and how to make use of it.<br><br>Beside that, you must understand that a general does not command everything, example like at tactical level, take cover, attack that building in a huge city and cover this unit. In real life, your units can think, and if you interfer too much there will be confusion. As a commander, you make descicision like strike which city, how to reach your objective, should you strike now or later, big decision not small ones.<br><br>People also would not be willing to lose a game, because it is between lige and death, you and your force can be captured or killed, this may affect you entire country, you are commanding living people, making stupid decision could be killing them. Also, there is no such things like infranty deploying and killing tanks with normal rifles or machines guns.<br><br>Super weapons is also not like what you see in computer games, like onli damaging enemy base, nukes can destoy the entire map and even larger and if you are fighting an enmy also with nukes or WMD, they could send the nukes back at you or your country.<br><br>You can't just anyhow sent enemy troops to an enemy base so easily and go inside it. a base is carefully planned and is diffcult to go inside it and wreak destrustion on it nor does a group of tanks aiming a single infranty. You also need to consider how could you capture or destroy enemy base with the least lost. In actual combat, if you capture enemy base with too much loss, you don't just win the war, your force can be weak tired and unable to fight. enemy reinforcement could eadily come and destory your entire force after capturing a base. You would also be wasting your resources .<br><br>Another thing is you must know of logistic, how your forces get ammo or weapons and food supplies. unlike computer games, you can't just sent a single infranty far from your base and start killings tons and tons of enemy just because it is a hero unit like tanya and col. bruton. They are bound to run out of ammo sometime at this rate, soon a rela life unit will run out of ammo and got killed.  You must therefore consider if you are sending your forces to places far away from your base, how to you supply them and not make them fight on their own.<br><br>Like a fleet that need supply ships and fuel in long jounery and mid-air refuelling for long distance flight.<br><br>I'm not saying that I am a expert on this matters just how I view about war-releated games. I too enjoy this games but I really hope others can understand this as well.<br><br>Others are free to response.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>The major "problem" with games are that when your army gets wiped out, you can restart from a saved point - in real life, there's no option like it.<br><br>In some games, you are given a few lifes, and therefore you can die a few times.   And even if those lifes are not enough, you can restart the game.   How does that related to real life?</div>
