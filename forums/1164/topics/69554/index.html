            <div class='col-md body'>And most of the time they just care about themselves, for regulars especially, like me, i am the type of cannot pass IPPT type, so they want to improve result of unit, then make me do all kind of extra training, the amount of which is like crazy for an unfit person anyway.  And they only do this when my IPPT window is open and these extra training stops as soon as my window closed.<br><br>As if they are sincere about training me to pass IPPT, they just want their record to look nice. In the end i just don't care about them, since when they want to burn my weekend, they have to burn theirs to stay back and train me, in the end it is I stay back, 1 officer will have to stay and train, then a sg will also need to stay.<br><br>Training fails anyway, i got reach IPPT gold in all events but fail my 2.4km. fail by 2 minutes or so.<br><br>anyway in the end it just ends with them tampering with the records to make me pass because i just can't pass.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I dun think we can compare or group CK ppl into one... cos there are many reason why they CK......so it's a very subjective thing and there's no true answer to it...<br><br>Bollywoord beng and not entirely wrong, so is the rest of us.....there are just too many reasons for them to CK....<br><br>Some are just plain lazy, some hate the army and control, some are just irresponsible, some just want a simple easy army life (smart ones), some are physically unfit (a clerk in my unit wanted to go to OCS one), some are rebelous(hate officers/sergeants and pusposely give trouble) and some are just plain blur(low IQ, serious).<br><br>so there are so many reasons......<br>my 1cent worth of pointless opinion  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"></div>
