Reducing all those indirect combatants. But I am not sure if they are increasing more frontline ... probably maintaining the same force levels for the near future. Because as a follow-up debate on the UK government annoucement, one think -tank sponsored by the government was later quoted as saying that the Afghan war will last "one generation or at least 20 years".<br><br>The fact that a think tank said this, suggests that the government is leaking info to the public to prepare the mindset that it will be a "long one". Remember that the british fought  in 2 Afghan Wars during the 19th century. They suffered then. They still remember.<br><br>My friend will be a SO ( staff officer) attached to a HQ ... and reasonably safe. His background is the RAF Regiment ( equivalent to a hybrid of our SADA and FDS).</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Because of manpower shortages, a lot of the supporting functions for the Army are also manned by RAF and RN  personnel. Apparently, the Army will request for personnel from the MOD and they will pick those that are MP, semi-infantry trained like the RAF Regiment, logistics vocation people. These chaps ( or girls !) will be seconded to the Army which is the senior command in that theatre of ops.<br><br>Friend will be one of the ops planners ( S3).</div>
