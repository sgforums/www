Most Admirals will want them in their fleet. But we couldn't afford it and it is not cost effective. Money better used elewhere.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Yep, it's not cost effective. It's cost effective only if you have a US$1.5 billion floating city, complete with its 2000+ crew, that's a juicy target for the enemy and that you need to protect. An Arleigh Burke would actually be an economical solution in that case (in fact, the Arleigh Burkes were designed as a cheaper alternative to the original AEGIS platforms, the Ticonderoga class cruiser).<br><br>Thankfully, though, since we don't have, need or want aircraft carriers, that won't be an issue for us.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>This is not a good idea as the cost of purchasing, owning, and maintaining such a ship will blow RSN budget. Even having 1 or 2 would have severely impact RSN budget. Furthermore, US will definitely NOT sell it to Singapore.  Heck, they won't even sell it to Taiwan. Furthermore, it will take about 8 years to even achieve IOC from the moment we say go.<br><br>DDG51 is essentially seen as a fleet air-defense destroyer. It will, in the future be part of US anti-ballistic missile defense. Only the Japanese and possibly the Aussies will be able to acquire such a ship. Taiwan has to contend with the ex-USN Kidd class.<br><br>Manning requirement is high. It will take nearly the entire 6 ship Formidable crew to man a single DDG51. I can't see that as the best use of resource, nor 1 DDG51 equates to 6 Formidable in our region.  If Singapore really needs ABM (hypothetical speaking), it is best served by acquiring Israeli Arrow missiles or even Patriot PAC-3.<br><br>RSN role is to seek and destroy enemy ships and protect the SLOC.<br>It is not to defend Singapore from ballastic missiles.<br><br>I do think that RSN needs more capable ships, but in the form of multirole stealth covettes or small frigates. We need high quality small vessels to navigate the congested Melacca and Singapore Straits, and the South China Sea.  In my opinion, what we need is a Visby like covette to supplement the Formidable,  while the current PVs and MCVs act as loitteral warfare ships. RSN will also need to have some latest state-of-the art submarines to maintain or regain an edge in the region. Afterall, Singapore sphere of influence is around the ASEAN region and it will never need ocean going destroyers.<br><br></div>
