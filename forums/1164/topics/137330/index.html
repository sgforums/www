It gives high deterrent value to the country," said Najib.<br><br>He also said that the government would not compromise on the quality and the four-year period of training for the RMN personnel who would handle the submarines.<br><br>He said the government would not be too anxious to take delivery of the submarines though they would be ready in early 2009.<br><br>Asked about media reports that the submarines were scheduled to be completed in 2008, Najib said: "The construction is proceeding according to schedule and they will be completed on schedule. Only the training of the personnel has been delayed a little, due to a delay in the signing of the agreement on the training."<br><br>Najib said only 31 crew was required to handle a Scorpene, the world's most sophisticated conventional submarine.<br><br>Overall, a total of 156 personnel would undergo training, he said, adding that the additional number was to accommodate the manpower needs of the submarine unit.<br><br>Najib also said that the trainees would be given three weeks of leave after every four months of training, contrary to the provision of the original contract where they would be allowed leave only after every eight months of training.<br><br>He also said that the government was looking into the payment of a special allowance for submarine crew.<br><br>Earlier, Najib visited the RMN trainees in Brest and joined them for Friday prayers at the school.<br><br>Nine RMN officers are monitoring the construction of the submarines in Cherbourg.<br><br>Asked for the names of the submarines, Najib said they were under consideration. He said the submarines would be based in Teluk Sepanggar in Sabah.<br><br>Meanwhile, DCN International Programme Director for the Malaysian submarines project, Philippe Novelli, told Malaysian journalists the forward and hull parts of the two submarines were being built here and the aft part in Cartegena, Spain.<br><br>The final assembly for the first submarine would be done here and the final assembly for the second submarine in Cartegena. Construction of the submarines began in 2003 after the Malaysian government finalised the contract to purchase them in June 2002.<br><br>Novelli said the diesel- and electric-powered submarines would be equipped with Black Shark torpedoes and SM-99 guided missiles which could be launched from below water.<br><br>"They are able to handle anti-surface and anti-submarine warfare," he said.<br><br>DCN International provides transfer of technology through training, which includes simulator and a refurbished Agosta submarine used as a platform for training. The Agosta is similar to the Scorpene submarine. The Scorpene's overall length is 66.4 metres and it has a maximum speed of 20 knots and underwater endurance of 45 days.<br><br>Also present during Najib's visit were Chief of Navy Admiral Datuk Illyas Mohd Din and Malaysia's Ambassador to France Datuk Hamidah Mohd Yusoff.<br><br>Later, Najib attended a reception with the Malaysian community here.<br><br>-- BERNAMA<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Crew quality is the most important factor that would decide the effectiveness of the submarine force. For those who are familiar with sub operation, attention must be given to every single details in operating a sub. U would need a highly motivated and disciplined crew to manned a deadly underwater weaponary system. The knowledge on the sea is very critical in "hiding" the sub from sonar as well.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Operating an effective and deadly submarine forces is very complicated task. I dun think the RMN could easily bring up the combat standard of their scopene sub in just 1 - 2 years. From the time they take in their first sub in 2009, the submarine crew will nedd 1 -2 years to horn their scale and come out with all their underwater combat tactics. Their tech will also need about at least bare minimum 2-3 years to master the technology behind the submarine. They would also need to chart out the water in the South China Sea and Meleka Straits. But I think our sub has already all these task already.<br><br>More importantly, we can do our own underwater combat drills to trial new tactics using our 4 sub. The 5th spare sub would alos our tech / engrs to familiarise with the sub technology for faster repair time and more reliability. In addition, we can try out some new innovative tech (eg AIP, new sonar, propulsion, combat system, stealth technologies) using the spare sub as well.</div>
