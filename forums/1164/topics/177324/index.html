            <div class='col-md body'>My uncle was an ex spy for ISD (they were and independent unit linked to ISD). He joined CID (He joined at the wrong time where people hated police as most of them were corrupted) and then later the "special department" till today he still refuses to disclose its name. But in his ID it stated MFA. Till today, the government has not officially acknowledge their existance.<br><br>That was in the 1950s-1970s, when their main job was to round up political dissidents, esp communist and indonesians during the confrontation. They were so secretive that even the police commisioner didn't know of their existance. Only the prime minister and several other key government officials e.g defence ministers.. knew of their existance. And yes, that includes LKY.<br><br>Trust me, theres nothing cool about it. Some of them couldn't take the stress and were transfered out. While others like my uncle had a broken family as no one knew what he was doing and he was seldom home. If he was outside, even if you recognised him, you couldn't call or talk to him. Everywhere he went, he planned his route properly and will not use the route twice.<br><br>They are highly trained in hand to hand combat and have certain knowledge of small arms (but they do not carry them). On the front they were given identities as civil servants (Ministry of foreign affairs for my uncle case) but their actual jobs were kept under wraps, and orders and assignments came directly from the top.<br><br>Till today, there is no evidence that he was once a spy. No medals, no ribbons, no special awards or commendations. Only his MFA pass and several official documents (the rest were destroyed once he retired at 45). Records only stated that he was a civil servent working at MFA from 19xx to 19xx.<br><br>He is living off the government since his retirement at 45. At first he was paid $4000 (todays money) a month for a few years. Then $2000 for 10 years, finally today only $200 a month.<br><br>His hospital bills and every single visit to the doctor is fully paid for by the government, basically a full medical cover for anything and everything. Heavy subsidy for his HDB flat and several other benefits under the govt plan to recognise contributions to the nation by ex civil servants. (they did not state the contribution).<br><br>But his wife and children left him and today he has a very slight mental disorder and tends to be extremly violent and responsive to small noises. But other than that he is perfectly normal as i've visited him this CNY. Somehow i feel that there are things that he have seen or done that led to his wierd behaviour. Whatever that is, he'll probably take it with him when he pass on. He still lives today and is 74 years of age.</div>

One had recruited the fourth to<br>collect intelligence on and to subvert an unidentified local community<br>organisation, according to the minister. Two of them have been released.<br>Said Mr Wong: "This followed Internal Security Department's<br>recommendations that their preventive detentions were no<br>longer necessary for reasons of<br>continuing investigation, or of their posing an active<br>threat to national security."<br>The four who were released from custody had been<br>detained for between four and 11 months.<br><br>Since 1965, 591 people have been detained under the Internal Security Act.<br>Most were arrested in the 1960s and 1970s in the struggle against communist<br>groups.
