            <div class='col-md body'>Maybe its due to the US culture of being able to own guns since maybe even before the Wild West times, so its hard to totally prevent civilians from owning guns privately.<br><br>Singapore on the other hand, private gun ownership will be impossible. This is probably due to the legacy of the communist insurgency back in the early days. ISA is also a legacy left from those times, which still proves relevant today in the era of terrorism. So that explains why we have very harsh laws on weapons and ammunition. Some so harsh that Westerners have a hard time understanding why.<br><br>Personally, i think that allowing civilians to own guns privately have more cons as compared to pros. By allowing civilians to own weapons, this indirectly shows the inability of the law enforcement agencies to protect the civilians. Because one may argue that if they did a good job then there is no need to own weapons for self defence.<br><br>Another reason is that the police will have a harder and more dangerous time enforcing the law as the criminals are very likely to be armed. If i am not wrong the general life expectancy of policemen in US is considered quite short.<br><br>There are also many accidents of kids killing themselves or their siblings when they play with their parents' guns. School mass shooting is also common in the US so much so that they have to have metal detectors and armed guards in the school compound.<br><br>This is a deviation from the original topic but personally i am against private ownership of weapons. Don't get me wrong, personally i love weapons and will love to have my own 'armskote' at home but this proves unrealistic especially in Singapore context.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>For a number of years now, my personal CCW sidearm has been a 40S&amp;W CZ 100 (pictured <a href="http://webpages.charter.net/dlwh/CZ100_Carry_Rig.jpg" rel="nofollow">here</a> with its holster).<br><br>Earlier this year, on a whim, I purchased a Bersa Thunder 380 chambered in 380ACP:<br><br><img src="http://i12.photobucket.com/albums/a221/screwthepap/Bersa_Thunder_380_Rightside_Small.jpg"><br><br><img src="http://i12.photobucket.com/albums/a221/screwthepap/Bersa_Thunder_380_Leftside_Small.jpg"><br><br>My intention was to make it my summer CCW sidearm, as the CZ 100 was proving to be a little difficult to conceal with light summer clothing. The Bersa is somewhat smaller and lighter than the CZ, and therefore a bit easier to conceal. For a short-barrelled pistol, it is <strong>surprisingly</strong> accurate and has been totally reliable thus far (over a thousand handloaded rounds fired thus far without a single jam).<br><br>Come winter, I'll go back to carrying the CZ 100 as the heavy winter clothing would be able to conceal it better.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Its kind of a weird move by the MAF as most countries are moving away from the M16 and its derivatives there they are now buying them now. I am not saying that the weapons are lousy but it doesn't make sense to dump a relatively new weapon (Steyr AUG used for only 15 years) to be replaced by a weapon of an older model. Further more other users of the Steyr AUG such as Australia are still using them without any problems. So what exactly is the root of the problem?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"></div>
