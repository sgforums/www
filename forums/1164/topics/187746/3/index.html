Safety is located infront of the trigger. Bullpups always take a longer time to reload compared to the conventional designed weapons.</div>

Of course, if the scope is damaged and the airtight seals compromised, air can leak back in and cause fogging.)</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>The iron sights on the SAR are good to 100 meters, i tried it at a life firing. Only issue is that they can't be zeroed, but it isn't a problem if you have a weapon that shoots reasonably straight.<br><br>Problem is they probably won't be that useful at night, unless something was done about it.<br><br>And the LAD is quite useful, if you use it in the right way. I seriously doubt anybody would leave it on and chiong with it, but it is fantastic for FIBUA where you can point-index a target far away, turn on your laser for a burst to get your aim right and squeeze off a shot without ever having to narrow your field of view to the sights... it can be a lifesaver in combat, reducing the attention needed to take aimed fire.<br><br>Problem is don't believe all the bull about it being factory zeroed, virtually every SAR after some time develops it's own quirks that requires normal zeroing. And the LAD needs to be zeroed as well, and to a certain range at that.<br><br>Don't have much issue with the trigger squeeze, except that it feels mushier then the M16... but I still could hit targets 300 meters away, and double taps aren't a problem. The M16 squeeze is nice to have, but not really necessary.<br><br>A real issue is the reload time, and I am wondering why they don't bother to give it a proper ease spring, given the fact that when you bang the weapon in open bolt hard enough, it would eash spring itself. Going for the charging handle is quite a hassle, and lowers considerably the loading time.<br><br>But all in all, I found the weapon a more reliable shoot then the M16, as much as the M16 reminds me more of a oil and metal gun. The SAR spits out metal that can kill, gives me things the M16 cannot provide, and that's good enough for me. I feel a lot of the compliants come from expecting M16 qualities from the SAR when it's a totally different weapon entirely requiring a different mindset. Going about the SAR with an M16 mindset means you never make full use of the weapon, and unless you make full use of it, how can you judge it fairly against the other?</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>26-04-2006: SME Ordnance in RM70m rifle deal<br>By Alfean Hardy<br><br>SME Ordnance Sdn Bhd has been given a letter of intent (LOI) by the Malaysian government for the supply of 14,000 Colt M4 Carbine assault rifles.<br><br>The contract, if finalised, would be worth about RM70 million and the rifles would be assembled under licence in Malaysia by the company.<br><br>The M4s will replace the armyÂ’s 15-year-old Steyr AUG rifles under provisions already made in the Ninth Malaysia plan (9MP). Eventually, the government is looking to buy more than 100,000 M4s, but in stages.<br><br>The LOI was among RM310.4 million worth of contracts and letters of acceptance (LOAs) signed at the Defence Services Asia 2006 exhibition in Subang on April 26.<br><br>The largest was the RM213.4 million contract signed between the government and SwitzerlandÂ’s Pilatus Aircraft Ltd for 10 PC-7 Mk II aircraft.<br><br>Other contracts include a five-year deal worth RM152 million between Satang Jaya Sdn Bhd and the government for safety and survival equipment, and a five-year contract between the government and Sapura Defence Sdn Bhd worth RM110.3 million for the maintenance of the air forceÂ’s simulator systems.<br><br>The RM310.4 million does not cover the four long-term contracts signed between the government and Satang Jaya, Zetro Aerospace and Sapura Defence.<br><br>so it is confirmed that they are gonna use the carbine! <img src="http://i21.photobucket.com/albums/b251/zetabranch/DSA06B/DSA229.jpg"></div>
