The US army will never go near a bullpup, whom they almost universally disdain.<br><br>Personally, putting aside the fact that it is a bullpup - I feel there are a lot of stupid things done on the SAR-21. Cannot fit bayonet. Cannot use M-16 mags. No iron sights. Unnecessary LAD. No rails on the standard weapon. Too heavy. If can fit GL as advertised, how come that version still not seen in SAF service? But as you'll notice, a bullpup can only fit a short barrel GL.<br><br>Anyway, the advantages of the M4 is that it has all the rails so that you can put stuff on it like a christmas trees, this not only has obvious tactical advantages but will also make the MAF look more modern. The AK series is still not made with rails, and it does look very dated.<br><br>The Steyr has no rails either, and because it is made under license they can't add modifications.<br><br>Someone mentioned that an army NEVER changes its infantry ammunition to another calibre. Something about logistics and careers etc...That's a pretty sweeping statement to make.<br><br>The whole western world cahnged from 7.62 NATO to 5.56 NATO 40 years ago. The European Combloc changed from 7.62x39 to 5.45 30 years ago.<br><br>China changed from 7.62x39 to 5.8mm in the 80's.<br><br>The massive Indonesian military uses all of the above including the 5.56, the 7.62x39 and possibly the 5.45.</div>

If you consider between the SAR21 and the M4, I will take the SAR21 anyday. Why?As it does not scarifice range and accuracy just so as to let the weapon maintain a smaller frame. Example, look at the Israelis, they saw the barrels of the CAR15s to make the weapon shorter, and end up having weapons which IA every few rounds. Besides, the SAR21 does have back-up iron sights if the scope fails, its on the top of the scope. I won't say that the LAD is totally useless, but in the case of KINS protection, it serves to intimidate would be threats into surrendering, as having a locked and loaded rifle with its laswer sight trained at your vitals is a really intimidating sight.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><strong>With the 7.62mm ammunition of the AK-47, one bullet is all it takes to stop a man dead in his tracks.<br><br>The more senior of Malaysian soldiers, whether retired or still in active service, are more inclined towards going back to the 7.62mm-calibre bullet.<br><br>It was this ammunition which was used before the armed forces changed to the M-16.<br><br>The weapon of choice then was the SLR, a tough and extremely accurate rifle which was possibly even more durable than the AK-47.</strong> </blockquote>im not sure how this is an entirely comparable factor. Granted the AK fires a 7.62 round, but thats vastly different from the 7.62 NATO round the FN FAL(SLR) fires. 1stly the cartridge is shorter, 39mm vs the 51mm of the NATO round. 2ndly the bullet head itself, and a whole host of ballistics factors, are different. In this case, how can they say "going back to the 7.62mm calibre bullet" because these are 2 entirely dfferent rounds?</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>This is very interesting. They are the first country to move back from a bullpup type rifle to a conventional straight line rifle. There must be lots of discussion on the internet, considering that the Steyr Augs are still new.<br><br>So while we are moving to the SAR21, Malaysia is going the opposite direction with the M4. Looks like they have also standardised on the newer 5.56mm rounds used by the SAWs.<br><br>Also, like Israel, and more recently the US - they have preferred a shorter rilfe in the form of a carbine as a standard. The Israeli army had used mostly older M16 carbines and are now moving to the Tavor.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hmm.......This is my personal take on how the SAR-21 should have been. Firstly, The LAD must be removed. Bcos the LAD has onli a combat range of abt 100m, thus watever beyond that is useless. In the night, the moment u on your LAD, u are a bullet magnet. All the ppls can see u and can shoot at you. You will be basically just a LIVING blinking figure 12. Next is the issue of the scope. The scope is prone to dewing in the morning and after river crossing, even wif scope rubber, it is damn JIALAT. They could have a rail instead for those sharpshooter to mount their scope. Lastly, should have a better iron-sight like that of M-16 to act as a spare.<br><br>I feel that the Singapore rifle should be USER friendly and also IDIOT-PROOF. Just tell me how the average left hander shoot with the SAR-21?<br>I think the emphasis should be more on fire-power than the part on accuracy. I remember that the jungle instructor at Laikun camp in Brunei told us that in typical jungle setting, the maximum typical engagement is lesser than 150m. Thus in the heat of a fire fight, do you think you will have the chance to aim properly and shoot? NO. History have also proven that fire-power is veri essential especially for conscript based army. Look at the battle of Stalingrad, the Soviet has at least 1 LMG, and 4 SMG per squad. Bcos in a typical BUA situation, you do not need to have range except for sniper. Also to train a typical conscript soldier to fire the Mosin Ngant properly is time consuming. Thus by letting their soldier carry the SMG, they will have a higher chance of killing the enemy eventhough they use more rounds. One might say that the average amt of time the Singaporean soldier receive for training is more than the Russians,....... but the veri old reservist guys may not be able to handle the new weapons that are too complicated. Thus having a cheap, pick up to fire type of rifle is definitely a plus over the typical new age rifle.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Perhaps I'm goignt o clarify a bit...... When I mean firepower, I do not mean just blindly switching to auto and spray. I mean we could do things like delivering a short burst. The SAR-21 trigger, seems a little bit hard to press down, and the auto selector is in a veri uncomfortable postion. I personally thing increasing the amount of fire power per section is a safer option to ensure the destruction of the enemy, rather than to take aim. For example the German army of WW2 has at least 3 men carrying the panzerfaust per squad. Compared to the British which prefer to concentrate their anti-armour efforts to onli a team of PIAT. Yes, u can train the PIAT team to be peace time "marksman for anti tank" but could you ensure they will produce the same results under combat fatigue and stress? For the German army case, they can still take on the enemy armour even if the guy miss, but for the British wat will happen if they miss.......will they be able to reload in time? Furthermore the panzerfaust is cheaper and a veri idiot proof weapon</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by equlus84:</div><div class="quote_body">Perhaps I'm goignt o clarify a bit...... When I mean firepower, I do not mean just blindly switching to auto and spray. I mean we could do things like delivering a short burst. The SAR-21 trigger, seems a little bit hard to press down, and the auto selector is in a veri uncomfortable postion. I personally thing increasing the amount of fire power per section is a safer option to ensure the destruction of the enemy, rather than to take aim. For example the German army of WW2 has at least 3 men carrying the panzerfaust per squad. Compared to the British which prefer to concentrate their anti-armour efforts to onli a team of PIAT. Yes, u can train the PIAT team to be peace time "marksman for anti tank" but could you ensure they will produce the same results under combat fatigue and stress? For the German army case, they can still take on the enemy armour even if the guy miss, but for the British wat will happen if they miss.......will they be able to reload in time? Furthermore the panzerfaust is cheaper and a veri idiot proof weapon</div></blockquote>The PIAT is very different from the Panzerfaust. It's closer to the Panzercheck. The former being much like a LAW and the latter today's ATGM. Even if both were unguided. The PIAT and Panzercheck were heavier reload able weapons usually used in teams while the Panzerfaust was a 1 time use squad lvl AT weap.<br><br>Anyway having a harder to squeeze trigger doesnt affect firepower as much as it affects responds time.....<br><br>Back on topic. Yea it does seem like a step back. I mean the M4 is based on an aging design and i believe the US is aready waiting to replace it....Though with the XM8 canned i'm not sure if they will replace it.<br>i guess like someone said, they rushed it for their Defence exhibition.Possibly some political thing again.....sucks for them</div>
