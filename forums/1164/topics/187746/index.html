            <div class='col-md body'>This is an article taken from a malaysian military forum. So far this is still not confirmed yet.<br><br>KUALA LUMPUR: The Malaysian armed forces? 15-year association with Steyr AUG A1 assault rifles could be coming to an end soon.<br><br>Sources said the replacement for the Austrian-designed rifles will be announced at the biennial Defence Services Asia exhibition, which begins tomorrow at the Asia-Pacific Auction Centre in Subang.<br><br>The replacement rifle is a tightly-kept secret.<br><br>While several candidates for replacing the AUG A1 were considered, it is learnt that the choice was believed to have been decided based on a transfer of technology which will allow a local company to produce the weapon in Malaysia.<br><br>Two possibilities remain for this ? that the local company produces the rifle under licence or that it sets up a joint venture company with the foreign manufacturer.<br><br>One of the possible replacements for the Steyr is the latest-generation M-16A4 assault rifle from America.<br><br>The Steyr had replaced the earlier version of the Colt rifle, the M-16A1, first used by US servicemen during the Vietnam War.<br><br>The benefit of using the M-16A4 weapon is that the Malaysian armed forces still owns and operates the older versions of the M-16, although this is mainly for training and ceremonial purposes and for the Territorial Army.<br><br>Other assault rifles in the running include the famed Kalashnikov AK-47, the highly-durable assault rifle which is even older than the M-16, having been designed just after World War II.<br><br>The Russian-made rifle has proven its calibre with its worldwide use and with fewer working parts, the weapon was less likely to jam and is likely to be much cheaper than the American weapon.<br><br>Another plus point is that the weapon fires a larger calibre bullet, making it more lethal.<br><br>Complaints among US soldiers when the M-16 was used in the Vietnam War was that a charging enemy soldier would sometimes take three bullets and still continue running.<br><br>With the 7.62mm ammunition of the AK-47, one bullet is all it takes to stop a man dead in his tracks.<br><br>The more senior of Malaysian soldiers, whether retired or still in active service, are more inclined towards going back to the 7.62mm-calibre bullet.<br><br>It was this ammunition which was used before the armed forces changed to the M-16.<br><br>The weapon of choice then was the SLR, a tough and extremely accurate rifle which was possibly even more durable than the AK-47.<br><br>The fact that the M-16 can be fitted with the M203 grenade launcher, may decide in its favour.<br><br>Another possibility is the United Kingdom-made L85A2, currently in use by British forces.<br><br>The weapon, which saw action in the Gulf War and Operation Iraqi Freedom, utilises the bullpup design (with pistol grip located forward of the magazine) similar to the Steyr.<br><br>This gives the weapon a plus factor as our soldiers would be familiar with its design.<br><br>Another plus factor is that the rifle fires standard Nato rounds of 5.56mm calibre.<br><br>A distant possibility is the Famas (Fusil d?ssaut de la Manufacture d?rmes de St-Etienne) assault rifle.<br><br>The Famas is currently the French military weapon of choice and also utilises Nato standard rounds in a bullpup design.<br><br><a href="http://forum.cari.com.my/viewthread.php?tid=209852&amp;extra=page%3D1&amp;page=1" rel="nofollow">http://forum.cari.com.my/viewthread.php?tid=209852&amp;extra=page%3D1&amp;page=1</a><br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I heard about this from various sources over the past year. There seems to be a few different opinions about this - from poor production quality, Steyr pulling out of Malaysia, to being able to produce their own rifles.<br>Whatever it is, its a major exercise, considering that the Steyr AUGs are introduced not too long ago.<br><br>Best to wait and see.

I continue to see M-16/M203 being used among SAR21-equipped units. Does anyone know if we are using SAR-21 with GL?<br><br>It seems manufacturing the Steyr AUG is rather demanding. The Australians also have quite a few issues with their own locally-made Steyr AUGs.<br><br>The option of selecting the AK-47 is actually a very sound choice, in my opinion. Since Malaysia is mostly jungle, most of the time you can see what you are shooting at anyway, so accuracy may not be such a top priority. If so, then the AK-47 makes perfect sense. The bullet can punch through foilage better and is definitely more of a man-stopper compared to the 5.56mm or the Russian's newer 5.45mm.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Although the M4 is a battle proven weapon as shown in the recent conflicts in Iraq and Afganistan, it is still primarily based on the AR-15 which is first used in the Vietnam War, 40 years ago. So in a way they are like taking a step backwards. I wonder why they want to replace the Steyr Aug after only 15 years.<br><br>I think the newer variants of the AK which fires 7.62 rounds will be suitable. This is because, the round is heavy enough to be able to go through tree trunks unlike 5.56. Its very tough and reliable and can withstand the rugged terrain and humid climate in Malaysia. Lower maintenace as compared to the M16. Its very cheap as well. This is based on the fact that Malaysia is still heavily forested<br><br>However, as the nation develops, urban terrain will one day take over. The shorter length of the M4 will be an advantage. The AK with the large curved magazine will make firing in prone position difficult.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><br>M4?? even though battle proven, have very low stopping power. Lotsa US troops complaining about that, but its a good rifle   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br><br>I think they meant M16A4?<br><br>But Ak-47? Gosh, if they opt for it they will be moving backwards. AK-100+ series would be a better choice since it fires a 5.56mm</div>

They're not that serious, aren't they?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_eek.gif" alt="Shocked" title="Shocked"><br><br>While I agree that it's a good and proven weapon for FIBUA ops, it's certainly not a weapon you want for standard jungle warfare. It's certainly lighter and shorter than the good old M16, but it also means that you get less range and accuracy.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Seriously, the effective range of the M4, is more than adequate for jungle warfare.  Dense vegetation won't allow u to see more than 50 meters if u are lucky.  And terrain more than often wont let u see more than 200 meters in a certain direction, esp with regards to plantations.<br><br>M4 is not too bad too, since it allows for specialised attachments.  However, it still suffer from the same problem as the M-16 no? The dirty gases fouling up the chamber resulting in more jams.<br><br>Why didn they consider the HK G36C if they want a carbine option?</div>
