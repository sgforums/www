The armbrust LAW is designed to penetrate armour so the warhead is not explosive. Further more it is high velocity so it will fly straight without any curve, if it is aim up then the projectile should land in an downward curve instead of an upward one.<br><br>Anyway it is fortunate that the projectile did not hit anyone in the exhibition hall or many more will be killed as it can penetrate many bodies before hitting something tough enough to stop it.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"></div>
