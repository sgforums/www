            <div class='col-md body'>The SAF uses the Ultimax series as SAW in an infantry section. The US uses the FN Minimi M249. I read from a wedsite: (http://www.phoenixcommand.com/Ultimax100.htm)  which states that our SAW is a contender together with the Minimi for US Army's SAW contest ,however the Minimi is chosen before the Ultimax can be perfected. My question is how is our latest model of Ultimax compared with the current Minimi which the US is using? If theirs is superior then will we be changing any time soon? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"></div>

The damn mag can only be machine loaded for it to be full ,you try loading it manually and it can nvr go beyond 40 plus rounds.So to say that current SAW really has 100 rounds capability is a slight misnomal as you will not have ready logistic support whenever u need to reload the thing,ending up u will still be stuck most of the time in using the 30 rounds mag.<br><br>Well this is my personal experience as well as all the people i know who handle SAW b4.If any of you guys really have experience loading a full 100 rounds into the drum manually then i have nothing to say.</div>

They are more likely to be use in very defensive position or fire support. Then the case of belt magzine is advantage ! In prolong engagement, you can clip on a new belt when the existing is running short. You cannot do that for Ultimax 100, in fact what the logic of someone having to carry a extra tools just to load a 100 rds mag ? think they rather carry an extra belt of ammo.<br><br></div>

They are more likely to be use in very defensive position or fire support. Then the case of belt magzine is advantage ! In prolong engagement, you can clip on a new belt when the existing is running short.

            <div class='col-md body'>The fact that the Ultimax drum cannot be re-loaded in the field was often used to attack the Ultimax. But this is unfair. Running out of pre-loaded drum magazines means you have a ammo and logistic supply problem situation. It's not a problem with the drums not being reloadable. Cos belts are not reloadable either. If you have a ammo supply problem situation with a belt-fed SAW, you'd be no better off cos then you'd be out of belts.<br><br>What did it for me was the fact that you still have to carry the bulky empty drums after using them.<br><br>The Russians used pan magazine SAW called the RPD (I think) in WW2.<br><br>Then they swiched to belt-fed SAWs in the 50's, 60's and 70's.<br><br>Then they switched to using an "up-gunned" AK-47 called the RPK with a silly 40-round curved box magazine.<br><br>Don't know what they are using now.<br><br>The Chinese, on the other hand, have developed a Minimi-type LMG in their unique 5.8mm calibre. But at the same time, their current new service weapon the 5.8mm QBZ-97 bullpup also has a SAW version.<br><br>So I am curious as to what roles they have assigned to each weapon.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>The plus points of SAW are light and very little recoil..  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>The minus points are it seemed to be made of cheaply produced 'stamp' metal and the parts dun slide very well and prone to rust.<br><br>Under range conditions there's no problem, but does anyone have any comments after using it in field condition?<br><br>Well, during BCTC, I dragged it through sand and mudwater and after that, the thing can't even fire! Generally, getting the SAW to fire smoothly in the field seems to be a tricky business of playing around with the gas regulator and keeping the weapon very clean... Unfortunately, there were a few times when the weapon failed me during crucial moments...  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_sad.gif" alt="Sad" title="Sad"><br><br>Personally, if firepower (ie. a lot of noise) is required of me, I'll carry the trusty GPMG with a box of ammo... seems to be the best MG in the world today... even the US has discarded the M60 in favour of it... though no one in the world seems to be using the SAW except us...  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_confused.gif" alt="Confused" title="Confused"><br><br></div>
