Which is more important military technology or having a solid soldier using outdated weapons? Let me give you this scenario. Country A and Country B are identical in terms of national wealth, population and other issues. Both have a equal amount of defence budget. The difference is that Country A uses that defense budget to buy and develop highly capable and modern weapons. So we're talking top of the line equipment like modern MBTs,MLRS, air superiority fighters,IFVs etc etc. Country B on the other hand uses it defense budget on training its manpower. As a result, Country B's soldiers are better trained, more garang and tough, its general staff is more effective and its doctrine is more defined. Given that  all other factors are equal, if Country A and B were to go to war, who would win?</div>

To address Darkness_hacker99's point, the Black Hawk had Black Hole IR suppression for its exhaust and a heap of electronic defences, but ultimately it was brought down by a primitive unguided weapon that was fired by someone who knew how to use it.<br><br>Tripwire's point was that we've got all of these wonderful toys that can do amazing things.  Sure it can, but the historical facts bear out that what happens on the business end of all of any weapon, be it a high-tech doohickie or a Boer War rifle, is still determined by the user at the other end.  Technology, useful as it is, still does not eliminate the need for competence in the human part of the equation.<br><br>Tripwire says that satellites can see all the way to the North Pole.  Well and good.  Did satellites find Saddam, or was humint the key?  Have satellites been able to locate Osama?<br><br>Alex makes a good point of highlighting Vietnam and Iraq.  The fact is that the American military structure is geared for a Gulf War 1 style fight.  When it becomes asymmetrical warfare, which is pretty much all we've been seeing lately, it is, and I quote the Chinese colonel who commented on 9/11, "trying to hit a mosquito with a hammer".<br><br>Why did the Americans lose Vietnam and why has Bush admitted that they are struggling in Iraq?  The American definition of a win requires that front lines be crossed for victory to be achieved.  By definition, guerrilla warfare exists without front lines, so there can never be a win for the Yanks.  You can use Apaches to wipe out the enemy's tank divisions, but what can you do if there is no tank division to destroy, and instead you have a dispersed and hidden enemy on your hands?  You're just punching water.<br><br>The bottom line is that it's not a matter of how whiz-bang your toys are, but how well suited they are to the job.  If it was just a matter of technology, Iraq would have been done and dusted ages ago and the US population would be 3000 members richer.</div>
