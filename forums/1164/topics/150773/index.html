            <div class='col-md body'>I think it is time for us to seriously consider getting long ranged anti-missile systems like the Russian S-300PMU-2. We have lost this capability since we have retired the Bloodhound missiles years ago. Another possibility,though more remote is the production of a surface to surface missile of similar range by ourselves to counter attack when we are hit. This is not so possible at the moment since we lack the technical know-how and we having good relations with the fellow members in ASEAN.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote>The missiles would be placed on <strong>several Indonesian islands </strong>to create some credible defence," he said, adding that the sprawling archipelago is also looking at India as a possible source of military supplies</blockquote>.<br><br>I think it is unlikely to be an anti-ship missile since it is to be land based.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"><br><br><blockquote>'We are planning for about <strong>10 to 15 missiles</strong>" with a range of 150 to 200 kilometres, the defence chief said.</blockquote>Furthermore with 10 to 15 anti-ship missiles it is hardly enough to protect Indonesia. Therefore, it is more likely that these are surface to surface missiles so as to act as a deterrence to the more technologically and sophisticated armed forces such as Australia around Indonesia.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"></div>
