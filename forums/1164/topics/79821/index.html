            <div class='col-md body'>Well, some clerks are not clerks by vocation per se.These people face more stress as they know that being a clerk is just an appointment which is not guaranteed due to estab, and can be pulled out of that branch due to whim and fancy of higher-ups.I would say that armament specs who are holding clerk appointments have it really bad.<br>On one hand, they are qualified to maintain and repair weapon systems, on the other, they are required to do reports and admin work which is very stressful because they are dealing with multi-million dollar systems,and technical reports are bad for one's sanity, because maintenance and equipment status reports eventually find their way up to SSSOs, which makes even the lower-level clerks sweat because they simply can't afford any inaccuracy in the data.not to say mistakes are good, but these people are under serious pressure to be perfect and they are small in number due to estab(again!), or medical reasons prohibiting them from working in the workshop. Anyone has the same experience here?Care to add? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mad.gif" alt="Mad" title="Mad"></div>
