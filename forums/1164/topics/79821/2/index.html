I looked at the NS guy posted there, asked him what does he do when there are no NCC cadets to train, he said he and his PC seldom books into camp! Btw, NCC training is only a few times in a year!

            <div class='col-md body'>Hello brother Johnston,<br><br>Yup I was in ARTC way back when it was planted in the god forsaken AngMo Quee Camp.  I kana Head Log office in 1990 and left in 1991.  What about you?  Are you the same batch as me.<br><br>Yah lah ... there's a majority of clerks and lobos who has it easy throughout their whole life.  And I really admire the direct intakes too (i.e. join NS wearing CV clothing in AMQ camp from 1st day as clerk)<br>I remember I even had 2 assistants to help me.  1 was a confess case and the other was a freko case where from driver (he failed his driver course some more) he got posted to store man (and the QM hated him) and then got posted to my office.  Yah lah ... those 2, can delegate lah ... but you'll worry more after that.  So end up me doing 80% of the work still, and the other 2 taking turns going to the photo copier zapping things and stapling and doing simple despatch for me.  Those 2 had it easy ... but not me.<br><br>From an office clerk, I even from time to time kana exercise controller because my officers had to go field training.  Sigh ... really like waiter in field and had to camp in field some more ... really feel short changed.<br><br>But I made a few close friends who are still in contact with me until now.  I can still foundly remember:<br>- 10am - 10.30am Canteen to eat Kong Guan Char Siew Pau and watch people play arcade machines.  I really have to hand it to those that can play a game with just 20cents from start to finish<br>-  12noon - 1pm Siesta.  Never go cook house (rememner the 10am snack) and tuang to auditorium (I was in charge of the room and had the key), turn on the air con and koon<br>these are the only 2 major activities that our 'gang' must do every day ... kind of miss it.</div>
