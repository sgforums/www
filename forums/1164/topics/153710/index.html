            <div class='col-md body'>its also good that the troops restrained from firing on the iraqi's.<br><br>it could so easily have gone the other way with the units defending themselves rather than just getting out of the way &gt; resulting heavy casualties on the iraqi side and victory for the millitia/insurgents in the media.<br><br>i believe that after the photos and video were taken, the troops got back in and drove the vehicle out of harms way.<br><br>somewhat restrained, i think, if compared to the americans in a similar situation..<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Ya, i agree. The troops showed incredible restraint. I can only imagine how much the tankies would have wanted to just run the petrol-bomb thrwing rent-a-mob.<br><br>What is really worrying though, is how corrupt the Basrah Police really is. The troops were ordered to break into the police station when the commander was told that the 2 SAS soldiers have been handed over to the local militia!<br><br>They were found in a house about 300m away from the police station! Damn Iraqis.</div>
