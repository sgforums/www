It really depends what between how one interprets the world destroyed and damaged. If the tank was truely destoryed like in the case of the marine Amphibious troop carrier which was blown to bits by RPG, it is impossible that the crew could have not suffered injuries. On the other hand, with the report that the tank crew were not injured. This probably means that the tank was probably damaged and could go back in to action in a short time.</div>

Seperated fireproof and armored turret bustles and blow out panels vent the explosions upwards and out away from the turret. Crew can actually survive quite within the turret while ammo is brewing up, though evacuation during such an event would be problematic as the ammo would mean the deck of the tank is unsafe. Abrams had brewed up several times (in bout 9 friendly fire incidents) in the gulf war after taking friendly GAU-8 and Manverick missiles to the rear, but not in one case was a crew member harmed and in many cases the tank returned to action a few hours later after repairs.<br><br>Several other cases had M1A1s trying to destroy bogged down M1A1s stuck in the mud during 1991 with their 120mm guns, attempts to demolish M1A1s always failed and the tanks had to be towed out later when they were examined, to their surprise, to be still functional though the turrets of course, had to be replaced.<br><br>The .50cal rounds were cooking off OUTSIDE the turret, that's where they are stored and why some crew could not get outside their tank because they stood a chance of getting hit from a stray. If they cooked off inside, the crew would be dead.<br><br>The fuel tank of the tank are armored and self sealing, and the turbine powerpack (which is pretty small with the transmittion taking up most of the space) has fire control features built into it. A hit to the powerpack will work to disable the tank, but not set it on fire.<br><br>Unless the Iraqis dropped a 2,000 pound bomb or sent a 155mm through the roof of the M1A1, they would have a lot of problems trying to make sure they are truly destroyed and will not return in a later action.<br><br>From what it seems, the Iraqis managed to backstab the Abrams either by ATGMs or anti tank guns to the rear, which is not armored with the chobhamm DU armor, such a hit, either to the ammo bustle or the powerpack would have disabled an Abrams or set it on fire, but hardly caused fatal damage that made it non recoverable.<br><br>Reminds me of world war two, when some shermans were "destroyed" in action about <span style="font-style: italic;">four</span> times because each time the allies managed to salvage it and bring it back to action.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Most of your points show your lack of ability to actually comprehend statements before you respond. You appear to be going via your own negative imagination rather then take case studies off things that have happened before. Case in point, most of your arguments go by "can you imagine" or "can you see" type of lines, which are pretty much invalidated esp. when you have demostrated that you know little more about Abrams taking battle damage outside this article.<br><br>If you want to know about the real world, I suggest that you actually go read about real world events that have happened and have been recorded before.<br><br>What does the real world show? That Abrams had been brewed up and returned to active duty before.<br><br>All you read in the article was the "word" destroyed, which as I am trying to point out, can have many multiple meanings for a tank such an the Abrams, which are probably nowhere near as negative as you would like to think.<br><br>Of course, the article did not mention anything more then just two Abrams being "destroyed" by enemy fire, which as I have pointed out, highly ambigious given the many damage control measures put in the Abrams and the fact that history has demostrated before that such incidents hardly mean that the tank is destroyed as par said.<br><br>As for how long it takes to return the tank to active duty, two points. First it already proves that the better term to use for that incident was "damaged" and invalidates your rabid arguments. Secondly most of the Abrams which suffered friendly fire incidents (in which the tanks suffered all the symptoms you stated that said they should be destroyed) were back out in the field within 48 hours during the gulf war.<br><br>Nuff said.</div>

From the front and sides, the M1A1 series of tanks sport DU enhanced chobhamm armor that provides very effective protection against kenetic and chemical attacks. The Abrams is effectively invulnerable to most anti-armor threats from the front, and to a lesser extent, the sides.<br><br>In fact, it has long been a proven fact (one which  I need not explain here if you bothered to read up on the subject before blowing your own head off in here) is that there have been multiple instances where M1A1s have being hit by their own 120mm and Iraqi 125mm guns, along with RPGs and even ATGMs. They all failed to penetrate. If this was a lie by spin doctors, it must be one that takes all kinds of conspiracy larger then the X-files to create.<br><br>However, one thing that anybody worth his salt in armor (unfortunately not you) would know is that the M1A1 does not have this protection on it's rear sides. And that makes the Abrams vulnerable to threats that hit it from the rear. So while the anti-tank gun on the truck would have bounced off the Abrams like shots from pea-shooters from the front and sides, it would be perfectly capable of penetrating where the Abrams does not sport it's composite armor suite. As would other AT weapons.<br><br><blockquote><br>Army Time is an <strong>AMERICAN MILITARY NEWSPAPER, </strong>if they say that 2 of their American Abram tanks were destroyed in battle.<br><br>Who are we to say otherwise !!!<br></blockquote>That's a matter of journalism. Anyway, if you have read "American Military Newspapers" as much as I did, you know that some of them hardly know what they are talking about, and if you argue this point, you only prove it. But that asides. What I am trying to say otherwise, is that the term "destroyed" in this case is extremely ambigious, but based on what I know the Abrams is capable of, not anywhere near as negative as you would like to think it.<br><br><blockquote><br><strong>What You Read Is DEAD , the Real World Is ALIVE.</strong><br></blockquote>If that is true, how come you are basing your case on what you <span style="font-style: italic;"><span style="color: red;"><span class="large"><strong>read </strong></span></span></span>off an article, and one which described events in such an vague and ambigious nature as well?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green">  ooh blew your own foot off...<br><br>Nuff said...<br><br>[/b][/quote]</div>
