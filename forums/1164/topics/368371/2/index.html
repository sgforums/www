              <p><br>I have three reasons. 1. A serial killer/rapist only has 700km2 of space to hide in Singapore. Canada is about 14,000 times larger. 2. You can actually run non stop from one end of Singapore to the other. In Canada you'd be running straight to hell if you tried. 3. In Singapore you wont be randomly killed and eaten by a wild bear while on a cycling/hiking trip at bukit timah nature reserve.</p>

              <p>trying to compare two countries is like comparing two persons by their biodata. In the end, what is good for you may not be good for others.</p>
              <p>I lived in Canada, in Toronto, Calgary, London and Vancouver for a few months. I'd say I prefer Singapore.</p>
              <p>there are many things that are good in Canada, cospomolitan society in Toronto, beautiful rockie in Calgary, warm and nice people in London, and beautiful weather in Vancouver, most part of the year.</p>
              <p>There are also many things that I would rather not have to endure, in toronto, winter cold like shit and in summer warm like..., in Calgary, you stay at home in winter learning how to hack the internet, and you dont have the kind of food you can get in Singapore, in London you are practically 'out of this world', not in heaven but somewhere in the universe, you don't know what happends outside, in Vancouver I may as well move to HK.</p>
              <p>I can tell you there are many things in Singapore that you dont have in Canada. and one of this is a PAP government!!! believe me or not but it is true that many people in canada, especially the caucasian, are nuts over how a government can do wonders to a small place, "imagine if our government is half as efficient, with Canada's vast resources, we don't have to be mistaken as American".</p>
              <p>äººæ¯”äººï¼Œæ°”æ­»äººã€‚how to company countres? one is a continent, the other one is a city state. go to toronto you are exactly opposite singapore on the other side of the globe, there must be some difference, good and not so good.</p>
              <p>I enjoy what I have.</p>

              <p><br>Duh... All training schedules are not allowed to be divulged to the public. The maximum we can divulged is our PT testing schedule because it very visible to public and located only in certain areas. If you want, please get your unit commander to contact MINDEF, our ministry of defence.If I remember rightly, our light training is from 1 day to 2 weeks and our heavy training can last from 4 days to several months.</p>

              <p>there are many things that are good in Canada, cospomolitan society in Toronto, beautiful rockie in Calgary, warm and nice people in London, and beautiful weather in Vancouver, most part of the year.</p>
              <p>There are also many things that I would rather not have to endure, in toronto, winter cold like shit and in summer warm like..., in Calgary, you stay at home in winter learning how to hack the internet, and you dont have the kind of food you can get in Singapore, in London you are practically 'out of this world', not in heaven but somewhere in the universe, you don't know what happends outside, in Vancouver I may as well move to HK.</p>
              <p>I can tell you there are many things in Singapore that you dont have in Canada. and one of this is a PAP government!!! believe me or not but it is true that many people in canada, especially the caucasian, are nuts over how a government can do wonders to a small place, "imagine if our government is half as efficient, with Canada's vast resources, we don't have to be mistaken as American".</p>

              <p>LENGGONG, May 29 (Bernama) -- The call for former Malayan Communist
                  Party (MCP) Secretary-General Chin Peng to be allowed to return to
                  Malaysia has evoked painful nostalgia for residents of a remote village
                  in Hulu Perak, which had once been a target of the communist aggression.<br> <br> The government's decision as announced by Prime Minister Datuk
                  Seri Najib Tun Razak to not allow<span style="color: #ff0000;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong> Chin Peng, who is currently living in
                  exile in Hatyai, </strong></span></span>Thailand to return to Malaysia, even on humanitarian
                  grounds, was received well by villagers as well as an individual who
                  claimed to be a former MCP leader.<br> <br> A former MCP unit assistant chief in Kampung Belum, Mohamad Wan
                  Kechik, 84, said Chin Peng should not be allowed to return because of
                  the atrocities the guerilla movement inflicted on the people.<br> <br> "Although I was a member of the MCP in the past, I still don't
                  agree on Chin Peng's return because he had caused much hardship to
                  villagers here.<br> <br> "It's not that I want to praise him, but he is good to those who
                  listen to him but can be really mean to those who don't," he told
                  reporters when met at Kampung Belum Baru here.<br> <br> The British placed more than 150 families from Kampung Belum into Kampung Belum Baru to curb communist aggression.<br> <br> Mohamad said although the MCP had officially laid down arms 20
                  years ago in 1989, it isn't easy for those who went through the ordeal
                  to forget it.<br> <br> His friend, Isa Awang Ngah, 82, said the communists controlled the
                  Belum area for three years from 1948 to 1951, and villagers were
                  tortured for not cooperating.<br> <br> He said villagers had to surrender any type of food such as rice, padi and corn to the communists to avoid being tortured.<br> <br> "The communists were really nice at first, but they were actually
                  mean and could not be trusted. If they give ten sen they will ask back
                  for a ringgit," he said.<br> <br> "I do not agree with anyone who would want to bring back Chin Peng
                  and I am not willing to face the communists again. Because of them I
                  had to leave the village," he said.<br> <br> Another villager, Sidek Ishak, 71, recounted his unforgettable
                  experience in which he saw a public execution in front of his eyes.<br> <br> "If the communists want to kill someone, they will invite the
                  villagers to come and enjoy a feast of meat . After the meal they will
                  conduct the execution in public to instil fear among the villagers," he
                  said.<br> <br> The Prime Minister on Wednesday announced that Ching Peng would
                  not be allowed to return to Malaysia because it would cause unhappiness
                  among the families of victims who were killed by the MCP.</p>
