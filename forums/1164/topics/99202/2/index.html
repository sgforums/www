            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote>ask you guys a question, do u guys HONESTLY BELIEVE the crap that our soldiers can fight to win a war? </blockquote>Why not? I'm part of the 2G Army, but never pretended that we were some type of Rambo or elite status. Sure, we're reservist but how many citizen armies around the world train for as long as we do?<br><br>It's not like a real war won't be a mad dash for glory either. Each of us will face the gauntlet personally, but until then all the preparatory training - weapon proficiency, group efficiency, team bonding, problem solving - cannot but put us in good stead. Poor fitness wasn't what caused the Commonwealth forces to run all the way downcountry against the Jap onslaught.<br><br>Besides, having gone through the whole ICT cycle, I could circumscribe out a timespan - generally between your 2nd high-key to your 10th year or so - where 1stly, unit morale is quite high &amp; 2ndly, the citizen soldiers' collective maturity more than offsets the by-the-textbook ways of the younger conscripts. Yes, the IPPT scores may differ, but I dare bet the scores for the other combat quality-control tests (eg. ATEC or FATEP that assesses tactics, coordination &amp; competence) are just as good, if not higher, for the reservists. Operational-ready isn't just a buzzword, you know.<br><br>The newly-revised reservist cycle - 3 BIT stints to close out 7 high-key ICTs - would suggest MINDEF took our feedback seriously.<br><br><blockquote>is anyone so naive as to think that all countries allow uarmed forces to land on their lands and procede to blast say. oh their fields and roads as war explode around them?! NO! </blockquote>No doubt S'pore's strategic thinking consists primarily of possible war scenarios against our immediate neighbors - but do think this through more.<br><br>Yes, the option of invading Malaysian hinterland has always been around, in order to forestall anyone imitating the Japs. But Malaysia still can't get its house in order; the '60s-70s communist insurgency, the more-recent Islamic fundamentalism, &amp; the periodic belligerence of communalist politics constantly threatened their internal security. The counterinsurgency needs still presents stem their ambitions to upgrade to a conventional force. We're wary of those developments more than the Mahathir government's saber-rattling.<br><br>The Indonesian archipelago doesn't offer a security threat, partly due to its multifaceted size &amp; also the long LKY-Suharto friendship. That is, unless it decides to build nuclear plants for economic benefits or something. The ongoing irritants - esp. piracy, the haze &amp; an extradiction treaty - are manageable, while any possibility of civil strife (with accompanying Chinese exodus to these shores) currently "subdued" by the JI terrorist menace.<br><br>Despite the regional rivalries, there's also more indirect territorial cooperation that you think - particularly guarding against the Vietnam Communists (until the '90s). Huxley mentioned the CDOs were sent to train near the Thai border in the '70s partly to learn the ground, while in the next decade we also supposedly considered helping Malaysia to defend against any Viet aggression.</div>

Not comparing the full time national service but come to reservist training, SAF is very series. Doubt that they really know what type of reservist training in others.<br><br>Taiwan reservist training is almost none at all, other rank only 1 day reporting, officer is 3 days doctrine &amp; weapons update, does it call training?<br>Lucky or unlucky that during the reservist training in infantry &amp; arty unit, the 'Mexican' was involved &amp; they commend on our reservist training standard &amp; demand, for them is preparing &amp; ready for war. Do not forget, reservist is main core of fighting troop not the so call un-operational NSF.<br><br>Tim Huxley did mention correct that our army is not tested &amp; have war experience.

            <div class='col-md body'>actually, i am currently serving my national service... i'm on a 10-day leave but most of my friends are busy studying for exams, so i spend most of my day sleeping and watching crap on tv (i haven't watched tv for over a year now, come to think of it).<br><br>ok, first what exactly do we mean by "abuse"? corporal punishment, i.e. slapping, kicking, punching soldiers?? or hazing, i.e. forcing new privates to undergo an "initiation process" (which may or may not include corporal punishment)???<br><br>well to answer your question, <span style="font-style: italic;">officially</span> corporal punishment and hazing is illegal in the korean military... unofficially though, hehe...hazing is still thiriving, and corporal punishment, though not as bad as it used to be, is still around... though the severity of both really differs from unit to unit. some units are very brutal, while others are reputed to be quite slack.<br><br>basically, it's an old tradition in our military, passed down from senior enlisted to junior. eventually, in time, the "juniors" become the "seniors".... and the process repeats itself.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_confused.gif" alt="Confused" title="Confused"><br><br>i won't go into too many details on a public forum, though i will say that the first few weeks after i arrived at my unit were the worst in my life. compared to the hazing i received at my unit, basic training was a breeze. i was pushed to the limits of my mental and physical endurance... each night when i was finally allowed to go to bed i wanted to cry because the hazing was so severe. i actually became sick with fever and vomitting, but some seniors thought i was malingering, so they kept on punishing me until i "realised" that no, actually, i <span style="font-style: italic;">wasn't</span> sick!!! <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br><br>these days, i still shudder when i think of the hazing i went through as a private. (if u really wanna know the details i can pm you, i guess.)<br><br>right now, i'm a corporal in the army. for the record, i have never been hit, although when i was in basic training i was often handled physically, like being shoved to the ground, lifted by the collar and thrown, and choked (once! <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_sad.gif" alt="Sad" title="Sad">  ) by my drill sergeant. but i escaped the worst because i was quiet and kept my head down.<br><br>personally, i don't approve of corporal punishment - nothing too severe at least. it's risky - no one ever died from doing too many pushups, flutterkicks, sleep deprivement, threats, etc. - but someone can be seriously injured if beaten up... i know this one guy who was beaten on an almost daily basis when he was a private - he eventually landed in hospital! (he recovered and left in one piece - no permanent damage, lucky for him.)<br><br>if one <span style="font-style: italic;">really</span> needs to use the @sshole approach, i've observed that just swearing and threating to beat the shit out of an unmotivated soldier while waving an entrenching tool usually works well enough! <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"> either that, or make him go into a modified pushup position, except that his head is on the ground and his hands behind his back... he'll be crying for mercy in no time!!<br><br>hmmm, so did the hazing toughen me? i think it did, but mostly mentally. physically, i was actually <span style="font-style: italic;">worse</span> than before - the constant fear, stress, and punishments took a toll on my health; i became very sick (and when i reported that i was feeling "ill", my seniors responded by doubling the intensity of the hazing!!!) but one thing i learned: the human body (and mind) is more resilient than we think... and what doesn't kill you, really <strong><span style="font-style: italic;">does</span></strong> make you stronger! (it's a quote from Nietzche, btw)<br><br>NOTE: the "barraks room" hazing i described here is to be understood as different from the <span style="font-style: italic;">training</span>, which is a completely different animal. i'm not from combat arms so i can't speak with any authority on their training, though from what i hear and observe it really, <span style="font-style: italic;">really</span> sucks to be infantry. i work as an interpreter for a bunch of occifers, so i don't really have any "field training" to speak of besides basic training and the occasional roadmarch, NBC training, basic skills training, range, etc...<br><br>the korean army is already hell to begin with....!!!!!! confined to base for 2 years (there are no "weekend pass", only a few "leaves" per soldier for duration of the 2 years), sh!tty living conditions, even more sh!tty pay (we get allowance of maybe SG$20-40 a month depending on rank), and a very brutal, if neccessary, hazing system.<br><br>i had a friend who volunteeered for Marine Corps infantry; i thought he was insane, though i admired his spunk at the same time. if i was an american, maybe i'd volunteer for combat arms in u.s. military, but not in the korean army.... but that's just me  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>one thing i've noticed is that abuse seems to depend largely on the instructors themselves. Personally i was never abused during BMT, and my BMT Plt Sgt was someone who knew how to motivate ppl very well. He was fierce when needed, granted, and he often threatened to throw his boots at us, but darned if we actually thought he would undo his boots just to take them off n throw at us. He was also my sec comd because we had a shortage of sgts, and when we broke down to sections for training, he was the one who motivated us very well. my section often got our training done right the st time 'round because he was that good. ultimately, when we POPed, he was one of the most well liked Plt Sgts around, and he got a lot of us to actually pass BMT with flying colours.</div>
