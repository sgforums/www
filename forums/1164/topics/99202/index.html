            <div class='col-md body'>Not necessary in Singapore cos... hey, who are we gonna fight?<br><br>But in Israeli specs forces, thery have a course in combat survival called 'Krav Maga' or 'contact combat'... Trainees are simply bashed up by several instructors...  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_eek.gif" alt="Shocked" title="Shocked"> They think it is necessary to make their soldiers be comfortable with contact... Though in recent times, they have modified it after some trainees sustained permanent injuries...<br><br>Abuse seems a little extreme, but our soldiers need to be trained to be comfortable with 'contact' for personal survival IF there is a war... either through boxing matches, unarmed combat or some form of 'contact' training... Cos there's no guarantee you won't run out of ammo when the enemy is in the same trench as you!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_confused.gif" alt="Confused" title="Confused"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>ask you guys a question, do u guys HONESTLY BELIEVE the crap that our soldiers can fight to win a war? the bulk of our soldiers come not from regular serice or even NSF but from the Reservists. yet looking at the attitute of the reservists, i have very serious doubts. and these R the ones who went tru the so-called 2G trg. hmm. r they tough? most of them r so fat n flabby even a pig would b ashamed!!<br>and let's not forget that singapore isn't that great an area after all. by the time war reaches our shores, they'll be within striking distances of every important place we have here. so where do we fight our wars? of course overseas right? is anyone so naive as to think that all countries allow uarmed forces to land on their lands and procede to blast say. oh their fields and roads as war explode around them?! NO!<br>my thinking? singapore will never go to war and if it does, it'll call up the US and other countries for repayment of favours!</div>
