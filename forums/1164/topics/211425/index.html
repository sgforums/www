Night-vision equipment allows soldiers to fight in complete darkness without using visible light.<br><br>'With enhanced superior knowledge and precision engagement capabilities, our future warrior's situational awareness is raised and their survivability is enhanced,' he added.<br><br>'Given the knowledge of the enemies' whereabouts, the soldier will have the ability to execute precise tactical engagement before being engaged by the enemy.'<br></strong></blockquote><br><br><strong><a href="http://www.dsta.gov.sg/home/DisplayPage/ContentPage12.asp?id=1264" rel="nofollow">Closer look of future soldier</a></strong><br><br><strong><a href="http://www.dsta.gov.sg/home/DisplayPage/ContentPage12.asp?id=1294" rel="nofollow">another look of hi tech soldier,more graphic info</a></strong><br><br><strong><a href="http://www.dsta.gov.sg/home/Display/Content11.asp?id=417&amp;loc=#591" rel="nofollow">so many.check it out urself lah</a></strong></div>

This seamless integration results in a more effective and efficient, unified combat force, significantly enhancing co-ordinated operations between the intra- and inter-fighting units Â– allowing the soldier to see and fight better on the battlefield.<br><br>Leveraging on technology, the ACMS enhances the soldierÂ’s lethality, situational awareness and survivability. The soldier is equipped with a battlefield monitoring system, navigation capabilities that enables him to manoeuvre quickly and accurately in engaging enemy targets from unexpected directions. He is part of the digitised battlefield that provides a superior situation awareness, allowing him to make informed decisions and take quick action.<br><br>With improved weaponry, such as the Round Corner Firing, the soldierÂ’s survivability is enhanced as he can fire around corners, from behind cover and from remote platforms while minimally exposing himself to enemy fire.<br><br>The Advanced Combat Man System will achieve a quantum improvement in the soldierÂ’s fighting capabilities through :<br><strong>Connectivity</strong><br>..........Networked to his peers, manned and unmanned platforms<br><strong>Situation Awareness</strong><br>..........Monitoring of positions of own forces and enemies<br>..........GPS/Map navigation<br><strong>Lethality</strong><br>..........Indirect aiming<br>..........Responsive fire support<br><strong>Inter-operability</strong><br>..........Seamless operations with other fighting systems<br><strong>Survivability</strong><br>..........Body Armour</blockquote></div>
