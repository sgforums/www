I was from RSAF TASC and I have had conversations with many senior pilots and worked with them before (hence gaining a understanding on their adminstrative and command skills) - but I have never had the opportunity to really know how good they are on the stick or what qualified them as pilots in the first place.  And I don't think many people here do either.<br><br>Given our limited experiences and understanding on how good existing RSAF pilots are on the stick as well as their aplitude, it is highly difficult to take them as references for our discussions on potential candidate requirements.  So to use a term cavsg and Viper52's coined, let's just participate in the "xiao di di" club and have a fun and informative time dabbling in our own amateur discussions.<br><br>If everybody knows what they want to know or would not accept anything without actual accurate facts at all, then we won't have this forum here would we?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>

Yes, the US Airforce REDFLAG somewhere in the desert, I believe in Las Vegas.

In the latter case, I was actually there and, seeing the ground past my canopy, I wasn't too impressed by this particular flyboy's inability to distinguish between 115 and 135 (neither were the pathfinders, by the way).<br><br>BTW, Laplace, as a psychologist I've worked with the RAAF on part of their pilot selection process - the qualities I mentioned in my first post are amongst those consisdered essential to the ability to perform the job.

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote>Originally posted by NathanG5:<br>[b]<br><br>blue n blue incident dun happen? oh my..u come up on that one right? dun just look at us only..look at the American..remmeber anything from Iraq War..remember the convoy lead by a group of spec ops? the one where they almost win the war..hanging America flags on their vehicle? im sure its not that murky...so i guess we have to blame it on the spec ops people..they were just in the wrong place at the wrong time.. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"> </blockquote>Since when did I say blue on blue don't happen?<br><br>It was you who assume that I was pointing out that <span style="font-style: italic;">blue on blue </span>does not happen usually. If anything, 50 percent of GF1 losses were due to friendly fire. Drawing from lessons learnt GF2, this proportion went down considerably. Now the greatest danger to combat ground troops is driving accidents... time to blame army drivers?<br><br><blockquote>oic..now we are blaming the other service who are not pro enough?<br>oic..okok..seriously..i dun see much of a news on guys kena on guys at the land service..</blockquote>That's where the broad span of your ignorance is well shown. Apparently your only inking of the typical friendly fire incident is a plane bombing the wrong targets... which recieves good coverage from CNN. The truth is, blue on blue is far, far more common on the land then in the air, with far greater losses. From getting muddled and simply shooting at the wrong position, trigger happy sentries, to a tank mistaking that M113 for a BTR. Mispositioned air strikes are the least of your worries because it's far easier to communicate the situtation to an aircraft then the ground troop.<br><br>Statstically, In war, your you should be worried about getting shot and shelled by your own troops more then bombs falling on you accidently. I don't see you talking about how you are more worried about that happening. Apparently either you have double standards or are just "plane" ignoramus.<br><br><blockquote>read up the whole issue up there...so now we cant blame the pilot for making any mistake..becos most likely they cant recognise u..n its the G.Is fault when they kena bomb? cos maybe wrong coordinates were given by G.Is? so the pilots hands are clean? its that simple explain by u?</blockquote>No, there are plenty of factors factoring into blue on blue and that goes far beyond a simplistic and sweeping idea of the hod rod pilot who is all to happy to bomb anything that moves.<br><br>Blue on blue usually happens when there is a misidentifying of target (most common), wrong cordinates (very often), miscommunication and sometimes even because some of the ground idiots called in fire near their position without considering the splash damage effect of cluster munitions or naplam tanks or CEP of bombs to plain incompetence on both parts. Trigger happiness is prehaps the furthest<br><br>Our RSAF pilots are far from incompetent in hitting their targets, and if you die from friendly fire it was because they thought you were the enemy and were really trying to kill you.<br><br>Trigger happiness is more of an aliment of the land rather then the air force, go ask any medic who treat such injuries.<br><br>The solution for friendly fire lies not in blaming either side, but building up better communication and situtational awareness. No pilot in his right mind would want to bomb friendly troops, unless they are as annoy as you that is, but I don't think the rest of us grunts are as ignoramus as you.<br><br><blockquote>there u go..u put words into my finger..i never say anything on not engaging without air support..in fact i need every single service Land Air N Sea to back me up...are u trying to say otherwise?<br>[b]</blockquote>Nope, I'm just pointing out that your fears of getting bombed are misplaced, you should be far more afriad of getting shot by your buddies accidently, taking friendly grenades, having sg arty fall on you, and having an AMX-13 running over you in the heat of battle and crushing you to a pulp.<br><br>If anything, modern CAS is often a precision affair, in Somalia Little Birds sucessfully strafed and held back a city of angry Somalis just across the road from the Rangers in the ground. Taken for granted, the air elements usually remove and soften up much of the resistence before your complianing butt actually hits the ground to do your job. Maybe you would like to think twice and keep your latent agressivness in check before you start questioning their competence in general.</div>

Compare this to WW2 where 600 American G.Is were killed by falling stray bombs in a single attack.<br><br><blockquote>indeed they were precision enough to hit their own guy..seem my words on the spec ops convoy incident is ignore..not worth abit to discuss? how about War On Terrorism in Afghan? can u remember any news on pilots killing their own on land?</blockquote>Are you insane? Have you not put more then a piscosecond of thought before you posted? The reason why friendly fire from the air now is so deadily is because the weapons and aircraft themselves are far, far better at getting their munitions onto the target then ever before. Even with unguided weapons, the CEP from aircraft can be as low as 20 feet.<br><br>Unlike you which can miss at 300 meters, a manverick can hit within a 3 foot circle from over 3km. Go figure. Precision? You have no idea what you are babbling about.<br><br>Those pilots misidentified what they were supposed to kill and they killed it. They were not imcompetent at their job of hitting targets, in fact, the truth is, they are so good at hitting and killing their targets, that when they aim at anything, be it enemy or not, it is as good as dead.<br><br>Precision and what target is actually killed are two different matters. I am amazed you could claim such a point.<br><br>And of course, if you would like to bring up these incidents, would you like to explain how the numbers of thousands of precision CAS sorties carried out in support of friendly troops happened without incident? Is friendly fire from the air as big as a problem as you are making it out to be? Or is it just an unfortunate, but ultimately unusual failure that happens in the fog of war that has little bearing on the precision of the weapons or the competence of the pilot?<br><br><blockquote>u claim that our pilot are not incompetence? how do you know? </blockquote>Because staying alive as a pilot is a lot harder then staying alive as a grunt. You are in an environment where doing even slightly stupid things will get you killed. Contray to what you may like to think, crazy, risk taking pilots in the fast jets will be the first to die before they can even do any crazy flying stunts to scare you.<br><br>The fact that we have such a low rate of accidents, compared to some countries and a country up north, especially with how they have come out favourably with other air forces in exercises, proves that our pilots as a force hardly have attitude of incompentence throughout them. Cocky some may be, but actually incompetent? I doubt it.<br><br>You want an incompetent airforce? Try Iraq.<br><br><blockquote>look at this picture now..<br>one using sophisticated technology..the other using an old age M-16..the one using the high tech stuff kill his own grunts on the ground...the other does the same thing.. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br>..</blockquote>I have already addressed this point. Aquiring the correct target and killing a target are two different things.<br><br>In which case, aquiring the correct target is based on many factors like intelligence, being on the right side of the line, not looking like enemy troops, and good communication. If all these work and the pilot <span style="font-style: italic;">still</span> bombs and kill friendly troops, then he can be considered incompetent...<br><br>In all the suggested measures to curb aerial friendly fire, have you seen a "Increase pilot competence" one yet? No, because everybody, except you prehaps, knows that the pilots are already doing everything that is possible to avoid targeting friendly troops, but unfortunately thanks to the fog of war, it will happen thanks to murphy's law.<br><br><blockquote>have u ever chat with a dude..with 3 crabs on his shoulder on how he feel about younger generation of pilots?</blockquote>I believe his grouses are more with their attitude, rather then their actual level of competence. If they were incompetent, he would be dead by their misadventures by now.<br><br>And of course, if he's land or sea, he probably dosen't know half of what he's talking about.<br><br><blockquote>we have more risk on the ground...all we hope for is a precision combat air support</blockquote>And you already have it, modern CAS, is far, far more effective, precise, deadily and safer to friendly troops then it had been in Vietnam and WW2, the annoying thing about your ramblings, is that all that whining about friendly fire and hoping for precision combat air support is pretty moot, for you already have the best of the best at your disposal.<br><br>In which case, your posts are pretty akin to whining about why your M-16 can't shoot nuclear missiles.<br><br><blockquote>wait a min here...did i say anything about Air Support not useful at all?<br>did u assume much of the things here yourself?<br>or trying to defend something u wish to be?</blockquote>Nope, but apparently you have a very distorted view of it. And as I have pointed out, most of your ramblings are greatly illogical and based more on emotion (hence the excessive use of emoticons to make no point) then logic AND AN ACTUAL STUDY OF FACTS INTO the subject.<br><br><blockquote>have u been on a chopper..where the pilots think its funny to scare u with their amazing flying skill.. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"> </blockquote>Bad incident with a bad individual does not make the entire force in general bad... and you are alive today ain't it? So the problem was the pilot's cocky attitude and not his competence. So what's with all the rethoric about incompetent, wrong stuff pilots?<br><br>[quote]oh so im annoying just becos i post my thoughts?<br>oh yea..i like it when that happen.<br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br>so much for frenly discussion.. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br></div></blockquote>No the problem is not because you post your thoughts, it is because your thoughts do not contain much thoughts behind them.
