            <div class='col-md body'>Good points guys.  With so many diversified views on what it takes to be a RSAF pilot, it's very difficult to simply point and say "he or she has/not the right stuff" isn't it?<br><br>Quite frankly I think that unless you have strapped yourself into the cockpit of a military aircraft and flown in one prior to enlisting (which is nigh impossible in the local context), I doubt we can ever determine who is pilot material or not.  I should think many people who have the "siao on" mentality and think that they know alot about piloting would be in for a rude shock when their dream realises.  Similarly, civilian pilots or people that dabble around computer simulation programs will not be guaranteed an easier "been there done that" time; learning and becoming a warfighting pilot is a totally different experience I should think.  Flying is only one attribute, your mentality and pysche is equally important.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Nobody knows for sure who will make it to become a pilot, or to pinpoint all the characteristics required to be a good pilot. Having the right attitude (ie willingness to learn) and having the aptitude (hand-eye coordination etc.) are important factors that instructors screening pilot trainees look for, but more importantly you need to have the interest in flying. Unfortunately no one truly know whether they will have a genuine interest in flying until they have tasted flight itself.<br>At the end of it all, it is a combination of factors that determine if anyone makes it as a pilot. No one knows for sure what they all are, that's why they label it the X-factor.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I do believe it was 1992 or 1993 - this was in the batch just before mine.  Four guys were on the skids and the pilot released the ropes.  The company 2 i/c was one of the despatchers and managed to grab one of the guys but the other three dropped.  My CSM was supervising from the ground and his heart stopped when he saw them drop - his first thought was that the ropes weren't tied properly around the carabiners.  I believe the pilot received a suspended 8-year sentence.</div>
