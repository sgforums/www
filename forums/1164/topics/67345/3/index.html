I am amazed you could claim such a point.<br><br>And of course, if you would like to bring up these incidents, would you like to explain how the numbers of thousands of precision CAS sorties carried out in support of friendly troops happened without incident?

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by HENG@:</div><div class="quote_body">Nathan DID say they have the precision to kill their own people. thats what u've REINFORCED.</div></blockquote>My point was, precision or inprecision, is irrevelant to the issue of friendly fire. However, what I have been simply pointing out was that <span style="font-style: italic;">due to </span>precision weapons, friendly fire incidents have gotten more deadly due to the increased lethality of these weapons in killing their target, and not because they have gotten more common.<br><br>In prespective, prevention of blue on blue incidents have made large strides since WW2.<br><br>Nathan's "point" was an irrevelant escapade pretty much scoffing the use of high tech precision weapons to kill friendly troops, which if you look at the issue, is pretty irrevelant. After all, once launched at a target, friendly or not, the bomb does not care a whit and will do what it was supposed to do, which is to explode.<br><br>It's amazing how you attempt to reconcile reason and rhetoric.<br><br><blockquote><strong>anyway from what u've said above, that is called PILOT INCOMPETENCE.</strong></blockquote><br><br>No it is not. And to say so would be a irresponsible and dangerous ignorace of the <strong>real reasons</strong> that cause friendly fire, which range from a confused picture on the ground, friendly troops failing to identify themselves properly, lack of communciation, all of which hardly fall on the shoulders of the pilot. All these factors, added up, and finally causing the pilot to misidentify a target and engage it with precision firepower, is hardly a case of pilot incompetence, he was just doing what he was supposed to do.<br><br>He is not any more liable then the arty battery which shells friendly troops when supplied with misinformation.<br><br>In fact, in many of the blue on blue cases, the pilots themselves have taken every normal precaution to avoid them, and they still happen. Are they incompetent? I doubt it.<br><br>No, the true reason behind most blue on blue incidents is misinformation, lack of communication, and the fog of war, not pilot incompetence.<br><br>Blaming pilot incompetence is an illogical, and utterly irresponsible way of approaching the issue, because the real reasons do not get addressed and more men are still going to get torn up.<br><br>How can the pilot be held liable for many factors that are not within his control?<br><br>When can a pilot be considered incompetent? When every attempt has been made to inform him of the presence of ground troops and he still goes in to bomb them anyway.<br><br>Apparently logic has slipped from your grasp, to make such grandose claims that insult the airman as a crew.<br><br><blockquote><strong><br>u know what? a friendly life lost IS a life lost. can we stop talking in terms of percentages and start talking about needless deaths here? Those pilots should keep the blue on blue kills at 0%. and thats it. no compromise.</strong></blockquote>That's because examining the precentages and numbers helps us to put the entire thing into prespective, if you have no prespective, you have no handle on the problem, without a handle, you cannot have a chance of solving it and all you have is a ton of hot air in your hot head which can spout a lot of rhetoric but little solid solutions.<br><br>The first reaction when a friendly fire happens is to blame the pilot for dropping the bomb, but any rational head afterwards can see that most of these cases are due to failures on both sides, in many cases, that of the ground people who failed to take the necessary precautions or communicate their position properly to the aircraft.<br><br>In many cases, the pilot's only involvement in the FF was to engage the target, the mistakes made on the ground crew on their part already sealed their fates. That's why in many investigations of air-ground FF cases, the pilot is found to have little blame(as was the case when an A-10 exploded two British Warrior IFVs who failed to put their identification panels killing 12)<br><br>Keeping blue on blue kills as 0 percent is a wishful thing, prehaps as likely as thaking 0 percent losses in war. But what we can do is to try to reduce them as much as possible doing everything that is pratically sound.<br><br>Unfortunately, leaving the onus of preventing them on the pilot's hands, having examined the issue, is hardly the solution. They are already doing what they pratically can. (Want to have no risk of FF? Don't shoot anything) The main problem has always rested with ground crews not doing enough to provide the air crews with enough information or communicating properly.<br><br></div>

No! But I have been trying to put them into prespective.<br><br>Basically, what you are doing here is akin to a automobile driver ranting and raving about how air travel is so terrible and unsafe when at the end of the day, people are many, many times more likely to die or get seriously injured in an automobile accident and air travel (next to esclator travel), is the safest form of transport in the world.<br><br>The truth is, most modern air forces, at leas the ones we are discussing (RSAF/USAF) are extremely professional and do their job to the best of our ability. The RSAF itself is literally obessesed with safety. Go read their work mottos and observe how they work. At almost every step there is accountability to this and that person. Any mistake, even a slight one that may risk man or equipment affects the offender far more severly then if you were in land at sea.<br><br>Do US jets cut cables three or four times a month? Do they rake up over 100 road pizzas from speed drops every exercise?<br><br>Those who do such things dissappear from the force pretty fast and dishonourably, and there are plenty of checks in the system to weed out this kind of behaviour before it gets serious. Unfortunately there is no such thing as a perfect system, and some of these jokers will get through like the Commando Instr. who drowned that poor guardsman in POW training.<br><br>Are those jokers who cut the cable still flying navy jets today?<br><br>Basically what you are expecting is a 0 percent accident rate from human beings and their machines, any engineer can tell you that your aspirations are insane.<br><br>Highly trained or not, any high risk operation like that special ops one is very dangerous, and even the experts will mess up. To blame everything it on one force and expect them to preform perfectly everytime is a fool's errand.<br><br>In fact it's easy to see how even with perfect pilots who take every precaution, air to ground FFs will still happen as long as the ground troops don't take steps to overcome their part of the bargain. It takes two hands to clap. If you are just going to sit here and ask for perfect pilots, who can identify you, a single person in a littorial, target rich environment through the fog of war when you on your part do nothing to indicate to him you are friendly except blithely whine about bad pilots on your laptop in your foxhole. I'm afraid you're just gonna get bombed.</div>

Since that incident, aircraft now only bomb under detailed information and the final go-ahead now rests with the operator calling the airstrike.

            <div class='col-md body'>By the way it would be nice to aquiant yourself with the Murphy's Law of Combat:<br><br><strong>1. No fire is friendly.</strong><br><br>2. Recoilless rifles - aren't.<br><br>3. Suppressive fires - won't.<br><br>4. You are not Superman; Marines and fighter pilots take note.<br><br>5. A sucking chest wound is Nature's way of telling you to slow down.<br><br>6. If it's stupid but it works, it isn't stupid.<br><br>7. Try to look unimportant; the enemy may be low on ammo and not want to waste a bullet on you.<br><br>8. If at first you don't succeed, call for artillery. When that doesn't work, for an airstrike.<br><br>9. The further you are in advance of your own positions, the more likely your artillery will fall short.<br><br>10. Never share a foxhole with anyone braver than yourself.<br><br>11. Never go to bed with anyone crazier than yourself.<br><br>12. Never forget that your weapon was made by the lowest bidder.<br><br>13. If your attack is going really well, it's an ambush.<br><br>14. The enemy diversion you're ignoring is their main attack.<br><br>16. "No battle plan ever survives contact with the enemy."- Field Marshall Helmuth Carl Bernard von Moltke [1990's version: No OPLAN ever survives initial contact.]<br><br>17. There is no such thing as a perfect plan.<br><br>18. Five second fuses always burn three seconds.<br><br>19. There is no such thing as an atheist in a foxhole.<br><br>20. A retreating enemy is probably just falling back and regrouping.<br><br>21. The important things are always simple; the simple are always hard.<br><br>22. The problem with taking easy way out is that the enemy has already mined it.<br><br>23. Teamwork is essential; it gives the enemy other people to shoot at.<br><br>24. Don't look conspicuous. In the combat zone, it draws fire. Out of the combat zone, it draws sergeants. [Corollary: For this reason, it is not at all uncommon for aircraft carriers to be known as bomb magnets.]<br><br>25. Never draw fire; it irritates everyone around you.<br><br>26. If you are short of everything but the enemy, you are in the combat zone.<br><br>27. When you have secured the area, make sure the enemy knows it too.<br><br>28. Incoming fire has the right of way.<br><br>29. No combat ready unit has ever passed inspection.<br><br>30. No inspection ready unit has ever passed combat.<br><br>31. If the enemy is within range, so are you.<br><br>32. The only thing more accurate than incoming enemy fire is incoming friendly fire.<br><br>33. Things which must be shipped together as a set, aren't.<br><br>34. Things that must work together, can't be carried to the field that way.<br><br>35. Radios will fail as soon as you need fire support. (Corollary: Radar tends to fail at night and in bad weather, and especially during both.)<br><br>36. Anything you do can get you killed, including nothing.<br><br>37. Make it too tough for the enemy to get in, and you won't be able to get out.<br><br>38. Tracers work both ways.<br><br>39. If you take more than your fair share of objectives, you will get more than your fair share of objectives to take.<br><br>40. When both sides are convinced they're about to lose, they're both right.<br><br>41. Professional soldiers are predictable; the world is full of dangerous amateurs.<br><br>42. When your fear of the plane overcomes your fear of the ejection seat, its time to "punch out."<br><br>43. Military Intelligence is a contradiction.<br><br>44. Fortify your front; you'll get your rear shot up.<br><br>45. The more a weapon costs, the farther you will have to send it away to be repaired.<br><br>46. Weather ain't neutral.<br><br>47. If you can't remember, the Claymore is pointed towards you.<br><br>48. Air defense motto: shoot 'em down; sort 'em out on the ground.<br><br>49. 'Flies high, it dies; low and slow, it'll go.<br><br>50. The Cavalry doesn't always come to the rescue.<br><br>51. Napalm is an area support weapon.<br><br>52. Mines are equal opportunity weapons.<br><br>53. B-52s are the ultimate close support weapon.<br><br>54. Sniper's motto: reach out and touch someone.<br><br>55. Killing for peace is like screwing for virginity.<br><br>56. The one item you need is always in short supply.<br><br>57. Interchangeable parts aren't.<br><br>58. It's not the one [bullet] with your name on it; it's the one [bullet or shrapnel] addressed "to whom it may concern" or "occupant" that you've got to worry about.<br><br>59. When in doubt, empty your magazine.<br><br>60. The side with the simplest uniforms wins. [Corollary: The army with the smartest dress uniform will lose.]<br><br>61. Combat will occur on the ground between two adjoining maps...printed at different scales.<br><br>62. If the Platoon Sergeant can see you, so can the enemy.<br><br>63. Never stand when you can sit, never sit when you can lie down, never stay awake when you can sleep.<br><br>64. The most dangerous thing in the world is a Second Lieutenant with a map and a compass.<br><br>65. Exceptions prove the rule, and destroy the battle plan.<br><br>66. Everything always works in your HQ, everything always fails in the Colonel's HQ.<br><br>67. The enemy never watches until you make a mistake.<br><br>68. One enemy soldier is never enough, but two is entirely too many.<br><br>69. A clean (and dry) set of BDU's is a magnet for mud and rain.<br><br></div>

Whenever you are low on ammo, you can't hit the broad side of a barn.<br><br>72. The complexity of a weapon is inversely proportional to the IQ of the weapon's operator.<br><br>73. Field experience is something you don't get until just after you need it.<br><br>74. No matter which way you have to march, its always uphill.<br><br>75. If enough data is collected, a board of inquiry can prove anything.<br><br>76. For every action, there is an equal and opposite criticism. (in boot camp)<br><br>77. Airstrikes always overshoot the target, artillery always falls short.<br><br>78. When reviewing the radio frequencies that you just wrote down, the most important ones are always illegible.<br><br>79. Those who hesitate under fire usually do not end up KIA or WIA.<br><br>80. The tough part about being an officer is that the troops don't know what they want, but they know for certain what they don't want.<br><br>81. To steal information from a person is called plagiarism. To steal information from the enemy is called gathering intelligence.<br><br>82. The weapon that usually jams when you need it the most is the M60.<br><br>83. The perfect officer for the job will transfer in the day after that billet is filled by someone else.<br><br>84. When you have sufficient supplies &amp; ammo, the enemy takes 2 weeks to attack.

[Corollary: The effective radius of a hand grenade is greater the average grunt can throw it.]<br><br>91. All-weather close air support doesn't work in bad weather.<br><br>92. The combat worth of a unit is inversely proportional to the smartness of its outfit and appearance.<br><br>93. The crucial round is a dud.<br><br>94. Every command which can be misunderstood, will be.<br><br>95. There is no such place as a convenient foxhole.<br><br>96. Don't ever be the first, don't ever be the last and don't ever volunteer to do anything.<br><br>97. If your positions are firmly set and you are prepared to take the enemy assault on, he will bypass you.<br><br>98. If your ambush is properly set, the enemy won't walk into it.<br><br>99. If your flank march is going well, the enemy expects you to outflank him.<br><br>100. Density of fire increases proportionally to the curiousness of the target.15. The enemy invariably<br><br>101. Odd objects attract fire - never lurk behind one. [Corollary: Odd objects attract fire -- you are odd.]<br><br>102. The more stupid the leader is, the more important missions he is ordered to carry out.<br><br>103. The self-importance of a superior is inversely proportional to his position in the hierarchy (as is his deviousness and mischievousness).<br><br>104. There is always a way, and it usually doesn't work.<br><br>105. Success occurs when no one is looking, failure occurs when the General is watching.<br><br>106. The enemy never monitors your radio frequency until you broadcast on an unsecured channel.<br><br>107. Whenever you drop your equipment in a fire-fight, your ammo and grenades always fall the farthest away, and your canteen always lands at your feet.<br><br>108. As soon as you are served hot chow in the field, it rains.<br><br>109. Never tell the Platoon Sergeant you have nothing to do.<br><br>110. The seriousness of a wound (in a fire-fight) is inversely proportional to the distance to any form of cover.<br><br>111. Walking point = sniper bait.<br><br>112. Your bivouac for the night is the spot where you got tired of marching that day.<br><br>113. If only one solution can be found for a field problem, then it is usually a stupid solution.<br><br>114. The buddy system is essential to your survival; it gives the enemy somebody else to shoot at.<br><br>115. The Quartermaster has only two sizes, too large and too small.<br><br>116. If you really need an officer in a hurry, take a nap.<br><br>117. The only time suppressive fire works is when it is used on abandoned positions.<br><br>118. There is nothing more satisfying than having someone take a shot at you, and miss.<br><br>119. All battles are fought uphill.<br><br>120. All battles are fought in the rain.<br><br>121.

Failure reinforces itself.<br><br>128. "Only 5% of an intelligence report is accurate. The trick of a good commander is to isolate the 5%." -- General Douglas MacArthur<br><br>129. When a front line soldier overhears two General Staff officers conferring, he's fallen back too far.<br><br>130.

Priorities are made by officers, not God. There's a difference.<br><br>135. Always honor a threat.<br><br>136. The weight of all your equipment is proportional to the cube of the time you have been carrying it.<br><br>137. "Hell hath no fury like a non-combatant." -- Charles Edward Montague<br><br>138. Fighter pilots make movies; attack pilots make history.<br><br>139. There are two kinds of naval vessels: submarines and targets.<br><br>140.

"A little caution outflanks a large cavalry." -- Otto von Bismark<br><br>144. The enemy diversion you are ignoring is the main attack.<br><br>145. Radios function perfectly until you need fire support.<br><br>146. If you take more than your fair share of objectives, you will have more than your fair share to take.<br><br>147. Parade ground inspections are to combat readiness as mess hall food is to cuisine.<br><br>148. "Snow is not neutral." -- Frunze Military Academy Maxim<br><br>149.

"He who wants to defend everything defends nothing." -- Frederick the Great<br><br>154. If they're shooting at you, its a high intensity conflict.<br><br>155. Artillery add dignity to what would otherwise be a vulgar brawl.<br><br>156. Minefields are not neutral. They attack both enemies.<br><br>157. Your mortar barrage will put exactly one round on the intended target. That round will be a dud.<br><br>158. The mortar team will always have the correct number of safety pins to prove they armed all the rounds. [Corollary: To ensure this, the mortar teams always carry extra pins.]<br><br>159. More aircraft are incapacitated by a shortage of spare parts than by enemy action.<br><br>160. The enemy attacks on two occasions: 1) when they're ready, 2) when you're not.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>ST, granted that there have been instances where crazy flying has served its purpose.  However, looking your examples, there is one common thread that runs through them: desperate times call for desperate measures.<br><br>Sure, I know how to perform emergency braking, but does that mean that I slam on the brakes 25 metres from every red light I come across?  That would be plain stupid behaviour, would it not?  If you were driving behind someone who does emergency braking unnecessarily, I put it you you that you would not be particularly impressed with his driving skills.<br><br>If I were flying over a hot DZ, I wouldn't mind jumping at too high a speed - the situation calls for it.  Hell, I wouldn't even mind jumping in a non-DZ.  However, if there's no such reason for doing that, I wouldn't care too much for dumb stunts, thank you very much.  I've got a difficult enough job to do without some hotshot making sure I've got a whole lot of extra twists in my risers, and having them while I'm almost upside-down to boot.  That is just plain uncalled for, and I reserve my right to opine that if the bugger at the wheel was any more of an arsehole, he'd collapse in on himself.  If you want to acsribe that to the lack of air legs, I'd like to see that backed up by a pair of wings.  In a position where you live with a reasonably high level of risk, such as being a paratrooper or, as in Heng's case, racing cars, the first thing you learn if you're going to be around to learn anything else is that you do not take any <strong>unnecessary</strong> risks.  What you're doing is risky enough as it is, and you don't want to push your luck.<br><br>I hold your posting in high enough regard to keep from calling you an armchair Rambo, but I reckon that dog you got there just don't hunt.  Your opinion is that a few black sheep are rapidly weeded out under a merciless system.

I myself happen to be alive enough to offer a different perspective, not gleaned from tidied-up written reports but from personal experience.  I put it to you that the selection and training system has not weeded out idiots who cannot perform what every licensed driver is expected to do - monitor and control their speed.<br><br>I reiterate my original point: I hope that our CAS pilots are better than our chopper and C-130 pilots.  Logically speaking, if a pilot were the best amongst his peers, it is unlikely that he would be flying a trash-hauler.  Let's get one thing straight.  I'm not saying that our air force is incompetent - I have not seen the best of the lot and as such cannot present an opinion of the overall situation.  However, I do know the runts of the litter and their work, and the minimum standard that they represent is far from impressive.<strong></strong></div>

It's amazing how you can contuine to cling to the "pilot never radio back" completely ignoring all that led up to the incident... which started with a spec operations operative on the ground who was too hasty to give specific coordinates, confirmed the fire mission and target type, and told the pilot to go ahead to bomb the target.<br><br>To insist on blaming the pilot come what may, is prehaps akin to blaming american WW2 tank commanders of being incompetent because they took heavy losses fighting German tanks in their inpotent M4 Shermans that had been designed by a compromise committe. And make grandose claims on how tank commanders should be more competent in fighting German armour. See the real issue here?<br><br>You have yet to produce any solid evidence supporting your case of pilot fault except from your vague, personal impressions of the whole incident gleamed from BBC. Ironically, even the BBC operators INVOLVED in the incident hold a far more rational, and objective view of the incident then you do. Just look at their report.<br><br>If you think I haven't been reading up, I urge you then, for my and everybody's benefit, post the links here. Other then that, your opinions of this incident and it's credibility as an argument is as thin as figurative paper. Airchair generals make hotheaded, simplistic claims, true soldiers acess the true, tatical picyure.<br><br>It would behoove you to stop shadow boxing, it's far more productive then posting irrational thoughts followed by more irrational reasons pulled out of thin air to support them.</div>

Why? Because the real issue is completely missed and blame is heaped on the hapless recipent.<br><br>Consider the case of Nathan, after which even any half-blind person can see that the "spec ops" friendly fire incident was caused by a number of aggrivated factors, vauge information and just plain poor SOP, he can still come out and point fingers at the pilot, whoes actual involvement in the events that led up to the bombing is anything but comprehensive.<br><br>Unfortunately, hotheads with such a poor understanding of the issue such as himself are the ones who are going to get us killed in war.<br><br><blockquote><strong><br>Teo Chee Hean himself said that there would be a new era of transparency in the SAF.

Diddling around with the vauge notion of "pilot competence" as a cure all for accidents?<br><br>If you want me to write on what can be addressed in the air force, no problem, they have just about as many things to fix in terms of SOP and chain of command.

And when injuries do happen, a large proportion of it is due to factors that have little to do with piloting. This leaves a very small number of actual pilot causes, and out of these, we can split them up into, unintended human error, circumstances, and finally incompetence.<br><br>How much of it is actually incompetence?<br><br>The problem is, I see little reason to attack the issue of jump injuries by addressing pilot incompetence itself when spending a tons of time and resources just to completley patch up that area until you have infalliable pilots is nonsensical when it does not reduce the actual number of jump/rope fatalities by a lot. I would rather, as the SAF is doing, attack the problem as a whole by becoming more transparent, being merciless with jokers who play dice with people's lives and establishing better operating procedures to avoid such mishaps.<br><br>The fact that the rope incident does not happen every season means that this is a one-off incident, and not a problem we should split hairs over.<br><br><blockquote><strong><br>Maybe you're being deliberately obtuse, but which part of my post don't you understand?

Why don't you ask them who know their stuff if they are taking unnecessary risks? Instead of blithely complaining from your prespective of a ground troop? If you know any air force friends, ask them about what would happen to the crew and their mates if one of them happened to mess up.<br><br>Unlike the commandos, the air force certainly does not have an atmosphere that encourages or condones mindless risk taking with lives and equipment.<br><br><blockquote><strong>I'm not sure if you recall the long debate on the drowning incident.

The truth is, is the entire air force made out of jokers and is the air force actively condoning this mindset and behaviour?<br><br>I hardly think so. Most of the dudes in the air force are exactly the person next door who takes their job seriously, along with the responsibility they carry with them. It is no crime for a pilot to be cocky or take pride in his profession, or we should be condemming a lot of the 101st Airborne paratroopers. But while I he is cocky, he should and jolly well be knowing his stuff and living up to that reputation.<br><br>Do I have any respect professionally for pilots who fail that? Of course not. I am defending the large majority who do their job right, and on them should the reputation of the air force be based.<br><br>Seriously, the sentiment of the big bad air force versus the poor defenseless grunt who labours to protect his way of life is becoming ridiculusly overplayed here.</strong></div>
