If it's the latter, from which you can agree, since you agree the numbers tally up, you should work on rationalizing your doubts so you can focus on the real question.<br><br>Consider shark attacks, nobody likes the idea of it but is the risk of getting attacked by a shark anywhere near as bad as it appears to us? We can watch documentries on the topic, get survivor accounts and the like and consider these proof of the apparent "big" threat of shark attack, but in the end, do not far more people die from other means they don't even consider a big threat to their lives? Like bee stings or getting struck by lightning.<br><br>Also, with an unmoderated approach to the precieved risks based on our irrational doubts, are we doing the pilots any justice? As much as I hate being bombed by friendlies, it's better for us to locate the real reason, eliminate it, instead of doubting our pilots. Because our survival will almost certainly be dependent on them in war as well.<br><br>If we doubt them based on our prespective on incidents without truly sizing them up for what they are, we will not use them to the fullest, and men will get torn up and bleed for that.<br><br><blockquote><strong><br>we dun have transponders..we dun have much high tech equipment to prevent any FF..look thru our post on the FF issue..the American have the most high tech equipment in the world..<br>look at us again..we are just beginning to harness our technology knowledge..</strong></blockquote><br><br>Don't be too depressed, we do have some tricks up our sleeve for preventing FF, and there are probably some stuff that we would not know about up Mindef's sleeve. However, the key still lies in proper intelligence gathering and communication, all the technology in the world won't save us if we mess this up.<br><br><blockquote><strong>my base still uses AR-15...n some others old age equipment..<br>im defending an airbase..so i know my butt will be in a safe place..<br>cant help to think whats gona happen to our infantry boys..</strong></blockquote></div></blockquote><strong>Wouldn't the infantry boys who butt is on the line know better about the true risk of things? People like many of my friends? Having trained more then you in CAS, they would be the ones who know if they should trust or doubt the pilots or not.<br><br>If grunts especially those in combat did not trust the flyboys... then why do they still call down CAS even after well hyped friendly fire incidents?<br><br>Seems their main worry is not CAS, but arty misfire, save some disgrunted PARAmilitary personnel...<br><br>[quote]<strong>im not typing nonsense..<br>wana know the latest incident that happen?<br>2 F-16(variant unknown) land with two damage..<br>one with a scratch belly..one with a bended fin(what u call it? the tail fin?)<br><br>y it happen?  they did a unwarrant stunt..<br>yes..they are good enough to land safely..but to me they are not competent enough not to do it( the stunt)<br></strong>Brain dead incidents like these do happen, the thing is, if it does, these guys are no longer driving the planes anymore, the RSAF will not tolerate anybody fooling around or misdriving their precious aircraft.<br><br>Often these incidents also happen when agressior training goes wrong or when a slight miscalculation turns bad... many of the times, the pilots are not deliberately trying to be stupid but are placed into a situtation where their better discretion failed them.<br><br>So these guys are out.<br><br>In the end, the demographic of the pilots in our force will not be young people who love doing stupid things, who won't be around for too long, but professionals with a job and are willing to carry it out to the end. It's easy to fall for the movie sterotype of pilots or other elite outfits as a bunch of gunslingers, but is that true? Could our pilots do a Manverick and buzz the control tower at supersonic speed like in Top Gun? They have a lot to answer for.<br><br>That's why you should be very careful about the helicopter joyride stories you have heard, esp. when they come from the excited infantryman, we know how "precise" their information can be. If these incidents really happened as said, the pilots would have been court martialed out of a job, and maybe even end up with some time on their hands to think out their nice little stunts...</strong></div>

SA covers the tracking of all objects within a three-dimensional space, not only of the position of the object but of its nature (e.g. friend or foe).  The USS Vincennes incident is a classic example of SA failure, where all the correct data was collected, but was interpreted using the wrong framework - an Airbus on the radar was therefore misidentified as an enemy aircraft.<br><br>A few ways of testing SA have been designed, such as WOMBAT - however, these tests still require a lot of development and their progress follows research that defines measurable elements of SA.<br><br>If you want to look into SA more, I'd recommend Mica Endsley's work - her writing is very clear and makes for a good introduction.

As stress levels increase, the individual has a tendency to focus upon some of the salient (obvious) features of the situation, ignoring some of the less obvious but nonetheless important it of information.  While itÂ’s a part of the natural fight-or-flight response, it can be attenuated by training.<br><br>Another aspect that can be influenced by training is group SA Â– the SA shared by teams of people, such as flight crews.  In such cases, everybody must have the same understanding of the situation so that they do not end up working at odds with each other in a tight situation.  An ex-RAAF psychologist I worked under has gone and set up a consultancy in France, dealing with aircraft-related human factors issues including group SA.<br><br>In a nutshell, the jury is still out on whether one needs to specifically select for SA, or whether training can bring candidates up to an acceptable standard.  For the moment, though, SA tests such as WOMBAT are often being used in the selection process.<br><br>IÂ’ll have to riffle through my files to see if I have a softcopy of my report for the RAAF.

Your own incompetence in reading and comprehension. I'm not sure about Freud, but I think some people with even basic logic would have a field day with you.<br><br>In which case, given your amazing ability to misread posts here and jump into conclusions which always invariability somehow always falls back to focus on your own intellectual fortitude, a large part of which is greatly fictitious.
