It's amazing how you can contuine to cling to the "pilot never radio back" completely ignoring all that led up to the incident... which started with a spec operations operative on the ground who was too hasty to give specific coordinates, confirmed the fire mission and target type, and told the pilot to go ahead to bomb the target.<br><br>To insist on blaming the pilot come what may, is prehaps akin to blaming american WW2 tank commanders of being incompetent because they took heavy losses fighting German tanks in their inpotent M4 Shermans that had been designed by a compromise committe. And make grandose claims on how tank commanders should be more competent in fighting German armour. See the real issue here?<br><br>You have yet to produce any solid evidence supporting your case of pilot fault except from your vague, personal impressions of the whole incident gleamed from BBC.

            <div class='col-md body'>So youÂ’re saying that I almost ended up candling because I jumped too heavy, and not because the pilot was going 20 knots too fast?  I was doing a clean fatigue jump at the time, which means my weight was less than 65 kilograms.  Or, in your expert opinion, is that already too heavy?  Also, why would tailwinds, thermals, and unseen air currents affect airspeed?  All three contribute to a bumpy ride, which I have no issue with.<br><br>It appears that you are mixing up my posts with NathanÂ’s.  My stance has always been as follows: given my personal experience with pilots, my conclusion is that the process of weeding out pilots with an attitude problem that prevents them from doing the job right (NOT incompetent pilots) is inadequate.  It was in response to NathanÂ’s anecdote about the pilot saying that pilots are superior Â– my point is that they as fallible as the rest of us.  My arguments therefore address both human error and incompetence, but not circumstances.  Also, you seem to think that I have proposed some grandiose solutions Â– read my posts again and you will see that I have proposed no solutions, grandiose or otherwise.  So far I have not even gotten to identifying what to fix yet Â– thanks to the current direction of this argument, we cannot yet get to that point.<br><br>If youÂ’re getting so excited that you canÂ’t even remember who said what, perhaps it is you who is the hothead here.<br><br>It is not a case of taking a myopic or cellular view here.  You are proposing that the Air Force weeds out poor pilots, and I am debating your point Â– as the one proposing the point, the burden of proof is upon you.  All I need is a single piece of evidence disproving your point, and I already have two.<br><br>At this present point in time, I donÂ’t have any interest in your sweeping plans of how to fix the problem.  The issue here is simple Â– you said that they weed out all poor pilots and I disagreed with the two examples I presented, so why donÂ’t we just stick to that?  Your helicopterÂ’s flying all over the place, so your view is of little relevance to my point.<br><br>By the way, donÂ’t go embarrassing yourself trying to tell me about numbers.  My doctorate thesis was in statistical analysis, and of all people I know how numbers can be controlled to present a distorted version of the truth.  That is the importance of the disproof that I mentioned earlier Â– if the numbers contradict what you actually know from experience, betting odds are that the numbers are wrong.<br><br>With your example of crossing the road, I accept Â“most and Â“usualÂ” enough to take my chances crossing the road.  However, I am not as foolish as to use those numbers to propose that the driving test process weeds out all bad drivers.<br><br>With the rope incident, the very simple SOP of checking with the despatchers for an all-clear before pulling the release lever was already in place, and was violated by the pilot.  In the case of my jump, the pilot violated the 115 knot limit stipulated in the TSR.  IÂ’d classify these as unnecessary risks.<br><br><blockquote>Unlike the commandos, the air force certainly does not have an atmosphere that encourages or condones mindless risk taking with lives and equipment.</blockquote>Really now?  And upon what basis do you base the CommandosÂ’ attitude?  Having been one, and speaking from personal experience (as much as you are grieved by personal experience), I would heartily disagree with you.  Please refer to my posts in the drowning incident thread for an expansion of what I learned in Cdo.<br>You have no intention of contradicting yourself?  Hogwash:<br><br><blockquote> a few black sheep (which are rapidly weeded out under a merciless system) </blockquote><blockquote> I am defending the large majority who do their job right, and on them should the reputation of the air force be based. </blockquote>Or does your macro view absolve you from sticking to your statements?  First you categorically state that they are weeded out, then you say that there are some about.  WhatÂ’s it going to be?  My issue with you has always been the first statement Â– they are not weeded out, and thatÂ’s the point of my examples.  Look, the gist of what you have written subsequently indicates that you acknowledge that the selection system does let some idiots through.  Why donÂ’t you just retract your categorical statement about the weeding out (which you already have contradicted yourself about anyway), and then we can get on to bigger and better things?</div>

This is because these can actually make the plane go faster or slower then it really is (increase/reduce lift, drag and trust), and also play around with the instrument sensors, giving the pilot false readings. So while up in the cockpit, the pilot may be reading that he's going at the correct speed, the Herc itself is actually going a bit faster. And nobody is all the wiser.<br><br>Of course, if the Herc hit an air pocket while doing a jump (the kind which makes the news when it happens to CV airlines), the result could be disaster.<br><br>There are steps to minimise these problems but they cannot be avoided altogether, but it will happen, and will contuine to happen not because of our pilot ability but because we simply do not have technology to allow for on the knot Falcon 4.0 autopilot flying. So the jumpers go out into a surprisingly strong slipstream.<br><br>Of course I'm not saying that this is the case in all of the cases, but consider this: Why would any sane pilot want to play dice with people's lives just for kicks? Especially being a C-130 pilot, they would have been WARNED, not just told about the things that can go wrong when they do things wrongly during a jump, along with constant reminders of the punitive punishments for not heeding these warnings?<br><br>Would any even vaguely normal-quality RSAF C-130 pilot play dice with his job and the lives of all the jumpers just for kicks and to show off how he can do his job wrongly? Especially when the reward for such behaviour is not applause, but an tribunal and court martial.<br><br><blockquote><strong>It appears that you are mixing up my posts with NathanÂ’s.  My stance has always been as follows: given my personal experience with pilots, my conclusion is that the process of weeding out pilots with an attitude problem that prevents them from doing the job right (NOT incompetent pilots) is inadequate.</strong></blockquote><strong>/b]<br><br>What then would be an adequate system? One that weeds out all bad pilots? Such a system is ideal but is it attainable?<br><br>Our current selection system is second only to the IAF in weeding for the suitable candidate for our aircrew.<br><br>Out of 3,000 suitable hopefuls which fit the strict starting citeria ranging from everything from physical to mental tests, only 30 actually make it to train in aircraft, and out of these 30, only 3 finally get behind the helm of the RSAF's precious aircraft.<br><br>The thing is, they know that getting there is serious work, and that there are no shortage of candidates who would be willing to take their place should they screw up.<br><br>This is also coupled with a system they have to abide by that is completely no-nonsense and anal about safety. Everything must be done by the book and all of their moves are carefully watched. This means that after a bad jump or even a good one where not everything was followed to plan, they better have a good reason for so or they're lunchmeat.<br><br>The penalty for showing contempt or willfully disregarding these rules are severe, and usually clips one's wings.<br><br>For them, it is make or break, they have to do the job right because should anything go wrong, it is picked to pieces with every detail pored over. Even not sticking to their flight plan by as simple as +500 angel can cost them a lot. And if anything goes wrong, their necks are the first on the line.<br><br>Having family members in the force, I can know how strict the airforce is. Unlike the Commandos, the air force is not in the habit of protecting or condoning their pilots and any kind of laxness or fun with a multimillion dollar aircraft and the lives in their cargo hold.<br><br>In fact, the RSAF is so strict, that some in here have argued that these policies actually reduce our air force's combat effectiveness by creating pilots that are too cautious to do anything, or are tied up with tons of procedures and rules that operational ability is compromised.<br><br><blockquote>[b]It was in response to NathanÂ’s anecdote about the pilot saying that pilots are superior Â– my point is that they as fallible as the rest of us.  My arguments therefore address both human error and incompetence, but not circumstances.  </blockquote></strong><br><br>One only needs to look at any war fought in history to see if pilots are ever even close to being infaliable. If you have been getting the picture that I have been defending the notion of the infaliable pilot, I'm afriad you have just been responsible for a bad case of friendly fire, but I'm okay with that, this is "the fog of heated debate anyway".<br><br>As a matter of fact, one of the Murphy's laws of combat tells pilots not to think that they are supermen.<br><br>But my question is, are our pilots doing their very best? And are they doing their jobs to the best of their ability?<br><br><blockquote><strong>Also, you seem to think that I have proposed some grandiose solutions Â– read my posts again and you will see that I have proposed no solutions, grandiose or otherwise.  So far I have not even gotten to identifying what to fix yet Â– thanks to the current direction of this argument, we cannot yet get to that point.</strong></blockquote><br><br>Then we better, after all picking out problems without providing solutions is not constructive at all, but I urge you to actually know how the air force currently works before you propose any solutions.<br><br>[At this present point in time, I donÂ’t have any interest in your sweeping plans of how to fix the problem.  The issue here is simple Â– you said that they weed out all poor pilots and I disagreed with the two examples I presented, so why donÂ’t we just stick to that?  Your helicopterÂ’s flying all over the place, so your view is of little relevance to my point.<br><br><blockquote><strong>By the way, donÂ’t go embarrassing yourself trying to tell me about numbers.  My doctorate thesis was in statistical analysis, and of all people I know how numbers can be controlled to present a distorted version of the truth.  That is the importance of the disproof that I mentioned earlier Â– if the numbers contradict what you actually know from experience, betting odds are that the numbers are wrong. </strong></blockquote><br><br>So what are the numbers currently telling you? That it is unsafe to operate with our air force? Does striking a lottery (having a bad jump) betting odds are the conclusion, that it is unlikely to win the lottery wrong?<br><br><blockquote><strong>With your example of crossing the road, I accept Â“most and Â“usualÂ” enough to take my chances crossing the road.  However, I am not as foolish as to use those numbers to propose that the driving test process weeds out all bad drivers.</strong></blockquote><strong>[b]<br><br>I never claimed that the RSAF selection system weeded out <span style="font-style: italic;">all</span> the bad drivers. But enough to have all bad things that happen in which our first instict is to blame the pilot be given a second, or even third look before we sic it on the pilot.<br><br>But since you have a doctorate in statistical analysis, I think you can agree with the proposition that having more information makes your conclusion more precise.<br><br>Strange that having a doctorate in statistical analysis, you are not alien to the idea of a zero percent error rate due to pilot failure... what exactly are you seeing in the numbers that I am missing.<br><br>In which case, what you assume to be problems that can be simply fingered towards pilot laxness or attitude problems, can be attributed to far many other factors, once you have all the data.<br><br>I have never proposed that the selection system weeded out all the idiots, but I propose the idea that it weeds out enough of the idiots that most of the bad incidents that do happen are more likely to be a combination of other factors that do not have to always to with pilot incompetence or laxness.<br><br><blockquote>[b]With the rope incident, the very simple SOP of checking with the despatchers for an all-clear before pulling the release lever was already in place, and was violated by the pilot.  In the case of my jump, the pilot violated the 115 knot limit stipulated in the TSR.  IÂ’d classify these as unnecessary risks.</blockquote></strong><br><br>I have no argument with the rope incident, the pilot got what he deserved. And not waiting for the all clear before releasing the rope is not just unnecessary, it is contray to common sense. So hence, this is a violation that I am not even trying to justify.<br><br>In the case of your jump, there is not enough data to suggest what really happened, but suffice to say, is the pilot's attitute really the factor contributing to tis snafu? If it is, he will have a lot to say once he touches down on the tarmac, and it's likely there'll be bad consquences on his wings if he had been found guilty of any wrongful doing or unnecessary risk. After all, jumping from an aircraft is hardly anything to be played around with.<br><br>Also given all the amazing stories I have been hearing about roller coaster rides, there are several conclusions:<br><br>Either the air force is not serious about its policies, and the whole thing is just a wayang. In which case we are doomed. And also unlikely as tons of serious accidents prehaps even more imfamous then the P.O.W training case would have happened by now. How do you cover up one entire stick of jumpers pancaking from reckless flying?<br><br>The pilots are knowingly violating the rules to applease their egos  and then covering their butts (unlikely, considering that any compliant from your co. on their flying can get them canned)<br><br>Or our grunts are seeing things they are not supposed to see, like evil, showoff pilots because of inherent nervousness in a loud, heavy machine held up by nothing but several rotating blades flying at over 100 kph through the air.<br><br>Of course, I'm not even sure when your jump happened, if it did back then before the RSAF started it's current pro-safety policy to cut any kinds of operational snafu that may arise from human error by any means pratical, then it is hardly valid for judging the force now.</div>

That's why I am very interested in finding out the real underlying reason and getting to that rather then blame the pilot all the time. If it's the pilot, go get him, but if there are many other factors to fix, let's work on that first!<br><br>That's the problem of war you see, it is inherently a very dangerous affair. As long as there are munitions flying around, it is impossible for the people near by to be 100 percent safe. In a highly fluid situtation where enemy and friendlies are everywhere, it becomes even more dangerous, there's no denying it.<br><br>As much as we would like to automatically have safe and reliable CAS, which I'm sure the pilots try their best to give, effective CAS is heavily dependent on having up-to-date information, proper communication, and good intelligence, especially when there are no strict lines to be drawn in the battlefield. If we are lacking in any of these areas in any one time, there is a very real risk a bomb will fall on us. This is the nature of war.<br><br>To good news is, if we establish these things properly, CAS is a very effective and safe thing to be around. Hence the onus is on us to make sure that we identify ourselves clearly to our side, and make sure everybody KNOWS were we are currently, as well as have all the proper equipment to prevent misidentification. We cannot rely on the pilot, who is trapped up in his jet at 200 knots who barely has a few seconds to see and figure out everything from a visual picture of dull blotches and dust trials, to work on poor intelligence and directions and expect him to still bomb the right things. In the same way we respect our firearm safety rules, the rules of calling down CAS must also be obeyed carefully, or else accidents will happen.<br><br>It's as basic as not trying to signal to friendly aircraft during combat with a signal mirror as the pilot might mistake the glare for gunfire and engage! We on the ground must make every attempt to make the job for the pilot as easy as possible as he does the same as us. If we have done everything we can and still get bombed... then let's tear him limb from limb.<br><br>CAS aside, if you have a Spector Gunship up there, you can see how the need to communicate proper and precise instructions to them and not rely on the aircrew to figure out things from what they can see becomes immediately apparent!<br><br>Proper air ground communication made the Little Bird strafing runs highly effective in the Battle of the Black Sea, imagine what would have happened if the infantry just told the pilots to "yeah strafe that area on the left intersection (whose left?)" instead of using infrared strobes or other means to mark the Somali positions, which were in some cases just across the street from them with no margin of error.<br><br>Of course, seeing a convoy in a staight line to a pilot may mean anything, it could be friendlies, or a convoy of Iraqi irregulars on technicals heading to engage vastly outnumbered friendly forces. And given how lacking the Iraqis are in proper manuver, anything is to be expected from them. That's why the pilot radioed back to the ground controller what he was seeing, unfortunately the ground controller seemed pretty sure in radioing back.<br><br><blockquote><strong>im saying ask again..duh<br>there are suppose to be 2 group of vehicles one teh ground..aint it obvious the pilot only saw one group of vehicles?<br>think...u are the pilot i saw only one group vehicles? n its in a straight line...whats in your mind now? </strong></blockquote>Well what's on my mind is that the pilot hardly had time to make sense of this up in the air approaching at high speed, expecially that of a fluid situtation. As I said, the Iraqis as an enemy are highly irregular in their tatics and anything, professional or tatically poor, is to be expected from them.<br><br>Sadly, it is impossible for the pilot to actually see anything, especially in a rapidly developing combat situtation. That's why they are dependent on ground operators. In the time they recieved the fire mission and reach the target area, the groups could have merged, split up, or done something else funny. In modern combat, espeically in CAS intelligence, 2 minute intelligence is old news liao.<br><br>I mean we can sit back and relax and think about what went wrong and how this and that should or should not have happened and what should have been done, but understand that in combat such retrospective thinking is next to impossible and usually we have to rely on the simplest methods to get the job done. There's little time to think about why the target doesn't exactly fit the information given, and less to think about given the info was vague and the situtation is fluid.<br><br>That's why the onus remains on us again to guide them unerringly to the target. If we give them the go ahead, they will do it... it is as important for them as it is for us.<br><br>The funny thing about modern warfare technology is that it has little problem hitting targets, but finding the right targets all the time still remains a problem, and will become worse as the ability to kill improves.<br><br>It's all about communication, not pilot competence... unless the pilot was stone dumb.<br><br>Remember this is not a problem that is just going to go away especially when UCAVs come on the scene, operated by an operator that sees out of it's narrow sensors and worse, if some of them are automated. Robots do not question much at all, and the bulk of the burdern in preventing FF will then fall even more on us!<br><br>That's why we should not look down on the signals corps, we need promising talent there man.<br><br><blockquote><strong>its either u forgot whats u type or something else..im refering to this--&gt;<br><br>quote:<br>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>In air combat, the rule of the thumb is, a target does not respond to electronic IFF is to shoot first and ask questions later.

And should you agree with Nathan, it's good to note that while you have been bushwacking, people have been making good progress in understanding the issue and relations between accidents and personnel quality.
