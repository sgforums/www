            <div class='col-md body'>from wikipidia:<br><br>Electronic warfare (EW) is the use of the electromagnetic spectrum to effectively deny the use of this medium by an adversary, while optimizing its use by friendly forces. Electronic warfare has three main components: electronic support, electronic attack, and electronic protection.<br><br>Electronic support (ES) is the passive use of the electromagnetic spectrum to gain intelligence about other parties on the battlefield in order to find, identify, locate and intercept potential threats or targets. This intelligence, known as ELINT, might be used directly by fire-control systems for artillery or air strike orders, for mobilization of friendly forces to a specific location or objective on the battlefield, or as the basis of electronic attack or electronic protection actions.<br><br>Because ES is conducted passively, it can be performed without the target observing any electronic activities. ES's strategic counterpart, SIGINT, is continuously performed by most of the world's countries in order to gain intelligence derived from other parties' electronic equipment and tactics.<br><br>An older term for ES is electronic support measures (ESM).<br><br>Electronic attack (EA) is the active or passive use of the electromagnetic spectrum to deny its use by an adversary.<br><br>Active EA includes such activities as jamming, deception, active cancellation, and EMP use.<br>Passive EA includes such activities as the use of chaff, towed decoys, balloons, radar reflectors, winged decoys, and stealth.<br>EA operations can be detected by an adversary due to their active transmissions. Many modern EA techniques are considered to be highly classified.<br><br>An older term for EA is electronic countermeasures (ECM).<br><br>Electronic protection (EP) includes all activities related to making enemy EA activities less successful by means of protecting friendly personnel, facilities, equipment or objectives. EP can also be implemented to prevent friendly forces from being affected by their own EA.<br><br>Active EP includes such activities as technical modifications to radio equipment (such as frequency-hopping spread spectrum).<br>Passive EP includes such activities as the education of operators (enforcing strict discipline) and modified battlefield tactics or operations.<br>Older terms for EP include electronic protective measures (EPM) and electronic counter countermeasures (ECCM).<br><br>******************<br><br>following the retirement of EF111 Raven, the USAF is using the EA-6B in joint operations with the Navy to close the suddenly-critical electronic warfare gap.<br>Other newer development is an electronic attack version of the F/A-18F, the EA-18G Growler which will in turn replace the Navy's EA-6B Prowler. An F/A-18F "F-1" was re-fitted with ALQ-99 electronic-warfare system...<br><br>SGP seems to have quite complete range of fighters but no EW planes. Is there a need for us to have such planes?</div>

Landing EW aircraft in a foreign but friendly country has its risk, and IMO, thats why they reserved EW aircraft for the Navy.  The USAF no longer has a dedicated EF/ EA aircraft.<br><br>EA-18Gs are protected as High Value assets, so it really isn't much of a risk.<br><br>With UAVs coming in, its true that EW can be unmanned.  I think the only thing limiting it is the power-source required for sustained jamming.</div>

F-18G obviously carrying a lot of sensitive EW data may not be available for export.<br><br>Aussies purchased 24 F-18Fs for a hefty 6 billion( 5.2b USD) A$, the EW version of super bug will be only much more expensive.<br></div>
