              <p>would you think if it would be feasible for f-14s and 18s to be
              complementing? ( dont mind the fatigue) ...  sort of like the
              f-15 and 16 combination liddat, Heavy-light combo</p>

              <p>They used to have it, now they replaced it, with a F-18 C/D, F-18 E/F combo. Before the F-35 comes, 95% of the deck of their carriers will be Hornets or superhornets, since the F-18G will replace the E/A-6B, and the F-18F can already replace their K/A-6. They end up with a mix of F-18 Hornet/C-2 Greyhound airframes, which, I guess, would help with the insane maintainence situation.</p>

              <p>Anyway there was a documentary on the decommissioning of the F-14s...some of them are being stored in a desert facility to be recalled into active service at short notice if required.The rest are taken apart for their parts and those parts go back into US inventory in case Iran wants them illegally for their cannot-fire Tomcats...</p>

              <p><br>i read the book at the book shop...quite expensive</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>oh boy ...after the tom cat decomm...there were hundreds of attemp by middle man to buy Tomcat parts...for iranian.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>after reading the book youd be surprise that the F14 can fire all their weapon and use all their system.....after all the american only manage to sabotage 18 Pheonix only...the rest were operational.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>also the american didnt destroy the huge pile of tomcats parts the iranian held (just not enough time) what they did is they destroy the inventory list of the spare parts....it takes Iranian 20 years to figure out which is which.</p>

              <p>Although the planar nature of the F-14s midbody is interesting (it provides 72% of the lift at Mach 2 for example), the assertion that this is special and allows for greater maneuverability seems to be flawed to me.</p>
              <p>Firstly, all aircraft to some extent are able to generate lift from their fuselage-- the F-15 for example, while having a conventional layout for a fighter jet, is able to fly and land on only 1 wing-- indicating that the fuselage lift is very significant as well.</p>
              <p>Next, the nosecone and cockpit of a fighter jet disrupt the airflow over the fuselage-- at high angles of attack, the fuselage would 'stall' before the wings 'stalled' --thus fuselage lift cannot be a contributor to low speed maneuverability.</p>
              <p>Finally, the distribution of mass over a greater transverse plane (i.e. the aircraft being wider) actually increases the angular inertia of the aircraft-- thus for a given wingspan it would be harder for the aircraft to roll. IIRC, the F-14 was designed as an interceptor, not an air superiority fighter, so linear velocity and stability for weapons launch would be prioritised over maneuverability.</p>
              <p>The F-14 was a unique airplane but let's not make it out to be what it clearly is not. It was designed for long range defence against Russian bombers, not dogfighting with fighters.</p>

              <p>Oh, Bank angle... Erm... Is there anyway to link the full article about this?</p>
              <p>Cos from what I understand, the F-14 can bank more than 60 degrees... I mean, all combat aircraft, interceptors, fighters can roll and achieve level turning flight even at 90 degrees bank.   So normally, we talk about the angles that an aircraft can fly at, its usually referring to the AoA, the angle of attack ie: How far the nose can deviate from its flight path without stalling the wing.</p>
              <p>The F-14 is still a potent dogfighter despite its size.  Its definitely no slug when going up close and personal.  Of course, it would fight with a different approach as opposed to an F/A-18C.  Like how the P-51 would have a different dogfight style as opposed to a Spitfire.</p>
              <p>The F-14 as mentioned, is a fleet interceptor.  I think one of its best capabilities is really climbing high and fast.  Once it gets up at high alt and airspeed, its able to launch the Phoenixes over unbelievable distances. Definitely a shame to see it out of service.</p>

            <div class='col-md body'><p>Heh, I figured the Spitfire and P-51 was good enough.  The Spitfire was an excellent turning fighter.  The P-51 OTOH, was a great energy management fighter.  It couldn't compete in a turning fight, but its able to zoom away, regain energy quicker and turn in for another slashing attack.</p></div>

              <p><br>60 degrees, level, straight flight. Article I no have. But I have a book that was made in the late 70's, where the F-14 and F-15 were fairly new, and the F-16s were starting to emerge as the number 1 light multi-role star. F-18s have yet to enter service. In fact the book includes the A-18, as a separate airframe.</p>

              <p>I see, interesting.  I'm not sure if any jet today can fly level at 60 degrees bank angle without gravity induced yaw, assuming no pilot inputs to correct.</p>
              <p>For tomcat fans, this is a great Tomcat site.  Enjoy.</p>
