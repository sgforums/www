The aircraft, which cost about Â£43 million each, could even be sold off at a loss if a country bids for a large number of them. Other countries on a list of potential purchasers include Norway and South Korea.</strong><br><br>Austria has agreed to purchase 18 aircraft, while Greece, which had said it was interested in buying 60 British Eurofighters, has deferred a decision on the final contract until after the Olympic Games.<br><br>The Government had agreed to buy its Eurofighters in three separate packages of 55, 88 and 89, over the next 10 years as part of a joint project with Germany, Italy and Spain.<br><br>The RAF has already taken delivery of six of the aircraft, which are being used to train pilots. The arrival of the remaining 49 from the first tranche will be delayed, however, if required by other countries.<br><br>Although senior RAF officers have tried to argue that the full complement of 232 aircraft is essential for the security of Britain, the heads of the Army and the Royal Navy have convinced the Government that the money could be better used on more relevant defence projects.<br><br>The decision to sell off some of Britain's Eurofighters was disclosed by Adam Ingram, the Armed Forces minister, in a reply to a parliamentary question by Norman Lamb, a Liberal Democrat MP.<br><br>Mr Ingram said: "Some consideration has been given to the scope to provide for early export of Eurofighter to potential overseas customers.<br><br>"If pursued, a sale might be accomplished by adjusting the delivery profile to the RAF. The RAF remains, however, the primary customer for these aircraft and any decision made will take full account of its requirements."<br><br>Paul Keetch, the defence spokesman for the Liberal Democrats, said: "If other countries get their hands on Eurofighter it will be a blow to our pilots who have been waiting for this plane for years.<br><br>"The fact that the Ministry of Defence is trying to sell off planes ordered for the RAF might make financial sense, but it is a damning indictment of government procurement strategy."<br><br>The embarrassing revelation comes just days after it emerged that the Eurofighter's test pilots had been told to avoid flying through clouds because computer problems risked throwing the aircraft into a "catastrophic spin".<br><br>In a leaked report by a test pilot it emerged that the computer had a tendency to switch from flight mode to ground mode while still in the air.<br><br>Eurofighter was originally conceived 30 years ago to attack formations of Soviet bombers attempting to penetrate Western airspace before a full-scale invasion of Europe.<br><br>When the threat of invasion disappeared with the collapse of the Soviet Union, the aircraft was remodelled to become a multi-role aircraft. The project has since been beset with a succession of problems, which have delayed the arrival of the aircraft and pushed up the cost.<br><br>Two weeks ago, Mr Ingram was also forced to admit that the separate Â£25 billion Joint Strike Fighter project was also facing serious difficulties after it emerged that the aircraft, which is due to replace the Harrier jump jet, was more than 3,000lb too heavy to fly safely.<br><br>A Ministry of Defence spokesman confirmed that the Government was examining a deal that would see Eurofighters delivered to the Austrian air force before being delivered to the RAF.<br><br>All Eurofighters were recently grounded because of problems with landing gear and brakes - a problem described by the manufacturers, British AerospaceSystems, as "teething troubles".<br><br>In 2002, during a test flight, a Spanish Eurofighter crashed after both of its engines failed. Both crew ejected and survived.<br></div>

The paper also named Singapore, Norway and South Korea among potential buyers.<br><br>However, the spokesman said that the ministry was still committed to taking the same total number of aircraft.<br><br>"Examining the delivery rate is not the same as reconsidering the quantity of aircraft.

Also the JSF is too far away for delievery.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>CLARIFICATION OF ERRONEOUS MEDIA REPORTS ON SELECTION OF NEXT GENERATION FIGHTER<br><br>We refer to the reports, Â‘Eurofighters headed hereÂ’ by STREATS (page 8, 31 May 2004) and Â‘UK will be selling 50 Eurofighters to Austria and SingaporeÂ’ by Zao Bao (page 19, 31 May 2004).<br><br>Both reports said that Singapore had agreed to buy an unspecified number of the UKÂ’s Eurofighter aircraft. The reports are erroneous. The three shortlisted candidates for our Next Generation Fighter Programme Â– the F-15T, Rafale and Eurofighter Â– are still undergoing flight trials and technical evaluation.  A decision is not likely until next year.<br><br><a href="http://www.mindef.gov.sg/display.asp?number=2109" rel="nofollow">http://www.mindef.gov.sg/display.asp?number=2109</a></div>
