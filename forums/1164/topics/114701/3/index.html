            <div class='col-md body'>Firstly, I would like to say I'm not taking either Heng or Freddy's side. I think Freddy is a little bit too agressive.<br><br>But Heng's position is highly problematic. Initially this was not about Singapore at all, but Israel. And Heng had to say something negative about SAF?<br><br>So what's some stupid talk in a JC? What bigshot? Would they send a bigshot to JC to talk?? I studied in SIngapore all the way to a master's degree, and never seen "top brass". What's a f$$king JC? So what if some officer said some stupid stuff. You must understand that this guy just go there to do his job, which is pretty boring.<br><br>But would any of Singapore's leaders say anything stupid like "our armed forces are so strong, they can march into KL in one week"?<br><br>It is the Malaysian leaders who once in a while say pretty bad things about Singapore.<br><br>And I've served my 2 and a half years too. I've met real people in the forces, and most of them don't think SAF is super strong.<br><br>But is it true we are stronger than Malaysia militarily? Yes!<br><br>In a war, can we conquer the whole of West Malaysia? No!<br>And that is never the intention!<br><br>Are the officers in SAF arrogant? Not for most of the folks, although SOME may be arrogant.<br><br>In any large organisation, you're bound to have some who are stupid or arrogant.<br><br>But Heng's response was unnecessarily negative, and in the first place, what happened in a JC talk is utterly insignificant.<br><br>Would that one officer at the talk be representative of SAF as a whole? I think not. I have friends who are regulars, and they certainly don't think along the lines of "we can take KL in two weeks".<br><br>Come on, as singaporeans living in Singapore, surely you guys know what it is like over here. That most regulars don't think too highly of the SAF.<br><br>Our military leaders underestimating Malaysia or Indonesia? Unlikely.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>The First Zionist Congress met in Basle, Switzerland, to discuss the ideas set out in Theodor Herzl's 1896 book Der Judenstaat (The Jewish State). Herzl, a Jewish journalist and writer living in Vienna, wanted Jews to have their own state - primarily as a response to European anti-Semitism.<br><br>The Congress issued the Basle Programme to establish a "home for the Jewish people in Palestine secured by public law" and set up the World Zionist Organisation to work for that end.<br><br>A few Zionist immigrants had already started arriving in the area before 1897. By 1903 there were some 25,000 of them, mostly from Eastern Europe. They lived alongside about half a million Arab residents in what was then part of the Turkish Ottoman Empire. A second wave of about 40,000 immigrants arrived in the region between 1904 and 1914.<br><br>At the time of World War I the area was ruled by the Turkish Ottoman empire. Turkish control ended when Arab forces backed by Britain drove out the Ottomans.<br><br>Britain occupied the region at the end of the war in 1918 and was assigned as the mandatory power by the League of Nations on 25 April 1920.<br><br>During this period of change, three key pledges were made.<br><br>In 1916 the British Commissioner in Egypt, Sir Henry McMahon, had promised the Arab leadership post-war independence for former Ottoman Arab provinces.<br><br>However, at the same time, the secret Sykes-Picot Agreement between war victors, Britain and France, divided the region under their joint control.<br><br>Then in 1917, the British Foreign Minister Arthur Balfour committed Britain to work towards "the establishment in Palestine of a national home for the Jewish people", in a letter to leading Zionist Lord Rothschild. It became known as the Balfour Declaration.<br><br>The Zionist project of the 1920s and 1930s saw hundreds of thousands of Jews emigrating to British Mandate Palestine, provoking unrest in the Arab community.<br><br>In 1922, a British census showed the Jewish population had risen to about 11% of Palestine's 750,000 inhabitants. More than 300,000 immigrants arrived in the next 15 years.<br><br>Zionist-Arab antagonism boiled over into violent clashes in August 1929 when 133 Jews were killed by Palestinians and 110 Palestinians died at the hands of the British police.<br><br>Arab discontent again exploded into widespread civil disobedience during a general strike in 1936. By this time, the militant Zionist group Irgun Zvai Leumi was orchestrating attacks on Palestinian and British targets with the aim of "liberating" Palestine and Transjordan (modern-day Jordan) by force.<br><br>In July 1937, Britain, in a Royal Commission headed by former Secretary of State for India, Lord Peel, recommended partitioning the land into a Jewish state (about a third of British Mandate Palestine, including Galilee and the coastal plain) and an Arab one.<br><br>Palestinian and Arab representatives rejected this and demanded an end to immigration and the safeguarding of a single unified state with protection of minority rights. Violent opposition continued until 1938 when it was crushed with reinforcements from the UK.<br><br>Britain, which had ruled Palestine since 1920, handed over responsibility for solving the Zionist-Arab problem to the UN in 1947.<br><br>The territory was plagued with chronic unrest pitting native Arabs against Jewish immigrants (who now made up about a third the population, owning about 6% of the land). The situation had become more critical with the displacement of hundreds of thousands of Jews fleeing the Nazi persecution in Europe. Some six million Jews were killed in the Holocaust during World War II.<br><br>The UN set up a special committee which recommended splitting the territory into separate Jewish and Palestinian states. Palestinian representatives, known as the Arab Higher Committee, rejected the proposal; their counterparts in the Jewish Agency accepted it.<br><br>The partition plan gave 56.47% of Palestine to the Jewish state and 43.53% to the Arab state, with an international enclave around Jerusalem. On 29 November 1947, 33 countries of the UN General Assembly voted for partition, 13 voted against and 10 abstained. The plan, which was rejected by the Palestinians, was never implemented.<br><br>Britain announced its intention to terminate its Palestine mandate on 15 May 1948 but hostilities broke out before the date arrived.<br><br>The death of British soldiers in the conflict made the continuing presence in Palestine deeply unpopular in Britain. In addition, the British resented American pressure to allow in more Jewish refugees - a sign of growing US suport for Zionism.<br><br>Both Arab and Jewish sides prepared for the coming confrontation by mobilising forces. The first "clearing" operations were conducted against Palestinian villages by Jewish forces in December.<br><br>The State of Israel, the first Jewish state for nearly 2,000 years, was proclaimed at 1600 on 14 May 1948 in Tel Aviv. The declaration came into effect the following day as the last British troops withdrew. Palestinians remember 15 May as "al-Nakba", or the Catastrophe.<br><br>The year had begun with Jewish and Arab armies each staging attacks on territory held by the other side. Jewish forces, backed by the Irgun and Lehi militant groups made more progress, seizing areas alloted to the Jewish state but also conquering substantial territories allocated for the Palestinian one.<br><br>Irgun and Lehi massacred scores of inhabitants of the village of Deir Yassin near Jerusalem on 9 April. Word of the massacre spread terror among Palestinians and hundreds of thousands fled to Lebanon, Egypt and the area now known as the West Bank.<br><br>The Jewish armies were victorious in the Negev, Galilee, West Jerusalem and much of the coastal plain.<br><br>The day after the state of Israel was declared five Arab armies from Jordan, Egypt, Lebanon, Syria and Iraq immediately invaded Israel but were repulsed, and the Israeli army crushed pockets of resistance. Armistices established Israel's borders on the frontier of most of the earlier British Mandate Palestine.<br><br>Egypt kept the Gaza Strip while Jordan annexed the area around East Jerusalem and the land now known as the West Bank. These territories made up about 25% of the total area of British Mandate Palestine.<br><br>Since 1948 there had been fierce competition between neighbouring states to lead an Arab response to the creation of Israel. That left the Palestinians as passive onlookers.<br><br>In January 1964, Arab governments - wanting to create a Palestinian organisation that would remain essentially under their control - voted to create a body called the Palestine Liberation Organisation (PLO).<br><br>But the Palestinians wanted a genuinely independent body, and that was the goal of Yasser Arafat who took over the chairmanship of the PLO in 1969. His Fatah organisation (founded in secret five years earlier) was gaining notoriety with its armed operations against Israel.<br><br>Fatah fighters inflicted heavy casualties on Israeli troops at Karameh in Jordan in 1968.<br><br>Mounting tensions between Israel and its Arab neighbours culminated in six days of hostilities starting on 5 June 1967 and ending on 11 June - six days which changed the face of the Middle East conflict.<br><br>Israel seized Gaza and the Sinai from Egypt in the south and the Golan Heights from Syria in the north. It also pushed Jordanian forces out of the West Bank and East Jerusalem.<br><br>Egypt's powerful air force was put out of action on the first day of fighting when Israeli jets bombed it on the ground in a pre-emptive strike.<br><br>The territorial gains doubled the area of land controlled by Israel. The victory heralded a new age of confidence and optimism for Israel and its supporters.<br><br>The UN issued Security Council Resolution 242, stressing "the inadmissibility of the acquisition of territory by war" and calling for "withdrawal of Israeli armed forces from territories occupied in the recent conflict".<br><br>According ot the UN, the conflict displaced another 500,000 Palestinians who fled to Egypt, Syria, Lebanon and Jordan.<br><br>Unable to regain the territory they had lost in 1967 by diplomatic means, Egypt and Syria launched major offensives against Israel on the Jewish festival of the Day of Atonement or Yom Kippur. The clashes are also known as the Ramadan war.<br><br>Initially, Egypt and Syria made advances in Sinai and the Golan Heights. These were reversed after three weeks of fighting. Israel eventually made gains beyond the 1967 ceasefire lines.<br><br>Israeli forces pushed on into Syria beyond the Golan Heights, though they later gave up some of these gains. In Egypt, Israeli forces regained territory and advanced to the western side of the Suez Canal.<br><br>The United States, the Soviet Union and the United Nations all made diplomatic interventions to bring about ceasefire agreements between the combatants.<br><br>Egypt and Syria jointly lost an estimated 8,500 soldiers in the fighting, while Israel lost about 6,000.<br><br>The war left Israel more dependent on the US for military, diplomatic and economic support. Soon after the war, Saudi Arabia led a petroleum embargo against states that supported Israel. The embargo, which caused a steep rises in petrol prices and fuel shortages across the world, lasted until March 1974. In October 1973 the UN Security Council passed resolution 338 which called for the combatants "to cease all firing and terminate all military activity immediately... [and start] negotiations between the parties concerned under appropriate auspices aimed at establishing a just and durable peace in the Middle East".</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>According to the book "The Yom Kippur War : The Epic Encounter That Transformed the Middle East" by abraham rabinovich (i think he's a freelance correspondent for straits times too) the aim of the war was actually not to annihilate israel but to avenge the humiliation of arab defeat during the six-day war.<br><br>The overall strategy was limited - simply seize back the land that was lost during the previous war - same for the syrians who lost the golan heights. While they did achieved complete surprise - the arab armies failed to maintain momentum and hence did not follow thru' their success. There was evident lack of planning as to what to do after they got their foot into the door.. and that's just a part of the big picture look.<br><br>Another impt reason why the israelis were able to turn the tide around in the favor was that they had a superb culture of military effectiveness at all levels. In contrast the arab armies suffered from lack of cohesion and lack of initiative. The following insight best sums it up:<br><br>"Leadership may be the greatest weakness of Arab training systems. [A] sergeant first class in the U.S. Army has as much authority as a colonel in an Arab army. . .

            <div class='col-md body'><strong> Overreliance on Technology in Warfare:<br>The Yom Kippur War as a Case Study </strong><br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;"> http://carlisle-www.army.mil/usawc/Parameters/04summer/bolia.htm</span><br><br>This is one good article from US Army College. I've extracted the conclusion of this article:<br><br>One of the imprints of the Yom Kippur War on military history has been the lessons it has provided regarding the danger of relying on technology as a replacement for doctrine, tactics, and training. This has been demonstrated in this article by examining the overreliance on signals intelligenceÂ—which is only as good as the information it intercepts, and ultimately its interpretationÂ— that led to the Israelis being surprised by the attack on 6 October 1973; and by looking at IsraelÂ’s failure to develop a combined-arms doctrine, relying instead on armor and the Israeli Air Force to the exclusion of adequate infantry and artillery, in the face of Arab armies and air forces that had developed such doctrine.<br><br>The article also has pointed out that while the Israelis were able to overcome their deficiencies, they did so only by means that were completely independent of technology: the quality of their leaders, the quality of their troops, and their national spirit. This should not be taken to mean that advancements in technology have no place in warfare. Rather, the interpretation should be that technology must not be allowed to surpass the development of doctrine and tactics to guide its usage, nor hailed to the exclusion of the human element.<br><br>While MINDEF is pursuing 3G SAF, they must be mindful not to repeat other people's mistake.</div>

There were both political and military factors, but undeniably, the later failure of the Arab forces to capitalise on their initial successes during the opening days of the war accounted for a significant part of the Arabs' losses.<br><br>btw, many historians see the Israeli-Arab Wars as a proxy of the Cold War during that time.</div>

Next the Egypt have invest heavily with Sams and anti-tank missiles which create heavily casaulties for  Isreal tanks and planes as they are not prepare for them.<br><br>For the Isreal side, they have the forsight, one general actually just did a run through with commanders on the golan height defence just week before, that why the syrian was check. Isreal was quick to adapt new technology, they quickly got the US to send them countermeasures for their planes and for tanks they quickly do combine arms to make sure the Armour are support by infantries to protect them from portable anti-tanks missiles.<br><br>Isreal once check the advance of the syrain army , quickly was able to diver it forces to halt the egypt army. Then came the crazy egypt advance which see their tanks in huge numbers do crazy advance ( russian tactics ) against isreal tanks which have dug in, under the pounding of the artiliaries, the egyptian infantry was taken out and now their tanks fall mercy to the highly markmanship of the Isreal tanks. This saw the biggest armour clashes since world war 2. Which concept of  - number superior vs better tanks is proven.<br><br>A bold move was to move bridging equippment, to enable the crossing of the canal. Once in place isreal tanks and M113s are able to cross. Sharon the currently Prime minister is the Hero who oversee the this counter thrust across to egypt shore. He was a Marvick, instead of waiting and secure the banks as instructed, he send his tanks and M113s to attack airfields and others. With such good results, that they soon are ask to take out the AA sites, which open up the way for Isreal airforce planes. After that Isreal did a hook behind the whole 3rd egypt army and totally trapped and are force to call for peace.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I am wondering (aloud) if the facination with IDF, conventional warfare and fighting set pieces on open terrian is relevant beyond seminal concerns like character, ability to adapt and survival defence.<br><br>Since 1973, we have seen vicious enthnic conflicts, 9-11 strikes,  and even narco-drug wars, none of which can any basis or relevance be tied back to the 6 day war.<br><br>The landscape (physically, technology and players) has changed beyond recgonition. Even this thread reflect the new realities, had it appeared in 1973 it would be a technical blow by blow analysis instead of the exchange of moral or psychological analysis seen in the latter posts... interesting</div>
