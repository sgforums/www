            <div class='col-md body'>thats a stupid play on words. yes he collapsed. so collapsing after he had been dunked does not bring to mind drowning? how about the other casualties? u mean to say that u really believed that coincidentally it could have been that several people all suddenly collapsed after the dunking and that drowning couldn't have been the actual reason? how come the medics who arrived to bring him to hospital knew he'd drowned?<br>some people here started saying that En Huai might have been unfit hence collapsed. I don't see u defending him from those allegations either. How long does an autopsy take? How long b4 MINDEF finally admitted he drowned? When did I start telling people he'd drowned? I told them just about a week after his collapse was reported in the news.MINDEF took that much longer to do so. YOU? what were you doing? oh wait. u would be risking your job if u had to tell the truth. i see. ok. so now telling the world that SAF lied about his death constitutes as propagating my own agenda. So should I go along with the masses and pretend I was fooled to seem otherwise? HUH? look at the 4 men in court. Now u tell me. ARE they actually directly responsible for his death? which of the 4 actually held En Huai's head underwater? YOU tell me, since u say u know so much. But u'll probably say u're not at liberty to say. why? oh because u'll risk your job!</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>The general feel for most NSFs are, more often then not, that the SAF is mostly a wayang organisation and "f***ed up". But think about it. If the SAF is just wayang, it must be deserving of an oscar award since nothing extraordinarily big has happened since it's foundation, except being called a small red dot that is. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"></div>
