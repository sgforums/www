I'm one of the few BIGWIGs who give talks to JCs on a regular basis and i speak from experience.  How many talks have u attended in NJC?  1,2,3 or 4?  do u even know who is the military head u posed the qn to?  no? well, i guess anyone can say "oh, I spoke to a big shot and he couldn't give me an ans".  So what is it that "they were saying they could do this and that"?<br><br>"the one lesson sg can learn is to never underestimate your enemy" - that's a quote from you.  So, you're now saying that the enemy in your post is a reference to the "israelis underestimating their enemy"? i see. it is so much clearer when you put Israel's enemy in Singapore's context, but i guess only u are smart enuf to figure that one out...  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>btw, r u gonna answer my qns from the first post?</div>
