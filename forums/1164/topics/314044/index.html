              <p><span><strong>Compensation</strong><br><br>Sir,
              on a related matter raised by Dr Ong – the issue of compensation for
              SAF servicemen was raised in Parliament last October. I informed
              Parliament then that MINDEF would carry out a review of the
              compensation issue.<br><br>MINDEF compensates servicemen for death and
              injury sustained due to military service in accordance with the SAF
              Regulations. While the basic compensation provided is based on the
              provisions in the Workmen's Compensation Act, MINDEF also has the
              flexibility to pay up to 30% in additional compensation in cases where
              circumstances merit this. In exceptional circumstances, MINDEF has also
              paid compensation beyond the 30% cap<br><br>The principles that MINDEF
              applies in computing the compensation amount are consistent with the
              legal principles applied by the civil courts in assessing damages for
              injuries and deaths. I am satisfied that MINDEF's current framework is
              essentially adequate to provide fair and reasonable compensation to our
              servicemen<br><br>I have directed MINDEF to formalise these
              arrangements into a framework for compensation. This framework will
              provide greater clarity for decisions on compensation for deaths and
              injuries sustained due to military service, according to the merits of
              each case.<br><br>In addition, I have asked that for the purpose of
              compensation, MINDEF treat Full-time National Servicemen and NSmen on
              par with regular soldiers. This means that for deaths due to service,
              we will also provide a lump-sum pension of a minimum of one year's
              equivalent regular's pay in addition to the compensation.<br><br>Aside
              from compensation, there is also a range of additional benefits, such
              as welfare grants from the SAF Benevolent Fund and a dependants'
              pension depending on the family's financial circumstances. There is
              also a comprehensive group insurance scheme which our soldiers are
              encouraged to take up. It provides coverage of up to $400,000 at
              affordable premiums of $16 per month for every $100,000 of coverage.<br><br>Sir,
              MINDEF knows that no amount of compensation or benefits will alleviate
              the grief or make up for the loss to the serviceman's family. However,
              with these improvements to our compensation framework, we will be in a
              better position to compensate our servicemen's families as fairly as
              possible.</span></p>

              <p>I agree with your first statement, but your second point is factually incorrect, at least for the SAF group insurance that is offered (and in fact is compulsory for soldiers in certain high tempo units)-- the point of the SAF group insurance would be so that SAF personnel would have SOME insurance coverage in case the other insurance companies withdraw benefits like you stated. Of course, if any insurance company publicly withdraws benefits for soldiers just because they are deployed, the public firestorm that follows would probably give that company some bad times.</p>

              <p>You are correct on your point concerning the SAF Group Insurance plan - which I must admit that I have very little details concerning the insurance companies that are offering the special protection plans for the SAF Personnel.</p>
              <p>Most insurance companies have clauses that will exclude certain vocations exposing the insured to extreme dangers - such as parachuting, bomb disposal work, scuba diving, and similar specialist trade.</p>
              <p>The fighter pilots will have to pay an extra high premium for their policies even when the RSAF has an impeccable service record in terms of flight reliability and the number of aircraft failures for the long period of flight operating hours.</p>
              <p>MINDEF should look into a programme that will insure the SAF Personnel that are exposed to harms' way - especially our troops that have ''volunteered'' for UN sanctioned duties in Afghanistan, Iraq, East Timor and any other war zones that are not in the daily headlines.</p>
              <p>MINDEF can make an effort to contribute 0.05 percent from the Defence Budget into a Group Insurance Policy that will provide a similar scheme comparable to the US Veteran Hospital aftercare of injured US Armed Forces Personnel.</p>
              <p>Alternatively, the Singapore National Budget has always boasted the return of billions of Singapore Dollar every year from the annual budget surplus to every Singaporean. The total sum paid out annually can be more effectively applied to pay for a National Insurance Scheme for the <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">complete life time of every Citizen</span></strong> - including members of the SAF.</p>

              <p>The caption is making fun of the plights of the crippled servicemen and it's not wrong to say that it is making a mockery out of them.</p>

              <p>Does anyone know if the NTUC insurance regularly flogged to recruits has a war or terrorism exclusion? Those are fairly common clauses in life insurance and they are there to limit the insurance company's liability IE if some guy blows up an office tower in the name of the IRA/Al Qaeda/Jesus Christ/ the flying spaghetti monster/ etc causing the tower to collapse, killing thousands, the clause stops the insurance companies from being exposed to millions of dollars in payouts. </p>
              <p>It would be the con of the decade if such exclusions apply.</p>
              <p>Anyway, I read a few years ago that the compensation provided by the govt on death of a serviceman is about S$100000. I think that excludes the 1 years salary referenced above.</p>

              <p>Easy i can answer this for you ! As I was injuried and been through the whole shit thing !!!</p>
              <p>"By right" - yes SAF should provide free medical care at hospital for service injuries as long as you need and compension ..... yes SAF does have that benefits .... but also SAF have lots of assholes that is not doing their proper things !!!</p>
              <p>By sad fact it is mostly "by left" for most cases - which units or people try to cover up the incidents ... , mess up the records and paperworks .... and also soldiers not been properly advice on what their true rights in injuries cases. A lot of these injuried soldiers thus never given what they are entitied  &amp; the rest are buried under the pile of paperworks .... which they mostly end will never get anything - unless you are persistent and have the help of some higher forces .... that push things for you.</p>
              <p>Also what they give is cheap - so that why you are suppose to take up extra coverage which is a joke !!! They ask you to serve the nation, but then you have to buy your own extra insurance  !!! - -  "There is also a comprehensive group insurance scheme which our soldiers are encouraged to take up. It provides coverage of up to $400,000 at affordable premiums of $16 per month for every $100,000 of coverage." </p>
