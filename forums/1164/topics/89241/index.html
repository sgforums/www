            <div class='col-md body'>Whether the information posted is in the public domain can be argued both ways. Just becasue someone posts an orbat, TO&amp;E or lists out certain things, activities or units (even in abbrevations) on the net does not make it public.<br><br>In other words you CANNOT repeat data found here on the premises that such information is already public (i.e. not secret). MSD and other "hiao peng yew" can and will haul in those who 'publish' such information which are "Confidential" (nominal list of servicemen, training programs etc) "Restricted" (like training formats etc) and the other higher security classifications.<br><br>I have seen several questionable leaks from this site that I am suprised that the powers that be have not issued a warning yet.  Some are clear violations of OpSec, there is no need to list them here.<br><br>SO TAKE THIS AS A FRIENDLY WARNING "STOP! AND THINK BEFORE YOU POST". Is the slip of the tongue on information which your mother or sister or even your brother not privy to, make you a 'wiser man' by publishing it?<br><br>FYI - the Official Secrets Act reads:<br><br>"section 5. Â—(1) If any person having in his possession or control any secret official code word, countersign or password, or any photograph, drawing, plan, model, article, note, document or information which Â—<br><br>(a) relates to or is used in a prohibited place or anything in such a place;<br><br>(b) relates to munitions of war;<br><br>(c) has been made or obtained in contravention of this Act;<br><br>(d) has been entrusted in confidence to him by any person holding office under the Government; or<br><br>(e) he has obtained, or to which he has had access, owing to his position as a person who holds or has held office under the Government, or as a person who holds, or has held a contract made on behalf of the Government or any specified organisation, or as a person who is or has been employed under a person who holds or has held such an office or contract,<br><br>does any of the following:<br><br>(i) communicates directly or indirectly any such information or thing as aforesaid to any foreign Power other than a foreign Power to whom he is duly authorised to communicate it, or to any person other than a person to whom he is authorised to communicate it or to whom it is his duty to communicate it;<br><br>(ii) uses any such information or thing as aforesaid for the benefit of any foreign Power other than a foreign Power for whose benefit he is authorised to use it, or in any manner prejudicial to the safety or interests of Singapore;<br><br>(iii) retains in his possession or control any such thing as aforesaid when he has no right to retain it, or when it is contrary to his duty to retain it, or fails to comply with all lawful directions issued by lawful authority with regard to the return or disposal thereof; or<br><br>(iv) fails to take reasonable care of, or so conducts himself as to endanger the safety or secrecy of, any such information or thing as aforesaid,<br><br>that person shall be guilty of an offence."<br><br>Don't forget the 'SAF Act', Cap 295 as well as the 'Penal Code', Cap 224 and yes, even the 'Computer Misue Act', Cap 50a (if you lifted the information without permission) can be used to throw the book at the mis-informed.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Sure, some of these information may have been published before, like the orbat in mr huxley's book.  But let me ask u a simple question.  Was the book published by Mindef?<br><br>If mindef is not the publisher, or acknowledged the publication, then it probably means that these information is still NOT considered as public domain!  Next, I did not acknowledge the LEGITMACY of the orbat.  All I am sayings is, DO NOT POST such information here.  Whether its true or not, don't do it!  These information are sensitive for a reason.  We don't want neighbours to get excessively worried when they see such stuff. So rule of thumb, we don't let people know about such things.  Information NOT declassified officially by the SAF remain as official secrets.<br><br>About exercise codenames, true enough, certain high profiles ex. codenames are known to public.  But there are those codenames that are more sensitive.  Don't start a habit of using SAF codenames here, incase some dumb NSF or personnel tat may not know better, start talking about theirs, accidentally revealing other exercise codenames.<br><br>Come on, most of u guys have been thru NS.  U know that this is all serious business...  Speculating and talking about military stuff, sharing experiences are all fine.  But please, leave sensitive information out of it.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Heh.Data mining at work.Guys, if you want to release information that might implicate you or fellow guys in your camp, please do not leave a trail that people can trace back.EX Codenames are alright,but please do not reveal in detail what exactly we do in it.The name is enough because we will know hwat you are trying to say.<br><br>For equipment listing, I think we should not be so ornery and be clamshells.As long as it's classified operational procedures and is not published on the Web.Please do not post.I'm open to information found in books and websites as they are already in the public domain.I disagree with Shotgun here because any person who is interested in such things will have the same access to the data on  those books and websites.I trust that the people who are entrusted with OpSec in MINDEF are smart enough.Ever heard of the honeypot theory?As long as you do not see it in person, it might not be true.So do not be unduly worried but be vigilent too.If you think that someone has posted classified info, PM the MOD and the fellow concerned.See what each has to say, then get the MOD to delete it if necessary. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"></div>

All the honey-pot packages aim to provide a working facade capable of enticing would-be intruders into using the service, and then coaxing them into displaying malicious intent. The extent of emulation offered by the packages varies. see <a href="http://www.networkcomputing.com/1116/1116ws3.html?ls=NCJS_1116bt" rel="nofollow">http://www.networkcomputing.com/1116/1116ws3.html?ls=NCJS_1116bt</a><br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Let me ask you all a question. If someone not from SAF (think of ang-moh) posts the info found in "public domain" (non Mindef-publications, webpages etc), is he innocent?</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I would consider it alright.Can MINDEF trace down the site server and make a big hoo-ha about the information and tells it to shut down?Technically,yes.But it would attract undue attention , so most likely they would leave it be.C'mon, if it's already out there, it's harmless.The onus is on them  , not us.</div>
