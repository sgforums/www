              <p>Agreed... SIA pilots have a really high pay... Get to fly around the world and sit by relax till your next flight... Lots of benefits and SIA sponsors their pilots on their expenses during their working period...</p>

              <p>I wonder as well... Probably due to long periods of working and salary not high enough for em...? Not very sure about RSAF pilot's pay but a senior technician is only $2400++ to $2800++ after working there for 10 years... Zzzz... Starting pay good but after that the pay increments very low...</p>

              <p>Not very likely, unless they hit somewhere near like JB.</p>
              <p>The typical H-bomb of 20MT yield have a lethal radius of roughly 17km, where it will destroy most civillian buildings. At 47km there is only moderate damage, though you have to worry somewhat about the fallout.</p>
              <p>So by most calculations you need at least a two or three overlapping H-Bomb strikes to totally annhilate Singapore, or an oversized bomb like the 50MT Tsar Bomba.</p>
              <p>But seriously if you keep worrying about nuclear war and say there's no need for the SAF since no point, then see what exactly will happen when we really have NO SAF and other nations find this little island a pushover.</p>

              <p>I read with amazement some of the stuff posted here. For a start, while simulator flying is part of the air force training, there is a lot more actual flying than in simulators. Also, if you had been to the Air Force open house recently, you'll probably find that some pilots are of LTA rank and they do fly real aircraft regularly.  On the other hand, in SIA, if you are in the wrong aircraft fleet, you may find yourself visiting the simulator regularly to keep current with take-offs and landings.</p>
              <p>Will post a bit more when more come to mind.</p>

              <p><br>I think I've been around long enough to differentiate between fact and fiction.</p>
              <p>Anyway, flying in the RSAF is not about "flying around the island". How do you think the RSAF conduct bilateral exercises with foreign air forces that deploy here?</p>
              <p>Also, being on standby is part and parcel of any military force and therefore it is something you are expected to do if you join the air force. What good is an air force if every pilot wants to have every weekend and public holiday off? In any case, try asking around any SIA pilots, you will find that only the lucky few will get to spend their X'mas, New Year, Chinese New Year and etc in S'pore.</p>
              <p>Pay wise, I think a newly qualified RSAF pilot's pay is comparable to a newly qualified SIA pilot. The main difference is that the mentioned RSAF pilot is probably 22-23 years old whereas the SIA pilot is about 29 years old at best. To earn big bucks as captain in SIA, you'll have to wait till you are in your late 30's.</p>

              <p>you may not even get to fly the plane more than once a week.</p>
              <p>and the 'extra shit' that people tell you? it's all the paperwork and secondary appointments that suck up your non-flying time. most pilots get farmed out to staff jobs after a few years anyway.</p>
              <p>and the standby? yes indeed it's true. 15 mins from receiving the call to being in the aircraft ready to be take-off? that call can come anywhere anytime. why do you think pilots move so close to their air bases?</p>
              <p>sometimes, you just wear your flight suit, sit in the plane and sweat it out just because something out of the norm happened. then, realising that it's all for nothing, you just get out of your plane, engines left unfired.</p>
              <p>and not all get to be fighter-trained. a substantial number get transport a/c (rumoured that this is more relevant for SIA) and others get helicopters.</p>

              <p>as in all things, there are pros and cons.</p>
              <p>i ask you to consider it carefully, because many people signed on for pilot thinking about the pros but neglecting the cons.</p>

              <p>Lemme just give u an overall picture mate. A pilot in RSAF would have less actual flying hours as compared to a SIA pilot. I wont say exactly how much, but then if u want the flying hours, SIA is the way to go. But if u want hands-on flying instead of auto-piloting most of the flight, the RSAF is the way to go.</p>
              <p>But if u like the commercial sector, with less regimentation, less shit and more pay, more nice women, then u shldnt even be contemplating abt joining RSAF. The air force doesnt pay as well, and the perks and benefits sure as hell dont match up with SIA. Thus most people dont want to go RSAF, but instead join SIA straight the moment they reach 26 yrs old. If not, some take the longer but safer route of joining RSAF and then hopping over to SIA once their 12 yr bond is over. This is the reality man. Dont get ur mind clouded by all the illusions that RSAF has painted for u.</p>
              <p>I'm more or less a military fella, so I'm all for RSAF. But get this straight; not everyone likes this kind of lifestyle. For the people who truly want to become air force pilots, they do not mind the lower pay nor less glam as compared to SIA pilots. They do it cos they like it. Sad thing is that most people who go over end up not liking it. I'm kinda thinking that KiraYamato and u, Pablo, are people like that.</p>
              <p>If u have ever been in a uniformed group back in ur sec sch days, as in either ncc or npcc (the others are gay), then u shld noe whether a regimental lifestyle is one for u. Its not exactly the same type of life, but then u get the message.</p>
