              <p>I think what's important for the TS is to calibrate his expectations on being a pilot in the RSAF.</p>
              <p>First and foremost, he will be an officer. Being an officer, he is expected to pick up paperwork, projects and what have you. It is the same with any vocations in the army, navy or air force. Almost every SAF officer will serve some time on staff job and this is part of requirement for advancement. However, in the initial few years as a pilot in the air force, you'll find that most of the time is spent on building up his operational capabilities. After achieving certain level of ops status, he will then be expected to take up secondary duties like officers in any other vocation/service. Do you think a regular artillery officer only fire shells everyday?</p>
              <p>Therefore, being a RSAF pilot is about being both a combatant and an officer. So, if the TS just want to fly fighter and overlook his duties as an officer, then this job is not for him.</p>

              <p>Lemme just give u an overall picture mate. A pilot in RSAF would have less actual flying hours as compared to a SIA pilot. I wont say exactly how much, but then if u want the flying hours, SIA is the way to go. But if u want hands-on flying instead of auto-piloting most of the flight, the RSAF is the way to go.</p>
              <p>But if u like the commercial sector, with less regimentation, less shit and more pay, more nice women, then u shldnt even be contemplating abt joining RSAF. The air force doesnt pay as well, and the perks and benefits sure as hell dont match up with SIA. Thus most people dont want to go RSAF, but instead join SIA straight the moment they reach 26 yrs old. If not, some take the longer but safer route of joining RSAF and then hopping over to SIA once their 12 yr bond is over. This is the reality man. Dont get ur mind clouded by all the illusions that RSAF has painted for u.</p>
              <p>I'm more or less a military fella, so I'm all for RSAF. But get this straight; not everyone likes this kind of lifestyle. For the people who truly want to become air force pilots, they do not mind the lower pay nor less glam as compared to SIA pilots. They do it cos they like it. Sad thing is that most people who go over end up not liking it. I'm kinda thinking that KiraYamato and u, Pablo, are people like that.</p>
              <p>If u have ever been in a uniformed group back in ur sec sch days, as in either ncc or npcc (the others are gay), then u shld noe whether a regimental lifestyle is one for u. Its not exactly the same type of life, but then u get the message.</p>

              <p>Guess I gotta disappoint you, but I'm not desiring for more pay and stuff as you said... I do know SIA pilots have lots of attractive pay and benefits, but unfortunately I'm not interested being a SIA pilot. A simple reason would be that I'm not intending to pilot a commercial airliner. If at all possible, I hope to be piloting a fighter jet (though it's not something I can make a choice on, therefore wishing lady luck is on my side).</p>
              <p>I'm also fully aware of military lifestyle means you have to report back whenever they call for you, which I dun really mind coz that's how the military trains us to be.</p>

              <p><br>its because lay people on the outside don't know much about the reality about pilot life(pros n cons) and the job requirements and what they actually do so he has to make examples from where the general public can see - i.e open house.</p>
              <p>you'll never really understand or know what goes on at work for a pilot unless you're involved in it. so even a logs or c3 personnel will only see the part of which they interact with pilots and make assumptions of what a pilot's worklife is like which isn't actually the whole truth but more like a certain aspect of it only.</p>
              <p>and really, some of the comments made on the forum raise eyebrows. where do you get your info from?</p>

              <p>Cheeze, good to see you.</p>
              <p>I think we need bust some of the myths running around here before Yamato thinks that the RSAF all crap...though it may be true sometimes. I'll start...</p>
              <p>Pilots do not live near air bases, some may but not all. Who wants to subject themselves to the noise of aircraft taking off at full power? Just ask people who live around Seng Kang and Punggol.</p>
              <p>To be recalled and be ready to take off in 15 min... no way! ... walking from the main gate of any airbase to the squadron already take up more than 15 min. BTW, SIA pilots are also required to be on standby.</p>
              <p>It is unlikely that you will log more flying hour in simulator than actual flying in the RSAF unless you screw up so badly that extra training is required. On the other hand, some SIA pilots need to hop into a simulator to refresh their take-off and landing to be legal to fly because they have no opportunity to do so in real flight.</p>

              <p>About the pay. My gut feel is that pay in RSAF and SIA is about the same if you work till retirement age. Of course the difference is that in RSAF, you retire at 45, while in SIA, you can fly till 62 (need to verify this but I think it's around this figure) provided you are medically fit. If you ask me, I think it's half truth that pay is better in SIA.</p>
              <p>If you make it in RSAF, you will be collecting a decent pay when you graduate at the age of about 22-23. What do you think your counterparts will be doing at this age?Some years down the road, when you feel like a career switch, the SIA option is still open. No one can fault you then for jumping ship because it is your right to the livelihood of your choice. If you don't make it as RSAF pilot, you just ORD like normal NS and start thinking about SIA option in a couple years time.</p>
              <p>As for SIA, you can only join to be pilot after 26. By the time you qualify as co-pilot, you will be close to 30. Meanwhile what do you do? Study? Work? Do you want to spend your next few years risking not being accepted by SIA? If you are fortunate, you may establish a different career before 26 and forgo the idea of commercial flying altogether. If you are unlucky, you may find that the years before had gone wasted with nothing achieved and your dream as "big buck earning" SIA pilot go burst.</p>
              <p>You can hear all the good and bad things about SIA and RSAF, but entry into SIA is just as no guarantee as the RSAF.</p>

              <p><br>Oh... Coz it's kinda weird that Rednano stated that "<span style="color: #ff6600;"><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">u get paid more in SIA than in the rsaf pilot</span></strong></span><span style="color: #000000;">"</span></p>
              <p>Anyways, as I said before... I'm not really into SIA, coz I'm not into commercial airliner... I'm only interested in a military + pilot career... Hope lady luck is on my side...</p>

              <p>nah, pilots don't spend more time in the simulators then flying..</p>

              <p>being a pilot is not only just about flying the plane.</p>
              <p>let's put it in context and we'll just discuss about the fighter pilot aspect.</p>
              <p>for every mission that you do, you definitely have to prepare for it right? i.e the mission planning, mission briefing, coordination and stuff.  the most appropriate person to do it would be the pilots involved and no one else right? and this has to take place on the ground.</p>
              <p>so let's say on average for a 1 hour mission, you have a 1 hour briefing and a 1 hour debriefing. and let's cater time for transits(getting to and back from the jet) maybe 30mins?  and if you have an average of 2 flights a day which is not uncommon because operational squadrons do fly VERY regularly and there's not that many pilots for you to just fly once a week otherwise that would be really ideal. i don't think pilots would mind working less for that same amount of money. you actually would get 2 hours flight time and about 4 hours of time on the ground which is actually true you do spend 70% of the time on the ground but not necessarily doing shit work.</p>
              <p>not to mention that you still have the next days mission planning/ coordination. maybe you might have reports to finish up and all. its all in a day's work.and flight preparation and debrief is time consuming because it has to be thorough to cover all the important aspects of the mission and the lessons learnt. if not, then the pilots would literally be "flying round the island to clock currency" to quote but the truth is that every mission has a learning objective; whether it is to improve your BFM or your bombing accuracy or whatever other missions you are supposed to do. but of course there will be the rare occasion where you have flights dedicated to just basics flying to consolidate the basic flying fundamentals.</p>
              <p>also for those bilateral exercises or those combined exercises that take place, the people organising and planning the operational aspect of it would definitely have to be the pilots and sometimes other related agencies; and this again will take time away from flying.</p>
              <p>and about those other shit stuff like maybe organising events or other stuff. it probably comes with every job. i'm very sure in private sector their own DnD's for example would have to be overseen by probably their junior staff as well? so i guess the amount of shit you actually get is indirectly proportional to how high up you are the ladder?</p>
              <p>weekends/ph getting burnt is part and parcel of the job because its defence of singapore you're talking about. there are no holidays when it comes to this. but of course its not every weekend that you get planned to work (if you do then probably the guy planning it doesn't like you, or there's simply a shortage of manpower which is not impossible). but the good thing is at least most of the time your in country; compared to commercial flying whereby there are totally no Pub Hols/ weekends in the consideration for their planning of pilot rosters, you spend more time away and definitely more weekends burnt.</p>
              <p>so if you weigh the pros n cons of being in the airforce and commercial flying versus what one expects from the job. it wouldn't be difficult to make a choice as to which job is more suitable for each individual's aspirations.</p>
              <p>hopefully this dispels some of the myths and half-truths about worklife of a pilot that's going around in here which is based on alot of assumptions and inferences.</p>

              <p>good luck to your quest to become a pilot and hopefully you don't get jaded along the way.</p>
              <p>work hard towards it and you can experience the things that only those who made it that far can and will understand  because people outside and not in the circle of peole that do the job simply can't comprehend. it'll always be an a view from the outside looking in wondering what it is really like.</p>
              <p>but trust me getting there is all hard work and sweat.</p>
              <p>and also while reading this forum for information its really important for people to make out the ones who are giving genuine advice, and the ones who are bitter and bitten. but really it is important to read and exercise your judgement about all the issues raised as to which are facts or just pure hot air. :)</p>
