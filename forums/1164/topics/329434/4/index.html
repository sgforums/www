              <p><br>yeah i guess there's quite a fair number of pilots who eventually leave after their bond ends, maybe for a career switch to the airlines or some other industry once they felt they've had enough of military flying. i guess its just push and pull factors that decide that.</p>
              <p>however bear in mind that a career switch in the mid-30s coupled with the burden of possiblly supporting a family at that time would also make people stay on just for financial stability's sake.</p>
              <p>there's so many different reasons for people to leave and go but pablo is right that everyone has their right to decide what they want to work as.</p>
              <p>but at least if you're a pilot before and you leave the organisation, you still get to come back and fly quite regularly as a NSman for your reservist obligations. so its not too bad after all if the reason you started flying was just because you wanted to be in a jet.</p>

              <p>It's kinda weird and dumb that I only have interest in being a pilot as a career... In Singapore, it's very difficult to work as one and worse I dun really have the interest on working as other vocations... I pretty much dislike working as a technician/engineer, although they are the ones who hold the safety and success of today's aviation technology &gt;.&lt;</p>
              <p>I do have Plan B and probably C too... I'm intending to go through step by step, I won't think too far, just pray hard that I can make it through before enlistment first. I believe everything has its pros and cons... But still, hope Plan A will succeed ;)</p>

              <p>Erm... I'm very curious about this issue which hasn't seem to be addressed... What are the criteria that MINDEF look upon when grading our medical examination...?</p>

              <p>If you are medically fit, there's no need to worry too much. Besides, somethings are pre-destined, e.g. arm length, torso length, heart condition, etc.</p>
              <p>Given the stringent requirement just to be selected for pilot training, it is no surprise that many do not make it. After the initial selection, it is a long road ahead... you'll be labelled "trainee" for at least 2 years... Also, things will only get tougher downstream, but I hope you will not be intimidated. Wish you all the best.</p>

              <p>It is indeed easier to transit to SIA after ur rsaf contract is up. In fact, if u have served until 47 yrs old (or somewhere there), there is currently a scheme which either pops u over to SIA or CAAS after ur mandatory retirement. Note that this is for pilots only.</p>
              <p>However, if ur only reason to join the air force is so u can transfer over to SIA easily in the future, then I advise u not to do it. U will end up regretting it. The bond in the air force is quite long. If u regret after a few yrs, good luck to u.</p>
              <p>The type of aircraft u fly helps a little bit. Esp if u are flying the KC-135. But its the overall flying experience that accounts for it.</p>

              <p><br>im just wondering about the options after a career with the air force. cos i dont think i'll want to be stuck with an admin job in the air force, and many have said you'll be doing staff jobs after getting a particular operational status, so maybe its better to join sia. So even chopper pilots can transition fairly easily?</p>
              <p>Btw, some here mentioned a 10 yr contract, some mentioned a 12yr contract, so is it 10 or 12? From the time you get your wings right?</p>

              <p><br>even if u get staff jobs you will still be required to fly regularly to maintain your flying proficiency. and your staff tour will probably be around 2 years in duration after which you may have a further staff tour or rotate back into the squadron for active duty.</p>
              <p>but since your vocation is still a pilot, no matter where you are posted to you will still be required to fly- it's just a matter of how often you fly. of course if you're an active pilot in the squadron you'd be logging more flying hours than a staff pilot for sure.</p>
              <p>but a staff tour is essential to any pilot's career or for that any other vocation as it creates a more holistic/macro level appreciation of the organisation's working, planning and doctrinal views. therefore after rotation back into the squadrons for maybe management posts or slighly more senior positions you'd be better able to appreciate what goes around and be equipped to guide the junior guys along.</p>

              <p><br>even if u get staff jobs you will still be required to fly regularly to maintain your flying proficiency. and your staff tour will probably be around 2 years in duration after which you may have a further staff tour or rotate back into the squadron for active duty.</p>
              <p>but since your vocation is still a pilot, no matter where you are posted to you will still be required to fly- it's just a matter of how often you fly. of course if you're an active pilot in the squadron you'd be logging more flying hours than a staff pilot for sure.</p>
              <p>but a staff tour is essential to any pilot's career or for that any other vocation as it creates a more holistic/macro level appreciation of the organisation's working, planning and doctrinal views. therefore after rotation back into the squadrons for maybe management posts or slighly more senior positions you'd be better able to appreciate what goes around and be equipped to guide the junior guys along.</p>

              <p>ok thanks alot. If you do not plan to renew your contract, is it unlikely that you'll be promoted to Major? In that case career advancement would not be much of an issue would it.</p>
              <p> oh btw pilots have to wake up so early too? lol.</p>

              <p><br>im just wondering about the options after a career with the air force. cos i dont think i'll want to be stuck with an admin job in the air force, and many have said you'll be doing staff jobs after getting a particular operational status, so maybe its better to join sia. So even chopper pilots can transition fairly easily?</p>
              <p>Btw, some here mentioned a 10 yr contract, some mentioned a 12yr contract, so is it 10 or 12? From the time you get your wings right?</p>
              <p>thanks</p>

              <p><br>Some of the guys posting here seem to think that staff job is admin job. But staff job is not admin job. As a staff officer, in most cases, you will be involved in planning of operations at RSAF level. It can be as simple as justifying which squadron to be deployed for foreign detachment or as interesting as proposing what new aeroplane to buy. Performance in staff tour may even decide if yo are good enough to become general.</p>
              <p>Anyway, all these are so far down the road. If military flying is for you, just go for it. It is hard enough to decide what to eat for my next meal, what more to think of what's happening to me in 10 years time.</p>
              <p>Also, I don't think there's anymore contract service for officers, it has become something called SAVER. The 10 or 12 year thing is your bond, i.e. you are obligated to serve the time after completion of flying training. Suggest you find out more from the recruitment centre before scribbling on the dotted line.</p>

              <p>the promotion part i would have to say it depends on the individual.</p>
              <p>but compare it to companies on the outside- if you know an employee is leaving. would you want to promote them to entice them to stay or they might still leave/ or reward someother hardworking person who is definitely staying with a promotion. i think you'd have your answer there.</p>
              <p>yeah. we're early birds. haha.</p>

              <p>Nah the contract doesnt end at 35 yrs old. Haha... Lets say u are the typical A Level boy, as in finishing A's at 18, joining at 19. After trng 2 yrs, bond 10 yrs (total 12 yrs), u would be 31 yrs old. U wont be 35 unless u are poly, and then u retain for so many years. lol. The university period is part of the bond, meaning that it runs concurrently with ur bond AFAIK. So part of ur 10 yr bond would be spent studying in university, if u so choose to.</p>
              <p>And btw, kopiosatu is not a pilot. He's a groundcrew. Many people have different opinions about the organisation depending on what they experience while they were in there. Some like it, some dont. </p>

              <p>for the university tingy, its a 6 year bond.. but since it runs concurrently, your degree takes 4 years, you just serve another 2 years..</p>
              <p>they'll pay you your rank pay and pilot pay i think, but no flying allowance and during holidays, you'll be going to hq or somewhere to work as a staff officer.</p>

              <p>OK thanks you guys. Cos i thought that you will have to extend your bond by 4 years to make up for the 4 years you are in university.

              <p>pilot bond is 10 yrs. pilot leaves for studies 5 years into the bond. so he has 5 years left of his pilot bond to serve.</p>
              <p>study bond is 6 years. study period is 4 years (but transparent).</p>

              <p>you have 5 years (pilot bond) + 6 years (study bond) to serve and both run concurrently. so in total. You serve 6 years after your finish your studies.</p>
              <p>the time in university does not count towards your pilot bond, you have to finish it after you study.</p>
