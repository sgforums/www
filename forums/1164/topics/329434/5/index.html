              <p>RSAF Pilots clock comparable flight hours to European Air Force pilots.  And I'm not talking about some Eastern European Air Force.... </p>
              <p>Especially towards the end of the year, the pilots will find themselves flying more often just to make sure they clock the hours required for the year.  </p>
              <p>If you love speed without the ERP gantries and the panoramic view from a fighter cockpit, the RSAF is for you man. </p>
              <p>All the best.  </p>

              <p>PS: I'm gonna suggest they put ERP gantries on the departure end of the air base runways... I mean, why not man?</p>

              <p>Lol. The air force ends up having to pay for it, which means that one part of the govt made to pay to another dept of the govt. haha</p>

              <p>OK thanks you guys. Cos i thought that you will have to extend
              your bond by 4 years to make up for the 4 years you are in
              university. If i were the RSAF i'd make the pilots do
              that LOL. because if not, you'll be "paying back" the university
              sponsorship with just 2 years of service right? i wouldn't think
              its worth it for the RSAF hahaha.</p>

              <p>To me, the concern of being an RSAF pilot is about enjoying what you gonna do and be proud of what you are. Ranks, bond and other issues should be placed at a lower priority or none.</p>
              <p>As mentioned by the others posted here:-</p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;"><strong>Decide properly, weight the pros and cons, and finally what's your true objective?</strong> </span></p>
              <p>It's extremely difficult to be part of RSAF, so many hardships one has to bear... But you quit to join SIA for a more relaxing + more benefits + higher pay job and etc...? No offence, but it feels like you're using RSAF to help you reach to a higher goal... If your true objective is SIA, I sincerely do not think you should join RSAF in the first place...</p>

              <p>i think there's absolutely nothing wrong in transitioning to SIA after being a pilot in the airforce. sometimes its just a change of career goals, lifestyle.</p>

              <p>you've done your part by prob serving out your bond, so there's really nothing wrong in moving on to a "better" option. :P</p>
              <p>anyway the airforce is using your blood and sweat and energy and paying you good returns. what's wrong with using the airforce to get into SIA? its not a sure bet that you'll get accepted into SIA anyway? its a mutual exchange of benefits in my opinion by both employee and employer. :)</p>
              <p>anyway your NS reservist requirements will still be to go back and fly fighters during your SIA offdays what? you're still serving the country. =)</p>

              <p>To me, the concern of being an RSAF pilot is about enjoying what you gonna do and be proud of what you are. Ranks, bond and other issues should be placed at a lower priority or none.</p>
              <p>As mentioned by the others posted here:-</p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;"><strong>Decide properly, weight the pros and cons, and finally what's your true objective?</strong></span></p>
              <p>It's extremely difficult to be part of RSAF, so many hardships one has to bear... But you quit to join SIA for a more relaxing + more benefits + higher pay job and etc...? No offence, but it feels like you're using RSAF to help you reach to a higher goal... If your true objective is SIA, I sincerely do not think you should join RSAF in the first place...</p>

              <p>It's good to have options, and it's good to weigh your options. I'm just trying to find out more about the terms of the contract. You sound like someone who will accept anything in order to fly a jet, even if they do not pay you or make you work 24/7,but not everyone is as motivated as you and a line must be drawn between being idealistic and being pragmatic. Conversely, wanting to find out when the contract ends and considering future options does not amount to a lack of passion, it is being forward looking and prudent. Every servicemen has to leave eventually and maybe for some it's better to leave at 35 when it's easier to start a 2nd career? As cheeze said, it's a mutual exchange of benefits, if you find that you have nothing more to learn/earn/gain/experience, maybe its time for a change in direction. </p>
              <p>Also, I think that transition to SIA is one of the perks/advantages/tools used by the RSAF to recruit new pilots. In fact this is mentioned in one of the pilot recruitment brochure I have. As such I do not think that it is philosophically wrong to have a SIA career through a RSAF career, I'm just contemplating possible future moves that will allow one to fly till 60 hopefully, and this is not something the AF offers.</p>

              <p>I wont put it as simplistic. I'd say its plain childish. And dun get started on me here buddy. I once thought like u. And I'm not that old in case u were wondering. In fact I think we are of the same age.</p>
              <p>I used to think that heck everything, just so long as i can be an air force pilot, I'd fuck everything else in the world. U think that the rank and wateva other pay or shit doesnt matter. Heck yea in NCC this is the case. I dont care whether I'm a cadet lieutenant ot cadet captain. U think that being able to fly is enough. U seem to believe that ur passion in flying is able to keep ur dreams flying high. Guess what? U're wrong. Thinking like this shows that u are only not ready for a career in the military.</p>
              <p>I'm pretty much the same as ya. I'm not contemplating a career in SIA, at least not yet, not while I havent tasted life in the air force yet. My dream is to be a fighter pilot. But unlike u, I work for my dream instead of just sitting here chatting in the forum wondering whether posting more stuff here would get me a better chance at hitting the jackpot. So, 'wake up ur bloody idea', as my seniors used to tell me, and instead work on getting ur results, ur fitness and other vital aspects ready. </p>

              <p>Erm... bloodsucker, I figured you might have misunderstood my words.</p>
              <p>I'm only here to ask for information and the procedures regarding RSAF... The above stated is only a personal comment so I dun think there's any reason for you to take it that seriously.</p>
              <p>Just to clarify with you, <strong>I'm not here to talk big and dream and expect things to happen</strong>, and I'm <strong>WORKING</strong> for it. Although the only thing I can do is training myself and preparing for NS, which I believe most males are/will do the same thing as well.</p>
