When asked to give a few words at a military ceremony Â“Romper Bomper Stomper BooÂ” is probably not appropriate.<br><br>93. Nerve gas is not funny.<br><br>94.

The proper response to a chemical weapon attack is not Â“Tell my chain of command what I really think about them, and then poke holes in their masks.Â”<br><br>99.

            </div>
            <div class='col-md body'>101. I am not allowed to mount a bayonet on a crew-served weapon.<br><br>102. Rodents are not entitled to burial with full military honors, even if they are "casualties of war".<br><br>103. My commander is not old enough to have fought in the civil war, and I should stop implying that he did.<br><br>104. Vodka, green food coloring, and a Â“Cool MintÂ” ListerineÂ® bottle is not a good combination.<br><br>105. I am not allowed to bum cigarettes off of anyone under twelve.<br><br>106. I may not trade my rifle for any of the following: Cigarettes, booze, sexual favors, Kalishnikovs, Soviet Armored vehicles, small children, or bootleg CDÂ’s.<br><br>107.

I am not qualified to operate any US, German, Polish, or Russian Armored vehicles.<br><br>112. When saluting a Â“legÂ” officer, an appropriate greeting is not "Airborne leads the wa- oh...sorry sir".<br><br>113. There is absolutely no need to emulate the people from Â“Full MontyÂ” every time I hear the song "Hot Stuff".<br><br>114. I cannot trade my CO to the Russians.<br><br>115. I should not speculate on the penis size of anyone who outranks me.<br><br>116. Crucifying mice - bad idea.<br><br>117. Must not use government equipment to bootleg pornography.<br><br>118. Burn pits for classified material are not revel fires - therefore it is wrong to dance naked around them.<br><br>119. I cannot arrest children for being rude.<br><br>120. An EO briefing is probably not the best place to unveil my newest off color joke.<br><br>121. I should not use government resources to Â“waterproofÂ” dirty magazines.<br><br>122. Radioactive material should not be stored in the barracks.<br><br>123. I should not teach other soldiers to say offensive and crude things in Albanian, under the guise of teaching them how to say potentially useful phrases.<br><br>124. Two drink limit does not mean first and last.<br><br>125. Two drink limit does not mean two kinds of drinks.<br><br>126. Two drink limit does not mean the drinks can be as large as I like.<br><br>127. Â“No Drinking Of Alcoholic BeveragesÂ” does not imply that a Jack DanielÂ’s Â® IV is acceptable.<br><br>128. "Shpadoinkle" is not a real word.<br><br>129. The Microsoft Â® Â“Dancing PaperclipÂ” is not authorized to countermand any orders.<br><br>130. Â“IÂ’m drunkÂ” is a bad answer to any question posed by my commander.<br><br>131. No dancing in the turret. This especially applies in conjunction with rule #113.<br><br>132. The loudspeaker system is not a forum to voice my ideas.<br><br>133. The loudspeaker system is not to be used to replace the radio.<br><br>134. The loudspeaker system is not to be used to broadcast the soundtrack to a porno movie.<br><br>135. An order to put polish on my boots means the whole boot.<br><br>136. Shouting Â“LetÂ’s do the village! LetÂ’s do the whole fucking village!Â” while out on a mission is bad.<br><br>137. Should not show up at the front gate wearing part of a Russian uniform, messily drunk.<br><br>138. Even if my commander did it.<br><br>139. Must not teach interpreters how to make "MRE" bombs.<br><br>140. I am not authorized to sell mineral rights.<br><br>141. Not allowed to use a broadsword to disprove Â“The Pen is Mightier than the swordÂ”.<br><br>142. Â“Calvin-BallÂ” is not authorized PT.<br><br>143.

I should not threaten suicide with pop rocks and Coke Â®.<br><br>148. Putting red Â“Mike and Ike'sÂ” Â® into a prescription medicine bottle, and then eating them all in a formation is not funny.<br><br>149. Must not create new DOD forms, then insist they be filled out.<br><br>150. On Sports Day PT, a wedgie is not considered a legal tackle.<br><br>151. The proper way to report to my Commander is Â“Specialist Schwarz, reporting as ordered, SirÂ” not Â“You can't prove a thing!Â”<br><br>152. The following items do not exist: Keys to the Drop Zone, A box of grid squares, blinker fluid, winter air for tires, canopy lights, or Chem-Light Â® batteries.<br><br>153. I should not assign new privates to Â“guard the flight lineÂ”.<br><br>154. Shouldn't treat Â“piss-bottlesÂ” with extra-strength icy hot.<br><br>155. Teaching Albanian children to taunt other soldiers is not nice.<br><br>156. I will no longer perform Â“lap-dancesÂ” while in uniform.<br><br>157. If I take the uniform off, in the course of the lap-dance, it still counts.<br><br>158. The revolution is not now.<br><br>159. When detained by MP's, I do not have a right to a strip search.<br><br>160. No part of the military uniform is edible.<br><br>161. Bodychecking General officers is not a good idea.<br><br>162. Past lives have absolutely no effect on the chain of command.<br><br>163. Take that hat off.<br><br>164. There is no such thing as a were-virgin.<br><br>165. I do not get Â“that time of monthÂ”.<br><br>166. No, the pants are not optional.<br><br>167. Not allowed to operate a business out of the barracks.<br><br>168. Especially not a pornographic movie studio.<br><br>169. Not even if they *are* Â“especially patriotic filmsÂ”<br><br>170. Not allowed to Â“defectÂ” to OPFOR during training missions.<br><br>171. On training missions, try not to shoot down the General's helicopter.<br><br>172. Â“A full magazine and some privacyÂ” is not the way to help a potential suicide.<br><br>173. I am not allowed to create new levels of security clearance.<br><br>174. Furby Â® is not allowed into classified areas. (I swear to the gods, I did not make that up, it's actually DOD policy).<br><br>175. We do not Â“charge into battle, naked, like the CeltsÂ”.<br><br>176. Any device that can crawl across the table on medium, does not need to be brought into the office.<br><br>177. I am not to refer to a formation as Â“the boxy rectangle thingieÂ”.<br><br>178. I am not Â“A lesbian trapped in a man's bodyÂ”.<br><br>179. On Army documents, my race is not Â“OtherÂ”.<br><br>180. Nor is it Â“Secretariat, in the thirdÂ”.<br><br>181. PokÃ©monÂ® trainer is not an MOS.<br><br>182. There is no FM for Â“wall-to-wall counselingÂ”.<br><br>183. My chain of command has neither the time, nor the inclination to hear about what I did with six boxes of Fruit Roll-Ups. Â®<br><br>184. When operating a military vehicle I may *not* attempt something Â“I saw in a cartoonÂ”.<br><br>185. My name is not a killing word.<br><br>186. I am not the Emperor of anything.<br><br>187. Must not taunt officers in the throes of nicotine withdrawal, with cigarettes.<br><br>188. May not challenge officers to Â“Meet me on the field of honor, at dawnÂ”.<br><br>189. Do not dare SERE graduates to eat bugs. They will always do it.<br><br>190. Must not make s'mores while on guard duty.<br><br>191. Our Humvees cannot be assembled into a giant battle-robot.<br><br>192. The proper response to a briefing is not Â“That's what you thinkÂ”.<br><br>193. The Masons, and Gray Aliens are not in our chain of command.<br><br>194. Shouldn't take incriminating photos of my chain of command.<br><br>195. Shouldn't use Photoshop Â® to create incriminating photos of my chain of command.<br><br>196. I am not allowed to give tattoos.<br><br>197. I am not allowed to sing Â“Henry the VIII I amÂ” until verse 68 ever again.<br><br>198. Not allowed to lead a Â“CoupÂ” during training missions.<br><br>199. I should not confess to crimes that took place before I was born.<br><br>200. My chain of command is not interested in why I Â“just happenÂ” to have a kilt, an inflatable sheep, and a box of rubber bands in the back of my car.</div>

            </div>
            <div class='col-md body'>201. Must not valiantly push officers onto hand grenades to save the squad.<br><br>202. Despite the confusing similarity in the names, the "Safety Dance" and the "Safety Briefing" are never to be combined.<br><br>203. Â“To conquer the earth with an army of flying monkeys" is a bad long term goal to give the re-enlistment NCO.<br><br>204. NEVER nail a stuffed bunny to a cross and put it up in front of the Battalion Headquarters sign as an "Easter Desecration."<br><br>205. Don't write up false gigs on a HMMWV PMCS. ("Broken clutch pedal", "Number three turbine has frequent flame-outs", "flux capacitor emits loud whine when engaged")<br><br>206. Not allowed to get shot.<br><br>207. The Chicken and Rice MRE is *not* a personal lubricant. (Skippy wanted this noted for the record that this is not something he has ever attempted or considered! It was something we heard at dinner on 22 September 2001 and it was just so obscene it had to go here.)<br><br>208. Not allowed to play into the deluded fantasies of the civilians who are "hearing conversations" from the NSA, FBI, CIA and KGB due to the microchip the aliens implanted in their brain.<br><br>209. An airsickness bag is to be used for airsickness *only*. (Also not a Skippy-ism...this was the same dinner.)<br><br>210. Must not make T-shirts up depicting a pig with the writing "Eat Pork or Die" in Arabic to bring as civilian attire when preparing to deploy to a primarily Muslim country.<br><br>211. Don't ask LTC Steele to sign my copy of Blackhawk Down.<br><br>212. Must not go on nine deployments in six years that require a security clearance that I don't have, even if the Army tells me repeatedly that I have one and I have no reason to question them.<br><br>213. Do not convince NCO's that their razorbumps are the result of microscopic parasites.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Which Country Is Best?<br><br>During a joint exercise between American, British, and Australian forces, the three commanders get into an argument, naturally, about whose forces are best.<br><br>The American General says, "My men are the best because they are so brave. PRIVATE!" A young Private comes over, salutes, and stands at attention. The American General says, "Boy, you see that tank coming down the road? I want you to stand infront of it and get run over." The Private nods and stands in the road. SQUISH! He gets run over.<br><br>The British General shakes his head and says, "Nah, that's nothing. PRIVATE!" A young Private comes over, salutes, and stands at attention. The British General says, "Lad, you see that plane over there? Go get in it, go up to 10,000 feet, and jump out. Without a parachute." The private nods and gets in the plane. SPLAT! All<br>over the ground.<br><br>The Australian General laughs and says, "No, no, no, that's nothing. Watch. PRIVATE!" A young Private comes over, salutes, and stands at attention. The Australian General says, "Mate, see that cliff over there? I want you to go jump off it." The Private shakes his head and says, "Ah, f*** you, sir!" The Australian looks at the others and goes, "See? Now that's brave!"<br><br>Maybe you've heard it before... maybe you've not... but it's pretty good eh <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"></div>
