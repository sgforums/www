            <div class='col-md body'>Bottom line: as long as we have NS, we will make other people think twice about invading us. One of the reasons why Singapore is independent and prosperous is because no one is suicidal enough to face the SAF.<br><br>If we don't have NS, other countries may be stupid enough to play punk with us.<br><br>I know NS is not fun at all. I dare say that 99.99% of male Singaporeans do NOT want to do NS.<br><br>However, we all recognise that it's something which all of us has to do. Just because we don't like it doesn't mean that we don't do it. It sucks, but it has to be done. As simple as that.</div>

Remember the American military &amp; CIA has yet to locate Osama, has yet to kill every terrorist in Iraq &amp; A'stan.  And like most people like to associate every American war, remember Vietnam?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_evil.gif" alt="Evil or Very Mad" title="Evil or Very Mad"><br><br>Have you ever heard of Gurkhas soldiers?  They are feared through out the military world not becase of their military weapons but who they are.   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_evil.gif" alt="Evil or Very Mad" title="Evil or Very Mad"><br><br>So thinger( shouldn't it be spelled thinker if you actually use your brain cells? ), if you do not need to serve any military service or stay in Singapore, why are you so concern?  I'm only stationed in Singapore but I've felt more secure then any other country.  I also strongly believed that Singaporean would never 1 day wake up &amp; look up into the sky to see its national air carrier smashing into its land-mark buildings.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_confused.gif" alt="Confused" title="Confused"></div>

(im not sure what the deal is now, but when i still lived in singapore, werent singapore-us ties really close?). some other country would help singapore. </blockquote>You a Malaysian? Our neighbors somehow think we're American lackeys, &amp; I can't see how S'poreans could think we're that buddy-buddy with the USA either. The reality is both countries share common interests, &amp; the US isn't going to jump into the foxhole with us. (We don't even have a legal agreement like Taiwan or Australia have with them.)<br><br>No, the only SE Asian country which they have historical &amp; emotional ties with is the Phillipines, except they've closed down Clark Air Base long ago. The latter signalled they were inclined to withdraw from this region &amp;, on paper, prepared to rely on Guam &amp; Australia as the furthest staging areas this side of the world. S'pore, sensing a potential military vaccum, had to build up Changi Naval Base &amp; actively courted them to stay engaged in the neighborhood.<br><br>IMO The foreigners who'll most come to our aid - certainly before the Amercians - will be Malaysia (if we war against Indonesia), Britain (historical ties, FPDA), ANZAC (historical ties, FPDA) &amp; arguably China (geopolitical stability). Even then they'll have to think twice cuz - unless they're prepared annex the invaders' own territorities - S'pore island is way too geographically limited for defenders to dig in &amp; fight a war of attrition. All the enemy has to do is cut off our water supply.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Okay, let's take look at this:<br><br>Only Israel has a programme more intense than ours, 3 years for men and 2 for women, and the ever-present security concerns make it necessary. In Russia, where they have Cechnya it's also 2 years for men.<br><br>As more countries which do enjoy some of the peace we do, Germans do 10 months while Estonians do 6. Malaysians do about the same. They may have different objectives for NS but surely defence must also feature prominently. Yes, we don't have a big enough professional army, but do we actually need 2 years to train people for the job?<br><br>We do not have any conflicts at the moment. In fact, if anything, our relationships with other countries are on the up in general, save for the China and Tawan incidents. I know things can turn sour without warning but can we take a closer look at what other countries are doing?<br><br>2 years is a significant amount of time, lads here take 2 more years to settle down in their careers. Many probably choose to marry and have children after they make sure their careers are stable. Hence they might have fewer children...and it comes full circle and the pool of civilian soldiers/workers shrinks.<br><br>I don't believe we can attract enough PRs to make up for the shortfall and simultaneously, people will continue to leave the country for various reasons (cost of living, culture, work postings, etc) in spite of the ugly things that can happen overseas. I don't think we can do very much about this, thus we need to relook NS. We cannot do without it, but can we shorten it further?</div>
