            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote>do we actually need 2 years to train people for the job? </blockquote>I'm speaking based on my Arty experience, &amp; noting that other Formations may have different timetables.<br><br>1stly, IMO it's myopic to think NS training only in terms of active time - what do you think reservists do during in-camp? FWIW The enlisted junior commanders only assume full-time control of the COY-level appointments &amp; above <strong>after ORD</strong>, after playing 2nd fiddle to regulars &amp; scholars during the conscript period. Believe me, the 1st 2 ICTs or so is as much of a collective growing process as when NSF, albeit with a different leadership (but still hierarchial) style.<br><br>2ndly, 2 base years of active time meant only 18 months of operational status for us, centered around the mono-intakers (after their 3 months each of BMT &amp; vocational training) cuz they form the main body of the unit.<br><br>The NCOs were posted in as 9-month vets, following their own BMT-SAFINCO-SOAY courses, to oversee the mono-intakers' vocational training.<br><br>The officers were posted in as 12-month vets (same enlistment time as the NCOs), following their BMT-OCS-SOAY courses, after the mono-intakers have finished their vocational training.<br><br>The other "other ranks" - signallers, medics, etc. - were posted in as 6-month vets (same enlistment time as the mono-intakers), following their BMT-Training School courses.<br><br>Under this system, the whole unit got to ORD together at the same time, except for of course the Air Level other ranks (like me) who had to serve an extra half-year more.<br><br>Is 18 months excessive in unit training time? Without giving too much away, I can say we trained for 2 FATEPs at separate times (to gain REDCON status) &amp; it was a BN-level proficiency test. That meant roughly 3-4 months of BTY- &amp; then BN-level field exercises as a gradual build-up each time around. Of course, there's also standby duties &amp; individual weapon trainings &amp; attachments to provide live firing for infantry units, along with SAF parades &amp; exhibitions, all of which must also be crammed into the active-time timetable.<br><br>Honestly, I thought the most we could cut back on NS then was by 3 months, which that would've called for the unit to ORD immediately after its 2nd FATEP. The unit could probably live with that scenario - 13-year reservist cycle to look forward to - but is that enough for NSF officers to get their LTA rank &amp; regulars/scholars to chalk up adequate time spent with a frontline unit? Both for the latter: No.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote>If the people in Germany, Estonia, Chile, et al for whatever reason need to fall back on their civilian soldiers, would they fare miserably or have they been trained adequately (objectively and from our perspective)?</blockquote>Not the ideal way to view at this issue; most experts would consider something like % of GNP spent on the military instead. I dunno about Chile, but Germany's active forces probably number all of ours (both active &amp; reservist) &amp; Estonia is still a relatively-new small country with a Big Brother for a neighbor &amp; whom many share common Russian ethnicity.<br><br>S'pore's uniqueness is that we consider our NSmen frontline troops under the Total Defence umbrella; even Asian countries like South Korea &amp; Taiwan don't have that emphasis. The SAF's even awarded high-command promotions based on that assumption (i.e. not battle-tested). Is that ultimately foolish? To the cynics, maybe. But from the training front, we're generally attained a proficiency level that's as good as it gets - cuz acquiring REDCON status isn't easy to come by. True individual courage is another matter, but in terms of conventional-warfare skills we can hold our own as any citizen army out there, certainly the most experienced within South-East Asia.</div>

So my question is: If the people in Germany, Estonia, Chile, et al for whatever reason need to fall back on their civilian soldiers, would they fare miserably or have they been trained adequately (objectively and from our perspective)?</div></blockquote>KB, honestly whether Singapore 'boys' have to serve 2 years or more really doesn't affect me in anyway, so if I sounded like I was venting my anger, its likely a miss perception.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br><br>With regards to Germany &amp; Estonia, they do have a permanent military force capable of defending Germany or Estonia as &amp; when needed.  However, Germany &amp; Estonia choses to have conscription programe also.  Chile do have a permanent military force.  When you address them as civilian soldiers, it sounds like the militia that fought the U.S military in A'stan.  Look at that result even though its not over. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br>For Germany, if they are ever needed on the frontline, their conscripts will be mixed among their more experience &amp; better train comrades.  To compare Germany to Singapore would be wrong as Singapore has no permanent soldiers to be mixed among the conscripts when needed.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br>My personal views is that if you're considering to have a shortern service in the military, you've got to be certain that the National security of the country is not compromised in anyway.  It may seem selfish of your government asking 2 years of your youth to go through trainning that you'll probably never ever get to use but if you were to look at it from a wider perspective, you'll see that Singapore's defence relies solely on its citizerns.  So if your civilian soldiers are not at least trained to a acceptable standard, who are you going to count on? The U.S or U.N?  Hmm!   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote>There must be sufficient time allocated to make sure our NSmen are competent and lethal enough if and when the sh*t hits the fan and we are forced into war.</blockquote>Amen to that. In fact, I think the NS timeable has become very delicately finetuned, esp. in the last decade. The standard 2-year liability is the latest reform - &amp; I for one am looking forward to see how the frontline units adjust when it comes to inprocessing its personnel.<br><br>With the main body, there's still the same 18 months or so active-time status to look forward to - but how to reconcile with the junior commanders who'll be serving 6 months less (but are still slated for the same OCS &amp; SISPEC schedule)?<br><br>OCS is, what, a combined 42 weeks for its 4 terms - correct? I know SISPEC is combined 21 weeks of BSLC &amp; then either ASLC or Formation Training School. So, further subtract their BMT trainings, &amp; it'll leave both groups spending much less time at the unit itself (which has to train for operational status) under the new NS system.<br><br>Can that timeline match the SAF organizational needs? It'll have to, cuz I'm expecting even more juggling acts when the 3G Army ambitions enters the local mainstream. But, back to the point, it's difficult to shorten NS further - unless the slashing away is done at the junior-commander courses (something which could compromise negatively on skills experience &amp; leadership training).</div>
