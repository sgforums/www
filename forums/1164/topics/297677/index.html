But maybe it is even better to say "you can conquer a land, but can you conquer the will of the people?"<br><br>The invasion of Iraq on false pretextes was a horrible scandal. But the worse thing was the Americans, didn't know what to do after the "shock &amp; awe" phase. After they have bombed the shxt out of people, they don't know what to do next.<br><br>At least Iraq is better than Vietnam because at least the US are robbing Iraq of oil in exchange for its dead US soldiers.<br><br>But I am grateful to the US for Vietnam, because if not for them, I may now be typing in Vietnamese and my currency is called a "DONG".<br><br>But I just wish the US know better how to install a proper administration after war.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>The British had actually focused more on protecting and working with the civillans to get Basra restored to some degree of working order for the past few years, if you follow the British News reports.  And contary to American strategy and timeplan, the British had actually planned for an exit within a suitable timeframe all along.<br><br>The pictures that you post only depicts the negative and does not do those soldiers there justice.<br><br>Now to get down to the other aspects of judging the performance of the British in Basra:<br><br>War Fighting Capabilities: A<br>The Desert Rats had destroyed 19 tanks in a modern tank battle when the British stormed Basra. Basra was the hardest battle when the invasion was launched; the US troops got off relatively easy compared to the Rats.<br><br>Policing Capabilities: B<br>There's only 4500 soldiers in a city of 2 million. Do you expect castles to be built in a day? And they got take care of suicide bombers too. Give the soldiers their due credit.<br><br>Capturing Basra Civillans Hearts: C<br>While initially welcomed, relations soured after a number of incidents, one of which had a soldier court martialled. A BBC poll revealed that 85% thought that their safety had actually detoriated compared to before. 66% were positive that things will improve now that the British had left but 10% would had preferred that the British leaves some presence behind as a safety precaution.<br><br>Handling of British Civillans Reactions: C<br>The British civillan population actually disagreed over Blair's decision to send troops to Iraq. They cited past British policies of Defensive and Protective wars and said that the Blair Government did not abide by that. Some, I would believe were also unhappy that the former Imperial Power could only play second fiddle to the US.<br><br>Political fallout: C<br>To the West and East, not much affects them.
