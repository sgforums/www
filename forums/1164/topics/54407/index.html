            <div class='col-md body'>If we launch a pre-emptive strike, there will be a risk that the surgical strike will escalate to a full-scale war. That will achieve the the terrorists' objective of inciting violence and instability.<br><br>Also must balance the risk and political fallout of the war with the "benefit" of destroying the terrorist cell. This will bound to be some collateral damage.<br><br>At most they can put one or two bombs here and there. Even if they have two are three "Balis" in singapore less than 1000 will die, this is much less than the loss in humar lives if the pre-emptive strike result in a full-scale war.<br><br>If some Malaysian rebels are holed up with P.

            <div class='col-md body'>A few thousand lives lost in a few terrorist bombings can mean alot to Singapore, where the people are the resources. The thousands that died can or may include important individual that contributes alot to the economy... and many other ppl from different wakes of live. Perhaps you are right, sending in troops without prior notice may cause the matter to escalate into a full-scale war but i still believe that sending in our own troops would be a good solution to terrorism.<br><br>Our neighbour's troops, commits war crimes on their mission. Not the first time i read that in the papers. (eg rapes and others). Of the many people who are rounded up and detained, majority of them unarmed. Recently, troops even turned against their own government. What ever the reason, it still shows how the troops conduct themselves. A bomb can explode right behind the security forces who had been guarding the area. They can't even guard against themselves, not to mention "helping" others.<br><br>Of course we must not kill Diplomacy. We can still co-operate with them, but we should send in our elites. It's a matter of national Security and i believe the Armed Forces shoulders the responsibility of protecting the people. We are better equiped, better-trained and strongly believed to be better-desciplined. We may not have experience but its better than sitting back, set up checkpoints and barriers and wait for the terrorists to hit against the barriers.<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="Arrow" title="Arrow"> I correct my statement on un-notified attacks in other states.<br><br></div>
