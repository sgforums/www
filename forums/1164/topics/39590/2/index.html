The significance of adrianople in terms of shift of power could not be disputed, but by that time the legions had been beaten already on a couple of occasions, by goths, by celt, by parthians, by persians, you name it.. By adrianople there already is no illusion of roman invincibility.

The combine greek army at Plataea was in the region of 80 000 with the spartens providing 8000 of their spartiates together with helot complements.<br>MArathon was in the region of 11,000.<br>And the stand at Thermopylae although often only mentions the 300 spartens but it involved up to 7000 heavy infantry of sparta and her allies.<br>As for MTW, i also only have a gf2 but one tweak that worked for me was to go to the configuration of your graphics setting and lower the memory used for PCI texture to around 5 or 6 for openGL (or was it 3d3) .It helps a lot, most battles are incredibly smooth</div></blockquote>ahh ok ill give it a try<br>And yes i know there was allies at Thermopylae but the numbers i have seen was around a mere 3,000-5,000 not 7,000! hehe they were mostly Thebes i think cannot really recall.But the Spartans were formitable you gotta admit that Surrendering only once to Atheians during the Peopalyse(spelling?) war <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"> Those battles of old were great....staring you enemy down before charging into battle and actually seeing the fear/anger in the eyes of your enemy!!!</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>And some sources quotes around ten thousand. Seven thousand was the figure quoted by Herodotus, but keep in mind herodotus was the one who quoted xerxes army to be in the millions.<br>Thebans were forced to go as hostages of the spartans, the moment the persian army crossed Thermopylae, Thebes capitulated, at the battle at Plataea the thebans were actually on the side of the Persian. The main forces were the Spartan Thespians, Thessalians and Phocians and probably a few more which i cannot remember. Not only the Thebans fought on the side of the Persians i think there were even a contingent of companion cavary from Macedonia on the side of Xerxes. I think there was even a prophecy where the blood of a spartan king was required for greece to be saved. But the oracle often had its own agendas so we wouldn't really know would we.<br>I ever read a book by Plutarch on the Lives of a few spartan kings and also in it was quotes from various spartan sources. Amoung them are well known ones like "A spartan returns with his shield or upon it" or when Xerxes asked Leonidas to lay down his arms his response was "come and get them" pretty hollywood yah. Another was a about an ally whining about how the sky was filled with persian arrows that the sky became dark. Leonidas or one of his officers responded."Good, we fight better under shade"<br><br>i guess spartans became pretty famous for one liners.<br><br>"Go Stranger and to Sparta Tell<br><br>Faithful to Her Laws,<br><br>Here, We Lie"<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Yep, the macedonians surrendered to the persians although at that time the macedon kingdom was rather barbaric as compared to the greek city states, they spoke a different dialect of greek.
