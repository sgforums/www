            <div class='col-md body'>"With Amyntas I., who was contemporary with Darius Hystaspis, light dawns upon Macedonian history. We find that by this time the Macedonian monarchs of this line had made themselves masters of Pieria and Bottiaea, had crossed the Axius and conquered Mygdonia and Anthemus, had dislodged the original Eordi from Eordia and themselves occupied it, and had dealt similarly with the Alm6pes in Almopia, on the Rhaedias. But the advance of the Persians into Europe gave a sudden check to this period of prosperity. After a submission which was more nominal than real, in B.C. 507, the Macedonians, in B.C. 492, became Persian subjects, retaining, however, their own kings, who accepted the position of tributaries. Amyntas I., who appears to have died about B.C. 498, was succeeded by his son, Alexander I., king at the time of the great invasion of Xerxes, who played no unimportant part in the expedition, B.C. 480 to 470.<br><br>The repulse of the Persians set Macedonia free; and the career of conquest appears to have been at once resumed. Crestonaea and Bisaltia were reduced, and the Macedonian dominion pushed eastward almost to the Strymon. The authority of the monarchs of Pella was likewise extended over most of the inland Macedonian tribes, as the Lyncestis, the Eleimiots, and others, who however retained their own kings."<br>http://www.historyofmacedonia.org/AncientMacedonia/Rawlinson.html<br><br>that site quite power.

What was the reasons for this decline..</blockquote>Typical Asian Surpremnessium(sic) The Chinese thought they were the best in terms of culture and had no need for western inventions and ideals....that has and always will be their downfall...sadly<br>I mean they had cannons and guns and rockets but did not use them like the west did!!Infact during the Opium wars the Chinese sad they would repel the invaders the moment they hit the beaches with their bigger cannons!!But they were infact out ranged by the better made English cannons.The Chinese might have invented weapons but the westerners invented warfare!!<br><br><blockquote>Oh yes and about hannibal, we will get to Zama shortly but why do you think he did not take Rome. Politics? Unable to siege a city? Siege weapons? hoping for a treaty with favourable terms for carthage?<br></blockquote>Well he lack seige equipment and had too little troops.....a mere 30,000?The defeat of his Brother who was bringing reinforcements  and the lack of revolt among rome's vassals was the death blow to his plans.How could he Storm a city that after putting 80,000 men into the field and had them all killed/defeated/capture could raise another 20,000men and also had 50,000 men roaming around their empire!!!Hack the Carthagins(sic) destroyed the Roman Navy twice!!!!! and yet each time rome came back with a bigger navy!!How do you defeat someone like that?!</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Much blame was put on the conservatism of the Ming Dynastiy. The conservatism was muchly blamed on the power mongering of the emperor's mandarins. At their insistance China finally Kwan Men Bi Shou. The gigantic fleet that Zheng he sailed to africa with was sunk. That fleet at that time was bigger then wat the whole of europe can put together.<br>Continued conservatism and isolation coupled with the leadership living in denial meant that China fell further and further behind. In contrast was Japan, after being forced to open her ports for trade, she quickly adapted western gun technology and for a while cou;ld built better arqubuses then the europeans. This came to an end during the tokugawa but technology was forcebly adapted during the late meiji and after period culmanating in the victory over the russians in Tsushima.<br><br></div>
