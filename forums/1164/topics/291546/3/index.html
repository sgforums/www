            <div class='col-md body'>Makes me wonder what they are taught in NCC these days.<br><br>Anyway, back to the question on the NCC cadets creating a ruckus on the MRT.<br><br>Firstly, these boys are in the same uniform that the SAF dons.  They are essentially SAF equipment and anyone who wears them are subject to military law.<br><br>If their conduct were questionable, any SAF personnel regardless of rank, has an obligation to remind them of the responsibilities and conduct required in uniform.<br><br>Of course, thats a very legalistic point of view.<br><br>As a citizen, we all have a moral obligation to educate our younger generation. We all have should be able to speak up against what is obviously wrong.  The sad truth is that most of us do not like "trouble" and choose to turn a blind eye to what is wrong.<br><br>Rank and NCC aside.  If you are an ordinary guy sitting at the back of the bus, u see these kids in front of you, whip out a marker and starts vandalizing the chairs, would you speak up?<br><br>Rank in view.  If you see a "Major", board the MRT, and rushes to sit down on one of the seats instead of allowing the pregnant lady behind him, would you as a "CPL" speak up?<br><br>So when it comes to these cadets, I'm suggesting that people unleash every four letter word at them for their behavior.   But just that we play an active role in educating them.  If they are rude in their response, then we let the disciplinary measures come in.<br><br>I've personally addressed an NCC cadet for being severely "in/out" of uniform before. I was not in uniform nor did I identify myself as part of SAF.  Firstly, he was in Long 4, with his top button undone, and a white collared T-shirt inside, with the collars sticking out of his no.4.  It was a horrid sight that I couldn't stomach.<br><br>Of course, I could just be totally Singaporean and "Aiya, let someone else deal with him."   I guess I just wasn't having a good day..<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"></div>

And we all know singaporeans will hardly try out other games if it's not dota or CS....or maple story.<br><br>How about a realistic game, where you add in all the annoying bits we see in real life.<br><br>Fight a war with supplies, if you got cut off...you will run out of bullets.<br><br>Spend a few hours marching or travelling from base to battleground.<br><br>Getting shot and getting injured...instead of health decreasing, you have to limp or ask your friend to carry you back to base if you die.<br><br>You have to listen to your squad commanders and etc, no such thing like rambo or lone wolf. If you can't listen to them...you can be shot( in game terms, you will be banned)<br><br>If you die, you will be forced to leave the game.<br><br>Factor in the physics, that wind speed can make your bullet miss the target even if you got scope.<br><br>You can't stay in aiming posisition all the time...you will get damn tired from it.<br><br>You got stamia limit, after carrying all the equipment, you will feel tired, making you hard to run or aim properly if you travel long distance.<br><br>You have to go through months of basic training before you can start the game.<br><br>You can be friendly fired on even if your friend did not do it on purpose.<br><br>There are no coloured name distincition for you to tell if that guy far away is friendly or enemy.<br><br>Spend hours getting stuck on things call guard duty.<br><br>Spend hours waiting in the base waiting for a fight to happen.<br><br>Spend hours cleaning equipment, if not, you weapons will jam during battle.<br><br>Spend hours doing footdrills for you to get to know your squad and company members.<br><br>There is no such things as pro or noob. Even if you play for a long time, one bullet hitting you can still kill you and put you out of action. A experienced or pro player can still get killed by things called landmine, missile hit, friendly fire,<br>stray artillery, crashing into a wall while driving and kenna snipe before you know it.<br><br>See if any idiot still want to say game is a good indiciation to tell a fighting skill of a person.<br><br>And most people who say they are good in CS don't even play any other type of game.<br><br>And I doubt they will play a game with all the features I listed above.<br><br>PS. This is from a guy who isn't in NS yet.<br><br></div>
