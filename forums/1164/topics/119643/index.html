            <div class='col-md body'>I have noticed that the Merkeva MK3 have a HMG(should be a 0.5) just on top of the main gun near to the point where the main gun joins to the turrent. It doesn't look like a manually operated co-axial because it is too far away for either the commander or the gunner to reach. I know that a HMG is often used in the past(before the time of the laser range-finder) to find the range by actually shooting at the target because the range of of the 0.5 round is similar to that of the rounds fired from the main gun.<br>Second question is what is the purpose for having a mortar(i don't know what calibre) in the turret?

            <div class='col-md body'>Is it accurate then to say that the Israelis does not see the need for a 25mm calibre and instead chose the option of 0.5" HMG with the 60mm mortar as a better solution?</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>So what you are saying is that the Isarelis incoparated the IFV and the MBT in their Merkeva series of MBT? I think you are not too far off as how many operational MBTs in the world is equipped with 60mm motar,HMG and even a small compartment for carrying troops within the tank? This is a very innovative idea! <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"></div>

One need to come out of the turret to reload.<br><br>As for 60mm mortar is for another situation, especially w/o infantry support for tanks.<br><br>One thing , Israeli are quite innovative and come out with many ideas based on their war experiences.<br><br>IDF's IFV so far only wif 0.5 HMG and 7.62 MG, why they are not using any mid calibre cannons, I have no idea.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Yes the Israelis are very innovative......but practical at the same time. Most of their 'solutions' are really quite simple to implement.<br><br>A dozer blade as additional armor? Useful for clearing road blocks too.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>from what i know though, is that israelis don't use merkavas as IFVs unless it is an emergency. Firstly, there are no firing ports in the merkava so you can't shoot out of it. And secondly, for 8 soldiers that you carry, you have to forgo nearly 40 rounds of ammo. It is good for evacuation though.</div>
