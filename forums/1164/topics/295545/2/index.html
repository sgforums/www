We can easily release 6-8 of them for to do a 1-1 replacement of the current AVLB asset we have and keep the turret as spare parts.

So if they are slow, it is definitely a problem.<br><br>Of course you can argue that the M60 can move to objective earlier but sometimes things aren't that ideal.<br><br>But I just think the slower M60 will just be relegated to the 2nd grade armour units instead of being junked.

Need not waste an MBT for such trival work. In fact the word CEV is already consider an artifact in CE world.</div></blockquote>Well, taking IDF's example, junking working equipment is never acceptable.<br><br>IMO, the Centurion still has a lot of fight left. Its 105mm gun can still knock out everything across the border with the PT-91 being the only threat.<br><br>Its other asset is its very heavy armour, which increases crew survivability.<br><br>Again, the IDF have kept the Centurion in combat service though they have converted it to other uses.<br><br>Smelting pot? Probably not.<br><br>...<br><br>The demolition gun is no longer popular cos MBT's now spot 120mm guns and can do quite a bit of "demolishing" themselves.<br><br>But if the our CEV is supporting AMX13 units or other "tankless" units, then the 165mm gun is NOT something you write off. I am sure it can seriously demolish any part of a building it fires at.<br><br>...<br><br>Again, I want to point out that 100 or even 150 Leos may sound a lot in peacetime. But in combat many tanks can be knocked out or damaged in just one day of action.<br><br>With the infantry AT capabilites so improved and widespread these days, about 300 MBTs would be right for considering battle damage replacement. And I mean 300 MBTs -  not counting AMX13.<br><br>Our number superiority in every weapon system must continue to be outrageous and remain at "uncomfortable" levels for our neighbours. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>It all boils down to the doctrine we use, I believe that the MBTs should not be used in an engagement role in a conflict, but rather as a buffer, while our good'ol AMX13s and Tempests go out and harass the enemy, suck them towards the MBTs and let them take them out.<br><br>Or, if the whole unit were to be used as terror on wheels, I would recommend having some ST 5 armoured 5 tonners, mount them with sandbags and 2 .50cals., one in front and one behind loaded with plenty of .50cal ammo travelling in front of the convoy, followed by the Leo2s with Primus, support vehicles, BXs behind and covered in the rear by AMX13s or Tempests. The plan of the game is to have the 5 tonners roar into any urban area with guns blazing as fireflies and draw panic fire while the Leo2s can take their time to blow those firing away.

            <div class='col-md body'>Well we are not IDF and our neighbours aren't the million strong arab either.<br><br>In the new doctrine, the need for heavy armour is mainly to thrust and punch a hole in a  fortified enemy defence, and not really deploy to protect the soft skin vehicle. For that job 100 leo2 with some form of improve armour is more then enough. And I see no point keep 2 sets of ammo either, in this case 120 and 105. I think it about time we let go the SM1 and the centurion if it ever eixist and put our finite resources on the leo2 and the upcomming wheel combat vehicle.<br><br>Anyway, the army is not that cash rich so keeping so many relics doesn't help to transform into the desire armed force we wish to be.<br></div>

I would actually use them to be deployed behind the MBTs to strike any AFVs, Tanks that show up with their Spikes and Milans. And like I said...the tonners are to draw fire.</div>
