            <div class='col-md body'>here's a little tidbit... it's nothing new but worth thinking about.  Rafael developed the python3 (using US-based technology) but later sold some to PRC and never admitted it becos of some EU issues...  later, PRC unveiled the PL8 SAM and during the aerial encounter between PRC and US a few years back, photo/video footage revealed that PRC are actually using the python3 as an A-A missile too.  think also about the failed Phalcon sale which was eventually blocked by US...<br><br>And has anyone considered that given the state of animosity b/w Iran and Israel, why did the israelis agree to be a party in the Iran-Contra scandal during the 80s?  basically, israel was a middle man and helped transport the arms/ammo to iran...<br><br>Morale of the story?  the israelis will sell things to various countries for the right price.  some are friendly countries, some are not... some are open sales, some are not.  just becos they do not officially declare it does not mean it did not happen<br><br>btw, u do know that the israelis did sell some captured soviet Migs and SAMs (SA6) to the US rite? again, it was not officially declared ...  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>
