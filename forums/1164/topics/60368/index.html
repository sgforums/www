            <div class='col-md body'>OK, so who lied?<br><br><strong>Bush lied for claiming he had rebuked me: Mahathir</strong><br><br>"KUALA LUMPUR : Malaysian Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad said US President George W. Bush was lying when he claimed to have rebuked him over his remarks about Jews ruling the world, the official Bernama news agency reported.<br><br>"It's the biggest lie. If he had rebuked me I'm quite sure I would have rebuked him also," Dr Mahathir was quoted as saying when he arrived home after a series of visits to neighbouring countries.<br><br>Dr Mahathir said it was common for someone who could lie about the existence of weapons of mass destruction in order to go to war (in Iraq) to lie about what he had said, the agency reported.<br><br>He told reporters that from what he remembered, Bush had pulled him aside at an Asia-Pacific summit in Bangkok last week only to explain why he had made such a strong statement over Dr Mahathir's remarks about Jews.<br><br>"I think he wants to support his officer (White House spokesman Scott McClellan)," Dr Mahathir said.<br><br>McClellan said last Monday that Bush had pulled Dr Mahathir aside at the summit to denounce his "wrong and divisive" comments.<br><br>A day later, Dr Mahathir insisted that Bush had not rebuked him. "All he told me was: I regret having to use strong words against you," the Malaysian leader said.<br><br>"He did not rebuke me at all and after that, we were walking practically hand-in-hand."<br><br>However, Bush insisted on Wednesday that he had in fact delivered a rebuke.<br><br>In a briefing on his Australia-bound airplane after the summit, Bush said he had pulled Dr Mahathir aside at the Thailand gathering to tell him personally that he thought the comments were "reprehensible."<br><br>"I said, 'they're divisive and unnecessary.' I didn't yell at him, I just told him," the US president told reporters.<br><br>The comments in question were made by Dr Mahathir at the summit of the Organisation of the Islamic Conference (OIC) in Malaysia in mid-October.<br><br>Dr Mahathir said then: "The Europeans killed six million Jews out of 12 million. But today the Jews rule this world by proxy."<br><br>The notoriously outspoken Asian leader, whose comments drew global condemnation and outrage from Western nations, added that 1.3 billion Muslims could not be defeated by a few million Jews. - AFP "</div>

Dr. Mahathir <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"> </strong><br><br>He has demonstrated himself as a peaceful &amp; tolerant leader by showing his great love &amp; admiration toward the Jews of the world during a speech in recent international meeting held in KL. His speech not only inspires those in the meeting , it also inspires all the people in the world especially those great leaders from Israel, Europe, Australia &amp; US etc. All of them would like to have a "word" or two with this great leader,Dr. Mahathir , as demontrated by President Bush of the US. Therefore he will most probably be nominated along with Mr. Bin Landen for the Nobel Peace award for the year 2002. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br>He has also demonstrated that he is extremely hardworking leader for Malaysia during the currency crisis which was revealed by his son recently about how he tried to learn about International economics from his Economic Advsior which he know nuts about it even though he has been the leader for Malaysia for many years .  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br>I even heard that the international science community would like to study his brain after his death just like the Einstein's brain , so that they could learn how a pea brain like him could rule a country for so long.He is a miracle ,isn't it! <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br>Sinagpore is also indebted to him by teaching Sinagpore leaders especially Lao Lee the new art form of International negotiation &amp; relationship during the water talk, that is Talk is Cheap, only those in black &amp; white in international agreement will have any bearing.<br>He even came out with a new theory of circumventing that too. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mad.gif" alt="Mad" title="Mad"><br>Therefore , he will be one of the great friend of Singapore just like the Former President of Indonesia, Dr. Hababi. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br>As for the Military nuts here, Dr. Mahathir also inspire the MAF to the standard of "NATO" for many years <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"> , but too bad for the people of the region especially Brunei, they seem to slacken slightly which was demonstrated to them recently about the oil exploration.<br><br>I recently heard a rumour that he will change his name so that he will be more in tuned with the Malay in Malaysia, afterall he does not has pure Malay ancestry and his eventual status as a retiree to Dr. MUDMATI.<br>Therefore ,<br><span class="large"><strong>HAIL TO THE GREAT LEADER, &amp; A GOOD FRIEND OF SINGAPORE, Dr.MUDMATI !

            <div class='col-md body'>Here's more from our esteemed fren:<br><br><strong>Mahathir hits back at critics of Jewish remarks</strong><br><br>KUALA LUMPUR, : Malaysian Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad hit back against those who condemned him for saying that Jews rule the world but were silent when the Muslim Prophet Muhammad was called a terrorist.<br><br>"Are we not allowed to say that we are angry with the Jews? Are the Jews some kind of creature who cannot be condemned in any way?" Mahathir asked when questioned by reporters about the fierce international criticism of his remarks.<br><br>He said he knew a lot of Jewish people and was not against them, the official Bernama news agency reported.<br><br>"I am against those Jews who kill Muslims and the Jews who support the killers of Muslims," he was quoted as saying.<br><br>Mahathir said that he did not care if the Europeans, who were among his major critics, did not like him.<br><br>"I have European friends. But when they do something wrong, I am going to tell them that it is wrong.<br><br>"You say that you are not under the influence of the Jews and yet when I criticise the Jews, the whole of the European Union wants to condemn me.<br><br>"But when somebody condemns the Muslims, calls my Prophet (Muhammad) terrorist and all that, did the European Union say anything? Which shows that they are under the thumb of the Jews."<br><br>US Christian fundamentalist preacher Jerry Falwell called Muhammad a "terrorist" in a television interview in September last year, sparking outrage in the Muslim world.<br><br>More recently, a United States general has been under fire for casting the war on terrorism as a Christian struggle against Satan, but retains his post as deputy undersecretary of defense for intelligence.<br><br>Lieutenant General William Boykin recalled in a speech how a top lieutenant of Somali warlord Mohammed Farah Aidid, Osman Otto, boasted on CNN he would never be caught because Allah would protect him.<br><br>"Well, you know what?" Boykin was quoted as saying. "I knew that my God was bigger than his. I knew that my God was a real God and his was an idol."<br><br>Mahathir regularly points to such utterances as proof of double standards applied in western countries.<br><br>Asked Monday why some Muslim leaders did not openly express support over his remarks about Jews, Mahathir said that possibly they were afraid that action would be taken against them.<br><br>"They are much weaker than we are. They may have more money but they are still dependent upon the Europeans.<br><br>"Because of that, they are reluctant to make their voices heard but privately of course they will support," he said.<br><br>At the weekend, Mahathir said a call by a US-based Jewish lobby group for an economic boycott against Malaysia over his remarks may hurt economically but the country would not give in to "blackmail".<br><br>The influential Simon Wiesenthal Center last week called on investors and tourists to avoid Malaysia after Mahathir branded Jews "arrogant" and accused them of controlling the world by proxy.<br><br>- AFP<br><br>wah... he is so intelligent and brilliant!</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>From CNA:<br><a href="http://www.channelnewsasia.com/stories/afp_asiapacific/view/54368/1/.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.channelnewsasia.com/stories/afp_asiapacific/view/54368/1/.html</a><br><br><blockquote>WASHINGTON : The US Senate voted unanimously to tie religious freedom to 1.2 million dollars in military aid to Malaysia, after that country's prime minister sparked a row by claiming Jews rule the world.<br><br>The measure would require the State Department to determine that Malaysia "supports and promote religious freedoms, including tolerance for people of the Jewish faith" before releasing the money.<br><br>The amendment to the overall 18-billion-dollar foreign aid budget does provide exceptions for national security concerns.<br><br>It still needs to win support from the House of Representatives, which has passed a resolution condemning Malaysian Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad over his remarks at the summit of the Organization of the Islamic Conference in mid-October.<br><br>Mahathir said then: "The Europeans killed six million Jews out of 12 million. But today the Jews rule this world by proxy."<br><br>The notoriously outspoken Asian leader, whose comments drew global condemnation and outrage from Western nations, noted that 1.3 billion Muslims could not be defeated by a few million Jews.</blockquote>You see, Dr.Mudmati inspirational speech has prompted the US House of Representatives to sing praises about him. This will certainly speed up the 1.2 million dollars in military aid to Malaysia. Malaysians are so lucky to have such a leader, too bad he is going to retirement. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br>For the Military Nuts here, this will most certainly speed up the acquistion of the US F/A-18 E/F fighters, maybe they could be getting them with discount!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>What Doctor Mad HAtter said is about the only redeeming quality I have for him now, its the only thing he has ever said that makes any sense, next to Hitler. Yes Jews rule America by proxy, that in turn gives them near enough power to rule the world via America. Hitler was also right in saying that Jews have penetrated into the higher orders of Western administration, historically Jews have. Israel has got no oil for America, yet USA backs Israel because it has to satisfy its powerful jewish minority.</div>

These societies r not only not in tuned with the rest of the world, with emphasis on the way of thinking of the middle ages and progressively going toward that direction.The Taleban &amp; Iran are good examples.<br><br>Since the oil supply will eventually run out without any progress on other industries &amp; with these fundametal muslims will only be the hinderance for them to modernise. The future for these societies certainly does not look good, that why these muslim intellectuals criticise them but instead of re-evaluate what going on , they r been prosecuted. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>Therefore it will not be good for the whole world if the Arab societies do not modernise, the world certainly do not wish to have a group of disgruntled Arab countries that most probably destabilise the region &amp; even the whole world. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_sad.gif" alt="Sad" title="Sad"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>Malaysia brushes off US threat to cut military aid over Jews remarks </strong><br><br>PUTRAJAYA : Malaysian Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad on Tuesday brushed off a threat by the US Senate to cut US$1.2 million in military aid over his criticism of Jews.<br><br>"It doesn't make any difference to us. We don't really need that money. I think we can find that one million dollars here," Mahathir told an impromptu news conference.<br><br>He also appeared to imply that the Senate vote was proof of his claim that Jews rule the world by proxy.<br><br>"They are very annoyed about what I said about the Jews. This is their reaction, so what I say is true."<br><br>The US Senate voted unanimously on Monday to tie the military training aid to a report by the State Department determining whether Malaysia "supports and promote religious freedoms, including tolerance for people of the Jewish faith".<br><br>The move still needs to win support from the House of Representatives, which has already passed a resolution condemning Mahathir over his remarks at the summit of the Organisation of the Islamic Conference in mid-October.<br><br>Mahathir said then: "The Europeans killed six million Jews out of 12 million. But today the Jews rule this world by proxy. They get others to fight and die for them."<br><br>On Tuesday, in response to the Senate vote, he said: "They (the US) want to dictate to the world. We are all being run by the US Senate."<br><br>Malaysia's relations with Washington have nosedived after reaching a high point in May last year when Mahathir was welcomed at the White House by President George W. Bush to be thanked personally for his support in the war on terrorism.<br><br>Since then, while maintaining his strong condemnation of terrorism and detaining local Islamic militants, Mahathir has been increasingly critical of Bush's handling of the campaign.<br><br>He has accused the US of using the war on terrorism as a pretext for a war on Islam, and predicted that invading Iraq would simply inflame Muslim hatred of the US and create more terrorists.<br><br>Mahathir retires on Friday after running this moderate mainly-Muslim country, which has large practising Christian, Hindu and Buddhist minorities, for the past 22 years.<br><br>Malaysia has no diplomatic relations with Israel, and Mahathir regularly points to the plight of the Palestinians as a root cause of Islamic terrorism.<br><br>His lack of concern about the one million dollars in military aid can be judged against Malaysia's recent orders for Russian fighter jets, French submarines, Polish tanks and British missile systems running into billions of dollars. - AFP"</div>
