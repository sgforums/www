            <div class='col-md body'>In combat performance, the Buffalo was no poorer than the early F4F Wildcats that held the fort in late 1941/early 1942 against the Japanese. It was poor manufacturing QC, underpowered engine, but more importantly poor pilot training and wrong tactics that caused it to suffer in combat. If a late-war Hellcat tried to engage a Zero in a turning fight the results would more or less be the same.<br><br>Its weak undercarriage also caused many accidents.<br><br>I recommend the book Buffalos over Singapore to correct many misconceptions about this aircraft<br></div>

Anyway the Brits tried to lighten the Buffalo by tossing a pair of guns, the radio, and changing the 50-cals to .303s. The USN F2A-1/2s were fine weight-wise, its the British 339s and the USMC F2A-3s (as used over Midway) which were too heavy.<br><br>Still the main causes of the debacle over Singapore were still poor pilot training, wrong tactics and lack of early warning of Japanese raids (which was made worse by the Buffalo's poor climb rate)</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hi Viper 52<br><br>U are right... the brits tried to toss those .50 and go with the 30 cal ... I guess even with that fighting against the Ki43 and Nates .. the buffalo is still no match ! not to forget we have bunch of Hurricanes in Kallang!  didn't do much to change the situation.<br><br>Tex Hill and Joe Foss that I met has talk about never to turn with teh Japanese A6m2 and the KI43 .. they will eat lunch with any of the Allied fighters.

Someone suggested that one of the squadron pilots go to Kauhava (Air Force Academy) to lecture on tactics, 'how to wage war with Brewsters'. That was because the Americans also started waging war and they had no clue how to go about it. There in the Pacific when they started fighting it was completely pitiful. They had three engagements where Brewsters were used. And in the last one they had 17 Brewsters in one aerial engagement, and if I remember correctly, 13 were shot down. After that all the Brewsters were sent to Florida for their Air Force cadets.<br><br>And all of this was the result of them attacking Zeros. They didn't consider at all that the Zero had no armour, was made of wood and was much lighter. But it had an engine of the same size. And they (Americans) started turn-fighting them (Zeros). So, the Brewsters were shot down. They just should have used rocking-chair (vertical) tactics, attack and pull out. </blockquote>The Finnish pilot Captain Hans Henrik "Hasse" Wind 30.7.1919-24.7.1995 had 75 aerial victories, double recipient of the Mannerheim Cross (the highest military award in Finland) (39 kills in the Brewster)<br><br><a href="http://www.saunalahti.fi/fta/finace02.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.saunalahti.fi/fta/finace02.htm</a><br>[/quote]</div>

Theres a memorial there dedicated to Australian soldiers, and all their campaigns were on the memorial. I went along, then when i got to singapore i stopped, my throat went dry and tears welled up in my eyes. I know how hard the Aussies fought for sg.</div>
