            <div class='col-md body'>I have to agree that Iraq love presenting alot of desprate propaganda  but , same with the US. See CNA to witness how bias , bitchy those american journalist and newspresenter can be.<br><br>Both sides tok too much cock so do give some respect to that iraqi minister. Im touched to see ministers , young mens of iraq standing up together not running away ( although there will be some ) fighting for their homeland. They might not win the war , but they make their land a  difficult target for their invaders .<br><br>Everytime , i like putting incidents into my shoe for a thought. This time , im asking myself whether will ministers , top brass leaders and young men of Singapore stand up agaisnt our enemy?? As wat our minister said . We might not win , but we will make any attempt a hard one for the enemy , hopefully deter them. I believe thats wat the iraqis are thinking.<br><br>Salute to them and may god have mercy on their souls.</div>

Un/fortunately, intelligence appears to be one thing the iraqi regime lacks when it comes to dealing with propangada, but then again, not to many people think much in Iraqi.<br><br>Poor them, it's their loss to resist allied troops. It's pretty much lose lose for them, after all, they are dying for a regime that's not worth dying for, using them like pawns. They may be sincere, but sincerely wrong.<br><br>At least some Iraqis are seeing some sense and are helping the allies as Iraqi freedom fighters, fighting alongside the allies and helping them point out the enemy from the civies.<br><br>May Saddam fall fast, and save the bloodshed.</div>

Hundreds of units that could have been used better engaging the allies as a organized enemy have been wasted when apparently they order of the day was to engage in "unconventional" warfare. This has allowed a lot of iraqi units to surrender or desert because they feel left to their own devices or get picked off one by one because they are scattered about. 20 iraqi tanks advanced with no cover whatsoever to engage the allies peacemeal and they were destroyed within 30 seconds.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Either that or it's one big mess. The US is going in smart, instead of thinking of taking on the entire area whole, they are gonna take it down in bite sized pieces, limiting their own losses and keeping the amount of fighting down to a minimum. This conversely will have a bad effect on the  Iraqi defenders because they want the Americans to chiong straight in and batter themselves against their defences, something they have set themselves for. Now it turns out the americans are content to take over tiny areas of Badhdad a bit at a time, consolidating their position before they move on to the next.<br><br>Though if what CNN is saying is true, then the Iraqi defence is in serious trouble. If US tanks can just go recon in Badhdad and shoot up things before running back to their own lines.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Now with US tanks rolling about their city unchecked and killing their forces like flies, I await eagerly the "information" minister's latest report.<br><br>The poor thing about the iraqi ministers is that they are too frightened to contradict saddam and give an proper picture of the way things are turning out. Come up with sensible propangada for once. I wonder if Saddam even knows what's really going on or is he listening to the "reports" of his ministers who are too afriad to tell him the truth as well...<br><br>That is assuming with tanks breathing down their neck they will still contuine to hold press confrences... Most likely they are fearing smart bombs desending on them.</div>
