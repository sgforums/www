This is due, perhaps, to the emphasis on the second language, which is the mother-tongue, at its expense.<br>The true English-speaking generation of students, which grew up in the seventies, are now in their forties. Some of them are English teachers. Students who have had the privilege of learning from them picked up good English skills.<br>Many of those who grew up after the seventies spoke the mother-tongue more often than English and as a result, carried a less-than-sufficient command of English into adulthood. Some became teachers. Without a good grounding in English, these teachers could not possibly nurture good English students. So, as the years went by, subsequent generations of students taught by the students of such teachers moved into adulthood without acquiring proficiency in English. Things turned from bad to worse because the standard of English picked up by each graduating class from each graduating teacher dropped steadily over the years.<br>Today, English Language teachers are required to attend grammar courses. This confirms that the Ministry of Education is indeed aware of the need to build up the English Language among the ranks of its English teachers. Not many students take up English Literature nowadays - a sure sign that all is not well.<br>On this website, we wish to share some English skills with visitors to our website who are studying in primary or secondary schools. We hope to be able to help them to improve their standard of English. Our first step is to help them brush up on their grammar. There are no boundaries to the learning of English. So, we have merely grouped our lessons into primary and secondary levels.<br>If you wish to learn English, just follow our lessons. Over time, your standard of English will improve. There are no hard and fast rules here - if indeed your command of English is better than others, then breeze through our current lessons and take up the challenge in our subsequent lessons. Take our current lessons as revision work. But, if you can't get yourself to do that, skip the current lessons and come back when our lessons have progressed to your level.<br>Our English tutor has taught English to students from primary one to secondary five level, both as a home tutor as well as a relief English teacher at school. He knows the different needs of each level of students. However, as English is all about acquiring a general proficiency in the language, there are no boundaries - you learn as much as you can learn comfortably. So, if you are taught something you feel is not ripe yet to be taught to you, don't despair - just hang on in there and your English will improve in no time at all.<br>Free English Lessons are posted on our website as and when they are ready.<br></blockquote>2.According to the posts,the lionnoisy  English very poor<br>learn from Singgie edu sys and costed lot of money to acheve a failing result.<br><br>3.Another reason of migrating to Aussie--u can learn proper ENGLISH!!!<br><br>4.Is this stupid in this era to allow lionnoisy english?<br>what of Singapore world class education?<br><br>if your childrens go to singgie school n come back with such english is this acceptable?</div>
