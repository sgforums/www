            <div class='col-md body'>I just watched the Michael Moore 911 documentary again.<br><br>bin Laden actually did Bush a HUGE favour by giving him an excuse to start a war to divert attention away from his disastrous running of the country.<br><br>Moore also alleged Bush decided to attack Iraq to draw attention away from the real culprits - the Saudi bin Laden family, close friends and business associates of the Bush family (a fact).<br><br>(But thanks to the recent movie "Kingdom", though quite sub-standard story etc, Hollywood reminded us that Saudi is a very real source of terrorists.)<br><br>Furthermore, the 911 documentary's claim that the war was to get Iraq's oil also cannot be disputed.<br><br>In US, a president can get impeached for extra-marital sex where no one got killed. But a president that lies, protects the bin Laden family and sent thousands home from Iraq in body bags goes scot-free to live the rest of his life in money.<br><br>Forgive me for ranting, just very affected by watching the 911 documentary again. At the time of the documentary's release, the Iraq body count of US troops was only in the hundreds. Now it is in the thousands.<br><br>Of course, I am less concerned for the US troops than for the innocent Iraqi civilians terrorised and killed by both sides in the fighting. Nobody is counting their loss.<br><br>But back to Calvin Lee, if you read the last 2 lines of the report, he actually did have a very good reason for NOT wanting to go to Iraq:<br><br>"By November, Lee ..... the end of his Army service, which was originally scheduled for September, the ACLU said.<br><br>But in December, the Army informed Lee that his term of service was being extended and his unit would be deployed to Iraq, ..."<br><br>Basically, he was supposed to ORD. But suddenly that was not only revoked, he will be sent to Iraq.<br><br>And those troops who are already in Iraq are also forcibly having their tour and contracts extended, right?</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Haha, 911 was a big fiasco.  Only the US government thinks that the whole world is comprised of ill informed idiots.<br><br>I remember that day like it was yesterday man.<br><br>Tower 1 and 2 were hit by airplanes and came down.  Tower 7 came down despite not being hit by anything.  And the 911 commission had the gall to claim that fire burnt a modern steel structure down.<br><br>I remember the explosions that went off ahead of the collapsing structure.  I remember the UFO that flew past the towers and going WTF IS THAT?!<br><br>911 was a big farce.  A farce that allowed the US Government to secure much needed funds to enter a war, to pay off the military, maintain global presence.</div>
