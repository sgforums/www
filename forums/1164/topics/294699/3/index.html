The company argued that by 60 Celsius, the soldier would be dead, but they did not take into account the storage and transport of dragonskin, where such high temperatures are easily reached.<br><br>Remember that a bullet-resistant vest for military use must not only be effective, it must remain effective after being stored for many years. How much do you think the US Army would have to pay for climate control chambers to store the body armour to ensure that it wouldn't fall apart? Would it be cost effective for the increase in bullet resistance?<br><br>Also, dragonskin is heavier than the presently issued body armour, so soldiers move slower and suffer more heat injuries.<br><br>In summary, bullet resistance is not the only factor that determines whether a vest is chosen. We should keep in mind other criteria whereby the vest could have been rejected before condemning political interference in the military.</div>
