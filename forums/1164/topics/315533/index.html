              <p>AR 21 is not a good rifle.There are still some problems as reflectd by some forumers here,if their views reflecting the general performances of SAR 21.</p>
              <p>But it is the best SAR 21 SG can offer,based on the CURRENT technology avaiable to SG and funding .</p>
              <p>Some may offer ideas to wait for new technologies mature then SG make a better rifle.No country can afford to wait defending her people.A ready product is much better than a very advanced rifle,but appearing only in the monitor!!</p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: x-small;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">Whether u like to hear or not,SAR 21  combine the features of  ''</span></span></p>

                            Stoner operating system</span>,''</span></p>
              <p>Just to refresh u guys about SAR 21:</p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: x-small;">''...The trigger mechanism is excellent with a relatively light, crisp release 
                            - which we estimate to be around 2.3kg -with little creep or backlash. This 
                            is accomplished via a stiff sliding plate that links the trigger and fire-control 
                            unit, rather than a flexible rod or similar mechanism used in some bullpup 
                            designs that result in a heavy and sluggish trigger pull. <br> <br> The SAR-21 uses what might best be described <span style="color: #ff0000;">as a modified Kalashnikov/ 
                            Stoner operating system</span>, with a long Kalashnikov-style operating rod in 
                            a gas tube over the barrel and a Stoner-style unitary bolt carrier with 
                            firing pin, retained cam pin and bolt. This melding of two proven operating 
                            systems should be extremely reliable and robust. <br> <br> The gas port settings are adjustable without tools to compensate for heavy 
                            use. Adjustment is accomplished by simply lifting the gas regulator and 
                            rotating the adjustment knob to one of its three settings. The bolt itself 
                            is of the conventional rotating type, its two massive lugs locking into 
                            recesses in the barrel extension. The polymer receiver therefore, receives 
                            little stress.....''</span></p>

              <p>What rubbish are you talking about?</p>
              <p>Technology has already matured enough to provide a superior rifle to the basic SAR-21, one can easily see this in the TAR-21 that came out at around the same time as the SAR but was already more advanced with better sights as well as being lighter, as well as having found far more customers overseas.</p>
              <p>Even the H&amp;K G36 had far better sights and was around before the SAR came about.</p>
              <p>You just can't accept facts can you? The SAR-21 is not an advanced AR given even modest firearm technologies, the main reason is because it is cheap compared to other systems and could be produced locally. But there are better rifles out there then the SAR-21 basic for our soldiers. When ST made the SAR, technology was already there to make a better weapon but they didn't and other people did. And it's only later that they decide to play catch up in coming up with variants that the SAF is not using at all while our soldiers are stuck with a less-then-adequate weapon (as opposed to what we could have done).</p>
              <p>LOL, you just can't accept that ST makes only so-so weapons and exists because we have a need for a local arms industry. Despite all your claptrap, it's FAR from being the best in many things.</p>

We do not expect to discover that the guy who runs the coffee shop is also our neighbour, but with a fake mustache and beard.

              <p>What a pity !   SAR21 cud have been a much better rifle. Buying off the shelf  or sticking to M16 or M4 like Malaysia is probably better decision.  SAR21 has no significant improvement over M16 / M4  series.</p>
              <p>After all, battle weary Americans have been using it since 1960s ; so it is still a good weapon.   </p>
