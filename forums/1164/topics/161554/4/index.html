            <div class='col-md body'>Can China really crush a puny lil Singapore?  Lets not forget that if a war with some major power like China breaks out, the FPDA will be activated.   The original intent of the FPDA was really to prevent any possible communist invasion to capture South East Asia.<br><br>South East Asia, was known to the Japs as "Souther Resource Area" (correct me if I got the term wrong.) back in WW2.  They felt they could obtain the resources here to fuel their war in China. If Singapore comes under attack, and should we fall, then Malaysia, Indon, and the rest of South East Asia would be next to go.<br><br>"Syonan-To" was the Japanese key to unlocking South East Asia's rich resources.  And it still remains.<br><br>Can Singapore hold off a large PLA invasion force on its own?  No.  Can the FPDA hold off such a force? Definitely... it will hurt like a bitch.  And the anchoring point of such a FPDA defence, providing much of the command, control, communications and intelligence, is Singapore.  Members of the FPDA know that if such a threat occurs, the SAF would be the Queen of the chessboard.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>It's hard to imagine why China would even consider invading little Singapore - of all places?<br><br>What would the likely scenario be that would lead China to do such a thing?</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Why did japan run all the way down to south east asia back in WW2? Japan was engaged in China, why then come down to South East Asia when they should be focusing their efforts and best troops in China?  Why did they divert some of their veteran troops from china to attack South East Asia?<br><br>Why should we even consider China a threat in the first place?  Okay, I'm not suggesting that they bear hostile intentions towards anyone.  I'm sure their current government is peace loving.<br><br>But examine modern world history.  World War 2 began with Hitler, becoming the dictator.  Japan, an Emperor, Italy, another facist dictator.  In the Soviet Union, a dictator called Stalin.  Iraq had Saddam.   All these threat nation had one thing in common.  Power consolidated under ONE man.<br><br>China is still a communist country.  And it is also one of the fastest growing country.  Both in terms of military and economically.  As the economy grows, the need to safeguard it grows, in turn, defence spending, and military.  Because it is still a communist country, all its power can still be consolidated under one person, any person.  A coup might see a rapid change in power.  Those of you have been to china will see that their propaganda power is SUPERB.  It is easy for them to unite its citizens and rally them towards a cause.  What if the next PRC president doesnt want to play nice?<br><br>This is why US is wary of China's growth.  They didn't expect China to grow like that.  And a powerful communist china, to them, is a bomb waiting to explode.<br><br>Don't be surprised if u suddenly see the non-democratic nations in the Middle East suddenly start being forced into a "regime-change."  If I were the US, I would take action against these smaller armed forces now, secure the middle east and build up to face a potentially tough adversary in the form of China.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>60 yrs ago, with the French and the brits engaged in Europe, the japs believed they could just walk down and take over the resources in S E Asia if they could destroy the Americans in the pacific, and they did just that after pearl harbor. Today, I believe China is fully aware that military takeover of any of the countries in S E Asia will not be a walkover. Their war with Vietnam, the present standoff with Taiwan and the American current experience in Iraqi should continue to be good lessons.<br><br>Chinese communist party is different from the north Korean communist party and the previous communist party of the soviet union which had extra legal authorities in the state enabling a single person to control the state. Ccp derives its power from its position in the state. The central military committee and the politburo standing committee are The power of ccp and it is not held by one person. Neither Mao nor Deng had The power, they could only exercise great influence but could not be a dictator, even when they held the positions of party chairman and chairman of the central military committee which essentially control the armed forces.<br><br>Of course a coup can change everything, but believe me a coup within a communist party is more difficult than in a democratic county. That is why communists are so frightening.<br><br>But the changes of leaderships within ccp over the last 25 yrs, fr Zhou, to Jiang to Hu, fr Ju Rongji to Wen Jia Bao showed the passing or sharing of power within the party. I am not worried about any Chinese dictator, I am more worried about the communist party taking a hardline.<br><br>Militarily it will be years before china can project its forces across the region, even if EU ends its weapon embargo, any military build up responding to china would only benefit the US weapon suppliers.<br><br>The real threat from China comes from Chinese nationalism. The rise of China certainly appeals to the millions of overseas chinese living in south east asian countries, who share the same history, culture and language, treated as second class citizens at home. How can we continue to maintain our way of life, currently flooded with everything cheap from china and bombarded with values from hollywood. What values do we hold as Singaporean, against foreign influence? How can we continue to be proud being a citizen of singapore, which many ppl think equals PAP? I am a firm believer that migrating does not solve the problem.<br></div>

There is no dispute that Mao had done much to the poor peasants in china but he is remembered only as the founding father of PRC, like Sunyetsen in ROC. Already Deng did not follow everything that Mao said and today Deng is remembered only as the leader who opened up china leading to current prosperity. There is not much the current young chinese could remember about the past, many don't even recognise FEC. (except for the history on WW2 and that part of history on why Hong Kong and Macao came under foreign rules).<br><br>There is no doubt that US is wary of any country that can match their influence, be it china or EU. My concern is where do we, singaporean, together all other countries in the region stand, in the middle of all these. how is US handling the rising china will surely affect us. if US choose to confront china we will all end up in the cold war era again and who will benefit?<br><br>personally I prefer a balance of power which include China, India, united korea, Japan and US rather than a US dominant Asia. Once there is a military balance in the region, all other countries will not be forced to take side.</div>
