They are still stuck to a 2-dimensional doctrine, like a chess game.<br><br>What a air-portable 155mm gives us is a gun that is capable of deploying to provide fire support rapidly.  Where a traditional SPG or FH would have to trudge through, the Chinook can simply carry it there. That is our third-dimension.

They lost the amphibious assault on Taiwan and therefore ROC remains in Taiwan today.<br><br>PLA came into existance only after 1947 and there were no land battles between between the PLA and the army of ROC, (there is no taiwanese army), only artilery duels, air battles and exchanges of balloons. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br><br>PLA is still basically a land forces, its airforce, navy and its ability to launch amphibious assault were never proven.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>In theory, PLA achieved all or part of their objectives in the:<br><br>Korean War (1950's)<br>Sino-Indian War (1960's)<br>Sino-Vietnam War (1970's)<br><br>........................................................................................................<br><br>In Korea, the PLA were at first victorious against the US/Allied forces. Then it started losing but still managed to keep North Korea from being overrun. Though it suffered massive casualties, it was a victory as a poorly-armed but well-motivated peasant army was able to hold back mighty western armies.<br><br>But its weakness and inability to defeat a western power was also evident.<br><br>The end of the Korean War was the start of PLA's 1st modernization.<br><br>........................................................................................................<br><br>In the Sino-Indian War, Nehru provoked the PLA into action by instigating border clashes and making verbal threats of using military force to invade China - against the advice of his of the Indian army generals.<br><br>Therefore, when the PLA duly invaded, the Indian Army was unprepared (or so it was claimed) and suffered humiliating defeat.<br><br>Right from the start China stated that its objectives were the "teach India a lesson" and not to gain any territory. On its own accord, the PLA withdrew.<br><br>IMO, it was a shrewd move as China emerged a victor that was also gracious enough to return all territory and POWs. Had they prolonged the war or invaded deeper, the PLA may have a difficult time extracting itself.<br><br>........................................................................................................<br><br>In the Sino-Vietnam War again China stated right from the start that its objectives were to "teach Vietnam a lesson" and not to hold any territory.<br><br>But the PLA ended up suffering twice the casualties than the Vietnamese.<br><br>The PLA certainly did not win this war but the PLA wasn't overrun or chased out of Vietnam. It was just to costly in terms of casualty to invade any further. They also realised it pointless as the Vietnamese weren't scared of war. Civilian Vietnamese women and children were sacrificing themselves to deliver bombs to the PLA just as they did against the Americans a decade ago.<br><br>Resistance was intense and determined.<br><br>Only "lesson" learnt was that the PLA needed to be revamped (and never touch Vietnam again).<br><br>The end of the Sino-Vietnam War was the start of PLA 2nd modernization.<br><br>........................................................................................................<br><br>The PLA never attempted an invasion of the mainland ROC, period.<br><br>There were artillery duels in the late forties. The KMT held a couple of islands that are VERY NEAR China but VERY FAR from Taiwan. So the PLA were shelling those islands. The US Pacific fleet was nearby to ensure Taiwan's safety.</div>

Things changed radically with the North Korean invasion of South Korea on June 25,1950, thus triggering the Korean War. At this point, allowing a total Communist victory over Chiang became politically impossible in the United States, and President Harry S. Truman ordered the U.S. 7th Fleet into the Taiwan straits, ending any possibility for a successful Communist invasion."<br><br>Two things are clear,<br><br>1) US was not interested in depending ROC in Taiwan, not until south korea was attacked. 7th fleet was ordered into taiwan straits for political reason in US and it so happened a communist victory in china was against the US interests.<br><br>2) Korean war was started by the communists in north korea. US did not launched the korean war. US is a peace loving country, they never start any war with anybody until their own interests is at stake.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Once the intel become declassified,  Powell will get the blame. Invasion of iraq and occupation brings US involvement and deaths, now they cannot get out for many years.  They have to feed iraq for many years.  The battle sunnis and shilites will go on with support from iran and others.  Live in iraq is like, not knowing who is going to get blown up sooner or later.  one explosion can kill hundreds.  scary man.  but sympathy goes to those innocents having to lose families and homes since US invaded.  If not their live still goes on with their love ones under saddam.  which do they prefer?<br><br></div>

That's why they're busily invading everyone in the name of protecting their interests.<br><br>The Korean War is a war to determine who rules Korea. China, US, Soviet etc should have all stayed out of that war, but that's impossible to expect.<br><br>So if another Korea War erupts, all the big powers should just stay the hell out and let them slog it out and settle the matter themselves.
