If they ever done so, it is A WHITE LIE. </div></blockquote>Absolutely agree, and who is saying japan will not invade asia again?? and USA is a peace loving nation??<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by equlus84:</div><div class="quote_body">Â… Just like Japanese harrassed it's neighbours since 1500s, China since Han period already start a couple of violent expeditions into their neighbours land. Do u knoe that in Vietnam, there is this festival that celebrates the driving out of the Song dynasty soldiers abt 1000 yrs ago? Do u knoe that emporer of Sui dynasty start 3 long and bloody campaigns that range for abt 50 years to capture the Gao Li (korean) empire! But of course most Chinese historians from past to present gloss over such campaigns. </div></blockquote> Brilliant knowledge of historical facts, but you donÂ’t need to go back as far as 1000 yrs of history, as recent as in the 1500, 7 to 10 millions of native Indians were reduced to 250,000 today in the form of nation building by the white American, how should we portray the American then?<br>Learn this from Dr. Mahathir, Â“we have had dealings with China for 1800 yrsÂ…and we were never conquered by China. We started trading with the Portuguese in 1509. By 1511, we were conquered by the PortugueseÂ….China is only 2000 miles from Malaysia. The Portuguese  came 8000 miles and they conquered us.Â”<br>Today we are talking about American carrier groups in asia, 6000 miles from home, sailing along the coasts of China, and we portray china as the thread??<br>It is not just knowing historical facts, but pls read the events using the same standards.<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by equlus84:</div><div class="quote_body">Bcos the emporer is regarded as the mandate and China was like in the middle of the Universe! Therefore Chinese being influenced by such thinkings, bcomes racist in nature by claiming those non-Han as barbarians. But why no ppls complain abt these events of wars throughout history, because the authorities then cleverly linked the conquest to "taming and subduing the uncivilized", and most importantly link it to the ruler. If it was the emporer's and heaven's will, it is the people's will! </div></blockquote> China only claimed to be the middle kingdom, not in the middle of the Universe. Chinese reverence for the universe has resulted in the many deities, if you are aware. Chinese emperors only considered themselves sons of heaven, but never the heaven itself.<br>The dynasties of the Han people always had skirmishes with the nomads in the north, and the Mongolians and the Manchurians actually conquered and ruled china. But the Mongolian yuan dynasty did not last two generations because they ruled china, and the world, then including asia and part of Europe with swords on the horse backs; but the Manchurians, the qing dynasty, rules china for over 400 yrs because they adopted the Chinese systems of writing, farmingÂ….It is not wrong to say that many uncivilized minorities were subdued, at least for peaceful co existence!! if you compare this part of history with that of America, at least there is still a large population of Mongolian and Manchurian around. The cheyenne, the mohigans..all perished...<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by equlus84:</div><div class="quote_body">Secondly, if u happen to visit China's military websites, u will be horrified by the level of facist, racism in those forum,. Â…..of CHina?Those things like peasant riots which is on the rise is never reported on CCTV u knoe? There was once I happen to see a China websites that claim SARS start in Singapore and we sabo them by spreading it to them!</div></blockquote> I do not doubt there are propaganda and whatever nonsense there are in China on the websites, but I am not blind to the propaganda from the other sides, whether it is the US or anybody whoever they think they are. My position is clear, I take no side between the US and China, and Singapore should never be sucked in to take side for the US. I do not portray the US as the possible aggressor even though their carriers groups are right here in Asia, I cannot see any reason why we should portray china as the Â“possible futureÂ” thread to the region. May be someday when china submarines begin to surface outside the coast of America or china navy having a base in cuba, then I might change my mind. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Ok, Sgdiehard, I not saying that China should not be powerful or wat, I actually feel a multi polar one is definitely better than a unipolar one. BUT, with China's current behaviour and attitude towards interacting and diplomacy with the neighbours is a far cry from being polite. Do u know the Chinese claims that in history, they ruled the spratlys since Tang dynasty! LOL! Those islands are veri much near to borneo or Sulawesi, any the ppls of those islands are known to be good navigators, sailors and fisherman. Yes, the ppls may not have huge and extravegent vessels like Zheng He's but those islands are known to shelters for fishermen during seasonal winds, thus isn't the Islanders chance of exploring the islands and harbouring there higher than those of medieval China? So do u know why those islands suddenly 'discovered' by Tang men as China claimed? Bcos they have OIL!! But hey just look at how they settle the dispute with the 9 other parties, HIGH- HANDED siah. Refused to let the ICJ handle the issue and worst of all, CHINA WANTS TO DEAL WITH THESE 9 DISPUTEES AS SEPARATE ENTITIES!!!!Worst of all they actually planted naval markers on one of the islands claimed by Philippines, Philippines and all these small ASEAN neighbours kana BULLY BIG TIME. They want to keep the military options alive. That's 'friendly' and 'diplomat' perhaps by CCP standards. So I put this to u, if Ghenhis Khan once conquer more than half the known civilised world of 1300 can the Mongolian government claim those territories today? China has always been banking on the world war 2 issues to justify it's rapid modernisation and their nationalism education has morbidly become facist education. The repeated rhetoric of their country being bullied for thousands of years and the need to unifiy the 'Hua Xia" civilisation has instilled a high level of hatre, jealousy, anger and vegeneful mentality in their present day youths. Lets not forget WW2 Hilter also wanted to 'unify' the Bavarian territories, one after the other....... Austria........Sudenteland.......Czechoslovakia...........Poland............ Remember how the Japanese rapidly industrialise and yearn to join the 'big boys' club nations. ALL THESE CAUSED WAR. So I fear the day Singapore was 'once part of the Ming Kingdom'. Also, remember, father is a murderer does'nt mean son is a murderer........ 1 day ago he/she is not a thief doesn't mean he/she will not steal forever. Thus I can only say....... Singapore, prepare for a rough ride ahead. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_neutral.gif" alt="Neutral" title="Neutral">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_idea.gif" alt="Idea" title="Idea"></div>
