            <div class='col-md body'>Strong or weak presence is rather relative and there are different dimensions.<br><br>From another angle, does US depend on its military to assert its power, does it exercise its diplomatic influence to exert its presence, or does it make use of its economic power to make its presence known?<br><br>Outside of Japan and Korea we donÂ’t see strong US military presence.<br><br>Military showdown will not develop if there are economic exchanges, military showdown can be avoided only through regular diplomatic contacts. A showdown between a weak nation facing a significantly stronger force will only result in the use of extreme measure, in the case of North Korea, China, Pakistan and India, it will be nuclear weapons!<br><br>Besides, there will be no peace in the region if there are suicide bombings every now and then against American targets. The greater the US Â“presenceÂ”, the greater the risks of terrorists attack.<br><br>Asia has come under great influence of the US since WW2, but how many countries in Asia are truly pro-American? Not sure about Thailand and the Philippines, donÂ’t think the Vietnamese like the Yankees, and definitely not Malaysia and Indonesia. And if US continue to take China as their potential enemy, they may soon realize that they actually do not have many friends in Asia.<br><br>and how well are things americans received by the Asians now? I now have more choice than hamburger and kentucky, like ramian and jiaozi (ginza), and I now watch more Korean, Japanese movies and tv than those from Hollywood.<br><br>IMF, under the US has lost the trust of Asian businessmen in US as a savior in a financial crisis. The war in iraq has also put US in a bad light among the muslim countries in the region.<br><br>There is a lot the US need to do in their presence in Asia, putting a few more carrier groups will not help, trying to counter the rise of China will not serve any purpose.<br><br></div>

We need china to stop supporting north korea and to do that we need to make china feel comfortable that a united korea will not be another part of the american containment of China, and politically it will not be a yes man to the yankee. Only then can we be realistic in hoping for a unification of korea, even if it means unification by force.<br><br></div>

ThatÂ’s why, you can see the biggest banks and many strategy asserts are open to foreign investment, and oversea investors can virtually invest almost every industries in PRC and sell goods there. but even look at todayÂ’s japan, itÂ’s still basically closed to outsiders.<br><br>So how could you see closely, then find todayÂ’s China is like Japan just before WWII?<br><br></div></blockquote>China has two roads to choose.Let the CMC hawks take control and we won't see a progressive, prosperous China.Therefore it is vital that Hu be given the full support to reform as he sees fit.<br><br>What I was trying to portray is China in the other road, beset by internal strife and using a conflict to attempt to unite the people once more.This has been done throughout the centuries..</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hmmmm...... to Sgdiehard, wat u said that China has no internal strife? isit? Now maybe not, but in a decade or so might have.<br><br>First of all, no nation on this planet can ever declare that they are a eternal, forever peace loving civilisation or nation. If they ever done so, it is A WHITE LIE. I know, Chinese leadership promise that they will never want to dominate the world, but, do u believe that 100%? Of, course, with their current economical and military strength still relatively infant, they can go abt trumpeting that! And u claim that China never laid dirty thoughts on the territories of other nations, u must be kidding! Just like Japanese harrassed it's neighbours since 1500s, China since Han period already start a couple of violent expeditions into their neighbours land. Do u knoe that in Vietnam, there is this festival that celebrates the driving out of the Song dynasty soldiers abt 1000 yrs ago? Do u knoe that emporer of Sui dynasty start 3 long and bloody campaigns that range for abt 50 years to capture the Gao Li (korean) empire! But of course most Chinese historians from past to present gloss over such campaigns.Bcos the emporer is regarded as the mandate and China was like in the middle of the Universe! Therefore Chinese being influenced by such thinkings, bcomes racist in nature by claiming those non-Han as barbarians. But why no ppls complain abt these events of wars throughout history, because the authorities then cleverly linked the conquest to "taming and subduing the uncivilized", and most importantly link it to the ruler. If it was the emporer's and heaven's will, it is the people's will!<br><br>Secondly, if u happen to visit China's military websites, u will be horrified by the level of facist, racism in those forum, u will also marvel at the success of China's propaganda. One really wonder wat they learn in schools. They literally swear, curse, insult, and hurl vulgarities at almost any nation on this planet, that also includes us. They are not like us at least cool down and do comparison on military gears, their there to show off their nationalism and their flair in vulgarities. Of, course u may say China forumers do not represent the government, but one day these guys are going to replace the old in the government or lead their army, would they be as peaceful as now. I have seen many China websites openly admiring Hilter and his fascist behaviour. Many praise him for uniting the Bavarian race and bring his civilisation to the next highest level! Scary rite! If he is in Singapore, confirm jail liao!!<br>And there was once I chance upon this Chinese website that talk abt our RSN, my god...... almost 9 pages of insults and bashing! But one thing surprised me, was when a few cool- headed forumers start to make comparison of our ship and their, and came upon the conclusion that RSS ships are generally better han PLAN, the thread was banned!! Soon it was DELETED!! U knoe why? U got the China internet police to thank! China government have been using the internet as a powerful leash to control the ppls unknowingly. The rising of social disparity(AIDS, rural urban migration issues, ehtnic unfairness) , economical gap and other problems have been casting an ugly shadow on the CCP. To divert the ppls attention,way form these 'time bombs' they set up these forums to allow ppls to express their feelings to the military, as their military is deem one of their prideful things, on one hand, ppl think they are given more freedom to voice their views,....more'democratic', but the CCP has the last laugh as they are controlling them. Do u knoe CCP also like to control news that flows into and out of CHina?Those things like peasant riots which is on the rise is never reported on CCTV u knoe? There was once I happen to see a China websites that claim SARS start in Singapore and we sabo them by spreading it to them!</div>
