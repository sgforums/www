            <div class='col-md body'>China is a country with 1.3 billion ppl and there are many peasants, many have not been out of china, no ordinary citizens serve in the military and their knowledge is definitely nothing compared to an average male singaporean. If there are 40,000 idiots or 1% of our population in singapore, there are 13 million idiots there!!<br><br>why are ppl worked up by some stupid remarks which has not substance at all?? or, the same kinds having a getting together? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hello,<br><br>Just a note for some equally ignorant forumers here, alot of US-made weapon spare parts are produced in China as well. Some of the weapons in our inventory have spares coming from our beloved PRC u know?? Why? The US bosses want more profit from their weapon selling business, thus decided to sub-con some "minor" parts to some reliable PRC sub-con like Noricon.<br><br>Singaporeans must be prepared to face a super fast rising China. Looking at the global business intregation today, China is fast building up as a node in the global businiess network. Some of the vug US manufacturers even think of setting up warehousing operation in China; that really bother Singapore as it threaten our basic buiness - shipping and warehousing.<br><br>A lot of young people are quite "disenaged" from the real world, still there are alot of young singaporean, regardless of race, think that China is piece of shit. This is a very dangerous idea, as we have totally under-estimate our true competitor - China. Some of her best engineers and scientists are running our most prized A-star R&amp;D labs. What is our young Singaporean doing??<br><br>Time to wake up liao.<br><br></div>
