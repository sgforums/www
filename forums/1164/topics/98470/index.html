            <div class='col-md body'>I liken the NDU to UK's SBS (Special Boat Squadron).  Very low profile. Some have never heard of them. But when push comes to shove, they deliver.  I have this military magazine somewhere which describes the relations between SAS &amp; SBS.  Saying that SAS are the glory boys.  They get all the fame &amp; honour &amp; glory, but when it comes to delivering, they screw up time &amp; time again.  SBS however gets the job done but maintain low profile.<br><br>Kinda reminds me of NDU. Low profile but when they need to deliver, they do.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>In the past, Guards do not have a distinctive beret but wear the Infantry green beret. They were also under HQ Infantry. To differentiate them from normal infantry (SIR) and to distinct their status as elite infantry, they are given a "Guards" tab to be worn on their shoulder. Also in the past, Guards have a slightly higher "entry" requirement like PES A only, min education level and eye-sight.... In the past, hardly see any specs in a Guards unit. But now with more and more enlistees being myopic and more people with A levels and diploma, all these have changed.<br><br>When Guards are seperated into a seperate formation under HQ Guards. They have a new and distinct khaki brown beret with backing behind the crest. However they retained the "Guards" Tab.<br><br>The role of guards have evolved over the years, they used to be infantry which are supposedly fitter and more able compared to SIR units. Also have a rappelling role with more flexible heli-insert options.<br><br>But now more like RDF and "Marines" type role with specialist in heli and seabourne insertions. Also they have more mobile and powerful weapons like the LSV.<br><br>The Commando all along distincguished by their red beret. When in No. 1, No. 3 or smart 4 can see red beret. In SBO/FBO you should be able to distinguish them by their airborne wings and dagger.<br><br></div>

Also, in the old Tamasek green uniform days, they wore a different colour belt to differentiate themselves. There were no shoulder guards tabs then.<br><br>Guardsmen used to perform Istana guard duties as well, like the British counterparts. Now role taken over by MPs.</div>
