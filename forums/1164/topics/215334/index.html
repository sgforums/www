This restricts US and Australian forces to training and logistics.<br><br>However, it is believed that these terms are sufficiently elastic to allow intimate US and Australian involvement in Philippines military operations, with the only proviso that the final military action must be taken by Philippines soldiers. They can, however, be accompanied by Americans or Australians.<br><br>Dulmatin, the bomb technician who planned and carried out the 2002 Bali attacks, has a $US10 million ($13 million) bounty on his head, offered by the US Government.<br>Patek, who recruited the suicide bombers to carry out the 2002 Bali bombings, which killed 202 people including 88 Australians, reportedly died in a shootout with Filipino soldiers last month.<br><br>Philippines security forces claimed that Patek, who had a $US1million ($1.3 million) bounty on his head, "died from the wounds he suffered" after forces attacked an Abu Sayyaf camp on Jolo. But a senior Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade source said Patek was thought to be alive.<br><br>........................................<br><br>The Australian SAS contingent was chosen because of its expertise in small, fast boats.<br><br>The SAS used rigid inflatables of the kind used in the interception of the Norwegian Tampa refugee boat in 2001.<br><br>Under an expanded counter-terrorist defence assistance program, Australia is to supply 30 vessels to the Philippines Navy.<br><br>It will supply training and maintenance support for the life of the boats.</blockquote>2.<strong><a href="http://www.theaustralian.news.com.au/story/0,20867,20576810-601,00.html" rel="nofollow">Special forces wage war by stealth</a></strong><br><blockquote>ANALYSIS<br>Greg Sheridan<br>October 14, 2006<br>A SMALL team of about 20 Australian Special Air Service soldiers has been helping track down Abu Sayyaf and Jemaah Islamiah terrorists in the southern Philippines.<br><br>The soldiers have been notionally in joint patrols with Filipino military personnel but in truth the Australians are leading the efforts they are involved with.<br><br>For the past couple of months a spasmodically ferocious effort has been waged in Mindanao, in particular on the island of Jolo, to eradicate the ASG, an al-Qa'ida affiliated terror group of extreme violence and cruelty.<br><br>The SAS campaign is the nearest the Australian special forces have come to direct combat operations in Southeast Asia since the Vietnam War. The SAS was involved in East Timor but that was peace-keeping rather than combat.<br><br>Under The Philippines' constitution, foreign forces are not allowed to have permanent bases or engage in direct combat on Philippines' soil. This has hampered the US, which has the broadest and deepest military relationship with The Philippines.<br>................................</blockquote><strong><a href="http://www.murdoconline.net/" rel="nofollow">Aussie SAS 13.10.2006</a></strong></div>
