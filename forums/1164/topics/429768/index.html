              <p class="spip">This article was first published in the Defense &amp; Security Analysis magazine, Vol. 22, No. 1, pp. 73-88, March 2006</p>
              <p class="spip">INTRODUCTION</p>
              <p class="spip">The Gulf region currently remains the largest defence 
              procurement market in the world. With tens of billions of dollars spent 
              annually on highly lethal and technological weapons, it is a very high 
              value-added market for Western defence industries.</p>
              <p class="spip">The Middle East, which extends from the Maghreb, through
               the Mashrek to the Persian (Arabian) Gulf, is far from being 
              homogenous, particularly in terms of its armaments market. However, a 
              distinction must be made between the weight and the characteristics of 
              the major defence markets in North Africa, the Near East and the rest of
               the Middle East.</p>
              <p class="spip">Traditionally, Russia has had the monopoly on major 
              Algerian Defence contracts. With the end of the arms embargo, a new 
              Libyan defence market is emerging, but has yet to come into its own. 
              Israel and Egypt are in a league of their own, because of massive US 
              military aid received following the signing of the 1979 peace accords : 
              approximately US$2.3 billion for the former and US$1.3 - US$1.8 billion 
              for the latter . Jordan, since signing a peace treaty with Israel in 
              1994, is in a similar position. Syria finds itself virtually excluded 
              from the international procurement market, with the exception of the 
              sale of Russian ground-to-air missiles following Bashar el Assad’s visit
               to Moscow in January 2005. Conventional Syrian weapons are nearly 
              exclusively Soviet, dating from the first half of the 1980s.</p>
              <p class="spip">The oil monarchies of the Gulf Co-operation Council 
              (GCC) - Bahrain, Kuwait, Oman, Qatar, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab 
              Emirates (UAE) - make up the core of the Middle East defence market, 
              with just under 40 percent of the world’s total weapons sales during the
               1990s. Combined, its ratio of military spending to Gross Domestic 
              Product (GDP) is the highest in the world and, on average, is above 6 
              per cent. This ratio is two times greater than in industrialised 
              countries, where the average is closer to 2.4 per cent. .. ...</p>
