LALEE is an integrated airborne surveillance and communications system designed to provide continuous temporal coverage over a very large area. Providing a task group operating in the littorals with continuous surveillance from the air with this class of UAV will be considerably cheaper than operating current generation of surveillance and communications platforms.Below are quotes and sources.<br>1.  <a href="http://www.dsta.gov.sg/home/DisplayPage/ContentPage10.asp?id=829&lt;br%20/&gt;&lt;br%20/&gt;" rel="nofollow">http://www.dsta.gov.sg/home/DisplayPage/ContentPage10.asp?id=829<br><br></a><br>while four Northrop Grumman E-2C Hawkeye airborne early-warning aircraft monitor air targets. However, both Maj Gen Lim and Prof Lui talk of rethinking such solutions.<br><br>"We will have to look at replacing the E-2C, which has been with us for 14 years. I think the time has come," says Maj Gen Lim. "There are a few options to look at. There could be completely new ways of meeting the requirement. It could evolve into two different sets of platforms to meet expanded operational capabilities."<br><br>One option is a system like the LALEE, studied for three years by a team under Lui. This unmanned air vehicle is described by Lui as "an integrated airborne surveillance and communications system to provide continuous temporal and very large spatial coverage". This would "provide a task group operating in the littorals with continuous surveillance from the air [at a cost] considerably cheaper than operating current-generation surveillance and communications platforms".<br>. 2. <a href="http://www.flightinternational.com/Articles/2004/05/04/181242/Singapore+details+UAV+programmes.html&lt;br%20/&gt;&lt;br%20/&gt;" rel="nofollow">http://www.flightinternational.com/Articles/2004/05/04/181242/Singapore+details+UAV+programmes.html<br><br></a><br>DATE:04/05/04<br>SOURCE:Flight International<br>Singapore details UAV programmes<br>Images of single fuselage vehicle displayed at conference; overall strategy to be based on "swarm and proliferation"<br>Singapore is continuing work on its Lalee long-endurance unmanned air vehicle requirement, but is some years from delivering a capability, says Maj Alfred Fox, director of the Singapore ministry of defence's newly established future systems directorate. To perform airborne early warning, maritime and ground surveillance, and communications relay duties, the high-altitude system will work alongside Singapore's existing military surveillance satellite programme.<br>Initial Lalee concepts released in 2001 were based on a twin tail- boom design, giving rise to speculation that the air vehicle would be a derivative of the Israel Aircraft Industries (IAI)/EADS Heron/Eagle 1 system. However, during a 21 April presentation to the Unmanned Vehicles Asia Pacific conference in Sydney,<strong> Fox displayed images of a single fuselage air vehicle with a large, underslung phased-array radar. The images indicate a radar configuration with a surveillance range of around 150km (80nm).<br>Fox says Singapore's overall UAV development strategy is based on "swarm and proliferation", </strong> and that its planned Fantail and Skyblade systems provide the most immediate focus. The army plans to acquire the Singapore Technologies Aerospace Fantail vertical take-off and landing UAV (VTUAV) to meet a requirement to conduct urban operations.<br><br>to be continued.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Burt Rutan is involved in LALEE!!<br><br>LALEE OF Sg<br><blockquote> The project acronym is LALEE, which stands for low-altitude long-enduring endurance, but the low is a relative term, meaning that this platformÂ’s projected cruising altitude of <strong>60,000 feet is lower than that of satellite surveillance systems. </strong>Endurance is self-explanatory, meaning a long dwell time such as is already demonstrated by the Northrop Grumman Global Hawk unmanned aerial vehicle. Long-enduring is a reference to the DSOÂ’s aim that this platform should be<strong> in service for 30 years.......</strong><br><br>Prof. Lui Pao Chuen. He showed delegates attending the C4I conference a twin-boom design with (naturally) a long wing. Little has been said since, although a government minister did acknowledge last November that the LALEE was a potential E-2C Hawkeye replacement in the Republic of Singapore Air Force (RSAF).<br><br>Unlike the Global Hawk, Predator-B and U-2, which rule todayÂ’s high-altitude skies, the LALEE is a twin-boom, twin-engine design. The two powerplants are for redundancy, but also to provide increased electrical power to the sensors. The sensor payloads would presumably be modular and interchangeable, as they are on the Global Hawk and the U-2.<br><br>In the early stages of this project, <a href="http://www.dso.org.sg/home/collaborations/collaborations_overseas.aspx" rel="nofollow"> <strong>the DSO(of Sg)</strong></a>engaged maverick U.S. designer <strong>Burt Rutan as a consultant. RutanÂ’s company, Scaled Composites,</strong> has developed its own high-altitude, twin-boom, twin-engine design, the Proteus. It is not known whether Rutan continues to advise the DSO on the LALEE, which is somewhat largerÂ–approximately t<strong>he wingspan and fuselage length of a Boeing 737, and with an mtow of about 15 tons.<br><br></strong>The intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance (ISR) community will be watching the LALEE development with interest, since <strong>it could potentially offer an alternative to the current U.S. dominance of the HALE market,</strong> at a time when interest in these platforms is taking off around the world. For instance, at the UAV conference earlier this week, EADS InternationalÂ’s senior vice president Gen. Jean-Georges Brevot noted that France could be expected to introduce a HALE UAV between 2010 and 2015.</blockquote>fr<br><a href="http://www.ainonline.com/Publications/asian/asian_04/d3_dronep3.html" rel="nofollow"> Singapore/EADS may do spy drone--by Chris Pocock</a><br><br><strong>Who is Burt Rutan</strong><br><img src="http://www.scaled.com/images/title-burt-branson_spaceships.jpg"><br>fr <a href="http://www.scaled.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.scaled.com/</a><br>Wah!July 27, 2005:  Sir Richard Branson (Founder, Virgin Group of Companies)  	 and Rutan to form "The Spaceship Company<br><br><strong>Rutan involved in B2 </strong><br><img src="http://image2.sina.com.cn/jc/2003-12-20/U37P27T1D172318F3DT20031220094313.jpg"><br><br>fr   <a href="http://www.scaled.com/projects/index.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.scaled.com/projects/index.html</a><br><br>So Sg may not be the best .But sure we are working with the best!<br><br>This posting also appears in MAV and UAV thread.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>What is LALEE<br><blockquote>:38. A UAV designed for a continuous coverage mission will require the operating cost per flying hour to be very low, below US$1,000, to be affordable. A continuous coverage station will require the flying of about 10,000 hours per year. The capital cost of acquiring the platform and payload, say at US$50m will be overtaken by the operations and maintenance cost after five years of operations. The US Navy is studying the MRE (Multi-Role Endurance) UAV to perform this mission. We have just completed a 3 year long study of LALEE which is an integrated airborne surveillance and communications system designed to provide continuous temporal coverage over a very large area. Providing a task group operating in the littorals with continuous surveillance from the air with this class of UAV will be considerably cheaper than operating current generation of surveillance and communications platforms. The technology is there but whether Navies will to want to invest in this class of UAV will depend on their perceived need for a continuous coverage platform.</blockquote><strong><a href="http://www.mindef.gov.sg/nps/technical/paper1.htm" rel="nofollow">Text of Address by Prof Lui Pao Chuen, </a></strong>Chief Defence Scientist,Singapore.<br>Naval Platform Technology Seminar 10th May 2001</div>
