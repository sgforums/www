The manufacturer (CIS) has corrected the defects of the Ultimax (falling drum-magazine, double feeding and other malfunctions) which made it an "unwanted" weapon in the 7th SRC when we were deployed in Maguindanao.<br><br>The advantages of the Ultimax include the following:<br>CIS has a local counterpart company (Floro Arms) which assist the repairs and parts replacement.<br><br>We wont be too dependent of the M855 SS109 linked ammo which the Arsenal is not capable of producing .<br><br><strong>It out-performs the M249 (shot grouping capacity) out to 500m. It should be noted that the  Singapore Shooting Team  is the consistent champion in the LMG Category of the Australian Army Skill At Arms Meeting that we participated recently. I had seen how the NZ, Aus Army, US AMU and USMC Shooting Team of Quantico  (all were using M249 except NZ team which used the M240B) were "routed" by the Singaporeans. We were using the brand new M249 from SEB, PA. Tigok rin kami sa LMG Category!</strong><br><br>Perhaps, we can request from Singapore, our ASEAN neighbor, to design a 1:9 twist bull barrel for the Ultimax so that we can use either the SS109 and the M193 ball.<br><br>We immediately submitted our observations and recommendations to the CGPA himself when we arrived in December. I hope there will be positive action very soon.<br><br>The Army guys (especially the office boys) who are responsible for the procurement of our weapon systems must really rethink about their options. Ultimax or the Minimi? Nasubukan ko na yan... ang iba, nabola or nagpabola lang sa dealer. Hoooooooooah!<br></blockquote>And here another from another PA soldier:<br><blockquote>Yup, totally agree with wat is written as above. The Ultimax is both cheaper and lighter. I have the privilege of firing before both the Ultimax100 and the Minimi before. The ultimax is light enough in terms of weight and recoil for a typical Asian soldier to fir in the standing shoulder postioin and the high kneel position. It is also good in Urban operations as u do not need to line the windows with sandbags to support the weapon when firing. In tactics wise, the Ultmiax gunner that is organic to the infantry section can take part in the "room capturing" role, instead of just being used as fire support. This is my personal experience. During one of the 300m range test, my company mate did a spectacular shoot being the highest hit rate among the LMG gunners. In fact, he overshot the marksman criteria by a lot. The secret is in the Ultimax100. He deliberately deprive the barrel of gas by setting the gas regulator to a low number at the same time ensuring it doesn't have stoppages. Thus he could shoot the rounds out one by one!! Coupled with the low recoil, he easily got the highest score<br></blockquote>In conclusion, Ultimax is still the lightest and most controllable( i.e. most accurate) LMG in the world.<br><br>The SAR21 LMG, will it be as controllable and reliable as Utilmax???<br><br>I doubt so, so far HB rifle seldom perform well as a LMG.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>great discussion on the U100.. but there is not much discussion on the feeding system of a SAW.... the drum mag we have on the U100 cannot be loaded FULL without a special tool ! , and I have not been issued one in the service But so far, what I have heard is the drum is not very reliable and prone to jam in real word situation.  Granted the Mk4 now takes the Beta Cmag! but from my buddies from Iraq and the recent report of the Beta... it did not perform very well in dirty and dusty conditions!  the last thing you want is a jam drum!!!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_sad.gif" alt="Sad" title="Sad"><br><br>As we have seen all SAW design recently and before have alternative feeding which is belt fed... look at the Isrealis, HK, etc etc...<br><br>HAve played with the M249 and defeintly the weight is much too much for us Asians.  U100 felt so light from a SAW perspective and handling is defeinty very good except for those stupid Blanks SAF kept feeding us.  the belt fed and the higher rate of fire from the Hks, M249 does comes in handy in a surpessrive fire type situation.<br><br>Hope to see Singapore SAW being use by the USMC.... but I wish they would have looked into the feeding system, heavier barrel ( 1:9 twist or 1:7 ) to shoot the M855 .<br><br>DaveC</div>

The loading system could be improved but certainly not to a belt/box fed system, which has more then its own fair share of problems with fouling and links getting twisted. In fact it is the ability to feed from normal mags that is one of the plus points of the Ultimax.</div>
