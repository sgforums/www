            <div class='col-md body'>Singapore should never give up the ultimax100 SAW. They should upgrade it by adding plastic to the metal parts and solve the mag droping issue. The USMC is starting to realise the "good" of the Ultimax100. It would be a mistake to take a bullpup HBR LMG.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Yes i agree with equlus84, the Ultimax100 is too good to be totally abandoned for an untried new LMG. Maybe we can have some SAR21 LMG to test in the experimental battalion first before coming to a conclusion. But personally i think Ultimax100 Mk 4 will be a much better choice.<br><br>I think no OSA is breached here because a drawing of the SAR21 LMG have been released in the paqers before a few years back. But to be on the safe side, no picture is still better.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"></div>

I see no point in trying to change a good thing. </div></blockquote>Gladly.<br><br>Just a correction, it was the USMC who is looking for a SAW replacement. Their RFI(request for information) was shown to be best met by the Ultimax Mk4.<br><br>Here is a link<br><a href="http://www.defensereview.com/modules.php?name=News&amp;file=article&amp;sid=853" rel="nofollow">http://www.defensereview.com/modules.php?name=News&amp;file=article&amp;sid=853</a><br><br>and what I posted in April about the Ultimax being one of the four Infantry Automatic Rifles in the running, which include the M16A4 HB, H&amp;K G36 HB, the current M249 Minimi.<br><br><a href="http://www.sgforums.com/?action=thread_display&amp;thread_id=185677&amp;page=0" rel="nofollow">http://www.sgforums.com/?action=thread_display&amp;thread_id=185677&amp;page=0</a><br><br>Just an interesting piece of trivia for Ultimax SAW opponents. The Ultimax 100 Mk1 was in the running for  the USMC's SAW program in 1986, which the FN Minimi won and became known as the M249.<br><br>I personally have no gripe with the Ultimax, as it's main engineering flaws have been fixed IMHO in the Mk3A and Mk4.Agreeably, the Mk1 and Mk2 models which were the mainstay for many SAF soldiers were quite flawed in their metallurgy and had no interchangeable barrel.This might have caused the poor impression many have of the Ultimax.<br><br>I have no knowledge of the SAR21 LMG, but I would keep the Ultimax as it is a battle-proven SAW.</div>
