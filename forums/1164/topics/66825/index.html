After a couple of years, for the higher grade scholars they almost automatically become majors!<br><br>That makes them around 27 to 28 years old.

Any comissioned officer of the SAF who isn't a major by 28 has failed his "time-norm" and is complete trash.

The bond ends when they are 28, right near the end of their bond, they are promoted to major as SAF's way of enticing these people to re-sign. so yes. there are 28 yr old majors. even 27 ones.<br><br>but still my challenge is, to not re-sign and come out into the world to start all over again.</div></blockquote>Thats my question. So they never become PC before, right? So they wont have first hand knowledge, right? So, it will be a hey-sway situation for us if we ganna one that is our unit commander and doing all that planning where we have to execute, right?</div>
