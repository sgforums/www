            <div class='col-md body'>hmm just a quick two cents,<br><br>I guess the problem isnt with the scholar system. It is here to stay and it remains one of the way to develop our human resource.<br><br>The discomfort, especially within the uniform service has to do with leadership / combat experience. Most foreign military officers with contact with SG are impressed with our scholar/soldiers and their level of professionalism as well as technical knowledge.<br><br>But many do note that their ranks are quite high in relation to their age and experience in a uniform. So the question of competence is there. Being a career military man is a complete package. Both intellectual competence, leadership ability, decisiveness and a deep sense of honour for the cause is necessary. Track record, so to speak is one of the measures that they take.<br><br>There has to be in the end a proper balance between promotion on time and promotion on merit. Rank being doled out as a means to tempt someone from staying is short sighted and devalues the rank and those that is wearing it. It does not address the root cause of why people want to leave.<br><br>If he really has the bearing and the gravitas of leader, the rewards are and will be natural consequence of his competence. It should not and usually is not his reason that he stays and does the job.</div>
