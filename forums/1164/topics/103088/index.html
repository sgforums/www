It depends how well a leader is recieved by his/her subordinates, i.e. leadership skills.<br><br>Being promoted does have its rewards, e.g. better treatment, own ego satisfied, more challenging task, better pay, etc.</div>

Changes in the system coming up soon, but unconfirmed.<br><br>Present reports suggests that most techs would be CPLs, only those deemed having leadership skills would be sent to SISPEC to undergo 3SG course for promotion  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"><br><br>This would be very much better as we can now differentiate those NSFs with leadership capabilities but unable to hold a combat 3SG rank due to reasons.
