              <p>The Republic of Singapore Navy (RSN) is investigating how the RSS Tenacious, a 141- metre-long stealth frigate, <strong>damaged an underwater cable at a Darwin</strong> naval base after the vessel’s anchor became entangled in a power line.</p>
              <p>The ship was anchored in Darwin Habour after being part of a six-day maritime exercise which ended last Friday.</p>
              <p>Australian news reports said the incident happened when crew members of the Tenacious attempted to pull up the anchor when it snagged a 66,000-volt power cable and raised it 30 metres from the seabed.</p>
              <p>Northern Territory’s Power and Water Corporation have engaged divers to investigate the extent of the damage and added it may take some time before the extent of the damage to the cable is known.</p>
              <p>General Manager of Power Networks Bertram Birk said in a statement that its divers will enter the water when visibility in the area improved.</p>
              <p>“It appears that strong currents are making visibility poor and not allowing us good images for diagnosis,” Birk said.</p>
              <p>“I am advised it may be Tuesday or Wednesday before the currents are more favourable.”</p>
              <p>The harbour master, who is investigating the incident, also added that the incident happened in a clearly marked “no anchor” area.</p>
              <p>According to a statement from the Ministry of Defence (Mindef) on Sunday, crew members of the Tenacious were informed by port authorities on Friday afternoon that the warship might be anchored “too close to some underwater cables”.</p>
              <p>Mindef spokesman Desmond Tan said in a Straits Times report: “The Royal Australian Navy Port Services advised RSS Tenacious to relocate to a new anchorage position.”</p>
              <p>He said that when crew aboard the frigate attempted to retrieve the anchor in the afternoon, they found it had become tangled with an underwater cable.</p>
              <p>He added: “RSS Tenacious immediately ceased the anchor recovery operation and decided to recover the anchor during low tide.”</p>
              <p>The anchor was eventually detached from the cable and retrieved after a 90-minute operation that was carried out in the presence of the naval base’s port authorities.</p>
              <p>The “Singaroo” is an the annual maritime exercise between the Singapore and Australian navies is now in its 14th year. This year’s exercise was hosted by the Royal Australian Navy.</p>

              <p>Dude, power supply lines rarely exceed 6.6kV. And the sea, would have 
              kept the cables grounded. Lastly, the cables used are multi multi multi 
              core, and sheathed, you need to be touching the bare copper just to fry 
              yourself silly.</p>

              <p>-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p>
              <p>Power cable is not a 6.6kv but a 66kv or 100kv standard power cable from news.that is world standard for raw power cables.</p>
              <p>dont mess with stuff like those unless u wanna experiment on u being the grounding point...the cables are small as compared to anchor and power of hoist....and the copper sheathing could already be dmaged by anchor which would arc the anchor and thus turn it and chains to live point.....probably all they need is a unknowing sailor holding chains and accidentally touching water to be electrocuted.</p>

              <p>A teenager set himself on fire when he got an electric shock from an 11,000-volt copper cable he was trying to steal.</p>
              <p>The 18-year-old was found ablaze in disused premises in Newton Aycliffe, County Durham, as a group of youths tried to remove the cabling.</p>
              <p>He suffered extensive burns to his arms and head which were initially described as life-threatening.</p>
              <p>The teenager, from Darlington, was taken to the University Hospital of Durham and later transferred to the Royal Victoria Infirmary in Newcastle where he is now said to be seriously ill but stable.</p>
              <p>The incident happened at about 2pm on Saturday.</p>

              <p>no anchor zone?dun habours give immediate attention if ship was anchored in wrong place????it might be due to poor maintenance of harbour area where signs are often not in the best order or are often more likened to rubbish nailed to walls.</p>
              <p>its the harbour master fault...he didnt do his job in the first place!</p>

              <p>captain shuld sail back to spore. without aussies knowing it..the aussies simply need to study stealth frigate up close...as in materials and construction ...ultrasonic  testing of hull in order to build a better stealth frigate for oz.</p>

              <p>maybe they shouldnt have sent stealth frigates there.its pure stupidity...not only they give oz a free sample of stealth technology from paint....they also collect damages from ship captain who thinks signboard info  is remnants from ww2.</p>
              <p>stealth ships should be seen from a distance and not allowed to be in harbour even!</p>
