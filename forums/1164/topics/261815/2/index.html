            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote>I don't claim to be an expert on the ESSM but if I am not mistaken its effectiveness with regard to the US is because of the highly sophisticated Aegis combat system and not because of the missile itself. In fact judging from the details of the Jane report, it isn't even clear that the ESSM offered to the RMN is supported by the Smart-S/Ceros for S/X band mid course guidance. If not, then the system will have to rely on Homing All the Way mode/ Inertial HAW mode at best, which would of course, make it far less capable against a missile attack. The Aegis system is clearly off-limits to Malaysia both on political and economic grounds. What I'm trying to say is that I am well aware of the bureaucratic hurdles faced by Malaysia in purchasing this weapon but I don't think that it would be unsurpassable. If the sale was to take place, perhaps the RMN will have to make some technical compromises but ultimately it would still go through. I do agree that it would not a major coup for Raytheon on the basis of the quantity purchased. But surely the important thing for them is simply to get a foot in the door, in a country which traditionally had looked towards BAE systems and now MBDA for their naval defence needs, the idea being that one purchase would lead to the next...First the Hornet and then the Superhornet being the most obvious example.</blockquote>Yes, as I`ve said, there would probably be hurdles which would take time to resolve. It would not simply pass through the process like water. And time itself would make it easier for Malaysia to get such weapons; especially if newer systems are to evolve; competing systems from other countries or otherwise. But I would like to add that it may take so long that the potential sale is eventually dropped in favour of the orginal Asters or  Micas or worst even Seawolfs which would mean the original requirement for local area defence would be changed.<br><br>But I disagree with your comment about one Raytheon purchase leading to another. Surely, Raytheon is not myopic enough to know how fickle weaponry purchases are in Malaysia. And it is not as if Malaysia has not bought US weaponry before. To me, it just another sale which Raytheon has made if it is made. And Malaysia is not exactly a trend setter where weapons purchases are concerned in the sense that other countries will follow Malaysia`s lead because of an astute procurement process.<br><br><blockquote><br>I have got friends in the PM's office, Treasury, MINDEF, and the RMAF, that's how I know it was a generous offer. Although I was not privy to all the actual negotiations, I have a fair grasp of the salient points involved. While it is true that the negotiations stalled on several points, some of it because of the US reluctance to provide the RMAF with some of the items they wanted, such as the AESA APG-79 radar, alot of the problems were actually caused by the Malaysian side, especially on the basis of cost because of the after effects of the economic crash in 1998. Later it was complicated by Anwar, the War on Terror...etc. But on almost all the points the US were wiilling to compromise and judging from some recent news the FA-18F is back on track. Again, the point I'm trying to make is that is the US is not as intransigent as some people believe, they are actually very open to negotiation, and even if the RMAF does not receive the full package which they wanted, a downgraded FA-18F is still more than sufficient for their defence needs. After all, who gets a full-spec US weapon? Even the UK and Australia are sometimes unhappy with the package they are offered especially with regard to sensitive items such as software for the F-35.<br></blockquote>Surely, you would not have me believe you for a second based on what you`ve said about your friends. They are speculation to me. Or speculation based on more speculation.<br><br>However, we do know about MAF`s difficulties in getting clearance on some equipment as they were indeed published in the media and the net too. I remembered some netizens posted them as well over the years. This is compunded by the time it has taken for Malaysia to actually purchase the Super-bugs.<br><br>You are probably right in that you might get the F-18 E/F chassis and a downgraded radar if the sale goes through; if ever. Getting an F-18 E/F post-2010 would be a mistake though. But you might not have a choice in this.<br><br>I donÂ’t think you would want to use the F-35 as a barometer at this stage but when the latter is ready to built for the customers and purchased. If you`re referring to source codes, etc, it is still a `no-go' even for the closest of allies. But equipment-wise, it is definitely the case. For example, the US is willing to sell Singapore the global Hawk but is reluctant to pass to us the source codes which would allow us to the modify the software.<br><br>Nobody is saying the US would not sell at all. But there are varying levels of purchasing access; quantitatively or qualitatively based on other interests other than economics.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I really think the effectiveness of the ESSM will really depend on the level of support the M'sians will receive to integrate into their existing system.

To know the high/low of the possibility, one needs to apply a reality check.

For that you need to speak to the people directly involved.<br><br><strong>Again, you have misread the issue. I am simply making a point as per how interpretation(relative to countries)matters when it comes to description of weapons purchases. So, it may be big issue for some countries but less so for others.</strong><br><br>I can only give the opinion of the people who were engaged in the negotiations. To a man, they all thought it was a good deal for Malaysia and the RMAF. Granted, this is a subjective matter, and one man's meat is another's poison, but I saw no reason to second guess them. Its true that the package offered did not include all the items which the RMAF wanted but they all thought that what was on offer was satisfactory, and what was not included could perhaps be included after more negotiation. But again this is a matter where opinions might differ.</div>

You disagreed with this statement. Then you asked me how I knew that the Boeing deal was 'generous' and whether I was involved in the actual negotiations. When I pointed out that I had spoken to the people involved in the actual negotiations, you questioned the veracity of my claims, and my credibility, and now desire a report from a reputable news agency. As I have tried to explain to you in the previous post, I am not at liberty to substantiate my claims by pointing out the technical and financial details in the open.  As I have also pointed out in a previous post, these reputable news agencies are not privy to all the details that are included in these deals. As I am sure you can appreciate, some of the details are confidenctial and will not be reported to the media. If you are don't wish to believe me it does not really matter WHAT I write, or how many links that I post. I happen to think that speaking to the people negotiating the deal is actually more credible than a report from a news agency, simply because they are privy to certain aspects of the deal which are not going to be reported in the media. For e.g I am sure that there are members in Singapore's military and government who know more about F-15SG deal than Jane's Defence Review because they have access to the full technical details which JDW's reporters do not, but that is just my opinion.</div>

After all, this is not the first time they have bought weapons from the US and they are realistic enough not to expect to get everything on their wish-list due to political/economic factors not in their control.

After all, this is a public internet forum. I was merely responding to your demand to know my sources, and whether I was involved in the actual negotiations. I revealed them and you doubted my credibility. I am really beginning to regret not lying through my teeth and claiming that I was involved in the negotiations, or that I was working for the RMAF, or Boeing, or the Malaysian government. After all, if you wish to lie, you might as well lie big. But again, this is your right, and short of meeting me in person or conducting a thorough background check on me, I don't see any way of convincing you. You can only judge me on what I have written, or based on previous posts on whether the person has expertise on what he/she has written. For e.g., I have no problems believing that some members on Military Nuts or Defence Forum have some connection with the military or the aerospace industry based on the posts that they have written. But whether I can prove this in a court of law is of course another matter.<br><br><strong>The fact that I find newsworthy sources more reliable has got nothing to do with the fact that you can, on occasions, disagree with them naturally.

Which is why I said that talking to the military people sometimes reveals details which are not going to be reported in the open media but more importantly they have the necessary insight to see how a decision will impact on the armed forces concerned. I am not questioning JDW's credibility but merely suggesting that because they are not going to have access to all the necessary facts, this might affect their judgement, especially on technical matters.</div>
