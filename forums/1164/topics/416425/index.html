              <p>Interesting. I would have tot the answer would be the president as Singapore C-in-C.</p>
              <p>Under the SAF pledge, soldiers are supposed to bear "true faith and allegiance" to the president.</p>
              <p>However, pursuant to the SAF Act, a commander is defined as</p>
              <dl>
              <p> "commander" , in relation to any person subject to military law, means an officer of or above the rank of captain or a senior military expert for the time being commanding a unit or units or part of a unit of the Singapore Armed Forces;</p>
              </dl><dl></dl>
              <p>That means that the person would either have to be an officer or a senior military expert.</p>
              <dl>
              <p> "officer" means a person appointed by the President of Singapore or the proper authority to hold the rank of officer in the Singapore Armed Forces and includes any person commissioned as an officer under any written law that is repealed by this Act;</p>
              </dl><dl>
              <p> "senior military expert" means a military expert of or above the rank of ME4;</p>
              </dl>
              <p>So not withstanding that the president can appoint himself an officer or a senior military expert, the fact that he hasn't would mean that he is not a "commander" under the SAF Act.</p>
              <p>Accordingly, the highest ranked officer would be CDF. In short, Singapore C-In-C would be CDF.</p>

              <p>That's a great answer from you. Thanks. I wish that the PAP would make it clear on who is the C-in-C. While the oath may cause people to think it is SR nathan, however, de facto, it is the CDF. In the US, the President is C-in-C by ex officio. the Chairman of the Joint chiefs of staff is the highest ranking officer but not C-in-C.</p>
              <p>But I feel that PAP not clarifying who is the <em>de jure</em> C-in-C can cause confusion.</p>
              <p>But your answer is good. Thanks for it.</p>
