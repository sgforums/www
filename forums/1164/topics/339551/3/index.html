              <p>so u see.In July 2008,UK MOD was initially looking for replacement of BV 206.</p>
              <p>Later,they cancelled this procurement and advanced one step further</p>
              <p>to replace BvS 10,the successor of BV206!!The BvS 10 was in services</p>
              <p>in UK from 2003.Is it very strange that UK looks for replacement</p>

              					Defence correspondent</p>
              <h2>British
              lives have been lost in Iraq and Afghanistan because of waste and
              inefficiency in the way equipment is procured, according to a new book.</h2>
              <p>http://news.sky.com/skynews/Home/UK-News/UK-Military-Lives-Lost-As-Money-Wasted-On-Extravagant-Projects-Not-Basic-Equipment/Article/200811415161614?lpos=UK_News_News_Your_Way_Region_3&amp;lid=NewsYourWay_ARTICLE_15161614_UK_Military_Lives_Lost_As_Money_Wasted_On_Extravagant_Projects_Not_Basic_Equipment</p>
              <blockquote>
              <p>He claims that waste of up to £3bn a year includes:</p>
              <p><strong>::</strong> The RAF's Typhoon <a href="http://indepth.news.sky.com/InDepth/topic/Eurofighter"><strong>Eurofighter</strong></a>, which started 20 years ago but is only now in service. It has more than doubled in cost to £20bn and is over four years late.</p>
              <p><strong>::</strong> The Nimrod spy plane - £800m over budget and delayed by eight years.</p>
              <p><strong>::</strong> The Astute nuclear submarine programme - £1bn overspent and four years behind.</p>
              <p>Reg Keys agrees that extravagant projects diverted money from <span style="color: #ff0000;">basic equipment like radios and ammunition.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">It was the lack of vital supplies and communication that caused the
                      death of his son Tom, along with five other Royal Military Policemen,
                      massacred by a mob in <a href="http://indepth.news.sky.com/InDepth/topic/Iraq"><strong>Iraq</strong></a>.</span></p>
              <p>"The military don't place enough value on human lives," he told Sky News.</p>
              <p>"They just regard them as so much expendable hardware."</p>
              <p>Armoured trucks like the well-regarded Mastiff have reached the
                      front line in record time, part of £6bn spent on new kit this year.</p>
              <p>The MoD has dismissed claims of under-funding as "outdated, sensational, nonsense".</p>

              <blockquote><em>Bronco on brink of winning UK's Warthog contract</em><br> by Tim Ripley (JDW Correspondent)<br> <br> Singapore Technologies (ST) Kinetics appears to be on the verge of
                  securing the British Army as the first export customer for its Bronco
                  armoured all-terrain vehicle (ATV).<br> <br> This comes after UK Ministry of Defence (MoD) procurement officials
                  <span style="color: #ff0000;">withdrew from negotiations with BAE Systems Hagglunds in relation to
                  the UK's Warthog </span>requirement. In a statement to <em>Jane's</em>, the MoD said it had narrowed the choice for the Warthog down to a<span style="color: #ff0000;"> single contractor</span>.(lion note:pl read below for verification#)<br> <br> "<span style="color: #ff0000;">Warthog must be a readily available military off-the-shelf (MOTS)
                  solution, available for delivery of a capability ASAP</span>," the MoD said.
                  "[We] are negotiating with a manufacturer on a potential order to
                  fulfill the Warthog requirement in Afghanistan. Should they be
                  successful, the department will procure 100 vehicles with delivery
                  starting in 2009." Sources close to the Warthog programme team in the
                  MoD confirmed to <em>Jane's</em> that officials had now decided to<span style="color: #ff0000;"> talk only to the Singapore-based company.</span><br> <br> <em>Jane's</em> understands that a team from ST Kinetics visited the UK
                  earlier this month to talk to ministry officials and a UK delegation
                  has also visited Singapore to view the vehicle. The aim is to award a
                  contract by the end of the current year. <br> <br> The source said ministry staff were not using the term 'preferred
                  bidder' in relation to ST Kinetics but that it appeared they were no
                  longer looking at purchasing the upgraded variant of the BAE Systems
                  Hagglunds Viking Mk 2 vehicle. <br> <br> "More than one company was looked at but only one company met the
                  requirement," said the source. "The Viking has reached the limit of its
                  capabilities to add on armour and other enhancements. Only one
                  manufacturer fitted the bill when we put down the requirement."<br> <br> The source confirmed that no trials of the Bronco had yet taken place, commenting: "It is too early to talk about trials."<br> <br> BAE Systems told <em>Jane's</em>: "We are offering the Viking Mk 2,
                  which offers proven reliability and maneuverability, as well as the
                  fleet commonality benefits of simplified logistics and training. In
                  addition, Viking Mk 2 has an increased payload of six tonnes and
                  built-in mine protection to at least the same level as the urgent
                  operational requirement mine-protection upgrade we are currently
                  carrying out for the existing Viking fleet." <br> <br> In a comparison document drawn up by BAE Systems and seen by <em>Jane's</em>,
                  the company claims that, although it can only carry eight passengers
                  compared to the Bronco's 10, the Viking Mk 2 is battle-proven in
                  Afghanistan, has demonstrated 88 per cent reliability in theatre and
                  has a proven logistic support system. The Viking Mk 2 also has greater
                  climbing performance and better ability to be upgraded with additional
                  armour, says the report.</blockquote>

              <p>from my dear friend, SGTY</p>
              <blockquote>
              <p>Well, I think he is just about to compartmentalize very well...
                                      which is not surprising given he has long shown an keen ability to
                                      be selective about what he percieves and believes... or maybe he
                                      simply reconstructs reality to whatever he wants to believes and
                                      part of that is needing to shout that out to other people to allow
                                      his unreality to have an "effect" in the real world.</p>
              <p>If you have been here for a while<strong> you would be aware that he was
                                      caught for using clones once. He created a thread under a false
                                      account and then started talking to himself, trying to give people
                                      the impression that at least there were people supporting.</strong></p>
              <p>When<strong> caught for he, he panicked and made up several bizzare
                                      excuses, accusing me of hacking his account to make him post under
                                      the false account </strong>(which by the way does not explain how he talks
                                      to himself), and then going away for a while.</p>
              <p>Till this day if you ask him about the<span style="text-decoration: underline;"> clone inciden</span>t, he will
                                      not dare to talk about it... in fact he treats it like it didn't
                                      exist at all... which is basically what he has been doing all the
                                      while. <strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">When something crops up or a rebuttal comes up that he
                                      cannot answer (which is very often), he simply treats it like he
                                      never asked the question in the first place and moves on, and then
                                      later when enough time has passed he'll raise the same issue in the
                                      same way, as if letting a dead point lie low long enough will allow
                                      it to have any effect at all.</span></strong></p>
              <p>Not suprisingly, we've seen so many of his methods in here that
                                      nobody is really impressed by them anymore, but I suspect he keeps
                                      doing what he does is to snare th<span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>e newcomers to this forum who do
                                      not know his history so he can lure them into some pro-Singapore,
                                      anti-rest-of-world monologue...</strong></span></p>
              <p>But of course if we note recently his posts have been becoming
                                      more and more ineffective, I've requested the mods personally to
                                      take action against him if he decides to troll in this forum, so
                                      they're watching him careful.</p>
              <p>I wonder if he'll learn any lesson from the latest incident of
                                      his threads getting pwned.</p>
              <p>But in any case this remains the same- he's all noise and no
                                      bite... i mean has he ever won anybody to his side after 3
                                      disasterous years in here?</p>
              <p>Nope, <span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>he's just wasting his energy venting and trying to create
                                      a picture of Singapore that isn't.</strong></span>.. in the meantime he's just
                                      providing us with entertainment and target practice.</p>

              <p>pl note capability of Bronco has been improved since 2001 debut:</p>
              <p>crossing vertical obstacle from 0.6 m increase to 1 m.(Leo 1.15m.)</p>
              <p>trench crossing increase from 1.5 to 2.0 m.(Leo 3 m)</p>
              <p>This is not bad compared with MBT which is much bigger and more</p>

              <p>I am waiting for your valuable input.</p>
              <p>2.Can i ask where is the official info about BAE suing STK
              for</p>
              <p>Bronco?In appearance?In engine?In internal layout?</p>
              <p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Will STK buy
              the used BvS 10 or BV 206 from UK MOD?</span></strong></p>
              <p>This is one of the option to take the burden out from UK
              MOD.</p>
              <p>It can save MOD $$ too.</p>
              <p>3.UK MOD will not be so stupid to look for replacement if BvS
              10</p>
              <p>is good for enhanced to a bigger version.The replacement,if
              any,</p>
              <p>will create logistic problem.But u have to balance
              risks,benefits</p>
              <p>and costs.May be they dunt have confidence on bigger or more
              armour</p>
              <p>BvS 10!!We will know the reasons soon!!</p>

              <p>I don't give a fuck about giving you input. You are by and far the worst pest I have seen on this forum, barring the usual moronic elements that come along. So shut the fuck up and get the fuck lost.</p>
