              <p>Yep, they said everything will be finalised next week. Let's keep fingers crossed for all to go well. Won't it be the first major sale by S'pore to a key NATO country (not counting the joint production of F2000 with Turkey)?</p>
              <p>ST seems to be doing well in spite of the global downturn. They just sold an Endurance class LPD to Thai navy for $200 mil last month.</p>

              <p>Negotiations
                  on the sale of just over 100 vehicles have been completed in the last
                  48 hours, government sources said. The contract is expected to be
                  announced officially by the MoD within the week.</p>
              <div class="related"></div>
              <p><strong>The Ministry of Defence denied the deal had been completed.</strong></p>
              <p><strong>In
                  a statement it said, "Discussions are still ongoing as to the vehicle
                  type to fulfill the Warthog requirement for operations in Afghanistan.
                  We will procure over 100 new vehicles with deliveries starting at the
                  end of next year."</strong></p>
              <p>A spokeswomen for STK declined to comment.</p>
              <p>The
                  selection is a major setback for armored vehicle supplier BAE Systems.
                  The company's Viking all-terrain vehicle has been in service with the
                  Royal Marines for several years. It's also been in use in Afghanistan
                  by the British Army.</p>
              <p>BAE's Swedish subsidiary, Hägglunds, bid a
                  Mark 2 version of the Viking but failed to overcome its Singaporean
                  rival who offered a higher payload and more capacity to transport
                  troops. Bronco deliveries are expected to start next year.</p>
              <p>The
                  vehicles, to be known as Warthogs in British service, will replace
                  Vikings currently being operated in southern Afghanistan by the British
                  military.</p>
              <p>Bronco is already in service with the Singaporean armed
                  forces, but the British deal will be the first export win for STK.
                  Thales UK is expected to be the vehicle integrator for the British
                  Broncos.</p>
              <p>As the Singaporeans prepare to conclude the deal, it
                  emerged earlier this week that <strong>BAE had secured an urgent operational
                  requirement to upgrade the Viking fleet in Afghanistan with increased
                  protection against mines and roadside bombs. About 120 vehicles are
                  having armored belly plates and other measures fitted.</strong></p>

              <p>unlike a certain RAH RAH SINGAH PURRR RAH lion, who's bigotry knows no limits and simply is too blind to notice his logical flaws, i prefer to take a more balanced position</p>

              <p>+ points</p>
              <p>- reference sale</p>
              <p>- opportunity to combat prove the Bronco (in afghanistan, a particularly harsh environment that is known to wear down equipment and have extremely high attrition rates )</p>
              <p>- branding : ST Eng's profile in arms sales may be taken up another notch</p>
              <p>- potential sales : if this sale is successful, the bronco family of vehicles may be able to break into the UK market and replace the Bv206 in the future</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>-points</p>
              <p>- as raised by some members in another local forum, Afghanistan isnt exactly very friendly to vehicles, either way, its going to have an impact on the performance. this might give the bronco a bad name in time to come</p>
              <p>- 7.62 ball protection and tested protection up to 12kg of TNT mines isnt exactly going to protect the Bronco from possible larger land mines and RPG</p>
              <p>- if ST ENG screw up this one, they probably can forget about future sales for this platform</p>
              <p>- this may be an interim operation requirement vs a long-term procurement program. two circumstancial evidence to prove this. not really strong though,</p>
              <p>(i) according to a poster on another forum, Britain has upgraded its bv206/bv10s to a mk2 standard for an urgent operational requirement in afghanistan</p>
              <p>(ii) NATO uses Bv206/bv10. commonality and similarity across other armies and operators like sweden, germany, finland and norway. USMC also operates a variant. Long term wise, the Procurement of Bronco may be even on a lease agreement since UK MOD Is cash strapped following the construction of the two carriers and operations in afghanistan.</p>
              <p>my personal take is that, Bronco fits the bill, for now, but is unlikely to be part of projected future requirements.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Good time for ST eng, first the thai endurance and now the Bronco. good time to buy ST Stock. order book / production lines should be good for the next 2-3 years.</p>
              <p>good time to congratulate the lion for self-pwning again.</p>

              <p>ild like to raise a point here.</p>
              <p>the Bv206 has created a pretty positive and decent reputation for itself in afghanistan. will the Bronco surpass that ? granted these sources arent exactly the most objective or transparent ones, but they do give an indication of how well percieved is the Bv206.</p>
              <p>I seemingly find it quite hard that with so much experience and raves from crew and commanders about the Bv206, that UK MOD would simply switch to the bronco despite it offering a larger payload and being based on a Bv206.</p>
              <p>i suggest that the news "leak" may be an <strong>orchestrated wayang wayang</strong> by UK MOD. for what reasons i m not sure, maybe to get Bae Haggelunds to cut bump it up the waiting list for its orders ? but i wont take the speculation on the Bronco being chosen too seriously. seems rather strange (despite the better payload and protection) that the UK MOD would simply disregard the established platform.</p>

              <p>its speculation, MOD hasnt confirmed anything on the Sale of the

              <p>tell me lionnoisy, which part does it say confirmation ? which
              part does it say britan MOD buying bronco ?</p>
              <p>another <strong>OUTRIGHT LIE</strong></p>
              <p>http://www.defensenews.com/story.php?i=3849630&amp;c=ASI&amp;s=LAN</p>
              <p>unlike a certain RAH RAH SINGAH PURRR RAH lion, who's bigotry
              knows no limits and simply is too blind to notice his logical
              flaws, i prefer to take a more balanced position</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>+ points</p>
              <p>- reference sale</p>
              <p>- opportunity to combat prove the Bronco (in afghanistan, a
              particularly harsh environment that is known to wear down equipment
              and have extremely high attrition rates )</p>
              <p>- branding : ST Eng's profile in arms sales may be taken up
              another notch</p>
              <p>- potential sales : if this sale is successful, the bronco
              family of vehicles may be able to break into the UK market and
              replace the Bv206 in the future</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>-points</p>
              <p>- as raised by some members in another local forum, Afghanistan
              isnt exactly very friendly to vehicles, either way, its going to
              have an impact on the performance. this might give the bronco a bad
              name in time to come</p>
              <p>- 7.62 ball protection and tested protection up to 12kg of TNT
              mines isnt exactly going to protect the Bronco from possible larger
              land mines and RPG</p>
              <p>- if ST ENG screw up this one, they probably can forget about
              future sales for this platform</p>
              <p>- this may be an interim operation requirement vs a long-term
              procurement program. two circumstancial evidence to prove this. not
              really strong though,</p>
              <p>(i) according to a poster on another forum, Britain has upgraded
              its bv206/bv10s to a mk2 standard for an urgent operational
              requirement in afghanistan</p>
              <p>(ii) NATO uses Bv206/bv10. commonality and similarity across
              other armies and operators like sweden, germany, finland and
              norway. USMC also operates a variant. Long term wise, the
              Procurement of Bronco may be even on a lease agreement since UK MOD
              Is cash strapped following the construction of the two carriers and
              operations in afghanistan.</p>
              <p>my personal take is that, Bronco fits the bill, for now, but is
              unlikely to be part of projected future requirements.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Good time for ST eng, first the thai endurance and now the
              Bronco. good time to buy ST Stock. order book / production lines
              should be good for the next 2-3 years.</p>

              <p>hmm, i m not sure. In any case, my bad for confusing the mk2 and the Urgent operating requirement in afghanistan</p>
              <p>isnt the Mk2 viking supposed to be built at the same plant as the Bvs10 ? As in they are not opening a new production line for it, germany has an order for 75 Bvs 10 to be built .</p>
              <p>which pushes the Mk2 to a delayed production and delivery timeslot. but all this on the assumption that they are using the same plant/production line</p>
              <p>I m not sure about the Offset package as well, Bae Hagglunds has threatened to cut jobs in the UK and closure of some facilities if they lose the viking deal (not sure how credible this can be as the viking upgrading program is still in the works.</p>
              <p>ST eng is pretty liberal with offsets and joint production as can be seen in the Ottakar terrex join deal. but offsets and production in the Uk for 100 broncos ? maybe yes, maybe no.</p>
              <p>I really find it dubious that the bronco has won. for the record, i still think its a good thing if the Bronco has won. Just that upon examination of the big picture, how the Bronoco dosent really fit into the picture.</p>
              <p>any speculation on the MOD denial and release results ? i think it has to do with political pressure with BAE land systems. In bad times like this they cant cut production lines and jobs</p>

              <p>I think you read wrong.</p>
              <p>Correct - Britain is upgrading the BvS10 via an Urgent
              Operational Requirement contract to add belly armour plates and
              improved crew seating arrangements.</p>
              <p>Wrong - This does not result in a new Mk 2 designation for the
              existing BvS10 in service.  The Mk 2 designation is
              specifically for an uparmoured and upsized model for the
              competition tender against the Bronco ATTC.  This is based on
              the existing BvS10 but will be different vehicle altogether ...
              even if only in dimensions and specs.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The Viking Mk2 is still in development stage and will not be
              ready for production until 1Q-2Q 2009.</p>
              <p>There may well be other reasons for the leaked news and MoD
              supposed denial.  All will be made clear pretty soon.</p>
              <p>Which means that there is no waiting list for the order to be
              bumped up.  This will be a new model for Bae/Hagglunds and the
              Royal Marines will be the launch customer ... so to speak.</p>

              <p>yes i do know the payload differences and i have taken into
              account the difference. must i remind you of what exactly you
              posted ?</p>
              <p>your If dosent preclude your statement so it dosent represent
              anything.</p>
              <p>what about NATO compatability / NATO inter operability ?</p>
              <p>What about BAE hagglunds lawsuit against ST ENG over the bronco
              bv206 in the past ? any infringement of the settlement ?</p>
              <p>I m suggesting a possibility and not a fact. i dont go around
              shooting my mouth off saying that this has happened when its
              non-existent. i am merely offering a educated guess, calculated
              speculation if you'd like.</p>
              <p>not empty verbosity like you.</p>
              <p>in any case, i think smart money will be on the BVS10. 2
              reasons, <span style="color: #ff0000;">Nato interoperability, improved protection and job offsets
              in</span> EU. Bronco is not by any means, a lesser platform, just that it
              looses out in the political aspect out the deal.</p>

              <p>The Mk II carries 12 crew and passengers, has a payload of 6 metric
                      tons and a gross vehicle weight of 14.2 metric tons. The Bronco can fit
                      in 16 crew and passengers, has a gross weight of 18 metric tons and a
                      payload of 6.8 metric tons.</p>
              <p>The Bronco vehicle is currently in service with Singapore's military, while the Viking Mk II is in development.</p>
              <p>Release
                      of the performance comparison between the Viking Mk II and the Bronco
                      vehicle was part of a rearguard action by BAE to salvage a deal for
                      around 100 vehicles, which was heading Singapore's way.</p>
              <p>The vehicles will replace Vikings currently in service in Afghanistan.</p>
              <p>The
                      Singaporeans are tied up here wit<span style="color: #ff0000;">h Thales UK,</span> who would be the Bronco
                      vehicle integrator if the deal with the British is confirmed.</p>
              <p>French
                      defense newsletter<span style="color: #ff0000;"> TTU a</span>nd others have been reporting in the last few
                      days that the Bronco had been selected for the British requirement to
                      provide a vehicle to be known as the <span style="color: #ff0000;">Warthog</span>.</p>
              <p>The MoD spokeswoman
                      said, "Discussions are still ongoing as to the vehicle type to fulfill
                      the Warthog requirement for operations in Afghanistan. We hope to make
                      an announcement shortly."--end of quote</p>

              <p>No idea.  But as it is, it is a definite that the development of the Mk 2 will not be finished till end 1Q Y09 at the earliest.  Which has the same effect on the timeline issue and can't be hurried up much ... leaked press reports or not.</p>

              <p>NATO inter-operability and compatibility is more an issue of electronics (specifically comms and IFF) then physical logistics.</p>

              <p>its thinking here that counts. if i wanted to put up  ST eng PDF's i would have done so, but clearly i m not shameless enough to cut and paste it and upload it to my photobucket album.</p>
              <p>Lionnoisy, Mediacorp emailed me and are asking for your name and contact details, i told them i didnt know. matter is beyond me. they say they are investigating.</p>
              <p><strong>please remember that taking images without permission and proper consent  and claiming ownership is THEFT. under the copyright law 1987 in the republic of singapore.<br></strong></p>
              <p>seems like you havent learnt your lesson. is a email to ST eng in order as well ? you are asking for it</p>
              <p>you want me to rebuke you ?</p>
              <p>- why you cite only ST eng sources ? will you buy a car based on the manufacturer's claims ? seems like you are the one in need of a reality check. so if ST eng claims bronco can fly to the moon you believe ? that is a OFFICIAL SOURCE AND OFFICIAL CLAIM ?</p>
              <p>- why you dont mention the fact that the bronco has no combat record unlike the Bvs10 and Bvs 206 ? why dont you cite and provide conclusive proof of Bronco's performance ? why no other country purchase aside from SG ?</p>
              <p>applying your first time buyer logic/ first buyer for a platform and orphan platform logic from the 737 wedgetail and collins class and anzac class does that mean SAF made a retarded decision buying the bronco ? bronco was first fielded when, why up till now no other purchase ? bronco also has civillian version, why not popular ?</p>
              <p>- why dont you mention the fact that the bronco is significantly based on the Bv206 to a large extent that a lawsuit was brought against ST eng because of the hydraulic link ?</p>
              <p>-bv206/bvs 10 proven under harsh operating condition from temperate tundra/boreal type forests with extremities ranging from below zero operating conditions to above 40 degrees in hot and high conditions in dusty and desert conditions in iraq and afghanistan.</p>
              <p>WHAT ABOUT BRONCO ? proven ? tested in jungle singapore. sure wow, i m aware of that. i m sure an annual climatic variation from 24deg C to 35 deg C counts for EXTREME TOUGH CONDITIONS. what about extreme climatic variations under combat operational stress ? like afghanistan ? exceed 40 deg C in summer, below 0 in winter.  a big fat fucking zero.</p>
              <p>see lionnoisy ? maybe a person with your<strong> illogic </strong>can concieve to buy a vehicle who's manufacturer can claim it flies to the moon and can do everything including roll over and begging for a bone. you might believe it, i m sure some might be inclined to believe in you.<strong> but please, spare me your bullshit.</strong></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>ild critically examine the issue from all sides. if it were up to me, and money and politics were not any limiting factor, ild be pretty damned sure that bae haggulands / bae land systems would win the warthog deal.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>@kotay</p>
              <p>i was thinking more in terms of physical logistics / commonality. seeing that the BVs 10 and the BV206 is present or in service in sweden, germany, US, UK.</p>
              <p>the bronco would stick out in terms of parts and serviciability.it would be supporting a unique platform that is nowhere else in service in the world. i.e you dont exactly see cadillacs all over the world.</p>
              <p>hmm, regarding the thales intergreation, i think it'd be more to do with the bowman communications system right ?</p>
              <p>i mentioned the lawsuit part since apparently lionnoisy and his rah rah singapura idiocity seems to overlook the fact that Bae hagglunds considered the bronco to be a sufficient rip off of its Bv206 patent that it took ST eng to court</p>
              <p>still, on the sheer basis of the lawsuit, Bae land systems could always screw the ST eng deal by highlighting the copyright case to the media. Even if they lose the subsequent 2nd lawsuit or legal hoo-haa about the Bronco/Bv206, they could derail or scupper the procurement schedule by opening a political can of worms, which would make the Bvs 10 mark II avaliable in time. (over reading too much into it ?)</p>
              <p>the bronco represents an interesting prospect in the sense that its intruding into Bae land systems traditional backyard. imagine if the Bronco surpasses expectations. who's next ? sweden germany greece ? it represents the potential opening of a entirely fresh market for ST eng and a potentially aggressive intrusion into BAE's home turf. the way i see it, its a defence industry turf war.</p>
              <p>plus with the increased pressure on MOD finances and Obama expected to declare a surge in afghanistan, the warthog procurement might be delayed further due to troop pullback and cutdowns.</p>
              <p>i m speculating that either way, the odds are stacked against ST eng. not that i believe the bronco is by any means the lesser platform.</p>

              <p>I am thrilled by the fact that our locally made Bronco has pushed BAE/Hagglunds BV S10 hard enough.</p>
              <p>There must be a huge reason behind why UK MOD is considering more Broncos where they could upgrade their existing S10.</p>
              <p>As export sales are hugely influenced by political factors, it will be interesting to see how this develop.</p>

              <p>interesting. i got a tankie mechanic friend and he tells me all sorts of stories about individual platforms.</p>
              <p>aside from the fact there is a bumpy ride, he's all raves about the bronco. apparently the bronco is a really fast mover.</p>
              <p>rolling over is a hazard for any armoured vehicle i suppose, cant really do much about that.</p>
              <p>hmm where and whom did you hear the laser pointer for the SAR21 will fall off ? seems quite dubious.</p>
              <p>the SAR 21 LAD (laser aiming device)  is one module that is placed entirely within the handgrip / plastic casing of the SAR 21. ive never heard of it falling off. maybe the battery cap ? i know battery caps get lost and fall off pretty easily but definitely not the LAD module. its entirely embedded within the rifle.</p>
