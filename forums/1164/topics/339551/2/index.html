              <p>I am thrilled by the fact that our locally made Bronco has
                  pushed BAE/Hagglunds BV S10 hard enough.</p>
              <p>There must be a huge reason behind why UK MOD is considering
                  more Broncos where they could upgrade their existing S10.</p>
              <p>As export sales are hugely influenced by political factors, it

              <h2>The Active High-Technology Survivability Solution</h2>
              <br> AMAP-ADS is an active protection system. Attacks from the most varied
                  of weapon systems – including projectiles with speeds of up to 2,000
                  m/s – are opto-electronically detected and intercepted in microseconds.
                  It therefore provides protection from attacks fired from a very close
                  distance. <br> <br> Manual system operation is unnecessary and a 360° multi-hit protection
                  of hemispherical cover is provided. With a weight of only 145 to 500 kg
                  (depending on vehicle), even light vehicles can be equipped with this
                  highly-effective survivability system. The possibility of using faster
                  and more manoeuvrable vehicles in high-threat potential situations
                  creates completely new tactical opportunities.<br> <br> AMAP-ADS provides protection against the following threats:<br> 
              <ul>
              <li> Anti-tank guided missiles (ATGMs)</li>
              <li> Handheld Anti-Tank weapons (including RPG-7)</li>
              <li> KE projectiles of all calibres, mid- and large calibre APFSDS</li>
              <li> Explosively Formed Projectiles (EFPs)</li>

              <p>BIG MISTAKE LIONNOISY</p>
              <p>till now up to this point in the thread you cant differentiate between the BV206, BVS 10 and BVS 10 ++ /warthog requirement improvement on the BVS10 ?</p>
              <p>in case you havent compared the BVS10 and the bronco, they are both pretty similar in terms of payload and empty weight. just that the bronco has an added under carraige mine protection which has been tested up to 12kg of explosives (pretty big charge)</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>fact 1:<br>BVS 10 has been in operational service with not only the UK, but with the dutch royal marines</p>

              <p>interesting. i got a tankie mechanic friend and he tells me all

              <p>aside from the fact there is a bumpy ride, he's all raves about
                  the bronco. apparently the bronco is a really fast mover.</p>
              <p>rolling over is a hazard for any armoured vehicle i suppose,

              <p>the SAR 21 LAD (laser aiming device)  is one module that is

                  ive never heard of it falling off. maybe the battery cap ? i know
                  battery caps get lost and fall off pretty easily but definitely not
                  the LAD module. its entirely embedded within the rifle.</p>

              <p>There's probably no argument (my friend in question was a Bronco driver) that the vehicle is pretty fast and maneuverable. The only problem was that the articulator unit doesn't apply enough of a counter torque to ensure the rear vehicle doesn't topple. Or they can issue orders to not go on so and so terrain but that limits the utility of the said vehicle and in a terrain like Afghanistan, it's going to be hard to justify bringing such a vehicle. If anything, the British Army should consider employing MRAPs instead if they are bloody worried about IEDs.</p>
              <p>And according to my friend, the unit he was in suppressed the incidents involving it toppling over. I'm not sure if that applied to other units, but yeah.</p>

              <p>ah.. problem with MRAPs is when u have existing road infrastructure like in iraq, its perfectly fine.</p>
              <p>but in stan, where the MRAPs are forced to go offroad to hunt for taliban, it puts a heavy strain on the suspension. IIRC, MRAPs were not designed for offroad conflicts/bush wacking like heavy armoured vehicles.</p>
              <p>plus, MRAPs are more likely to topple over due to high centre of gravity.</p>

              <p>Errr .... NATO also operates like 6+ types of MBTs all with different powerpacks and transmissions.  Let's not even start counting the other AFVs and vehicles.</p>
              <p>What you should be talking about is the logisitics commonality within the end-user units at Division level and below.  In this case, there is a point to be made that the Royal Marines are already using the Viking Mk1 and that there <strong>may</strong> be some logistics synergy to be had there.</p>
              <p>That's of course provided that the Mk2 Viking is still using the same power plant and transmission pack as the Mk1.  Given that it is going to be up sized, there is quite a chance it won't have.  That'd make the Bronco less of an odd-fit than you're making it out to be</p>

              <p>The UK MoD is perhaps thinking that their current mix of 3 &amp; 5 tonners are not adequate to the task in Afghanistan and are issuing a tender for a 7 tonner equivalent - either the Bronco or the Viking Mk 2.</p>

              <p>these news from Jane's and reponses are useful:</p>
              <p>http://www.defencetalk.com/forums/showthread.php?p=160384#post160384</p>
              <blockquote>2.  The last 2 paragraphs in the (Jane's.Pl read the above link)article reads like Jane's lobbying on behalf BAE Systems, especially since:<br> <blockquote>(i) it is clear that the Viking has reached the limit of
              its capabilities (to add on armour) and that only ST Kinetics' Bronco
              ATTC fit the bill of the UK's Warthog requirements;<br> <br> (ii) Jane's obscures the fact (in it's reporting) that what BAE Systems
              is offering to MoD is not what UK wants (even after the proposed
              upgrade). What BAE Systems is lobbying for is a change in the
              requirements on the Warthog contract;<br> <br> (iii) Jane's focuses instead on the fact that the Viking is
              battle-proven and is easier on the current logistic support system - in
              fact, Jane's managed to subtly weave in the ideas that this is the
              Bronco's first export sale - neglecting to mention that the Bronco has
              been in service for 8 years; <br> <br> (iv) Jane's also fails to mention the Bronco's <span style="color: #ff0000;">advanced patented
              coupling</span> that links the front and rear units (allowing each unit can be
              transported slung under a tactical helicopter). This unique feature
              allows the user to 'plug and play' so that different units can be
              attached as required by the mission - a feature not available in the
              Viking; and<br> <br> (v) people like luv2surf telling us that "the Bronco simply a beefed up
              copy of the Viking", when the Bronco ATTC hull is made from welded
              steel armour with a German IBD passive armour package (and for good
              order, ST Kinetics has shown a Bronco ATTC with an AMAP-ADS active
              protection system).</blockquote>3.  I say, shame on your quality of reporting - Mr Tim Ripley. <br> <br> 4. I also say, shame on you - Mr ' luv2surf' - for flame bating and
              trying to say that a readily available military off-the-shelf (MOTS)
              solution is just a cheap imitation.<br> <br> 5. As I have pointed out in my earlier post, there are 600 Bronco ATTCs
              in service and ST Kinetics developed a number of versions of the
              Bronco. ST Kinetics is even working on a robotic version of the Bronco
              ATTC. In the interest of fairness, I've set out the article in the 3
              Dec 2008 issue of Jane's below:</blockquote>

              <p> </p>
              <p>3) so now you resort to 3rd hand postings , not even acknowledging the user who posted the content and the poster who posted the link ?</p>
              <p>lol... whatever happened to your OFFICIAL SOURCE and OFFICIAL SITE and OFFICIAL evidence ?</p>
              <p>you realized that this is about credible as wiping your soiled bottom with a tissue paper and trying to pass it off as currency ?</p>
              <p>the poster's point (i) is rendered moot, the mk2 viking has an added capacity to carry and have more heavy armour</p>
              <p>(ii) i cant contest since i havent read the Jane's article</p>
              <p>(iii) the poster entirely discounts the fact that operational conditions under combat fire affect a vehicle's SOP and management quite differently from normal situation.</p>
              <p>i.e , if you have a viking, you more or less know where the quirks/flaws/weaknesses are, rather than a untested/ unfamiliar platform whose reliability under combat strain and conditions are not known.</p>
              <p>i.e u cant compare operating lim chu kang Area D with Afghanistan Helmland province. you have so many other variables like</p>
              <p>-threat level</p>
              <p>-environmental</p>
              <p>-humidity</p>
              <p>and many others i cant be bothered to mention for the sheer straightfowardness of it.</p>
              <p>would they rather have a platform when the realize the 2nd vehicle/coupled module may roll over in battle conditions ? would they have a platform when they realise that the hydraulics may fail under certain temperature conditions ?</p>
              <p>combat proven and tested is a invaluable factor that shows that the platform is stable and tested and can be relied upon to function when called to duty. Why you make so much noise about Wedgetail and orphan platforms in the australia thread when you dont acknowledge the Bronco being in the same position ?</p>
              <p>why the bigotry lionnoisy ? why ? double- standards ? answer the fucking qn here.</p>
              <p>point (iv) no contest. its one of te selling points of the Bronco, modularity = versatality</p>
              <p>point (V) : i m sure that knowledgeable poster would be aware of that AMAP-ADS dosent come standard on all broncos.</p>
              <p>I m equally sure that the german IBD passive armour package is neither standard issue and is avaliable as a modular add on.</p>
              <p>suffice to say, its like saying, WOW, this car has all these accessories, but in reality, you have no interest in acquiring all of them. big deal really.</p>
              <p>ive rebutted your points and supposedly non "OFFICIAL CONFIRMATION AND PROOF" nonsense.</p>
              <p>now, tell me, whats a queene ? i m still eagerly awaiting that one. tell me the performance of the BvS 10 ?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>and yes you idiot, the Viking Mk2 can do all that and more. even the current viking can haul a SR mortar. simply proves my point you never ever read the links you post or what others post ?</p>
              <p>can the bronco haul an ATGM team behind ? is the Bronco Air conditioned ?</p>

              <p>The Bronco is not quite a competitor to the Bv206 market (which
                  number in the thousands).  Or even the BvS 10 for that matter
                  (which only number in the hundreds).</p>
              <p>True, they may have the same appearance but so does a 3-ton,
                  5-ton and 7-ton truck.</p>
              <p>Think of the Bv206 as the 3 tonner, the BvS10 as the 5 tonner
                  and the Bronco or Biking Mk2 as the 7 tonner</p>
              <p>The UK MoD is perhaps thinking that their current mix of 3 &amp;
                  5 tonners are not adequate to the task in Afghanistan and are
                  issuing a tender for a 7 tonner equivalent - either the Bronco or
                  the Viking Mk 2.</p>
              <p> </p>
              </div>
              <p>Viewed in this way, it's not quite the desperate fight for the
                  same pie.  A 2 ton payload ATTC is not going be in the same
                  market fight as the 5 ton payload </p>

              <p>right, i see, so the bit about logistics commonality is ovverated.</p>
              <p>i see what you mean about capacity/capability.fulfilling a niche ?</p>
              <p>I dont mean it in that sense, i was thinking in broader terms
                  about how the Bronco's entry represents a new competitor for Bae
                  hagglunds/ Bae Land systems.</p>
              <p>yes, the Bronco may fill a niche
                  now, but if it does well, it opens the doors to other variants and
                  other european countries. Its like a backdoor entry for ST eng into the
                  european market ? previouslly there wasnt really an alternative for the
                  other countries, e.g no Bv206, means going for BvS10.</p>
              <p>in that
                  sense ST eng is providing the consumer (all the other MODs) with an
                  alternative. The Bronco may be bigger and larger than the Bv206. but if
                  Lifetime costs and operational costs are affordable, it represents a
                  viable alternative to whatever Bae Has to offer?</p>
              <p>in that sense,
                  Bae's product "monopoly" could be broken. there is nothing quite
                  exactly in the category of Bv206/Bvs 10 and its possible Mk2 version
                  and the Bronco.</p>
              <p>i was suggesting the potential of ST eng breaking
                  into the category. But yes, i do acknowledge that the Bv206, BvS10 and
                  the bronco/BvS mk II are not substituable products. imperfect
                  substitues.</p>
              <p>using your tonner analogy, irregardless of the weight
                  class of a tonner, all 3 can fulfill logisitcal roles and purposes
                  right ? similarily the "class" of Bv206/Bvs10 and Bvs10 mk II/bronco
                  overlap more than they actually compete right ?</p>
              <p>in that sense,
                  yes while they are differntiated market products, they practically
                  fulfill the same role/function across the board ? 3 ton 5 ton 7 ton
                  each class got its limitations but all serve the function to varying degrees and limitations/</p>
              <p>the Bronco's ability to fulfill that function is the real threat to Bae's market share, not so much of its class or its niche</p>

              <p>30 tonnes ? thats 6X the payload of the Bronco.size wise would be a much much larger beast.</p>
              <p>plus, at that kinda weight, should definitely be not aircraft portable. unlikely to be amphibuous. thats one feature of the Bv206/BvS10 and Bronco class.</p>

              <p>The MoD recently contracted BAE Systems to undertake a reliability
              demonstration on a Viking in the United Kingdom. Working at a high
              gross weight, the vehicle is testing performance and reliability
              against various parameters.</p>
              <p>Data released by BAE in mid-November said the <strong>existing Viking's reliability under combat conditions stood at 88 percent.</strong></p>
              <p>The
              Mk II carries 12 crew and passengers, has a payload of 6 metric tons
              and a gross vehicle weight of 14.2 metric tons. The Bronco can fit in
              16 crew and passengers, has a gross weight of 18 metric tons and a
              payload of 6.8 metric tons.</p>
              <p>The Bronco vehicle is currently in service with Singapore's military, while the Viking Mk II is in development.</p>
              <p><strong>Release
              of the performance comparison between the Viking Mk II and the Bronco
              vehicle was part of a rearguard action by BAE to salvage a deal for
              around 100 vehicles, which was heading Singapore's way.</strong></p>
