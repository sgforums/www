            <div class='col-md body'>By 116 A.D, Roman Emperor Trajan have led his legions all the way to the east  and had captured the Parthian City of Susa. Trajan planned to continue advancing, inspired by the footsteps of Alexander the Great, with the intention of marching all the way to India and turning it into another Roman province.<br><br>Unfortunately he died on his campaign before he can realised this dream. What the Romans do not know that at this furthest extent, the Roman Legions was only within a day march to the nearest Han Chinese military outpost, set up earlier by Chinese General Ban Chao, who had lead the Chinese armies furthest to the west to Parthia, were used to secure and control local region.<br><br>At that time, both Han and Roman Empires were the most powerful political entities on Earth. Both possesses vast numbers of excellently well-equipped and well trained disciplined soldiers.<br><br>The Roman legions depends on its heavily armoured disciplined legionnaries and its formations, while the Chinese uses its armoured horsemen and infantry equipped with advanced missile weapons such as the crossbow (Which the Han Chinese were already expert in using) for its advantages on field.<br><br>What I would really want to know and find out, if both armies were commandered by excellent generals, what would the outcome on the battlefield be between the seemly evenly-matched forces?

            <div class='col-md body'>My conclusion is how a thin, far stretched expediting Army in a totally new terrain to win an Army bigger, well organized, already operated in that area for hundreds of years?<br><br>General Ban Chao is a greatest Chinese commander that fought Huns, the Chinese army deployed there usually in hundreds of thousand and they operated there since 220BC when Emperor Qin united whole China. Because of the Han ArmyÂ’s strong hold and persistence, a usually hard fighting, tough ranger like Huns even canÂ’t make a life in their ancient land therefore, eventually, after centuries fighting with Chinese, they had to emigrate to west, and once settled in the Eurp-land, they took the new continent by storm force the Saxons moving west and settled  a then desert  island now we call England.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I would say that the hans will win the war because the hans had the benefit of their homeground where they don't have to worry abt food supplies and have their castle or gate to get the upper hand , the romans side they have such heavy armour , i don't think they are that agile and they also have to think abt their own food supplies as the hans could cut off their supply of food by surrounding them and chinese very long ago already been expert of archery liao . Who wants to fight so close when you can just shoot them from above ? if water guns had been invented that time , maybe the hans just have to squirt oil on the romans n shoot fire arrow at them <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz">.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>In your scenario,..The Romans will be fighting just a Han Military outpost, which would not be more than 200.. and the Han empire is a tad too far to reinforce them. The Roman will have them piece meal..<br><br>However, this would spark a major military response, not seen .. since the mobilisation of the Han's army against the XiongNu (Huns). Then the subsequent battle will tilt towards the Hans.. who have a larger army strength, crossbows, composite bows, sieging weapons and heavy calvaries.<br><br>The largest Army the Roman has were just 70,000... even if they moblise all their regional defense force.. it's still too few. And their vassal state aren't exactly loyal.. they were just militarily subdued by the Romans.<br><br>You have to note that even though the Romans infantry were heavily armoured, (the hans are similarily armoured ) the Parthia war has shown that the Romans were shocked that their armour couldn't stop their Arrows.. that where the superority composite bows of the Hans comes in.<br><br>I would say that the Hans will win in long term.. They have both natural and  human resources.. that the Romans to not..<br><br>also we have to talk logistics.. something the Hans has but distance is also their achellies heels.. If the war requires them to advance pass today's thru XinJiang and Afghanistan into the Middle east</div>

Those who doubt can buy a airticket to Chinese city of Xian and pay a visit to the Terracotta Warriors which all in heavy armor.<br><br>For the offence side, then Chinese were in absolute advantage. Romans still rely solely on their Melee fight, Chinese already developed bronze Crossbow which can pierce several layers of Iron with easy and a range up to 500meters!<br><br>Check this out:<br><br><a href="http://www.atarn.org/chinese/bjng_xbow/bjng_xbow.htm" rel="nofollow">Ancient Crossbow with Some Unique Features from China</a><br><br>Talking about Tactics, Even in 117AC, Chinese army already been guided by Sun tzeÂ’s Â“ Art of the war Â“, which until now still been used by modern army like the US forces in Iraq.<br></div>

When deployed in such a way, the legionaries became virtually invulnerable to arrows or objects dropped from defensive walls.<br><br><img src="http://www.roman-empire.net/army/pics/wedge-01.jpg"><br><br>The wedge was an aggressive formation used to 'crack open' enemy lines. Relatively small groups of legionaries could form such a triangle and then drive their way into the enemy ranks. As more Roman soldiers reinforced the wedge from behind, the enemy line could be forced apart. As breaking the enemy's formation was very often the key to winning a battle, the wedge formation was vitally important battlefield tactic of the Roman army<br><br><img src="http://www.roman-empire.net/army/pics/skirmishing-01.jpg"><br><br>skirmish<br><br><img src="http://www.roman-empire.net/army/pics/repel-cavalry.jpg"><br><br>The order to repel cavalry by Roman army officers brought about a defensive formation, in which the front rank formed a tight wall of shields with their pila protruding to form a line of spearheads ahead of the wall. Undoubtedly it would be very hard to bring a horse to break into that formation. The most likely occurrence would be that it would come to a halt of its own will ahead of the spearheads. It was at that moment that horse and rider would be at their most vulnerable against the ranks behind the first line of infantry which would then hurl their spears at them. Given the short distance and the training legionaries received, it is likely such halted cavalry, frantically trying to turn their horses around to retreat, whilst colliding with horses following in the charge, would prove very easy targets.<br>If one further considers the likely possibility of archers being present, as is the case on the photo above, the effect of this formation could indeed be devastating.<br><br><img src="http://www.roman-empire.net/army/pics/orb-01.jpg"><br><br>The orb was a defensive formation in the shape of a complete circle which could be taken by a unit which had either become detached from the army's main body and had become encircled by the enemy, or a formation which might be taken by any number of units if the greater army had fallen into disorder during a battle.<br>It can hence be seen as a formation representing a desperate 'last stand' by units of a collapsing army. But also it can be seen as a disciplined holding position by a unit which has been divided from the army's main body in battle and which is waiting for the main force to rejoin them.<br>In either case, it is not a formation one would like to find oneself in, as it obviously indicates that they are surrounded by the enemy.<br>Naturally any officers or archers would be positioned in the centre of the orb.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>A few more points to add...<br><br>The entire Roman army at Trajan's times (At the height of its power) is only 1/5 the size of Han Chinese army.<br><br>Han Chinese generals studied Arts of War...they have very advanced missile weapons like the crossbow, which hav no problems penetrating any thick iron plates, fast rate of fire and with precision too (Which is also better than the Medieval European's ones). Not to mention they have heavily armoured calvary too.</div>

Once Roman concentrate their Troops to their border to fight the Hans.. The Roman Empire would most likely disintegrate within, as they don't exactly have a loyal Alliance making up their Empire.. who were always jumping from one rebellion to another. However, with the Roman Army occupied in a major war.. many rebellion will surface everywhere.</div>
