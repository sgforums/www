We have had this Australian version of the original Austrian AUG for the better part of 20 years and only the adequate training of our personnel has countered its less than reasonable performance in the field. The Australians are currently looking for a more satisfactory replacement. So should we. Fogging optics, junk magazines and a barrel that can not sustain a reasonable rate of automatic rifle and fallible safety mechanisms are just some of the issues with this rifle.  ................  purchasing the M16A4 or similar would be wise. This is the most recent rifle in the M16 family.  One aspect of the F88 Steyr can be summed up by an actual order by the Australian Army, order No. 7196-94 which indicated that the Steyr should not be used on rapid fire for long because plastic parts melted.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>AUG has its set of problems! I have a AUG-A2 and occasionally the firing pin will come off the gun! literally! and another problem I have is somtime the empty cartridge will get stuck and eats into the plastic near the ejection area! kind of the bolt slamming onto a hot emties during ejection and it got caught and force into the plastic stock during ejection.<br><br>I guess M4 might be the alternative! but the short 14.5" barrel would be a big disadvantage since comapring to a 20" barrel, the 5.56 needed the extra barrel to give the performance and magic of the 5.56.. with the 14.5 barrel! the M4 is reduce to a 200 meter rifle instead of a 500 meter using M855 with a 20" barrel! the AUG does have the advantage of short and still retains the 20" barrel.did not know that the AUG magazine is that weak! I always felt it is a better design to our M16 mags until the HK M16 mags came out!<br><br>Maybe the AUGA3 will have that improvement ! who knows!!<br><br>DaveC</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>A chamber explosion for the AUG is deadly... it's not a rifle you want to be using when it happens.<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by Shotgun:</div><div class="quote_body">I guess they are not very concerned about having that 500meter range.

The M-4 barrel reduces the range over this effect can be generated due to its lower MV. That might be an issue. Shooting through cover at targets behind is already an issue with 5.56mm and the M-4's barrel does not help things.<br><br>Depends on your tool for the job and how you are willing to work with certain compromises. My rifle of choice for FIBUA would be the SAR-21 because generally it's a more reliable weapon then the M-16 and offers the hitting power of a full sized 5.56 barrel in a compact package that makes it really good for FIBUA.<br><br>The scope, if mastered allows you to aquire and engage targets faster then traditional iron-sights and gives you more situtational awareness as well (if you shoot with both eyes open, which is a feat that's very next to impossible with iron sights).<br><br>The tradeoff if of course, a slightly longer reload time.

            <div class='col-md body'>YEs.. the M4 14.5 " barrel does not do well in Iraq and Afganistan becasue it is fundamentally reducing the magic of the 5.56! a typical 20" barrel will give you 3100 fps on a green tip M855 or SS109! whereelse the M4 14.5" barrel reduces that to almost 2700 fps! 5.56 losses its magic below 2500 fps and thus an M4 would be effective to 200 meter or less.<br><br>if they want a 14.5 barrel for compactness maybe the 6.8mm SPC or go with a better bullet like the 77 grain 5.56 .. that will stillmretain the performace of the bullet yet can use a shorter barrel!  of course that will mean controllability of the weapon since the bigger bullet usually cognotate to higher recoil and all that.<br><br>Dave C</div>

But if that guy is bare, as in no BA, the effect is somewhat opposite. Instead of killing the target, the ammo. actually gives the effect of sticking the target with an ice pick or something.

            <div class='col-md body'>for the SS109 or M855 yes! it either has the harden steel or tungsten penetrator ! The US M855 is a hardened steel!  does the same effect! the 62 grain M855 still fragment but has to have enough velocity to do that! the threshold seems to stay at 2700 fps!<br><br>Assuming true M193 or M855 ammo, velocity is the key.  Velocity is dependent on barrel length and environmental conditions.<br><br>As barrel length increases, the bullet is propelled faster by the expanding gasses in the barrel, imparting more velocity on the bullet, resulting in a longer range before a fired bullet drops below 2700 fps.  A shorter barrel imparts less velocity, and therefore the bullet has less range.<br><br>Temperature, altitude and humidity are other factors.  As temperature or altitude increases, air becomes less dense and bullets travel faster.  Contrary to common conceptions, as humidity increases air also becomes less dense and helps bullets retain velocity.<br><br>It is important, then, to keep in mind that any statistics given can only be approximate and can be affected by a wide range of factors.  But as a baseline, these numbers are what you could expect for 75Â° F, 25% humidity, at sea level, from various barrel lengths:<br><br>Distance to 2700 fps       55 grain M193                ss109 or M855<br>20" Barrel                    190-200 m                            140-150m<br>16" Barrel                     140-150m                            90-95m<br>14.5" Barrel                     95-100m                             45-50m<br>11.5" Barrel                     40-50m                                 12-15m<br><br>As you can see, barrel length and ammo selection make a major impact on fragmentation range.<br><br>However, the M855 will penetrate better than say a M80 7.62x51mm ball at 600 meter on a M1 Steel helemet ! it will go thru both ways! thats of course with a 20" barrel rifle!<br><br>DaveC<br></div>
