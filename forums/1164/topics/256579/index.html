            <div class='col-md body'>During the recent Lebanon war, IDF is suspected to has fired missiles( Spike ER?) using  their UAV against enemy targets.<br><br>The most likely suspect is the Hermes 450 as reported here:<br><br><a href="http://www.aviationweek.com/aw/generic/story_generic.jsp?channel=awst&amp;id=news/aw082106p2.xml" rel="nofollow">http://www.aviationweek.com/aw/generic/story_generic.jsp?channel=awst&amp;id=news/aw082106p2.xml</a><br><br><blockquote>But toward the end of the conflict, few missiles were fired from UAVs during the daytime, and they were spotted by ground observers. A least one of them claimed he was in a convoy of civilian automobiles that was attacked.<br><br>As recently as June, Israeli aerospace industry officials said the decision had not been made to arm the UAVs for political reasons. IAF officials simply would not discuss the capability. Israeli industry officials said the first UAV designed to carry and launch missiles would not be rolled out for another 18 months. That may be true in a strict sense, but it's now known that an "already-developed [UAV] capability," was adapted to fire missiles in this latest conflict, says an Israeli official with insight into the effort.<br><br><strong>Details are still sketchy about which aircraft was used. Several officials in Israel say the armed UAVs are not Israel Aircraft Industries' Heron, which just became operational in July, nor the longer-serving Searcher II. The only other operational UAV deemed big enough to carry an effective weapons payload is Elbit's Hermes 450. </strong>The Hermes 450 was seen in flight in 2002 at Palmachim AB, where it was being operated by 200 (UAV) squadron. The IAF has always been guarded about the UAV's mission and status. The military said it was only in a test program, but aerospace industry officials contradicted them, saying that the Hermes 450 was already flying operational missions.......................<br><br>To answer those needs, Rafael developed the Spike-ER (extended-range) missile, with a range of about 5 mi., that offers a dual electro-optical and infrared seeker to help locate concealed targets (AW&amp;ST June 16, 2003, p. 151). Another advantage over the Hellfire is that the Spike can be flown into the target by an operator, or it can be operated as a fire-and-forget system.<br><br>In fact, Rafael has devised several air-launched configurations for Spike-ER, including a four-pack launcher for use on such attack helicopters as the Cobra, but also two-pack versions for smaller rotorcraft. <strong>A Hermes 450, with a payload capacity of around 150 kg. (330 lb.), is able to carry two missiles with launcher equipment.............. </strong><br><br></blockquote></div>

This it make a very good vehicle for monitoring and searching for mobile targets and designating them and taking them out.<br><br>While the MAV is for fast in and out, as its type of engine will burn up fuel too fast, it is not for loitering and range will be more less then hermes !

The type is in service with the Israeli Air Force and is on order for the British Army.<br><br>Undeclared operators include Botswana, which has had a small number of aircraft in service for at least two years.<br><br>Â“The introduction of the Hermes 450 UAV offers an enhancement to our battlefield surveillance capability with its extended endurance, advanced avionics and sensorsÂ” says Teo.<br><br>The announcement, made 25 May, came in parallel to Singapore formally standing up its new UAV command with personnel drawn from the army, navy and air force units.<br><br>A Hermes 450 was displayed at that ceremony however it remains unclear whether this was a demonstrator system or an initial delivery article.<br><br>Â“The UAV command has been constituted as an integrated entity,Â” Teo said.<br><br>Â“This allows UAV-borne capabilities to be effectively integrated and optimised for use when needed by forces from all the three services.<br><br>"The UAV command covers the whole of the Singaporean armed forces.Â”<br><br>The Hermes 450 is a medium size UAV used to supply real time intelligence data to ground forces. The UAV is 6.1m long and has a wingspan of 10.5m.<br><br>Maximum take-off weight is 450kg. It is powered by a 52hp rotary UEL engine that provides a maximum speed of 95 KTAS and it has an endurance of over 20h.</div>
