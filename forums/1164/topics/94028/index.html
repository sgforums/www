            <div class='col-md body'>I heard from my friend who is serving in the Navy said that the Lafayeete class France sold to Singapore is actually smaller than her cousins in the Taiwanese and the Saudi Arabian Navies, France sold the first frigates to Saudi Arabia, then to Taiwan. The length of her bow of Taiwanese is shorter than the Saudi Arabia and in term longer than the Singapore version, which this case the Taiwanese Lafayette is bigger than us! Anyway I prefer the Denmark's Thetis class frigates though, with her damn super-strong structure..</div>

Take the Sawari class for example, although it's hull is much longer than the Deltas, our Deltas possess much firepower than the Sawari. The Sawari have the Arabel 3D radar while our Deltas are designed with the Herakles 3D radar which is much capable. The Sawari have room for onli 2 Eight-cell Slyver launcher while our Deltas are armed with 4 Eight-cell launcher with possible option for better Slyver variants. Lets not forget that our Deltas are designed primarily with Radar, Acoustic, Magnetic signature control in mind. Looking at the super structure of the ship, our Deltas is apparently more stealthy.</div>

It generate a lot of interest, especially with Taiwan suing the french over overpricing and bribes of getting their frigates.<br><br>All those post do agree on one thing, yes our frigate is built smaller - the reason it is to be the most stealth version of all and the most lethal armed version too.<br><br></div>
