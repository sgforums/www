            <div class='col-md body'>Lately, I visit the ST technologies webby and I notice something veri interesting. I notice that the advertisements for the LWSPH, FH-88, 81m stealth corvettes are gone. Does this means ST do not produce equipment of older design. For example, FH2000 is more advance that the FH88, thus they  stop producing the FH88? Recently, at the aerospace show, they seems to have introduce 2 new types of corvettes namely a 85m and a 57m one, which seems to me to have stealth features influenced by the visby of Sweden , does this means ST have chosen smaller vessels to follow the Visby type of design rather than the La fayettes?</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>u meant the fuze on the 155mm ERBB round?<br><br>From where did u get that info from? I think they came up with that reason to stop the finger pointing between the heavy armt techs and ammo techs.<br>Investigations from my side stated that it was the charge that is used to propel the round out of the barrel was not properly kept and had been exposed to extensive moisture. Thus some chem reaction took place in the charge, resulting in a far larger explosive gas buildup in the breech.<br><br>Well, thats what i was told la. might be right might be wrong.<br><br></div>
