That is why I believe there has been extensive survey done to find out what kinda soil, terrain features are prevalent in whichever part of operations area.<br><br>With proper OPs, and defence lay out, the MBT can form a defensive strong point in any urban area.  The MBT's main gun, is also capable of engaging fortifications, bunkers and "garrisonned" buildings in urban warfare.<br><br>Then again, I'm not expert in employing MBTs.  I just know that it can be done, in the right places.</div></blockquote>thats correct. the soil conditions of the region is probably well documented with up to date satellite photos. recce units like scouts and LRRP will prob in indian country ahead of the main force to confirm the ground conditions and identify defences in the AO.<br><br>the use of MBT, in the right way, will probably shorten the fight. one possible scenario will be for the light tanks and infantry to hold the front while the MBTs, with support from heliborne forces, spear thru the defences and seize keep MSR and supply route. with the MBT in place to hold them, this will allow the force to hold the ground while enemy forces runs out of supply.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Well you see, given the local terrain over possible advance routes,  it makes more sense to have more APC/IFVs with their infantry than light tanks.  Though tanks are supposed to be able to clear difficult terrain more effectively than wheeled vehicles, they are also more vulnerable and less effective.  Narrow fronts, and insufficient width to form a line would reduce their ability to project firepower forward.<br><br>Infantry however, maybe a bit slower, but is able to make better use of available cover of the terrain, fan out and project their firepower across the front.  And of course, it goes without saying, that the AI is also able to dig in more effective than armor, freeing up their LTs and IFVs to lead local counter attacks or flank.</div>
