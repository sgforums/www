            <div class='col-md body'>There is  a role in SEA for each - MBT and Light Tanks.  My opinion is that S'pore should have a "hi"  / " lo "  mix  - both   MBTs and light tanks - but don't we already have this mix ?  We only need to get them replaced.<br><br>With a small number of tankees , MBTs will ensure that tank crew casualties are minimized to fight another day in a high intensity battle. Easier to replace an MBT than a well trained &amp; experienced  tank crew. Light tanks shoud be used for supporting role in a battle - recon , screening , fire support etc.<br><br>Small number of MBTs ( 1 to 2 battalions ) and light tanks ( 3 to 5 battalions )<br>including reserves will be good.  Good and realistic training will be better.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Shoot n sink, haha, very funny...<br><br>Those pics of the M1 are actually the same vehicle. They are just arranged in opposite order.

In war time their ability to be rapidly deployed as compared to the tracked vehicles is definitely an asset when deployed for surprise rear  hit and run attacks.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"> </div></blockquote>Perhaps SAF might consider an amphibious Terrex, one with water jet propulsion to arm the 21DIV, thus forming a battalion size mechanised troops that can be inserted to supplement fire power of the Guardsmen and also help securing, clearing the coastal region for friendly to land. Get a 105mm Variant and a 30mm cannon variant.<br><br>Sometimes I think why SAF die die must have a 120mm for the new LT can't the 105mm do the trick. I mean it is still quite potent.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I agree that for a light tank a  105 mm gun will suffice. Also, it can carry more rounds &amp; stay in the fight longer - but keep it away from an MBT. Anyway carry two or three rounds of latest 105 mm APFSDS rounds for self defence against an MBT.<br><br>However, to kill a modern MBT, make available a few options - AH64, Spike,  Maverick, LGBs and to top it off a battalion or two of own MBTs with 120 mm will do the trick.</div>
