Cos plantation soil is firm enough to support armor operations due to the palm trees that are rooted there, holding the soil together.  If there is a place where heavy armored vehicles can operate and manuever quickly in peninsular malaysia, its in the plantations.<br><br>We are not gonna transport our AMX-13s or BX by C-130.  Cos we don't intend to deploy them anywhere else.<br><br>And the Stryker, last i heard, had to be STRIPPED down to fit into the aircraft anways.  Which means, after landing, they still have fix in all the externals before its combat ready.  That was one of the main arguement the "pro-heavy" US Tankees threw up.  They felt that M1A1s could roll off the C-5s and be battle ready as soon as the MGs r mounted up, tank fueld, and ammo loaded.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>i don't suppose class 30 trackway restriction will be a problem for employing MBT in SAF. employment of class 30 are mainly for improvement of roadway where they cannot be passable by wheeled vehicles. as someone else has mentioned, tracked vehicles are designed for muddy terrain. they have much lower ground pressure than a wheel vehicle.<br><br>ever see a human bogged down in a muddy terrain but a much heavier tracked plant has no ptoblem traversing the place? bridges in our inventory also don't pose a problem. the majority of them are all MLC 60, probably capable of MLC 70 as caution crossing. bridge like FLB are designed in Germany for german army, on the pictures u see on Mindef's website, u can see a leopard crossing the bridge.<br><br>combat engineer vehicle &amp; AVLB are all organic to armour units, they are all based on M60 MBT chassis. if our current asset can support them, i don't see why MBT cannot be deployed. its probably just a matter of politics and strategy.<br><br>i'm not a field engineer expert, so correct me if i'm wrong about the class 30.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>For watever MBTs u have, u can always get AVLB(that handles its weight) for it.....Length might be problem....Unless u can wait for CE to come help....The whole point of having AVLB is to bridge gap ASAP without CE help n then quickly move on. Weight limit of road bridges is more of a concern i think when 30 ton requirement is set. If u can use road bridges that's already there u could move faster then having to set up your own...Just cross any u see... N if u r lighter there's more bridges u can use.... 3m width maybe ship cargo hold limit(not sure,any navy guys?), but maybe also road width....Your tanks too wide road becomes narrow,so all move in column.....Smaller width tanks can move in other formations.....Becomes nice target when in column....</div>

I was from CE, and seriously speaking.  The CL30 trackway theoretically can be deployed to handle wider vehicles as well.  But yes, the prev bridges were limited in terms of width.  Still, those floating bridges we have are not meant to be "permanent."  Finally, its still the big wide barges does the bulk of the movement.<br><br>However, like one of the forumites mentioned, the trackways are for wheelies. I remember we used them by the shore when deploying pontoons and tugboats.  If not, the stupid 7-tonne might just slip into the water due to the muddy shore.<br><br>I've never been in armor, but I was a frequent visitor to S.Gedong.  I've never heard of my friends in armor talking about trying to shove the Bx in a -130 before.  However, i did kinda remember seeing some Bx like vehicle roll out of the -130 bay a long time ago.

            <div class='col-md body'>shotgun, i think moca may not be referring to your comments but someone else instead.. but just in case moca is referring to you, i can only add that if SAF has tinker about the possibility of air-lifting armour unit, air-strips to land the transport will defintely be required. either drop in a Bn of commandos to capture it, modify the NS highway for emergency runway or have 1 constructed in place. the cost in terms of resources is prob too high as compared to making do with just grounded armour units. as suggested in Tim Huxley's book, we are expected to hold the ground of about 40km, maybe slightly more with the introduction of astros. we are not looking at an AO of 100 miles x 100 miles where air-lifting armour will be important.<br><br>but what you say is absolutely right, the CEV is always used for bridge testing, tonnes of pictures with CEV on our bridges are around, i have a few personnal ones too. its probably the heaviest vehicle in our offical inventory but if it can pass, so do other vehicles.<br><br>i don't think the 3m, 30 tonnes restriction is offically supported anywhere. we have vehicles that exceed 3m (VLB @ 4.5m width), or wheeled 30 tonnes (comet @ MLC42). Even transporters doon't pose a problem for the width, D8 plant is often transported on a low-bed, the width of the blade is more than 3m wide, need escort when travelling on public road..<br><br>i don't think this info is public domain &amp; i also cannot remember it anyway, the width of the MSER and ASER is definitely enough to support the movement of MBT class size of vehicles..</div>

Even transporters doon't pose a problem for the width, D8 plant is often transported on a low-bed, the width of the blade is more than 3m wide, need escort when travelling on public road..<br><br>i don't think this info is public domain &amp; i also cannot remember it anyway, the width of the MSER and ASER is definitely enough to support the movement of MBT class size of vehicles.. </div></blockquote>Yeah, i get what u mean.  But to the best of available common knowledge, this capability is still experimental.  Perhaps soon enough, we'd have an operational unit with such a purpose in mind, but as of now, I haven't heard much of it.<br><br>In anycase, officially, the capability to capture and air lift armored vehicle is still  "not there" hence, it would not be logical to deduce that the 3m by 30ton restriction is for such a purpose.<br><br>Also, since most of our bridges are capable of handling the CEV, a much larger vehicle.  Its not likely that the "3m by 30ton" restriction is due to our bridges.  If the Air and Sea factor ruled out, there only remains the Land factor.<br><br>What we know:<br>Majority of our armored vehicles, M113 ULtra, OWs, Bx 40/50, 25mms fall (the vehicles we have in large numbers) are in this category.  Of course, AFVs of this type mostly fall into this width weight cat.<br><br>And also, the BX based AVLBs, still actually have the same track width as the usual BX.<br><br>Yes, i agree that we have vehicles that are outside this 3m by 30ton Class of combat vehicles.  Though I would not consider the comet "combat." It is noted that those vehicles that form the "tip of the spear" of the SAF Armor,  generally do reside in that category.  In anycase, the CEV, Comet etc, are not SAF Armor's equipment.  They are under the Combat Engineers.  CEV under Armored Engineers.<br><br>With the exception of the "Big Brothers", I think there are few vehicles in SAF Armor that exceed that category.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Maybe we r making sure we can make use of this:<br><br><blockquote>WW2:Germany found that by spearheading assaults with panzer regiments to bust through an opponents line, they could cut supply lines, quickly take control of key bridges, cities, etc., and create sheer havoc behind an enemies front line. Germany used the Ardennes forest in the Battle of France to hide nearly all of their panzer divisions, a forest the French thought was unpassable to armored forces. Germany proved France wrong, and with a feint to the north, drawing French and British troops that way, Germany countered to the south, through the Ardennes with a quick thrust behind and into the back of those same troops. German panzer divisions quickly took key bridges and quickly cut supply lines. Most French forces were so surprised to see the Germans moving so quickly that they surrendered rather than fight. The French army was not a match for the German Army because of misallocation of armor, and the fact that they fell right into Germanys hands by overstretching their forces by putting reserves into one massive move to the north. The French had even built up a massive defensive structure called the Maginot Line, just south of the Ardennes. This structure held even more men who could have been used to defend the 2 attacks further north, but Germany had plans for these men, and had the 1st Army attack the Maginot Line with a small force to pin these men down and keep them from acting as reserves. The French Army was cut to pieces, and the British Expeditionary Force could only retreat to Dunkirk</blockquote> If your armour too big n heavy don't think this could be done<br><br>The rest of the vehicles not so restricted cos Armour's the spearhead right?</div>

My apologies if it sounded harsh.<br><br>To sum up what I basically pointed out.<br><br>-AFVs in SAF Armor are the ones largely under 3m and 30 tons.<br><br>-CEVs, AVLBs, etc are not under SAF Armor.<br><br>-CE Bridging assets can handle adequately vehicles above 3m and 30 tons.  So the general trend of 3m n 30 ton for AFVs in Armor is not due to limitations of our bridging capabilities.<br><br>-Air Lifting A-Veh is still not an official capability nor was it something we had since we had the M113s and SM-1s.  Hence, it was probably not a restriction we imposed concerning the fitting of the vehicles into the C-130 bay.<br><br>-As someone noted, our Navy landing craft is not known to carry any veh heavier than 18 ton?  (THis one i'm not sure)<br><br>On the other hand, what I do know is<br><br>-3m width can fit thru plantation tree planting distances comfortable, and retain relatively high degree of agility.  As with shorter barrels. (told to me by my mates in armor)<br><br>-30 ton weight is also comfortable handling for the firmer plantation soils.  No doubt plantation soil can also support MBT operation,  just that the MBT would not be as mobile there.<br><br>-Some bridges up north may not be safely constructed to allow anything heavier than 30 ton possibly.<br><br>-And of course, the lighter the vehicle,  the less intensive the recovery job.  Example, a tank 60 ton ++ getting stuck in a deep ditch would require at least another 60+ ton recovery vehicle.  Question is, is the terrain favorable for another heavy duty recovery vehicle to do its job?</div>
