Who in their right mind will replace a light tank with a MBT man. Personally I think the only reason the Mindef report mentioned the AMX-13s is because our Centurions are still very sensitive.

            <div class='col-md body'>That's a possibility... but come to think of it shouldn't we be using our Tempests for what the SM1 is doing? Now that we got the Cat?<br><br>Hard to say leh, seriously the SM1 are not doing much even in our current armour formations. After all the tatics were written around its limitations, I don't think the AT duties would actually fall on it in actual ops, it's just too slow and vulnerable.<br><br>Then again, we can't realistically expect to replace all 300+ SM1s in short order, there are crews to retrain and tatics to rewrite.

            <div class='col-md body'>Actually, I think the centurions got other uses such as we can modify them to become ARV or bridge-layer. We could also turn them into urban warfare vehicles like putting a remote controlled 25mm auto-canon on it,and create some space to file in at least 4 AIs. We could even make a 52 cal SPG by mounting a FH2000 gun on it.<br>For the AMX-13, we can turn them into armoured recon vehicles by removing the main gun and fitting an auto-canon. We could also make them into our organic PDF division as a armoured force. A coastal defense force can be set up by mounting a 120mm mortar or perhaps make it into something like the Jadpanther of the WW2</div>

The next phase will be to replace the SM1s.<br><br>In truth, one needs both types to do different jobs in different scenarios. Having both MBTs and LTs is ideal ( and costly ) but it gives flexibility in any given scenario.<br><br>Also, light tanks have very limited  success in real wars - it is usually the medium and heavy tanks that are more effective.  Also, with modern man portable AT weapons which are so easily &amp; readily available , LTs are extremely vulnerable.

            <div class='col-md body'>LTs are only useful if doctrine states that you are always moving under deep growth o r cover, therefore, the size and profile is very important.

In fact, Jungles are perfect hiding places for infantry, and just imagine them waiting to ambush and let loose a volley of many many anti-tank missiles. Some of the latest Russian anti-tank missiles can dent the Merkava and destroy/disable. Have no delusions about them tearing our Leopard 2s apart with ease.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Sending tanks into a jungle is generally a bad idea, be you in a LT or not. In that area tanks serve more for fire support then actual armour assualt.<br><br>Not sure about Meky being the most heavily armoured tank in the word, given its spaced configuration means that it can survive and reduce damage from hits after being penetrated which other tanks might not. The Cat relies on a more conventional method of preventing penetration altogeher, so how it responds to ATGM will be a different ball game. I don't think it will be "easily" torn apart ala. T-72 though, unless you are talking the later generation ATGMs.</div>

I was actually more under the impression that the SAF would try out that concept with the Bionix, i.e. fit a 120mm cannon like the one used in the CV90, or a L7 105mm cannon (there is an Israeli round that claims to have similar performance characteristics to the 120mm rounds).<br><br>But they seem to have decided it was high time to get a heavy hitter, obviously geared for urban warfare.
