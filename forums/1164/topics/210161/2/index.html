Perhaps LT are generally more nimble due to their small size so they can hide, manovuer well in our terrain?<br><br>Or could it be perhaps this "MBT not suitable for SEA nations........" was merely a smoke screen taught to our tankees to mask our interest or inventory of MBT from the northern chaps?</div>

I don't think so.<br><br>I won't argue that the Centurion will be like a "bull in a china shop" once INSIDE the plantation. But to say that a Bionix or M113 can travel through a plantation that's too narrow for a Centurion is pure speculation. 60cm is gonna make that big a difference in a rubber plantation? C'mon.<br><br>Based upon the numbers, I must say width-wise, where the AMX-13-SM1, M113, Bionix etc can go, so, too, can the Centurion.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>If you're saying that I am purely speculating about the plantation thing, you're mistaken.  This was something that I learnt to my surprised whilst interacting with some of my friends in Armor units. Perhaps a centurion would fit OKAY with a little distance for clearance, but would that small clearance make it easy to manuever?<br><br>Stop picking on fussy details and making impractical comparisons like, "Why don't we fly Biplanes instead of F-16s."  Tanks run on fuel, and if we are gonna run down every damn tree we see, its probably gonna limit the length of time we can operate.  War fighting is not just about taking land and shooting big guns.  There is a cost to war, and that cost will affect the sustainability of the campaign.<br><br>I'm not saying that cos of "Fuel Economy" we'll trade in MBTs for Land Rovers.  I'm saying is that, why have a tank rev- its engines like mad to thru difficult terrain, when you don't really absolutely have to?<br><br>I didn't even comment about the  "tanks were made for MUD." Most of the evolution of MBT took place in Europe, in the 2nd WW and in anticipation of the Cold War.  They did not have terrain and the kinda red-softee-landslide-mud we have in Peninsula Malaysia, nor the kinda average rain fall we recieve annually.  Nor did they have virtually impassable jungles.<br><br><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de8vL1QMQLg" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de8vL1QMQLg</a><br><br>Given such situations, where tanks have to travel down muddy jungle tracks with this kinda huge MBT sucking potholes in column formations, don't you think the tank could be used somewhere else with greater effect?<br><br>Again and again I say, the right tool, at the right place at the right time.  We don't charge every mud hill with an MBT cos "THEY ARE MADE FOR MUD."</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Moca or TVDog,<br><br>We have been talking abt the same issue just awhile back and you seem unable to be accept the concept of that many of these are actually conducted studies by professional military orgn like SAF and Brits army etc.<br><br>For example in WW2, the Brits army thought that armour was not effective in terrain in Malayan ,  and they believe that that Japs armour would have to travel down via truck roads system, therefore they setup fortification along those roads.<br><br>But the Jap used LT and light vehicles travelled thru rurul area and plantations and surprised the Brits.<br><br>After WW2, the Briits started R&amp;D for the Scorpion AFV family and since they are still fighting CT in Malayan, one of the requirement is that width must be small enough to manuerve effectively in rubber tree plantation!!!<br><br>If rubber tree plantation is not restrictive, then why bother setting up such requirement???<br><br>Lastly , SAF has width limitation of 3m , why???<br><br>Do you know if SAF dun bother abt that width limitation, then Primus would not have developed, becos we could get our hand on cheaper 2nd hand M109 which width is only 3.12m, just 12cm and yet SAF willing to pay more for newly developed Primus!!!<br><br>If you argument is based on LT vs MBT, then why is practically all countries with tropical rainforest still uses LT and not all MBT???<br><br>Especially countires like Thailand , Brazil, Argentina etc have both LT and MBT, why not all MBT, why not operate 100% MBT???<br><br>They have operate both type of vehicle in their own terrain , so they should be expert abt their own backyard!!!<br><br>Especially Thailand who has plenty of cheap 2nd hand MBT from US yet still buys brand new and expensive LT, why????<br><br>In fact, there is mkt of new LT for example Stingray, Ascord, CV90105, M8 etc, if there is no need for LT, then why so many new LT in the mkt???<br><br>Are you saying that all these countries armies and LT manufacturers are all wrong abt the usefulness of LT ???<br><br>Either you are wrong or all the above experts are wrong!!!<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>A very interesting vehicle development to read about is that of the little-known Brazilian private venture MBT EE-T1 OsÃ³rio.<br><a href="http://www.fprado.com/armorsite/EE-T1-Osorio.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.fprado.com/armorsite/EE-T1-Osorio.htm</a><br><br>This is however, a cancelled project and its development even bankrupted the company that developed it called Engesa. Am not recommending this tank, just that its development and eventual failure is a rather sad and sobering story.<br><br>"The development of this MBT also reflects the inherent difficulties facing a company based in the developing world in moving up the high-technology ladder to the production of more advanced weapon systems."<br><br>This could be the reason why STK never even bother to try and develop and sell MBT, as this category is simply too competitve and the best and most suitable product does not always win. As in all business, you need the right connections.<br><br>Like SG &amp; MY, Brazil is a tropical country. Of course, their Amazonian jungles are impassable to ANY types of vehicles and they have to keep to tracks or roads.<br><br>They are also a country with a poor rural area like MY ie bad roads and bridges etc.<br><br>Consequently, the Brazilian Army has rather stringent specs for a MBT.<br><br>As a result, the Osorio is one of the more compact MBT with a smoothbore 120mm gun.<br><br>It WON THE MBT EVALUATION TRIALS in Saudi Arabia and they annouced the plan to buy over 300 vehicles.<br><br>But Desert Storm 1991 broke out and as a debt to USA, Saudi dropped the Osorio for the M1A1. Even though it was already assessed that the M1A1 is too big and too heavy for even Saudi Arabia - a desert country.<br><br>The company filed for bankruptcy, laid off over 3,000 workers, end of story.</div>
