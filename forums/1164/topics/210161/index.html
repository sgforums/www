            <div class='col-md body'>Inevitably, in a discussion about tanks in Singapore, someone would mention that Singapore (and Malaysian) terrain is NOT suitable for MBT.<br><br>Some of the reasons cited is mud, jungle, plantations, bridges etc.<br><br>The most absurd argument is mud in SG, as the tank WAS INVENTED TO HANDLE MUD. As if our mud is different from their mud.<br><br>Personally, I think this is all rubbish as we have had the Centurion MBT for the last 30 years.<br><br>But can someone from the armour corps please determine if our terrain is indeed unsuitable for MBT? Did they tell you at armour school that SG is not suitable for MBT?<br><br>To give everyone a better idea for discussion here are the specs for both Centurion and AMX-13.<br><br>Centurion specs:<br>Length: 8.29 m<br>Width: 3.39 m<br>Height: 2.94 m<br>Weight: 56,000 kg<br><br>AMX-13 specs:<br>Length: 6.36 m (with gun forwards)<br>Width: 2.51 m<br>Height: 2.3 m<br>Weight: 15,000 kg (combat weight)</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Well there is no right or wrong answer to that . Because the whole singapore or malaysia terrain is different at different parts and season.<br><br>Look at singapore and malaysia, if urban area, there is away roads, thus MBT is alway suitable. But if you go into the jungle where unpave road, that does not mean the MBT cannot handle it.<br><br>But sometime if raining season + soft ground, that may be a problem to MBT.<br><br>The answer is MBT is alway suitable. But just when, where and how you deploy it , that make it suitable or not .  But sometime having a big gun does help when you need it.<br><br></div>

This is because we are not here to discuss tactics or strategy. If I'm not wrong, we are already operating Amroured Battle Groups, with our vast variety of different types of combat vehicles.<br><br>But the only thing that raises the most question is the MBT.<br><br>IMO the fighting capabilities of the MBT vs Light Tanks does not require any discussion. MBT is better, period. No light tank can hide or outrun a RPG. Our AMX-13 can be easily defeated by 25mm cannon or even a .5 firing SLAP rounds.<br><br>On the other hand, an MBT might still survive a RPG hit.<br><br>Secondly, some people are still doubtful as to whether we have an MBT. I'm in no doubt we in the form of the Centurion.<br><br>And thirdly, which is what this thread is about, is the frequently heard but completely unfounded argument that out terrain is not suitable for MBTs.<br><br>I am just wondering if this is what SAF armour school teaches? Or if this is just one of those rumours that seems to find favour with a lot of people.</div>

But the question is........<strong>R THEY FOR US? </strong>Do u want to cross that bridge whenever u 1 or do u want to detour n go the long way while your guys waited for your fire support? Or wait for ACE to help u? I mean 69 ton worth of firepower n protection is good to have. But is it suitable for us? If u read GW2 U.S report u find that they found out M1A1 too heavy to cross most of the bridges....N note that not all roads r built for "heavy" traffic of this kind.

            <div class='col-md body'>As you can see, the AMX-13, at only 17 tons, has nearly the same ground pressure as most MBT around 50 tons. Here's a list from lowest to highest. The M1A1 and Merkava are both around 0.9 something kg/cm2. Because I can't find a site with proper tables I didn't post them.<br><br>The surprise is that the 17 tons AMX-13 ground pressure is only 0.074kg less than the 52 ton Centurion. That's a minuscule difference considering the huge weight difference!!!<br><br>So terrain that will get the 62 ton Centurion bogged down will also stop the 17 ton AMX-13.<br><br><strong>So, please, no more talk about the MBT being stuck in mud and not Light tanks.</strong></div>
