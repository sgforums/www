Consider the fact that the Soviets deployed more than 5 types of anti-ship missiles of different ranges and capabilities in the 1980s. One may question the matter of support and logistics but missiles definitely are not as maintainence intensive as aircraft.<br><br>Harpoon missiles, being of American origin, arm the Fokker 50 MPA fleet which have a APS-134 search radar each. Integreting Exocets with the Super Pumas would be an easy process considering that both are of French origin.<br><br>Just an interesting point to share, the Aster 15 SAM is also a potent anti-ship weapon as it can fly a sea skimming profile at 4 times the speed of sound. Keep in mind that our Barak missiles have been tested against surface targets and have proven effective. Such concepts of using SAMs as short range anti-ship weapons will increase the surface warfare capabilities of many navies.<br><br></div>

If a Aster 15 missile can intercept incoming sea skimming missiles which travel from Mach 0.8 to 2.0 depending on the type, hitting an enemy ship which travels at most 40 knots would not present a problem at all. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br><br>You can look up on other naval SAMs too. The Americans are known to employ their Standard SM-1/2 SAMs as anti-surface weapons as well, so do the Russians with their SA-N-6 Grumble missiles.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Will it be a good idea to have both the Harpoons and another type of anti-ship missile (such as Exocets) in our arsenal? Reason being that if one type is being used, the enemy will be more likely to escape from an anti-ship missile attack once they have learned how to jam the guidance system. Having another type even in smaller quantities can act as a backup (such as being able to be deployed on the Seahawks which is in turn deployed from the frigates armed with Harpoons) should the first type failed. Of course this will bring about the problem of additional logistics and maintenance. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>hmm juz 2 cents of my opinion....another possible way of hitting a target is to design a missile dat not only skim to itz target but a min or at certain distance b4 the missile home in, an operator from the ship guide it to home in by having realtime camera which cuts off video tranmission seconds b4 hitting rather den it homes in by itself. This prevents the possibilty of the missile being electronically jammed by the ship to be hit. The only way such final operator guided missile can b defeated is thru CIWS. My guess an operator guided control might come cheaper den the final automated homing guidance system fitted into most cruising anti-ship missile.</div>

But that idea is certainly cool. I believe it will certainly happen in the near future(if it has`nt) just like the American Standard and Barak. Afterall, they`re in competition.<br>I would have preferred ESSMs and Standards for the Formidables but if i could hazard a guess, it`s probably to circumvent the Malaysians in buying the Asters. For the lack of a better choice, they are faced with a system already in used by a potential rival and a contemporary system in the ESSMs and Standards(probably never...) which they will find hard getting thier hands on; or just too cumbersome to maintain given the country of origin linked as it is to thier foriegn policies among others.<br><br>Im eagerly waiting for future add-ons on the Formidables though.</div>
