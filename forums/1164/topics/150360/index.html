            <div class='col-md body'>Just saw this this article that was just published by Flight International thru' Alert 5[url]<a href="http://www.flightinternational.com/Articles/2005/08/30/Navigation/190/201234/Singapore+closes+in+on+next-generation+fighter+.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.flightinternational.com/Articles/2005/08/30/Navigation/190/201234/Singapore+closes+in+on+next-generation+fighter+.html </a> Even though the winner is yet to-be announced, but it gives us a pretty good idea of the POSSIBLE winner.<br><br>Standby everyone, D-Day is end-Sep.<br><br><blockquote><strong>Singapore closes in on next-generation fighter </strong><br>BoeingÂ’s F-15T is favourite to beat Dassault Rafale, but decision could slip into 2006<br><br>Singapore is expected to select its next-generation fighter by the <strong>end of September</strong>, with BoeingÂ’s F-15T considered the frontrunner for the eight- to 12-aircraft requirement. Negotiations with the US manufacturer and French rival Dassault concluded about two months ago, resulting in preliminary contracts for the F-15T and Rafale.<br><br>Industry sources say a selection must be made by the end of September to preserve SingaporeÂ’s requirement for 2008 deliveries, but it could delay the acquisition until 2006 and settle for 2009 deliveries.<br><br>SingaporeÂ’s Defence Science &amp; Technology Agency has completed its evaluation of the F-15T and Rafale and is believed to be recommending the Boeing fighter, although the selection must still be approved by top levels of SingaporeÂ’s government.<br><br>The US Defence Security Cooperation Agency last week notified Congress of the potential F-15T sale, allowing it 30 days to respond to the proposal. While the sale is not expected to be challenged, Singapore wants to make sure it receives the weapons package it seeks through foreign military sales channels before a commercial contract is awarded for the aircraft and engines.<br><br>The 22 August notification reveals that Singapore is seeking an extensive armaments package, including 200 AIM-120 Amraam and 200 AIM-9X Sidewinder air-to air missiles, 50 GBU-38 Joint Direct Attack Munitions and 30 AGM-154A Joint Stand-off Weapons, both armed with BLU-111 warheads, and 30 unitary warhead-equipped AGM-154Cs. Singapore has also requested 24 Link 16 multifunctional information distribution system low-volume terminals and 44 AVS-9(V) night vision goggles.<br><br>The F-15 variant offered to Singapore is similar to the 40 F-15Ks due for delivery to South Korea from October, but will feature RaytheonÂ’s APG-63(V)3 active electronically scanned array radar. Singapore plans to order eight to 12 aircraft, plus eight to 12 options, but could acquire more if Lockheed MartinÂ’s F-35 Joint Strike Fighter is further delayed.<br><br>DassaultÂ’s Rafale is seen as the outsider, as Singapore would be the launch customer for the typeÂ’s export version, which requires the addition of new equipment. The competition has already been delayed by more than one year and another delay beyond September would require new bids from the manufacturers.</blockquote></div>
