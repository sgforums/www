In the late 1980s they were upgraded to the SM1 standard and only now are we beginning to phase them out after over 40 years in the SAF. We have close to some 300 SM1s. We are replacing the first batch of the SM1s with the refurbished Leopard 2A4. We recently bought 66, with 30 spare tanks, from German Army stocks. We will replace the remainder in the coming years.

To illustrate how we are working towards achieving Information Superiority, we want to recount our current experience in exploring the need and requirements for a High Altitude Long Endurance Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (HALE UAV). It has been a journey along the Â“Model-Test-ModelÂ” road.<br><br>In our view, a HALE UAV appears to be a feasible and attractive option for the tedious AEW mission and surveillance mission over Singapore . We have coined the name LALEE (Low Altitude Long Enduring Endurance) for this platform idea. LALEE is potentially an integrated airborne surveillance and communications system designed to provide continuous temporal cover-age over a very large area. </blockquote>3.<strong><a href="http://www.dsta.gov.sg/home/DisplayPage/ContentPage10.asp?id=829" rel="nofollow"></a></strong><blockquote><strong><a href="http://www.dsta.gov.sg/home/DisplayPage/ContentPage10.asp?id=829" rel="nofollow">One option is a system like the LALEE, studied for three years by a team under Lui. This unmanned air vehicle</a></strong> is described by Lui as "an integrated airborne surveillance and communications system to provide continuous temporal and very large spatial coverage". This would "provide a task group operating in the littorals with continuous surveillance from the air [at a cost] considerably cheaper than operating current-generation surveillance and communications platforms". </blockquote>4.<strong><a href="http://www.ainonline.com/publications/asian/asian_04/d3_dronep3.html" rel="nofollow">Singapore/EADS may do spy drone,by Chris Pocock</a></strong><br><br>5.I cant find a speech by Prof LUI Pao Chuen delivered<br>on a Naval forum about LALEE.<br><br>6.<strong></strong><blockquote><strong><a href="http://www.mindef.gov.sg/dtech/dtp/Past_DTP/2001/biodata.htm" rel="nofollow"> Over the last three years, DSO has been looking into the concept of an air vehicle </a></strong>that provides continuous and large spatial surveillance coverage. The project was named LALEE, which means Low Altitude Long Enduring Endurance.<br><br>In the presentation by Dr Tan, he will highlight the conceptualisation of LALEE, and the key technological challenges faced in its design and development. </blockquote></div>

The navy has opted for second hand A12 type submarines for training purposes and in fact all of the major surface ships procured such as the Formidable class FFGs and Endurance class LSDs are new built.

            <div class='col-md body'>Well, we `ll certainly buy more Leopard 2s. That was what Teo Chee Hean says in the budget speech. My guess is that we`ll probably get around  &gt;200. why is this? We  already have a supposed holding of  &gt;120 Tempests MBTs for a period of time before Malaysia purchased the Twardies or any MBTs. This number seems about right. And in the case that Malaysia buys more Twardies, we can certainly expect more Leopards. It is also a certain thing that they will be upgraded to at least the A5/A6 standard as is the case with all 2nd-hand goods. If so, they will be the most powerful MBTs in SEA.<br><br>The other thing to note is that I hardly think the Leos are meant to replace the AMX-13s. We still have the new light tank project for that. i just love how MINDEF twists everything up. For all you know, they could even say the Tempests(they never denied the existence of these machines remember) will also replaced by the Leos and in the end we`ll probably have about 300 Leos just like the AMX-13s. Meanwhile, Mindef could call the light tank a multi-role armoured vehicle which is nevertheless armed with a 105mm/120mm gun like the US`s FCS. So ultimatelty, we`ll literally end up with a highly capable and numerically superior tank force.<br><br>With Mindef you`ll never really know and im really proud of them.<br><br></div>
