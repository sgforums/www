            <div class='col-md body'>We are digressing. Anyway, back to the topic. What is exactly the rationale for buying the Vas-gotlands? No doubt, they are more capable than the Scorpenes and purchased at a good price.Will we absorb the the rest from the Swedes as well in the near futute? My thinking is that RSN is probably waiting to buy/build a newer generation of subs once it becomes available; maybe via cooperation with the Swedes. It is no point buying a submarine like the Scorpene or any other submarine of the same generation when come next decade, they are rendered obsolete.  Especially since you do intend to operate the subs for a long time.<br><br>Edit: by which time, RSN would already have evolved competent operating procedures and combat techniques in the waters in SEA.</div>

I was at Seletar East as a NSF and am still going there as a NSman.  Each time I take the bus into camp &amp; drop off outside the medical centre, I see lots of houses along the way.  So don't tell me the houses are at West camp.<br><br>If MLRS launch is targetted at say HQ ARMCEG or 35 SCE, are you 101% sure no stray missile is going to end up along Piccadilly, Old Birdcage Walk or Mornington Crescent?

            <div class='col-md body'>Gattling/Miniguns for spookys wont be overkill. Considering the idea behind the spooky is to lay down massive amounts of firepower to keep the enemies heads down. GPMG will just overheat with its one barrel within a minute of continuous firing. Thats the reason for a minigun/gattling gun. Multiple barrels for sustained and prolonged firing. Also, at that altitude the cycling rate of the gattling will prove to be useful to the gunner for predicting the trajectory of the bullets. I think it will be nice to put an AGL while we are at it for our Herc.<br><br>If we ever do it that is.<br><br>*oops din see carefully that u already added the AGL in ur shopping list.* haha</div>
