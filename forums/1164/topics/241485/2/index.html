That was what Teo Chee Hean says in the budget speech. My guess is that we`ll probably get around  &gt;200. why is this? We  already have a supposed holding of  &gt;120 Tempests MBTs for a period of time before Malaysia purchased the Twardies or any MBTs. This number seems about right. And in the case that Malaysia buys more Twardies, we can certainly expect more Leopards. It is also a certain thing that they will be upgraded to at least the A5/A6 standard as is the case with all 2nd-hand goods. If so, they will be the most powerful MBTs in SEA.<br><br>The other thing to note is that I hardly think the Leos are meant to replace the AMX-13s. We still have the new light tank project for that. i just love how MINDEF twists everything up. For all you know, they could even say the Tempests(they never denied the existence of these machines remember) will also replaced by the Leos and in the end we`ll probably have about 300 Leos just like the AMX-13s. Meanwhile, Mindef could call the light tank a multi-role armoured vehicle which is nevertheless armed with a 105mm/120mm gun like the US`s FCS. So ultimatelty, we`ll literally end up with a highly capable and numerically superior tank force.<br><br>With Mindef you`ll never really know and im really proud of them.<br><br></div></blockquote>This kind of solution is excellent.<br><br>Very good.<br><br>Not good for the people who like to try to frighten us with flimsy threats.</div>

Anyway while theirs is a grey area(both defense&amp;offense) of definition, what i meant was MLRS is purely offense in the weapons world..it's not and never considered a defense weapon that's all i mean.  Procuring it just shows that Malaysia has offensive intentions lar!<br><br>And when i say environmentally friendly, i mean it when we train, fire live round for training and Maintainence. Those solid fuel boosters are very hard to maintain and dirty to clean up...hence what i mean by environmentally unfriendly. Use in fighting okay..but day to day ...it's another story.<br><br>On other thing else, i believe we wont procure 300 Leos, it's a good tank, but it's not our tank.  We will buy more but wont replace 1 for 1 Sm1.  simply because leo takes 4 crew and SM1 3. A full leopard force will stretch our css elements but quite a bit afaik.  Not to mention 3 Mbt we can get 4 LT...Mindef will always go for the LT for less manpower/more firepower balance. We will procure a bit more Leopards to firm up a full strength unit(+) level and leave it as that. The rest of the Sm1s will most likely be replaced with a locally produced LT.  I bet the leopard purchase is also for other reasons related to our LT if my guesses are correct. (Germany dont have that many left to sell anyway since they might consider mothballing some for war reserves. the Leopard is a damn good tank after all!)<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>We don't need MLRS. If you study closer it is more of a psychological weapon against Singapore more than a effective offensive tool. It is effective against Singapore because we are small den population easy to inflict mass casulty.<br><br>For us to have MLRS we would have a broader spectrum of targets and area to fire to. If you look at Herzbollah the damage on israeli are more psychological than tactical gain.<br><br>So if for some reason they press the button n decide to launch MLRS it is to invade Singapore. won't be surprise if some rocket landed in JB. Singapore Arty and RASAF will take care of those targets.<br><br>I think to balance the strike capability is to acquire Surface to Surface launch  capability.

I asked because your terminology of our stuff is ...kinda odd...  I'm talking about the post above the one i'm quoting like "Singapore Arty and RASAF" but that's just me.<br><br>Anyway, with regards to use of MLRS, no one in the right frame of mind would use that against civilians.<br><br>MLRS is an area suppression weapon. It is to denial the enemy of quick advance as well as disrupting and even destroying any remotely large gathering of enemy forces. Very good prepping for an assault by mechanised forces by "softening" defensive sites and blanketing laager areas.<br><br>Other strategies of their use include counter-battery fire from safety due to their usually longer range rockets vs artillery rounds. (15-80 km vs 10-30km) as well as a strategic targeting to wipe out enemy HQ that hide deep behind the front.<br><br>It is an extremely useful tool to have hanging on your belt.<br><br>And NO. It would be a break in Singapore Defense Policy should we ever acquire surface-surface launch capabilities like that of cruise missiles. It's threatening and puts the entire region into instability.  How would your neighbour feel if you own a sniper rifle that can anytime hit him in the head?  Bad idea.  MLRS is not under this category.</div>

It takes time. When the call to arms is issued in malaysia(faced against an opponent like singapore as it is), Singapore and even other countries would be aware of it.  By which time, the Astross would be long gone. Any decent military would keep stock of the movements of such equipment.  You can`t hide military movements of that scale and it is equally hard to hide intentions for a conflict of that scale.<br><br>However, this is where the situation is different for Singapore and it confers a lot of benefit via Singapore`s smaller land mass and military doctrine. We can mobilize resources and assets so fast that it is nearly impossible for them to respond adequately. And we`ve been doing it so frequently, it is a hard take to tell if we`re really serious.<br><br>The Astross is more or less an effort to balance out thier relative lack of artillery pieces as compared to Singapore. But it`s inefficient. They`ll probably use it to shoot and scoot away on thier own territory while RSAF birds and other intelligence/surveillance assets are flying over-head. The poor drivers and men.<br><br>Im not sure if we will get any form of MLRs though; especially if our long range shots are delivered better, cheaper and with more precision via our planes and overwhelming artillery. At current force levels as compared to the Malaysians, we will be too over-powering to procure any MLRS now.<br><br>We will probably be getting some new long range cruise missiles to go with the F-15SGs like South Korea; Slam-ers or JASSMs. Im sure the Malaysians and Indons are looking at Brahmos though it will take them ages to decide on anything.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Such rockets will not be able to make buildings like skycrapers collapse.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"> Neither can conventional ballistic missiles which are much much bigger. The war-heads are too small. It is the fuselage containing the fuel which makes them bigger. Can you collapse a building by firing an artillery shell/s at it? Answer: No. That is why it is called a pyschological weapon. The sooner people realise this, the better it is.<br><br>Like I said before, they can`t simply shoot and not prepare for a war prior to that. Simple logic. They can`t prepare for a war without making everyone aware in the world about it.  The SAF would already be moving inland into Malaysia by then.<br><br>They need it to balance thier relative lack of fire-power artillery-wise. That`s why they bought it.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>You can certainly bring down a large building using explosive demolition charges placed at the key places.  Random artillery and rocket shells won`t; let alone tough and reinforced military structures. Of course, you can try firing  hundreds of shells at a single large building to see if it topples. But what is the scenario here again ? Earthquakes stand a better chance at bringing down these large structures. And only major ones..</div>
