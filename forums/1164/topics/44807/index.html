Was reading one of the threads where u guys were talking about our old AMX13s. There are stories floating around that the SAF wants new light tanks, as u all know. Thought it might be fun if u guys have any ideas about what gizmos u want this 'rumoured' light tank to have? Time to get creative....</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hey Joe, I would like to comment a little on your list. I pretty much agree with almost all your points, but points 2, 3 and 5 are a little too extravagant.<br><br>"2. active defensive suites including a laser warner, IR warner, IR jammer, laser disruptor "<br><br>I do believe that a laser warner, wire-quided missile jammer ( to defeat TOW type threats) and a combination of multi-spectral smoke screen from smoke grenades would give sufficient protection. If one wants more, maybe an IR suppressive paint coating would be good to reduce the detection range of any enemy tank equipped with a thermal detector. As for equipping our tank with a laser-disruptor, why? Our tanks are not facing any threat from laser guided missiles in the near term. Besides, even if there were such a threat, the above mentioned system of laser-warning and smoke screen protection should provide enuff protection to the tank.<br><br>"3. Some form of digitised battlefield management system including an IFF system. "<br><br>A digitised battlefield management system would also be, IMHO, extravagant. Such a system, if fielded, would need to be robust to prevent enemy jamming or worse, enemy hacking. Also, we do not have a huge ISR backbone comprising d ARLs, J-STARS, U-2S etc ala US. Thus, the benefits accrued from a digitised force would not be as great, considering the expense required to equip our tanks. I feel that a IFF system would suffice.<br><br>"5. chassis mounted close circuit camera for driver (liken to that used in Mekarva 4 and Leo2A6). "<br><br>This is also, IMHO, an extravagance, unless this tank is going to spend a lot of time in the urban environment.<br><br>"2. commander .50 cal MG for infantry/soft skinned vehicles "<br><br>I would prefer the 40mm AGL with HEDP and air-burst munitions instead. This would give much higher killing power. Maybe the .50 for the commander, and the 40mm co-axially mounted? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"><br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I dun think chassis mounted closed circuit camera for driver is too extravagant.  the tank prob is gonna spend a large part of its time in urban environments.<br><br>And yes, the idea of fitting an AGL coaxial to a .50 MG is pretty good, and much more economical then an advanced grenade launcher system around the turret, those prob should remian as smoke grenade launcher only.  also, they are mostly pointed at a certain degree upwards.<br><br>For most grenades launched from launchers instead of hand, there are usually pointing at the target or just above the target, the usual position of the smoke grenade launchers at the side are at a very wierd angle to have HE grenades popping out from...</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Well, i guess how many rounds u can squeeze in depends on the calibre of the gun. I mean, if u are gonna slap a 120mm CTG on to it, i guess u could probably squeeze in about 20-25 rounds realistically.... Logically, a smaller gun means u can carry more rounds, rite? I am also worried about weight. I understand that an autoloader is necessary due to manpower restrictions, but that usually means a larger turrent and more weight and less space. Hopefully they can find a way for a small and light autoloading system. Do u guys think a 120mm gun is really necessary?</div>

            </div>
            <div class='col-md body'>Points not yet mentioned:<br><br>1. The light tank MUST be able to fire on the move. If not, you had might as well build it as an assault gun rather than a tank (gun directly mounted in the body rather than on a turret). I doubt we can get a 120mm gun to fire on the move with a Bionix sized vehicle, since the larger CV90120 cannot. This means we are probably limited to 105mm, which is enough to kill the upcoming Malaysian PT-91s anyway.<br><br>If it were me, our tank forces would have two vehicles. One would be a conventional 105mm light tank and the other would be a more heavily armored 120mm (maybe 155mm) assault gun, which doubles as an SP mortar. Both would be Bionix sized. Go to <a href="http://www.angelfire.com/art/enchanter/agm.html" rel="nofollow">Phil West's page</a> to see what I mean.<br><br>2. The light tank must have sufficient anti-personnel and defensive weaponry. Since our potential opponents will not be tank-heavy forces (even after the Malaysians obtain their MBTs) and the terrain in the region is not conducive for tank on tank warfare, we should not go the way of the M1 Abrams and optimize the tank too heavily for the anti-tank mission.<br><br>The new tank must be able to fire APERS canister / flechette / beehive rounds through its main gun. It should have at least 3 weapons in addition to the main gun: a coaxial 12.7mm machinegun, and turret mounted 7.62mm machinegun and 40mm AGL. Preferably, it should have a bow mounted gun for the driver, and miniguns or 30mm ASP cannons instead of machineguns. The possibility of mounting a flamethrower should be available. If possible, the tank should have command detonated ERA, which would serve as defensive claymore mines.<br><br>3. The light tank must have enough armor protection. It must be able to withstand all existing LAWs to the front and flanks, since they will be the main threat to the tank. This will require spaced armor, ERA, and/or the <a href="http://www.washtimes.com/world/20020820-86081662.htm" rel="nofollow">new British electrified armor system</a> to defeat the HEAT warheads. It is impossible to provide that much kinetic protection within the weight constraints, so we will need to settle for kinetic protection up to about 35mm using HHS and ceramics. Protection against top attack munitions like ATGMs can be provided by spaced armor on the top. Antitank mine protection is possible with a V-shaped double hull on the underside. Shields for the crew when firing the anti-personnel weaponry should also be provided.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by dkhoo:</div><div class="quote_body">Points not yet mentioned:<br><br>1. The light tank MUST be able to fire on the move. If not, you had might as well build it as an assault gun rather than a tank (gun directly mounted in the body rather than on a turret). I doubt we can get a 120mm gun to fire on the move with a Bionix sized vehicle, since the larger CV90120 cannot. This means we are probably limited to 105mm, which is enough to kill the upcoming Malaysian PT-91s anyway.<br><br>If it were me, our tank forces would have two vehicles. One would be a conventional 105mm light tank and the other would be a more heavily armored 120mm (maybe 155mm) assault gun, which doubles as an SP mortar. Both would be Bionix sized. Go to <a href="http://www.angelfire.com/art/enchanter/agm.html" rel="nofollow">Phil West's page</a> to see what I mean.<br><br>2. The light tank must have sufficient anti-personnel and defensive weaponry. Since our potential opponents will not be tank-heavy forces (even after the Malaysians obtain their MBTs) and the terrain in the region is not conducive for tank on tank warfare, we should not go the way of the M1 Abrams and optimize the tank too heavily for the anti-tank mission.<br><br>The new tank must be able to fire APERS canister / flechette / beehive rounds through its main gun. It should have at least 3 weapons in addition to the main gun: a coaxial 12.7mm machinegun, and turret mounted 7.62mm machinegun and 40mm AGL. Preferably, it should have a bow mounted gun for the driver, and miniguns or 30mm ASP cannons instead of machineguns. The possibility of mounting a flamethrower should be available. If possible, the tank should have command detonated ERA, which would serve as defensive claymore mines.<br><br>3. The light tank must have enough armor protection. It must be able to withstand all existing LAWs to the front and flanks, since they will be the main threat to the tank. This will require spaced armor, ERA, and/or the <a href="http://www.washtimes.com/world/20020820-86081662.htm" rel="nofollow">new British electrified armor system</a> to defeat the HEAT warheads. It is impossible to provide that much kinetic protection within the weight constraints, so we will need to settle for kinetic protection up to about 35mm using HHS and ceramics.

Shields for the crew when firing the anti-personnel weaponry should also be provided.</div></blockquote>wow too much things on a light tank leh.<br><br>and for the guy who said yeap....<br><blockquote>for me.. slap on a twin TOW cellbox thingie beside the 120 like the one on the Bradley....</blockquote>The Americans and Germans tried it but decided it would make the tank to heavy,to compliacating to build and handle and hard to mantain.In the end the scapped the project</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>The Merk has had 60mm mortar for all 4 models. If you go with a 3 man crew,there will be no point in having this. Its interesting your expression "load out".

If you put a 105mm L7 in a Bionix chassis, expect to get 35 to 40 rounds main rounds in a belly load.

The M8 AGS is a prime example of what miniture technology has achieved over the years. In fact, what we have discussed so far  (in terms of our wish list of things to have in the new light tank) is already available in the M8 AGS. You can also almost find most of these features in some of the AFV cum light tanks from the Spanish ASCORDs to the British Warrior light tank. Not to mention, the Swedish CV90-120T incorporated the almost exact specs (except for the lack of an autoloader) that we have wished for in the new light tank.<br><br>We have discussed, in numerous threads that MBTs are not suitable as a direct replace for the SM1s. We never dismissed MBT roles in SAF ORBAT. They should only replace the Centurions (Tempest or whatever name it was given). We also mentioned the need for the 32Div formation to be a truely heavy armour/mechanised Division.</div>
