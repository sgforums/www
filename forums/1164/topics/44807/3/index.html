            <div class='col-md body'>On The Way, heavy tanks pushing north will be restricted to a few well defined axes by the terrain. These axes (NS highway, major trunk roads) will become a killing field of airstrike corridors, minefields, tank traps, dragon's teeth, dug-in ambush positions and artillery fire. The roads are nothing but traps, since there are few enough of them to defend in detail. I do not care how much armor your tanks have. If the enemy knows what you are going to do, they will kill you.<br><br>That is why advancing through the jungle is necessary, something that heavy tanks will find extremely difficult. That is why we are investing so much in tracked logistics vehicles like the ATTC. The ultimate protection in war is deception and evasion, not Chobham. Hey-diddle-diddle-straight-up-the-middle attacks are only worthwhile if you have American-style overwhelming superiority. Again, we are not the Americans.<br><br>As far as heavy armor in FIBUA is concerned, I have my doubts. It is not armor that protects tanks in urban terrain, but accompanying infantry. If there is no infantry support, your tanks will be destroyed regardless of the thickness of their armor, by mines, top or rear attacks and close assaults. If the infantry are doing their job, your armor will not even be tested by enemy fire. Heavy armor gives a greater degree of tactical flexibility and "forgiveness", but it cannot replace combined arms cooperation.<br><br>Regarding ATGMs, I find it strange that tankers only talk about the front armor of the M1 series. Is the enemy restricted to shooting you in the front? Maybe in the desert where you can see where the enemy is and point your front at him. But in the jungle or cities where you do not know where the enemy is, I wonder how you are going to keep your front to the enemy. But again, I am an ignorant infantryman. It is just that when I walk around in the jungle, I do not seriously expect to only be shot from the front in a war. Why do tankers count on it so much?<br><br>On The Way, you have a very armor-centric view of operations to me. I probably have a very infantry-centric view of operations to you. The best strategy is probably combined arms, with our CE, Arty and other brethren as well. Whatever tank SAF eventually chooses, let's hope they bear that in mind.<br></div>

Why do tankers count on it so much?</div></blockquote>Basically because tankers are taught to use their heaviest armor at all times in all situtations. If you studied armour movement and formations, they are actually forumlated to allow an armoured unit to move presenting their heaviest armour to cover each other at all times. In a sense, while the tanks do nto have armour in all areas, they advance in such a way they cover each other's back, making it difficult for anybody to get in a shot in a weak area. How did you think the Israelis and Americans can advance their tanks into urban areas and still emerge generally unscathed? Your unit formation and covering each others back is extremely important in armour, no lone rangers here. You frontal armour is extremely important, it is prehaps the most important form of protection you can employ against your enemy.<br><br>On the other hand, I'm not sure what tatics the Arabs and Ruskies use, but it seems to be just chionging in peacemeal and being big and bad with swarms of tanks, and hence their losses are higher out of proportion to the actual quality of their equipment. A combination fo bad tatics and equipment litters the battlefield with wrecked soviet-bloc tanks.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>zigzag,<br><br>The armor triad is typically phrased as Mobility, Protection and Firepower. Mobility encompasses weight, range and speed, among other things. Protection takes physical size and stealth into account. Firepower includes belly load and weapon selection. A balance is needed between all three factors.<br><br>However, while the armor triad is often quoted by tankers, it only covers the technical design of an armored vehicle. There are other equally important factors that are typically the purview of staff officers. These are Cost and Sustainability. Cost does not only refer to purchase cost, but also manning requirements, life cycle costs, maintenance costs and upgradability. Sustainability includes factors like maintainability, reliability and logistical burden.<br><br>There is also a catch-all category sometimes referred to as Human Factors, which includes things like comfort, psychological impact, user-friendliness and training requirement. I find that these tend to step beyond the actual vehicle design to unrelated things, though.<br><br>Of course, there is a lot of overlap between these six main criteria. For example, range and ammo load are also Sustainability problems since they affect the logistical requirements of the vehicle. But this is the normal schema I find used to discuss armored vehicle design.<br><br>I would not place any factor above the others. There needs to be a balance. That is the whole idea. You must have some of all of them.<br><br>That said, I feel that too little emphasis is given to Cost. We must have equipment and doctrines that are suitable for our unique situation. The optimum strategy when you are poor is not simply a scaled down version of the strategy when you are rich. We are not a very large armed force or economy and we need to have some restraint when making equipment purchases (not just armored vehicle purchases, but aircraft, etc.) I am sure that is already being done, but I am still worried. Some recent acquisitions have seemed rather costly to me.</div>

Most of the French army tanks, despite some being impressive like the Char 1C were wasted piecemeal or surrendered without firing a shot, more of a reflection on tatics, rather then the actual quality of equipment.

Early German sucesses were more due to their armoured tatics, as I have said, not the actual quality of their Panzers, which were at a time even outclassed by the humble M4 Sherman.<br><br>Besides it was Soviet armoured juggernault that finally won the day in WW2 in europe, and in a big way as well. Soviet armour finally reigned supreme over German armour. I'm afraid I must reject your stating of WW2 out of hand, entirely.</div></blockquote>Did i say toe to toe??I said they brought victory to the Germans.Yes they used better tactics,logistics and overall skill at personal level.But is bringing victory to the side that used them is the point is it not?<br>Ths Soviet juggernault won as a result of help from it's allies and the mistakes/stupidity of Hitler.That Russia could have won on her own is most certainly debatable.As for the Sherman out classing their actual Panzer i'm assuming you're talking about the Pz IV Ausf G/H??Well sorry dude but those tanks were more then a match for the Shermans.The Pz 4Ausf A-D's though i must say was very much outclass by practially everything cept maybe the polish tanks?heck i think even the Soma's were better!!Anyway the thing here is i do not agree with your saying that we should have something that does the job what i am disagreeing with you is how through history a small gun+thin armour=lousy tank.You should know that 1 more reason the Germans had so much success was due to the 3man turrent instead of the 2 men turrent that the Russians and French/Brits had.But that you should know that already. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"></div>
