            <div class='col-md body'>Hi Joe Black,<br>I have to difer from your opinion on this. By the way, you forgot to add Cadillag Stngray II to the list.<br>M8 AGS- U have to buy it with the heaviest level 3 modular armour package, and even than it will barely stop a single warhead handheld RPG. This is due to its original layer of armour which is only an alumninum alloy. An ATGW will waste this light weight. Compare what a modern heavy MBT can offer. At least 300mm RHA at the most vulnerable points plus ERA to defeat even tandem warhead ATGW. Not to mention if you go with a western heavy MBT, u can get chobham armour, or maybe even a DU layer on top pf that, plus ERA if u wish too. Also, even a M1 early model was shown to have withstand a T-72 APFDSD round with no interior penetration. As the Malaysian PT-91 uses the same 125mm gun, can you convincingly claim that a M8 with the level 3 armour will also be able to withstand a 125mm APFSDS round? I think not. I like the auto loader on the M8, but I hate the 30 main round capacity. Most MBTs can carry at least 50 or more for 105mm ammo. In combat, 30 main rounds may not last you thru 3 engagements.<br>ASCOD- sames weaknesses as the M8 except worse. No turret stabilization, only 40 rounds of main ammo, and base model does not come with any ability to withstand any more than small arms and shell splinters. Need serious armour upgrade<br>CV90- again lack of ability to take punishment, and 40 round capacity.  Plus i have to question the price of all these light tank purchases. As you know, there are no available used light tanks such as the above on the world market. Hence, the SAF will have to buy new. I would venture to say that a new CV90 or M8 will probably cost more than a used Leo 1, M1, and most certainly a T-72. There is a fire sale on M60s somewhere in the world, and the IDF will still sell you really nice Magach 7s or SABRAS for a good price.<br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by Joe Black:</div><div class="quote_body">&lt;</div></blockquote>&lt;&lt;<br><br>I think 4 SAB is being assigned to 32 Div. Although I would not dispute the need for a SM1 type of tank, the mix is all wrong in the SAF. u have 350 AMX-13s and about 80 Tempest. It should be the other way around.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hi Bcoy,<br>Yes, I did find out about the Mexas armour plating. Frankly, I think his calculations a little bit sala. I look at the graph, but I don't see it. What he is saying is that a 20mm think Mexas layer has the same resistance as 250mm RHA!! Wah lau, in that case, you can use the Bionix IFV as a heavy APC! This Mexas is not miracle armour. If it is, than every tankmaker in the world will add 60mm of Mexas armour on top of 10 mm of aluminum armour and have a RHA of 750mm, enough to defeat the strongest 120mm DU rounds. Well, he lives in Vancouver. BC I believe. Maybe I meet him for coffee the next time I am there. He is angmoh and lives in canada, so I don't think he will be a ISD spy. U are right, I enjoy the fact there are Israeli tankees, US and British tankees and even Russian tankess on that tanknet forum.

            <div class='col-md body'>A 120mm gun is an overkill in SE Asia. Your heaviest armor opposition is Leo 1s in Thai army, plus Pt-91 in Mat army. APFSDS 105mm should be enough to penetrate both these MBTs even over the frontal arc. To be on the safe side, SAS can order APFSDS DU rounds. For sure will kill them. Also, the 105mm will permit at least the carriage of 50 main tank rounds versus low 30s for 120mm. For live firing training, it will be cheaper.<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by zigzag:</div><div class="quote_body">Well, i guess how many rounds u can squeeze in depends on the calibre of the gun. I mean, if u are gonna slap a 120mm CTG on to it, i guess u could probably squeeze in about 20-25 rounds realistically.... Logically, a smaller gun means u can carry more rounds, rite? I am also worried about weight. I understand that an autoloader is necessary due to manpower restrictions, but that usually means a larger turrent and more weight and less space. Hopefully they can find a way for a small and light autoloading system. Do u guys think a 120mm gun is really necessary? </div></blockquote></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>On The Way, the problem is that the heavy tanks you want are not going to be very mobile or easy to support. Not many bridges and roads in the region can support their weight, meaning that the combat engineers will have their hands full just keeping them moving. They also need a lot of logistical support. We have enough to support hundreds of light tanks, but not hundreds of MBTs. Unless we really beef up the logistics, the MBTs will have no fuel and no ammo.<br><br>About MEXAS armor: Armor has different resistances toward different weapons. Not just kinetic (AP, APFSDS) vs. chemical (HEAT, HESH), but each individual weapon. It is possible for a piece of armor to have 250mm RHA against tungsten sabot penetrators, but only 20mm RHA against carbide-tipped sabot penetrators of the same calibre. MEXAS is a ceramic armor, which works by being so hard that the penetrator shatters like glass when it hits. But that only works if the ceramic is hard enough. If the penetrator is harder than the ceramic, the armor shatters and offers very little protection. So read claims about armor protection with many grains of salt.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>On The Way, while I understand your desire as a tanker to have a more heavily armored vehicle, you must also understand that the SAF does not have the near unlimited financial, manpower and logistical resources of the US Army. If it came down to a choice, we could have hundreds of light tanks or dozens of MBTs. While you would of course prefer to be sitting in a safer and more powerful MBT, it is better for the Army as a whole if you accept a lower level of armor protection so that there can be more tanks. I feel that the current force structure of 350 light tanks and &lt;100 MBTs is about right.<br><br>How much is enough armor? While your opinion as a tanker is very valuable, hear this ignorant infantryman. Our potential adversaries have few tanks (even after Malaysia gets its MBTs), so protection against tank main gun rounds is less important, especially since it is very expensive weight-wise. We can also forget about ATGM protection, since even massive M1A2s are penetrated by modern ATGMs (ground or air-launched). I believe that the main threats will come from anti-tank weapons carried by infantry and light armored vehicles.<br><br>As such, we should aim for at least frontal protection against 84mm HEAT (400mm RHA) and 90mm APDS (170mm RHA), with all round protection against RPG-9 (300mm RHA) and 35mm APDS (100mm RHA). Top armor must be proof against 155mm airburst. The next step up would be to 106mm HEAT frontal protection and 84mm HEAT all-round protection, using add-on ERA. This would make the tanks tough to crack for anything except tank main gun rounds and ground or air-launched ATGMs, which is already better than plain vanilla Centurion Mk 2. I think this can be achieved with spaced armor and ERAto boost the chemical energy protection of a Bionix, along with some applique HHS or ceramic armor. A more powerful engine to carry the extra weight of the armor and turret, and it should be OK.<br><br>All my opinion of course.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Dear T-rex,<br>U are not looking at the total picture. U are looking at just the performance of 120mm vs 105mm. Of course, the 120mm is a better gun. no doubt. I examine other factors such as:<br>a) Engagement distances- Given our type of terrain, with no open desert, what is the typical engagement distance in a tank vs tank here in SE Asia. Certainly not 4000m or more. More likely to be 1000m to 2500m max. The 120mm is clearly superior in performance to the 105mm at ranges of 3500m and above. At shorter range, there is no distinct advantage. At 1500m, all the modular armour in the world will not save u from a 105mm DU round.<br>b) Belly load - 120mm ammo is larger, and soem come with separate charge, etc. In a MBT, you typicaly give up 30% more carrying capacity if you go with a 120mm. In a 105mm M1 for example, you can carry 55 rounds. When you go to 120mm M1A2, the belly load drops to 40 only. Can u be so confident in the fog of war and knowing the standard of our MT drivers that your ammo train will find you in time to replenish you? The xtra 15 rounds could mean success or failure. Its at least 2 engagements more. In addition, SAF philosophy is that tank will take a support role for infantry. Trust me, the infantry will appreciate the extra rounds.<br>c) Who is your enemy? - The Malaysian armour is mainly Sibmas, Scorpion, Condors, KIFVs, etc. 105mm HE is more than enough to kill them. PT-91 comprise only a small percentage. U want the whole SAF tank fleet to go to 120mm just for this?<br>d) Advances in 105mm ammo- Although the L7 is a the end of its life cycle, the ammo makers are constantly comming up with improved 105mm rounds. The IMI 105mm DU round is supposed to be one bad mother, with penetrator rod going thru T-72 at 5000m.<br>I can go on, but these are just the main points.<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by SingaporeTyrannosaur:</div><div class="quote_body">Nonsense, it never hurts to get an increase in preformance, esp when the increase will help save your butt. 120mm can penetrate and kill the Malaysians further off then a 105mm can, where a glancing, or break up shot in a 105 will be fatal with a 120mm.<br><br>Somemore if the Malaysians decide to include modular armor packages, your 105's preformance will be limited even more.

Not many bridges and roads in the region can support their weight, meaning that the combat engineers will have their hands full just keeping them moving. They also need a lot of logistical support. We have enough to support hundreds of light tanks, but not hundreds of MBTs. Unless we really beef up the logistics, the MBTs will have no fuel and no ammo.<br>My understanding of Mexas armour is a little different. It is not just ceramics, but is actaully a sandwich. The last layer is usually a heavy duty ballistic spall liner, with the 1st layer being ceramics. The Mexas armor craters absorbing the shot, and than it hopes to shatters the penetrator rod. Its expensive, but I am not sure how good it really is.<br><br>About MEXAS armor: Armor has different resistances toward different weapons. Not just kinetic (AP, APFSDS) vs. chemical (HEAT, HESH), but each individual weapon. It is possible for a piece of armor to have 250mm RHA against tungsten sabot penetrators, but only 20mm RHA against carbide-tipped sabot penetrators of the same calibre. MEXAS is a ceramic armor, which works by being so hard that the penetrator shatters like glass when it hits. But that only works if the ceramic is hard enough. If the penetrator is harder than the ceramic, the armor shatters and offers very little protection. So read claims about armor protection with many grains of salt.</div></blockquote></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>In the first place, the likelihood there is an advance of several hundred klicks into the enemy capital is unlikely. Most likely, we establish holding line to secure water assets. But lets say we do go all the way  there, than I suggest u do not look at the Iraq war example. Its a totally different terrain. In order to attack our flanks, the enemy will himself have to move his arty, armour, infantry, etc. through jungle and plantations. Good luck to him. If he can move all of that more than 5 km a day without getting spotted in the air, than he must have the best army in the world. The enemy at the most can do small scale guereilla style ambush with hand held anti tank weapons, in which case your light tanks will get flamed much more easier than a heavy MBT, hence reducing your odds of fighting out of the ambush.<br><br>As for crushing superiority, of course we have crushing and overwhelming superiority at the point of attack. Our entire army and air force is located in the tactical battlefield. The enemy's units are spread north as far as Georgetown, and Langkawi. Furthermore, we choose the time and place of attack. If we attack in the middle of the night, during the peak of Ramadan  (when the enemy forces are fasting) or during Hari Raya Puasa, (when their soldiers are on leave), u are saying we will not achieve crushing superiority in the battle field? Maybe you want to be fair to them, and wait for the enemy to move all their units down from the north, and concentrate every single plane and man in the state of Johore and ask them to be on high alert, before you attack? Is that right?<br><br>My dear Viper, if the enemy has been able to stockpile arms and equipment in the jungle, than we would have already lost the war. Secret stockpiles in the jungle that you mention are fragments of your imagination. They are a function of time and stealth. Given enough time, and if they are stealthy enough, they can do a Ho chi Minh type trail. If we don't resolve the conflict either militarily or diplomatically within a week, we are finished anyway.
