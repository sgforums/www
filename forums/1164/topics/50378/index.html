            <div class='col-md body'>I didn't bother to search the VCD, but I wonder if I did remember if they did show some screens of they waterfall display...<br><br>The "radar" display looks to me like an oversimplified Tatical Master Display... but do they have that in Sonar, Conn?<br><br>On the upside, I kinda like the way they carried most of the stuff in the movie, quite real to life, in most parts.<br><br>Though I wonder why in the heat of battle, when the Akula had already detected them, the XO/acting Captain called for the ADCAPs to be launched electrically instead of being blasted out the usual way with air pressure. You only fire your tubes electrically when you want the torpedos to swim out instead of making tons of noise being kicked out. Since the Akula had already detected them and there was a real racket of battle going on, calling for an electrical launch seems redundant to me, if not even wrong, for the ADCAPs would take longer to launch...<br><br>And when you go to the outside shot of the Alabama, you see that indeed, they have launched the ADCAPs electrically, without the telltale rising bubbles of a conventional launch.<br><br>On the other hand, the Akula pumped all all it's shots using the conventional method.</div>
