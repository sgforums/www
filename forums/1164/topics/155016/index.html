            <div class='col-md body'>ST today:<br><br>The Republic of Singapore Navy's (RSN) four Challenger-class submarines are the oldest boats in the navy. These subs were built for the Royal Swedish Navy in 1968.<br><br>Mindef said it may buy two Vastergotland-class submarines, built in the early 1980s, as possible replacements for some of the Challengers.<br><br>Swedish newspapers have said the deal could be worth one billion Swedish kronor (<strong><blockquote>S$220 million</blockquote></strong>). The Vastergotland subs, named after a county in Sweden, will be refurbished before they are sold.<br><br>'The Swedish Navy is planning to stand down two of its submarines of the Vastergotland class,' said a Defence Ministry spokesman. 'Mindef is now considering whether this might provide the RSN an opportunity to enhance its submarine capabilities by replacing some of its Challenger-class submarines with the Vastergotland-class submarines.'<br><br>Three of the Challengers have been commissioned into RSN service, leaving the fourth, RSS Challenger, yet to be declared ready for operations.<br><br>Mindef noted that it has had 'a long cooperative relationship with Sweden in the area of submarines'.<br><br>It said it purchased the Challenger-class submarines 'for training and experience in operating submarines'.<br><br>Defence analysts said the Vastergotlands would give the RSN's submarine force more punch, as the subs have been fitted with a new kind of engine called 'air independent propulsion'. This engine allows the sub to stay underwater longer.<br><br>Challenger subs, on the other hand, are powered by electric batteries while underwater to ensure the boats are silent and hard to detect.<br><br>But the batteries need recharging every few days using the diesel engines. The motors are noisy and, to use them, the submerged sub needs to raise a snorkel so the engines can operate.<br><br>I think the price with AIP is very cheap.<br><strong></strong></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>If Singapore does acquire the two A17 (Vastergotland) SSKs then it the next logical step would be 2 or 3 new-build SSKs based on the A19 (Gotland) class or perhaps the Viking class. My guess is that the French Scorpene and German Type 214 also under evaluation would have slimmer chances winning future orders from the RSN. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_idea.gif" alt="Idea" title="Idea"><br><br>IMO,logically upgrade the Challenger Class sub with AIP.Anyway if RSN decided that we should own more sub i thought its an excellent idea. Getting our submarine violating sea boundaries wont cause any political out-cry cos our neighbours might never realise that she is in their water.<br><br>Again IMO, Project Viking will be a failure. Since the Norwegians withdrawn while Danish decided in June 2003 to cease funding the project in its 2005-09 Defense Plan.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_surprised.gif" alt="Surprised" title="Surprised"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>However, I think that we are getting a much better deal than a lot of other naval force. For S$220mil, you get 2 sub with AIP. Despite that these 2 subs are already 20years old, it is still ahead of a lot of PLAN Ming sub and Song Sub in the region. Esp the swedish sub is famous for her stealth features, even able to penetrate the USN carrier group defences in exercises.<br><br>Of course, there will still be some critics who will say that we garlang kunei other's people 2nd hand junk. There would also be some people busy show casing their best most advance scopene subs after 2009 as well.<br><br>I personally agredd with our armed forces policy on focusing on best value for bucks. A lot of people tends to oversee there are critical compoents that made up a good weapon system. Eg our delta class frigate is a good buy; as we gain access into stealth tech, advance radar and fire control systems and combat mission systems. In addition, maintaining a strong defence needs $$ and tech. In the future, we will see more force multiplying technologies available to us through our active participation in R&amp;D. Advance robotic USV Unmanned Surface Vessel is a good example for this type of tech.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>About the retro fitting, do we have the capability to upgrade subs?  What would happen if we added an AIP extension to the challengers?

Local media reports in Sweden suggest that VÃ¤stergÃ¶tland and HÃ¤lsingland - to be retired early from the Royal Swedish Navy (RSwN) as a result of cutbacks in submarine force levels - will be transferred as part of a sales agreement valued at about SEK1 billion (USD128 million).<br><br><strong>The package is expected to include modernisation refits prior to delivery incorporating the addition of a Stirling air-independent propulsion (AIP) system.</strong><br><br>Sweden sold four Type A 14 submarines to Singapore in the mid-1990s under projects Riken I and Riken II.
