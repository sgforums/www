            <div class='col-md body'>Good article, thanks. Half a surprise to see the SU-30s do very well in long range engagements vs F-15s. What was more surprising was the statement that Indian Air Force pilots had more flight time than USAF pilots. Could we be on the verge of the decline of expertise in US pilots? Just a thought; it's happened before (early portion of Vietnam conflict being the best example), it could happen again.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Probably they need more funding since more countries are developing advanced IRST capabilities which could track down stealthy designed aircraft like the Raptor.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Well....with the increasing technologies applied by other countries, could there be a lack of funding by the US govt to do enough research to combat the growing interest in military technology by other countries?<br><br>I think it would require another Cold War scenario for increased fundings...<br><br>Remember tt it was during tt time tt many inventions were made possible...</div>

Maybe we should just buy the airframe from Russia, and put in western engine and aviontics ourselves. Think we 1st create a super new type of SU27 , also lots of orders will come for this cheap but cheaper option in aircrafts</div>
