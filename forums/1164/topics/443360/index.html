              <p>Haha are you AI? I guess as a door kicking grunt, you are deemed not good enough for the M-4.</p>
              <p>These guys have some non-standard equipment. Their combat rig and water bottle pouch are US BDU woodland, probably cause our standard issue ones are not molle. The guy's camo scarf is also not no4 and not Marpat, it's some cheapo cloth.</p>

              lol, sorry, don't do doors. I got airforce slaves to do that for me :P (Probably because door vs me, door wins. lol )
              
              The scarf is probably classed under personal items, you have to get it yourself, same as balaclavas and sniper veils, not sure about the rig though, they could have gotten it online? SF/(ADF?) guys have a certain amount of leeway in regards to their personal equipment.

              Yeah the M-4 was still ok, they were going for logistical commonality I guess, but that didn't stop us from asking our brigade commander 1st in-camp back after the change:"What can the SAR do that our M-4 with scope can't? LAD? We have to shoot, we're screwed anyway." 
              
              But I can see the easing of maintainance and parts logistics from the support side, and the SAR is passable as a weapon, easier sight picture, so it's 50/50 I guess, not to mention we can grab a gun or mag off a body in wartime and use it with some familiarity. Now if only we can teach those NSF not to oil the #$%&amp;%* optical sights. Our fam shoot, one of my platoonmates was BOBO(WOWO for you oldtimers)-ing and we were wondering what happened, none of us are THAT bad shots. Found out someone oiled the sights with a very thin film of oil, parallex got thrown off. (And Sepecat said it can't happen, yeah...right...)

              Singapore's M-4 has a 2 point stock extension, the pic you see above is the unextended mode, short and handy, to extend it, you press the back of the half-Y shape on the bottom of the stock and pull. The Y is actually a lever on a pivot, pressing the back pulls the locking pin out of the 1st lock hole, and once you pull it back and let go, it springs back into the 2nd lock hole at the back.
