The SAR-21 is strictly for right-hand use only.<br>- The Tavor uses an integrated reflex sight with red-dot + laser aiming device fixed on the barrel.  The SAR-21 uses a scope fixed to the barrel with a separate LAD slund underneath the barrel.<br>- The Tavor uses M-16 magazines.  The SAR-21 uses its proprietary plastic magazines (though ST Engg does have SAR-21 that uses M-16 mags for exports).<br><br>Southpark<br>The Dude</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>the story, or the one i heard, is that ST worked with the israelis for awhile on the design of the weapon, then decided to go seperate ways to develop it... that is why they look kinda similar, but are actually 2 different weapons.<br><br>the SAR bolt carrier, for those who had done NS before, will in fact look very, very familiar...<br><br>as for which weapon is better, lets just agree to disagree on that  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br><br>as for whether ST imports stuff... well, depends which ST u're referring to... STK mostly manufactures under license and exports stuff through Unicorn, their marketing arm... i heard also that this is the same pple who are known to have some rather unsavory clients but in the business world, money is money...<br><br>as for importing for mindef, i think not... mindef deals direct unless ST has a role in customising, modifying the system for them... then ST is operating under license from the original dealer... kinda like a partnership.<br><br>mindef has also made it very clear on some occassions that ST does not have a monopoly in supplying systems to the SAF... if they can't deliver the specs, mindef will shop elsewhere.<br></div>

Take the G36 / XM8 German rifle, and S. Africa's Vector CR21.....<br><br>- Sights placed on barrel instead of on the rifle body<br>- Scopes instead of iron sights<br>- Night aiming devices, e.g., red dot, laser aiming device<br>- Claims to be egronomically designed and tested<br>- Modular construction<br>- Use of plastics / composites<br>- Compact weapon<br><br>In fact the Vector CR21 looks more like the SAR-21 than the Tavor.<br><br>My point is that maybe all these rifles are developed independently, based on users who incidentially have the same requirements - a good accurate, reliable rifle that is easy to use and have minimal maintenance!!!<br><br>The fact that the implementation of it differs suggests different developmental tracks (not sure if they shared notes b/w them though....)<br><br><a href="http://world.guns.ru/assault/as26-e.htm" rel="nofollow">http://world.guns.ru/assault/as26-e.htm</a>  --&gt; Vector CR21<br><br></div>
