Give or take, prominently there would be more Chinese officers than Malays or Indians.<br><br>Plus, not forgetting, as we know, SAF policy on promotion people is not really fair to all ethnic groups, education level, etc, so we wont have better mix of capable people.<br><br>Problems with humans is the tendency to mark out differences between themselves and other groups, whether its nationality, race, religion, education, wealth, etc so the tendency to divide and demarcate is there.<br><br>On the other hand, the pasture is always greener than other side. I argued with a Malay friend. He respects the Chinese because of the drive and business minded approach to life, while I argue Malays are close knitted and open minded. In the end, we agreed the true meaning of "pasture is greener on the other side"<br><br>It boils down to individual personality and capability.

            <div class='col-md body'>I don't think racism exist much in the younger generations. The malays in the army works as hard as any chinese or indians. except for some individuals who loves to slack which happens to not only malays but chinese and indians. Chinese can get along well with malays in my company thus i do not think theres much racism in Singapore younger generations.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Simply said there are black sheep in every race who are racist whether they openly admit it or not. That is the cold hard truth. Agree? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I certainly think that Malay and Chinese can get along well. But sadly its natural that in general, Malay prefers Malay companionship and the same goes to Chinese. Maybe because each race has their own language and therefore it's more fun to talk to. and about tastes and interests.</div>
