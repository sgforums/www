            <div class='col-md body'>They have made a mistake in toppling Saddam by force...and thus the current mess. They should be responsible for this mess and clear this up by staying put in Iraq. They should withdraw when there is a proper democratic Iraqi government in place elected by the citizens in fair elections. The Iraqi police and army should also by then be able to protect its soverignty and keep the peace within its borders.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>The entire supplying arms to Sunnis to fight "insurgents" is gonna turn around and bite them in the ass.  The whole idea of staying in Iraq was to prevent Iraq from turning into a battleground between the Shiites and the Sunnis, and now look at what they are about to do?<br><br>How far will they go to believe that "The enemy of my enemy is my friend?"<br><br>The source of the entire problem here is not Iraq, Iran, Israel or US.  Its the oil.  I say we just nuke the damn oil fields.  Everybody ready for a trip back to the stone age?</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>there are only 2 views, Its either u agreed to go in or against it. All other justification are political.<br><br>The sad part of all is with all the politics on this issue.  The ideas of going in was lost, but the decision for not retreating is more than an oil decision. I believe the US also have to consider if the Sunni Saudi will fight against the Shia in iraq in the case of US withdrawer. Once it start we never know when is going to end. So we may be another tip of another big war.<br><br>The Democrats pull out of Somalia it will most likely do so with Iraq iregardless of consequences.<br><br>Now that the US lost the ground and is fighting against a protracted retreat.  There has been idea about redrawing the Middle east map.<br><br>I would be interested to find out if the sunni saudi fight with the shia where would be our neighbour position? Sunni or Shia?<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I am S'porean living in US. My Republican friends were all gung-ho for going into Iraq, now lan-lan, silent, as they watch soldiers die from IEDs, Iraqis kill each other. Even some of my Democrat friends were for the war (because Saddam was tyrant). Now most are unsure if staying or pulling out is the answer. One side say if pull out, Al Qaeda or Islamic extremists take-over iraq and spread to rest of Mideast, even come to fight on US soil, the other side say go ahead and pullout - whatever happens won't be as bad as Iraq is at present. Bush may say US soldiers are liberators, the soldiers are occupiers however you look at it. US is the only force to hold Iraq together. The moment it leaves, Iraq will break up. Already most of the good Iraqi doctors, lawyers and administrators are dead or have left Iraq. You cannot have democracy and peace if all sides don't want to live with each other. Of course, perception of US's credibility has plunged.<br><br>I think a more interesting question is what will happen bet. Sunni Arab states and Iran if US pulls out. If you haven't noticed, the sunni Arabs are on a weapon buying spree lately. The Saudis are buying Tornados and Typhoon Eurofighters with cruise missiles and AFVs, Egyptians are license making M1 Abrams MBT, UAE, Kuwaitis, Omanis and Qataris are buying Leclerc MBTs, F-16 Block 60+, Piranha and Pandur AFVs. I don't think such big purchases are meant for fighting Israel, they are meant for a nuclear Iran.</div>
