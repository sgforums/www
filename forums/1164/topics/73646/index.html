            <div class='col-md body'>aiya, I know this comment always appear that it is how good the pilot is that counts. But given the "same calibre" for the both the pilots and employing the best tactics for their respective plane, Mig 29 should eat F16 any day, that this comes from a Lockheed Martin research studies. I still have the article about this topic.<br><br>This is the very reason why Vipers need to be equipped with Helmet Mounted Sight and a 4th Gen WVR missiles to counter Mig 29 with AA-11 Archer to level the playing field.<br><br>You guys may ask why say the Mig 29 is better at dogfight, that's because it has got higher thrust to weight ratio and a lower wing loading ratio.<br><br>However, its 7G limit as compare to the F16 9G is a disadvantage. If Viper pilots can force a fight at the transonic region pulling high Gs, then Vipers will have a definite advantage. With HMS and Python, the envelope will increase even more. It will then become first look win situation.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Well,my money is on the F-16 if they are fighting dog-fights.Reason being that in dogfights,the aircrafts have to rely on tight turns and are constantly pulling Gs.Given the F-16 manoeuverbility it will beat the MiG-29.But if it is long range engagement,MiG-29 will win,due to its ability to rapidly close the gap and engage from afar.<br><br>But ever thought of Su-27 Flanker going hed to hed with F-16?That would be a hard one</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>when top gun was started back in 68/69 one of the instructors got into a shouting match with John Boyd(he is part of the "Fighter Mafia" group that created the F-16) at a conference. John was famous during that time when he came up with Energy-Maneuverability Theory, which  apply the thermo laws about the conservation and dissipation of energy into fighter tactics. during the talk he gave, he tried to convince the instructor that a MiG-17 will always out maneuver a Phantom. Mathematically, a Phantom can never win a MiG-17 according to Boyd.  But Top Gun proved otherwise.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>the F-16 vs Mig-29 thing was covered in a 1995 issue of CODE ONE, the lockheed martin mag. i lost tt issue some time ago... but IIRC it all started when a USAF F-16 sqn went to play DACT in decimomannu, italy vs luftwaffe Mig-29s.<br><br>of course, the article was biased towards the F-16 (it was a LM publication after all). but the general tone was that F-16 was superior in almost all practical aspects: radar, avionics, ergonomics, HOTAS, cockpit visibilty, turn rate, agility, engine life, efficiency etc etc...  but its big handicap was the lack of an off-boresight HMS-aided WVRAAM. R-73 simply thrashed AIM-9M. one quote i remember was from an F-16 pilot: "everytime we got close to a fulcrum, we'd be banking hard and dumping flares...."<br><br>that was a very interesting issue... it also had a pretty comprehensive article on the early development of the missile we know today as the AIM-9X. it was called the Boxoffice program back then... they actually had a thrust-vectored, off-boresight, HMS-aimed AIM-9 prototype back in 1995, took them so long to put it in production.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Brother, I don't seem to see the same stats you do with the page you sent. In terms of actual performance on the page you sent,<br><br>Mig29 has<br>- better max speed at low-level and altitude<br>- higher thrust to weight ratio<br>- higher rate of climb<br>- faster turn-rate<br>- higher maximum AAM launch distance<br>- lower maintenance hours<br>- higher mean time between failures<br><br>(anyway, who trusts these kind of statistics anyway?)<br><br>Never underestimate your adversary or your potential adversary (see how the US did with Pearl Harbour). We have to view comparison in a holistic, system-wise manner and that includes anything from aircraft performance to pilot performance, to maintenance and cost issues and integration with other systems (AWACS, C3, intelligence, air defence) Overall, on a systems comparison, I'd say Singapore wins but you never know what will happen in a shooting war, AWACS aircraft might be down, runways might be destroyed, pilots might have gone on a drinking binge the night before.<br><br>To base assumptions on national pride or on Mr Ah Beng telling you how cock-up the adversary is, is the road down to military failure.<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by zenden9:</div><div class="quote_body">I believe F-16 is no match compare to Mig-29 in terms of aircraft performance!

There was one interesting article in FLIGHT JOURNAL written by retired Rear USN Admiral Paul Gilchrist in 1998/99.<br><br>The premise is that the U.S. Navy should purchase the production rights for the SU-27/33 FLANKER and, equipped with US engines &amp;  electronics, put them into squadron service. This would provide the long-range &amp; heavy payload  capability of the dearly departed A-6 with the soon to be VERY dearly departed F-14's multi-role fighter qualities at a much better price than current plans for the E/F-model Hornet. Included in the article were several charts showing the inferiority of all the Hornets to the big boys like the F-14D and FLANKER in the range/payload/capability issues.<br><br>Finally found the article and here it is<br><a href="http://www.flightjournal.com/articles/su27/su27.asp" rel="nofollow">http://www.flightjournal.com/articles/su27/su27.asp</a><br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by HENG@:</div><div class="quote_body">MiGs anyday.<br>but anyone has an eye on the Sukhois and especially, the Yak-141?</div></blockquote></div>
