            <div class='col-md body'>who's talking about religion. Abu Sayyaf is a bandit group and even kill muslim guys from Indonesia taken hostage. all they want is cash, buy weapons, start a real insurrection, if succeed most probably would be corrupt and worsen the situation in Mindanao. hell there was even talk from GAM(Free Aceh Movement) militias to impose taxes on those passing the waters off Aceh. This is not about religion but about cash and power. Aceh is full of natural gas and oil. Course the govt and militias want to harness it. The problem with Indonesian forces though is they kill to many innocent civilians and ostracised the good guys to tell rebel positions and where they hiding. Just shows how much they ignored PSYOPS.<br>"Winning the hearts and minds"</div>

The Ultimax is arguably the best SAW weapon along with the M249 MiniMi.

The 100 live rounds drum mag with the SAW performed beautifully with sustained fire power without stoppages. All of the SAW gunners like to fire the live rounds (100) drum mag with the SAW.<br><br>When firing blanks, the SAW is a little letdown and always jamed. </div></blockquote>Haha ya i hear from all my friends that the saw is one of the most fun guns to fire.And the fact that it doesnt jam often is a plus</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>On the topic of SAWs-<br>Some time back, I seem to recall seeing a SAR21 SAW version with a heavy barrel, bipod and from the description - fires from an open bolt, on the former SAR21 website. The website no longer exists - and on ST's site, there is no mention of it anymore. I assume that the idea could be dropped (only the basic, GL, MMS and P-rail versions are shown now). If that is the case, will there be an improved Ultimax 100 (Mk 4?) or maybe even something new?</div>
