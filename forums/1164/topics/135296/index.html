Most of the spies worrying ASIO operate out of embassies under diplomatic cover, but some work under cover as businessmen or other professionals.<br><br>SPH also have spy in China...</div>

They'd sent back lots of information," he said.<br><br>Hao said he was formerly a police officer attached to a specialist security unit in northern Tianjin province monitoring Falungong, a group China has termed an evil cult, and had witnessed the torture of its practitioners.<br><br>He said he was prompted to speak out after hearing about Chen, who has been living in hiding with his wife and six-year-old daughter since leaving his job on May 26.<br><br>Australia's handling of the Chen case is being closely watched by the political opposition and refugee rights groups concerned that Canberra could place its burgeoning trade relations with China ahead of human rights.<br><br>Prime Minister John Howard launched multi-billion dollar free trade negotiations with China during a trip to Beijing in April and Australia is also keen to expand resource exports to China's booming economy.<br><br>Chen, 37, said on the weekend that he had asked for political asylum after becoming disillusioned with his work monitoring dissident groups but that his application was rejected by officials who did not even interview him.<br><br>The Chinese consulate-general has refuted Chen's claims, saying he has made up the stories so he can stay in Australia where he has lived for the past four years.<br><br>Foreign Minister Alexander Downer on Wednesday said that Chen had not formally applied for political asylum and was now being considered for a protection visa which would allow him to stay in the country.<br><br></div>
