              <p>Fulfilling National Service (NS) duties takes precedence over 
              personal goals, and it is not up to an individual to cherry-pick when to
               serve the nation, said a High Court judge today (Feb 11), as he 
              increased the sentence of an NS evader to one-and-a-half months’ jail.</p>
              <p>Justice
               Chan Seng Onn’s comments came as he allowed prosecutors’ appeal against
               the S$4,500 fine imposed on Brian Joseph Chow, 25, who had evaded 
              serving NS for more than six years.</p>
              <div class="left "></div>
              <p>Chow moved to Australia in 2005, claiming that the local 
              education system fell short in addressing his attention deficit 
              disorder.</p>
              <p>Two years later, he turned 16 years and six months old,
               and was required under the Enlistment Act to register for a valid exit 
              permit (VEP) to remain outside Singapore.</p>
              <p>But Chow never did, 
              ignoring four notices from the Ministry of Defence (MINDEF) between 
              January and May 2008 to register for NS. He claimed to be unaware of 
              these notices, and requested for deferment twice in 2009 to complete his
               four-year university education.</p>
              <p>The requests were turned down, 
              but Chow only returned to Singapore in May 2013 after graduating. He 
              then surrendered to the authorities and enlisted in November the same 
              year, going through specialist cadet school and combat intelligence 
              school. He has completed serving NS.</p>
              <p>Today, Justice Chan noted 
              that the defence policy is set by MINDEF, which gets to decide when and 
              how a male Singaporean would serve NS.</p>
              <p>In evading NS in favour of 
              his studies, Chow had gained an unfair advantage over his peers, said 
              the judge. Besides potentially dampening the morale and commitment of 
              other male Singaporeans, individuals who deferred NS could become less 
              suited for a combat role due to their relatively older age, and shorten 
              the window to fully complete their reservist duties, he added</p>
              <p>The 
              judge added that the sentencing of overseas defaulters was based on the 
              argument of fairness. The custodial threshold will generally be crossed 
              when an overseas defaulter who has a “substantial connection” to 
              Singapore remains overseas without a VEP for more than two years, he 
              said.</p>
              <p>In Chow’s case, he left Singapore after years of education, but his family resides here and he intended to do the same.</p>
              <p>“He
               therefore has and will reap the benefits of Singapore citizenship and 
              has, by delaying his NS obligations, violated the principles of equity 
              and universality and undermined the fair share argument,” said Justice 
              Chan.</p>
              <p>Factors that will influence the sentence for an offender 
              include the number of years he evades NS and whether he surrendered 
              voluntarily, while exceptional performance during NS could be a 
              mitigating factor and warrant a “discount” of penalties, he added.</p>
              <p>Justice
               Chan said he would have jailed Chow for slightly below three months if 
              not for his stellar performance in NS. His commanders had written 
              testimonials in support of his performance in NS.</p>
