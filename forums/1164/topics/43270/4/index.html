After all, the pilot is stating something obvious to all who have studied air combat, that it is more about violent manuvering, and hasty moves and counter moves to get the direction right instead of the clear-headed tatical game of wits you suggested. Air combat is a snappy and brutally simple thing, and unless you can play chess with 0.3 second turns, it is going to be hardly anything we would define as humanisticly refined. As a matter of fact, close in air combat would is inherently a messy, animalistic affair, probably why they call it "dogfighting" and "furball" rather then "airborne chess".</div>

The entire premise of this information sharing network is it's invulnerability and reduncancy to damage.
