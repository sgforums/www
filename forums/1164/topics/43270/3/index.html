The entire point of UCAV and such unmanned technology is to get the dudes out of the line of fire, and that's what matters.<br><br>If I were to follow your logic, I would conclude that equipping troops with good weapons and body armor encourages them to be slack when they fight, so I should make them go in with arcadic weapons and no protection except their own hide so that when their butt is on the line, they fight better. Nonsense.<br><br>It is the very reason that their lives are on the line, that's why they can't hit the target, not because their are at the risk of being killed, they can! Wheverever did you get that reasoning! Pls use brain, hello. Witness vietnam when US pilots would dump bombs at the sight of a mig. I'm sure they're hitting their targets... Human nature will cause them to heck care hitting the targets, drop their bombs and get out when they can, not encourage them to carry out their mission sucessfully! When your butt is on the line, you aim for the minimum requirements to get out, and if that's dumping bombs and missing everything or not getting anywhere close, that's what we'll do!<br><br>Putting pilots (which themselves cost more then a UCAV to train and are ahrder to replace) in the cockpit to send on some mission that a UCAV can do with less risk and greater effectiveness on some justification holding their life hostage so that they will fly their best lacks logic. It's like that guy who said that we should dump our falcons and go back to hunters because operating them is far more dangerous! No! That's crazy, that's nuts in war. You dun take unnecessary risks like that, aircrew, unlike UCAVs, cannot be easily replaced, and even if you do, there is going to be an attrition in general quality of aircrew! It's sucide! UCAV attrition on the other hand, can be sustained and is cheaper and easier to manage.<br><br>Tell me which is a greater vulnerability, losing aircrew which is hard to replace because you put their butt on the line to knock out some vietcong on the ground or losing a UCAV to jamming? (A vulnerabilty that is now being managed by making the UCAV automous in the event of signal loss where it will complete it last orders and return home)<br><br>When you can program a UCAV to dodge enemy air defences better then a pilot can (which they already did), and penetrate deeper into enemy airspace (which they already can) and loiter tireless and work 24/7 without tiring (which they can), tell me which is a superior system.<br><br>The fighter pilot, to put it lightly, is gonna get the boot once UCAV technology is prefected and. There's just no reason for them anymore, unless you are in the habit of throwing away lives and cash needlessly.<br><br>I am appaled by the lack of proper thought in your line of reasoning. </div></blockquote>Actually what you have said makes even less sense then me.Why?Well are the soldiers though equiped with all that high tech gear present on the battlefield?YES.Is the pilot equiped with "bulletproof vests" and all the other high tech gismos?Yes in the form on jammers and BVR missiles.By my example the frontline soldiers would be replaced by robots and sure that sounds all dandy by cutting down on human losses but are you really sure robots would be better?Would they have the gut feeling to make decisions on the battlefield condition and assumations?Sure the tech can do that but would he make a bad mistake and commit to attack even if chances of it failing is high?Could the failure of that attack result in the total distruction of the line??Would the tech even care???What would happen if the command center is taken out or the link up is destoryed??Too many but's and if's!The time is not yet right for Robots to completely replace the human in the armed forces.Sure they are showing great progress up the technology is still too new to be phased in fully within the next 8-15 years.<br><br>To use your own quote <blockquote>I am appaled by the lack of proper thought in your line of reasoning</blockquote></div>

Actually AI engineers are projecting a computing system that is no larger then your average PC CUP, with current technology. It hardly requires supercomputing power. I wun go so far as to say the UCAV MUST win a dogfight, but I can be pretty certain that it will be able to do so a large number of times.<br><br>In terms of technology, the technology already exists to make UCAVs smart enough to dogfight (the basic manuvers were from fighter pilots themselves) and engage in BVR engagements (in which case the UCAV has an advantage).<br><br>Another thing, esp with multiaspect missiles coming on line which can aquire targets in a 360 sphere around an aircraft, doing extensive manuvers to dogfight will also become less important. What matters is who gets off the first shot, and who dodges missiles the best. Are you telling me, a human pilot that can at best make desisions at 0.1 sec and pull 9 gees will be able to evade missiles better then a computer drone that reacts within nanoseconds of the missile launch and launches into pre programed erratic manuvers that would kill a pilot that probabaly pull as much gees as the missile itself.<br><br>And no, if you have any basic idea computing engineering, you will know that this tasks do not require the power of 12 super crays, but can be reduced to a remarkable package the size of your PC.<br><br>Having said that, how on earth would a pilot be able to shoot down a UCAV with missiles in the first place, and how would he survive if a UCAV shot missiles at him? He could try the gun, but then again, a properly programmed UCAV would evade his attempts. The computer just thinks and acts way too fast for any pilot to keep up with.<br><br>Again, to smash your repeated old points, computer vulnerabilities can be managed, and is a moot point, because it is also one in an advanced manned fighter. If the computer of an F-22 dies, the plane is unflyable itself and the pilot will have be eject. Same thing with the UCAV. Unless the comps of the UCAV are inherently less reliable then that of a manned fighter, this would be a point, which is not the case.<br><br></div>

But what I am trying to point out to you, and is something you are apparently unwilling to see is that in the near future (within twenty years), UCAVs are going to take the roles I have suggested, well, actually not me, I am just rehasing the points the people who came up with such concepts did.<br><br>In short, the F-22 will probably be the one of the last generations, if not the last of manned air combat aircraft.

Some people still think that we will never reach the moon, but some others, and an increasing number of people are already seeing that there is no reason why we cannot land a man on the moon.<br><br>I'm just looking at this from an impartial point of view, but I suspect EXCO needs to get over some "white scarf"<br><br>Sorry, my two cents worth.<br></div></blockquote>Nonono, you didn't get what I mean.<br><br>Do not forget that UCAVs are controlled by Humans sitting in a room. The issue ultimately boils down to this. How do you, and can you transmit enough information so that the SA of the human operator is equivalent, if not better than the pilot in the air? You would quite literally need 360 degree cameras. That alone will cause a bottleneck in the datalink. All the data will have to be sent in split-second as well. If you are talking about datalinks for Apaches and F-22s, You are looking the wrong way. Those provide only data, worded data. What we are talking about here is a major broadband network which does not exist. That network is supposed to carry, to and fro, all inputs from the operator, and all the viewpoints on the UCAV. Not forgetting datalinks with other UCAV, other manned assets in theatre, and radar/tracking data. That is what my whole point revolves around. Even if it is possible, can the SA of an operator sitting in an air-conditioned room, with no feeling whatsoever of being in the air, be better than that of a pilot in the air?<br><br>As for the point on computing power. Once again I have to stress that it is not a game. Dogfighting is *not* simply about pointing in the correct direction and shooting. If you think it is, once again you are looking the wrong way. It could have been damned easy. I call up a few guys at EA, ask them to enhance the AI codes for their fighter games, and I put it into a UCAV. Case closed. Isn't that what you are trying to say? Isn't what I said laughable? That is exactly what you are telling me.<br><br>This is not about Human ego. Seriously, who wants to put their lives at stake? It is simply about having an army of bots is not feasible at all.<br><br>Another issue is the one of cost and security. The cost of developing such a network architecture, making sure it is 100% workable, scalable, and safe, is not cheap. Heck, developing such a UCAV itself will cost a lot.<br><br>How are you going to ensure that the system is going to be safe? Both from opponent hackers, jammers, and domestic system downs. The rate of progress for computers is so fast that the technology for protecting them simply cannot catch up. The moment a piece of data leaves the UCAV, it is going to be monitored by your opponents. You may shield it, but you cannot hide it. Do not forget that all I have mentioned will have to travel thru the air, maybe even bounced off satellites. That decreases the efficiency of such a system even more.</div>

The US military is actually calling on a team made out of game designers, military people, and DoD people to come up with mission preformance AI for their next generation of advanced cruise missiles and UCAV platforms. And that includes AI that will enable such platforms to actually tangle in active combat, in addition to evasive and mundane mission subroutines.<br><br>What is happening is that the idea is to make the AI itself modular and seperate from the rest of the software that actually does the targeting, flying the aircraft and what so. And that's what the US military is doing now, calling on game developers to help them in the development of their artifical intelligence.<br><br>I also remember a slight test they did in the early 1990s in a book I read some time back that I am now trying to find, where the put a few simple automated hardcoded subroutines into a QF target drone (the one they usually use to haul radar reflectors to confuse enemy radar in one of shunk works stealth programs). These commands told the drone how to react whenever a mounted threat reciever told them that they were being targeted or there was something chasing them, and basically that was to go into a series of erratic crazy 20 gee manuvers and pump out chaff and flares.<br><br>And they launched that thing from a B-52, and pitted it against F-15 aircraft, which were ordered to try to shoot it down. The drone survived <span style="font-style: italic;">50</span> dogfights and dodge no less then 24 aircraft and many times that number of simulated missile launches against it.<br><br>I believe that was a study into the feasibility of making drone aircraft and cruise missiles smart enough to avoid getting shot down, but I think the interest in such research was dropped in the favour of making more smart munitions and it was not remembered until recently.<br><br>And all this was done with computing technology at the time when a good flight simulator was considered Microprose's F-15 Strike Eagle 2.<br><br>I'm still trying my best to dig out the article so I can quote it, but I remember it quite clearly. I suspect it could be buried in one of the 12,000 pages of TakeOff Magazine I have.<br><br>The whole gist of the matter is, if anything this experiment proves, you dun need super crays to make computing power for a UCAV to fight fighter pilots. If you write good enough software for a automated UCAV to dodge and run through a evasive routine whenever it determines it is in threat. And also subroutines to make it aquire and fire back weapons at that theat, and do all that stuff while following a mission flight plan. There is no reason to see why UCAVs cannot hold their own against manned aircraft.<br><br>And better, since UCAV can be designed to make turns in several times multitude that of a normal fighter pilot can, it will be no trouble for the UCAV to just snap about a J turn to face it's opponent (assuming it even needs to face its opponent, given development into networked sensor enhanced AA missiles) and snap off a shot. It does not have to engage in a game of energy manuvering in a limited airframe playing airborne chess until somebody screws up. There's no need to, when you can turn far tighter then your opponent.<br><br>I think the logic will be self-apparent if you ask fighter pilots if they want to dogfight something that can make 30 gee turns and snap around to face them (if you calculate, that's a 180 turn taking only 1 second at 450 knots while a manned aircraft takes 3-4 seconds to make the same reversal at nearing 10 gees) assuming they can even get on it's tail.<br><br>In the light of this, I doubt there will be much dogfighting in a sense against UCAVs at all, not unless manned aircraft can keep up and preform UCAV like manuvers. No matter how good the pilot, the plane also plays a very big part. The red baron in his triplane is not going to prevail against an average fighter jock F-16 no matter how many times better the german may be, not unless the F-16 pilot does something stupid that is.</div>

You are assuming that there can be no safe system enough for the UCAV to operate (in that case, the USAF might as well scrape them right now). Most of these concerns you stated of system security seem to be unfounded, partly so because these are part and parcel of any military operation. And obviously the USAF has figured out these problems to a large enough extent that their long term plan (sorry, not near moonbase era) is to replace a large portion of their force with unmanned platforms. You are talking about the replacement of many makes of manned aircraft like the F-16, A-10 and what so have you with something entirely new and different.<br><br>What is evident from the evidence we are seeing is that, UCAV technology has advanced to a point where it is possible to operate them, and do so combat effectively. What it indicates, is that these vulnerabilities can be, and have been managed. It is certainly not foolproof, but apparently reliable enough that the USAF is hardly expressing pessimism about such technology. Not unless you want to take the fool's path of arguing for 100 percent security that is, which is impossible.<br><br>On the other hand, history has shown manned aircraft are far less reliable in terms of survability and durability and increasingly expensive.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I agree with ST in the area of manned aircraft vs. UCAV dogfighting. The rules here are rewritten.<br><br>That is because funky (and basic) air combat moves like high yoyo, low yoyo, esp the sis and the verti version which are staple moves of air combat only applies to aircraft that are more or less similar in preformance envelopes, with turn factor being the king factor.<br><br>That's why countries spend so much to try to be the top of this by making aircraft that can do these kinds of moves the best. If you can't do all these air combat moves the best, that means to have the most energy and turn the tighest (the two main things of air combat school) are those who will fly home from the fight.<br><br>The problem is, humans cannot take accelerations above 10 gs, and anything at 13 or more sustained will kill. So this means that the best yo yo or vert. sis can only be done at most 10 (even this is not adviced, because most pilots will be near enough to g-loc that their SA is zero and they are sitting ducks)<br><br>Hence we see more creative combat moves like J-turn, extreme AoA and cobra coming up these days that are trying to afford solutions to get the all important nose around without killing the pilot. But these are only stopgap measures.<br><br>The UCAV rewrites all these rules. Without the pilot, the designers can make an airplane that can easily pull over 30 g and even do negative g moves with the same amount of force (humans die at negative 5 g)<br><br>This completely rewrites the air combat school book. If a pilot is pitted in a dogfight against a UCAV, he will immediately lose because he simply can't outmanuver the UCAV. In fact, the UCAV does not even have to be caught up in all the staple air combat moves that fighter school teaches because it is too far ahead of the fighter pilot abilities to even be caught up in anything like a vert. sis fight (something we always see in the movies but very rare and only happens when true aces meet, like Cunniham and Col. Tomb in vietnam).<br><br>ST is correct to say that they dun need to make the UCAV fight the fighter pilot on his terms and turf, that's because when they meet, the fighter pilot will have to try to outfly the UCAV on it's terms. And that's going to be very difficult, meaning the pilot is at a disadvantage.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I have been reading this thread with great interest, and here is my 2 cents worth:<br><br>I believe from all the reading so far that UCAVs for now and in the very near future, would not be able to replace or defeat a manned agile aircraft like the Typhoons, Raptors, SU-30 series, Rafales, etc in an air to air combat. Reason, simple enough, UCAVs cannot think tactics. Yes, as SgDino has pointed out that you can make a UCAVs go zip-zap to avoid incoming missiles, pulling high Gs. Yes, a UCAVs will be able to pull GT 9gs whereas a human pilot is limited to not more than 9. However, today's AAMs can certainly pull higher Gs than any UCAVs. Rafael Python 4 can pull 60gs. AIM-9X can do similar. The no-escape zone for AAM will encompass any UCAVs anyone can built. This essentially negates a UCAVs advantage to pull higher Gs than human aircraft theory. It is the first look kills scenarios.  In this first-look kill scenarios, I have to say that a skilled human pilot with a 20-20 vision will win the day. Yes, I have no doubt that UCAV kill ratio will be close, but I think so far technology cannot substitute human's adaption and being able to react faster to tactical changes, ie. humans are capable of individual thinking whereas machines are being taught. Even current and near future AI wouldn't come close to human's ability. This is the very same argument used in Star Trek Next generation's Data character.<br><br>Secondly,  most future A2A battle will not be fought in WVR environment. It would naturally be BVR environment. And logic tells us that the bigger the platform, the bigger the radar the platform can carry. The bigger the radar, the longer distant it can detect. Thus once again, manned aircrafts win.<br><br>Ok, lets talk about current UCAVs development. Taking from 2 different streams of development, eg, US UCAVs, and Sweden UCAVs.<br><br>US UCAVs are basically designed for ground strike modes. That calls for the UCAVs to be design with high degree of stealth, range and payload capabilities.

Human race will be made irrelavant.<br><br>[/b]</blockquote>Erm actually military analysts indicate that in a BVR engagement, a UCAV has the inherent advantage. This is because the UCAV will inherently be able to carry the critical 30 percent more sensors or weapons or anything else you want to cram in the platform then a manned aircraft. You point only works when you suggest that UCAVs will be inherently smaller then that of modern combat aircraft, which does not have to be always true. Even going by your reasoning, it can be reasoned that a UCAV with similar radar capability will be 30 percent smaller, and also we are counting in the stealthier nature of the UCAV because it's form does not have to accomidate a human pilot (50 percent of the F-22 rcs comes from it's canopy). In a BVR, a UCAV will have a large advantage.<br><br>As for no-escape zones, you must be aware that <span style="font-style: italic;">it is not fixed and</span> differs with aircraft with difference preformances. Usually the figure you see for no-escape zones for most missiles you read about have been tuned to a maximum of the 9-10 gees target manuvering envelope. The tighter the target can turn (or faster it can fly), the smaller the no-escape zone becomes. If you use an AIM-120 to try to shoot down an aircraft, the no-escape zone is certainly much larger then if you are trying down to shoot down, say another missile.<br><br>Hence a manuvering UCAV's no escape zone is actually three times smaller, and manuvering aside, a computerized UCAV can react and pump out countermeasures with timing far better then that of any human pilot before, or after missile launch. Hence the chances of it coming out unscathed is far in excess of that of a manned aircraft, as a simple QF drone has already shown. To get within a UCAV's no-escape zone for your missile, you have to manuver into a envelope three times smaller, and I doubt these things present themselves in air combat much.<br><br>I'm not sure how getting show down by robots makes humans irrevelant. These things were made by humans in the first place. Besides, robots have been shooting down humans in air combat for a long time liao, witness all the air to air kills with missiles <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br></div>

Already the US army has experimented with networking up to <span style="font-style: italic;">2,000 micro drone buggies</span> that they intend to launch from a mothership to overwhelm a house with tasers or tear gas as their subsitute for bloody FIBUA. It's one of their unmanned projects and I'll pass you the link once I can scrounge it up. The fact is, such networking is far from impossible.<br><br>To understand how, what you are suggesting is a top down network that has to share all the resources in between. Such a network is based on a model of how human organizations usually do things.<br><br>But the network model that has come up with to figure out how to network multiple units with little latency is the bottom up, or ant-colony approach. Where units are networked together in a form of collective intelligence, rather then centralized intelligence. This delocalized network model makes it possible to link up an indefinate number of units, coordinate and make them them do the stuff you want as a team.<br><br>The ant-colony approach that they are now look to. This also means that the network is incredibly robust, because it's intergity is decentralized. The only way to destroy this network is to kill every single one of the drones. Such a network requires minimal external computing power to support at all as the drones all provide to the overall coordination and network, like an ant colony. As a matter of fact, the more drones you have the better, because the overall oordination and ability of the network will increase. Of course, the disadvantage to this system is that you have less localized control over each individual, as compared to the computing extensive traditional model you suggested. But this is the network model defence planners intend to use for their future extensive drone networks, as it applies to the supernet of other sensors and units.<br><br>On dogfighting, I did not come up with that idea. One F-15 pilot said it pretty much himself during aerospace to sum up dogfighting.<br><br>"It's nothing like the stuff you see in the movies that you have to come up with complex plans to outfly your enemy. It's just basically a matter of pointing you aircraft in the right direction faster then he can, and shooting."<br><br>When asked on what that meant, it was that dogfighting was a brutally simple affair that usually only takes snap seconds to conclude, tatical thinking and human brain mumbo jumbo greatly absent. Get you nose right fast and blast him out before he can.<br><br></div>

But modern airfoils and exotic aircraft forms can easily make snap turns, go into controled stalls and reverse heading. The problem is, while all these exotic manuvers have been made possible with emerging technology, the basic limit of human endurance is still there. Humans can only do these manuvers under limited circumstances lest they kill themselves if they push it too far. If you do a J-Turn too hard, which involves negative as well as side to side gees (usually takes about 8 seconds to do) you'll stroke yourself and turn your plane into a flying coffin that will intersect the ground shortly. A UCAV can exceute the same manuver easily eight times faster.<br><br>A UCAV can take full advantage of this new genre of flying, and yes, they provide an extreme advantage in combat. To fight a UCAV in air combat would be a nightmare, because it will be akin to flying against a airborne turret that can face anywhere it wants far faster then you can. Hardly anything I would go into with the pretext that the human will always prevail.<br><br>If the human could fight the UCAV on fair terms and even ground, I'm sure we'll win more of the times, but this is not the case. The UCAV has inherent advantages in air combat manuvering, and these advantages are huge, akin to the difference between a camel sopswhip and a F-8 Crusader. It's a revolution of difference.</div>
