By every measure, the Raptor represents extraordinary breakthroughs in maneuverability, stealth, sensor fusion Â– a wealth of parameters that define a new era in fighter capability.<br><br>The origins of the F/A-22 can be traced to the early 1970s, when the U.S. Air Force began studying concepts for replacement of its F-15 air superiority fighter. This became a formal program when the service requested proposals for an Advanced Tactical Fighter (ATF) in October 1985. The simple fact: New air and ground threats were looming that the F-15 would not be able to counter.<br><br>Now these threats will be defeated by the highly lethal and survivable F/A-22, with its balance of increased speed and range, enhanced offensive and defensive avionics, and reduced observability. The design of the F/A-22 also emphasizes reliability and maintainability of systems.<br><br>The F/A-22 is capable of flying and fighting against the most advanced integrated radar networks and dense surface-to-air missile environments in the world Â– now and in the future. A new generation of fighters is under development in several countries around the world today. The advent of these new fighters, as well as the continuing export of current air defense and adversary advanced fighter technology to the Third World, put the United StatesÂ’ ability to gain and maintain air superiority, much less air dominance, at increasing risk. The F/A-22 will retain the competitive edge through innovations and technologies no one can match.<br><br>In early 2001, the U.S. Air Force introduced a concept called Global Strike Task Force in which the F/A-22 Raptor is the enabler for all other forces. The success of any major air-land operation Â– today and in the future Â– depends primarily on the United StatesÂ’ preeminent ability to detect and destroy enemy fighters as well as attack high-value ground targets with precision weapons.<br><br>With the F/A-22, the era of U.S. air dominance Â– against all ground- and air-based threats Â– has begun<br></div>

In a dogfight, the UCAV is bound to lose. 1) The human brain still has the advantage in dogfights. AI will not be able to deduce the next move an opponent may make, and AI simply responds according to how it is programmed to react to a certain maneuver. 2) Pulling 30G turns creates its own problems. Unless the operator of the UCAV has a view which is superior to one in a manned aircraft, pulling 30Gs will end up with the UCAV not knowing where it is pointing.<br><br>In the foreseeable future, UCAVs will still be operated by humans. Do not forget that point, unless you are talking about Star Wars technology.</div>

In fact, most fighter pilots themselves admit that UCAVs can provide a lot more capabilities then they can. It's not in the far future at all, it's only a matter of time.

What is actual fact, is that UCAVs are considerably smaller (30 percent) then manned aircraft, and the elimination of the meat from the system means that it frees up space used for life support and all that other rubbish for sensors, weapons and engines.<br><br>But what is important, is not the size, but the ability of the UCAV to remove the element of human risk from the picture and free up mission capability to do things no humanely possible if there was some meat in the system. If you have to select between two systems, one that risks a pilot that takes millions to train, whose lifespan in battle is measured in hours in an aircraft that at best can make 9+ gees and with a maximum speed of 2.5 mach and enduarance limited by the pilot against a system which only risks the system itself, can be pushed to limits that would kill any human, and not to mention carry more space for engine, weapons and sensors that would have been taken up for life support instead.<br><br>If managed, the vulnerabilities of UCAV systems actually present a cast increase in tatical ability over the manned aircraft. Even your supposed 360 degree view is highly misleading. The issue here is not view, but situtational awareness. (BTW, adding cams dun increase system size much at all, dunno where your flawed logic come from). If the 21st century concept of sensor intergration is put into the UCAV, which I'm sure the amerians will do, what the UCAV operator will get is not a multiple screen view like a secuity system, but a single, unified three-dimentional display of easy to grasp information showing the situtational display in detail that no oxygen starved pilot pulling gees can ever hope to grasp.<br><br>Air combat is fought like a video game. If you put the gamer in the cockpit and force him to go through all of the motions his control unit has to go through versus one that is sitting outside the system and can see the big picture immediately without having to look around and glance and displays and HUDs, logic tells you who's going to win. The pilot has to see his target, read weapons status, endure manuvers and at the same time digest all this in order to fight. The UCAV operatior just has to look at the information coming in from the sensor network (does not even have to be sesnors on his system) point his aircraft and shoot. Game over.</div>

You have confused the design priorities of the UCAV.<br><br>I really don't know how to respond to your point that dogfights are just pointing in the right direction and shooting. On one hand you may have got the essence correct, but on the other hand that is an extremely simplistic and ignorant way of putting it. I won't justify the point.<br><br>GAME AI remains what it is. It is a damned GAME. Basically the computer responds to the moves a human pilot makes. It is extremely easy to fool the computer by making maneuvers which only a human can - as only the human brain can. If that is what dogfighting is all about, anyone could be an ace.<br><br>Manned aircraft senile? Thats the biggest folly anyone can make. Humans should never allow computers to fight for them. The rate of progress for using computers in war is miles ahead of the technology for protecting the computers. I stress that computers are prone to failing. There will never be a computer which will not fail.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by SingaporeTyrannosaur:</div><div class="quote_body">You are wrong on almost all counts. What is actual fact, is that UCAVs are considerably smaller (30 percent) then manned aircraft, and the elimination of the meat from the system means that it frees up space used for life support and all that other rubbish for sensors, weapons and engines.<br><br>But what is important, is not the size, but the ability of the UCAV to remove the element of human risk from the picture and free up mission capability to do things no humanely possible if there was some meat in the system. If you have to select between two systems, one that risks a pilot that takes millions to train, whose lifespan in battle is measured in hours in an aircraft that at best can make 9+ gees and with a maximum speed of 2.5 mach and enduarance limited by the pilot against a system which only risks the system itself, can be pushed to limits that would kill any human, and not to mention carry more space for engine, weapons and sensors that would have been taken up for life support instead.<br><br>If managed, the vulnerabilities of UCAV systems actually present a cast increase in tatical ability over the manned aircraft. Even your supposed 360 degree view is highly misleading. The issue here is not view, but situtational awareness. (BTW, adding cams dun increase system size much at all, dunno where your flawed logic come from). If the 21st century concept of sensor intergration is put into the UCAV, which I'm sure the amerians will do, what the UCAV operator will get is not a multiple screen view like a secuity system, but a single, unified three-dimentional display of easy to grasp information showing the situtational display in detail that no oxygen starved pilot pulling gees can ever hope to grasp.<br><br>Air combat is fought like a video game. If you put the gamer in the cockpit and force him to go through all of the motions his control unit has to go through versus one that is sitting outside the system and can see the big picture immediately without having to look around and glance and displays and HUDs, logic tells you who's going to win. The pilot has to see his target, read weapons status, endure manuvers and at the same time digest all this in order to fight. The UCAV operatior just has to look at the information coming in from the sensor network (does not even have to be sesnors on his system) point his aircraft and shoot. Game over.</div></blockquote>Wrong on all counts?? Flawed Logic?? thats a pretty high pedestal you are standing on.<br>The present technology would probably allow simple missions for UAVs. Dropping smart Munitions and probably standoff attacks like launching phoenixes. The day you would see an AI in a UAV beat a pilot in a dog fight is still very far away(note that i did not say never). Imagine the hardware and the soft ware required for such a combat UAV. First the hardware, then the armour needed for the hardware, then the system backup which probably would have to be stored in a separate compartment. It is still a lot of space.<br><br>. Also to provide the virtual 3d environment that you described how much more equipment would you require to be mounted on the UAV. present simulations are simulations, not live data fed from the field. in order to present the controller the required information imagine the equipment required.<br>Take not that i mentioned combat UAVs would be smaller i didn't say it would be so large so that it would be the same size as conventional fighters. but imagine the equipment that is required for a self-sufficient UAV that is able to intepret situation accurately would be emitting so much radar and comms that it would be an easy target for missles.<br>Also you did not answer my other points. If the UAV is remote controlled wouldn't the matter of jamming the comms signals be all too simple. Also the 3d environment you mentioned would mean a large control center for a single plane, so how much space do you need for a squadron. And will it all be centralized, if so, wouldn't it be very vulnerable. To make it less vulnerabvle you would need backup controll centers, more space, more money.<br>AI and technology is not at the required level for a self contained UAV and a remote controlled one has too many weakness, too many bottlenecks.<br>Your optimism with UAV is admirable but i am almost tempted to say you have been so seduced by technology that you have been dragged out of context and out of reality. But reality is technolgy has not stepped up to what you envisioned.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Ah ha, I never said any system would be flawless in preformance at all times, much less the UCAV. As a matter of fact, no system, human driven or not, will be error free. It was by your own flawed logic and lack of understanding of my stated points that you assumed that the UCAV was superior becos it was infailable. Not quite. And another leap of faith you ask us to take is to assume that human error is somehow not as threatening as equipment failure and hence a manned unit will be suprior. Hardly, go ask all the jokers who suffered friendly fire or flew their aircraft into mountains.<br><br>What matters is that this percentage be driven down to acceptable levels, and it will be, if it has not been already done.<br><br>What the UCAV is in fact, a system that fills in the role of the combat aircraft, and that is the concept of bringing munitions to target in battlespace. And it does that job, far cheaper, with less logisitcs, and with far lower risk to life then any manned combat aircraft can.<br><br>The point stands. The way things are going, UCAVs are going to eveuntally replace the manned combat aircraft. As the combat aircraft replaced the war airship.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>By the way, if anybody who think that UCAVs cannot prevail against manned aircraft better think twice. A US demostrator target drone survived 50 dogfights against F-15 aircraft. And not to mention would have shot down many of those F-15s had they been more then just target drones.</div>

But tireless AI relying on electronic sensors would probably be far more reliable then battle weary pilots who have to digest sensor output info who drop on friendly troops.<br><br>To scoff at the UCAV as not being able to be trusted with weapons is like scoffing at cruise missiles for carrying their warheads. As a matter of fact, if anything, these things are probably far more reliable and safer then meat in airframe airborne combat units.

UCAV operators will be far cheaper to train, easier to find, and not to mention protect. For a combat pilot, you are literally throwing a million dollar investment into great peril in fragile piece of metal hurtling through the air in a threat enviromnent. Appeals to testorone, but not very smart in the light of safer ways of getting firepower to the enemy via the air. You tell me which one is a greater vulnerability.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Why not? And besides that's the trend in the future, at least in america's stragety: to reduce the amount of human operators in the battle space. There's also a trend going on to seperate the sensors from the firing platform, using sensor network intergration instead. This is the 21 century boyo, time for lots of change to take advantage of emerging technology. To be traditionally retentive and conservative about such thing gives you flawed logic to argue for the contuined usefullness of manned platforms.</div>
