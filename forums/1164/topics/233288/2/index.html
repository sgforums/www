            <div class='col-md body'>Can't help but talk about football.<br><br>Looks like we really need a 2-goal lead in order to convince them that we can truly beat them.<br><br>Pity about the thai mishap... but they way they handled the whole ref decision was a tatical lose all from the start. If they insisted on their protest Singapore would have won automatically (not to mention disgrace their own team of their treatment of the whole system). But even if they had stopped their protest and gone on with the game, which they did... the wind in their sails were mostly gone.<br><br>After their own dubious goal (which exploited a distracted Singapore defence after protesting a penalty not awarded for a foul), they pretty much had the Lions off balance and were on the offensive, their protest had the net result of distrupting their offensive, blunting their mental focus on the match, as well as cooling them down from all the exercise (the Lions were keeping warm waiting for them to return). After the protest the thai team were certainly in no condition to take on the Lions, as the Singaporean post-protest dominance of the match showed.<br><br>Ironically the thai goalie would have stood a better chance of stopping that penalty had they not gone on the protest... if they didn't intend to go all the way through with their protest, they pretty much seal their own fate... which they did.<br><br>Guess this is what happens when you don't keep a cool head, but half the battle's over only, they will certainly learn from their mistakes and it is well within their skill to make a comeback.<br><br>I have a feeling it's going to be a brutal match, the thais certainly aren't going to leave any of their tricks behind. In any case it's going to be an interesting match.<br><br></div>
