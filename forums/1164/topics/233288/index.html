            <div class='col-md body'>indeed these so call thai leaders are trying to divert attention since they cock up so many times and have become the world's laughing stock. Just like some other incompetent leaders from our neighbours. Sigh just our luck to have to put up with these useless shit heads.<br><br>However this time I also feel that we have to be more mindful about our neighbour's feeling too. Since this thai govt is so shaky, incompetent and afraid of Thaksin, we shouldn't have given them a chance to bark no matter whatever strong reasons we have, for what Thaksin is allowed to do in SG. If Thaksin was not allowed to be interviewed in Sg and also he can always chat with our DPM over phone instead of meeting "privately", then chances of the Thai military govt will bark is much lower. And we can avoid the noise and continue to enjoy MASSAGE-ZEE in thailand peacefully  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"></div>

Apparently you still do not understand what was meant by responsibility. Does it help if I were to start ranting about something and insulting someone? What you're implying is that people are free to insult the Thai king? That must be what you mean by free since everyone is entitled to their own opinions.<br><br>Responsibility is knowing what is right and what is wrong and not coming up with inflammatory remarks that are unjustifiable and only serves to hurt the feelings of others without constructive contribution to the ongoing discussion.<br><br>Generally its fine to be talking about politics in an open forum but this being a MILITARY forum, it is better to exclude politics here, there are other channels like the politics forum. <strong>The current Thai junta has already showed a good example that MILITARY and POLITICS do not mix well</strong>.</div>

Just purely for financial reasons are are there really some hidden agendas?<br><br>I don't know anything or suspects anything but it is always good to ask difficult questions instead of just accepting everything at face value.</div></blockquote>No.  We should not retaliate with economic boycotts on the Thais.  Firstly, its really very unfair for the Thai people since this was not something that they wanted.  They did not ask for the coup, but rather it was forced upon them.<br><br>InfoComms is the big thing developing now.  Its natural that if we want to become an infocomms hub in the region, we should acquire telecoms companies around us.  Its not necessarily to seek military advantage, but a head start when the region moves to expand and develop their infocomms sector.<br><br>I cannot imagine what kinda plans the govt has made to secure the infocomms sector for Singapore to stay viable.  But I can imagine, being able to solidify a hold on Telecoms companies around us being part of the strategy.  Win-Win situation for developing countries around us, and for us as well.</div>
