Better solution would be more and better SAMs. My friends in ADA all complain that our missiles are kinda short-range and that the mainstay of our ADA force are actually the I-Hawks. Anyway, manpower wise should not be a problem. First-generation PRs no need to serve but all second-generation male PRs have to serve NS. </div></blockquote>That is part of the solution. You're right when you say that the SAF's ADA capabilities need a huge shot in the arm. The problem has been examined before on this forum, and I believe the reason it has lagged is due to funds being used for aircraft, as well as the capabilities (or lack thereof) of the air forces of our potential threats in the past few decades. However that is changing, so it is time to keep up!<br><br>However, SAMs lack the mobility to respond to a changing tactical situation the way aircraft could, which is why I still think getting a small number of STOVL F-35s, along with upgrading our ADA capabilities is the answer</div>

And comparing the 2 MPAs that appeared at the 1998 and 2003 Open Houses, there are some equipment added between those years that I suspect might be related to ASW work. For obvious reasons I won't say more.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>My take on the developement of our Armed forces is to become a highly mobile force in line with the Blitzkrieg doctrine: Strike fast and strike hard, since our economy cannot sustain a protracted conflict.<br><br>Most of the infantry units should be mechanised eventually (Not all at once given our economic capability) and we really should look into getting a few medium (not heavy) armour to complement the main bulk of light tanks (for the shock effect). A battery of MRLS should be on the cards in the long run, adding to the firepower of our artillery arm (not to mention the strategic deterrence factor).<br><br>The developement of an amphibious force (maybe a brigade) would be a nice option, giving an extra dimension to the force. (Remember the impact of the Inchon landings during the Korean war)<br><br>Our logisitics (most people always forget this is the most impt branch during a conflict) should be able to meet with the requirements for such a rapid mobility force such that mistakes shown by the US Army during the recent GW2 do not happen.<br><br>I admit to being unfamiliar with the true capabilities of our Navy and Airforce so I shall not comment on them, but leave it to those who are familiar with the doctrine. But I'd like to add that an assault carrier is definitely wishful thinking, given it's vulnerability in our small confined region, it's quite impractical as we have requirements to force-project over extended distances (our KC135s are more than capable for the time being).<br><br>Bear in mind my suggestions are for long term developement and not in the immediate future so budget is not very strained. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy">  I'm a taxpayer too you know.</div>
