            <div class='col-md body'>I feel that Singapore should increase military spending,to protect our interests overseas and build up power projection capability,given these uncertain times.We should play a role commensurate with our status within the region.<br><br>My suggestions are as follows<br><br><strong>RSN</strong>:<br><br>-an extra sqdrn of Delta-class FFGs to provide further AAW,ASW and anti-ship capability to RSN.<br><br>-1 sqdrn of DDGs to project power from Singapore to Andaman Sea and cover the whole of the South China Sea up to the rim of the Pacific Ocean.<br><br>-1 to 2 light carriers,similar to the Spanish navy's current carrier.Perhaps one with a tonnage of 20 000 tons and a capability to hold 30 aircraft,to provide a mobile 2nd strike capability as well as provide power projection to protect overseas Singaporean interests in areas such as the Middle East,the Indian Ocean and the South China Sea.<br><br><strong>RSAF</strong>:<br><br>The RSAF currently has many vital assets baed on the ground,to my current knowledge.We suffer a weakness of being vulnerable to artillery fire from northern sectors.An enemy with artillery or similar assets based in the north makes it a strategic asset for use against RSAF ground based assets.<br><br>While it is known that there are several backup runways throughout the island,with hardened shelters and reinforced runways,it would still remain vulneralbe to bombardment,no matter how hardened.<br><br>Perhaps an investment in STOVL or VTOL assets should be made?This would allow the RSAF to operate out of less friendly ground environments.<br><br>Furthermore,the role of CAS should be investigated.Perhaps getting 'flying tanks' such as the A-10 Warthog would increase the scope of operations that the RSAF could undertake?<br><br>Out of interest,does the Rafale or EF Typhoon have STVOL capability?<br><br><strong>NS</strong>:<br><br>To overcome current manpower constraints,perhaps the conscription of both male and female Singaporeans should be seriously considered,based of the Israeli system of conscription.More males could be deployed in active combat vocations,while females could be deployed in combat support vocations and other vital functions such as logistics,intelligence and Military Police.<br><br>To introduce an adversity quotient in current conscript batches,conditions in training camps such as Pulau Tekong could be made less comfortable,combined with removal of any and all air-conditioning facilities that may be exploited by troops,such as air-con bunks,a total waste of energy.This would cut waste and save funds,allowing it to be diverted to other,more vital areas,as well as contributing to increased physical ruggedness in the troops.Of course,the situation of making situations less comfortable in the barracks is an example.There are many other methods/strategies by which this may be accomplished.<br><br>A second suggestion would be more realistic and intense combat training,such as simulated battlefield conditions,with use of simulant elements such as animal blood and organs(easily bought at cheap prices from the abbatoirs)strewn through areas which troops must access,as well as use of plastic or rubber bullets in training,to desensitise troops and mentally condition them for combat situations.This can be done in a variety of ways.What was states could be used as an example.<br><br>A third suggestions is to increase the physical training standards of the recruits,and extend BMT to a term of 4 months to allow for harsher physical conditioning.Along with this,more discretion could be given to trainers and unit commanders as to the training of their units.Clear safety guidelines could be provided,within which trainers and commanders would operate as best as they saw fit."Siong" training should also be encouraged as it implements mental and physical toughness in recruits.<br><br>It should be kept in mind that at no times do I imply a drop in safety standards and procedures.Medics should be present at all times to ensure the physical welfare of troops.Should mental problems among troops crop up,a camp counselor should be provided,or a trusted CO to report to,though a counselor is the best course.<br><br><strong>Elite units</strong>:<br><br>Elite units refers to those of the Guards,Commandos and NDU.Such units should all have their own style of 'Hell Week',to weed out weaker elements within the troops,though this is preferred for Commandos and NDU,which are actual Special Forces.Guards serve in the role of elite infantry.<br><br>Such units should have the chance of being deployed overseas more often to active or passive combat zones,to 'blood' them and allow combat experience to leak into the officer corps. and enlisted ranks of the SAF.<br><br>Such theatrs of operation I suggest are:Iraq,East Timor,Mindanao and the Balkans where peacekeeping and police duties could be undertaken.<br><br>An unorthodox option would be active deployment in areas such as South African cities or the Brazilian city of Sau Paulo,where the authorities would be glad of a helping military hand in dealing with their crime problems.Such areas are as close to real combat zones as possble,without as many resulting dangers,though still lethal.<br><br>An upgrade in the equipment used by elite units would also be in order,such as providing body armour to Guards for use in even normal operations and day to day usage,in the form of lightweight flak jackets for everyday duties,and full-scale armour similar to that used by American forces in current BUA such as in Iraq as of 2004 for peacekeeping duties.<br><br>(Yo,Mindef personnel,if you do read this,like you said in the Straits Times,at least keep these suggestions in mind.I'm starting my NS january 2005)<br><br>[btw,off topic,I know I asked this a long time ago,but is it possible for me to get into the Commandos if I am an only son?I am very fit and would probably be Pes B+ or Pes A-.My usual NAPFA is Silver,and I work out at least 3-4 times a week in a gym.My eyesight is 250 degrees.Care to comment on my chances?]</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>wow, where u copy one. why is SOF left out of elite unit ? most probably is due to the fact that publications should not make known dat SOF exists although alot of men know it exist. dats why they still say the cdos were the ones who took part in the hijack incident in the 90s. nice try to make it seem u typed all the stuff...<br><br>and....if u think an arti attack would render our RSAF useless....u are very wrong...serve NS to find out why or start reading STs....<br><br>frog in a well....</div>

We don't have enough personnel for that, let alone the cost. Acquiring an aircraft carrier would mean that we would require additional force protection of warships, etc...SAF would go broke in no time. And our defence scope doesn't require us to have an aircraft carrier. Even Thailand has problems maintaining its own helo carrier.<br><br><blockquote><strong>RSAF</strong>:<br><br>The RSAF currently has many vital assets baed on the ground,to my current knowledge.We suffer a weakness of being vulnerable to artillery fire from northern sectors.An enemy with artillery or similar assets based in the north makes it a strategic asset for use against RSAF ground based assets.<br><br>While it is known that there are several backup runways throughout the island,with hardened shelters and reinforced runways,it would still remain vulneralbe to bombardment,no matter how hardened.<br><br>Perhaps an investment in STOVL or VTOL assets should be made?This would allow the RSAF to operate out of less friendly ground environments.<br><br>Furthermore,the role of CAS should be investigated.Perhaps getting 'flying tanks' such as the A-10 Warthog would increase the scope of operations that the RSAF could undertake?<br><br>Out of interest,does the Rafale or EF Typhoon have STVOL capability? </blockquote>That might be good but not necessary. Remember that our defence strategy is based on forward deterrence. Even if we managed to take a few hits on the runway, they can be repaired almost immediately. Our aircraft are under HAS anyway. A VTOL or VSTOL aircraft is good for close air support, but lacks the punch and power required for air-to-air combat...<br><br><blockquote><strong>NS</strong>:<br><br>To overcome current manpower constraints,perhaps the conscription of both male and female Singaporeans should be seriously considered,based of the Israeli system of conscription.More males could be deployed in active combat vocations,while females could be deployed in combat support vocations and other vital functions such as logistics,intelligence and Military Police.</blockquote>Our weapon technology has allowed us to do more with less...the 155 SP Primus is an example. I mean, its not just the military alone. By conscripting females, we will cause labour shortages in the long run. This lone is detrimental to our economy. Remember, Economic defence plays a part too...<br><br><blockquote>To introduce an adversity quotient in current conscript batches,conditions in training camps such as Pulau Tekong could be made less comfortable,combined with removal of any and all air-conditioning facilities that may be exploited by troops,such as air-con bunks,a total waste of energy.This would cut waste and save funds,allowing it to be diverted to other,more vital areas,as well as contributing to increased physical ruggedness in the troops.Of course,the situation of making situations less comfortable in the barracks is an example.There are many other methods/strategies by which this may be accomplished.</blockquote>Boy, recruits are gonna hate you...Do you know that Tekong is actually hotter than mainland S'pore?

I think the citizenry wouldn't take too kindly to the fact that their conscript son(s) is/are deployed in combat zones whether active or passive. Apart from regulars, there is no good reason why S'pore gov't would send NSF for overseas deployment. We are a conscript army first and foremost.

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote>To overcome current manpower constraints,perhaps the conscription of both male and female Singaporeans should be seriously considered,based of the Israeli system of conscription.More males could be deployed in active combat vocations,while females could be deployed in combat support vocations and other vital functions such as logistics,intelligence and Military Police. </blockquote>I'll prefer calling up more permanent residents (PMs) before enlisting women in general. As things currently stand, I believe only the under 21's &amp; locally-schooled PMs get conscripted - &amp; the SAF has benefited from this through the decades. But, calculating/referencing from different sources, the PM population has risen from about 82,000 combined in the 1980 Census to about 138,000 males in the 2000 version - so why not take advantage of that, especially the older twentysomethings? I'm not expecting drastic changes &amp; they'll obviously be hard to be integrated into a military-operational unit as well. But on paper IMHO a lot of these educated PMs can displace the current rear-echelon personnel, which in turn can be freed up to operate some of the modern technology/equipment  (which may not necessarily require combat-fit troops to operate).</div>

While the RSAF has measures to survive a first strike on our airfields, we must take note that a successful strike on our airfields would result in a gap of at least 3-4 hours where they will be inoperative while the craters are filled over. Considering todays cratering munitions have a mix of cratering devices and anti-personnel mines to slow down repair work, it would almost seem certain that 3-4 hours would be an optimistic figure. And in the meantime, we would need something to maintain a certain level of sortie rates for air defence/urgent CAS. So whats the solution?<br><br>The purchase of a carrier, even a small one, for Singapore would not be a wise move. On the military side, it would be a severe strain on our already taxed manning needs. While automation would reduce the crew needs for the ship itself, the airwing would need its specialist-trained crew, something that automation would not solve.<br><br>On the economic front, costs would be prohibitive. Not just the startup, but costs to keep the ship running.<br><br>Fianlly, political considerations. A carrier would throw the entire regional balance out-of-whack and plunge it into some pretty serious unfriendliness between us and our neighbours. It might spark off a whole new arms race and destabilise the area. One could argue Thailand already has a carrier, but I'm talking in the context of the Malay Peninsula/Indonesian archipelago.<br><br>And as someone has pointed out, it would need a small group of escorts to accompany it. More $$, more manning needs. Not practical, nor cost effective.<br><br>As for a STOVL, that I'm in favour of. I've argued about this before, if we were to get F-35s, it would make perfect sense to get at least a squadron of the USMC STOVL version to complement 1 (maybe 2) squadrons of conventional versions. A better solution would be to get all STOVL aircraft, but its not a practical solution as that would really increase costs.</div>

And RSAF's share of the defence budget is probably all used up to buy all those fanciful planes so ADA, the poor cousin, gets peanuts. If you ask me, investing in a good SAM system is more worth it than investing in planes. Not only is it cheaper but its likely to be damn effective. Our likely adversaries sux at SEAD so they can't destroy our fixed defences whereas our fixed defences can destroy them. This may also be a wiser choice given that our offensive edge has been blunted by Malaysia's purchase of newer SAM systems than us e.g. Jernas. RSAF, chuck your Rapiers!

Our only maritime interest is to ensure the security of SLOCs in the Straits of Malacca and the South China Sea. And we can do this with what we have now. With KC-135s, I really dun see the need for carriers to extend our reach. Anyway, the Endurance class LSTs do have the capability to carry a few helicopters.
