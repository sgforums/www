            <div class='col-md body'>In the book 'The Holocaust' by renowned historian Martin Gilbert are quite a few pages devoted to medical experiments particularly by Josef Mengele. In 1943 he was 32 and was consumed by his desire to advance his career by publishing journals from his experiments on living jews.<br><br>He probably killed several thousand by injecting them with such things as petrol, chloroform or air. He had a particular fascination for eye colour and tried changing the colour by injecting them with dye. Another of his fascinations were twins and in one experiment he sewed a pair together and connected their veins, because the wounds became infected and they were screaming in agony their parents managed to get hold of enough morphine to kill them.<br><br>He also used dwarves to pull their teeth out (while still alive) to compare them to normal sized people, I'd imagine they didn't get any 'freeze'.<br><br>Not really an experiment but ISTR a jew being asked to move heavy blocks of ice, fistly wearing gloves but he was then ordered to take them off. After several hours his hands were black with frostbite and they were amputated. A fruitless exercise as he was then shot.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I do not know whether head transplant was possible during WWII, but i do believe that military technology is way ahead of the technology we know. There is a lag time for the military to deem a certain invention as obselete before releasing to the public. Certain stuff that they can do but feel that it will benefit the enemy more then they will not release the know-how. Thus they might have known how to do a head transplant then but doesnt want to teach to the world for fear of misuse. As human cloning has shown, once the information is out, there is no stopping on who can use it no matter how hard u try to stop it.</div>
