Some<br>other air forces have failed to shrug off their bad flight-safety record<br>because their senior officers have not remedied safety hazards like poor pilot<br>training, shoddy aircraft maintenance, improperly scripted standard operational<br>procedures or inadequately maintained airbase infrastructure.<br>The RSAF's improved safety record is commendable in view of its higher<br>operational tempo - which means more intense flying - and the larger fleet of<br>fighters, support aircraft and helicopters in its order of battle.<br>From 1970 to 1979, the RSAF lost 16 pilots from 21 fighter-aircraft crashes.<br>One Hawker Hunter was damaged in a mid-air collision but managed to return to<br>its airbase safely. More than 70 per cent of the crashes in the 1970s were<br>fatal ones.<br>The 10 years between 1990 to 1999 saw nine RSAF personnel (six helicopter<br>pilots and three helicopter aircrewmen) die in three helicopter crashes. No<br>fighter pilot died during this period.<br>From 1990 to 1999, the RSAF lost five choppers, three fighters and three jet<br>trainers. One F-16A fighter, which was badly damaged in a mid-air collision<br>with another F-16A in July 1991, managed to limp back to Paya Lebar Airbase and<br>has been rebuilt.<br>All RSAF deaths that occurred from 1990 to 1999 involved Super Puma<br>transport helicopters. These carry two pilots and at least one aircrewman in<br>the passenger compartment.<br>Catastrophic helicopter crashes are less survivable than accidents involving<br>aircraft equipped with ejection seats because chopper crews cannot bail out of<br>their stricken machines.<br>The fact that there is a 16-year gap between the previous death of an RSAF<br>fighter pilot and last month's fatal crash involving Lieutenant Brandon Loo<br>Kwang Han, 25, underscores the part that safety devices like ejection seats<br>have played in saving aircrew lives.<br>The last fatal crash involving an RSAF fighter pilot took place on May 24,<br>1988, in the Philippines. In that incident, a 23-year-old pilot ejected from a<br>Hawker Hunter just outside Clark Airbase. He was picked up by a United States<br>Air Force rescue chopper but died from his injuries.<br>Unlike ejection seats used today, which can safely extract a pilot even if<br>his aircraft is stationary on the ground, a Hunter pilot needed to achieve a<br>minimum height and airspeed for his parachute to open safely. The pilot<br>involved in the Clark Airbase crash was barely at the safety threshold, so his<br>injuries were severe.<br>Between that crash and the death of Lt Loo after his fighter crashed on May<br>19 during a night-training flight in the Arizona desert, 10 RSAF fixed-wing<br>aircraft have crashed but their pilots all survived.<br>Several other aircraft were involved in minor incidents, like veering off<br>runways, but no serious injuries to pilots were reported.<br>Such news may be cold comfort to the family, friends and colleagues of Lt<br>Loo, whose ashes were placed in their final resting place yesterday afternoon<br>at Foo Hai Ch'an Monastery.<br>While we mourn his loss, Singaporeans can take heart that the RSAF has built<br>up a robust safety-management apparatus that will get to the bottom of the<br>tragic crash and ensure that lessons learnt are disseminated in a proper and<br>timely manner.<br>The formation of the RSAF Flight Test Centre means the air force can work<br>with the defence industry and defence science community to test and install<br>devices to make RSAF aircraft safer.<br>These run the gamut from ejection seats and parachutes, to devices that can<br>launch decoys to protect aircraft against anti-aircraft missiles, thereby<br>boosting the aircraft's operational safety.<br>Airbase infrastructure has improved significantly since the 1970s. The<br>decision to build Changi East Airbase and the runway on Pulau Sudong means RSAF<br>pilots have alternative landing strips should emergencies arise.<br>These airstrips are a vital safety feature as flight paths leading to Paya<br>Lebar Airbase and Tengah Airbase take aircraft over densely populated areas.<br>One can appreciate the enormity of the task the RSAF faces in managing<br>safety when one considers that the RSAF is one of the few air forces in the<br>world where the sun never sets on its flight-training regime.<br>This is because the RSAF maintains detachments in places as far flung as<br>Australia, Brunei, France and the United States. So its training management<br>philosophy must operate not only round the clock, but also round the globe in<br>different climates and flying conditions.<br>The RSAF cannot hope for a zero-accident rate. The only way for any air<br>force to achieve a zero-accident rate is for it to keep its warplanes grounded.<br>That being an impractical measure, the RSAF must continue to work to manage<br>the consequences of air accidents by doing all it can to make such mishaps<br>survivable.<br>Warplanes can always be replaced, but pilots and aircrew are irreplaceable.<br><br>- Ends -</div>
