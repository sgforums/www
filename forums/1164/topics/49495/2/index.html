            <div class='col-md body'>hmm.....the most interesting thing i know is the fact that the RSN ship turned to PORT and not starboard....it's basic sea laws to turn starboard when you're head on with another ship....either that or the windward ship has to give way to leeward ship....but it doesnt matter as both those ships have no sails.....<br>Overall i agree with most of you people.....why are the junior officers the only one's being charged?Where were the senior officers?!?!i mean those 2 guys were pretty young to be entrusted the whole ship too!!That said i have a friend who was on that ship at that time and he is not saying anything so i guess they were told to keep quiet.... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"></div>

COLLISON??? hahahhaha that was what our media said! but do you know that on that day... its was a mission/EX that require commando and us to have a silent transit through that area? why the news never mention about this??? why they never mention that we are all in that little sea boat and NO NAKE LIGHT IS ALLOW? dont u think that its again the ROR as well?? and the best part is.... we dont even have any PC or APC to guide us! just navigate on our nake eye!!! sigh sigh sigh...</strong><br><br>To answer your question ... no ... i dunno whether the AO is the only one on watch at that time<br>and neither do you have the rite to judge the decision of the OOW at that time.(nonethless its against the ROR)<br><br><strong>but thats what always happen in Navy... AO on watch was not something new! i've attach on most of the ship and when i'm a CPL an Sgt.... i was even asked to help up in the look out! <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"> imagin a trip to Australia... how many time must we perform as a look out on the wheel house? we all know that we are not train on that! but the chief PO will always request us to perform look out duty! <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"> i have even keep watch with AO before.... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"> be it onboard LST, MCV or APV.... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"> </strong><br><br>Sometimes, we infringe the ROR because we need to avoid collision, u think its fun to infringe the ROR ?

            <div class='col-md body'>I thought the reason why the ship turn to port is because the officers wanted to maintain a close distance frorm Pedra Branca.<br><br>Their mission was to "guard" Pedra Branca.
