            <div class='col-md body'>The SAF operates on the basis of responsibility. Everything is someone's responsibility. If it screws up, there is automatically someone to blame. I am not in the Navy, but I am quite sure it applies there too.<br><br>As I understand it, when the ship is underway, the ship's navigation is the responsibility of the Officer of the Watch. If the ship's navigation is bad, it is that person's fault, regardless of how it happened. In this case, the Officer of the Watch was overseeing a trainee, who was the one that actually issued the incorrect orders. Nevertheless, it is not the trainee's fault, but the OOW's (sp?) since it is his responsibility and he must do everything in his power to ENSURE (favorite SAF term) that it is done correctly. He did not.<br><br>Now, the Officer of the Watch was surely trained by senior officers, received his orders from senior officers, etc. His decisions were in turn carried out by junior officers and affected by their performance. So everyone on the ship "caused" the incident. Is it everybody's fault now, since everybody contributed to it? No. It is the Officer of the Watch's responsibility. There is no "victim culture" in the SAF. You cannot stand up and claim you screwed up because this person did that and that person did this. Your responsibility, your failure to ensure, your backside gets torn.<br><br>The trainee is only responsible for her training. At the worst, she can be found to have been insufficiently diligent in her midshipman studies and failed out of the course. She did not work hard enough to learn the right way to navigate. Her lack of diligence is her fault and she should be appropriately punished for that. But the loss of the ship is not her fault, and the punishment should fall on her overseer.<br><br>Of course, this is all unfortunately only theory. Things do not always follow the official model. We will see in this case. They should be doing things by the book since the case is so high-profile, but I would not be surprised if they were skipping some pages for one reason or another.</div>

I think there is no doubt they violated international maritime laws, and I don't believe they can claim ignorance about the laws of the sea.<br><br>But then, maybe the RSN has to review its training procedures of its officers and helmsmen and be tougher in enforcing compliance with these laws among its junior officers, especially with regards to safe seamanship in the narrow and congested waters around Singapore. If this has been found grossly wanting among its senior officers, I've no doubt that they should be disciplined as well, though charging the might be a bit over the top.<br><br>I've had several people (who used to go sea fishing in the waters around Pedra Branca) tell me that the worst offenders of these written and unwritten maritime laws in the area are the RSN and PCG boats. So I guess the Courageous accident and its aftermath wasn't that big a surprise to me after the stories I've heard.</div>
