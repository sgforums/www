              <p>With your noisy pussy's ability - you should help smoothen diplomatic ties between MAF and the SAF.</p>
              <p>Why do you not attempt to convince them that it is in our common interest to share common equipment, perhaps we could share - the "truck technology" that is  used in the ST Terrex 8x8 - in some simple joint-venture basis for a start ?</p>
              <p>They can plug in all the other more "sensitive equipment" that they wish to have for their MAF, while the ST developed weapon systems can be kept confidential.</p>

              <p>With this Little Red Dot in the middle of a rough neighborhood that indulge in rivalries in one form or antoher, the old adage that "<em>the</em> <em>enemy of my enemy is my friend</em>" - will still hold true</p>
              <p>There is nothing to guarantee that the ST equipment sold to the Indonesians will not be turned against us - not when the community leaders that are elected into the National Assembly are fickle and unprincipled, and when the people that elect them are similarly as volatile and as fickled when blind nationalism takes grip.</p>
              <p>Should we let petty concern - that someone will claim the product to be their design - to prevent an investment that leads to longer term benefits and new opportunities ?</p>
              <p>Claiming a product to be of one's design is not unfamiliar with Singapore, when we are also skilled in making such claims ourselves - which started with the AR-15 that was no more then the outright purchase of a design that no one else was interested.</p>
              <p>ST had even claimed the Swedish 'Visby' Stealth Corvette to be a local design, and had even proudly displayed it as a center piece at a local Defense Exhibtion - at a time before the decision was made in favor of the <em>La Fayette</em> Class from DCN.</p>
              <p>In any case, the Terrex is not even a local design, as it was an original development by Timoney Technologies from UK that got ST interested to enter into a J V for the potential requirements of the SAF and for exports.</p>
              <p>The same Terrex is known as the "Yavuz" in the Turkish variant that is manufactured under license in Turkey in a separate J.V. with ST Kinetics.</p>

              <p>With a new leadership in PM Najib Razak, it will bring a generation change in leadership to complete a full circle in both countries; and such a venture will open the doors to many more opportunities that will benefit both sides of the Causeway.</p>

              <div style="text-align: justify;">The Infantry has a new addition to its arsenal - introducing the versatile, cutting-edge 8 x 8 wheeled Terrex Infantry Carrier Vehicle (ICV). This locally designed armoured vehicle was officially rolled out and unveiled by Chief of Army, MG Neo Kian Hong on 21 August at the 5th Anniversary of 9th Singapore Division/HQ Infantry (9 DIV/INF) at Selarang Camp. On 3 September, it was launched by Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Defence Teo Chee Hean at the Army Open House.</div>

              <div style="text-align: justify;">The Terrex ICV will contribute to the potency of our 3rd Generation fighting force. At the roll-out ceremony, COL Lim Hock Yu, Commander of 9 DIV/INF explained, "The Terrex ICV will allow the Infantry to operationalise the new Infantry fighting capabilities to meet the challenges in the future complex operational environment. It will enable our Infantry forces to fight as a mobile, networked force and be a potent and highly survivable force in the 3rd Generation Army."</div>
