            <div class='col-md body'><strong><a href="http://www.janes.com/" rel="nofollow">Spike-ER + Tiger = deadly accuracy</a></strong><br><br><blockquote>Spike-ER + Tiger = deadly accuracy<br>Brian M Walters<br><br>Spike-ER + Tiger = deadly accuracy<br><br>Seen mounted on the Eurocopter Tiger on the EADS outside display, the Rafael Spike-ER missile has been cleared for use by the attack helicopter. This follows the successful conclusion of firing trials in Spain last month, when each of four missiles launched hit their targets with remarkable precision.<br><br>Although the operator had only experienced Â‘useÂ’ of the weapon by means of the HeliCoat simulator, such precision can be easily achieved because the Spike-ERÂ’s guidance system comprises day and night vision cameras that enable crews to Â‘rideÂ’ the missile to the point of impact. The pilot can launch a missile and then mask down out of sight of the target while following the image using a fibre-optic communication link.<br><br>During the flight, the pilot can update the aimpoint or even switch targets if a more important alternative comes into view. A video of the trials in Spain, which may be seen on RafaelÂ’s stand (E38/2) demonstrates the ease with which novice operators can hit their targets, but visitors to the companyÂ’s stand can try their hand at hitting a tank, or a terrorist operating a machine gun from a small truck.<br><br>Perhaps the most astonishing demonstration of accuracy using the HeliCoat simulator shows a particular window on a designated floor being penetrated by a Spike-ER, which was launched before the building came clearly into view. With the helicopter out of sight and hearing from a distance of 8km, the elevated view from the missileÂ’s seeker gradually revealed the point designated by intelligence as the location of a terrorist.<br><br>The importance of avoiding collateral damage when targeting an enemy points to the value of using a weapon such as Spike-ER, since the operator has the target in view throughout the engagement, so that even if it moves out of sight, the missile can be guided to open ground.<br><br>Spike-ER is in service with IDF forces and the Finnish Coastguard, but for attack helicopter operators, the weapon offers important advantages in addition to its accuracy; at 33kg, it weighs less than other missiles in its category that weigh some 50kg. Moreover, no black boxes need be fitted to the attack helicopter, as the electrical interface and gas cooling system are integrated in the launcher that attaches to the hard point.<br><br>Spike-ER is also in service with Romanian forces, where it is carried by Puma helicopters, but both France and Spain are showing strong interest in arming their Tigers with the missile, so they will be particularly interested in the success of the firing trials in May. Germany, another Tiger customer, is also believed to be interested in arming the helicopter with Spike-ER.</blockquote><img src="http://eurosatory.janes.com/docs/eurosatory2006/sections/moxiepix/a313.jpg"><br><br>2.<strong><a href="http://www.stengg.com/investorelations/pdf/transformbetteralignment.pdf" rel="nofollow">Spore<br>Technology involved  products</a></strong>---see p8.<br><br><strong><a href="http://jczs.news.sina.com.cn/2006-06-20/0819378248.html" rel="nofollow">more in Chinese</a></strong><br><br>3.Afier Finland (home of Nokia) and Poland,<strong><a href="http://eurosatory.janes.com/docs/eurosatory/articles/jmr060324_1_n.shtml" rel="nofollow">Czech Army plans to deploy Spike on Pandur II<br><br></a></strong><br><br><blockquote><br>By Michal Zdobinsky<br><br>In late January 2006 the Czech government approved the purchase of up to 234 Steyr-Daimler-Puch Pandur II 8x8 armoured personnel carriers. A proportion of these will be equipped with launchers for the Spike-LR anti-tank missile system.<br><br>A final agreement due to be concluded in April will cover 199 Pandur IIs plus an option for 35 further vehicles. The contract will be worth CZK23.6 billion (USD1.02 billion) and includes the armament.<br><br>The Czech Army chose the Rafael Remote Controlled Weapon Station (RCWS). The unsuccessful contenders were Oto Melara with its Hitfist 30 turret and Rheinmetall, which offered the E9 turret but supplied the Czechs with the older and heavier E4 turret for trials. All three turrets were armed with Spike.</blockquote>4.Guys,sg's products not bad.more and more foreign countries<br>are using them.Dunt look down or look up our products,unnecessarily.<br><br>5.<strong><a href="http://www.eurospike.com/family.html" rel="nofollow">what manufacture says</a></strong><br><img src="http://www.eurospike.com/pics/missile1.jpg"><br><br><strong><a href="http://israeli-weapons.com/weapons/missile_systems/anti-armor/gill_spike/GillSpike.html" rel="nofollow">Gill/Spike</a></strong><br><br><img src="http://israeli-weapons.com/weapons/missile_systems/anti-armor/gill_spike/spike_lr2.jpg"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>That will be good to have but not necessary. This is because, our armoured forces will be covered by the AH-64D Longbow Apaches. Further more we have the AMX-13 SM1's replacement on the way which will provide some anti-tank capability for the ABG. We also have the MBTs, the upgraded Centurions(assuming we have them)<br><br>But it will be a good idea to have a pod with two Hellfire or Spike missiles for the 25mm armed BX, much like the 2 TOW missiles on the Bradley. It is not necessary for all BX to be equipped with ATGM just one in each AI platoon will do.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"></div>
