              Hello all. I would like to know how I can get PES F for my upcoming medical checkup.
              
              Mental:
              I'll first start off by saying that I am slightly autistic. I have OCD and I have anger management issues. Since young from primary school, I have asked and got exempted from PE because I find it dirty and irrelevant to my studies. Meaning, I have not experienced any form of exercise since young. I have not done any NAFA test, pushups, situps etc. For the past 10 over years I have been seeing a psychologist annually at an autism clinic. I have taken courses offered by the clinic to address my mental health and I was once almost sent to IMH because I almost killed my sister with a kitchen knife.
              
              Physical:
              If you look at me at first glance, you would have easily mistaken me for some primary/lower sec school boy and would have thought I was innocent, kind etc. But don't be fooled by my appearance as it did to the many people who have met me. At just 1.55m tall and 34kg, I have a BMI of 14.2. Now you're probably wondering what my age is right? I'm 20. Though I am extremely skinny, I do have a strong immune system and rarely get sick.
              
              Now that you have read my story, I would like to know how I can get exempted from NS.
              I do know for a fact that if you are very skinny, they will not allow you to serve. So what is that magic BMI number to get PES F? And what else can I say to achieve that PES?
              
              Btw, I intend to migrate in the future so no need to tell me how PES F will be a disadvantage to me in getting a job.

              fitness condition for NS.<br> <br> You <em><span style="text-decoration: underline;">MUST</span></em> bring along all your investigation results and memorandums from
              your external physician or specialist during your medical review.
              You may be given a medical certificate for ICT deferment, be
              scheduled for a medical board to downgrade you if your medical
              condition is significant, or be referred to a restructured hospital
              for further examination depending on the outcome of your medical
              review.<br> <br> If your medical condition is deemed suited for ICT participation by

              <p>Because NS life is different from civilian life before
              enlistment, there are many adjustments you need to make.</p>
              <p>A good way to cope is to get support from your buddy and fellow
              recruits. They are going through the same tough training as you, so
              talking to one another will help relieve some tension.</p>
              <p>In most evenings during your leisure time, you’ll also have some
              time to call your family or loved ones to talk. They can give you
              emotional support during NS.</p>
              <p>You can have a one-on-one interview sessions with your officer
              to highlight any problems you may have. If you have a personal or
              family problem that need to be addressed, do let the officer
              know—he may be able to give you some advice or time off to settle
              your problems.</p>

              medical consultation, you may have to return for repeat medical
              appointments, after more information becomes available (e.g. after
              a latest specialist report is obtained from your
              hospital). </span></strong></p>

              <p>A <strong>Medical Board</strong> is a session conducted to evaluate the medical
              condition of a serviceman and to:<br> a. review his PES grade;<br> b. recommend a change of vocation or restriction of duties on
              medical grounds;<br> c. endorse his extended-period medical certificate; or<br> d. determine permanent disability if he has sustained
              service-related injuries.<br> <br> <strong>A serviceman is required to undergo a Medical Review prior
              to a Medical Board.</strong> This allows the unit Medical Officer
              to gather sufficient information (e.g. specialist medical reports,
              investigation results) so that <strong>the Medical Board can make a
              decision on the PES grade.</strong> Depending on the complexity of
              your condition, more than one review may be required.<br> <br> Medical Boards cannot be booked using the eMedAppt module. Medical
              Board appointments can only be made by a Medical Officer when your
              medical information is complete and all investigation results are
              back.<br> <br> You have the option to either be present or absent at your
              medical board. For your convenience and in clear-cut cases, your
              Medical Officer may give you the option of not being present for
              your medical board (i.e. having a Board in Absentia). You can
              however still choose to be present during your Medical Board in
              such cases. However, for complicated cases, you are required to be
              present during your medical board (i.e. Board in
              Presence).</p>

              <p>Medical screening is a series of medical tests done at the
              Medical Classification Centre (MCC) at <abbr title="Central Manpower Base">CMPB</abbr> (<a rel="nofollow" href="http://iprep.ns.sg/img/cmpb-map.png">location map</a>).</p>
              <p>The objective of these tests is to ascertain your medical
              condition and accord you a suitable Physical Employment Status
              (PES). Based on your PES, you will be assigned to a suitable
              vocation.</p>
              <p>Here are the various PES gradings:</p>
              <ul>
              <li><strong>PES A</strong>: Fit for all combat vocations</li>
              <li><strong>PES B1</strong>: Fit for most combat vocations</li>
              <li><strong>PES B2</strong>: Fit for some combat vocations</li>
              <li><strong>PES BP</strong>: Fit for obese <abbr title="Basic Military Training">BMT</abbr> training</li>
              <li><strong>PES C</strong>: Fit for combat support vocations</li>
              <li><strong>PES D</strong>: Temporary unfit for grading and pending
              further review</li>
              <li><strong>PES E</strong>: Fit for administrative duties only</li>
              <li><strong>PES F</strong>: Medically unfit for any form of
              service</li>
              </ul>
              <p>Note that if you are given a <abbr title="Physical Employment Status">PES</abbr> D grading, it means that
              more time/tests are required to confirm your medical condition.
              This normally takes about 2-3 months. However, this duration may be
              longer depending on your medical condition.</p>

              <p><em><strong>Being psychologically prepared is all about knowing
              what to expect and being prepared for it.</strong></em></p>
              <p>To be better prepared, you can participate in Total Defence
              activities and Open Houses organised by the SAF/SPF/SCDF.</p>
              <p>Perhaps you should also talk to your family members and friends
              who have lived the NS experience. The more you discuss with others,
              the more comfortable and mentally prepared you’ll become.</p>
              <p><strong>Because NS life is different from civilian life before
              enlistment, there are many adjustments you need to
              make.</strong></p>
              <p>A good way to cope is to get support from your buddy and fellow
              recruits. They are going through the same tough training as you, so
              talking to one another will help relieve some tension.</p>
              <p>In most evenings during your leisure time, you’ll also have some
              time to call your family or loved ones to talk. They can give you
              emotional support during NS.</p>
              <p>You can have a one-on-one interview sessions with your officer
              to highlight any problems you may have. If you have a personal or
              family problem that need to be addressed, do let the officer
              know—he may be able to give you some advice or time off to settle
              your problems.</p>
              <p>Life in NS revolves around structure, routine and discipline.
              This helps us stay united as a uniformed organisation as well as
              imparts the rigours necessary to protect our nation and
              citizens.</p>
              <p>This does not mean there is just work and no play. In fact,
              after a few weeks in NS and you’ll find new friends and new reasons
              to smile!</p>
              <p><strong>As a soldier, one of the biggest adjustments you’ll have
              to make quickly is in regimentation and discipline.</strong></p>
              <p>Being in a uniformed organisation, you’ll have to obey orders
              from your superiors. Thus some of you may feel a sudden lack of
              freedom to do what you want and you may find yourself having
              difficulties accepting authority initially.</p>
              <p>Regimentation and discipline build strong character and
              toughness, so that you’ll be tough enough to handle difficult
              combat, crime-fighting or rescue situations without giving up or
              breaking down.</p>
              <p>When you first enlist into NS, you may have concerns of being in
              a new territory, with new faces and new things to do. But don’t let
              this get to you. Just remember the saying that “when the going gets
              tough, the tough gets going”.</p>
              <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><em>Following are some
              tips on what you can do to prepare yourself
              psychologically:</em></span></p>
              <ul>
              <li>Adopt a positive perception</li>
              <li>Build up physical stamina</li>
              <li>Develop good working attitude and habits</li>
              <li>Overcome psychological stress</li>
              <li>Adopt teamwork spirit</li>
              <li>Learn to be independent</li>
              <li>Set realistic expectations</li>
              </ul>
              <p>You can also speak to your friends or family members who have
              been through NS. Ask them to share their stories. The sharing will
              help you reduce some of your fears, uncertainties and doubts.</p>
              <p><strong>During NS you’ll be living with different
              people.</strong></p>
              <p>Because these people come from different backgrounds, they may
              not think like you do or react to situations like you would.
              Instead of trying to select your type of people, you should cherish
              the diversity. This is a chance for you to learn more about your
              fellow mates and their cultures.</p>
              <p>You’ll find that you have many opportunities to absorb the
              different cultures—during training, eating, chatting or just seeing
              and listening. Take these opportunities and learn from people
              around you, you’ll have a much better appreciation of Singapore’s
              cultural diversity.</p>

              <p>The Institute of Mental Health (IMH) is a 2,000-bed acute
                  tertiary psychiatric hospital situated on a 25-hectare
                  campus at Buangkok Green Medical Park. Set amidst serene
                  surroundings, IMH offers a comprehensive range of psychiatric,
                  rehabilitative and counselling services for children, adolescents,
                  adults, and the elderly.</p>
              <p>IMH’s tradition of care started in 1928. We were the first
                  mental hospital in Singapore, starting with some 1,000 patients.
                  Since then, many advances have been made in treatment, training,
                  and research. Our treatment integrates evidence-based therapies,
                  supported by the departments of clinical psychology, nursing,
                  occupational therapy, and medical social work, to provide holistic
                  care for our patients. IMH is equipped with modern facilities, with
                  50 wards for inpatients and seven Specialist Outpatient
                  Clinics.</p>
              <p>IMH was the first mental health institution in Asia to receive
                  the Joint Commission International Accreditation in 2005, a highly
                  coveted international accreditation for healthcare
                  organisations. </p>
              <p>Over the years, IMH has gained a reputation for quality
                  research. In 2008, the Ministry of Health,
                  Singapore, entrusted IMH with a S$25 million research
                  grant to implement translational and clinical research into the
                  causes of schizophrenia and related psychotic disorders.</p>
              <p>IMH also plays a key role in training the next generation of
                  mental health professionals in Singapore. We train psychiatrists
                  and mental health professionals through the NHG-AHPL Residency
                  Programme for psychiatry and through collaborations with the local
                  tertiary institutions.</p>

              <p>SINGAPORE'S Institute of Mental Health (IMH) beat over 80
              hospitals in Asia to snag the top accolade at the Asia Hospital
              Management Awards (AHMA) last night.</p>
              <p>The hospital won the inaugural Grand Award for the Hospital of
              the Year, because of its good showing in six out of nine other
              award categories.</p>
              <p>The awards were held as part of the Hospital Management Asia
              2011 conference.</p>
              <p><img src="http://my.effectivemeasure.net/emnb_18_4564.gif?14473151" alt="" width="1" height="1"></p>
              <p>Dr Ashok Nath, chairman of Hospital Management Asia, said that
              the Grand Award was created to "encourage hospitals to excel in not
              just one award category, but to also strive for more wins".</p>
              <p>The AHMA, held yesterday at the Resorts World Convention Centre,
              is in its 10th year. The judges include representatives from Johns
              Hopkins Medicine International and the International Hospital
              Federation.</p>
              <p>Dr Chua Hong Choon, IMH's chief executive, said the hospital was
              honoured to win the Grand Award and that the win "gives us the
              affirmation that our programmes are evaluated by international
              consultants to be of best-practices standards".</p>
              <p>The hospital also won the Most Outstanding Project in the
              Service Improvement for Internal Customers Project category for its
              Case Management Service, a follow-up service for discharged
              patients.</p>
              <p>It was started in 2003 but was tweaked last year to include an
              information-technology system that supports the follow-up care
              process.</p>
              <p>Under the service, patients of IMH are assigned a case manager
              who makes sure that they continue to receive care after they are
              discharged. Case managers also often double as confidants for their
              patients.</p>
              <p>Said Joe (not his real name), 34, an IMH patient who was
              diagnosed with bipolar disorder in 2003: "When I have a lot of
              problems on hand and no one to talk to, that tends to increase my
              stress levels. As my condition is easily aggravated by stress, that
              triggers a relapse, causing me to check in and out of the
              hospital."</p>
              <p>However, Joe's condition improved after he was assigned a case
              manager in December 2009. He spends time talking to her every time
              he goes for a medical checkup, and she counsels him on some of the
              problems that he faces.</p>
              <p>Other patients were also found to have fewer relapses and
              re-admissions, after having a case manager assigned to them.</p>
              <p>Between January last year and May this year, IMH saw an
              improvement in patients' compliance with follow-up treatment, from
              78 to 88 per cent, partly due to the improved Case Management
              Service.</p>
              <p>There was also a fall in re-admission rates and the number of
              patients not completing their treatment.</p>
              <p>IMH also received two excellence awards in the Operational
              Customer Service Project, and Marketing, PR or Promotional Project
              categories for its Mental Health - General Practitioner Partnership
              Programme.</p>
              <p>The programme aims to improve access to mental- health care,
              especially in the heartland, by providing general practitioners
              with psychiatric knowledge.</p>

              <div>Minister of State for Health Dr Amy Khor announced in
              Parliament on Monday two new community-based mental health

              healthcare.</div>
              <div><br></div>
              <div>"We are developing Assessment and Shared Care Teams (ASCAT),
              which are specialist-led mental health teams based in the
              community, in order to improve access to mental health care. We are
              also developing Community Mental Health Intervention Teams (COMIT)

              <div>Dr Khor also said that the Institute of Mental Health's (IMH)
              occupancy rate for the past three years averaged at about 80 per
              cent and that the hospital has sufficient capacity for new
              patients.</div>
              <div><br></div>
              <div>There are currently about 2,000 beds across public hospitals

              <div>Responding to queries from Member of Parliament Mr Hri Kumar

              together, the sum of our collective efforts is larger than what we
              could each do on our own," Mr Teo said. "It is important to
              encourage people to seek help early through education, and to
              reduce discrimination against those with mental
              illness."</span></p>

              people in 2012. The facility opened in October 2011. Some 460 youth

              <p>Signs of psychological trouble</p>
              <p>WHAT are some of the signs that your child may be suffering from
              psychological problems? Psychiatrists point to some of the things
              that you could look out for:</p>
              <p>    Sleep or appetite problems</p>
              <p>    Behaviour and speech that seem out of
              character</p>
              <p>    Difficulty concentrating or a lack of
              motivation</p>
              <p>    A drop in academic performance</p>
              <p>    Becoming increasingly withdrawn from families and
              peers, preferring to keep to oneself at home</p>
              <p>    Becoming argumentative towards family and
              friends</p>
              <p>    Hallucinations, delusional beliefs, odd or
              impulsive behaviour and even suicidal tendencies.</p>
              <p>If there has been a recent crisis such as the loss of a loved
              one, a divorce or school stress, be sure to check on how the child
              is coping. Take note of how he is performing in school and how he
              is interacting with others. </p>

              </div>
              </div>
              <p>Story by Benita Teo</p>
              <p><strong>Serving in the military is certainly no mean feat. And
                  when the security of the nation is in one’s hands, mental strength
                  is as important as, if not more so than, physical
                  fitness.</strong><br> <br> When the going gets tough, it is often helpful to talk it out with
                  a trusted family or friend. But, even with the best of intentions,
                  not everyone is able to fully comprehend the intricacies of
                  military life.<br> <br> To help the servicemen and women of the Singapore Armed Forces
                  (SAF) cope with the challenges of their military roles, the
                  counsellors of the SAF Counselling Centre (SCC) are always ready to
                  lend a listening ear. In fact, the team at SCC provides
                  professional counselling services not only to all members of the
                  Ministry of Defence (MINDEF) and SAF, but also to their
                  families.<br> <br> <strong>Learning to live the military life</strong><br> <br> Unlike civilian counselling centres, the SCC comes under military
                  mandate, and its primary purpose is to provide mental health care
                  to ensure that servicemen are able to carry out their duties
                  efficiently.<br> <br> Of the types of cases the SCC sees, Mrs Marlene Koh, Head of
                  Education and Prevention Services, noted that the majority were
                  Full-time National Servicemen (NSFs) with adaptation issues. "Not
                  everybody is used to dealing with authority. They all came in as
                  students who only had to take care of their own studies."<br> <br> She added: "The second, smaller group would be Regulars with career
                  or family issues. A third group comprises families and soldiers
                  affected by critical incidents that happened around them, for
                  instance training incidents or a death in the family."<br> <br> Servicemen in distress may seek help directly with the SCC through
                  two channels: face-to-face sessions or the 24-hour SAF Counselling
                  Hotline. On top of these, a Family Support Helpline is also
                  available for the family members of soldiers deployed overseas who
                  are in need of assistance.<br> <br> <strong>Eyes and ears on the ground</strong><br> <br> To help junior and senior commanders to identify and assist men
                  under their charge who are at risk of emotional distress, the SCC
                  conducts regular workshops. In addition to basic counselling
                  skills, stress management and suicide prevention are also taught at
                  the workshops.<br> <br> Ms Cheryl Chia, an SCC counsellor with 14 years of experience,
                  explained that equipping commanders with these skills is essential
                  because "they are the eyes and ears on the ground".<br> <br> Another set of eyes that the SCC relies on to spot at-risk
                  servicemen are the paracounsellors - Regulars who volunteer to help
                  look after the mental welfare of servicemen at the unit level. To
                  be appointed as paracounsellors, they have to go through a five-day
                  course organised by the SCC that teaches basic counselling, suicide
                  prevention and crisis management skills.<br> <br> Military Expert (ME) 3-3 Sulinder Singh, a Logistics Warrant
                  Officer, has been a paracounsellor in his unit, 201 Squadron (SQN),
                  since 2010. And being a familiar face in the unit means that
                  servicemen know what to expect when they confide in him -
                  trustworthiness.<br> <br> "I'm quite approachable, and they know that if they talk to me, it
                  will be confidential."<br> <br> <strong>Allaying fears</strong><br> <br> Besides assuaging doubts over client confidentiality, the
                  counsellors and paracounsellors also dispelled the stigma of
                  seeking help.<br> <br> "(For) those who are in a position of command, it may be a 'face'
                  issue," said SCC counsellor Lawrence Yap. "But so far, I've not
                  encountered any clients (Regulars) who claimed that attending
                  counselling affected their careers."<br> <br> ME3-3 Singh echoed his sentiments: "Is there a stigma attached to
                  people in the unit who see paracounsellors? No, not at all. They
                  are not mentally ill, we just need to help them find the right way
                  to organise their thoughts."<br> <br> <strong>The counsellor is in</strong><br> <br> Help for a distressed soldier often begins with a visit to the
                  Medical Officer (MO) with complaints of symptoms of stress. Said Ms
                  Chia: "Usually they will say that they are unable to sleep or eat.
                  When the MOs probe deeper and realise that the problem goes beyond
                  a medical issue, they will refer them to us."<br> <br> At the SCC, the soldier will be assigned a counsellor. Through the
                  sessions, counsellor and soldier will work together to identify the
                  problems and set goals towards overcoming them. The counsellor will
                  also impart skills such as stress or anger management
                  techniques.<br> <br> When facing mental turmoil, a soldier may despair and lose his
                  sense of self. One approach a counsellor may take is to remind him
                  of his capabilities.<br> <br> "Counselling is about instilling a sense of hope," said Mr Yap, who
                  specialises in substance and drug addiction counselling. "Everyone
                  has it in them to overcome a difficult situation. We just need to
                  help them see that they are not as helpless as they think they are,
                  and that the situation is not as hopeless as they think it
                  is."<br> <br> SCC counsellors also work with psychiatrists and psychologists from
                  the Psychological Care Centre (PCC) at the SAF Medical Corps'
                  Military Medicine Institute to provide all-round care to the
                  soldier. PCC psychiatrists prescribe medication for conditions like
                  depression while psychologists run tests to ascertain if a
                  behavioural problem is linked to a learning or intellectual
                  disability.<br> <br> <strong>Helping others help themselves</strong><br> <br> With the ever-evolving social landscape, counsellors must stay
                  up-to-date on new behavioural problems or addictions, such as
                  social media addiction.<br> <br> Mrs Koh also pointed out that there are now more cases of
                  servicemen suffering anxieties about not performing well or meeting
                  expectations, and that many expected others to solve their
                  problems.<br> <br> Mr Yap agreed: "To change, clients have to take personal
                  responsibility for their actions."<br> <br> Nonetheless, the counsellors take comfort in the knowledge that
                  they are changing lives for the better.<br> <br> Mrs Koh remembered a recruit who had attempted suicide after his
                  girlfriend of four years ended their relationship and started
                  seeing a friend of his behind his back. Mrs Koh helped him
                  acknowledge his feelings of hurt and disappointment, and taught him
                  constructive ways of managing his anger.<br> <br> The recruit started to improve his relationship with his family and
                  make new friends in his unit. Nine months later, he was finally
                  able to move on from the break-up.<br> <br> Ms Chia also recounted a recent case: "I had a client who wanted to
                  kill himself. But after working with his unit and the psychiatrist,
                  just before his ORD (Operationally Ready Date) he said, 'You gave
                  me hope. Even though life ahead will be challenging, at least I
                  know now that there are people who care, and that there is more to
                  life than thinking about hurting myself.'"<br> <br> She added: "He even baked us cupcakes as a 'thank you'. It's the
                  little things like these (that let me know I’ve made a
                  difference)."</p>

              <p>More can be done to monitor and support national servicemen with
              mental health issues, according to two experts who used to work
              with the Singapore Armed Forces (SAF).</p>
              <p>These include fighting the stigma attached to such illnesses,
              raising awareness about mental health and having more in-camp
              psychiatrists.</p>
              <p>Earlier this week, State Coroner Imran Abdul Hamid delivered his
              findings on the death of Private Ganesh Pillay Magindren, who was
              found at the foot of his Sengkang condominium last July.</p>
              <p>The 23-year-old had been diagnosed with schizophrenia, which
              distorts a person’s thoughts and emotions, causing him to lose
              touch with reality.</p>

              <p>Handling a mentally ill soldier is not easy. They require proper
              attention and a suitable working environment for them to thrive,
              said psychiatrists contacted by The New Paper. For this to happen,
              the Singapore Armed Forces (SAF) has to take ownership of its
              soldiers, Dr Ang Yong Guan said. <br> <br> Dr Ang, who is in private practice, was the head of the
              Psychological Care Centre (PCC) at the Military Medicine Institute
              during his 23 years with the SAF from 1986 to 2003.<br> <br> He said that of his 4,500 patients, there are fewer than 10 cases
              of full-time national servicemen (NSF).<br> <br> "I forward each NSF's case to the SAF. I believe the organisation
              should be responsible for its own soldiers," he said.<br> <br> But he thinks that the majority of these cases do not get picked
              up.<br> <br> "(When I was at PCC) I always made it a point to monitor those
              soldiers who had severe mental illnesses. I would even call their
              private psychiatrists to find out more.<br> <br> "Only if the organisation's leaders are committed to monitoring and
              helping these patients can they be given the right attention and
              help," Dr Ang said.<br> <br> Consultant psychiatrist Ken Ung of Adam Road Medical Centre said
              that when a soldier is found to be mentally ill, steps should be
              taken to ensure he is placed in a suitable working
              environment.<br> <br> Dr Ung, who sees about 30 to 50 cases of NSFs a month, said that
              superiors and colleagues should also understand that problematic
              soldiers may not always be trying to play the system.<br> <br> BE UNDERSTANDING<br> <br> "There are cases where the superiors are very understanding and
              sympathetic towards their condition and always willing to listen to
              them, and (the patients) thrive," he said.<br> <br> But those who had difficult bosses could lead to a downward spiral
              of the soldier's condition, he said.<br> <br> "I've had such patients who became more and more depressed,
              constantly had nightmares. Parents would complain about their
              behaviour and some even had suicidal thoughts," he said.<br> <br> Superiors should give their subordinates the benefit of the doubt,
              said Dr Ung, adding that they should be proactive and take the time
              to find out if their soldiers are all right.<br> <br> "The SAF is a microcosm of society. It's inevitable that you will
              get soldiers who are mentally ill. So you should learn how to
              handle and manage them."<br> <br> The Ministry of Defence (Mindef) said in a statement on Tuesday
              that it will study the State Coroner's findings carefully to
              improve and tighten its procedures to ensure better compliance by
              Singapore Armed Forces units in dealing with soldiers with mental
              problems.<br> <br> This article was published on April 12, 2014 in The New Paper.</p>
