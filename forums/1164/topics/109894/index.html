It is designed to be able to be deployed almost anywhere on any plateform as long as there is space. The Navy do not have to fix the system permanently on the ship but if it is required for them to do so, there are significant amount of space to accommodate a few.

            <div class='col-md body'>Unfortunately, we cannot know this for sure as they don't give out data on Herakles. But information on Arabel and EMPAR has been written in chinese journals. But based on what is common in past, normally like in this case, the french Horizon uses EMPAR, but they give Saudi the Arabel, and give Singapore the Herakles. Normally under such circumstances, it means the EMPAR is superior and more expensive.<br>Just like Norway uses the SPY-1F even though their ship is based on the Spanish F-100 which uses SPY-1D. So Norway buys cheaper radar.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Initially, that's what I thought too. But it has been written in chinese journals that this is a single radar. If fixed, it must be 4 panels, coz each side only cover 90 degrees. And judging from the size of our ship 3,200 tons, compared to 6,050 tons for Dutch ship with 4 panel radar APAR, our Herakles should be single-sided. Indeed, even the EMPAR is single-sided. The SAMPSON is double-side rotator.<br>So from what I understand, when the thing rotates, the whole structure rotates, unlike in a Sphere like EMPAR or SAMPSON, where the sphere is only an external layer.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>While it is true tht Singapore has a free hand in selecting radar (unike say Taiwan) , but EMPAR may not be suitable, as the Horizon is 6,700 tons. The EMPAR may be quite large, and that would have an adverse effect on stability by raising the centre of gravity. That is the reason why British developed the Spectar for smaller vessels (as compared their SAMPSON) and Dutch developed SEAPAR (as compared their APAR) for smaller vessels.<br>But of course, it is difficult to say whether Herakles is better than Arabel. Herakles work on S-band, while Arabel work on X-band.<br>Notice that our Scanter is X-band.<br>It is like this:<br>For Dutch, APAR is X-band, so they put search radar with longer wavelength.<br>For SIngapore, Herakles is S-band, Scanter is X-band for surface search.<br>Because X-band shorter wavelength not suitable for long range search, but needed for guidance of american SAMs.<br>For us, it is the opposite, because we don't use american SAMs, but use ASTER which is active-homing (self-guided in terminal phase).<br>But then we want good resolution for surface search to fulfil task of sea-patrol (ability to identify fishing boats from naval ship) so we use X-band surface search by Terma Scanter 2001.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by sane_guy2:</div><div class="quote_body">While it is true tht Singapore has a free hand in selecting radar (unike say Taiwan) , but EMPAR may not be suitable, as the Horizon is 6,700 tons. The EMPAR may be quite large, and that would have an adverse effect on stability by raising the centre of gravity. That is the reason why British developed the Spectar for smaller vessels (as compared their SAMPSON) and Dutch developed SEAPAR (as compared their APAR) for smaller vessels.<br>But of course, it is difficult to say whether Herakles is better than Arabel. Herakles work on S-band, while Arabel work on X-band.<br>Notice that our Scanter is X-band.<br>It is like this:<br>For Dutch, APAR is X-band, so they put search radar with longer wavelength.<br>For SIngapore, Herakles is S-band, Scanter is X-band for surface search.<br>Because X-band shorter wavelength not suitable for long range search, but needed for guidance of american SAMs.<br>For us, it is the opposite, because we don't use american SAMs, but use ASTER which is active-homing (self-guided in terminal phase).<br>But then we want good resolution for surface search to fulfil task of sea-patrol (ability to identify fishing boats from naval ship) so we use X-band surface search by Terma Scanter 2001.</div></blockquote>So that explains the ship's wide beam.....because if the whole thing is going to rotate......that's not light too, isn't it?<br><br>I wonder kind of RPM can you achieve with such a large assembly?<br><br>I think it's more like 2x radiators back to back.....maybe with one common RF Master Oscillator source switched between the two.....possible?</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>It is possible that it is actually 2 panels. This is like SAMPSON, with 2 panels, rotating at 60 rpm, ie 1 complete circle per second, and since 2 panels, it is like 2 circles per second. Compare this to EMPAR, which is 1 panel, and still 60 rpm. So SAMPSON rate of refreshment is double that of EMPAR.<br><br>SAMPSON is superior to EMPAR, the main reason for quarrel between UK and Italy, France, leading to break up of the Common European Frigate.<br>Because Italy and France don't want to spend too much money on a good radar, they don't need something this good.<br><br>It may be Herakles also 2 panel, 180 degrees apart, and I think most rotators are 60 rpm. Anything faster than 60 rpm would be hard, I guess, as radar is not that light.<br><br>It is possible Herakles is superior to Arabel in one area at least, that is longer effective detection range, since S-band.</div>
