            <div class='col-md body'>Actually, the Mossad is not without its own failures. And some of these failures occurred during the reprisal attacks post-Munich. Many of the attacks have since been re-examined, and those killed have been found to have tenuous links to the terrorists involved.<br><br>However, Israel has defended the killings, claiming that those it killed may not have been directly involved in the planning of the attacks (a retreat from the earlier justification...  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"> ) but were still instrumental in the over-all organisation that financed, planned and carried out the attacks. In other words, they need not have been directly linked to the attacks; so long as they were important in the organisation, they became legitimate targets, according to Israeli logic. Bit of a bummer for those dudes...  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br>The Mossad can be seen as the Israeli version of the CIA. And just like the CIA, they have their own successes and cock-ups. For those interested, a closer look at the Agaf Modiin or AMAN, the Israeli version of the DIA should be even more inspiring.</div>

The one I love best is planting a mini-bomb into a mobile phone and then giving it to a Palestinian terrorist. Mossad agents then called him, ascertained it was his voice, and then detonated the explosives in the phone.<br><br>The even filmed the scene from downstairs the target's apartment. Though the blinds were all drawn, there was a satisfying flash inside the house.<br><br>The genius wasn't in planting the bomb in thhe phone. The genius was in being able to give the phone to the intended target without the pig being suspicious.<br><br>Of course, Mossad have their bad days, but they are able to hide it as much as possible from the media thereby preserving a fearsome image.<br><br>But the poor CIA is often too clumsy to hide its actions and its dirty laundry are aired on TV all over the world.<br><br>So I end up with the impression that CIA is basically a hopeless case.

Hezbollah was initially started in Lebanon, as a direct result of the Israeli invasion. So it was, at least at the beginning, a legitimate resistance movement. And after the Israelis pulled out of Lebanon, the 'official' reason for the existence of Hezbollah was removed.<br><br>Of course, like many similar organizations, Hezbollah has since morphed into something different. It is very heavily involved in Lebanese politics, and offers many social welfare programs. It is very popular in certain parts of Lebanon. And unlike many other organizations, it actually tried to target the Tsahal exclusively, instead of 'civillian' targets. Of course, some times it didn't though, but by and large, its targets have been military.<br><br>On topic:<br>The Mossad kidon teams have since been criticised for targeting people who were only tenuously linked to the murder of the Israeli athletes. In fact, it has been argued that this was a deliberate policy, as the people assasinated were working towards making the whole Palestinian resistance movement a viable political force, and were skilled in economics and diplomacy rather than bomb-making and shooting. This SERIOUSLY impaired the Palestinian efforts to be anything more than a group of angry agitators. So, a cynical observer could argue that this achieved Israeli 'grand strategic' objectives of killing the very birth of a 'Palestinian state' by eliminating those who would be most useful in giving rise to it. Regardless, the kidonim did indeed pull off some pretty spectacular successes.</div>

The assassination team deployed through normal channels failed to complete their mission and publicly exposed the entire operation.<br><br>The second team which operated with full decentralized authority and freedom of movement achieved significant success in fulfilling their operational objectives and never compromised the operation.</blockquote><blockquote><strong>Recommendations:</strong> Although there are inherent differences between Israeli and U.S. policies, specifically those addressing the use of assassination as a political tool, important lessons may be gleaned from this study for policy makers.<br><br>Planners of sensitive covert operations must have a firm understanding of bureaucratic processes. Government bureaucracies inherently limit the degree of operational success by the nature of their systems. Bureaucracies cannot move effectively beyond a predetermined operational tempo, and impose fatal restraints regarding operational tradecraft and tactics.<br><br>Successful covert operations demand a flexible capability with full decentralized authority enabling officers to initiate actions as circumstances dictate, enhancing the operational success-failure ratio. When operational teams incorporate decentralized authority in concert with good tradecraft and tactical techniques, success is virtually assured.<br><br>Government agencies are capable of conducting decentralized, sensitive operations with reasonable operational control and an expectation of success.<br><br></blockquote><strong><a href="http://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/Holocaust/eichcap.html" rel="nofollow">The Capture of Adolf Eichmann<br>By Doron Geller</a></strong><br><br><img src="http://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/images/eichtrial.jpg"><br>The SS Lieutenant-Colonel who was Chief of the Jewish Office of the Gestapo during World War II and implemented the 'Final Solution' which aimed at the total extermination of European Jewry.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong><a href="http://www.channelnewsasia.com/documentary/list.htm" rel="nofollow">channel news asia introduction </a></strong><br><br>Documentary of the Week: Munich Deathlist<br>Sun, 12 Feb, 7.30pm.2006<br><br>In 1972 at the Summer Olympics in Munich, Germany 11 Israeli athletes were murdered by the Palestinian terrorist organisation, Black September. Within days of the massacre Israeli Prime Minister Golda Meir secretly ordered the Mossad to hunt down and assassinate all those who were responsible for the planning and execution of the Olympic massacre.<br><br>In the next seven years, more than 25 terrorists and terror masterminds were killed. This campaign, conducted by a specially trained hit-team, code named 'kidon' (bayonet in Hebrew) has been the subject of innumerable accounts by writers, journalists and filmmakers and is the basis of Steven Spielberg's new feature film "Munich."<br><br>Up till now, no-one in the Mossad was permitted to speak in detail about the extraordinary series of events, even for Spielberg's film. Munich Deathlist has secured this exclusive access and will therefore be an important documentary companion to the Hollywood release.<br><br>Some of the interviews will include:<br><br>1. Kidon - the Mossad's hit squad. The only interview with I.Z, the first Commander of Kidon, about the establishing of the unit and its targets. Interview with T.B - a senior Mossad operative about the operation mode and Interview with A.G - Chief Operations Officer of the Mossad.<br><br>2. On December 8, 1972, Dr. Mahmoud Hamshari, PLO delegate to France, heard the phone ring in his flat. As he answered and identified himself, he heard a high pitched whistle. The telephone exploded. Dr. Hamshari died in the hospital several hours later.<br><br>This programme Interviews in Israel and on location in Paris with Mossad agents in charge of following Hamshari, planting the explosive device in his telephone and calling him.<br><br>3. In July 1973, most Kidon operatives gathered in the town of Lillehammer in Northern Norway. They had concrete information that the most desired Mossad target, Ali Hassan Salameh (the operations officer of Black September), lived there. The Kidon assassins waited for their target and shot him. The following morning they realised they erred. The man they killed was an innocent Moroccan waiter. The Norwegian police arrested the assassins who broke down and confessed the murder, giving away the details of the operation.<br><br>That incident dramatically changed Mossad operations and led to the pinpoint accuracy of future killings.<br><br>Interviewees include: Zvi Zamir, Head of Mossad in the 1970's. T.B - A senior Mossad official and Uri Ne'eman - Head of IR (intelligence research ) in the Mossad.<br><br>4. In 1979 a car exploded in central Beirut, killing the Red Prince Ali Hassan Salameh. That was the last hit. It was the result of extensive information-gathering throughout Europe and the Middle East, with an important British link: The Mossad agent Erica Chambers, a UK citizen, traced the Red Prince in Beirut and "marked" him.<br><br>T.B flew to Lebanon, put together a sophisticated explosive device and handed it over to Erica, who put the explosives in Salameh's car. She received the sum of 10 million dollars for her services, returned to England and vanished.<br><br>Zvi Zamir, head of Mossad, reported to Israeli Prime Minister Menachem Begin: "We have completed the mission."<br><br>Interviewees include: The agent who assembled the explosive device; Senior CIA operatives; Zvi Zamir, Head of Mossad.<br></div>
