              <p>Oz &amp; SG are very close in no. of naval missiles launchers--SSM,SAM,ASW.</p>
              <p>This is not a bashing.x 3</p>
              <p>Though launchers of both countries are very close,</p>
              <p>there are many factors affecting the effectivness.Eg</p>
              <p>sensitivty and range of sensors</p>
              <p>sensor to weapons reactions time</p>
              <p>accuracy and range of weapons etc</p>
              <p>@@@@@@</p>
              <p>This is just a rough comparsions to make SG people feel comfortable.</p>
              <p>Many guys here say Oz is better than SG in this or that.</p>
              <p>Even it is the case,we still feel safe after discounting the fire power of SG!!</p>
              <p>Reasons are SG is just a tiny tiny portion in coastal line and land mass of Oz.</p>
              <p>Population is just 25% of Oz.So,a discounted fire power will do.</p>
              <p>Once again,pl note it is just a comparsions to pass this boring weekend,</p>
              <p>not a bashing thread.</p>

              <p>The US is nearly alone in the world in that it spent decades working to perfect the a combat management system that would allow it to handle saturation attacks the Russians wanted to employ against carrier battlegroups. The work began as far bacck when the USS Enterprise was launched initially with PESA phased array radars, and with the CGN Long Beach which had massive PESA phased array radars. The radar system was termed as "SCANFAR". Back then, the US Navy was pursuing a system called "Typhon" that was predecessor system of the Aegis. That didn't work and was cancelled in the 60s but a lot of the developmental work went into Aegis. The first Aegis platform was the CG Ticonderonga because the system was massive enough that it required a ship of that size to be installed. Later they trimmed some of the capability to squeeze it into an Arleigh Burke. They will soon replace the current SPY-1 radar with the SPY-3, but I suspect, it will take them a while to get it fixed (someone on some other forum listed down a large laundry list of problems that plague the Zumwalt destroyers. Quite simply, he said that it will likely not work well at all without substantial redesigning.)</p>
              <p>Why Europe would never ever match the US in AA is in part because the
              stingy bastards can't fork out as much cash on R&amp;D as the US can. They instead resort to methods such as revolving their phased array radars just so they can cut down on costs. I think only the Germans didn't revolve their phased array radars, while the Brits and French do on their destroyers. The Spanish bought the SPY-1F. On the other hand, the Koreans and the Japanese adopted the Aegis system on their destroyers. The KDX-III is practically a CG in its own right.</p>

              <h3><span lang="EN-AU">Comments</span></h3>
              <h2><span lang="EN-AU">General</span></h2>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span lang="EN-AU">As one might
                  guess from the name, the <em>Anzac</em> class
                  frigates are indeed a result of a joint project between us and our trans-Tasman
                  neighbours. A total of ten, virtually identical, units were built in modules by
                  a number of yards, most in Australia
                  one in New Zealand, and
                  assembled in Melbourne.
                  The RAN received 8 ships and the RNZN received 2 (the 2<sup>nd</sup> and 4<sup>th</sup> in the <span class="GramE">production<span>  </span>run</span>).</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span lang="EN-AU">As with some
                  other ship currently in the RAN, the <em>Anzac</em> class are the result of a flawed set of procurement imperatives. As will be
                  discussed later, they envisaged essentially as overgrown Offshore Patrol
                  Vessels, and as such were conceived horribly underarmed. As a result of their
                  heritage, the first units commissioned without any ability to persecute surface
                  contacts other than the main gun, and without any meaningful anti-air
                  capability. As it is, they still don’t have a dedicated helicopter, although
                  that can be blamed on a <em>separate</em> program failure. Luckily, the ships were designed with the ability to mount
                  substantially more equipment than was originally fitted, and this is being done
                  relatively briskly.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span lang="EN-AU">In service the <em>Anzac</em> class are used as patrol frigates,
                  and when the Harpoon <span class="SpellE">SSMs</span> are fitted and their
                  helicopter finally arrives they will be a potent anti-ship asset, especially in
                  the littoral environment. Their main gun also gives them a useful ability to
                  persecute targets ashore in support of ground forces (this is also true, <span class="GramE">although<span>  </span>to</span> a lesser
                  extent, of the Harpoon missiles). Interestingly, the main gun was used by HMAS <em>Anzac</em> in support of British Royal
                  Marines during the 2003 invasion of Iraq, which makes her the only ship
                  currently in RAN service to fire in anger. </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span lang="EN-AU">With upgrades
                  the class will develop a meaningful point defence capability. This will be
                  through two layers of missiles (ESSM and probably Mistral 2) guided most
                  probably <span class="GramE">be</span> a modern active phased-array radar (the
                  CEA FAR). The <em>Anzacs</em> could also have
                  a useful anti-submarine function if <span class="GramE">they<span>  </span>are</span> ever fitted with a towed array
                  sonar, although there is no plan to do so at the moment.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span lang="EN-AU"> </span></p>
              <h2><span lang="EN-AU">Upgrades</span></h2>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span lang="EN-AU">Upgrades to the
                  baseline <em>Anzac</em> class frigate fall
                  under several programs, and are essential for turning these ships into fully
                  useful members of the fleet. Some upgrades were planned as part of the initial
                  project planning. This is particularly true of the Evolved Sea Sparrow Missile
                  (ESSM). Because the missile would not be available for the commissioning of the
                  first two vessels, they had to make do with the older NATO Sea Sparrow missile.
                  From HMAS <span class="SpellE"><em>Warramunga</em></span> onwards, ESSM have been carried from build, but the intention was always to
                  refit the older vessels to the same standard. The major upgrade is the
                  replacement of the CW Mk.73 Mod.1 with the Australian developed and
                  manufactured CEA SSCWI. The SSCWI offers roughly similar functionality to the
                  CW Mk.73 (the major difference being the ability to control ESSM), but is a
                  more advanced solid-state design which is substantially more reliable.
                  Interestingly enough, the RAN is the first of the 10 navies in the ESSM program
                  to declare its ESSM capability in-service, a notable achievement.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span lang="EN-AU"><span> </span>It was originally envisaged, prior to <em>Anzac’s</em> commissioning, that all the
                  class would go through the so called Weapons Improvement Programme (WIP). This
                  plan was shelved as the price of the project rose. For a while, therefore,
                  there <span class="GramE">was</span> few plans for major upgrades in the early
                  service life of the ships.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span lang="EN-AU">With the release
                  of the 2000 Defence White Paper, upgrades were back on the cards. One of the
                  stated aims of the White Paper as <span class="GramE">it<span>  </span>related</span> to the RAN, was to improve
                  anti-missile capabilities across the fleet. For the <em>Anzac’s</em> this was already partially in hand with the arrival of the
                  ESSM into service, but it was decide that more needed to be done. Consequently
                  project SEA 1448 Anzac ASMD (Anti-Ship Missile Defence) Upgrade was born. There
                  are two essential planks to the ASMD being proposed, a new inner layer weapons
                  system, and <span class="GramE">a new</span> fire control radar to make better
                  use of the ESSM.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span lang="EN-AU">Given the engagement envelope of the ESSM it was presumed by
                  most (myself included) that the Government would opt to add the proven, already
                  in RAN service, Vulcan Phalanx CIWS as a last ditch missile defence system.
                  Indeed the RNZN <em>Anzacs</em> already have a
                  Phalanx mounted aft, at rear end of the hanger roof. The pundits, <span class="GramE">myself</span> included, were wrong. As of 2003 the Department of
                  Defence instead expressed a preference for a missile based system, <span class="GramE">an</span> Point Defence Missile System (PDMS). Further they expressed
                  a preference for the French <span class="SpellE">Sadral</span> system firing
                  Mistral 2 missiles. This decision didn’t make a whole lot of sense to those of
                  us yet to be enlightened by behind-the-scenes work on the project. <span class="GramE">An</span> PDMS makes a certain amount of sense, but Mistral does not. </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span lang="EN-AU">There are a variety of PDMS options available, the best by virtually any means
                  of measurement being the American-German RAM (Rolling Airframe Missile) system.
                  Compared to the <span class="SpellE">Sadral</span> system the RAM is: longer
                  ranged, has a superior seeker, is being produced in larger numbers (i.e. for
                  the USN and <span class="SpellE">Kiegermarine</span>), and can be self contained
                  (in the <span class="SpellE">SeaRAM</span> variant, itself a modification of the
                  Vulcan Phalanx system). The big advantage of SADRAL is that it is cheaper for
                  initial purchase… The fundamental effectiveness of the system remains to be
                  seen, but is still an improvement over nothing. <span class="GramE">At<span>  </span>the</span> moment plans call for the
                  instillation of a pair of 6 round launchers at the after end of the hanger (see
                  image of one potential installation, made by AMT).</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span lang="EN-AU">The second
                  component of SEA 1448 is investigating the fitting of <span class="GramE">a new</span> active phased array fire control radar, the Australian designed and
                  manufactured CEA FAR. To this end HMAS <span class="SpellE"><em>Arunta</em></span> was fitted with a single FAR panel for tests during
                  2003, although <a href="http://www.geocities.com/randomsran/3dimage1.jpg">this</a> image from AMT would seem to suggest that there were
                  provisions for more (from the pictures, it would appear that 6 is the preferred
                  number). Reports from the test were positive, although not gushingly so. It is
                  expected to fit the completed system to ships between 2008 and 2010. Options
                  for instillation include a multi-panel version of the trial installation, or
                  mounting them on the mast (see this <a href="http://www.geocities.com/randomsran/Option-4-B5-Is.jpg">AMT generated CAD</a> for one such option). To make
                  full use of the new radar and other systems being integrated into the class,
                  the <span class="SpellE">CelsiusTech</span> 9LV 453 Mk.3 consols are being
                  replaced by the Mk.3E standard COTS (Commercial <span class="GramE">Off The</span> Shelf) consols, which are ergonomically better and will improve processing
                  speeds.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span lang="EN-AU">The other major
                  upgrade announced for the <em>Anzacs</em> in
                  the 2000 White Paper was the fitting of anti-ship missiles (SSM). The logical
                  choice was the Boeing Harpoon II system, which has a useful secondary land
                  attack capability. The contract for 64 missiles (i.e. 8 missiles for the 8 <em>Anzac</em> <span class="GramE">class</span>,
                  with no war stocks) was signed in late 2002. HMAS <span class="SpellE"><em>Warrmunga</em></span> is the first ship so
                  fitted, during a scheduled refit period in late 2004, and others will follow.
                  Interestingly the two Mk.141 launchers have been placed forward of and below
                  the bridge (a very British place to put them…), while they have been mounted
                  behind the bridge (and at least two decks higher up) in other MEKO 200 ships.
                  Officially this has been explained as a measure to improve stability in the
                  class which is apparently a cause for concern. It is possible that this concern
                  is precautionary given the likely inclusion in the near future of the CEA FAR
                  instillation. </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span lang="EN-AU">Otherwise this concern bodes badly for the class, as top weight
                  growth is inevitable as part of SEA 1448. Some comment has been raised as a
                  result of the first photos of the instillation that the cabling has been poorly
                  done, being exposed and unarmoured (which poses reliability and damage control
                  problems). It is unclear as to whether these problems have been either: a).
                  imagined, b). rectified. It is also possible that the photos did not show the
                  final instillation and the concerns are therefore invalid.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span lang="EN-AU">Finally as with
                  the <span class="SpellE"><em>Adelaides</em></span>,
                  the <em>Anzacs</em> will be fitted with the
                  Thomson Marconi TMS 5424 Petrel mine avoidance sonar, and have space and weight
                  provisions for a towed array sonar. Also as with the <span class="SpellE">FFGs</span>,
                  there are currently no plans to fit a towed array sonar, which is disappointing
                  given the growing submarine forces to Australia’s immediate North (one of the
                  few regions in the world where the submarine threat is growing).</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-AU">In the future there are a number of
                  further options. The design has weight and space margins exist to fit another
                  8-cell VLS next to the existing system. The instillation of this extra VLS
                  would make sense if the RAN decides to use the upgraded <em>Anzacs</em> as ‘goal-keepers’ for the yet to enter service <span class="SpellE">LHDs</span> instead of an AWD/FFG. The goal-keeper was a British
                  innovation whereby an important ship with poor air-point-defence is guarded by
                  a ship with good point-defence AA which holds position very close to <span class="GramE">it’s</span> charge. In this role the upgraded <em>Anzac</em> makes better sense than an AWD/FFG, as it’s radar
                  instillation is tailored to close range ASMD, and the PDMS has range to keep
                  another ship within the ‘last-ditch’ engagement envelope (unlike the CIWS of
                  the FFG). The additional 8 VLS cells would give another 32 ESSM, which is
                  important given the goal-keeper doctrine which emphasises the saturation of any
                  potential threat, and thus the extra missiles would be of great use. NB: At the
                  moment no plans exist for this instillation. </span></p>
