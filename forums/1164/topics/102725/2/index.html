The Bear and The Dragon.... it stereotypes Chinese women as really loose.<br><br>In addition, I can understand that his being American would inevitably lead him to trump the might of the American military..... but his trumping-up process is just too much for me to bear. In Executive Orders..... basket..... the only American casualties sustained on the ground were the crew of a single HumVee (right?) How can that be when the Americans were outnumbered by more than six to one? (20 Iraqi/Iranian brigades vs 3 American regiments)<br><br>Even if the Americans have more advanced technology (which they do), surely the casualties would be a lot more than that?</div>
