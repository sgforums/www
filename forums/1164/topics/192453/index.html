            <div class='col-md body'>India expanding military ties with China<br>By Kushal Jeena<br>United Press International<br>Published June 6, 2006<br><br>NEW DELHI -- Indian defense minister Pranab Mukherjee's recent visit to China indicates the emergence of a creative regional security strategy that boosts New Delhi's global image, Indian defense analysts said Tuesday.<br><br>"Mukherjee's recent visit to China, has consolidated the new strategy by expanding the military ties with China," said A.B. Mahapatra, the director of the Centre for Asian Studies, a New Delhi based think tank.<br><br>Mahapatra said Mukherjee capped it all at the end of his visit where he unveiled a comprehensive defense strategy that was aimed at reinforcing India's traditional claim of a central security role on the Asian continent and Indian Ocean.<br><br>In a landmark development, India and China inked a pact to expand military cooperation between two Asian giants during defense minister Mukherjee's recent three-nation tour.<br><br>As part of the second leg of his visit, Mukherjee arrived in Beijing June 4 to sign a military accord, which the Indian defense establishment said would institutionalize training, exercises and other contacts between the two countries.<br><br>"During the visit, India and China signed a memorandum of understanding on exchanges and cooperation in the field of defense," the Indian foreign office said in a statement. On the military pact, the Indian defense ministry said it was aimed at developing a strategic and cooperative partnership for peace and prosperity between India and China.<br><br>During his Monday visit to Beijing, Mukherjee held discussions with his Chinese counterpart, Cao Gangchun, and foreign minister Li Zhaoxing. The Indian embassy in Beijing said the two sides held talks on wide ranging issues, including military and security cooperation.<br><br>"My efforts will be to have a much larger participation in joint military exercises, more exchange visits by armed forces personnel and an expanded mutual training program," Mukherjee said.<br><br>The Indian defense minister said the visit was an important milestone and a major confidence building measure in Sino-India relations. The defense agreement signed during the visit could become an instrument for a regular and sustained dialogue between the two sides on issues relating to defense.<br><br>The relations between the two countries have never been as cordial as they are today. Diplomatic ties between the two were severed after they fought a small but bitter war in 1962, which ended in India's defeat. India took the initiative in the early 1990s to improve relations, but they have yet to resolve a long-standing boundary dispute.<br><br>The India-China military pact assumes significance on the heels of reports that China has been providing military assistance to India's archrival Pakistan.<br><br>The two principles at the core of the defense doctrine Mukherjee presented to China are India's determination to become a major power on the Asian continent and the designation of the Indian Ocean as a peace zone.<br><br>Following remarkable improvement in its relations with the United States and other western countries, India has been working hard to raise its standing in matters of Asian security.<br><br>During his China visit, Mukherjee was given an in-depth presentation of China's military modernization program by Gen Guo Boxiong, vice chairman of the central military commission of China. "We both reiterated that reform of the military should not be seen as a threat to each other," Mukherjee said after the presentation.<br><br>In Japan, Mukherjee was apprised of Tokyo's concerns regarding China's military build-up. Japan also sought India's support in calling for greater transparency in Beijing's defense program for the sake of overall Asian stability.<br><br>Mukherjee told the Japanese that China had been an important military power from the beginning. "We are fully aware of it, but every country has its own perception of the development and modernization of their armed forces," Mukherjee said.<br><br>Chinese authorities welcomed the argument of Mukherjee, saying India has distanced itself from the Japanese viewpoint of Beijing's military build-up, which Tokyo says is posing a threat to the stability to the Asian continent.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>U.S. militarism is at least as off-putting as China's. And it threatens to section the world into a pair of warring camps. Not a good idea: "If we end up with a closed Asian bloc centered on China on the western side of the Pacific, with a rival bloc centered on the U.S. on the eastern side, rivalry, antagonism and conflict will be inevitable." That was the thought of Lee Hsien Loong, the prime minister of Singapore, which hosted the conference. Singapore has been a staunch U.S. ally, but if the mutual bulk-ups continue, it is uncertain how much longer that will last.<br><br>There has been an unsettling discordance about U.S. policy toward China that was brought home anew by Donald Rumsfeld recently at the Asia Security Summit in Singapore. Why this discredited man with his failed Iraqi policies remains U.S. Secretary of Defense is a profound mystery only the ever-loyal President George W. Bush can possibly unravel. But there he was, as a principal speaker, jabbering at the summit, and yet -- fully five years into the job -- still parsing out the nuances of the Sino-U.S. relationship in public. It was as if the utter necessity of getting along with China was somehow a new hard-to-grasp idea.<br><br>Five years as defense secretary should be enough time to get that all-important relationship right and tight. Thus, it was pleasant to see that the immediate Western news-media reports from the International Institute for Strategic Studies conference suggested that Rummy was getting closer than ever to peaceful coherence.<br><br>In remarks formal and informal, the defense boss painted a regional international relations picture that was more modified multilateral mosaic than pointed unilateral unicorn.<br><br>It emphasized a bigger picture of cooperation over a narrower vision of confrontation. Afterward, one noted Asia hand concluded optimistically that "it is clear that there is a kinder, gentler view in the Pentagon toward China." I think not: As the saying goes, the wish is often father to the thought.<br><br>In reality, our Pentagon in America is focused, not unwisely because that is its primary job, on China's continuing military bulk-up. Americans are warned regularly, through periodic reports and episodic statements, of its relentless ferocity.<br><br>Warnings are worth getting, but what's harder to get a handle on is the melodramatic Pentagon story line. The idea under official conveyance appears to be that some major mystery surrounds the bulk-up. There's no mystery at all. Three reasons readily explain what China is up to militarily.<br><br>The first reason is that economically expanding nations almost always simultaneously increase their arms spending. Certainly, both growing India and now growing Russia have increased their spending.<br><br>The second is that the official stated Chinese policy of eventual integration of Taiwan into historic "mother" China, probably in a Hong Kong style confederation arrangement, depends vitally -- Beijing believes -- on its own military credibility. Continuing with this logic, it is Beijing's view that the greater the arms gap between the mainland and the island, the less likely war will be resorted to. In this way, Beijing reasons, the faster the mainland bulk-up, the sooner the political integration, the faster the cooling of feral nationalistic fever on the mainland on the Taiwan issue, and the more permanent and reality-based becomes the true passage of peace across the Taiwan Strait.<br><br>The third reason for China's not-so-mysterious bulk-up is as plain as the nose on Rumsfeld's face. It is an absolutely logical response to America's buildup. Why it is that U.S. leaders seem incapable of understanding this continuing factor in world politics is utterly mystifying.<br><br>What precise theory of exceptionalism would allow the United States to forge ahead militarily, spending far more of its national treasure on arms both proportionately and aggregately than other countries, but would also forbid other nations from doing the same?<br><br>Is it that the United States would never, ever (in a million years) use its vast military might without unequivocal international sanction to do so? Right but...then there's Iraq.<br><br>Is it that it's okay for the United States to possess a vast stockpile of weapons but it's not okay that others have them, precisely because we would never use them but they might? Maybe but... Hiroshima and Nagasaki. (This thought is never lost in Asia, by the way.)<br><br>Is it that U.S. military doctrine is clearly defensive and pacific and trustworthy, unlike those of almost all present and would-be nuclear powers? Well...many nations (like China) have a announced nuclear-weapons policies that expressly prohibit nuclear use unless in retaliation for a nuclear attack by another. Guess which superpower has consistently refused to offer the world a no-first use policy?<br><br>All of the above seems to me to add up to a totally satisfying explanation of what China is up to. It is no more mysterious than America's own military bulk-up. If we want others to build down their forces, then we have to downsize ours as well so that we can then righteously insist that others follow our lead.</div>

That is the reason why USA is successful in the first place,right? Soviet Union is never a capitalism country and never reach the economic lvl of PRC.. With South Korea being disillusion of US policy of supporting Japan more than South Korea over WWII atrocities issue and territory rights. South Korea may side PRC soon! Russia hate US more than China... Having been the arch rival during cold war and recently trying to steal its sphere of influence in central Asian and Ukarine. Russia rather makes friend with China than US and clearly shown by opposing every policy of US and support China. As China is stronger and stronger each day with economic and military,more countries is looking upwards at China.

Even when China was at her evilest under Mao, China could only harm her own citizens, but not neigboring countries, lest alone countries harlfway around the globe.<br><br>On the other hand, when Bush thinks you have WMD and belong to the "axis of evil", he can go medieval on you, big  time. His words are backed by global military bases, 12 CVGs and half a trillion dollar military.<br><br></div>
