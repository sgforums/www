If you know how to use a M16 then using a AK-47 is even easiler .<br><br>Don't think that there is extra need to go for range. Why ? even if you train to shoot with a AK-47 , if you ever pick up an other AK-47, the zeroing of it also will not be the same. Just do what the russian taught their soldiers, go for auto burst and hope you hit the target.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Yes, the Indonesian weapon is the FN-FNC. It is made under license in Indonesia.<br><br>Peter Kokalis review of the weapon here:<br>http://remtek.com/arms/fn/fnc/index.htm<br><br>Being locally-made in Indonesia does raise questions about quality.<br><br>But funny you should call it CAL as the CAL is a very rare but unsuccessful predecessor to the FNC.<br><br>I definitely we should learn to use the weapons of neighbouring countries. In times of war, whether they become our enemy or ally, it would be helpful that we are at least familiar with where all the switches are.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>thanks guys...yep....found out it was the FN-FNC myself...haiz..talk about momentary memory loss...  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes">  Yeah, I did remember reading something abt FN-CAL before; an unsuccessful follow-up to the FAL...chamber problems or something.<br><br>Anyway, I think these 1-2 day instruction classes on foreign assault rifles is a good idea. No need to expand on crew-served weapons or the like...just simple classes on field-stripping, sighting, etc...keep our infantry guys occupied for their NS career....LOL  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"></div>
