Â“We are ready to export the aircraft to friendly countries, especially the Arab states,Â” disclosed Air Marshal Aurangzeb Khan, Chairman of Pakistan Aeronautical Complex (PAC) Board, in an interview with Khaleej Times, at the conclusion of the Dubai 2005 Air Show. He said that the fighter jet, JF-17 Thunder, was expected to be on static display and also take part in aerobatics at the Dubai 2007 Air Show. Â“The manufacturing of all-weather JF-17 Thunder, a multi-role and light weight fighter aircraft, marks a significant milestone towards technological advancement by the PAC,Â” Khan said. Â“This initiative by an under-developed country like Pakistan needs to be encouraged so that we are able to help our friends,Â” he added. He said that the PAC has co-ventured with CATIC of China on the development and production of the JF-17 Thunder whose prototype is flying. Â“At the PAC in Kamra, Pakistan, we are doing 58 per cent of the airframe and majority of the avionics in addition to stuffing, final assembling and flight testing,Â” Khan said.<br></blockquote>Based on US assessment, The JF17 is considered the equal to earlier versions of the F16, but only 80 percent as effective as more recent F16 models at a low cost of 20 million USD maximum.<br><br>Source: <a href="http://www.strategypage.com/htmw/htairfo/articles/20060501.aspx" rel="nofollow">http://www.strategypage.com/htmw/htairfo/articles/20060501.aspx</a><br><br>The JF17 figures a JSF-style engine inlets considered the world 1st such inlet in service( F35 yet to formally enter service).<br><br>Source: <a href="http://www.flightglobal.com/Articles/2006/05/08/Navigation/177/206499/Pictures+China's+Chengdu+FC-1+fighter+performs+first+flight+with+JSF-style+engine.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.flightglobal.com/Articles/2006/05/08/Navigation/177/206499/Pictures+China's+Chengdu+FC-1+fighter+performs+first+flight+with+JSF-style+engine.html</a><br><br><blockquote>Changes to ChinaÂ’s Chengdu FC-1 lightweight fighter are clearly visible in recently released photographs (pictured below) of the redesigned fourth prototypeÂ’s first flight on 28 April. Joint Strike Fighter (JSF)-style Â“diverterlessÂ” engine inlets lead the design revisions.<br><br>In addition to redesigned intakes, the fourth prototype has larger wing leading-edge root extensions, longer ventral strakes either side of the aft fuselage, and a taller, less swept fin. The design changes were made after problems surfaced during testing of the first three prototypes. The FC-1 first flew in August 2003.<br><br>The redesigned inlets closely resemble those of the Lockheed Martin F-35 JSF. In place of the conventional ramp of the original two-dimensional intake, the new design features a Â“humpÂ” to aerodynamically divert turbulent boundary-layer airflow away from the engine inlet. Lockheed has said its design is more stealthy than conventional inlets.<br><br></blockquote>What will be the impact should the 1st such Muslim made fighter jet into the world market after china fully Â“ TOTÂ” the JF-17 ( FC-1 coded by ChineseÂ” to Pakistan?</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Apart from the some what inappropriate 'Islamic fighter jet' term, i think the FC-1 is quite a success. Firstly, developing nations now have an alternative source of fighter jets which is definitely much cheaper. Secondly, though we can't tell the actual performance of this aircraft for sure at the moment but it certainly does looks quite good on paper for that price.  But i think the J-10's future looks even more promising. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>But Gents, u canÂ’t deny itÂ’s a smart tactics to label the plane as Â“IÂ” for marketing purpose, although the word itself is rather sensitive in todayÂ’s situation.<br><br>1st, some development fund for the fighter is from Arabic fund long time supporting Pakistan, then, if PAF set to buy at least 150 such fighters initially, I think such funding will play a substantial role as well.<br><br>2nd, when Pakistan starts manufacturing the JF17, it will not only equip its own airforce with the fighter, but also export such planes to fellow Â“ Muslim brotherhoods Â“ countries like Morocco, Bangladeshi, Egypt, even Malaysia, Remember, when the Pakistani PM visited KL last July, he did present the JF17 to his Malaysian counterpart. So the word Â“IslamicÂ” though sensitive, but rather accurate and clear to track  how the JF-17 being marketed after it developed successfully.<br><br>We may leave aside the part of Â“IÂ” and concentrate more on the JF-17Â’s spec and how it could be marketed.    <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_redface.gif" alt="Embarassed" title="Embarassed">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>See how the Pakistanis are writing and taking all the credit for the hard work done by the Chinese engineers.<br><br>The Dawn Press Service<br>Karachi<br><br>The pictures of the Chief of Air Staff, Air Chief Marshal, Tanveer Mehmud Ahmed, standing next to the latest generation fighter JF-17 being co-developed by China and Pakistan, has made every Pakistani proud. But the photo-op is only the tip of the iceberg. During an exclusive interview with the Air Chief, the Dawn has learnt that there are complexities that are beyond the comprehension of the enlightened common man and it takes the genius of people like the Air Chief to solve these issues in order to maintain the cutting-edge of the PAF.<br><br>According to the the Air Chief, it all started when the Air Chief decided to sit inside the cockpit of the JF-17 Â– a simple task no doubt our readers will agree. Â“But I soon realized that canopy would not close Â– the issue being that the cockpit was designed for a 5Â’ chinaman pilot <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">{This is their description of a Chinese and these Pakistanis love comparison, earlier they compared Indians and said that One Pakistani= 3 Indians. After the war they swallowed it}whereas PAF pilots Â– our strapping Punjabi lads Â– average 5Â’10, my own height being 5Â’11Â”. He immediately rushed to the design bureau and a brainstorming session was held with the design engineers. A computer-modelled geometric analysis revealed the root cause: there is 6Â” of clearance between the chinamanÂ’s head and the bottom of the canopy. That left 4Â” short for the Pakistani pilot.<br><br>2Â” was obtained by removing the seat cushion bottom - this was suggested by the The Air Chief himself, no less! The Air Chief who started his career flying Tiger Moths in WWII, is a strong believer of core flying principles i.e a pilot should know how to fly by the seat of his pants.<img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">{Sometimes they even fly without pants} The Air Chief claims proudly that this measure will radically improve the man-machine interface. Infact this will now be used as a pilot program to test if seat cushions should be removed on all other fighters of the PAF as well.<img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br>For the balance 2Â”, one of the bright Chinese design engineers who had spent time at the Toshiba wafer labs in Tokyo, came up with the idea of adopting pushers to force the canopy closed as soon as the pilot sits in the seat, similar to the pushers in the Tokyo subway system who push passengers into subway cars in rush hour. The Air Chief immediately agreed to the idea rather than going back to the drawing board to redesign the airframe that would take about 10 years. The Chinese agreed to reinforce the canopy locks to prevent accidental opening during mid-flight, due to head pressure from the inside.{Take note}<br><br>The Chinese also agreed to supply additional ladders free of cost for the starboard side for the pushers to climb and be ready to Â‘pushÂ’ the pilots in. Other benefits were gained as well: because the pilot now sits in a Â“pressurizedÂ” zone between the canopy and the seat, there is no need for a safety-belt, thus improving scramble time. Also, the pilotÂ’s head is now naturally angled at 60 deg declination thus ensuring he has a direct line of sight to the instrument panel, pre-empting critics who said that the instrument panel was not well laid out.<br><br>Dear readers, our proud country is blessed to have people of this caliber{The Chinese who provided the solution} or the dumbass airchief . <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Racial discrimination means making fun of a particular race or creed or religion, sect etc. But here, there is no discrimination since no particular religion or nationality is attacked but a particular section (the fundamentalists, jihadi elements etc).
