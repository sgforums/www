It is rumored that the Chinese is veri keen on the F-16 designs and would like to use them as mass replacement for their aging J-7 fleet. But they ran into some problems when they tried to "Chiong" the design of the Russian AL-31F engines and the sales of the engines were dirupted.</div>

The new weapon, to be known as the FD-60, is already in service with the People's Liberation Army Air Force as the PL-11.<br><br>In China it equips the Shen- yang J-8II 'Finback' interceptor but, according to the manufacturer, the export version is intended for the F-16 - a clear signal that Pakistan could be the lead customer.<br><br>Development of the FD-60 (PL-11) began in 1987 and was completed in 2000, according to the China National Precision Machinery Import &amp; Export Corporation (CPMIEC). The weapon is described as an air-launched version of the LY-60 surface-to-air missile. It uses semi-active radar homing.<br><br>The missile borrows heavily from Aspide technology supplied by Italy before an arms embargo was imposed on China following the Tiananmen Square massacre.<br><br>China also had access to early-model US-built AIM-7 Sparrow missiles acquired via Vietnam, from which the Aspide itself is derived. Since the late 1980s Chinese technicians have been developing a Sparrow-class missile.<br><br>"Until now most observers had assessed the PL-11/FD-60 programme as a largely unsuccessful effort that had been overtaken by the more advanced PL-12/SD-10 active-radar AAM, developed under the leadership of the China National Aero-Technology Import and Export Corp (CATIC). However, it now appears that work on the PL-11/FD-60 has continued, perhaps to provide a back-up capability in the event of problems with the PL-12/SD-10 but also because CPMIEC has identified an export market for the missile.<br><br><strong>As the FD-60 is based largely on the Aspide/Sparrow design, integrating it with US-built aircraft should be relatively straightforward. Such a missile would be of great interest to existing customers of Chinese equipment, such as Pakistan and Iran, that have inventories of US fighters for which they cannot obtain advanced weapons - chiefly BVR missiles. </strong><br></blockquote></span></div>
