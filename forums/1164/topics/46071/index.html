Sure, buying Hawks are cheaper, but it gets us nowhere. Whats it got to do with someone at Tengah anyway?

The 6 days war between Israeli and the 3 neighbouring Arab countries were fought in 1967. Israeli bomb Iraq nuclear plant in 1980. During the 6 days war, Israeli had predominately French made Mirage 3 and the own copycat version. F16 Vipers were only designed in the mid 1970 and started IOC only in the very late 70, early 80s (about the time RSAF first bought the F5Es).</div>

In fact the US is finding itself in a similar situation, though much less so, hence the scrapping of the EF-111 and letting the Prowler take over USAF EW duties. The trend today is using multirole fighters which can take on air superiority, deep strike, CAS, BAI and a whole lot o other roles. This is evident worldwide, not just restricted to Singapore<br><br>As for the US$2 million A-4, is that in 1970s dollars?   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br>And besides, CAS is not the A-4s only job. The A-4 in the RSAF has more roles than that.</div></blockquote>can't really remember well,, thinkn i read it off Janes or some other defence mags, tot there was this plan to convert A-4SU into unmanned aircraft for recon of as targets for training?</div>
