              <p>hi 4justice</p>
              <p>thank you for starting this thread.</p>
              <p>i am a airsoft fan for the past 20 years.  during my time, we had brands like JAC and MGC who have all closed down since.  i remeber during the early 90s we were still able to send the pieces in by mail.  but after 911, this is almost impossible.</p>
              <p>as to whether if these guns are illegal or not in Singapore, i declare "yes it is illegal"  i have first hand knowledge of this. perhaps i should  not bore u with my story.</p>
              <p>after all these years, i am still an airsoft fan and i am really excited to find all this activity on the internet.  of course during my time, there were no internet (we had bbs and 2400 bps dialups) so it was hard to get ppl of the same interest together.  we had my bunch of friends but as the years went by my bunch moved on to other legal things like cars n other extreme sports.</p>
              <p>funny how u lost half a tooth. i too lost half a cannie during one of my skrmishes.  when we started, we used no protective gear...until one my my friend go shot in the eye (he say a bb sized black circle in that eye for the next 3 days) then we started to wear goggles. then i got shot in the mouth and lost half a teeth, then the rest of us began to wear full face mask! ha ha ha</p>
              <p>in any one game, we would spend about 2000 bb rounds (about 1 bag) and last time i counted, i got shot at least 72 times at the end of the night. we used full auto so if one got shot, it would be at least 5-10 rounds on the skin. ha ha ha.  so does it hurt? yes i think it hurts enough to tell u that u have been hit.  i have also tried paintball but still i prefer the rapid fire and the range and the accuracy of the airsoft guns. it was also that time, battery operated tokyo marui guns came on the market so were able to go full auto with lugging around big tanks of compressed gas.</p>
              <p>thanks for bringing back the memories 4justice. most of my bunch nw would be in their late 30's . i will call them and tell them about this forum so they can log in and see how the scene has advance since our time, and maybe....just maybe pick up the hobby again!</p>

              <p>hey mark, im glad you enjoyed this thread. your bunch should pick it up again! most of the guys i airsoft with here in uk are in their 30s to 50s, often ex-military. age is not a barrier for this sport, because there is something for everyone, whether you like running around a lot, or sitting and waiting for that perfect shot.</p>
              <p>funny enuf, unlike most of yr friends, my interest developed in cars, then airsoft, altho military interest came even before that.</p>
              <p>btw, if you like, pop over to <a href="http://shoot.sgboards.com/">http://shoot.sgboards.com/</a> I post there as well, when i am not in classes or on World of Warcraft =P. heck if u want to, sign up with <a href="http://arniesairsoft.co.uk/forums/">http://arniesairsoft.co.uk/forums/</a> too. its a uk based forums, but is considered one of the big international online airsoft communities around. I post there too.</p>
