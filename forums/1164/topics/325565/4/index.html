              <p>i never asked them. but i always find it really really cool. ive always thought of buying a mannequin and dressing it up in all me gear and kit. so when open mob, can just grab from it and go.</p>
              <p>got like 2 kits (old SBO, new LBV)</p>
              <p>and probably during reservist going to get another new LBV and kit. so probably can outfit 3 models :)</p>

              <p>the newer one is screwed up. i like the molles system. means i can custom config my LBV and the number of pouches. but the mesh system is really dumb. causes heat rash. and it really sucks if you are out in the field for like 3 days and with a real bad heat rash, its a major pain in the ass</p>

              <p>Ah. Is that an actual pic of the LBV you guys are using or a generic pic of a molle LBV? Because it's in ICU.. i mean er... ACU. interesting that singapore's gone onto molle systems. Is it produced in-house or made by one of the more well known defense brands? In any case I'd still like to know how it compares to my 5.11 molle vest.</p>
              <p>Btw there is a reason for the mesh system. It's meant to be lighter and more "breatheable" so im interested to know how it causes heat rash.</p>

              <p>follow up on the link, there's a image of SAF trooper in the LBV but i didnt use it as the picture was pretty hard to see.</p>
              <p>yes. ours is this LBV. except its in the traditional olive/dark green drab colour</p>
              <p>suffice to say, sweat + dirt clogs up on the mesh. i dont know exactly how it happens but when we have intensive ops ( which is to say 24-32 hours of continuous action) you'd tend to get it. more so if you involved in alot of training in the open sun for example, engineer training.</p>
              <p>the newer LBVs actually change colour after awhile. apparently some switch in fabric. mine is "1st gen" LBV. dosent change colour. the newer LBVs tend to become stained after a few washes and fades alittle to become light brownish. ESPECIALLY the velcro patches</p>
              <p>the mesh system is nonsense. its supposed to give more area to hang stuff and room to put all the molles gear but it STILL restricts airflow. the old webbing was good. no restriction of airflow as well. but the new LBV effectively doubles the amount of gear we can carry.</p>
              <p>but the new LBV isnt as tough as the old one. old one alot more comfortable as well. the old material in the webbing is nearly as tough as leather. cant cut or tear through. the newer LBV material is lighter and less thick and rugged. tends to get caught on sharp objects as well. with the new LBV, you cant carry alice packs.</p>
              <p>btw, you are residiing in US right ? any chance can ask ya to buy me a surplus alice pack ? very useful for my unit. always short of alice packs</p>

              <p>But thanks for the detailed analysis. It's very much appreciated that you've gone to the effort. I'd have thought that a vest actually increases comfort though. Maybe it's the vest design. Increased load bearing usually shouldn't be an issue if the load is well distributed, so it just seems like there are design flaws. Also the material being not as durable comes as a surprice. Pick up a CIRAS or any offering from BHI, 5.11 or EI and you'll find they're near indestructable. If the material is made from 1000D nylon there should be no reason why it's not as durable. Even cheap repro vests nowadays are made from 1000D!</p>
              <p>Very interesting indeed. I'd be interested to get my hands on one and assess it's performance against my other vests. These are the vests I have, L to R: Viper SADF type assault vest. ACM HK Swat style vest. 5.11 plate carrier molle vest,</p>

              <p>the material is "indestructible" in the sense that it dosent tear . but after less than a year of tender loving care (some call it abuse), my pouches are beginning to fray at the bottom ( i work alot of concertina wires ya see, usually get caught or poked. my no.4 pants are shredded as a result, might not be a good guage of how strong the material is) </p>
              <p>its good material nontheless. but relative to my webbing material, ild pick the webbing material any given day. heavier but it feels tougher. resists abuse as well.</p>
              <p>i personally feel the mesh was a mistake. big huge mega mistake. i hope i do get a BPV issued to me during reservist. we had to wear our LBV over bullet proof vests for certain occasions (which was retarded since we ended up looking ridiculous and the BPVs arent designed for such usage)</p>
              <p>i have absolutely no idea about how the load bearing works but i can tell you one thing. the load/ layout can be tweaked by height/waist adjustments.</p>
              <p>Very comfortable fit. loading if you mean weight distribution is really how you put your pockets/compartments. like i know of some friends who remove the back pouch as you cant carry alice packs with the back pouch. without the back pouch, its a really great piece of kit. you almost dont feel like you are wearing it</p>
              <p>. with the backpouch, it becomes a bit cumbersome. irritating especially during sprinting or rolling on the ground. added pouches are a good thing. more stuff. the added weight isnt though.</p>
              <p>it seems the new BPVs have the pouches mounted directly on them, molles on the armour itself. much more pragmatic. rather than issuing LBV and other stuff.</p>

              <p>er yes. And shamefully I want more <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif">. I can't help it. I shop for vests like other girls shop for LV handbags.</p>
              <p>gee sgstars thats a great and detailed analysis of the LBV. Now I'd really like to get my hands on one and see how it fares for ops in UK climate.</p>

              <p>The vest dosent work well in hot and humid conditions.</p>
              <p>but its great in cool weather/low humidity conditions. i used it in taiwan.</p>
              <p>btw i think you can get it online. the force21 webbie sells it i think.</p>

              <p>interestingly i had a pair of magnum hi-tecs when i was 15. I left those behind in sg, am wearing a brand called Grafters, that has thinsulate in it's material.</p>
              <p>Clotheswise, I either wear a pair of dickie redhawk black overalls for cqb work. For woodlands scenarios, I have either my german flecktarn or my solvenian woodlands camo. Recently I've just gone with a olive tee over fleck bottoms with my HK swat style vest for a para-military look (think south american paramilitary or mercenary)</p>
              <p>head gear varies widely. I have a PASGAT with a flecktarn cover, a black boonie, black beanie, black balaclava, flecktarn cap, slovenian cap etc to choose from. It depends on the specific mission loadout, although i most often wear the black beanie for stealth work.</p>

              <p>hijack the thread abit here.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>anyone watched the movie elite squad ? i was thinking the BOPE (brazilian anti dope elite squad) tactics were very realistic. but makes me wonder how they actually fight urban shootouts in slums and urban sprawl areas. totally havoc. screws up and gives the enemy so many different positions to shoot from or hide from.</p>
              <p>interesting. can anyone explain to me how shotguns are used in CQB as well ? dont shotgun fragments usually spread over a wide area ? wont they hurt hostages as well ?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>nice one 4justice. whats it ? 12 guage with a P-rail mounted ?</p>

              <p>That's a replica of the XM1014, but with pump action instead of semi auto as the real steel version is.</p>
              <p>Fires 3 BBs per shot like the TM shotties, It's basically the XM1014 tactical, which explains the pictany rail yes. Fires 10 shots from a 30 round cartridge which is basically the magazine.</p>
              <p>As for CQB use, it's used for doorway breeching generally, and shotguns don't all have a wide shot spread. shot spread is variously dependent on type of cartridge used and length of barrel.</p>
              <p>As for urban shootouts, yes they are very messy in general. It is quite impossible to avoid being shot since often the enemy can be in an elevated vantage point. Speed and surprise is often the key to avoiding being shot. I've been in enough CQB skirmishes and been the ambusher far too often to know just how easy it is to shoot someone who doesn't realise there's someone hiding in a corner they can't see.</p>
