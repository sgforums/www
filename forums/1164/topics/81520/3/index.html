That is the first cirteria. Second you have to perform well in you SIS(&lt;&lt; cannot remember the name liao) test. And your officer and peers must recommend you to the higher officer. Used to be very easy to get the 3 yrs contract but I though it no longer is available ??????? Anyway you can ask him to check it out. </span> <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"> </div></blockquote>Ok...<br><br>To clarify tt,<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">IPPT and SOC</span>. There seems to be a common misconception that IPPT and SOC has to be passed before selection into OCS. I've seen ppl who have NOT passed SOC and got in. One has to clear IPPT to be certified as graduating from BMT. That is the criteria. So OCS has no criteria which overwrites this basic rule. As for SOC, I'm not too sure about it...Maybe someone in BMT would care to clarify?<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">SIS!??!</span>. It's called the SITest aka Situaional Test. This tests the recruit's judgement of scenarios painted to him, and it really is a litmus test for whether someone is really cut out to lead, or just there to follow instructions.<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Recommendation</span>. Yes. Firstly, during the 3x PC/PS interviews (initial, during and after), you HAVE to state your desire to undergo OCS/sispec training. On top of that, there are the peer  surveys which see how one ranks in his plt, then his coy, then the school. This is because, when all figures are consolidated (SITest Results, Field Camp Results, ATP, SOC, IPPT etc) they will be ranked and the top 1% (I think) will get into OCS, followed by NSPI, SISPEC, etc...</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>from what i can see, the opinion of us Operationally Ready NSmen is "sign on for FARK?!"  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green">  life is prettier without green / blue / white.<br><br>but for a dude fresh out of poly and financially tight, its easy to see why they would want to explore all options.<br><br>ultimately, what we do is offer advice based on our own biased experience... the man has to decide for himself. if he signs and finds it rewarding, cool. if he signs and hates it in there, its his own decision.<br><br>i guess what we've been saying all this while is :<br><br>(a) if money is the only thing, DON'T DO IT. gov't jobs are mostly the same... high basic, LOW INCREMENT. someone in the private sector can exceed that if they are willing to pia... even by selling insurance.<br><br>(b) there are other things to watch out for... its a totally different atmosphere and not everybody can take it... if u meet the wrong boss and the wrong collegues, it can be DAMN demoralising... and u'll be STUCK... but these are concerns u meet in any jobs outside as well so forget it.<br><br>(c) if stability is what he seeks, there's no better place. its a good place to save money and get one's finances together. if THAT is the main aim, just go, work and take the money. don't think so much about what he's missing, or if he could have done better outside... even if he could, the stability may not be there.<br><br>bottom line: tell him to make his careful own decision and LIVE WITH IT. don't ever look back, don't ever regret. life goes on after the contract ends.<br><br></div>

Right now even in the RSAF, you can just sign up, put RSAF as your employer, but if you pass, the RSAF isn't gonna recognise it because you passed without telling them (letting them know will make you go through a whole lot of red tape which i mentioned in the earlier post)... but you can convert later if they choose to recognise it.<br><br>It's like your TP theory exam... multiple choice questions. To pass you gotta score above 75%. Sounds easy? It isn't... sometimes even the "10-yr series" can't cover everything.<br><br>The scoring goes like this:<br>e.g. 50 question paper<br>Correct answer = 2 points<br>Blank answer = -1 point<br>Wrong answer = -2 points<br><br>If that's the paper he wants, tell him to try to join SIA. The starting pay as a trainee is pathetic but in the long run, he just has to work OT... he'll be bringing in lots of cash if that's what he's aiming for.<br><br>Another company would be ST Aerospace, but for this one i think they hire ex-RSAF personnel. Worth a try to get in if SIA doesn't take him in.<br><br>Regarding requirements... SIA takes in ITE grads. I'm sure they take in poly grads too</div>
