And there's transport and bills and insurance.... how do u expect him to stand on his feet with 400 bucks?<br><br>I know he's not feeling good to let me pay also.. thats y he consider signing on too.... i'm one of the factor... but 10 years is a long long time... Mayb i should ask him consider the 3yr contract scheme... but whats the chances of being selected for OCS course? If u r not selected then how... right</div></blockquote>Should definitely be able to save. I juz ORDed 2 years ago and during my time, recruits got only 240 bucks. Now, NS allowance is x2 of what it used to be. And dun forget ur bf will get promoted and get more pay  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"> Especially if ur bf gets attached to a combat unit and spends most of the week in camp, saving should not be a problem as previously mentioned. During NS, we guys like to go out on weekends and cheong and this is when we spend the most money. If your bf can resist the temptation to go expensive places or buy fanciful stuff like motor bikes etc., 400 bucks/mth for one person should be enough.</div>

One will need to sign the contract before he starts schooling at polytechnic. This 9 years of contract includes 3 years of study and 6 years of working after the study. When he ORD, he will be about 25 - 26 years old.<br><br>As years goes, they (SAF) find it hard to recruit people to sign on as regulars. The joint diploma scheme is extended to people who has already finished their 3 years of study. So inorder to get the back pay, they still sign on for 9 years. But they actually only served for 6 years. This is because the SAF needs some "paperwork" for the finance dept to pay out the back pay. The back pay includes all the monthly pay that he should have if he were to sign on 3 years ago. Plus all the 3 years of schools fees that he paid for. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_neutral.gif" alt="Neutral" title="Neutral"><br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_confused.gif" alt="Confused" title="Confused"> So I am not sure what does this 10 years of contract that u mention. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_confused.gif" alt="Confused" title="Confused"> </div></blockquote>The air force doesn't want to give him the joint polytechinic scheme because his results are only average. not that good.<br><br>So they only give him the oppotunity to sign on 7 yrs or 10 yrs contract. 7 years without graduaty, 10 yrs with graduaty</div>

HP Bills? PUB Bills? Internet Bills? Look, these are WANTS. not NEEDS.<br><br>you don't NEED such a high price plan for your handphone. get it downgraded. And frankly $400 is more than enough already. I got less than that as a Lance Corporal and I owned a bike myself during my NS days.  How did i manage to get more money? I was posted as a driver, and i kept driving and driving, volunteered to drive and clock mileage so that i could get the driver's bonus of $150. Even that added up to $490.  Your BF is a poly grad... a 3SG NSF gets way more than that now.<br><br>Look at your lifestyle first. There are alot of WANTS. If you figure out your NEEDS, $300 is enough to survive as a recruit who is still staying in mommy and daddy's home.</div>
