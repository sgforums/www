One does not sign three years including NS, meaning serving an extra 1/2 year after your NS liability. Rather, the 3-yr contract for officer starts from the day he/she commisions and runs for three years after that, making it a total of slightly over 4 years.<br><br>The current scheme for officers is the SAVER scheme.

However his results was not that fantastic.<br><br>He wanted to sign on  with the air force as a senior technician with the Joint Polytechnic scheme as he could get a payback of allowance and school fees. However, the air force says that his results are not good enough for the Joint Polytechnic scheme but still offer him the opportunity to sign on, without the payback.<br><br>1) While he is studying, i had to help him with his finance and it was quite straining for me. If he's going to enlist without signing on, i know life for me is going to be tougher than now. His mother had mentioned that after going to the NS, she will not give him any allowance.<br><br>I know as a gf, i should support him and give him encouagement on whatever decision he makes. Part of me wish he could sign on so that my burden will be lighter, but i don't wish him to sign on for 10 years and and be doing things he dun like just for the sake of the money. I'm in quite a dilemma as i dunno how to give him opinions on this issue.<br><br>I had already told him before if he never sign on, the financial burden would be greater for me but i really dun wan him to put this as a factor into considering<br><br>I know his dreams is not slogging, but making it big. But if he signs on, that means there'll be no chance to venture out on his own anymore.<br><br>How should i encourage him......... what should i tell him... i know what i 'll say will be inclining him to sign on....so i need some advice since i have no knowledge in this aspect of signing on or not...</div></blockquote>For the love of God.. no, no, no, no, noo!</div>

I just feel that as a gf... i should help him as much as i could although sometimes it wears me out. It isn't easy to let go of a relationship....</div>

Regarding your problem...well there is indeed a three year contract scheme for Army officers, and heres the link:<br>http://www.mindef.gov.sg/arc/officer/off_1300.html<br>You can ask your boyfriend to work hard during BMT to go to OCS....but if he refuse to, sign on as a specialist should be fine. For specialist is a 10 years contract, but i hear that you can disrupt after 5 years without having to pay anything.<br><br>BTW tell your boyfriend to be more realistic....want to make it big but still let girlfriend pay for school fees. Sorri for me saying this, but for every successful person he will have to suffer before to become one. My friend bf even signed just to support his family. If he is really wants to venture out tell him to save up his capital first...maybe by signing on or whatever<br><br>If want money signing on army is just one of them...since he has got a dip he can work after his NS rite?</div></blockquote>Thanks for ur compliment....<br><br>Just to clarify i did not pay for his school fees... but since i'm working and he's still studying... most of entertainment fees, like movies etc i'll pay for it...<br><br>I know how tough it is for some1 to sign a bond and discover that they might want something else... I'm one of them. So i dun wan him to follow in my footsteps.</div>
