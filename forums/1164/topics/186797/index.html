            <div class='col-md body'>well 1 of the books i read on the 6 day war was interesting.How during the lead up to the 6 day war, when israel was slowly MOBing it's forces, men just sat around the radio waiting for his code word to be annouced.How some unit managed to get 110% strength because some old discharged soldiers came back. 1 old man was told by the commanding officer that he could only return if he could provide a car and he came back 2 hrs later with a rented car hah.<br>Interesting to say th least</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Israel was saved by the timely warning of impending war by a Mossad spy, who was none other than NasserÂ’s son-in Â–law. His info led to the mobilization of reservists and deployment of armored units to the Golan Heights. And it was these reservists who beat back the massive Syrian tank forces. Without the reservists, the Arabs would have broken into Galilee, and Israel would have had to use nuclear weapons as a last line of defence.<br><br>The role of this spy remains largely unknown and controversial to this day.<br><br>See details :        http://hnn.us/readcomment.php?id=17131</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Six Day War was when the Israelis humbled the Arabs.<br><br>Yom Kippur is when the Arabs turned the tables on the Israelis. At least at thhe beginning. It's really gripping stuff. I have not finshed the book yet. This one is written by an Israeli journalist who covered the war and because this is a recent book, a lot of declassified info is included.<br><br>This writer served in the US army so he knows about combat and how to report it.<br><br>Yom Kippur is what could happen if a country becomes to compacent and look down on its enemies' fighting will. The Arabs in Yom Kippur War mostly fought well and bravely, much to the surprise of the Israelis.<br><br>This war is also a very good account of tank vs anti-tank weapons wielded infantry, which accounted for a great loss of Israeli tanks.<br><br>This book is also about the Israeli completely fcuking up the whole business of defence, intel, operations etc at the beginning of the war.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>In the Yom Kippur book, the author usually neglect to mention the type of tank or APC the Israeli side was using. On the few occasions that he did, he mentioned mostly the Sherman and the Centurion.<br><br>I know that the Sherman was upgrgaded to 105mm gun. Though the Sherman was easy to be destroyed, it did a pretty good job even against Russian T-55 and T-62. The other tank the Arabs were using was the T-34.<br><br>After reading about both the Six Day and Yom Kippur Wars, I have not come across any mention of the AMX-13's performance in IDF. Does any one know of IDF experience with the AMX-13? I understand theirs were converted to 105mm gun.</div>
