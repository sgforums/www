After WW2, they have been periodically taken out of mothballs anfd refurbished when the need arise. In their latest form prior to the last decommissioning, they were fitted with tomahawk cruise missiles with harpoon launcher in the quarterdeck and the last turrent (I may be wrong here) was replaced with a helipad. All this was done for the cost of less than a Perry class frigate in the defense dollars of that era. It was a very cost effective thing to do then and in a way was meant as a response to the introduction of the Soviet Kirov class which can be termed as a modern equivalent of a battlecruiser. The New Jerseys were fast - 30 kts and their armour makes them almost impregnable to modern ASM. What is a harpoon compared to the 18 inch shells of the Japanese battleships which they were meant to engage and survive. And nothing today can ever compared to them in the NGFS role. They are something you would not want to see when you are manning a bunker on the beach  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"> However to build them from scrach again would be impractical - The cost of that as mentioned by other forumers would be prohibitive and let's not even go into the life cycle cost of those things. Do our area of operation require them? They might be impressive in blue water operation but in littoral operations in a area of contested maritime command? You would not want to try to manoeuvre this baby in the Malacca Straits and the Singapore Straits. Let's not even go into the political repercussion of it.
