I guess they are a little bit too much for the police coast guard, since the PCG don't have much use for missiles...

The placement of the howitzer on the roof top would immoblise the 155, leading them vulnerable to counter battery. The fixtion of them would prevent them from being deploy for other missions which are equally important. It would be blazingly obvious to your intention  if you see 155 sprouting up on roof top all over the place. Regarding the floating island concept, this idea is being proposed for as a replacement for the US Kadena Air Force base in Okinawa. It would be prohibitively expensive, would require a high manpower expenditure and they are fixed assets. There are manpower requirements in MINDEF and you cannot just transfer them. From another posting [DefensE cost is crippiling<img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy">STA], surely there are better ways to spend our dollars.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Another addendum to the battle island concept. These mobile bases are not neccessary invulnerable to first strike. You would want to base them a distance not too far from Singapore so as to allow the assets base on them to be usable in a crisis. Looking at the geography of the region, they will probably be within range of any adversary air bases. You would need to invest heavily as well in their defense since they would be isolated outpost and cannot be effectively reinforced. They would turn out to be prime targets for attacks.

            <div class='col-md body'>a battle island or island base would only cause chaos... this will make targeting for any aggressors simple... you have to think of the human factor in this... won't it put the lives of those living under theses batteries at risk? construction of these batteries publicly would upset these people living under these batteries and definately lead to international intervention by all sorts of unions. i definately won't be able to sleep at night knowing that my roof is a possible target for any crazed nation to strike at.<br><br>mobile batteries would make more sense as they're harder to target and can be moved as and when needed. with regards to national security i think we should not get it confused with the showing off of our power.

France puts 90% in SSBNs. Britain intends to have 100%.</div></blockquote>Hello<br><br>Well before I go on, just to clarify that I am obviously not terribly enthusiastic about the battleship and island bases in our context. I guess I did not apply a strict interpretation to the term "mobile". I meant that the mobility is not that of a ship and such and cannot be deployed flexibly. I never did assume that you  mentioned that it would be deployed in the straits. Obviously such platforms can only be deployed in the South China Sea with its proximity to foreign air bases. A large relatively immobile base is of a different visible profile than a SSBN. A submerged SSBN in the Atlantic Ocean is very different from a large Nimitz class size object in the South China Sea. Of course I fully subscribed to the advantage of having a submarine based nuclear deterrent. I am merely stating that the context is different. One possible use of such a platform if I hold your argument of freeing up land space would be to perharps to be used it as an fix extension of a base instead of reclaming from the sea.<br><br>Nothing is 100% defensible; we can only try our best to make it so. A naval base or air base in Singapore at least have the benefit of being under the air defense umbrella  (Ref: various articles in Cyberpioneer and Tim Huxley [Defending the Lion City] A floating base in the South China Sea would be rather isolated in comparison.<br><br><strong>Fighters flying CAP are hell better than SAMs on the ground. Even with "outdated" SAMS even the americans had to go in with their tomahawks, F117s and B2s before they let their F-18s soften the targets futher. </strong> Pardon my ignroance but I do not understand this statement.<br><br><strong>Reinforced? Do you think we can be reinforced in Singapore? </strong> This is a rather contentious issue. The reinforcement I meant in my post was that for example should Changi Naval Base comes under attack, at least it would be under the protection our our air defense umbrella rather than being on its own such as the mobile base that you are mentioning. Whether we as a nation can be reinforced would probably depend on who is reinforcing us. This is my own simplistic view of things. If we are to bring in our assets overseas during hostility in our own transports IE RSAF C130 or Singapore chartered aircraft/RSN LST or Singapore flagged merchant ships, perharps that would be difficult but if it was an American led effort (assuming that the Americans are really such great pals  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_twisted.gif" alt="Twisted Evil" title="Twisted Evil"> ) it would be different. A history of the American reinforcement of Israel during the Yom Kippur War is illuminating in such aspects.<br><br>Such are my humble opinions, please do not get too pissed off with me....please please please  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_neutral.gif" alt="Neutral" title="Neutral"><br></div>

However the Russians and Chinese seems to be believers in a land base alternative as well. A significant portions of the Russian arsenal (This might have change from the Soviet time) seem to be based  in land based mobile launchers (their Strategic Rocket Force) and this apply to the Chinese as well. I am not talking about IRBM or tactical battlefield nuclear weapons but rather strategic nuclear weapons<br>In your opinion, what could be their rationale for the continued use of land base launchers? Could it be a hedging of bets or the reduced complexity and costs of developing and maintaining such systems?<br><br>Regarding your post of the NVN success in blunting American air power, you are right to highlight their success but you have to bear in mind that by the end of Linebacker 2 and Rolling Thunder (the earlier episode), the Americans had achieved virtual air supremacy over North Vietnam. It was political consideration such as the fear of killing Soviet personnel or the fear of Chinese intervenation that prevented them from obliteraing key targets such as Haiphong. A air defense umbrella based on SAM/AA guns alone is also much more vulnerable than an integrated one. Witness the destruction of the Syrians SAM batteries in the Bekaa Valley of Lebanon during the 1982 invasion of Lebanon through the creative use of UAV and innovative EW tactics by the IAF or the gaining of air supremacy over Europe by the Allies through the grounding and attrition of the Luftwaffe. The Flak defenses in the latter case hampered the bomber offensive but did not cause as much a disruption as would have occured had the Luftwaffe strength been preserved.</div>

The % of the arsenal remaining in the US silos was insignificant vis a vis the % of the Soviet arsenal in the mobile launchers. Air Force planners of that era were aware of the tremendous casaulties and difficulties of executing their nuclear mission should a nuclear war break out. How could the B52 and others penetrate the Soviet air defense after their less than expected performances against the NVN air defenses. Then again, I am in general agreement with your assesement of the hedging of bets via land based launchers. Some minor points of contention: a massive pre emptive strike would not knock out all the SSBN.  I could imagine why the Chinese would want to develope a land based alternative. Their current Xia class SSBN probably would not survive in a heavy ASW environment against the USN and their operation in a "protected bastion" such as the Yellow Sea would probably have to depend on the ability of the PLAN to protect such a bastion - a rather risky strategy in view of the USN superiority. Hence a land based alternative would in contrary to western dogma be a safer bet</span><br>While im not intimately familiar with the Vietnam war, i do know that a COMPLETE air defense complex, such as was possible during the Cold War, virtually ensures your base's survival.

That was in the Yom Kippur War of 1973 when the Egyptians and Syrians constructed a dense air defense barrier over the Suez Canal and the Golan Heights. They exacted such a toll on the IAF that the IAF were forbiddened to operate within 15 miles of the Canal. It was only after the IDF ground forces punched holes in the barrier by destroying the ground sites that the barrier was significantly breached, restoring the IAF freedom of operation. However the same system did operate during the Vietnam War and the Americans were able to overcome it. This being a relatively comtemporary event of the Yom Kippur War leads us to infer that should the Israelis possesed the brute force of the Americans - who have the luxury of being able to devote substantial air assets to SEADS/Wild Weasel sorties, the air defense barrier would probably have been overcome. There is no instance (pardon my ignorance if I am wrong) of a truly invulnerable air defense barrier. Whether the Soviet Air Defense system would constitute such an invulnerable barrier would fortunately have to be a thereotical speculation</span><br><br></div>
