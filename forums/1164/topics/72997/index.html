            <div class='col-md body'><strong>Straits Times</strong><br>MARCH 15, 2004<br>Malaysia's National Service trainees on riot<br><br>KUALA LUMPUR -- Hundreds of trainees of Malaysia's first national service call-up took part in a weekend of riots after four of their colleagues were beaten up by camp officials, state media reported on Monday.<br><br>Police quoted by the Bernama news agency said the violence erupted late on Sunday in Sarawak, east Malaysia, after a heated row between three medical staff of the national service programme and two trainees.<br><br>Mr Stanley Jonathan Ringgit, the Bintulu deputy police chief, said the situation worsened when two other trainees, who rushed to the aid of their friends, were also beaten up by the three staff believed to be drunk.<br><br>He said four trainees received outpatient medical treatment.<br><br>During the incident, the trainees threw stones, damaged chairs and smashed up the windscreen of a car, Bernama reported. Police were called in to bolster security and restore order to the camp, which houses some 600 trainees.<br><br>More than 28,000 youths began the national service training on Feb 16.<br><br>The government says the objective of the RM500-million (US$132 million) pilot programme is to build a generation of self-confident, patriotic youths with noble values and develop multiracial harmony and unity.<br><br>The programme does not involve weapons handling but physical training includes unarmed military-style exercises such as basic self-defence and jungle survival skills. -- AFP<br><br>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>Copyright @ 2004 Singapore Press Holdings.
