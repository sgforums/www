            <div class='col-md body'>SpecOps87 I am realistic. IMO it <strong>IS</strong> possible for some nut to excute his crazy terrorist plans, <strong>BUT</strong> it certainly wouldn't be easy at all.<br><br><strong>Lets face the true and blunt facts here alright,look at those NS men deployed at Airports,Seaports,Jurong Island Checkpoints.Do they look the slightest bit alert to you?They look anything but alert to me.</strong><br><br>I know that the NSF performing POI at the major installations are not the most motivated bunch. I've done it before too, damn boring <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_evil.gif" alt="Evil or Very Mad" title="Evil or Very Mad">.  but they are effective as a 1) deterant to make them scared to attempt anything and 2) reactive force to contain the damage (untested, but there are lots of contingency plans in place).<br><br>Furthermore with the hike in airline security in the 911 incident, it's impossible (or damn near impossible) to bring in weapons like guns through the airport when even metal forks and spoons are prohibited. It would be hard to bring out of their own country in the first place. In the case of "hot" countries, incoming flights from those places are either prohibited or specially marked. So sad to say, our guys there are for show only. If anything they're just there to make the tourists feel safer that's all.<br><br><strong>Let me ask you this,what if the materials are brought in with the help of foreign missions and thus such items have what we call diplomatic immunity.And 2,what if its conducted by our very own crazed and highly trained and equipped people?</strong><br><br>I've yet to hear of Singapore allowing other countries to bring in their own explosives to train in Singapore. Heck i've never even heard of any country training on our ground with live ordinance. It's always our troops that go overseas, not the other way round as there is simply no ground to maneuver with live firing on a large scale. In the case of black sheep in our midst, I feel that if they don't have the equipment, they can't deal significant damage. Besides, how do you think the govt unveiled the first crop of local JI members? We have agencies working 24/7 to uncover them.<br><br><strong>imagine one fine day some tango equipped with a couple of RPGs or ATGMs together with a good buddy of his,floating off shore from Bukom.He takes sight and send a friggin' RPG or ATGM aimed directly at one of those big round fuel containers,what have you got?<br><br>Next Changi Airport,if there are some tango who's armed with say a Stinger,Red-eye or Igla man-portable SAM and decides to strike one of the 747s coming in to land at our world class airport, and fate has it that the bastard succeeds and down the 747 comes,what are we ever gonna do man?I really wonder. </strong><br><br>Watch one too many movies lately? When was the last time you heard of a shooting incident in Singapore? And now you're talking RPGs, ATGMs and Stingers. How do you suppose your "tangos" get hold of those weapons? You have idea how heavily patroled the Bukom is?<br><br>In the case of foreign armies launching a suprise attack from within, do you really think the govt would allow a foreign army waltz into our land TOGETHER with their big weapons loaded, even from a supposely friendly force ?!?! How do you propose they get those weapons + ammo out of whichever base they're stationed at ?<br><br><strong>Make them (explosives), they have the standard issue osama handbook , which can be found in internet. Make is not too hard, someone with a little physic knowledge can follow easily only. But need to make huge amount which mean a long time. </strong><br><br>What's the difference b/w Singapore and the US or any country that suffered acts of terrorism ? Singapore is a very small country and nothing much escapes the eyes of our govt. Do you think the buying of chemicals that can make bombs can go unoticed by the ISA? Even if you buy it in small amounts periodically so as not to arouse suspicion, it will probably take decades to make a big bang (for the lack of a better phrase) unless all you want to blow up is a parking lot. Not to mention you need some kind of permit to buy the "essentials". Bottomline is, the govt agencies knows a lot more than you think they do.<br><br>But our people do need to be more vigilant and aware of their surroundings instead of relying on the govt agencies to do the dirty work all the time. The average citizen would ignore everything and get on with their lives because of complacency and false sense of security we have been lulled into. While terrorist acts happening in our land is not impossible, there IS still the possibility, only a improbable one.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Explosive ingredent need not have to be fertilizers &amp; as for detornator, anyone with electrical engineering &amp; knowledge of eaplosive will know that its not a problem to set off a bomb.  However, I would agreed that most bombers are not very creative, which is why our authorities only clampdown on large quantity purchase of fertilizers. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_eek.gif" alt="Shocked" title="Shocked"><br><br>I guess suicide bombing is the most obvious choice, cause its supposed to have a strong hidden terror message to it, mentally.

            <div class='col-md body'>BTW, remember the American shoe bomber ( almost ) aka dirty bomber, John Walker?  His shoe bomb contained dirty nuclear atoms &amp; his detonating device was going to be the fire from his zippo lighter. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_neutral.gif" alt="Neutral" title="Neutral"><br><br>Anyway, if bombing isn't going to be the terrorist21 ( Army21) ways, what about Electro Magnatic Pulse ( EMP )?  The whole country will go back to the stone age without the suicide bomer.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_eek.gif" alt="Shocked" title="Shocked"></div>
