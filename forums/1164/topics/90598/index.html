Terrorists going around afixing PE (plastic explosive) to key structural points, and no one notices in a crowded area ?!  Even if they don't, major shopping centers employ security guards that have probably been briefed about this kind of scenarios after the 911 incident. And contrary to what's in the movies, riggging explosives isn't that easy. IMO it's kinda hard to do remote detonation in the city due to the emission from HPs. The detonator might go off the moment the bugger uncovers it, killing him but failing to trigger the PE.<br><br>Even if the recent "test" run by the govt shows that singaporean are oblivious to these terrorism threats, things like "afixing ball bearing to charges" are way to blatent to miss. There are lots of specs/officers and even men that have been trained by the army in basic explosives that could recognise this threat.<br><br>Our Underground tunnels probably have automated fire control mechanisms (ie sprinklers) that can contain most fires until CDF reaches the scene. I'm only guessing here but I don't think govt would build a tunnel w/o thinking of that. In any case, it's rather hard to get a oil tanker in the first place ? Law also decrees that no vehicle(s) carrying flammable/explosive/chemical ordinance are allowed to enter tunnels. Furthermore an uncountable number of cameras are installed on all major expressways, and they are monitored 24/7. With this system it's possible to trace any vehicle that has been "marked" as dangerous and stop it.<br><br>*****<br><br>Having said that, I feel that it's possible to sneak underground and set up explosives to weaken the foundation of building sufficiently to cause it to collapse.<br><br>Also possible is the classic lone luggage/bag with a timed explosive inside that the MRT stations/trains announcements every 10 minutes are warning us about. Too many people are simply too bo chap and ignore all these things. Place them in a library/school and it's 10 times worse. There are students leaving bags around all the time and no one really cares.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>meander,please be realistic.You really honestly think that our customs and security checks are that secure?Let me ask you this,what if the materials are brought in with the help of foreign missions and thus such items have what we call diplomatic immunity.And 2,what if its conducted by our very own crazed and highly trained and equipped people?<br><br>Lets face the true and blunt facts here alright,look at those NS men deployed at Airports,Seaports,Jurong Island Checkpoints.Do they look the slightest bit alert to you?They look anything but alert to me.Seriously,I have witnessed the earlier batch holding their weapons with their f**king fingers in the f**king trigger guard whilst on patrol,does that make you a wee bit safe?Lets face it,no matter how secure a place is,no matter how unknown the place is,no matter how good and strong you security and defence forces are,if someone is willing to take up the challange and rise up to the challange,they will try whatever ways and means to accomplish their goals regardless of the costs,simply due to that fact that they are all determined and have nothing to lose.<br><br>The 21st century Modern terrorist/insurgents/rebels we face are people who have fixed objectives and are willing to be scarficed for their cause.Lets put this out to all the military people,regulars and NSFs,what do they want.A peaceful and calm environment.But these tangos are not,they are seeking a whole new revolution and as such have a reason.I even hear of NSFs saying that the friggin 2 yrs they spend are just a waste of time and is a time for slacking.I certainly feel very very sorry for the country when I hear that.Although I must definitely agree that there are people who are willing to lay down their lives for the nation,but how many are really willing to do so in a heartbeat?<br><br>Another food for thought,realise that Pulau Bukom is a highly combustible island as its an oil refinery,imagine one fine day some tango equipped with a couple of RPGs or ATGMs together with a good buddy of his,floating off shore from Bukom.He takes sight and send a friggin' RPG or ATGM aimed directly at one of those big round fuel containers,what have you got?A chain reaction being set off.And how are our defence forces able to prevent that?I have no idea what maesures are in place,but I do suggest that they throw a "no-go"zone around the island and have it patrolled regularly.Also related,we often see those oil tankers bringing fuel to be refined or taking on fuel at Bukom,so what if our tango bastards manage to hijack one of these,plant a friggin' bomb on it sail towards the port and KABOOM it?We have another diasater.Solution?Allow only registered ships to berth at Bukom,and before breaching the "no-go" zone,have navy,coast guartd,NDU,SOF,CDO personnel board and carry out an inspection and escort the ship in,so that if it tries any hanky panky business,they can be tackled immediately.<br><br>Next Changi Airport,if there are some tango who's armed with say a Stinger,Red-eye or Igla man-portable SAM and decides to strike one of the 747s coming in to land at our world class airport, and fate has it that the bastard succeeds and down the 747 comes,what are we ever gonna do man?I really wonder.<br><br>The above scenarios are very very real and could happen to any countrey in the world.So I do hope that the authorities see this posting and take the revalent precautionary measures.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>"How the heck are you going to get all the explosives needed given that : internally, explosive ordinance is very tightly controlled; and externally, all entry points to Singapore Aiport/Causeway/TMFT all have those specially trained dogs to sniff out explosives ?"<br><br><strong>Make them, they have the standard issue osama handbook <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile">, which can be found in internet. Make is not too hard, someone with a little physic knowledge can follow easily only. But need to make huge amount which mean a long time.</strong><br><br>"Your City scenario is a little unrealistic. Terrorists going around afixing PE (plastic explosive) to key structural points, and no one notices in a crowded area ?!  Even if they don't, major shopping centers employ security guards that have probably been briefed about this kind of scenarios after the 911 incident. And contrary to what's in the movies, riggging explosives isn't that easy. IMO it's kinda hard to do remote detonation in the city due to the emission from HPs. The detonator might go off the moment the bugger uncovers it, killing him but failing to trigger the PE. "<br><br><strong>Well things are often go un-notice, so cannot say never. Remote Detonation is not hard, a lot of stuff can be use to convert to the trigger device. The only thing is the huge amount of self-make explosive is needed, that mean must be a vehicle.</strong><br><br>"Our Underground tunnels probably have automated fire control mechanisms (ie sprinklers) that can contain most fires until CDF reaches the scene. I'm only guessing here but I don't think govt would build a tunnel w/o thinking of that. In any case, it's rather hard to get a oil tanker in the first place ? Law also decrees that no vehicle(s) carrying flammable/explosive/chemical ordinance are allowed to enter tunnels. Furthermore an uncountable number of cameras are installed on all major expressways, and they are monitored 24/7. With this system it's possible to trace any vehicle that has been "marked" as dangerous and stop it. "<br><br><strong>For a vehicle with flammable/explosive..... to suddenly go wrongly onto the road to tunnel, can happen. Don't think there is time or way to stop it on time.</strong></div>
