              <p>We all know that Singapore is a little red dot. So, its resources is limited and its neighbours not very friendly. Some people may disagree with me in this but I think the rest will agree. So, we must defend it at all costs.</p>
              <p><br>However, if the enemy were to attack, we will most probably still worry right? This is because while we are fighting in the front, our families back home are threatened. Enemy war planes will fly to Singapore and bomb it and enemey missiles will fly and hit it.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>So, do you think you will feel better when you are fighting the battle upfront that your family is far far away, maybe in Australia? When you are fighting the enemy in the battlefield, your family is sleeping in Australia or Canada and having a party.  Do you think this is a better way of fighting? Then you need not worry whether enemy planes bomb your flat or bomb your housing estate.</p>
              <p> </p>

              <p><br>that s fantasy.good as finding gold nuggets in kallang river.</p>
              <p>the proximity from spore to neighboring countries warrant a massive artillery barrage lasting for 3 hrs or more destroying on  all spore urban areas.dont forget that the enemy would be invading and not spore invading so the enemy would have pointed like 70 over artillery guns at all the buildings in spore and amassed enough to cause damage in spore.by the time spore mobilised forces it would be too late as trains would have been struck,trainlines demolished,roads will be destroyed,people will be panicking,all major buildings will be destroyed.</p>
              <p>you would be lucky u dont get killed on way back to report n collect arms from army camp from artillery shelling each central town location.and how do u get to camp without a train?car?u rich enough ?bicycle?</p>
              <p>and which taxi wants to do business when entire roads and towns are being shelled and craters created everywhere and demolishings roads?u going to offer taxi $100 to get to your camp?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>perhaps u could run back to camp which is 10km or so away from u since theres no mrt train and working train tracks and taxis and cars.best u ride a bicycle back to camp 10km away in middle of artillery firing  and exploding everywhere in spore.</p>
              <p>somehow the generals hadnt thought of everything.</p>

              Itedino, that was what the Japs did in WWII and I suspect it'll work as well now as then, which means that the SAF needs to do a breakout and prevent any blockade from forming. Easier said than done though. Which is why the standard SAF doctrine is preemptive assault  and forward defence.
              
              BTW, 3 hr shelling is impractical unless you did a LOT of prep work before hand with logistics, the kind that can be detected by recon plane and sat easily. Hitman's too pessimistic. Besides, with today's precision munitions, anyone wasting an expensive round on random roads and not a military target is going to get his ass reamed by his OC.

              <p>and why is a 3hr impossoble.to destroy n cripple a country for a decade.that is the cheapest way.theres the train stations,train visducts at 10 points,cbd,so many goody places to shell artllery for 3 hrs.</p>
              <p>if enemy is determined to invade n destroy spore....3 hr artillery shelling in prime areas is a basement bargain effort.</p>
              <p>artillery rounds are not precision.its old fashioned cheap dumb ammo.cheaper than sending a battalion out to invade even.</p>
              <p>anyway no one would be returning in 3hrs of shelling to army camp directed also at residential areas n bus depots n mrt stations.then what???stuck at home???army camp 10km away.</p>

              <p>Itedino, that was what the Japs did in <span>WWII</span> and I suspect it’ll work as well now as then, which means that the <span>SAF</span> needs to do a breakout and prevent any blockade from forming. Easier said than done though. Which is why the standard <span>SAF</span> doctrine is preemptive assault and forward defence.</p>
              <p><span>BTW</span>, 3 hr shelling is impractical unless you did a <span>LOT</span> of prep work before hand with logistics, the kind that can be detected by recon plane and sat easily. Hitman’s too pessimistic. Besides, with today’s precision munitions, anyone wasting an expensive round on random roads and not a military target is going to get his ass reamed by his OC.</p>

              Well, this proves Hitman was never in an arty unit.
                  
              You want 3 hr shelling, you got to carry 3 hrs worth of 155mm shells per gun. 6 guns per battery, 40 rounds per hour sustained, 240x3 = 720 rounds at 43kg each = 30,960kg. 
              (Using the US M102 round) NOT including propellent charge addons.
                  
              Approximately 30 tons of shells per battery. And people have to HAUL it to the gun and not just have it sit in the 3 tonner. With your 70+ guns, it's ~2.1 MILLION tons and lots of 3-tonners. And 100+ 3-tonners running around is a VERY obvious target. And using 2 megatons of shells on non-military targets is an obvious waste, especially when said military units are going to climb up your ass when you start shelling.
                  
              And I've to really ask you Hitman, you talk about arty, but do you KNOW what the range of a 155mm is? It's not as long ranged as you think, so the area to deploy 100 guns is incredibly limited. And area needs to be clear too, don't want your shell to hit a tree going out. That limits deployment areas. So, NO, there are NOT 100 guns sitting in Johor City aimed at Singapore.

              <p>There's also the super-old Mod 56 105mm but I don't think the tubes can sustain a 3 hr bombardment. Agreed, no MY arty units within range of Singapore. MY 3 Div + 2RAD/61 RAD are located in Johor though.</p>
              <p>The math needs to be corrected though. Its only 31 tons for a 6 gun bty. 60 guns = 310 tons or 310,000 kg. Charges are about 12.92 kg per charge. Further range = more charges needed (max for 155mm charge 8?). Also fuzes needed at ~1.5kg per fuze.</p>
              <p>What I like about SG is pallet containerisation. 8x155mm shell pallet = 355kg. Charge pallet = 48 charges = 620 kg. Fuze pallet = 600 fuzes = 920 kg. So every 8 rounds ~1 ton. 7200 rounds roughly requires 900+ tons. Each container carries 20-30 tons so its 30-50 container trucks worth. SG got over 4000+ container trucks in commercial service.</p>
              <p>SG-MY not going to fight one another (except on the football field).</p>

              <p>there is also the issue of sustained firing for 3 hour.</p>
              <p>despite modern metallurgy, its not possible to maintain a 3 hour continuos fire, unless you are firing at the rate of 1 round every 2+ minutes.</p>
              <p>unfortunately.... given modern counter battery technology and response time... the enemy artillery position would be swamped with counter fire within 2 minutes.</p>
              <p>furthermore, there is the issue of wear and tear, artillery barrels needs to be changed based on manufacturer reccomendations, usually a barrel change is needed every 500 rounds.</p>
              <p>singapore have the advantage that we manufacture the artillery barrels locally, so we have no problem in sustaining the number of artillery pieces we have in war at a constant level, our neighbours are not as fortunate.</p>
              <p>lastly, singapore also have the advantage of ICM shells, each ICM round splits into 64 sub-munitions to cover a wider area, increasing the effectiveness of our shells.</p>
              <p>assuming a rapid 3 (under 20 seconds) and scoot from a battery of 6 FH-2000.</p>
              <p>3(rounds)x6(guns)=18 rounds</p>
              <p>18(rounds)x64(sub munition)=1152 bomblets!!</p>
              <p>according to wiki, singapore has about 300 155mm guns, if they all use ICM doing a rapid 3.</p>
              <p>in 20 seconds, singapore artillery can dish out a massive 57,600 bomblets against the enemy. that is more bomblets then the number of malaysian soldier in johor.</p>

The flight test was carried out on November 30, 2011, at the White Sands Missile Range in New Mexico using Lockheed Martin's new Guided Multiple Launch Rocket System-Plus (GMLRS+). As the name suggests, the scalable effects warhead allows the user to select the explosive yield of the weapon depending on the nature of its intended target.</p>
              <p>The November 2011 flight test saw the GMLRS+ rocket score a direct hit on a target 30 miles (49 km) away.
