              <p>In the army, we often experience a stupid exercise whereby we are forced to drink excessive water in a very short period of time. I remember during my time in the police academy, the night before we are going for a long run, we are forced to drink way way excessive of water and anyone not drinking will not be able to book out on Sat. What the morons did not realise is that we can get water poisoning due to excessive drinking of water due to their moronic exercise. Thank god I didn't follow that idiot exercise by pouring away the water to water the grass. Should they abolish or should they carry on this exercise which can cause death?</p>

              <p>1 litre or 500ml wun kill you, you need to drink quite a bit more before you get water intoxication.</p>
              <p>For new recruits they need to get used to hyrdrating properly before they can self-regulate, hence the whole idea of water parade. There will be some dudes that simply do not know the importance of hydration and very often by the time they actually feel thirsty they could be close to heat exaustion. Heat stroke is no joking matter, and we get heat injuries every year, and no cases of water intoxication that I know of yet.</p>
              <p>Nothing to say about those dudes who ask you to drink 3 litres of water, that one is obviously stupid.</p>

              <p>Hey, at least it's better than some armies where recruits are <strong>discouraged</strong> to drink water.</p>
              <p>In the Korean Army where I served my NS, recruits are discouraged to drink water by their NCOs and stupid sh!t like that. I suppose the purpose is to "toughen up" the pukes and instill fear in them. Hah! Maybe such training is appropriate for elite units who are preparing to serve in a desert environment or something like that, but I always thought it was foolish and dangerous for <em>recruit</em> training, and only served the egos of the NCOs.</p>
              <p>The only result that I could see were people fainting and collapsing. Fortunately, I had enough sense to disobey orders and secretly sip some water when I thought they weren't looking. (I'm SO evil...bwahahaha. I guess I'm just not "soldier material").</p>
              <p>But I got to agree that drinking 3 litres of water is pretty stupid, too. But then again, an Army (of any nationality) is not known to be led (or followed) by the brightest minds.</p>

              <p>Aiyah.... if it's one mess mug only, then it's okay mah....</p>
              <p>Here's a tip: eat one piece of dry biscuit prior to water parade. This will help your body absorb the water better.</p>
              <p>I have to agree that three liters is overkill, though. Whoever thought of that sure has a vacuum in his skull.</p>

              <p>the best way to hydrate is to take small amounts consistenly over a long period to be hydrated. its sad SAF dun know that, Taking a massive amount of water isnt exactly effective in hydrating and only produces discomfort.</p>
              <p>my say is that they should let recuits OTOT, hydrate at frequ intervals, and not like after 2-3 hours, and expect the recuits to be water carriers</p>
