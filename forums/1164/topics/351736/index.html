              <p>why would SG govt need a private jet when they can just charter 1 SIA plane?</p>
              <p>That would help SIA in their profits, which would in turn help TH's portfolio, and at the same time save resources for storing an extra jet somewhere. And save resources to maintain the plane...</p>
              <p>And if a private jet is undergoing maintenance, no one can use it; they wouldn't face this problem as well for chartered planes. It would be much like Warren Buffett's private jet company... Pooling resources...</p>

              <p>That's a Gulfstream, definitely not a Fokker 50. F50 is a high wing twin turboprop, which your picture shows. The Gulfstream jet is a low wing twin jet, and the window arrangement and type denotes it to be a Gulfstream jet. Who knows, maybe the sultan sent his personal gulfstream over to pick up the MM</p>

              <p>I am just wondering, with our 1st Phalcons delievered here only last month. The order for the Training G550 was less than 6mths ago. And, they were able to get the plane flying within such a short time span ??? <br><br>And also, from the 2nd link that TS had given us, it states that "the deal
              will deliver flying training services and instructors from 2012 using a G550 business jet to be acquired and maintained by ST Areo." It ain't 2012 yet, i guess.</p>
              <p>From wiki, The Sultan of Brunei operates a G-IV. Its reference link was this:<br><a href="http://jeteditor.com/tjsult.htm">http://jeteditor.com/tjsult.htm</a><br><br>Its last second paragraph says "<span style="font-family: Verdana,Arial; color: #000000; font-size: x-small;">the Sultan of Brunei, has been an influence of sorts in the 
              		final selection of His Majesty's aircraft. Currently, the Brunei Royal 
              		fleet includes an Airbus 320, a Boeing 757, a Gulfstream III and IV, a 
              		Sikorsky S70 and a S76 MK2."<br></span></p>
              <p>So, I guess, we can conclude that was a Gulfstream IV in that photograph. Not the supposedly G550. Furthermore, that photograph cannot determine whether it was a G550, G-III or G-IV. <br><br>Relax, even our G550 were to fly on official business for the government of Singapore, I dun see a need to create a woohaa on it. Unless u are telling me that (one day, for example) they used it for their shopping trip to HK ...</p>

              <p>Actually you might be right, the plane in the shot is likely to be a Gulfstream IV, as evident by the 6 window arrangement. The G550 has 7 windows. Could well be the Sultan's personal aircraft sent to pick up the MM.</p>
              <p>I guess it's fairly routine that governments acquire private jets to transport head of states, it's just that the purchase of such a jet in the current economic climate would be sure to raise some eyebrows.</p>

              <p>Standard VIP travel is Fokker,KC-135/ C-130s and our other transport/utility crafts. Please dont create new account just to stir political crap on milnuts forum.</p>
              <p>The 5th G550 is to train nub pilots and keep all current pilots up to date with the handling of a business jet that flies fast, high and long.  Can you imagine a noob pilot flying our CAEW?  Having an empty G550 for practice and training is a prudent and sensible decision while clocking the stick time required to keep our eyes in the sky at top capability.</p>
              <p>So -what- if the MIW decide to fly in the G550? It's more fuel efficient, it's comfortable, and if it is an efficient use of resource, it makes sense.  An empty G550 is more expendable (and cheaper) than a KC-135 on a long haul flight eh? As long as the plane dont get shot down, we get to keep our international reputation, it's okay.</p>
              <p>That's more important now than the politiking that you are trying to stir.</p>

              <p>ahh , i see, i thought you were referring to PM Lee and his recent trip to hua hin for the ASEAN summit on the fokker F50.</p>
              <p>i had no idea you were referring to the senoir MM Lee. my apologies for the mistaken identity.</p>
              <p>if you did checkout the picture, you'd have seen PM Lee and not the MM.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>CMO6, i disagree with your position. albiet the intention may be suspect, but as an elected government, the government is, to a certain degree, held accountable to the electorate. our constitution allows for conditional free speech you know.</p>
              <p>they are not above and beyond criticism nor are they subject to preferential laws. they are just human beings in top jobs. they arent beyond reproach of your joe "tigerbeer" sixpack here in singapore. just have to be careful we dont slander anyone.

              <p>Seems like you know a lot about jet training. So explain to me why when the RSAF had their 4 E-2C Hawkeyes, there was no dedicated training airplane, maybe a stripped down platform minus the radar equipment? Those airplanes were equally as expensive and specialised as the G550 AEW platforms are they not? </p>

              <p>How can u say SG already own a G 550 without investigations.</p>

Chances are, he didn't know a thing till i pointed it out. <br><br>I guess, the lack of a training aid for our E-2C is because of the fact that it was a turboprop aircraft. Despite differences, there are similar turbopros such as Fokker50 and C130. I am not sure, but they probably had a turboprop training aid for turboprop platforms (regardless of model) ?? While that the G550 had no similar training platform ( I guess the TA-4SU is way too different from a G550 jet cockpit) . This just my guess and hypothesis. Maybe someone would like to come in and explain the true difference ...</p></div>

              <p>I am absolutely bemused at how you can critisise Australia for
              having two BBJs. I don't like politicians, but I'm sure most people
              agree that the leader of a larger nation like Australia
              deserve to arrive with dignity. They represent the nation for god's
              sake!</p>
              <p>As for Singapore and the c-130? It's your loss really. Many
              nations have private planes for their leaders.</p>
              <p>At least with Australia, it also can serve as an AAR in times of
              need.</p>
              <p>And you say that Oz is not so rich? Where did you get that
              from?</p>
              <p>I've said it many times, but you are a dimwitted fool
              embarrassing your own country.</p>
              <p>I've been to SG and I'd like to argue one point, why doesn't
              Singapore covers it's drains?</p>

              <p>LOL... did i just fail my maths or did i see lionnoisy attempting to justify a 115% of  GDP  public debt  held by sg as better than a 15% of GDP public debt held by australia ?</p>
              <p>either 2+2 =3 and im seeing flying pigs outta the window.</p>
              <p>congratulations lionnoisy, u never fail to dissapoint. a new level of self pwn. you only need 1 post only and to make yourself look like sheer stupidity. dont even need people to point that out to you.</p>
              <p>i wonder whats next, you smashing your head into a computer monitor before you start posting </p>
