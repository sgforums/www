            <div class='col-md body'>yes, the man on the radio mentioned F-86 Sabres, but what actually did the spectacular bombing and strafing runs were F4U Corsairs. great observation, i did'nt notice the discrepancy myself in the show.<br><br>there MAY have indeed been a sequence where F-86s did a flypast or a bomb run though. i seem to have some vague memories of these, although i know my memory likes to play tricks on me....<br><br>just bear in mind that movie directors VERY OFTEN do not get their military-related details right. i must say though that the movie was otherwise surprisingly accurate in terms of the military equipment used....</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>The part where the Marine pilots taunted the Japs really did happen if you read the historical books. It went something like Pappy Boyington on the radio saying to the effect "Come on up you yellow bastards!" whilst flying over a Jap base with the Jap fighters still on the ground and the Jap replied back "Why don't you come down Major Boyington" all in plain English. Radio security is a funny thing as even my friend's father has described how during the Konfrontasi time, each side was listening in to each other's tactical radio messages (Malay regiment versus Indonesian soldiers).<br><br>There was one time when Saburo Sakai, Jap ace, did aerial aerobatics over an American airbase with another Jap pilot.<br><br>And yes I agree Thunderbolts were one of the most understated aircraft. I guess ugly aircraft  like the Jug didn't get as much credit as clean lines Mustangs even though they were used extremely well by the Allied European Theatre aces. Still in the Pacific Theatre, it was the P-38 Lightnings which did major gruntwork. Corsairs are still my favourite WW2 fighter next to the Focke-Wulf 190 Doras.<br><br>One question, were Spads already available and deployed during the Korean conflict (the piston engine aircraft you almost always see in Vietnam war flicks)?<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by panzerjager:</div><div class="quote_body">So the Koreans were like Black Sheep Squadron in the movie....?

Yes I was referring to the Doug Skyraider an ugly (at least to me) but very effective plane.<br><br>Off-topic, think I'll be leaving military nuts forums since the current posts have been, to my mind, a lot of pure drivel actually. What happened to all the nice intelligent posters whom always had interesting things to say and definitely almost always learnt something new (and some hilarious stuff). It seems as if it's degenerating to the "whose imaginary long dong is bigger" arguments again.<br><br>There's also more NS stuff going around which isn't exactly what I thot military nuts was about. I ORDed in '96 so forgive me if all this whining about NS stuff is tiresome since I've heard it all before and did it myself almost a decade ago. I'm going back to the NNTP newsgroups and some other forums.<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by I_am_PeTe_Parker:</div><div class="quote_body">The first thing that came to mind when SPAD are mention is WW1 biplane.<br>But I guest you are actually refering to the Douglas Skyraider A-1 which is sometimes nicknamed SPAD.
