As with any volunteer army in a free economy, they have to contend with the private sector for recruitments from a finite labour pool.<br><br>When times are bad and unemployment is high, the Armed Forces rarely has a problem filling it's billets.  When times are good and the economy is booming, as is Australia's now, the Armed forces has to compete with the private sector for it's personnel ... IMO, this is where the bulk of their problem is stemming from right now.  The minerals boom in WA is sucking up a lot of their HR at the moment.<br><br>Unfortunately, this is a problem that will confront any Armed Forces not just the Aussies.  The SAF will be in a similar position were it to rely on an all volunteer force.<br><br>Easy enough to laugh at a soci-economic problem that afflicts all free market economies.  Now if the noisy lion will like to try his hands at coming up with workable solution that won't blow the budget, I'm sure there is a CDF position (or at least a G1 position) open somewhere for him.<br><br><strong>2) The issues of flaws with the Collins Subs</strong><br><br>The exposition of this issue in the Australian media is a mix of (a bit of) facts and a whole lot of political agenda.  People who have spent their whole life in the sanitised political environment of Singapore sometimes do not have any idea how "dirty" politics can get overseas.<br><br>Yes, there were build problems with the 1st boat in the Collins fleet but these have been resolved.  The Collins fleet is now functioning as it should and in some areas have exceeded design parameters.  The forthcoming Combat Systems upgrade will likely make them the best (on paper) conventional sub class in the world.<br><br>Talking about shooting yourself in the foot, it is rather apt that lionnoisy has quoted a report that if he had bothered to read would have shown to him that the problems with the Collins were more political than actual.<br><br>Even if noisylion had not bothered to read that far, if he had just made it to page 4 it can be seen that the main thrust of the report was to ...<br><br><blockquote>"Analyse how the projectÂ’s realisation has been detrimentally affected by its manipulation in Australian domestic politics.<br><br>Concurrently I demonstrate how during the construction course the Collins project was captive of a change in broader foreign and defence policy orientation between the two governments who assumed responsibility for its creation and delivery.<br><br>Whilst the project was initiated during an era of the ALPÂ’s promotion of a more independent policy posture, after its election in 1996 the Coalition prioritised its bilateral relationship with the US. The policy divergence between these two postures manifested themselves in the tangible tensions surrounding the delivery of the Collins submarines."</blockquote>For the unintiated, the Collins project straddles a change in the ruling party where the Australian Labour Party (ALP) was replaced by the Liberal Party Coalition in 1996.  Kim Beasly, who was the ALP Defense Minister who initiated the Collins project mid 1980s also happens to be the Leader of the ALP contesting against the Liberals round about the time the "problems" with the Collins were first politicised in the period leading up to the early 2000s.<br><br>Hence to quote Lionnoisy's report,<br><br><blockquote>"This politicisation of the project also served another function in addition to the denigration of Beazley Labor. By disregarding the action already in position to address any deficiency in the submarines, and by publicising instead the supposed faults, the government could clear the deck to allocate more funds to the project and invite assistance from the US.</blockquote>and ...<br><br><blockquote>The politicisation of the project was similarly evident in the continued criticism of the then Leader of the Opposition, Kim Beazley, Reith had earlier stated that, (most) Australians will remember he is the man who is responsible for the Collins class submarines and we are still trying to fix up the problems that he created at a very significant cost to the taxpayer.<br><br>Clearly, through further criticism of the Collins submarine project, the Coalition could target Beazley.  As Beazley had enjoyed popular support for much of the pre-election period up  until early September 2001 it was vital that he be neutralised electorally.As John Moore had so effectively publicised any fault in the submarines previously, Reith could reasonably expect that discrediting Beazley through this project would be successful.  Thus, both John Moore and Peter Reith in their public rhetoric to rectify the Â‘dud subsÂ’ had acted to allay the domestic threat and sustain the CoalitionÂ’s incumbency."</blockquote>Moore &amp; Reith are the Libs Coalition Defense Minister during the period.<br><br>The problems with the Collins class subs, while real, have been truly blown out of proportion and are largely due to:<br><br>i) Politicisation of the project due to change in ruling party with different foreign policies.<br>ii) Initial build problems with the 1st of class vessel constructed in Kockums shipyard.  These have largely been resolved.<br><br>For a read, sans politics, into the evolution of the Collins Class Sub from people in the industry, have a look at this thread ...<br><br><a href="http://defencetalk.com/forums/showthread.php?t=3875" rel="nofollow">RAN Collins class subs: verdict?</a></div>

We have them on our Subs.  He alluded to this on a seperate thread and it helps explains (if the tech is as good as he says it is) why our Challengers, despite being old hulls, are actually quite serious threats in the SEA arena.</div>
