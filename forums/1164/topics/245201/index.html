Sources said the submarine arm was operating at about 50 per cent of its authorised strength, with the strong West Australian economy enticing submariners into better-paid civilian jobs.<br><br>The manpower shortage has brought the number of sea days per operational submarine down from 113 in 2005 to an estimated 88 days this year.<br><br>Dr Nelson has also authorised the preparation of a new defence policy statement before the end of the year. The strategic update will be the Government's first major national security policy statement since 2005, with Dr Nelson ruling out a new defence white paper before the next election.<br><br>Dr Nelson this week received the draft report of an external review of the higher management of the Defence Department conducted by former senior public servant Elizabeth Proust. The report is expected to recommend an overhaul of Defence's information management and IT systems and streamlining of the department's committee system.<br></blockquote>I have to quote for i am afraid the article will be deleted.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Actually it's another case of lionnoisy making as much noise over any dirt he can dig up on the Aussies.<br><br>What the media says can be true, but it's rarely if ever, the full story.<br><br>What about the other side of the story, from the sailor's side of it?<br><br>In reality, despite all it's teething problems, the Collin's class sub is one of the deadliest SSKs in the world today. The fact that it often comes out ahead in exercises againsts the USN, and that the USN is studying it to learn how to improve it's abilities against SSK threats is telling on the actual potential of this system.<br><br>Here's a recent article that gives another picture on the Collins, by the Yanks no less:<br><br><blockquote><strong>Deadliest Diesel Boat in the World Goes to Sea</strong><br><br>April 5, 2007: Australia has completed the refurbishment and upgrades on the first of its six Collins class subs. The United States, in a rare move, gave Australia access to American sonar and underwater warfare systems technology for this. Australia is spending nearly a hundred million dollars each, to upgrade the sonar and fire control systems on its six Collins class subs, and this new deal with the <strong>U.S. means that those diesel electric subs will carry the most advanced electronics in the world. The Collins class boats, mainly because of the quality of their crews, have proved to be among the most capable diesel-electric subs in the world. <span style="color: red;">This is known because Collins class boats often train with U.S. Navy ships and aircraft, and usually come out ahead.</span></strong><br><br><strong>This has made the American admirals more concerned about the threat from diesel-electric subs. For the moment, however, none of America's potential naval foes have submarine crews as well trained as the Australians. <span style="color: red;">The new electronics will provide the Collins class boats with combat capabilities similar to the new U.S. Virginian class SSNs.</span></strong><br><br>The Collins class boats were built in Australia during the 1990s, and are based on a Swedish design (the Type 471.) At 3,000 tons displacement, the Collins are half the size of the American Los Angeles class nuclear attack subs. However, boats that size are nearly twice the size of subs Europeans are accustomed to designing and building for their own use. <strong>Australia needed larger boats because of the sheer size of the oceans that surround Australia. There were a lot of technical problems with the Collins class boats, which the media jumped all over. The design of these subs was novel and ambitious, using a lot of automation. This reduced the crew size to 45.</strong><br><br>Australia didn't formally "accept" all the Collins class boats until three years ago, when everyone agreed that all the major technical problems were fixed, or at least identified. The current problem is recruiting a sufficient number of qualified sailors to keep these subs at sea. <strong>Last year, because of personnel shortages, each available Collins class sub was only able to get to sea for 88 days. In 2005, each boat averaged 113 days.</strong> The Australian armed forces, in general, are having recruiting problems, and the government is providing more money (the traditional, and most effective, cure) to deal with the problem. </blockquote>So is it worth it for them to upgrade their subs for such a cost?<br><br>Unless you can find some other way to give any SSK in the world the abilities of Virginia class SSN, the amount they are spending is actually a very nice bargain.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>You shouldn't really be saying anything in the first place. The 88 days they are spending out at sea certainly isn't the disaster you are trying to make it out to be, and the cost they spent on upgrading their boats proved to be a very great deal, considering they are getting a package that puts their boats on par with the latest American SSNs.<br><br>It's apparent that the Aussies have a incredible open ocean sub on their hands and what unbalanced media reports you are tossing out isn't going to change the fact that the sailors see a totally different side of the story, know they have one of the deadilest SSKs in the world, have bested the USN in exercises, and also under study by the USN on how to better deal with SSK threats.<br><br>By all yardsticks they have a very good boat on their hands. The inability to field their boats as much as they would like is more reflective on them being unable to find people good enough to staff these boats (which is reflective on how advanced these SSKs actually are) then any reflection on the submarine themselves.<br><br><strong>So if you want to ask if they have a deadily and effective boat on their hands that is worth the cost price? Once you get over all the media jumping (of which you are prone to listening to), the answer is certainly a resounding yes.</strong><br><br>Here's a tip, this is a military forum so you jolly well post in here with the mindset of a grunt who does his homework and knows his stuff, not some person who blindly grabs articles off the web without knowing anything on the subject matter at all.<br><br>What can I say?<br><br>You got pwned!</div>
