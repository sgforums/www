The manchurian hoardes conquered and ruled China for 400 years, had they not been corrupted and allowed the 8 nations to occupy China, Sun Yet Sen would not have succeeded in his revolution to establish the Republic of China. Nobody ever occupy the vast land??? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_redface.gif" alt="Embarassed" title="Embarassed"><br>If the japanese did not attack Pearl Habour and pulled the yankees into the war, if they had not stretched themselves by attacking IndoChina, the Philippines and even Indonesia, was it not possible that they could have conquered China???  they had actually occupied more than half of China! <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br>China is big but history has shown that small tiny but strong foreign nations had tried to cut it up into pieces and shared in its resources. No?<br><br>The vast land stretching from China to central europe did not stop the mongol from occupying the land, the vast land in north american did not stopped the white men from occupying it and call it their own, the vast land stretching from England to Australia did not stop the British Empire from colonizing countries and make the people fly their flag and salute their queen. The difference is how powerful are the relative military powers. Sovereignty means nothing if the country has no credible defence forces to defend themselves. There is no difference today!<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by Fatum:</div><div class="quote_body">and some chaps are worried about a puny hundred million or so japanese ? ....  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_confused.gif" alt="Confused" title="Confused">  ... perhaps our national education classes are succeeding very well, but in the wrong way ... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"></div></blockquote> the hundred million or so japanese toke on Russia in the beginning of the century, destroyed the largest naval armada at that time; they successfully launched a surprised attack and destroyed a whole fleet of the american navy thousands of miles away from home; they invaded and occupied land hundred times their size, .... some chaps never studies history, or perhaps they studies but never learned. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by Fatum:</div><div class="quote_body">oh, btw ...

            <div class='col-md body'>so ... what's your point ? I don't see any that I haven't made, other than a demonstration of history as you perceive it.<br><br>yes, the mongol hoarde did occupy China, so did the Manchurians, but does occupation = defeat ? ... the physical and cultural vastness of China, with it multitudes, will swallow up any invaders, notice how the Qing dynasty got to be seen as an intrinsic part of China by history (and indeed, Qing maps are still used as the basis of defining her international boundaries today, no ? ), did you read what I've written at all ?  Yes, military power is a deterent, but you simplify the point, perhaps to paraphrase from Chiang Kai-Shek ... "The Japanese are a disease of the skin, the communists are a disease of the heart (of China) ... the man recognized that the japanese are a mere footnote in the history of China, in the greater scheme of things, which was why he was quite happy to conserve the majority of his forces for the coming fight with the communists, after the japanese are gone, no ? ... (a bad political mistake perhaps, but he was always more of a military man than a politician) but even so, speaking of the communists, look at China today, barely a century after Mao mounted the dragon throne ...<br><br>and of course, colonizing a few natives in loin cloths and spears is a very different proposition from trying to colonize a vast country with it's multitudes and an ancient civilization eh ? Even for India, indonesia, Malaysia, the phillipines, malaya, you realize that these modern countries were essentially post-colonial constructs cobbled together by western imperialists from small, easily subjugated princely states ? ... these countries never had a national consiousness, a national identity, until recently, quite quite unlike China.<br><br>I shall always remember a line from the movie "Empire of the Sun", by the "invited chink", Mr Chen to lockwood, "you've been in shanghai for a hundred years, not a bad inning, but only an incident, as for the japanese, four years ? .... we have 500 million fighting backup ... and we'll be here after this war an the next !" ...<br><br>I guess we must keep several things in perspective, yes, the lessons of history must never be forgotten, but then, history and time spans centuries, indeed, millenium to the chinese ... and we should all understand that history is a very powerful and convinent political tool ....<br><br>so, now that we're convinced that China cannot be "defeated", the question really is, what are her intentions, no ? ... who knows, perhaps in 50 years, if Singapore is still around, we'll be hosting Chinese aircraft carriers instead of American ones at Changi naval base, eh ? ... as for whether the rise of the dragon is a good thing for the rest of the world, especially in asia, we'll have to see how she welds her power ....<br><br>I'm crossing my fingers.<br><br>(you know, as much as I can see that our national education campaign is doing very well on providing some chaps with a certain view of history, I sometimes wonder how much of it is just skin deep and subconsious rejurgitation, judging by entries and comments to japanese chicks and pornstars threads over at Original Babe Forum, eh ? ... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"> )</div>

            </div>
            <div class='col-md body'>My point is, simply that a Japan with strong military is more a threat to the region than a strong China. History has shown that China can be defeated and conquered, it was conquered before and half of China was conquered by Japan in WW2. There may be different interpretations to historical facts, but Japan invaded and conquered most parts of Asia, and China was close to being defeated in WW2, are historical facts that cannot be changed. Facts do not change according to our perception.<br><br>Can China be defeated? Certainly yes, from a military point of view. If Japan alone could conquer half a China, there is no reason why Japan and America together cannot take on China as a nation, defeat its armed forces and  break it up into smaller nations. I will agree that Chinese, as a race, will not parish, due to its long history. For thousands of years, they shared the same history, the same language, the same culture, and the same identity.  Just like the Jews, Israel is in their heart. Of course, I will agree that the way China is growing, it would be damn difficult to conquer them.<br><br>The next question is, what would be the intention of a strong China? You said it correctly, they need no extra land, no need extra labour, but resources. If they don't want your land, don't want to control your people (surely they are not asking anybody to practice their communism, or democracy  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"> ), how can they be a threat to any nation? I can't see them using military power to force any country to supply oil, timber, do you? Of course, they will do all kind of arm twisting to get you to supply them, isn't that part of business? are the other bigger nations not doing the same thing already? So what's wrong with Chinese aircraft carriers if they pay for the berthing, and their sailors come R&amp;R visiting our IR? We should have places for both the US carriers and the Chinese carriers, may be even the Russian, the British and the French together.<br><br>Singapore education does not provide singaporean with any view on history, except the rise of PAP and Singapore. We need to read more to know exactly what happened in the past, and get a balance view on the perception on why things happened the way it did.<br></div>

There may be different interpretations to historical facts, but Japan invaded and conquered most parts of Asia, and China was close to being defeated in WW2, are historical facts that cannot be changed. Facts do not change according to our perception.<br><br>Can China be defeated? Certainly yes, from a military point of view. If Japan alone could conquer half a China, there is no reason why Japan and America together cannot take on China as a nation, defeat its armed forces and  break it up into smaller nations. I will agree that Chinese, as a race, will not parish, due to its long history. For thousands of years, they shared the same history, the same language, the same culture, and the same identity.  Just like the Jews, Israel is in their heart. Of course, I will agree that the way China is growing, it would be damn difficult to conquer them.<br><br>The next question is, what would be the intention of a strong China? You said it correctly, they need no extra land, no need extra labour, but resources. If they don't want your land, don't want to control your people (surely they are not asking anybody to practice their communism, or democracy  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"> ), how can they be a threat to any nation? I can't see them using military power to force any country to supply oil, timber, do you? Of course, they will do all kind of arm twisting to get you to supply them, isn't that part of business? are the other bigger nations not doing the same thing already? So what's wrong with Chinese aircraft carriers if they pay for the berthing, and their sailors come R&amp;R visiting our IR? We should have places for both the US carriers and the Chinese carriers, may be even the Russian, the British and the French together.<br><br>Singapore education does not provide singaporean with any view on history, except the rise of PAP and Singapore. We need to read more to know exactly what happened in the past, and get a balance view on the perception on why things happened the way it did.<br></div></blockquote>It's only prudent to be wary of all nations who are in the midst of expansion.<br><br>Our self-interest comes first, which means we are on the lookout for anyone who might hit the ocean too hard and catch us off-guard. Japan is an NATO ally. At least we know their behavior far more than the Chinese.<br><br>Do bear in mind that we are not aligned with the Chinese, nor the Japanese. We choose the degree of interaction, and I do not see Japanese official maps that label the entire South China Sea as her EEZ. Chinese officials may act and say one thing, but government policy is never as public or transparent as what we would like.<br><br>An expansionist PLA is not impossible, though signs are not showing that at the moment. Similarly, I believe that a confident Japan will manage herself much better than one who is repressed.</div>
