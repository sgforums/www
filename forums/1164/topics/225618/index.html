I seriously don't believe the Japs can take every nook and crany. If Japan tries to pull off any stunt again, can you imagine the partisan activity? That same conflict you mentioned, GW 2, also showed the US, being dragged into a insurgency with a low tech force. Even if the PLA is defeated, I don't see the Japanese effectively controlling the place.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>look gents, the issue here is not about whether the PLA's able to defend China, or whether the Japanese, or any other country on this earth, can defeat China .....<br><br>you can't, and don't "defeat" a billion people .... and you don't take over a country the size, today, or more than half a century ago ....<br><br>remember the yuan dynasty ? .... the ching dynasty ? .... be it mongol or manchu hoardes, sooner or later, the vastness of the country, and the sheer number of people would simply swallow any invaders up ! You see any manchuria today ? ... tibet ? ... where's inner mongolia ? ... if the japanese succeeded 60 years ago, today, there won't be any japanese left .... they'll all be chinese ! ... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"> ....<br><br>so the question is really, how China defines her boundaries, her ambitions, and how she welds her power, eh ? ... funny thing is how the Chinese claims to the "south sands" (spratleys), has it roots from qing goverment maps, a foreign dynasty, eh ? ... if you take a look at any official chinese maps, it shows basically the whole of the south china sea as chinese territorial waters ..... and some chaps are worried about a puny hundred million or so japanese ? ....  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_confused.gif" alt="Confused" title="Confused">  ... perhaps our national education classes are succeeding very well, but in the wrong way ... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br>oh, btw ... Iraq wasn't the first country to defy the UN .... China was ... and she took on the whole UN army in korea, if anyone forgot about it ... now this is not to rattle people off or finger the Chinese as potential imperialists, but to point out that, really, we have bigger things to worry about that to pander to to the 60 years old nightmare of invading japanese hoardes ....</div>

China doesn't give a flying fark about north korea, it's an embaressment to them, but if south korea is aligned with China instead of the states, then china can safely let north korean collaspe, and let the south shoulder the burden, neh ? ...<br><br>when China finally rears her head for real ... we'll all know she's already won .....<br><br>so .... is your "pu tong hua" good ? ...<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"></div>
