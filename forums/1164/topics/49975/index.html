I'm part of those involved and if everything pans out, I think it'll be very nice. Will post links when that comes up.

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote>We have done it. On Saturday 26th July we flew our first flight from Archerfield Airport to our new home at Sunshine Coast airport. A 30 minute flight with a take-off roll of 1500ft and departure to the east over water included low and high speed flight and some aerobatics. The aircraft performed like a dream and all systems worked perfectly. It was a beautiful clear day and we could see the whole of the east coast from up to 20,000ft. It was worth every minute and after a successful landing at Sunshine Coast we were all smiles.<br><br>This has been a long and sometimes frustrating project and was only completed by the efforts of a dedicated and hard working team of engineers. To them go our heartfelt thanks for allowing this fantastic aircraft to once again enjoy its normal environment. We will take a short break now and then proceed with the remainder of the flight testing and my endorsement.<br><br>Sometime next year if all goes to plan, we will be doing limited flights with fare paying passengers. When I can realise some spare time we will post some photos. Unfortunately we have nothing of the aircraft in the air but will work at it.<br><br>What a wonderful feeling to have realised this long cherished dream and once again our thanks to all that were involved in this project.</blockquote><img src="http://www.hunterflight.com/images/Maroochy.jpg"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>AUG 27, 2003<br>Pilot breathes new life into ex-RSAF warbird<br><br>The 33-year-old Hawker Hunter, restored by a team led by SIA pilot as a labour of love, will now take tourists in Australia up for fun flights<br><br>By David Boey<br><br>ONE of Singapore's first jet fighters, a two-seater Hawker Hunter, has found a new lease of life after undergoing extensive restoration in Australia.<br><br>Captain David Currie, 59, an Australian who is a Singapore Airlines pilot, spearheaded the eight-year restoration project, together with seven aeronautical engineers and three former Hunter pilots - all of whom offered their services for free.<br><br>With their efforts, the Hunter, tail number 528, took off from Archerfield Airport in Brisbane, Australia on July 26 this year for a short flight to its new home on the Gold Coast.<br><br>The 'new' plane will now be used to give tourists some thrills, at the rate of A$4,500 (S$5,136) for a 30-minute flight.<br><br>Recalling how Hunter 528 took to the skies, Capt Currie said yesterday: 'It was the most exhilarating day of my life. The whole thing has been a fantastic dream.<br><br>'There were stages when we thought we'd never finish, but the takeoff was just wonderful.'<br><br>The warplane took off in front of thousands of spectators who crammed the airport's fence-line to watch it make its first flight after more than 10 years.<br><br>The event attracted a lot of media attention, and was even broadcast on radio in Brisbane.<br><br>For his day job, Capt Currie flies Boeing 747-400 Megatops. But the former fighter pilot, who has clocked more than 24,000 hours in 43 years of flying, wanted an aircraft with more panache.<br><br>He has flown two kinds of British-made fighters - Hunters and Vampires - as well as Boeing 707 and 747 airliners.<br><br>He found exactly what he was looking for when the Republic of Singapore Air Force (RSAF) sold its 21 surviving Hunters in 1995.<br><br>The warplanes were delivered in 1970, and were decommissioned by the RSAF in 1992 - making them the force's longest-serving fighters.<br><br>Capt Currie paid US$30,000 for his Hunter and another US$10,000 to have it shipped to Australia.<br><br>'I don't have any children, so this is a substitute,' he said.<br><br>Only three former RSAF Hunters have been restored to flying condition. Although all of the RSAF's 21 Hunter jets were sold, the rest are either in museums or are looking for new owners.<br><br>The pilot's experience flying Hunters on ground attack missions for the Royal Rhodesian Air Force helped him immensely when Hunter 528 was stripped apart and rebuilt.<br><br>His restoration team is made up of former pilots and engineers who fought in the former Rhodesia, now Zimbabwe.<br><br>The team estimates that Hunter 528 can fly for another 20 years if it goes on short, 30-minute flights regularly.<br><br>Capt Currie's next challenge is to get his wife to join him in his new toy.<br><br>'She has yet to agree, but I'm working on it,' he said.<br><br><a href="http://straitstimes.asia1.com.sg/storyprintfriendly/0,1887,206768,00.html?" rel="nofollow">http://straitstimes.asia1.com.sg/storyprintfriendly/0,1887,206768,00.html?</a></div>
