                  <p> When someone relies only on Janes Defence and disregards the testimony of thousands of grunts who actually use the weapon day in day out and are contradicting what Janes says... I think the arrogrant one is quite clear.</p>
                  <p>Has this gun expert being with the SAR-21 in actual field conditions and seen how it actually works in the field before writing his article?</p>
                  <p>No.</p>
                  <p>Also what do you think this gun expert would say when he gets to compare other systems like the G36C, the Tavor, the FN2000 and what have you not against the SAR-21?</p>
                  <p>Going by your logic, we ought to trust the computer engineers at Microsoft when they say that Microsoft Windows is a good and stable OS because they know more about computers then us, regardless of the experience and problems we actually have with Windows and the existence of better systems out there.</p>
                  <p>Also recently, the military experts behind future weapons duffed up on describing our MATADOR as capable of firing smart munitions that can tell between soft and hard targets when the actual smartness of the weapon is the grunt using it and manually selecting the warhead mode, are you going to argue on the basics of this article? </p>
                  <p>Basically you are relying on an article that is written who no particular point of reference, not to mention you are trying to claim bizzare likely advantages that it has over other firearms, most amusingly being you trying to support lionnoisy's handbag carry stance as an advantage, the superiority of the 1.5x over advanced modular sighting systems like reflex and ACOG systems, and right not the false claim that factory zero offers it an advantage over comparable firearms when a simple check reveals just the SAR-21 main competitors in the market already come with such a feature.</p>
                  <p>Basically your approach is lionnoisy, selectively pick an article and harp on it repeatedly using the "qualifications" of the writers as a subsitite for logic, which is not surprising given in the Tavor thread your main push for the merit of your arguments was not in it's logic, but that you were some kind of an "officer" who spent far more time on the range then the normal "specs" and "grunts" and hence had the right to overwrite their concern.</p>
                  <p>I remember most amusingly, you argued that since it was possible for you to engage targets with the 1.5x scope, anybody else calling for a better system was "weak" and not a "true soldier", brushing aside the obvious and great advantage that such systems offered to the soldier in combat. </p>
                  <p>A true nut case would be the one that chooses to hide behind a single article and is unable to argue his case convincingly with people who actually had real experience with the weapon who contradict him. In fact it seems his own resource is to pretty much say "my teacher said so" even when faced with overwhelming evidence or come up with "new materials and technology" that only exist in his own head.</p>
                  <p>So who is the false soldier here? The one who only knows how to quote media articles or the one who draws from his actual experience with the equipment in the field?</p>

Please farking open ur eyes big big on the thread title and it say SAR21. So naturally i compare it by using SAR21,if it was on M16,i will gladly compare it with M16. and please farking open ur eyes big big, my nick is gaoxingdcf07, not gaosingdcf07. my nick can't be too difficult to write,u farking blur cock.. U just only know how to quote from Jane's  articles and when people rufuted ur claims and u start to quote again... Typical of a empty vessel making noise</p>

              <p>That's a nice try to put a number on things. Why insist on 6 and not 600?</p>
              <p>The only way to make a fair judgement is to compare the SAR versus other rifles at that time which came out with an INTERGAL optical sighting system at that time, one also needs to take note that iron sights are still popular in rifle designs at that time as well as the option of going P-rail modular, which eventually became more popular then the intergal system. The only way to make a fair and rational judgement is when you compare the SAR-21 in the "raygun bullpups with intergal optical sights" class.</p>
              <p>Hence if you are talking about intergal optical sights when it comes to such rifles, the SAR-21 basic has prehaps the most unimpressive sights in the class.</p>
              <p>Tavor, G36, Vector CR-21,  and even the crappy SA80 (which was introduced much eariler then the SAR-21) have far better bare-bones sighting systems then the primitive SAR-21 1.5X scope.</p>
              <p>In fact, note that the later versions of the SAR-21 that ST generated like MMS or lightweight carbine did away with the crappy scope entirely and tried something else.</p>
              <p>What else can I say except that you are in denial?</p>

              <p>LOL, you are now officially beyond hope.</p>
              <p>So the fact that many people are still smoking and alive means
              that it's good for their health lah?</p>

              </div>
              <p>That's a nice try to put a number on things. Why insist on 6 and
              not 600?</p>
              <p>The only way to make a fair judgement is to compare the SAR
              versus other rifles at that time which came out with an INTERGAL
              optical sighting system at that time, one also needs to take note
              that iron sights are still popular in rifle designs at that time as
              well as the option of going P-rail modular, which eventually became
              more popular then the intergal system. The only way to make a fair
              and rational judgement is when you compare the SAR-21 in the
              "raygun bullpups with intergal optical sights" class.</p>
              <p>Hence if you are talking about intergal optical sights when it
              comes to such rifles, the SAR-21 basic has prehaps the most
              unimpressive sights in the class.</p>
              <p>Tavor, G36, Vector CR-21,  and even the crappy
              SA80 (which was introduced much eariler then the
              SAR-21) have far better bare-bones sighting systems then the
              primitive SAR-21 1.5X scope.</p>
              <p>In fact, note that the later versions of the SAR-21 that ST
              generated like MMS or lightweight carbine did away with the
              crappy scope entirely and tried something else.</p>
              <p>What else can I say except that you are in denial?</p>

              <p><br>The G36 sight is extremely innovative. It comes with a 3x sight for long range engagement as well as a 1x red dot sight for fast short range engagement above the 3x sight. Unfortunately this innovation is not a feature in the export version which has only the 1.5x scope as u had mentioned.</p>

              <p>The basic G36 sights that the Germans use are far more advanced then SAR-21, as foxtrout8 has mentioned it. Notice the irony here? The Germans export stepped-down models for customers while retaining the best for their own troops while our own ST seems to ship the best stuff for overseas customers while retaining the bare-bones models for our own troops.</p>
              <p>Note the G36 sights are a true example of battlefield innovation and not some "let's slap on a basic 1.5x and tell the grunts to rely on our innovative, world's first intergal LAD to do the job for night fighting".</p>
              <p>The Vector 1X reflex sight offers significant advantages over the SAR-21 sight, most important being in it's ability to be used in low light without resorting to the LAD. In a low light engagement users of the SAR-21 basic are at a significant disadvantage versus users of a reflex system.</p>
              <p>In fact you will notice that advanced versions of the SAR like MMS do away entirely with the 1.5x and go back to 1x but using a reflex system instead or mounting more advanced systems when magnification is needed.  </p>
              <p>I am struggling?  I am giving you a chance by trying to answer your question as fairly as possible. If you really insist on me giving 6 rifles at the time you are really digging your own grave.</p>
              <p>First an foremost I focused on answering the question fairly, given at the time the SAR-21 was released arms manufacturers were deciding between going P-rail or intergal optical systems. Ultimately flexibility ruled in favour of the P-rail modular systems which in their basic configuration will be mounting a scope that is far superior to that of the SAR-21.</p>
              <p>So how are you going to judge a weapons like that which have no "basic" version to speak of?</p>
              <p>A good example would be the FN2000, which has no "basic" version but is instead designed to accept just about anything you can slap on it from reflex sights to a computerized laser guided grenade launching system.</p>
              <p>Another issue is also how the weapon is actually implemented and used. We can try to argue that the SAR-21 has better sights then a bare-bones M-16 but as it turns out now the American grunts are using M-16s running on P-rail systems that are equipped with far better sights then our SAR-21 basic, allowing them to outshoot us anyday. Hence our argument becomes useless and just talk that has little bearing in reality. Basically this is just a fight for bragging rights ignoring what is really happening.</p>
              <p>This is where your agument is flawed, one cannot just look at the basic model of the weapon and compare them basic to basic but instead look at how the entire weapon is designed to be used in the end. Going by your argument, the SAR-21 has more "advanced" sights then rifles like the SCAR which come with iron sights but were designed from the outset to be modular weapons to accept modular sights, but are perfectly happy to go on their iron sights.</p>
              <p>Flexibility is the key here, so how you want to compare? By trying to restrict the case to something that is not reflective of what is really happening in the real world or by making your arguments and points based on things which will have basis in reality?</p>
              <p>The fact is quite basic- we claim to be one of the most advanced militaries in the region, or even the world with out weapons R&amp;D technology but can't even equip our own troops with a proper sighting system that is well thought out and designed that offers the soldiers options and not gimmicks like intergal LAD and factory zero which are more or less one-trick ponies.</p>
              <p>What we need are sights that are flexible (ie. modular) as well as offering us options (not having to rely soley on LAD for night fighting with the main scope becoming mostly useless). In this respect the SAR-21 basic cannot be considered to be that good a rifle when we can do much better, unless you want to say "ooh, our SAR has more advanced sights then the Khaybar KH2002 assault rifle"... which unfortunately, isn't really an achivement at all.</p>
              <p>Ultimately it's easy to construct any argument to your favour by asking for restrictive conditions to sastify them, but it does not follow that the argument you construct from these conditions to "trap" your opponents will actually lend any merit to your case at all.</p>
              <p>The crux of the issue still remains, the ST  promised to equip our troops with the best that they could with their resources and technology in the SAR-21 series, but the way things really go seems to indicate that some corners are being cut here and there. Arguing till the sun goes down on the merits of the SAR-21 basic will not retify the situtation that we can put better weapons into the hands of our troops and are not doing it for some reason.</p>
              <p>And you know what is the greater irony? They are touting new systems like SSW when we can't even bring our troops up to date with a modernized version of the SAR-21, giving them a model that is running on 1990s weapons design thinking when the rest of the world has moved on quite a bit.</p>
              <p>The point remains, the SAR-21 basic needs to be changed or swapped out for some other variant if we want to at least claim that our troops have the best weapon they can get from ST. The irony I feel is some of our grunts train with a thai trooper, and see him carrying a more advanced version of the SAR-21.</p>
