              <p>Due to out small island and lack of depth in our defense - if there is a war - we be hit - just how badly ... ? I kind of wonder what make you so sure where your SAR-21 is kept will never be hit ?</p>
              </blockquote>
              <p> What makes you think that if your SAR-21 is hit that getting a new weapon is the least of your problems?</p>
              <p>Truth is if an enemy is attacking singapore and actually has the time and effort to go after small-arms assets it means that they more or less have total domination of our country and that the SAF has been caught with their pants down.</p>
              <p>Given this level of surprise, it is doubtful the mysterious weapon crates of yours will be untouched... in fact any smart enemy would probably go after things like Mandai UAF first before going down the list to hitting your personal weapon.</p>
              <p>Once again you put the cart before the horse.</p>
              <blockquote>
              <p>If we have to fight a war we are screwed !!! If you can get a hand on a brand new SAR-21 in the middle of the chao - god is kind to you !!!</p>
              </blockquote>
              <p> Hey, why not get a brand SheVa antilander tank that shoots nuclear rounds to go with it? You are talking in fantasy I am talking in hard fact. You go on and on about things like factory-zero while I point out that in practice this thing is hardly important in most situations and that the more basic things like inability to fight at night and a lously default scope are more pressing issues.</p>
              <p>Your powers of logic it seems, is not kind to you.</p>
              <blockquote>
              <p>I didn't say that sar-21 features don't work once it gets even slightly used. You are the one that twisting words again to say that.</p>
              </blockquote>
              <p>Wrong, what I am saying is that there is <span style="text-decoration: underline;">nothing special</span> about the SAR-21 factory zero, given it is common practice in the modern AR industry to factory zero their weapons in the first place (hence it's not even an advantage to begin with), as well as the fact that arms manufacturers do not give their weapons factory zero in case the soldier does not have time to zero his weapon, that's pretty rubbish. </p>
              <p>Not to mention pointing out the unreality of you trying to construct your point for factory zero based on the event that you have to go to war without being issued a personal weapon video game style because your weapon was magically bombed.</p>
              <p>Basically you are trying to argue for putting a rollcage and five-point harness on a tricycle because one day the tricycle might go over a cliff.</p>
              <p>LOL.</p>
              <p>You're messing yourself up, you betrayed yourself when</p>
              <blockquote>
              <p><br>Are you sure your SAR-21 is just slightly used. LOL i doubt so !!!<br><br>Is it fair to compare a scope on SAr-21 to m16 iron sight - why don't you compare Sar-21 to M16 with scope ! We have M16 that been mounted scope - we should have issue you that - think you will not scream on SAR-21 any more .</p>
              </blockquote>
              <p>First and foremost the SAR-21 I was using was one of the later production versions that was improved after the terrible QC compliants that ST got from the units they first introduced the SAR.</p>
              <p>Secondly, when I was in NS, the SAR was not even in service for 5 years, in addition to the recent make of the weapon, as well as the requirement to pass FFF, means that the weapons themselves are new and certainly less then 5 years old. Contrast this to the M-16s that we also used beside them that were much older.</p>
              <p>Thirdly being a frontline unit in 3rd Guards, there must be a redcon status to be achieved as opposed to training schools which can afford to use beat up weapons. This means that the weapons we used were supposed to be the cream of the crop, with only the warstock reserve being newer then that. I hardly think achieving retcon can be done by using training hand-me-down stock.</p>
              <p>Even more so those guys in 6th SIR doing actual POI ops, are those people using beat-up-hand-me-downs?</p>
              <p>So beat-up-hand-me-downs? Prehaps an "officer" in SIW might see more of them LOL.</p>
              <p>And what has this to do with scopes and iron sights? You are talking about "factory zero" no?</p>
              <blockquote>
              <p>So you telling me your handme down SAR-21 features don't work once it gets even slightly used. - good think we now know the problem is you !</p>
              </blockquote>
              <p>As I said, I am not sure what you are talking about except you are desperately trying to imagine that the fact that factory zeroing is actually not an advantage by fantasizing that all people who have a beef with the SAR are using beat-up-hand-me-downs.</p>
              <p>Is there any other person the wolf can fault for being unable to escape the hunter except that the fact that his own stories are just not making sense?</p>

              <p>Avoding the question again eh?</p>
              <p>Hmm, the point is simple and you are trying your best not to answer it because it's obvious that you are running up a dead end by trying to bring "factory zero" to it's extreme.</p>
              <p>The point is, despite your "rah rah" about factory zero in reality this thing is not only not unique (the Tavor, G36C, as well as virtually any self-respecting small arms manufacturer have this feature as well), it actually has very little utility in modern war.</p>
              <p>What you have tried to do is to construct a bizzare an unlikely case for factory zero using vauge and ambigious examples and then present them as the reality of things. The truth is even if our warstock was bombed and we had to get fresh weapons, time would be spent doing field zeroing before we actually go into ops with them (number one rule of ops is to prepare as much as possible). The only way your (non-unique) factory zeroing factor becomes an advantage is when you have to just grab a weapon enemy-at-the-gates style and chiong at the enemy.</p>
              <p>Of which I would say, this situtation is so unlikely not to mention bizzare that if you should ever find yourself in it, it's probably better that you shoot a certain NSman officer Storywolf and join the enemy instead of going on such a plan.</p>
              <p>In fact the idea of factory zero is to cut down on in-the-box range time spent on zeroing and to this it works pretty well. But to bring it that far and say that the SAR-21 does not need to be zeroed is rubbish, and additionally trying to say that the feature is good by inventing amazing senarios is futher rubbish. And it's even more rubbish to say that the factory-zero offers the SAR-21 over other modern infantry firearms because virtually all firearms in the generation of the SAR-21 are manfactured with factory zero, it's such a common practice that it's somewhat amazing that STK would want to advertise it as a feature at all, and more amazing that storywolf would actually believe it.</p>
              <p>But then again it's not too surprising coming from him...</p>

              <p>Please refer to gun expert - David Crane - from defense review magazine. ST have been on road shows in US - they do not do zeroing there, people just shoot and shoot and are able to hit target - please explain that ! How they do it ? Also David himself visited the factory - just pick up one of the new random rifle and head to range - without zeroing he is able to hit his targets !!! As a gun expert - he is happy with it. That where the beauty of the special sight. Are you more qualified then him a professional gun expert ? </p>

              <p>You're making a circular argument, instead of considering and addressing the points of your opponent's argument you are trying to divert it by creating a false assumption to divert the merit of your opponent's testimony... this is a very basic and serious flaw of logic.</p>
              <p>Ie. your argument is similar to something like this:</p>
              <p>A: "The SAR-21 is good, only stupid people claim the SAR-21 is lously"</p>
              <p>B: "Why are these people stupid?"</p>
              <p>A: "Well, they claim the SAR-21 is lously"</p>
              <p>In this case, note that A is trying to disprove the less-then-favourable testimony of people on the SAR-21 by claiming that their testimony is unreliable because they are stupid.</p>
              <p>However when asked about why they are like that, A would claim that unreliability comes from the fact that they give unfavourable testimonies on the SAR-21, which of course does nothing to prove his first statement in the first place!</p>
              <p>This is circular reasoning, a basic fallacy that I am afraid that in your haste to prove something ambigious like weapon quality, you have commited Storywolf.</p>
              <p>In any case, are you saying 3rd Guards and 6th SIR, units that need to be on high redcon at all times are using worn out weapons or that they are not "cream of the crop?"</p>

              <p>Bingo! At least in winter conditions the SAR21 proved to be rubbish. The Norwegian army tested it for a couple of weeks before it was thrown out along with the AUG.

Strange - you seem to have slam that very ideal in the discussion on 40mm grenade rounds, when someone told you that singapore is the world lead in 40mm grenade ... !!!</p>

              <p>Popular Mechanics have a section that specially cover weapons ! Please check that out.<br><br>Janes Defense also cover SAR-21 on their article . They are are defense magazine. - Whether how reputable they are - I believe you all quote a lot of information from them. So you only select to believe their article when it is to your advantage and when people use article of them against you - you write them of crap ?<br> </p>

How do one be aggressor - of course they are at your door step already threatening you, if that is not forward stragtegy - you mean you see aggressor that use backward stragtegy - Moving their troops away ?</p>

For the night shoot, the LAD is tweaked (using SAR21 C-tool) to make sure that the LAD red dot is at the centre of the scope.

              <p>Lol, storywolf must have really lost it to accuse Sepecat of being a clone of me.</p>
              <p>What's funnier is that he can't even get the difference between tactical gloves and winter gloves correct, and when proven wrong he went on to suggest that gloves designed to be used in -20 degree weather can somehow come in tactical gloved thickness... apparently the next thing he's going to suggest is that Level IV body armour comes in Level 2A weights.</p>
              <p>LOL.</p>
              <p>Also, according to him, the opinions of grunts who have used to weapon day in and day out under field conditions ought to be disregarded over the opinion of media articles written by organizations who have only had the bare minimum of time with the weapon under best conditions.</p>
              <p>So apparently in his world, you ought to trust the opinion of a person who has only seen the trailer instead of a person who has seen the whole movie in deciding if the movie is good or bad.</p>
              <p>Seriously, none of his points will ever fly in the court of law, let alone in debate.</p>
              <p>So apparently for him, the SAF's duty in times of crisis is to sit around and do nothing and let our warstock get bombed so that we can find some excuse to mess ourselves over just so we can use some feature called factory zero that is found in virtually all modern firearms in the first place.</p>
              <p>Wow, this guy is just amazing...</p>
              <p>Apparently in his world, common sense is a superpower:</p>

            <div class='col-md body'><p>i think the term "factory zero" is actually neutralizing the sight to the standard alignment in quality control terms. Once an individual person uses the rifle the alignment might not suit him ie: the distance from the eye to scope etc. Anyway SAR21 at 100m doesnt really requires zeroing but after that definitely had to zero. Anyway i prefer M16 than SAR cos i dont like the feel of SAR21's trigger pull and the Scope tends to fog. Wont get those problems in M16.</p></div>
