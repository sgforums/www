              <p>Heh , SAR 21  is not just a little heavier than M16, it is a lot heavier.</p>
              <p>Rifle can be light &amp; be also accurate.  Felt recoil can be mitigated not by weight only.</p>
              <p>You are absolutely right - it is pure theory that SAR 21 sight is factory zeroed &amp; by implication needs not be re zeroed. In reality , all sights , even the ACOGs will need re zeroing eventually.    </p>

              <p>Actually I am becoming a bit suspicious of storywolf... he claimed to be an officer with tons of range time and hence must have been extremely experienced with the SAR-21...</p>
              <p>I find it very, very odd that he would mention that the factory zero keeps, considering my own experience with the SAR-21 in different units, as well as the grunts I've talked to say otherwise.</p>
              <p>But hmm, maybe he only shot the new weapons, but I know this for sure, that the whole factory-zeroed thing is more of an advertising feature then reality... not unless you want to shoot your SAR at anything effectively beyond 100 meters.</p>

              <p>While I agree that the TAR21 is much lighter, the Isrealis does much of the world's media,  magnified the superiority of this weapon.</p>
              <p>To start with .. Videos from the range and strip down. The Tar21 does look filmsy internally during the strip down, and the range shooting is horrible, every semi-auto single shot requires the shooter to re-acquire the target, due to the upward recoil. While it does hit the target 300m out with it's factory fit reflex-sight. The weapons don't seem to balance well and is butt heavy, requiring the shooter to lay it inplace to their shoulder for accurate shot. The TAR21 is still very infant in the field, to know how durable it is.. and I don't think it's that durable.. reliablity is part of this equation.</p>

              <p>Depends on who you want to believe. And the possibility remains that the shooter could simply be a bad shooter, lol. In any case I have been at SAR-21 shoots where the users are unable to hit anything at 200 meters, apparently because the factory zero is not working.</p>
              <p>But personally I do not think the Isrealis make unreliable weapons given they have far more experience in making weapons then us, as well as use weapons in some of the most unforgiving environments like the desert. And the TAR was designed first and foremost for their own needs, if the TAR could not work in the sandbox, then I hardly think the IDF would go ahead with it.</p>
              <p>AFAIK, the TAR was designed to be CG rear, to put the CG of the rifle closer to the user's body during use as well as to minimize recoil, so it's a deliberate design move. Smart? I don't know I haven't shot the Tavor before.</p>
              <p>Also in terms of deployment, the TAR-21 has found far more users then the SAR-21 and no real compliants from their users so far. In terms of use and deployment, the Tavor is quite far ahead of the SAR-21, of which our troops are still using the basic model.</p>

              <p><br>While the Shooter is a factor.. In fact, he did hit the target 300m out with the first shot. But had to re-acquire the target again. He seemed to be a competent shooter.</p>
              <p>But, I'm talking about recoil here. It seemed that the TAR21 have a strong recoil for a bullpub, if not similar to the M-16. In fact, worst, since it went all over the place after every shot, especially upwards. The short barrel could be a factor. But this does not explain the recoil as a whole. The awkward handling also gets a minus from me.</p>
              <p>As to the users, The IDF themselves are largely sticking to their M-4s, the TAR21 is getting a every slow deployment. You could hardly see one during the Lebanon incursion two years ago, and even today. How many are exported anyway, token numbers - India, Some latin countries ?</p>
              <p>As someone has said, Branding has indeed have something to do with this. In fact, there are hardly any detailed reviews from the fields. Maybe it's too new.. but the strip down shows internal white plastic parts.. I think one was the coil spring retainer or end.</p>
              <p>If it's up to me, put a P-rail onto a SAR-21 with a Reflex sight, heavier or not. it's golden.  It's low on recoil, short, accurate and reliablity is there (minus the Scope). I like the balances to. But Bullpubs does have it's (Some say) Flaws.</p>

              <p>Its taking US Army and Russians an eternity because there is simply nothing out there which has significant advantage over the M16 s and AKs resp.</p>
              <p>Despite the  complaints about low lethality , low reliability etc of M4s, US is buying yet more of these weapons to replace M16s in the field.  More importantly is that they are investing a lot into optics used together with the M4s. Hitting a target in the first place is still a lot more  important than anything else.</p>

              <p>But, I'm talking about recoil here. It seemed that the TAR21 have a strong recoil for a bullpub, if not similar to the M-16. In fact, worst, since it went all over the place after every shot, especially upwards</p>
              </blockquote>
              <p>What are you talking about? The M-16 has one of the best recoil characteristics of any 5.56mm rifle due to its direct impingement gas system.</p>
              <blockquote>
              <p>It's low on recoil, short, accurate and reliablity is there (minus the Scope). I like the balances to. But Bullpubs does have it's (Some say) Flaws.</p>
              </blockquote>
              <p>In fact the M-16 should have better recoil handling then the SAR-21, which uses a long stroke piston system for that matter. And having shot both rifles I can concur.  But the recoil on the SAR-21 is not so much that it is any issue for me.</p>
              <blockquote>
              <p>As to the users, The IDF themselves are largely sticking to their M-4s, the TAR21 is getting a every slow deployment. You could hardly see one during the Lebanon incursion two years ago, and even today. How many are exported anyway, token numbers - India, Some latin countries ?</p>
              </blockquote>
              <p>Wrong, the TAR-21 is replacing the M-16 and M-4 in significant numbers, and the intention is to completely replace them in their warstock eventually in fact they have already seen combat deployment in the hands of their users:</p>

              <p>For a relatively new assault rifle in an oversaturated small arms market this is extremely remarkable.</p>
              <p>If you are talking about token numbers then it would be our SAR-21. Note that the SAF only uses the SAR-basic so far and all of the other variants were pimped for the export market, but as of yet we've found far less customers.</p>

              <p>Ultimately most AR making-companies advertise their products as "low-recoil", even the SAR-21 was touted as "low-recoil" when it's long stroke gas piston design actually means more moving parts and weights then the previous system in the M-16 it replaces.</p>
              <p>But I believe it is a moot point.</p>
              <p>But the point is if you are talking about 5.56mm ARs, they all practically have low recoil to begin with compared to the other infantry weapon format, the 7.62mm.</p>

              <p>Additionally, the whole idea of "factory zero" was not so grunts could take weapons from the box and shoot with them, but to cut down on the zeroing time spent in the range.</p>
              <p>This is what the literature says:</p>
              <blockquote>
              <p>The scope is factory-zeroed, and requires minimal further zeroing to suit different users. This minimizes non-training range time to zero the weapons and maximises live-firing training hours</p>
              </blockquote>
              <p>As for combat advantage there is practically none at all... in fact you'll be probably worse of because the "standard" zero of the sights will not suit you as perfectly as a weapon that you bothered to zero on the range to your needs.</p>
              <p>And of course the zero of all weapons, especially new ones which have not been broken in will slip because the shooting characteristics of the weapon will change over time as it is used.</p>
              <p>So what advantage does the factory zero give in practice? Unless the SAF is in the practice of issuing non-personal weapons to their troops straight from the box and sending them into battle without time to prepare and personalize the sights to the users...</p>
              <p>It provides none at all.</p>
              <p>It's about the same as the lionnoisy claimed advantage of being able to carry the SAR-21 like a handbag and "run for your life"</p>

              <p>Yawn, this is a true blue lionnoisy "what if tomorrow anytime, anyday go to war" kind of argument. The same kind of logical fallacy that allows "you to run for yr life" carrying the SAR-21 in one hand.</p>
              <p>You are coming up with an arbitary, and random "worse scenerio" without accounting for the likelyhood of such an event and the percieved advantages of having something to prepare for it.</p>
              <p>Basically if I want to imagine the worst case scenerio, it would be something more severe then lacking a personal weapon and having to find a new one. Zeroing a weapon is hardly a difficult task even in field conditions. If I have to go to ops with a fresh weapon that magically appears from nowhere and everything in chaos chances are we are pretty screwed to begin with.</p>
              <p>What is difficult and something harder to deal with is how to fight at night when you can't use anything but a non-tactical LAD.</p>
              <p>So let me point out.</p>
              <p>Likelyhood of losing your personal weapon in war (meaning sneak attack by enemy on local camp with also means Singapore is pretty screwed): not very high.</p>
              <p>Likelyhood of finding the SAR-21 poor night fighting abilities a problem in combat: very high.</p>
              <p>So after advertising so much about "factory zero" which one is the bigger and more likely issue?</p>
              <p>The whole issue on factory zero is to cut down on range time zeroing, but as I would point out ST hardly makes it with the intention of going to war with factory zero, nor is it even a unique feature- practically all modern firearms come out of the factory with a default factory zero.</p>
              <p>So what advantage does it give again? Nothing.</p>
              <p>Do you walk around with a lighting rod on your head all time time?</p>
