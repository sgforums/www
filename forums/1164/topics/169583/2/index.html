Maybe giving them the option of either having kids or serving NS would scare more into having babies lol<br></div>

This is a natural biological fact.<br>However, not all countries practice conscription or NS, which is a socio-political policy.<br>So women should not use the natural ability to give birth as a form of excuse to replace national duty, when not all men around the world serve in conscription. Its like comparing apples with oranges.<br>The effects of NS in Singapore is obvious - male and female attitudes are indeed different.</div>
