The proposal is to use either the Bionix or (UVLP) Primus chassis... I feel that the Bionix is too lightly built to handle the stress of prolonged firing of a 120mm main gun. The Primus chassis, while providing room for more ammunition and sensors, has only light armour and is comparatively large for a light tank, comprising mobility. This is crucial since tank units complement the mechanised infantry, unlike artillery which operates further from the enemy lines. The selection of this chassis may impede progress through denser vegetation. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_exclaim.gif" alt="Exclamation" title="Exclamation"><br><br>Comments anyone?</div>

Gary is saying having a chasis to sustain "firing a 120mm gun", not having a chasis capable of "intercepting" a hit from a 120mm round... Please...  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>Do let us know if you know of any tank that is designed to withstand a hit from a 120mm APFSDS round...  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"></div>
