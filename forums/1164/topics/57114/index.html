Well.... actually it is.<br><br>Please explain me how a communist nation will surpass a capitalist nation within 20 years?<br>Are you saying the US GDP won't grow for the coming 20 years or so?, you have a better chance that the EU will surpass the US than China. China won't have a shot at the world leading economic superpower for another 100 years.<br>China's defence budget is 65 billion that of the USA is 390 and in four years will be well over 500 billion, if you have checked the links I provided, how do you suspect china to close that gap? it is insane the USA has like now 6 times more and increases it with 15% a year or so to 500 billion, China can't possibly ever match that, you have seen it for yourself. China is a paper tiger. The gap keeps increasing. I provided enough sources for that, now it is time that you provide some sources instead of baseless speculation, fueled by national pride.<br><br>I never implied that, I just said that China is far weaker than the USA</blockquote>tis post is frm another forum..<br><a href="http://www.blizzforums.com/showthread.php?t=27324&amp;page=1&amp;pp=15" rel="nofollow">http://www.blizzforums.com/showthread.php?t=27324&amp;page=1&amp;pp=15</a><br><br>any comment?</div>

By 2025, its population will be 1.5 billion, its GDP in the $6 trillion-$7 trillion range (comparable to that of the US or the EU in the mid-1990s), and it will be able to avail itself of the most advanced technologies.<br><br>And the following scenario for future Taiwan crises is seen as possible, even likely: China decides to try to force Taiwan to accept reunification on Beijing's terms. Its first military step is a naval blockade of Taiwan. The United States sends ships to challenge the blockade. In response, the Chinese threaten missile attacks or hit American vessels, persuading Washington that it has to choose between going to war and pulling back. Hesitation in Washington or a decision to retreat prompts the collapse of the Taiwanese stock market, currency and economy. The Taiwanese establishment quickly accepts whatever deal Beijing is offering - and that isn't all. US failure to support its ally persuades other Asian powers that they, too, must accommodate the rising China. Japan makes a deal with Beijing for security and autonomy, in return agreeing to close all US bases. A reunified Korea, swept up by nationalist sentiment, also expels the Americans. China effectively dominates the entire region. "An Asia it dominates but does not conquer or occupy is China's goal," the study says.<br></span><br><br><span style="color: darkred;">However, although China has a growing economy that will help its advancement to be an economic powerhouse, it may not reach super-power status on the same terms as USA.<br><br>This is largely due to its population size that will tax the budget to ensure continued development that will benefit the lives of China's population.<br><br>Its corrupt government system at the lower levels will prevent economic wealth from reaching every corner of China, and it will need deeper reforms to its legal and financial system to take advantage of its entry into the World Trade Organisation, and bring its economy on par, so as to compete with the rest of the World.<br><br>China will need to relook at its Political System that embraces Communism, even as it moderate the Communist System of Central Planning with Capitalistic Methods in capitalising on Market Forces.<br><br>By revamping its political system to allow for broader changes to liberal creativity, enterprise and transparency in all aspects of economic and political activities, China's growth will be significantly deeper and broader.<br><br>This will allow for a bigger and more meaningful military budget that will capitalize on the technological growth and development in commerce and industries, which is largely brought into China by Foreign Investments.<br><br>China may yet be a super power that can match the USA, but it will depend on the will of its system to accept change.<br><br>Since the opening of its doors to the world in 1978, China has accumulated a National Reserve of over US$200 Billion, which makes it third in size after Japan.<br><br>Recommended interesting sites for general reading:<br></span><br><br><strong>China: the Emerging Superpower </strong><br>by Major H.A.

We don't need the U.N. anymore we are the worlds only superpower with the greatest alliance (NATO) in history. The United States could use this money much wiser than funding the giant beuracracy that is the U.N. We could fix our own problems and then go and help the world. Only this time everyone would be depending on us and not the U.N. Countries would be a lot more greatful to America if we didnt give all the credit to the U.N.<br><br>I believe the United States should stop worrying about world opinion and just do things that are in the best interests of America, which is for the greater good of mankind. The world should just trust our good judgement as the greatest nation on Earth. America is the beacon of hope in this world.
