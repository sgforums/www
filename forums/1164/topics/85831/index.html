The beacon could have been triggered manually or upon impact.<br><br>The ELB can send signals up to a radius of eight kilometres. Jabu said the signal was coming from primary forest about 8km from the Sarawak-Kalimantan border and about 30km from Ba'Kelalan.<br><br>"The signal was very strong," he said at a Press conference at the Hornbill Skyways operations centre today.<br><br>It was first picked up at 2.30pm by a Malaysia Airlines twin-otter plane flying over on the way to Bario.<br><br>Almost immediately, the signal was picked up by a Hornbill Bell helicopter conducting an air search in the vicinity. The signal was picked up for the third time several minutes later by a police helicopter.<br><br>As soon as the message was relayed to search-and-rescue operations centres in Ba'Kelalan and Bario, a large ground search party, including seven commandos, was despatched to the area. They are expected to reach the site later tonight.<br><br>However, in Bario, Chan said no distress signals had been detected.<br><br>Instead, he told reporters late this evening that air surveillance units had detected two jungled areas near the Sarawak-Kalimantan border that had been damaged, possibly by an aircraft crashing through.<br><br>He said the site was not far from Ba'Kelalan, and that a search team had been sent to the area. It was expected to reach the site at midnight.<br><br>More than 1,000 people, including paramedics, doctors, soldiers, volunteers and Kelabit and Lun Bawang, are involved in the search-and-rescue operation.<br><br>The seven were travelling to the highlands to survey potential sites for the construction of a mini-hydro dam to generate electricity for the more than 5,000-strong Kelabit and Lun Bawang communities there.<br></div>
