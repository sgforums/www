Stop using that " oh-I'm-a-victim-of-unfair-situtations" routine. it's getting as worn out as the other equally ineffective methods used by your politicans up north. Want to know something? <strong>Who cares?</strong> Your kind of behaviour and attitude attracts no sympathy from anyone, you deserve what you get... actually, I think you deserve more, pple are just too nice or far more too important to bother with you. But no, of course you have to make yourself get noticed, be to turn a quote around "A pimple that will not burst". I think people here have tolerated your nonsense here enough, and I say jolly good show when you get flamed, you're just reaping what you sowed in here, and have no one to blame but yourself...<br><br>Does the prodigal son come back to his father with an attitude and demanding rights?
