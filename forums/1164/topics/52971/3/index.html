            <div class='col-md body'>Not too sure if the flying display Chinook was a SD, the static one was though.<br><br>I know we should wait for AA for full acrobatics, but I was hoping for more acrobatics from the flying segment, a couple of loops and rolls from the A-4s, F-5s and Vipers surely wouldn't have hurt? Rather than some simple (relatively) low speed passes<br><br>As for the commemorative book, while the $12 price tag is nice, the content was a bit on the disappointing side, some nice Peter Steinemann photos among others, but has its share of poorly taken ones, grainy, underexposed, overexposed...and the dust cover looks kind of flimsy, but I guess I'm just spoilt by the standards set by the 20th and 25th anniversary books.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>was at the open house on friday, yeah, with all the school GIRLS!! WOO..<br>anyways...<br>I found the open house to be most informative... the ppl there are willing to answer any question.  Almost.<br><br>I climbed into the Viper C's cockpit, and found it to be identical to the cockpit of Falcon 4.0.  No sweat finding all the switches for ramp start.. hehe.<br><br>Then i visited the simulators and caught a ride on both the Viper E/F and Hornet simulator.  Got 2 kills with Amraams and came in for a nice landing.  Couldn kill anything for the hornet simulator though... it was just an outright carrier landing.  Great fun. =D<br><br>The aerial display was not so fantastic though, except by the solo by Maj. Joseph, i think... That one was pretty cool, he looped over the runway, then pulled a 6g turn around.   Not fancy, but better than the usual boring stuff.<br><br>Oh yeah, and according to one of the technicians there, the RSAF has already chosen the F-16E/F... well...</div>
