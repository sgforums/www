            <div class='col-md body'>A list of weapons that I feel should not have been bought:<br>Of course, let me stress that its only a personal view. Some may not even count as blunders but of course we all strive for the best.<br><br><span style="color: red;">SAR-21 Assault Rifles:</span><br>A better choice would be to produce German G36 assault rifles under license. Not that I know about any teething problems associated with the G36. Has most, if not all of the capabilities of the SAR-21 and comes at a reduced weight. It is reliable, hard hitting and accurate. Easy for old timers like us to convert from the M16S1 due to the conventional layout too.<br><br><span style="color: red;">Vastergotland SSKs:</span><br>No doubt that the 2 upgraded Vastergotlands bought by the RSN are extremely capable boats. But a more straightforward approach would be to simply buy a class of 4 new-built Gotland class, keeping in mind that the 2 remaining Sjoormens need replacement before long and we would bear the burden of having to support an additional type of replacement submarine.<br><br><span style="color: red;">Quad SA-18 SAMs on M113 APCs:</span><br>A novel, low cost solution indeed. Probably effective against low level air threats but a more effective solution will be needed against higher level threats. A system in the class of the Russian SA-15 will be needed. (Not that I advocate buying Russian arms, but a more capable system with a full range of sensors and 8 missiles per unit is advisable)<br><br>*Will add more in later posts</div>

Apparently when the planes were delivered to the polytechnics, several micro cracks were found on the roots of the wings. However, it is actually a good upgrade as it would be a lot more expensive to buy new planes.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I think nearly everyone here is agreed that the close partnership between STK and its main patron the SAF is invaluable.<br><br>So even if some procurement from STK seems more expensive or unsuitable, in the long run it is the best solution for Singapore.<br><br>This partnership resulted in STK being able to produce some excellent weapons for SAF. And economically great as it creates jobs and made sure some defense dollars still stayed at home.<br><br>The A4 upgrade is a good showcase of our aero engineering capability.<br><br>And IMO, the A4SU were excellent platforms, out-flying even the F5E Tiger II. I am really sorry they are retired.<br><br>Regarding the decision for SAF to commission a locally-designed and built AR, I feel it is definitely the right one. We have the technology, the capability and the machinery to build an AR. We just need some help.<br><br>That the result was a bullpup SAR-21 may be slightly disagreeable to some (like me), but nonetheless, this is better than license-building.</div>

Some of these generals and colonels are a little out of touch with reality.<br><br>The trouble of course is that there must be sufficient discourse between user and service provider to ensure things work in the end.<br><br>If by anything, most of the products designed by ST/DSTA/DSO have largely been attempts to increase the knowledge and know-how of the industry so that we won't be wholely dependent on external sources for equipment. The artillery guns of the SAF was a result of reverse engineering I think an Israeli Soltam gun and allowed us to make some pieces of artillery which have served us somewhat well, though I haven't actually handled the guns before unless people here care to illuminate.<br><br>With regard to the Submarines, I don't quite understand why we had to do a step by step process towards procurement and if we started off with good boats and spent adequate time training with the Germans, we would have been able to operate them sooner. It is unlikely we will be able to build out boats any time soon, as Submarines require a fair bit more work than ships and we don't have the equipment i think to make the steel of the required tensile strength and to roll it to form the hull.</div>

Not that I know about any teething problems associated with the G36. Has most, if not all of the capabilities of the SAR-21 and comes at a reduced weight. It is reliable, hard hitting and accurate. Easy for old timers like us to convert from the M16S1 due to the conventional layout too.</div></blockquote>SG always wanted to able to sell their produced weapons so not just rely on only sales to SAF, licensed production of G36 might not allow us to export it.<br><br>STK's foreign sales will ensure that it is be a viable biz entity , not just relying on local sales.<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by ^Delta^:</div><div class="quote_body"><span style="color: red;">Vastergotland SSKs:</span><br>No doubt that the 2 upgraded Vastergotlands bought by the RSN are extremely capable boats. But a more straightforward approach would be to simply buy a class of 4 new-built Gotland class, keeping in mind that the 2 remaining Sjoormens need replacement before long and we would bear the burden of having to support an additional type of replacement submarine.</div></blockquote>Let say RSN is to maintain a 4 boats sgn, then having 2 new one and 2  older one sound logical.<br><br>All 4 of the same class of sub will be easier for training , maintainance and general logistics support.<br><br>But you see SSKs need major upgrade or replacement perhaps every 2 decades, so if we bought 4 at the same time, 2 decades later we will either have major upgrade or replacement for all 4 of them at the same time frsme which means another major financial outlay.<br><br>Or we could staggered such thing by two newer subs and two older one.<br><br>The Swedish offer give us opportunity to do so, the 2 upgraded Vastergotland subs let's say deliver to us by 2008, it mean they will not need any major overhual till 2028, and we still keep 2 of the Challenger class till 2018 which by then we should be looking at two new subs(either A26, U212 etc) ready to replace them.<br><br>In this way , we always always have at least 2 subs that are modern &amp; are not near the end of svc life where major overhual or replacement is required.<br><br>It is rumoured that we are having observer status for the A26 project, which should be ready in the middle of next decade, which is abt time for us to junk the Challenger.<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by ^Delta^:</div><div class="quote_body"><span style="color: red;">Quad SA-18 SAMs on M113 APCs:</span><br>A novel, low cost solution indeed. Probably effective against low level air threats but a more effective solution will be needed against higher level threats. A system in the class of the Russian SA-15 will be needed. (Not that I advocate buying Russian arms, but a more capable system with a full range of sensors and 8 missiles per unit is advisable)<br><br></div></blockquote>Well, as you said it, low cost, Igla was chosen becos of that and we are licensed porducing them locally.<br><br>They are meant to support ground troops, atm we dun need better one becos of our superioty of our AF as compare to other AF in the region,</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Actually SAR 80 is easier to clean ( piston driven), and less IA as compare to M-16.<br><br>But it is heavier, less ergonomical.<br><br>So it does not represent a great improvement over the M-16S1 but certainly not crap, otherwise it would not have any sales.</div>

Its a very common practice even in the private sector when it comes to equipment purchases.<br><br>Regarding the Igla and air defense, I differ.  An IADS should not be too reliant on one component, (eg in this case, fixed air).  We are not like the USAF with a large pool of resource and manpower.<br><br>Manpads and Shorads have a sufficiently important role to deny and defend against an air attack to deserve constant upgrades.  However, at the moment, I'd think the Igla is a reliable enough to serve that purpose.<br><br>What we ought to consider IMO, are mechanised shorads like the Tunguska M1.  Perhaps even a locally developed one built out of the BX or BX2 chassis.  It should provide a deadlier mobile AA cover for our advancing armored units.  A gun system provides versatility against targets with better counter measure systems.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Yeah try cleaning 8 barrels + vehicle+ mg + missle launcher + engine...nsf/ns men will curse you for your suggestions.<br><br>That aside, the igla has good enough coverage for armour ops. 4 missiles ready to fire to engage 2 flying targets + ifv mg fire + tank canister + 25 mm = alot of projectiles in the air while the armour run away and call for CAP.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>A reliable basic firearm is the most basic requirement for any army. Take the reliability of the Ak-47 which gave the US troops armed with M16s in Vietnam such a nightmare. We cannot compromise defence just to give our local defence industry more market power. Sadly, in the world nowadays, many of such factors are taken in account when procuring weapons.<br><br>And the case of SA-18s being sufficient for our ground troops, it is prudent to note that even a single enemy warplane which gets through the screen of fighters armed with cluster munitions or even no frills HE bombs can kill more then a few of our good men on the ground. There is no excuse for having a top notch air force and a comparatively light SAM coverage for our troops.<br><br>Imagine in a shooting war, when some of our comrades are killed by some lucky enmemy aircraft, we would be cursing at why there is no better SAM coverage. SA-18s are good against low flying helicopters and warplanes. They are about as useful as stones when pitted against Su-30s flying at high altitudes equipped with the latest jammers and electronic countermeasures.</div>
