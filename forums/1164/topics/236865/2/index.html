On a note, i thought the Tung M1s AA guns are 4 on each side?  Hence what i meant by 8 barrels.<br><br>and i know how our armour works hence why i said the igla's good enough in the earlier scenario(it's against helis, less likely vs low flying aircraft) i'm wrong about calling in cap, yes i know what aerial conditions(neutral/clear skies) are set as when we do the "stuff" i mixed up with calling for cas...entirely different thing.<br><br>I have seen the igla thingy it aint top notch but i have a feeling it's already an upgrade vs nothing in the past especially to the lower echelons. I do hope we get something better in the future. Yeah i meant since we can make iglas locally and then maybe we can make a much better sam with r&amp;d by ourselves.</div>

I forgot what they said about the subs but it's something like almost as good with new tech (aip) and much cheaper, better than anything else in the region.  As for the F-15s, it would be the most advance ones in the world when those land on our shores. It's a hi-lo aircraft mix.  F-16s for the cap/cas (dogfighting?). F-15s for the air superiority(Aesa, bvvr engagements correct me if i'm wrong) and Deep strikes (very long range + huge payloads)  Just imagine a F-16D with TWO engines... heh.<br><br>As for the SAR-21 it has it's quirks but it sure fits great in the matchbox! Besides you can rambo with one hand!  Anyway the sar debate is on another thread so excuse my ranting!</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Well thats what my teacher told me about the cracks, not sure if they used X-Rays (or some radiowave thing) to check it out. But its also common knowledge that the F-404 engine was overpowered for the old airframe. Nonetheless, it improved the performance drastically.<br><br>Most of the pilots still love the Skyhawk citing its like driving a sportscar. I too love it because of its shape.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Im considered a relatively tall fella but i feel that the SAR-21's length is very good. I personally feel that the M-16 is too long. im 1.80m in height.<br><br>Well perhaps i prefer compact weapons then again who doesnt? In a modern Urban setting, M-16s are too long for effective room clearing. Its hard to swivel around quickly but of course anyone can argue that it is a formidable weapon in the right hands but for a citizen army such as ours, easy to use is key and thats where the SAR-21 shines.<br><br>To me I dont think its as big a flop as retiring the Hueys. The SP pilots are way overworked. With so many choppers gone, the CH-47s and SPs have to cover their work and the pilots fly more hours than any other aircraft a week.<br><br>This isnt a procurement blunder but more like a retiring blunder. the RSAF should have gotten replacement choppers first, need not cover 1 for 1 but at least a few would be good.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>There's far more to procurement then simply getting the best and biggest guns at the moment... else you might end up like a certain northern country that has a mess of different weapons systems that is a nightmare to keep up with.<br><br>One has to consider the politics, economics and what have you not of the weapons you are buying. You can get the best fighter jet but it ends up costing you a bomb and you realize you lack the skills and manpower to support it... you would find it a lot less useful then if you had used your brains a little and thought through it a little more.<br><br>The merits and quirks of the SAR-21 has been discussed quite a lot in another thread, it would make for an interesting read once you get past some of the heated debate.<br><br>But AFAIK, there does not seem to be any real reason to consider the weapon a flop once all things have been considered. The additional weight of the weapon comes from the nick nacks that in the standard variant and all things factored it the weapon isn't obese compared to it's other counterparts (in fact it is often <span style="font-style: italic;">lighter</span>). As for bullpup versus conventional it is another debate altogether. I am a bullpup person though, and I like the weapon pretty much.<br><br>But going for German rifles? Sure they are popular but given the way things currently are, there is no reason to sub out the SAR-21 for the H&amp;K. I believe one of the things that made the SAR extremely attractive to the SAF was that it was extremely cost effective for the features it provides.<br><br>As for the Igla, I think the rationale behind it went that it has a similar preformance envelope to the Stinger (which was also considered) but was a lot cheaper. Hence by using  two Iglas together one gets a higher hit rate then the Stinger at a lower cost... but at a cost in mobility though. But Manpads knocking down Su-30s at high altitude and speed? I'm not sure any Manpad in the world can do it reliably.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I am not sure if what you folks mention as blunders !!!<br><br>First A4- skyhawk<br>I happend to talk to the pilots who flew them, I can tell you non of them want to trade it with a hawk 200 ! With the upgrade, they basically even out manuover the f-5 !!! If the pilots who flew it feel it is good, then why we call it a blunder based on some hear say of some folks.<br><br>SAR-21 Assault Rifles:<br>If it been review by top defense magzine, and give top points by gun expert. Also remember the SAR-21 has different version, just because you do not like the standard version as some feel it is heavier does not mean it is not a good design.  Basically I have feedback from reservist who just did their shooting, they all say, their shooting have improve with SAR-21. Also it do away with zeroing. So i do not think it is blunder.<br><br>Vastergotland SSKs:<br>Basically Singapore did the right choice, buy some old sub as cheap training subs first, save the money and wait to see if there is some new tech sub that is more suitable in future.  Why should we jump in to buy new gotland and let new birds bang it around, better wait , which i see viking sub is the more interesting choice for us.<br><br>Quad SA-18 SAMs on M113 APCs<br>M113 upgraded have very good manuvourability. Also SA-18 are very very effective , cheap and good. What the problem with it ? As long as it can do the job and good.<br><br>F-15,<br>It beat the competition - range, radar, weapon range, endurance, power, weapons load ....... so what so people say - a eurofighter will outturn it ? Can the eurofighter outturn missile from F-15 ?<br><br></div>

I think most will buy cheaper car and test run first. Instead of getting a ferrari straightaway, op to buy a WRX first. Test test and see how it goes and let 'your kid' familiarise with a sportscar first.<br><br>I personally dont see how the F-15T/SG is a blunder. Combat proven, state-of-the-art and a menace in the sky. Singapore is known to buy their weapons smartly and I think on this case it is. Old shape but its materials is very different from the older models.</div>

Anyway, the main structure were strengthened and primary structure like the wing spars (front and rear spars) were also replaced during the upgrading.

Dispensing of IRCMs such as flares is common and in some cases done on intervals due to the nature of IR-missiles such as Igla. (for low flying CAS aircraft)  Hence, pK for unprotected fighters is hardly a good measure.  When the aircraft comes in low, they will be dispensing flares and chaff in and out.<br><br>eg.  When attacking, they will be dispensing CMs at intervals.  On weapon release, they'd climb and dispense larger quantities at shorter intervals.  Hence, you really have to catch the pilot napping in order to use statistics for unprotected fighter targets.</div>
