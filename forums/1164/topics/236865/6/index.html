But in the end we got the Ultra upgraded i believe Mindef didnt proceed on with more of the AMX 10.  Those babies are probably more expensive as well.  In the end, we upgraded our SM1 and got the 25mm ows.. it's a much better and cheaper solution. Is it a blunder?

We locally produce it, and parts availabilty and maintenance would be a lesser issue.  Remember, the BX has a LOT of M113s to replace, so cost effective is a definite must.<br><br>Width issues.  3m is good width for manuoevering in plantations.  Anything broader, and it might cause a bit of a jam. And there are a lot of plantations in northland.  My feel is this.  Plantations offer firm soil for armor vehicles to move on because of the roots of the trees there.<br><br>Same for gun length.  You really don't want ur gun to have difficulty traversing in a firefight in plantations.  But common logic also dictates you need to traverse fast, so tank destroyers are out of the question.<br><br>As for Primus, I don't think I can comment much without divulging sensitive information.  But if u read the above 2 paragraphs, and apply some open source knowledge of how SPHs operate, you'll get the idea.<br><br></div>

In late 2004 Finland made another purchase, bringing the overall quantity ordered to over 100.[1]<br><br>In December 2005 Denmark ordered 45 CV9035 vehicles for a cost of <strong>Â€188 </strong>million (<strong>8.35mil SGD per unit</strong>). Info in Danish:[2]<br><br>Land Systems HÃ¤gglunds announced in December 2005 that the Netherlands ordered 184 CV9035 with a contract value of Â€749 million (<strong>8.14mil SGD per unit</strong>). Deliveries will take place between 2007 and 2010</blockquote>Note it's roughly <strong>1 Euro = 2.01680 Singapore Dollar </strong>and <strong>1 Euro = 1.32886 US Dollar </strong><br><br>In some cases we might be paying more then the cost of one refurbished M1A1 Abrams tank for each CV90, and comparable to a brand new M1A2 at 8.6mil SGD (assuming the Yanks ever decide to sell them to us). Lame example I know, but I think the underlying premise is clear enough to all of us...<br><br>Considering these are the most recent CV90 "happy meal" packages...<br><br>Hmm...<br><br>I think we'll stick with the Bx.</div>

Though the CV90 is a respectable AFV, the cost to replace M113s with CV90s would be too high.  Then there is upkeep to think about.  Of course, unless the swedes decide to sell us the design and allow us to locally manufacture them, then it would be a different story.<br><br>Of course, i wasn't suggesting that a palm tree plantation had trees planted 3m  apart.  Remember that vehicles require a turning radius to make a turn on the move as well.  And there is definitely a margin provided given the &lt;3m specification.   And before you can reply, no, it is not wise for armored vehicles to stop and turn on a the spot.<br><br>And if you do some calculations based on a 9m distancing plantation, you'll realize that when manuevering and approaching from an angle, the narrowest distance apart from tree to tree is only 4.5m.  So there is merit to the 3m specification.<br><br>360 traverse: Can you tell me why a SPH needs to be able to traverse 360, or even fire its gun away from its front instead? It is an artillery weapon, not an armored fighting vehicle.  You say that its has proven its value in combat in vietnam, perhaps you can show us an article or two that an SPH has to consistently make use of its ability to traverse its turret 360?  It is like arguing  that the aircraft cannon has "real" value in modern air combat when it is only employed in limited situations this day and age.<br><br>I don't believe there are much facts to be refuted.  What you mention are true but in context of the SAF, they are irrelevant.</div>

In fact we have had so many threads on this that itÂ’s a mystery to me why you havenÂ’t picked up on it. By and far the SAF likes its units to be within these limits.<br><br>It is no secret that for some time the SAF was trying to figure out a workable solution to the MBT question by generating units to fit that role within the armour requirements until it was realized that a suitable counterpart counter to the Twardies could not be currently accomplished within these specs... That became clear when even the Yanks were trying to figure out an FCS MBT concept that were similar to the SAF requirements but have yet to make it work.<br><br>Hence in this case actually having a useful thing is far better then having something that fit into the traditional requirements, but was far less useful in its intended role. This demonstrates the flexibility in the procurement thinking and efforts of the SAF, however you seem to think that the exception proves the ruleÂ… or worse, ride them to their illogical extreme.<br><br>Do our armour guys in here a favour will you? And actually proper acquaint yourself with SAF armour and procurement before going about your next few points.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br></div>
