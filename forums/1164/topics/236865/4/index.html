A lot I wud think . If you look at Bionix for instance, most of the critical and high value systems are purchased off the shelve.  If one adds up the costs of the Bushmaster, firecontrol system, engine, tracks , suspension,  armor etc they probably account for more than 80 % ( if not more  ) of the value of the Bionix.  Also, one must add the infrastructure to design &amp; build these systems - they also cost lots of money.<br><br>M16s are built by the million and AK47s by the scores of millions. How many SAR21s can we build for the SAF ? 0.1 million  ?   Economies of scale say it all - these locally developed systems cannot be had on the cheap !<br><br></div></blockquote>Seeing one side of the coin again?<br><br>So are you implying that we are far better off dropping off all of our R&amp;D and sinking all the cash into getting off the shelf systems like other countries in the region?<br><br>Truth is I don't think that's the way to go for Singapore... one of the key aspects to our survival and credibility comes not simply from having the cash to spend on stuff, but having the stuff that money cannot immediately buy. The simple math of the whole thing is that no matter how much cash we sink into off-the-shelf systems that anybody can buy all it takes is for somebody to outspend us... worse if they have more resources in land and manpower and are willing to spend on buildup. We can't really sustain a force parity simply by relying on buying our stuff off the shelf.<br><br>A lot of the technology that we need to maintain a proper force multiplier over potential opponents are simply not obtainable via main market systems. Looking at it this way, nations like South Africa, South Korean and even Japan see it fit to create their own weapons systems (Japan and SK have their own MBTs and are planning for the next generation of systems) when by many measures the defence industry is not really their main method of generating GDP... are they being silly given they could just buy off-the-shelf?<br><br>Let's not even forget about Israel... should they have spent all the money they blew on developing the Merky, Tavor and all those other local systems that have yet to find any place in the international market on off-the-shelf systems?<br><br>You are grossly underestimating the value of R&amp;D. This is not to mention that you pointed out, but failed to notice the significance of the fact that we often repurpose other people's R&amp;D for our own ends... so it is as much a modifying foreign technology to fit our needs as it is a learning experience.<br><br>It would be odd if we decided on a whim to design a new 25mm cannon for the Bionix when we already had proper systems to work with. But it's another thing to say that it's better altogether to just use the Bradley... which was considered, but finally rejected.<br><br>If you haven't noticed, the SAF does mixes and matches the way we get our weapons. Those that we can buy we buy, if we can modify it we modify. If we really need a capability that we cannot buy, we are willing to spend to create it ourselves. Is the spending justified? I certainly think so.<br><br>And what's with your nonsenscial point about millions of M16s and AKs manufactured worldwide versus what a small red dot can churn out? Do you not realize that since the SAF was young our mainstay infantry weapon, the M16 has but been manufactured right here in Singapore for the fact that we simply could NOT GET ENOUGH from off the shelf back then?<br><br>For the record, given we have already been manufacturing our M16S1s locally and it has always been the way we have kept our armies supplied with arms... so what's with your nonsense with not being able to make enough weapons with the switch to SAR-21? The infrastructure to manufacture arms had always been present since the industralization of our nation, you make it seem as if we just recently built it up from scratch.<br><br>The per unit cost of the SAR-21 factoring all the development costs and what have you not will certainly be cheaper in the long run then if we were getting some foreign off-the-shelf system. That bit is clear enough from the moment the whole project was started... which was the point of it to begin with.<br><br>I'm not sure what you are trying to do except to try to draw some argument from thin air.<br><br>And what makes you think there are only 100,000 SAR-21s in the SAF?<br><br>Given this fact, it is obvious that locally manufacturing some weapons systems is justified in the economic sense. Is this really protectionism? Or a just case of <span style="font-style: italic;">locallymademustsuckitis</span>?<br><br>I think for all their blunders our government is that not silly... they would not waste years and billions on creating locally made weapons just for the fun of it. Not that all our procurement efforts are perfect... but to say that R&amp;D is unneeded and to rely on whatever some other company in some other country with very different defence needs happens to think up of seems to be national suicide to me.</div>

Can see you are a total zero on it. Singapore may be small in size, but it is sizable player in the arms market.  You keep assuming Singapore, keeping its product and expertize in Singapore only, but you did not see the oversea sales !!! Thus me it is huge.<br><br>You bring up the bionix, well since nothing is suitable we manufacture it by combining the best of all part, so what wrong with that ? We learn from all the best equipment and intergrate them. Well if over 200 bionix is not economic of scale enough for you ? You think people sell you a arm vehicle  so cheaply without including development cost, and all other cost ? dream on.<br><br>SAR-21 is sold to singapore army ? You can be assure that it is more then 0.1 million in singapore alone !!! Oversea sales, did you aware that sar-21 is been sold oversea also ? Just because you not oversea to buy it, does not mean there is no sales. SAR-80 and SR-88 and ultimax 100 have all had very good sales !!! Just because you do not know about it.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>R&amp;D on small arms, ammo, pgms, armour plate/nanotech technology, NCW/BMS stuffs makes alot of sense to me.<br><br>But APCs and other platforms are just nothing more than specialised trucks. One can get Marders or Centurions and lots of surplus to modify or upgrade.<br><br>Larger weapons(like howitzers) actually their effectiveness dictated by the munitions (plus the NCW) that come out of it rather than the barrel and running gear it posses.<br><br>Suitability of one hardware to our requirements actually is decided by the mindsets of the evaluators. I don't think there's such a think as unsuitable hardware but rather the inflexibility of those that will operate them.<br><br>My 2 cents.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I think the aim of local arms industries is to ensure a viable production line that can at least sustain us in a wartime situation where we may not get resupply of parts from our commercial partners from abroad.<br><br>It's called Plan B, and one that has been moderately successful. Think Spartan and the US Navy. Increasingly, we have a lot of bilateral R&amp;D that have been moved on to producing stuff that is used in actual combat by major powers.<br><br>If you have indigenous capability, you can customise COTS equipment.

            <div class='col-md body'>Bravo and well said. One might grudgingly accept what Glock has to say if he had chosen the right battles to fight in here but it seems that each and every move made by him seems specifically intended to corner himself into an unwinnable position. A habit that many here find both annoying and somewhat amusing, but we would all rather do without.<br><br>ItÂ’s quite obvious that his whole song-and-dance about our locally procured weapons project is mostly snake oil, given this is not only an industry that has existed since the formative periods of our nation, but had actually <span style="font-style: italic;">grown</span> considerably to what we have today. If it was really such a cost-incurring and unnecessary exercise as he makes it out to beÂ… one would expect the billions of dollars we waste in such things yearly actually make its serious effects felt. By all measures it seems that what is actually happening on the ground is defying all or most of him points, and to insist on them seems to me a rather futile battle on his part.<br><br>I'm rather interested how Glock actually forms his "case"... does he actually look at the ground, gather all the facts and form a conclusion from that or does he simply go by his "gut" feel on any topic and gathers whatever loose scraps of information to support that? I have a feeling it's the latter.<br><br>If it provides jobs, helps tool our industry, allows us to gain a vital knowledge base, and equips our troops with decent equipment at the end of the day... what exactly then is the problem?<br><br>Spending money just to get guns, or spending money to create jobs, gain knowledge, and tool our industry and get guns for our troops... which is a better use of our limited resources?<br><br>More then enough indeed has been said.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>In a way, I can agree with what Glock said about the M-16 being lighter.  Its design is such that the weight of the weapon would be distributed between 2 hands nicely.<br><br>The Sar-21, being a more compact bullpup, has its weight distribution slightly centralised.  Hence, the right hand seems to be support the bulk of the weight.  Hence, to me, when I last handled it, also felt a bit weighty.<br><br>For that, I guess I would blame it on the fact that I was unfamiliar with the Sar-21 and was more used to the M-16.<br><br>What I REALLY liked about SAR-21 is the speed one can really acquire and aim steadily at a target.<br><br>What I REALLY liked about the M-16, is the combat loading.

            <div class='col-md body'>I just don't get you Glock... are you really serious about this? Or are you just deliberately being silly?<br><br>Hey a tip: use proper quote tags so people can tell which are your points and which are somebody else's. If not it actually looks like you had suddenly flipped flopped on your position or worse, developed a split personality. Here, you can learn from this post:<br><br><blockquote> How do YOU know ?</blockquote>Try some basic common sense and seeing the big pictureÂ… it works.<br><br>More seriously, I am rather interested to see how YOU know your positions are valid. Because you have failed to put just any proper justification for them at all, what it seems you are doing here is to raise questions (and mostly silly ones that can be avoided with a bit of common sense) on your opponents questions.<br><br>But yes, can you prove that procuring foreign arms would be more cost-effective (just like your armoured 5-tonner mathematics perhaps?) and more beneficial to our economy, security, strategic position and technological ability then local procurement of what systems we had so far? If not then you should really shut up, because you jolly be quiet until you have have a better idea instead of talking about things you barely understand.<br><br><blockquote>Right, but how high is our numerical requirement compared to other armed forces ? We have a bigger requirement than other armed forces in countries which are developing their own weapons ? </blockquote>Â…<br><br>Whatever are you talking about? Can you at the very least do a bit of your homework before posting something like this in here? Do you even know basic economics?<br><br>The numerical requirement (high or low) is made relevant by locally proportional demand and supply. Just because Gardenia cannot match the whole bread production and supply of the USA does not mean that it would not be justified, nor profitable, for it to bake bread for local requirements.<br><br>And more importantly you not considering other tangibles and intangibles that people have raised. If you insist on only seeing one possible track of justification, then please donÂ’t blame people for failing to convince you.<br><br><blockquote>Next is , where does the all the money go to if SG govt bought weapon from locally produced ST Engg's weapons?</blockquote>Are you deliberately asking silly questions or are you really that selectively ignorant? I find such the level of ignorance demostrated in your one-liner rebuttals rather difficult to believe.<br><br>Please do use a bit of common senseÂ… if you pay the auntie at a local kopitiam $3 for your ba chor mee when does it ultimately have end up?<br><br>If you went to Japan and paid the Sushi uncle 500 yen (converted from your SGD) for sushiÂ… when does it ultimately end up?<br><br>On to other things:<br><br>Are people scraping the bottom of the barrel to suggest the SAR-21 is well accepted? They are just pointing out that we are not the only ones to see value in the weapon, which is quite a remarkable achievement given the saturated small arms market, that the rifle was primarily designed first and foremost for local requirements, and never intended to be an export world-beater.<br><br>Consider that many supposedly brilliant small arms designs never made it out of local borders despite attempts to foray into export. Why so harsh on the SAR?<br><br>If we fail to export other systems like the Primus or CIS .50 does it mean that they are primarily flawed? Of course then the question shifts to if we should be making our own stuff even if they are not fundamentally inadequate weaponsÂ…<br><br></div>

Your self-defence strategy consists a lot more then just giving and blocking blows, it should be an entire system that reaches out even before the blow is struck.<br><br>This means that if making mere weapons provide strategic benefits not related to its basic functionÂ… it would still be well and justified to do so. In fact not doing so would be folly.<br><br>So if you can booster your own economy, security, and technological prowessÂ… at the same time while spending locallyÂ… indeed why buy off the shelf when you can develop similar capabilities and even more benefits by doing your own homework? It would seem rather silly not to do so. We do not burn down Creative just because Microsoft is bigger and more widespread.<br><br>So what is your point (or idea)? That unless we cannot come up with something like the F-22 or something really special R&amp;D has no place with us and we ought to be doing some rather wild things like dissolving the local arms industry and subjecting our defence needs to the profit margins and supply trains of foreign developers?<br><br>Indeed, what exactly are you suggesting? Your cost-saving ideas donÂ’t seem to save any costs- in fact they would lead to financial and security disastersÂ… which seem to me very strategic things.<br><br>You said that our resources are being wasted on R&amp;D- well people have showed quite clearly that R&amp;D is actually <span style="font-style: italic;">adding</span> to our resources and economy. Conversely they pointed out the detrimental effects of an overt reliance on the shelf for our arms needs.<br><br>You questioned if there were any strategic rationale for local weapons procurement- well they already pointed out the strategic reasons as well.<br><br>So what exactly is your concern?<br><br><blockquote> DonÂ’t give up now.</blockquote>IÂ’m going to take some time to address that one-liner.<br><br>Do you think you have the right to ask people to try harder to convince you when you have yet to convince anybody you are putting up even anything proper to be discussed? The fact that some choose to reply with such detailed and well-thought out information to your shoddy posts is quite remarkable to begin with.<br><br>In the court of law, would you dare to present your kind of defence versus what was raised? Please do not be mistaken- merely posting a one-liner or abrupt, dismissive sentence in response to all the responses and questions raised do not help your standing in here at all. At most it is just personal balm to your ego- but I think most people see through that.<br><br>If you want people to give you a break, then respect some basic laws of reason to begin with. Even if you find you canÂ’t win all you need to do is to stop posting- not post some one liner as an ego-boost but utterly fails to dislodge the weight of your opponentÂ’s arguments- it is for your own good. Not to mention drives you further down a path of error that you might someday look back on and consider yourself a fool.  If a man batters his head against the wall of logic and reality, guess who suffers and becomes insane in the end?<br><br>That was not an insult or challenge- please so some serious soul searching before your next post. If not, I really see no need for anybody in here to change their position or rebuttals to what you just postedÂ… because what you basically posted were your instinctive reactions, and not well thought out rebuttals at all.

We have a bigger requirement than other armed forces in countries which are developing their own weapons ?<br></blockquote><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br>Have you ever taken a course like Intro to Economics or something similar???<br><br>Higher qty does not neccesary equate higher return, your assumption show that you have no economics background, that is this term called Diminishing Marginal Returns.<br><br>So let's say requirement is able to fully utilised a production line, the average cost will be lowest i..e. optimise.<br><br>Increasing of production factor/s so to increase qty does not equate lower average cost, that is why it mean by Diminishing Marginal Returns of factor.<br><br>So if we are producing at the optimise qty for that production line.and<br><br>FC + VC &lt; Price of off the shelf weapon.<br><br>then it is worthwhile, that is only micro level and I am  not even talking Macro level yet!!!<br><br>For small arms , our number are high enough to venture into it.<br><br>You can see many countires designing and producing their own arms, why???<br><br>For economical and strategic benefits!<br><br><blockquote><br>Me : Next is , where does the all the money go to if SG govt bought weapon from locally produced ST Engg's weapons?<br><br>High % of it will remain in SG, whereas buying off the shelf foreign weapon will be the complete opposite, so this good for our current account i.e. better economically for SG!!<br><br>Glock: If you read my post , a high percentage actually goes to foreign companies in some very high value SG developed systems such as the Bionix and Primus. Also , the Terrex was not developed by STK but by Timoney !<br><br></blockquote><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br>It is all depend on the level of indigenous part, if 10% is indigenous in term money value, that mean 10% will remain in SG.<br><br>Labour cost of assembly will also remain in SG.<br><br>Foreign off the shelf weapon will be 100% out of SG!!<br>( unless you have local middleman that take a cut like those in MY, then some do remain locally!!! <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"> )<br><br>As for Terrex, Timoney only provde us the drive train and suspension, if it is by  fully design by Timoney , then why STK is marketing Terrex and not Timoney???<br><br><blockquote><br>Me: This exactly why one condition of military aids to Israel by the US is that it could only be used to buy US produced weapon, they dun even mind they are Israeli deisgn weapon as long it is produced in US.<br>This will ensure the majority of the money of the military aids to Israel actually stay in US!!!<br><br>Glock : Does Singapore have a large political lobby in the USA as Israel does ? Obviously no.<br></blockquote>You dun understand the example that I have given, the point is to have job creation, prevent flow of funds out the country i.e. better current account.<br><br><blockquote>So which weapons systems we have produced gives us strategic benefits ?<br></blockquote>All weapons locally produced gives us strategic benefits!!!!<br><br>1) the qty is unknown unless we leaked it out<br><br>2) the capability is unknown, for example we may have some secret stuff in it that we dun want other to know abt.<br><br>For example BMS, armour protection of BX etc.<br><br>3)we could design weapon that fully meet our needs, Primus, BX are good example.<br><br>4) we are less vulnerable when face with a arms embargo than a country that have no arms industry at all.<br><br>5) we could rammed up production in time of tension, and have more weapon much more quicker than buy off the shelf.<br><br>6) there are weapons that you could not buy off the shelf becos no one is selling them, for example NCW system , some electronics warfare stuff etc.<br>Such high tech and highly sensitive stuff are best produce by ourselves, but to produce such stuff , we must have certain the technology knowhow, w/o a good R&amp;D and arms industry , we will not able to do so.<br><br>7) we hear all the time SG has silver bullets, secret projects etc, can we have such things if we buy everything off the shelf???<br><br></div>
