              <p>We can get the UN to start an international joint patrol, can tap into UN's funds which is mainly paid for by the developed nations. It is in their best interest to have safe shipping lanes. </p>
              <p>Most nations who have maritime trade will be directly or indirectly affected by piracy, further more it is in an area near to major shipping lanes.</p>
              <p>I mean the pirates already got a oil tanker and a ship carrying MBTs and lots of arms. Can you imagine if all these falls into terrorists hands? At least with pirates, they only want money but terrorists are fanatics, thus irrational and can be unpredictable. That can be a very dangerous scenario to deal with.</p>

              <p><em><strong>Warships rescue merchant vessels in Gulf of Aden</strong><br> <br><br> A NATO warship has prevented a swarm of more than a dozen pirate boats
                  from hijacking five merchant shipping vessels in the Gulf of Aden, the
                  alliance said in a statement.<br><br> Alerted by a distress call, the Italian navy destroyer put itself
                  between the ships and a group of pirate "fast boats", with all vessels
                  using water hoses to repel the pirates.<br><br> The Italian warship, Luigi Durand de la Penne, also used its helicopter
                  against the pirates, dispersing their attack, a NATO official said.<br><br> "This is probably the biggest multiple, coordinated attack we've seen,"
                  the official said, adding that more than 12 pirate boats were involved,
                  perhaps as many as 20.<br><br> "There were so many of them, that it was more important to protect the
                  motor vessels than to go after these dispersing boats," the official
                  said, on the sidelines of talks between NATO foreign ministers in
                  Brussels.<br><br> "These attacks are more and more brazen," he said, adding: "The bottom line is: this is a busy part of the world."<br><br> The vessels under threat were the Hambourg Star, flagged out of
                  Liberia, the Hong Kong registered Overseas Hercules, Iranian flagged
                  Iran Esteghlal, <strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">the Sea Queen from Singapore</span>,</strong> and the Alexander Sibum
                  flagged in Antigua and Barbuda.<br><br> NATO has four ships - from Britain, Greece, Italy and Turkey - on
                  patrol in the waters off Somalia, with two protecting UN food aid
                  convoys to the strife-torn Horn of Africa country.<br><br> The mission, NATO's first-ever against pirates, is commanded from
                  Naples, southern Italy. It will end in mid-December when a bigger
                  European Union operation - dubbed Atalanta - is to be put in place.<br><br> Somalia's Gulf of Aden and Indian Ocean waters have seen around 100
                  vessels attacked this year. The escalation threatens to choke one of
                  the world's busiest maritime routes.<br><br> - AFP</em></p>

Security Council were the first by a senior Chinese official confirming widespread speculation voiced in recent weeks.<br><br>The state-controlled press has been rallying support for such a mission with editorials that refer to China's "responsibility" as well as to what the English-language China Daily called an opportunity to "get into the thick of the action."

              <p>Hi all. I'm new here :) I'm just wondering, isn't it a bit tough using full-sized naval ships to handle pirates? It seems as if the Somali pirates are using small, heavily armed speedboats...not something a frigate or cruiser armed with big missiles and guns could take on easily. Conventional blue-water naval ships aren't really suited to the task. The speedboats'd be hard to detect, and one wouldn't have much use for Aster and Harpoon missiles in such a situation. True, naval gunfire could work, but if the speedboats were moving, it'd be tricky. (Finding the target could be a problem, though.)</p>
              <p>Worse, if they got in close, the ship'd not have much way to retaliate. Please correct me if I'm wrong, but I'm guessing that an LST-sized ship's going to have some blind spots where a fast boat could close, fire off a few RPGs, and run. Maybe the sailors could take pot shots at the pirates, but y'know.</p>
              <p>In my (uneducated  :P) opinion, it would make more sense to deploy helicopters and aircraft there (UAVs too) to scout large swathes of ocean, and shoot. That's what the EU force seems to be doing. The ships themselves aren't going into harm's way, but are acting more like floating helipads, command posts and barracks for marines and troops. Helicopters like the S-60 are probably useful as they can pack missiles and a boarding team.</p>
              <p>Besides, I guess this question is moot: politically, I doubt the Singapore government sees the need to do such a thing, and to the RSN the LSTs and Formidable class ships are too valuable to send into harm's way right now for such little gain. Logstics would be near-impossible too unless we get supplies from some other navy or port in the area.</p>
              <p>Still, Somalia's problems must be solved by a humanitarian solution, although gunboats are fun.</p>

              <p>so as long as you arent lionnoisy any form of input is welcomed and appreciated.</p>
              <p>hmm, helicopters do have their limitation and may not be used in all weather conditions (likewise the pirate vessels but thats another matter).</p>
              <p>USV or UAVs under shipboard launch and recovery may be difficult too.</p>
              <p>the CTF 158 scope of operations, is more of a show of force to deliver a deterrent effect rather than actually operations against the pilots. its to remind them that there is a stick ready to deal a big whack if the pirates pull off anything stupid. its defensive in nature and not offensive</p>
              <p>its the threat of the whack that the ships represent. not really so much of the stick. the task force will probably be there for another 6-8 months, pirates are sufficiently deterred and things should go back to normal.</p>
