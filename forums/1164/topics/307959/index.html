              <p><strong><span style="color: #0000ff;">GUNNING FOR THE BIG MONEY DIFFERENT GUNS FOR EVERY NEED<br></span></strong>By Ho Lian-yi <br>February 18, 2008</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>FORGET gold.</p>
              <p>Cold, hard steel may be the safest bet amid the global economic turmoil - especially if it is in the form of guns.</p>
              <p>While corporate profits of the world's top companies were shot up badly in recent months, defence firms continued to hit bigger earning targets, The Washington Post reported.</p>
              <p>Despite Singapore's size, our defence industry is a major global player in the arms arena, and it is gunning for an even bigger slice of the pie, with Singapore Technologies Kinetics leading the charge.</p>
              <p>The SAR 21 assault rifle and the Ultimax 100 Squad Automatic Weapon, both designed and made by ST Kinetics and used by the Singapore Armed Forces, have made a splash overseas.</p>
              <p>Mr Gaius Ho, ST Kinetics' corporate communications head, said <strong>more than 50,000 of both guns have been exported in their variant forms.</strong></p>
              <p>The company mainly sells arms to countries in South-east Asia, Africa and Latin America.</p>
              <p>To expand its reach, it has sales teams all over the world - a good move, considering how lucrative the defence business is.</p>
              <p>Just how lucrative? The proposed US defence budget for 2009 is US$515.4 billion ($727.7b), or 7.5 per cent higher than 2008's budget. That's more than double Singapore's GDP in 2006.</p>
              <p>It is also the biggest budget since the end of World War II, after adjusting for inflation, according to media reports.</p>
              <p>Last month, The New Paper on Sunday reported that the US Army is mulling over replacing its Colt M4 Carbine with the Heckler &amp; Koch HK416 as its main assault rifle.</p>
              <p>Good thing then that ST Kinetics, the land systems and specialty vehicles arm of STEngineering, is well-positioned to ride this surge in defence spending.</p>
              <p>The company has developed the Bionix armoured fighting vehicle, Bronco All Terrain Tracked Carrier and the CIS 40mm Automatic Grenade Launcher (CIS 40 AGL), among others.</p>
              <p><strong>Singapore is the second-biggest seller of AGLs in the world.</strong></p>
              <p><strong>It may also be the world's biggest producer of 40mm ammunition for AGLs, having exported more than three million in the last few years. </strong></p>
              <p>In 2006, it registered sales of over $1b.</p>
              <p>Last Thursday, ST Kinetics invited The New Paper on Sunday to its Boon Lay plant where we met Mr Lai Hon Nam, vice-president of Kinetics Marketing Group.</p>
              <p>Fittingly, the interview took place in the factory where an estimated 80 per cent of all rifles used in Singapore are made.</p>
              <p>Designing weapons for overseas markets can be a dirty business - literally.</p>
              <p>It involves going to field tests, squatting in jungle, desert and snow, listening to all sorts of customer demands.</p>
              <p>ST Kinetics has a team of 10 designers. Business is so good that the company is looking for more to join the team.</p>
              <p>Mr Lai said that to penetrate overseas markets, one has to develop weapons according to clients' needs.</p>
              <p>'Most of the requirements they throw at us, we have a solution,' said Mr Lai, who led the research team that developed the SAR 21 and the Ultimax 100.</p>
              <p>Using the two standard weapons as basic templates, they designed several variants, 'like a family tree', for their customers.</p>
              <p>Each tells a story. (See report above.)</p>
              <p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">NEW FIGHTING SCENARIOS</span></strong></p>
              <p>He said: 'Last time, there was only one scenario: Cold War fighting. Now, there are many scenarios.'</p>
              <p>Though different armed forces have different needs, Mr Lai noticed a common demand: lighter, smarter and more accurate weapons.</p>
              <p>This is the direction of the company's rifle designs.</p>
              <p>'Last time, 5kg was acceptable (for an assault rife), then it was 3kg. Now, it's 3kg with sights,' he said, adding that user safety is also a high priority.</p>
              <p>Another selling point is that ST Kinetics provides a complete solution, Mr Lai said. This means providing the third-party sights and the ammunition.</p>
              <p>But how does ST Kinetics compare to the big guns of the arms world, such as Heckler &amp; Koch, Beretta, Colt, Glock and Izhmash (makers of the AK-47)?</p>
              <p>Mr Lai said: 'We compete overseas and we see the companies that you mentioned.</p>
              <p>'The fact that we win says something.'</p>
              <p>ST Kinetics' will be showcasing its homegrown weaponry at the upcoming Singapore Airshow (19 to 24 Feb).<br>-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p>
              <p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">DIFFERENT GUNS FOR EVERY NEED</span></strong></p>
              <p><strong>SAR 21, ULTIMAX 100 VARIANTS</strong></p>
              <p><strong>SAR 21 Modular Mounting System Carbine</strong></p>
              <p>Usually used by special forces and some frontline units. Most flexible of the variants, with unique sighting systems.</p>
              <p><strong>SAR 21 Light Weight Carbine</strong></p>
              <p>Used by troopers, paramilitary groups, and logistics personnel.</p>
              <p>Shortest and lightest variant.</p>
              <p><strong>SAR 21 M203</strong></p>
              <p>Used by infantry in support firing. M203 grenade launcher attached.</p>
              <p><strong>Ultimax 100 Mark V</strong></p>
              <p>More flexible than standard Ultimax 100. Comes with sight; magazine-fed instead of belt-fed. Used for urban warfare, where controlled fire is vital so as not to hit civilians.</p>
              <p>*SAR 21 costs US$2,000 to US$3,000 ($2,800 to $4,300). Ultimax 100, US$4,000 to US$5,000.</p>

              <p><strong><span style="font-size: 12pt; color: #f75900;">Lianhe Zaobao page 6 - Monday 18 February 2008<br></span><br><br><span style="font-size: 12pt; color: #f75900;">DSTA CE speaks about the challenges of supporting the Third Generation SAF transformation</span></strong></p>
              <p><span><br></span><em>Click </em><a class="jce_file" title="here" href="http://www.dsta.gov.sg/images/stories/DSTA%20Internet/MiscFiles/080218_zb.pdf"><span style="color: #0000ff;"><em>here</em></span></a><em> to view news clipping.<br><br></em></p>
              <p>In his first-ever interview with Lianhe Zaobao yesterday as Defence Science and Technology Agency (DSTA)'s Chief Executive, Mr Soh Kong Pheng said that it is no longer feasible for the Singapore Armed Forces (SAF) to perform a major upgrade of its military capabilities once every fifteen years if it wants to transform its army into a networked fighting force. He added that the new challenges brought about by the Third Generation SAF transformation has led DSTA to adopt a new operational strategy that will enable SAF's military capabilities to be upgraded in a timely and cost-efficient manner.</p>
              <p>"To respond effectively to an ever-changing military landscape, we must be able to upgrade <span style="color: #ff0000;">our capabilities in the shortest time possible.</span> Careful planning of resources and proper management of an equipment's shelf life are important in managing the costs of equipment upgrading. We also need to be aware of the <span style="color: #ff0000;">consequences that each upgrade brings</span>," he said.</p>
              <p>Generally, large-scale miltary equipment such as tanks, fighter jets and battleships that are used by the SAF have an operational shelf life of thirty years. They will undergo a major overhaul to enhance their fighting capabilities after fifteen years in operation. The SM1 lightweight tank, which have been converted from the AMX-13 tanks in 1990, is an example of a major equipment upgrade performed by the SAF.</p>
              <p>Another example is the 2A4 Leopard tanks, which are refurbished by their German manufacturer.</p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">"After receiving the refurbished tanks, we will enhance its capabilities by installing the Battlefield Management System. With further enhancements in the near future, the leopard tanks will integrate effectively with other fighting platforms," </span>he said.</p>
              <p>Mr Soh pointed out that DSTA will establish a long-term relationship with the German equipment manufacturers to pave the way for future equipment upgrades as well as keep abreast of the latest developments in military technologies.</p>
              <p>In a networked fighting force, the various platforms are tightly integrated with one another, which poses a huge challenge to the process of equipment upgrading. Mr Soh stressed that it is important <span style="color: #ff0000;">to plan rigorously before any major system overhaul to minimise any negative impact as well as to control associated costs.</span> DSTA has gained invaluable experience in system integration from its development of <span style="color: #ff0000;">the RSS FORMIDABLE frigate, thus proving that the local defence industry has the capability to support the Third Generation SAF transformation. </span></p>
              <p>"Our next challenge would be to strengthen our capability to integrate various fighting systems. I believe we are prepared to meet this challenge as long as we can retain our engineering talent", he said.</p>
              <p>When asked about defence R&amp;D, Mr Soh said that Singapore must accelerate its pace as defence technologies are evolving rapidly. DSTA will continue to work closely with its foreign partners to nurture cutting-edge technologies.</p>

              <p>Don't think we will change from magazine to belt fed ba... although I forsee a version that can accept the SAR-21 magazine. Belt fed design would probably be for the USMC and other foreign sales. Besides, with the new developmental model for the Army, I don't think we will see as much standardisation of equipment as in the past. For eg, last time the whole SAF was using M16/M4, but now we have the Maneuver arms formations using SAR-21, some of the support arms and logistics Bn using M16/M4, the navy and the air force still largely using M16s.</p>

              <p>Dont worry it's not like we have a shortage of arms to pass around anyway.  As the older NS men ROD they will be replaced by newbies who are trained in SAR21.</p>
              <p>Low priority units rarely get to call their men for SAR21 conversion course anyway. The higher priority ones are converted already by now ba.</p>
              <p>SAR21 conversion for units?  All in good time.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Anyway, i see the new SAW is still M16 mag fed with the M16 like mag catch.  Dont know if the drum mags can fit now....</p>
              <p>Seriously, where's the SAR21 Mag compatible Ultimax.... Either that or ST designers decided to do away with the hassle of making it a reality and switching future SAW gunners to be belt fed 5.56....AKA mini rambo style <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_twisted.gif" alt="icon_twisted.gif"></p>

              <p>Don't think so leh.. changing to belt fed would imply a doctrinal shift in how we use our SAWs... Besides, I don't really think it makes sense--Our SAW gunners would be overloaded with belt fed ammo because they can't get resupp from their section mates anymore. As it is, to resupp you already have to remove the ammo from one mag and put into another mag.</p>
              <p>Unless of course we go the way of the US Army/Marines and make others in the section carry belt fed ammo for the SAW as well, which would be pretty insane because everyone is already heavily loaded.</p>
