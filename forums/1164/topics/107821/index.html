            <div class='col-md body'>I know that Singapore has like 1200 armoured vehicles, but that figure is unpractical. It includes V-200 which we no longer use in Mechanised Infantry role. And 800 should be more realistic combat strength. And I don't think they are only going to produce 400 Bionix. They will replace all 800 vehicles with Bionix. But this will be done over a long time, most likely in one generation.....25 years. 800 is more likely to be true coz each unit has 40 vehicles, that gives 20 Battalions, which is a very realistic figure. There are four Active units, and we serve 2.5 years (only changed (2) recently, so should take the old number). So that means for every 2.5 years there are 4 units. If you take 12.5 years as one life cycle, then there will be 20 units. I one life cycle is 15.5 years and not 12.5, but not all armour units are Mechanised Infantry, so must adjust downwards to be more realistic.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Most sources said that we have abt 720 M113s, and TH said that it has increased to abt 1000 units.Let's assume it is 720 units.<br><br>There are abt 100+ in oversea training grounds so those will not avialable immediately during conflict , and some not just use for AI only , Arty units with 120 SP mortar carriers , armoured pioneer Pl in AEC, some maybe in support unit as ARVs and maybe some in Medical support units as ambulances.<br><br>I have no figure for such units but the number could be as high as 300+ for support units and oversea training.<br><br>So leaving abt 400 M113s , just enough for abt 3 armoured bde.( Ultra?)<br><br>From 90s to now, we have expanded  to RDF 21 Div with armoured element of 22 AMX-10 25ICV and 22 fire support PAC90s.<br>( A bit small , some additional armour I believe is needed here, M113 Arisgator might be good upgrade)<br><br>Then there is the rumoured mechanised div. If this is formed then it will need more IFVs( 360~400 Bionix?), remember the 54 Primus SPH.<br>One such div will need two Bn of Primus i.e. 36 Primus.<br><br>My point is , if indeed going have mechanised div , we do indeed need more IFVs and if Bionix is to replace the M113, then it will be foolish for SAF to upgrade some M113 to Ultra in the first place which is completed just before the introduction of Bionix.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>The SM1 replacement is already ready,so we just have to wait patiently before the MINDEF decides its time to announce the new vehicle(such as in the case of BX and Primus) to the public. As for the M113 Ultras, i don't think they will be totally replaced anytime soon as it have a clear advantage of better river-crossing capability as compared to the BX. People who are trained in the BX should know this. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>With regards to river-crossing. I know that Bx with 24 tons, like the M2 and Warrior, can't really be good. I think that's why they developed the Terrex, but they say it's only for export. SAF not buying any Terrex. We really need something besides the Bionix, as it is obvious that Bionix is like the Western IFVs, and they are all non-river-crossing. The Russians are river-crossing, but only at the expense of lowering armour protection. Any way for real amphibious maybe we should get some LVTP-7.</div>
