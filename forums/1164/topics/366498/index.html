              <p>I have no doubt that the F-35 will be build and delivered to the USAF and USN.  Its capabilites just need some time to develop.  Remember, other planes too some time work out the kinks.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>What I am really doubtful is if we will ever get to order the planes.</p>
              <p>1. Sticker price<br>2. Timeline - can't order the planes before our mod specialist has some playtiem with it?<br>3. Capabilities versus what we have and what we will ever use against.<br>4. The cost of reopening the production line for F-15 and/or F-16</p>

              <p>Its not "will be built". F-35's first batch almost completed for delivery in 2010 and fourth lot already ordered.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>No cost of reopening production line for F-15 and F-16s cos they haven't closed. Not with SK and SG holding up the F-15 production whilst Morocco and Romania being the latest customers of F-16s, Taiwan begging for 60 more F-16s new-builds and F-16INs being a candidate for IAF.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>It is no longer a question of whether F-35 will enter rsaf service but when and how many. SG did not sign a "letter of intent" which cost up to US$50m to participate in the SDD phase if it did not intend to procure the F-35.</p>

              <p>The SDD phase is just look, no touching.  Considering the cost of the aircraft, it is a trivial sum.</p>
              <p>Personally I think the JSF may be ordered much more further into the future than most  observers think.  I would not be so rash to get into 3rd in queue (after UK and Israel) once they start releasing to non US operators.  The other half of the magic of the modern combat aircraft is the avionics. </p>
              <p>As I have stated before we need our modder/s to be familiarised before embarking.</p>

              <p>SG will actually be further back the queue as UK, US, Dutch have already ordered and Turkey, Italy, Canada, Denmark, Norway, Australia already committed whilst Israel is only likely to join.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>SG letter of intent, like Israel's letter of intent is intended to allow SG to purchase low rate production aircraft ie from 2012 onwards.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><a href="http://www.mindef.gov.sg/imindef/news_and_events/nr/2004/mar/16mar04_nr.html">http://www.mindef.gov.sg/imindef/news_and_events/nr/2004/mar/16mar04_nr.html</a></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>"As an SCP, Singapore can also request early purchase of the JSF for delivery from 2012 onwards."</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Otherwise, why pay just to look? LM will more than willingly provide adequate info to other prospective buyers.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>It is an assumption that SG's F-35 will need Israeli modifications. It is likely to do equally well without as everyone else don't want Israeli mods even USAF. And more probably any mods can be retrofit if it is useful.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>As to actual date of rsaf service, wait for official announcement loh.</p>

              the US to seize the initiative in the development of future concepts of
              operations for air-to-air and air-to-ground missions in hostile
              airspace. <br> The fighter is also expected to increase interoperability among allied air forces....<br> <br> <br> Even as a sputtering global economy has led much of the industrialised
              world to shy away from risky financial investments, the US Department
              of Defense (DoD) is charging ahead with its daring USD300 billion plan
              to build the world's first international stealth fighter.<br> <br> The stakes are so high that some aviation analysts refer to the F-35
              Lightning II Joint Strike Fighter as the 'big bet', meaning that while
              the potential rewards may be substantial, the risks are equal or
              greater.<br> <br> The biggest acquisition programme in Pentagon history, the F-35 project
              is expected to result in the delivery of three fighter jet variants - a
              conventional aircraft, a short take-off/vertical landing model and a
              carrier variant - to the US and eight partner nations including
              Australia, Canada, Denmark, Italy, the Netherlands, Norway, Turkey and
              the UK.<br> <br> If the US military and prime contractor Lockheed Martin manage
              production and acquisition effectively, the F-35 could help the US
              military play the lead role in shaping the character of 21st-century
              airpower.<br> <br> The delivery of the multirole stealth fighter to US allies would allow
              the US to seize the initiative in the development of future concepts of
              operations for air-to-air and air-to-ground missions in hostile
              airspace. <br> <br> The fighter is also expected to increase interoperability among allied
              air forces and create new training and maintenance requirements that
              will foster stronger military-to-military and industry ties. Finally,
              F-35 production techniques hold the promise of revolutionising stealth
              aircraft manufacturing.</span></blockquote>

              <p>No use arguing whether the F-35 is a reality or mirage.  The issue about the F-35 is simply that there is no other alternative left.  It is the ONLY multirole 5th Gen coming up for THREE services of the US military.  </p>

              <p>If the JSF is a reality or mariage is something lionnoisy is not really concerned about, he's more concerned with using each and every situtation can use it to claim national superiority in some childish way.</p>
              <p>The fact that Singapore has also invested in the JSF In february 2003, where it joined the <strong><em>JSF</em></strong> program's System Design and Development (SDD) Phase, as a Security Co-operation Participant (SCP) seems to be lost on him.</p>
              <p>So how on earth he can be happy if the JSF is not doing well given it would reflect badly on us when we have a stake in it as well, is something that only we can guess about, but my guess is quite simply he was so intent on finding stuff to bash other nations he ended up shooting himself in the foot.</p>

              <p><br>In the characteristic style of the noisy pussy - the noise will precede the arrival of the pussy.</p>
              <p>Can we trust your ability to be honest with your details ?</p>
              <p>Will you place your bet on these two characters and question the collective wisdom of all the leadership at different levels and from different countries that have committed themselves to the JSF program ?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Can we count on the unbias views towards the JSF, when background check reveals that <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/05/15/AR2006051501518.html">‘Pierre M Sprey became heavily involved in the design of two key Air Force warplanes -- the F-16 fighter and the A-10 ground attack jet. ’ (*1) </a>?</p>
              <p><a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.flightglobal.com/blogs/the-dewline/2008/11/pierre-spreys-ideal-us-airpowe.html">Does the noisy pussy know what Pierre Sprey’s ideal US air power fleet consist of ? (*2) </a></p>
              <p>Will you believe that his ideal fleet for the 21st Century and beyond remains with airframes that date back twenty years ago ?</p>
              <p>At his present age indulging in reminiscing the romance of the F-16 and A-10 that were his babies, we can trust the brilliance of the noisy pussy to depend on one who makes as loud a noise to impress your pussy.</p>

              <p><a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.cdi.org/staff/staffinfo.cfm?StaffID=81">Who is Winslow T Wheeler ? (*3) </a></p>
              <p><a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.cdi.org/staff/staffinfo.cfm?StaffID=81">In 2002, Wheeler authored an essay, under the pseudonym "Spartacus," about Congress' reaction to the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorists attacks ("Mr. Smith Is Dead: No One Stands in the Way as Congress Lards Post-September 11 Defense Bills with Pork"). When Senators complained about Wheeler's criticisms, he was invited to resign from his position with the Republican staff of the Senate Budget Committee. He is now a senior fellow and director of the Straus Military Reform Project at the Center for Defense Information. (*4) </a></p>
              <p>With the Senate and Congress jointly dismissing Winslow T Wheeler for his indiscretion in abusing the privilege of his relationship with members of the Senate and Congress - can his views and opinions be relied on ?</p>
              <p>Can a person with pet peeve be objective in any views towards those who have crossed him before ?</p>
              <p>Only a noisy pussy will be drawn to characters with similar dubious agenda, and tainted by their preferred pet political prejudice - can we trust your pussy for making all the noise that clearly focus on your inability to be circumspect on any issues ?</p>
