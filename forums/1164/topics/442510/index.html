              <p>Hey all,</p>
              <p>Need ur expert advice here haha. I ll keep it a simple read:</p>
              <p><strong>About me</strong></p>
              <p>I defered from NS in April 2011 to go back and retake my A levels. My new enlistment date is 16th Jan 2012. I have been posted to SCS &amp; SWAS. I am currently PES A</p>
              <p><strong>What I need</strong></p>
              <p>Get posted to a vocation/unit that can stay out</p>
              <p><strong>Why I need to stay out</strong></p>
              <p>Before going BMT, I had sensitive nose. When I wake up every morning, the first thing I would do is to sneeze repeatedly and uncontrollably and then my nose would start running. I have been to doctors and they told me that my case cannot be cured but can be controlled. Over the years, I realized that to control my condition I need to sleep in a well air-conditioned room because if my body temperature is too low in the morning, my condition will get worse. After sleeping in the air-conditionless bunks in BMTC and field camps, my condition worsened. Not only does my nose run every morning, the entire area around my nose and eyes feel pressurized and bloated. I couldn't even do 5BX properly because the watery mucous will start dripping all over the place (sry for being gross and I am not exaggerating). I feel like crap for the whole day because of the pressure in my nose and eyes area and the nose that would just not stop running.</p>
              <p>Ever since I defered from NS to study, my condition has slowly gotten better though it is still worse than before BMT. I need to stay out so that I can sleep in the air-conditioned room at home and stop my conditioning from worsening again. I really can't imagine life with this crap feeling everyday.</p>
              <p><strong>My questions</strong></p>
              <p>1. Do I need to down PES to get a stayout vocation/unit?</p>
              <p>2. Is my condition down-PES-able?</p>
              <p>3. Exactly what I should do (who to contact, what to prepare, where i should go, etc) if I were to down PES?</p>
              <p>4. What if by the time I re-enlist the MO still havent down PES me? Can I excused stay-in if I am still pending down PES at that time?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Please lend me ur advice! Details will be greatly appreciated!</p>

                                      unit camp medical centre. Give the MO whatever supporting
                                      documents you have in hand. E.g. <em><strong>Specialist memo/report

              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>7)</strong> MO will decide whether you are deemed
                                      eligible for KIV downgrade, according to the criterias set in
                                      the "PES Bible" directive. <em>E.g. Diagnosis, Extent of

                                      Diagnosis/Injury/Illness/Disease...etc.</em></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>8)</strong> If deemed so, you will sign an

                                      case statement is prepared for review
                                      discussion at the monthly medical board meet (usually at
                                      the Formation/Division HQ) with another NSF CPT MO and
                                      the Chairman (SAF Regular Medical Doctor of MAJOR
                                      rank or above). Your Medical Board result will be post mailed

              <p>Thanks for all the replies so far.</p>
              <p>I think my problem is not just sensitive to "dusty areas". Rather, if i do not sleep in an air conditioned room with the right temperature I will wake up having the symptoms, and if the environment persist to be like that for a few days my condition will worsen.</p>
              <p>My condition got a little better after POP when I got to sleep at home. Upon receiving the notification that I am going to be post to SCS &amp; SWAS, I tried to sleep without air condition for a few days so that I can "test" my ability to sleep in camp bunk condition. Unfortunately my symptoms came back and became quite bad.</p>
              <p>So I am wondering whether the MO will consider this and allow me to be excused stay-in.</p>
