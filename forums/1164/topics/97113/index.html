            <div class='col-md body'>Wow, you can probably write a Ph.D thesis, even a column of books, speculating what the invasion will be like.<br><br>My small input:-<br><br>- IMO Taiwan has the missiles &amp; airplanes to stonewall China's 1st wave of ships, regardless of the latter's own missiles pointing at the island.<br><br>- China has practiced simulation attacks from both Zhejiang &amp; Guangdong provinces. I personally don't think it'll hit Taiwan's north, where Taipei is &amp; thus most likely fortified. The tip of its south is more logical, but then it's common sense to expect Taiwan to beef up that area. It'll be pretty bold for the Chinese to sail around the island &amp; attack its eastern shorelines.<br><br>- China is curiously practicing D-Day type landings, which will be a bloodbath if it's the real thing. I dunno their message here is more about saber-rattling, or if their generals are still so Napoleonic-heroic. Remember, they emphasize propaganda a lot &amp; also made sacrifical charges against the Japs (&amp; America in the Korean War).</div>

First declare a period of time allowing taiwanese not wanting to get involved to go to china, housing, food provided. Whether the taiwanese come to china or not but I am certain many will flee Taiwan. China may not be able to cordon off Taiwan but declare the sea and air around taiwan as war zone, ships and planes come to taiwan at its own risks. Put  a few hundreds missiles on standby.  Fire one or two missiles a day, beginning with the old outdated ones, like the silkworm missiles. May be take out the warhead.<br><br>How long with Taiwan last?<br><br>America can send 7 aircraft carriers groups but see how long will they last?<br><br>Taiwan will then have to attack China, no choice, but US will have to think very carefully if their planes can fly and bomb China! that is a different ball game oredi.<br><br>Both sides will lose, but China can afford to lose more; Both sides will suffer, but Taiwan will suffer more.<br><br>Taiwan is going on a very dangerous route!<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I think China may start with decapitation strikes(SpecOps?missile strikes ala the American against Saddam?) aimed at th Taiwanese command structure,possibly at Chen Shui Bian himself.At the vey least,it would place on him not just the need to be in touch with his commanders and be in the loop of things,but also the need to stay alive.It may even shake him enough to deny him the capacity to take charge of the situation.At the same time, large-scale and well-coordinated strikes on ROC's C4I facilities and airfields(like wat zenden had said)as well as SEAD strikes may carried out by the PRC to cripple the ROC's C4I efforts as well as impair the ROC's air force.That said,the ROC is not going to roll over and die.It will particularly try to deny the PRC the opportunity to carry out the aforementioned strikes;certainly its long-range surveillance radars(such as the one at the air defense control and reporting centre at Leshan) would spot the PRC strike packages and vector the ROC's numerous air-defence fighters onto them.While the ROC air force is no slouch,we have to bear in mind that the PLAAF have both quantity and quality now.Its older planes like the J-6s,J-7s,J-8s,led by J-10s, could trouble the ROCAF for long enuf for the Su-27s &amp; Su-30s to carry out the strikes.Also,we have to bear in mind that the ROC's F-16 Block 20 aren't exactly top-of-the-line stuff anymore.After that,the PLAN would certainly sortie its surface combatants and submarines to stake out the Taiwan Straits in order to facilitate the next phase,which is the amphibious landings of troops.There may be problem in this as the PLAN is not supposed to have enuf assets to sealift sufficient troops in one sortie.However,the pro-unification elements in the ROC may have oreadi taken over and sued for peace.<br></div>
