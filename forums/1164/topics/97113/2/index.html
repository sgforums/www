In fact China is already the 4th hottest destination for emigrating Taiwanese. Currently there are estimated to be around 4 million Taiwanese living in the mainland.

            <div class='col-md body'>As everyone knows, China military has admitted that at the moment it is weak in its naval abilities, so launching a 1st wave of attack from sea is not logical.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_confused.gif" alt="Confused" title="Confused"><br>Its likely that the 1st wave of attacks will be by China's airforce, it artilleries &amp; its missile bats.  Damage will be significant to Taiwan in just 1 day of bombings.<br>2nd wave from China would come in the form of China's airborne troops &amp; Spec Ops.  Believe me when I said that these China's Spec Ops guys are all pumped to take on Taiwan.<br>3rd wave would then be China's navy &amp; its MARINEs.<br><br>Taiwan on its part, is likely to launch a pre-empt strike if they know war with China is inevitable.  Likely to use its limited airforce &amp; missile abilities for stratagic suicide strikes on China, follow by deploying its airborne &amp; Spec Ops to fight on China's soil.  Taiwan's Navy is likely to be its defensives line against the weaker China's Navy.<br><br>Irregardless of what anyone might assumed China's aging Generals might be, they are not likely to suggest the use of nuke on Taiwan or any other country except against the U.S.  Reason for this is the knowledge of the nuclear fall-out that follows a nuke strike.  Till date, no 1 is  able to control the weather movements to allow for a reasonable safety nuke strike.  Also, using a nuke on Taiwan would make it pointless to occupy a useless piece of land.</div>
