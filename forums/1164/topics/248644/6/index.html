But When I was doing GCC just a few years back, we are already introduced to the drum mag. When Live firing, SAW ppls also use drum mag, only during ATP then they use the normal 30rds mag.

But then again, u might be out of your depth at serious forums where serious analysts and military types are at (like www.defencetalk.com etc.).<br><br>-----------------<br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by moca:</div><div class="quote_body">Belt-feeding is slower to reload? How much slower? Does it take more than 1 minute to switch between belts that come contained in canvas pouches or plastic boxes?<br><br>And switching between bulky U100 drums is what? lightning speed?<br><br></div></blockquote>Have u even changed a STANAG mag b4? Else would u even need to ask this?<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by moca:</div><div class="quote_body">However, you seem to be very authoritative when you insisted that the drums were not issued because they need to be factory-loaded and that's costly.<br><br></div></blockquote>Go research the price of the drum magazines, C-Mag prices are all over, surely u can do that urself, its a good guide.<br><br>U dun know how army logistics work?<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by moca:</div><div class="quote_body">If this is true then how come 7.62 belts - which also need to be factory loaded - were issued with every excercise, live or blanks? Can it be that belts are cheaper for the factory to load than the drums? </div></blockquote>Precisely why I dun get the point of your postÂ…are you pointing out the obvious or answering your own rant?<br><br>IsnÂ’t it obvious that belts are disposable? ThatÂ’s why they are called disintegrating belts?!<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by moca:</div><div class="quote_body">Furthermore, from what I read, the drum need only be reloaded by an armourer with a simple reloading tool - and not some giant expensive robotic contraption. Or perhaps you mean transporting the empty mags back to base is too costly for the mighty SAF?<br></div></blockquote>So u think that every SAW gunner should be equipped with an additional tool to hand load the drums? Try inventing one convenient to use, small &amp; light enough. Or do you think that SAF doctrine says that soldiers should have nothing better to do except hand loading 100 rd drums by hand. So soldiers should hand link belt ammo by hand too?<br><br>So u feel the SAF logistics has nothing better to do? Or r u not experienced enough to know the various ways SAF saves money? The reputation of the SAF as a reference customer is also the same reason why it is so careful with money. ThatÂ’s why the old timers can tell u about SAR 80s in reserve/logistic/crap units, beat up M16s/U100s in training schools like BMT/SISPEC, similarly the way plastic blanks are still being used. But u dun tell ur lau peh how to save money to meet the budget.<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by moca:</div><div class="quote_body">Next question is the reliablility of the drums. You go on and on about how terrible the M249 is. Yet we are more interested in how reliable the U100 drum is, never mind the M249.<br></div></blockquote>Again read first b4 u cut &amp; paste. If what I posted was too long, then just ignore. But dun screw around with the wrong context and then put words in others mouths.<br><br>Terrible? It was a comparison of the latest feedback from Iraq. Go figure<br><br>Many posters have already said eough, I do not need to tell u the conditions &amp; how the U100 drum operates.<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by moca:</div><div class="quote_body">How many U100 drums do you fire everyday?<br><br>Dude, I have never even seen a U100 drum in SAF apart from open house or some pictures of sales demo to foreigners. None of my SAW gunners have ever fired their weapons from a drum. Of course, maybe this is because we are from some crap infantry unit so maybe you have an entirely different experience. So please share.<br></div></blockquote>Perhaps ur infantry unit is crap, so much for your self-esteem, but more likely, uÂ’re too young. &amp; I would not know nor care about what the recent troopers boys do or get to play with.<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by moca:</div><div class="quote_body">The next question is about what will happen to the U100 post M16?<br><br>So, in your opinion, what will happen, do we maintain the stauts quo, do we change the U100 to take SAR-21 mags? This also imply a change of the U100 drum. </div></blockquote>IÂ’ve expressed enough of my views on this. READ then post. Else dun bother.<br><br>I dun sell crystal balls, else IÂ’d been doing online stock trading now or creating the new magazine to sell to everybody.<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by moca:</div><div class="quote_body">I think everyone, including Dave, love the Ultimax. None is in any doubt that the U100 outshot and out performed the M249 in accuracy. Given a chance, I, and many others, will take the U100 over a M249 beast. So no need to "re-invent the wheel" and preach to the converted.<br><br>Understand that: Nobody here wants the M249. </div></blockquote>I don't bother to preach to strangers who have no relevance to me. Try following that long thread (not just my post) b4 sounding off Â… it was in reply to ppl bleating on about belt-feeds and 200 rounds being better.<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by moca:</div><div class="quote_body">Me neither... but nobody is asking you to. The M249 is NOT the only belt-feeding gun in the world. That's the wrong tree you are barking up. </div></blockquote>First get the context right. When did anybody say its the only belt-feeding gun? Not dyslexic r u?<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by moca:</div><div class="quote_body">The last question is the reliability of belts:<br><br>You claim that belt-feeding is terrible. Is belt-feeding terrible for reliablility in general, or is it that certain belt-feeding guns are unrealiable?<br><br>I know, for a fact, that belt feeding can be VERY RELIABLE. The 50-year old FN MAG, the 80-year old Browning M2 are all living proof. Not to mention the scores of WW1 and WW2 belt-fed guns of all sides. </div></blockquote>Get it right, all belt-feeds have the same problems since time immemorial. So WWII belt-fed machine guns never jammed? Try correlating that with the latest feedback from the Iraq experience with the so-called Â“bestÂ” belt-feed SAW in the world (if according to DaveC &amp; the numbers in service alone).<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by moca:</div><div class="quote_body">On the other hand, many drum fed weapons suffered from reliablity problems including the Thompson. Which is why the US stopped issuing Thompson drums during WW2. The Bren also had a 100-rd drum mag for air-defense role which was also not generally issued due to reliability problems.<br><br>I am merely asking if belt-feed might be an option for the U100 IF the drums are indeed unreliable. </div></blockquote>Why on earth would u do that &amp; defeat the whole purpose of the U100 in the 1st place? IÂ’ve spelt out the well-known facts about belt-feeding issues why didnÂ’t u peruse them? Oh yeah right, u probably didnÂ’t read them. Figures.<br><br>IÂ’ve listed plenty of reasons why drums are not widely issued. Its not just reliability. Its cost too. Ur examples of the Thompson &amp; Bren are ridiculous. The former is not even a SAW or MG to warrant the cost, logistics resupply issues etc. The latter is a top loading gun, what the hell can u see once u fit a drum on top? Revisit what I mentioned b4 in the other thread.<br><br>The rest have said enough about the U100 drum's reliability. Drum design has improved &amp; the U100Â’s reflects that. What you just have to note is this, the strength of a drumÂ’s spring directly correlates with its reliability. This needs to be balanced against the weight penalty since the stiffer the spring the heavier the spring and casing assembly. Its about finding the right balance, dependent also on the usual factors like ammo quality, wear &amp; tear on the U100 itself. But note that it is stiff enough to enable long-term storage fully loaded without suffering spring fatigue.<br><br>The older troopers like me know its certainly good enough &amp; gives the lie to all that crap about jammomatics Â– that applies to blanks only. Or do u not know why it happens with blanks too?<br><br>IÂ’m sure u will have replies &amp; more questions, but dun expect any speedy response if at all. IÂ’m done with long posts.<br></div>
