            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by Daniel-Lim:</div><div class="quote_body">Making the SAR-21 take only proprietary plastic mags is a mistake to begin with. If current STANAG mags are bad, I'm sure a better one can be made, including adding the see-thru option. If STK put their mind to it, I don't see why this can't be done. Diemaco of Canada has already made a more reliable STANAG mag. The British also use their own more robust STANAG mags for their SA80 rifles.</div></blockquote>Ney, last I checked this hasn't stopped plenty of other designs from coming up with their own proprietary mags as solutions to the issue of the shortcomings of the STANAG.<br><br>At the end of the day you can only improve the STANAG mag that much- you certainly can't make it out of polymer and attempts to make it of more robust material cause weight gains and are at best a stopgap to the issues of that magazine system. The improved metal mags will still dent under sufficent abuse and wear and what have you not.<br><br>The truth of the matter is, this who magazine system is in bad need of a overhaul to a new polymer standard, but until that is done we are stuck with a metal mag that can often prove to be the weak link in what are otherwise excellent firearms.<br><br>AFAIK, the SAR can easily be made to accept STANAGs, as the export versions have long shown... but for some reason the SAF didn't want it in the version they used.<br><br>That said, I'll take a SAR polymer mag over any metal magazine system anytime. The weight-reliability ratio just works, it is my opinion we should be working towards converting all our 5.56mm firearms to run on the polymer magazine system then having to stick our firearms with the STANAG system.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I have to disagree with the accurate , SNiper U100! U100 is accurate for its purpose and design! but it is defeintly not more accurate than an M16... like UZI will never be more accurate than an MP5!<br><br>Accuracy in a rifle ,usually takes a lot to make it accurate ! MEia would probably agree with me on this.<br><br>And a Semi auto ,, will be even more difficult ! we have a lot of factor to make an accurate rifle, rigidity of barrel, action lockup, action type ... trigger actions , barrel type , free floating, tolerance and precision of the parts.not to mention ammunition... etc... and reemeber consistantcy is accuracy and all these have to be consistant!<br><br>Reason why I say it is harder to accurized a U100.. an open bolt system having the bolt slamming onto and firing it do not have ample lockup like a close bolt system... and you cannot fine tune the lockup such that after firing, the bolt will not open in the precise time to give mazimum pressure so the bullet and leave the barrel.... and with that in mind... the U100 is a bad candidate !  next thing is the gas system!  having regulating type will take out the very consistancy of airflow and all that! thus the accuracy will not be as good.<br><br>it just like it takes a lot to accurazied say a Fn/FAL or L1A1 becasue of the gas system and the piston plus the lockup of the FAL!  L1A1 uses variable gas system which is not precise enough to give consistant gas flow each time the rifle is fired! thus accuracy suffer ! not saying the FAL will not shoot... the FAL will consistantly do 2 MOA  but makeing it 1moa or less like an accuraize AR would be difficult.. not impossible but a lot has to be done! Same thing with say an AK, Valmet or the Galil.... I can shoot maybe 2 MOA on the untune Galil ARM that I have ,,, but my AR15 will shoot 1 MOA or less consistantly... AK action's lockup, tolerance is not as good as the M16.. thus it is more difficult to get an accurized AK...<br><br>there are newer rifle out there like the G36, Tavor, SAR21 ... we have to examine each system to see how much accuracy the system can do! you will be surprise that a lot of the older system actually gives better accuracy!<br><br>U can take the U100 and use it as Sniper rifle! just like some people using FAL as a sniper rifle! but it will be using the wrong rifle for the wrong job where it is not design for...<br><br>We have come a long way and a lot has change in the sniper rifles and accurazation is concern! ....<br><br></div>

I thought our SAR21 would have surpassed it in terms of accuracy already, not to mention all the new rifles popping up</div></blockquote>He's not kidding you, not to what I know anyway.<br><br>In the hands of a pro who knows how to shoot his stuff, the M16 is one of the most precise firearms ever, thanks to it's direct impingement system which simply has far less parts moving and shifting weight as you would get in a piston.<br><br>However this is also it's downside, for it makes it quite a bit less reliable then other kinds of actions.<br><br>In terms of overall performance for the grunt, the SAR21 is more accurate because of its 1.5x scope and egronomics. The disadvantage you get in using a piston system is more then made out for by removing the need to figure out the ghost sight picture that some of our guys simply cannot figure out. And of course this is subjective but I prefered the balance of the SAR to the M-16... I guess I like the weight of my weapon centralized.<br><br>Of course, this is not even assuming that you can stick a scope on the M-16.<br><br>In terms of MOA and group size in the hands of two equally skilled pros who know their stuff, you will probably get a better group with the '16 then the SAR. But of course this is raw, <strong>technical</strong> accuracy.<br><br>However if you take everything into account, including the increased number of conscripts who can finally hit something with the SAR (thanks to the scope), as well as the ability to fire the SAR one handed and in strange positions that you might encounter in FIBUA with improved accuracy (thanks to it's centralized weight distribution), the SAR-21 presents an overall increase in <strong>combat</strong> accuracy for the grunt.<br><br>Those two things are quite different, for example (though this is an extreme one), the rifles they use in sharpshooting contests are probably a lot more accurate then your military weapons, but you probably aren't going to chiong with those weapons or realize that that increase in accuracy really helps you out in your combat drills. You'll probably get more hits if you stuck with the military weapon.<br><br>That said, different guns for different needs.<br><br>But of course, the differences in technical MOA accuracy we are talking here (M-16 vs. SAR)  are really marginal for all pratical purposes. You can still easily nail a first shot hit on a target at 300 meters with the SAR, and that's more or less more then what the average grunt needs. But factor everything in and the SAR is an easier and more forgiving gun to shoot in combat.<br><br>This is certainly no AK47 vs M-16 difference in accuracy we are talking here.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I don't know who actually tried to make the U100 a sniper rifle when there are so many better options out there. Most AR will outshoot the U in semi. It's probably one of those things you try after a few beers too many.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br><br>When you squeeze trigger on the U100 the first thing to happen is the heavy bolt carrier sliding forward. This will throw your aim off slightly. So if you are talking about pin point accuracy like that of the M16, you won't get it with the U.<br><br>The U100's reputation is being the most accurate LMG, due mainly to its constant recoil system that reduces recoil to negligible levels during Full Auto fire.<br></div>
