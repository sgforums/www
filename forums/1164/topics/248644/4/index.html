It is reliable &amp; certainly safe. The Croatians loved it during the Serbian war. There are no confirmed reports otherwise in all the 20 years.<br><br>The reason the U100 drum magazine is not widely used in the SG army is the difficulty with hand loading to the max (100 rounds) cost due to the strength of the spring. That &amp; the cost.<br><br>For training purposes, the need to reload regularly and the cost of sending it back for machine reloading makes it costly for peacetime use. Believe me, they have stockpiles of it ... when it comes to war time ... it'll be issued pronto.<br><br>Its the same case with all large capacity magazines since time immemorial. The Thompson sub-machinegun during WWII was the same. The mobsters (clean urban setting, dodgy money, macho scare factor) used the drum but ironically not the troops during WWII. Even then its not even anywhere near 100 rounds.<br><br>The cost is also an issue with all modern "large" capacity magazines. Look at the price of the P90 mag.<br><br>Some misconceptions I noted:<br><br>1) C-Mags<br>They are not the answer. If only because they need graphite lubricants in order to hand load!<br><br>Its tough enough to expect soldiers to clean/oil their rifles during combat. To expect them to lubricate their magazine is ridiculous to me. I'd rather be maintaining the rifle.<br><br>Incidentally, the American designer commissioned by Singapore to invent the beloved Ultimax 100 is also the inventor of the C-Mag. The original version was all black, nylon plastic. No lubrication needed. But the current C-mag makers put in a clear Lexan back to enable viewing of the remaining rounds. Penalty - the lubricant. If u dun use it, it'll jam too.<br><br>Of course, the cost of each mag again. The U100 drum is simpler.<br><br>2) Belt-feeding<br>I dun know why so many ppl yearn for belt-feeding. Be careful about the devil you ask for.<br><br>Read the US troops current top complaints. The M249 is one of them. The Iraq experience has shown that its slower to reload, mechanism is more complex &amp; prone to reliability problems especially when encountering sand/mud, cleaning/oiling/maintenance is a pain as a result, the gun needs to divert more gas to provide the energy to "pull" the belt through the system, which means that theoretically, given the same barrel length, less propellant goes towards pushing the projectile = less projectile energy/accuracy/range etc., the ammo on a per round basis is heavier &amp; more costly due to the metal links.<br><br>I guess the grass is always greener on the other side. If you use the 100 rd drum everyday, you will not be even wishing for belt ammo.<br><br>That forms the basis why the USMC is evaluating the LMG concept for which the U100 is the only EXISTING product that fits ALL its requirements without modification.<br><br>As to the perceived disadvantages, they are a non-issue:<br><br>1) Why do you need 200 rounds, when you know that the U100 is the most accurate LMG/SAW in the world? Our boys representing the SG army in the Aussie combat skills competitions ALWAYS top score against all the US/Aussie/NZ/Brit or whatever countries taking part - all using the FN M249.<br><br>The whole point is to concentrate the bursts into tight groupings. Make every round count. Use short accurate bursts. The U100 outhits the M249 ALL THE TIME.<br><br>Only Hollywood likes unlimited rounds. Real soldiers have to bloody lug them around.<br><br>The U100 means less weight penalty not only gun wise but ammo wise. The strain on the logistics chain is more manageable too.<br><br>2) The U100 weighs 10lbs as opposed to the 15 lbs of the M249.<br><br>I DON'T EVER WANT US TO BE USING THE M249. If u've ever done your road marches or jungle exercises, u'd be crazy to want to struggle with a weapon 50% heavier or with 200 round ammo boxes or worse... noisy clinky ammo belts!<br><br>Same barrel length &amp; overall gun length. But the U100 is infinitely more usable with a folding stock too.<br><br>3) The U100 can use the 30 rd mags wheras the M249 needs another complex /costly/heavy adapter.<br><br>4) Speed of loading / self-sufficiency.<br><br>Besides the oft mentioned doctrines of the SAW gunner as integral to the assault maneuvers, the SG army is quite unique with its 7 man squad. Population constraint, what to do? Yet still must maximise firepower right?<br><br>The SAW gunner has to be self-sufficient and able to reload as quickly as any other soldier using the 30 rd mag.<br><br>With the M249, you'd need another soldier for support, if not for quicker loading, then to carry the bloody ammo! Which the gunner tends to waste because he is far less accurate and tends to squeeze off using longer bursts!<br><br>See the vicious cycle?<br><br>5) Ability to handload - moot point<br>For goodness sakes, how the hell do you intend to hand link individual bullets from M16/M4s into belt form while in the field? Using glue? Sewing kit?<br><br>What has been bandied about is the issue of small mechanical loaders to "lever" the ammo reload in the field though, that could be the answer.</div></blockquote>I just re-posted this from the SAR-21 thread.</div>

Respect the weapon and it will protect you, disregard it and it will be the master over you.<br><br>Hmm..nt really familiar with the Ultimax 100 weapon, but have been able to fire it 2/3 times and handle it during open house etc. Just my 2 cents, I was wondering...the U100 SAW is fundamentally designed to provide high volume of sustained fire and yet be a weapon that allows the user to progress at the rate his section proceeds at. Yes? Prolonged firing of any weapon will cause heat build up and rapid wearing out of the weapon right?Thus is there a possibility that our SAW gunners are issued with 30 round mags as part of a training doctrine, to ensure that they make their bursts last and count as each time they load, they only have 30 rounds to play with. So when the magic button is pushed, SAW gunners are issued with the 100 drum mags. They will be conditioned to fire the weapon in bursts as they trained with the 30 round box mags,due to muscle memory perhaps?<br><br>But on the flip side, I do not agree with this as the gunners may not be trained with the 100 round drum, resulting in operation issues etc. Besides, perhaps can someone answer this, if using a 100 round drum mag, if an IA is encountered, is it easy to clear? Lastly...an ideal SAW weapon, haha...I did say I would wish to lay my hands on something similiar to the H&amp;K 416, but of course, belt-fed for me with the option of using STANMAGs.</div>

Not to slight the M249 but its easy to see why it was considered a major improvement over its predecessor - as a SAW.<br><br>etc etc etc</div></blockquote>I think everyone, including Dave, love the Ultimax. None is in any doubt that the U100 outshot and out performed the M249 in accuracy. Given a chance, I, and many others, will take the U100 over a M249 beast. So no need to "re-invent the wheel" and preach to the converted.<br><br><strong><span style="color: red;">Understand that: Nobody here wants the M249.</span></strong><br><br>We are asking some questions and they are:<br><br>Â• why the drum was never issued?<br><br>Â• is the drum reliable?<br><br>Â• what will happen to U100 post SAR-21?<br><br>Â• is belt-feeding a good alternative for the next U100 version?<br><br>I am a layman, and all my points are my own and not based on some inside knowledge. However, you seem to be very authoritative when you insisted that the drums were not issued because they need to be factory-loaded and that's costly.<br><br>YET...<br><br>If this is true then how come 7.62 belts - which also need to be factory loaded - were issued with every excercise, live or blanks? Can it be that belts are cheaper for the factory to load than the drums?<br><br>Furthermore, from what I read, the drum need only be reloaded by an armourer with a simple reloading tool - and not some giant expensive robotic contraption. Or perhaps you mean transporting the empty mags back to base is too costly for the mighty SAF?<br><br>Next question is the reliablility of the drums. You go on and on about how terrible the M249 is. Yet we are more interested in how reliable the U100 drum is, never mind the M249.<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by Let:</div><div class="quote_body">If you use the 100 rd drum everyday, you will not be even wishing for belt ammo. </div></blockquote>How many U100 drums do you fire everyday?<br><br>Dude, I have never even seen a U100 drum in SAF apart from open house or some pictures of sales demo to foreigners. None of my SAW gunners have ever fired their weapons from a drum. Of course, maybe this is because we are from some crap infantry unit so maybe you have an entirely different experience. So please share.<br><br>The next question is about what will happen to the U100 post M16?<br><br>So, in your opinion, what will happen, do we maintain the stauts quo, do we change the U100 to take SAR-21 mags? This also imply a change of the U100 drum.<br><br>Or what?<br><br>The last question is the reliability of belts:<br><br>You claim that belt-feeding is terrible. Is belt-feeding terrible for reliablility in general, or is it that certain belt-feeding guns are unrealiable?<br><br>I know, for a fact, that belt feeding can be VERY RELIABLE. The 50-year old FN MAG, the 80-year old Browning M2 are all living proof. Not to mention the scores of WW1 and WW2 belt-fed guns of all sides.<br><br>On the other hand, many drum fed weapons suffered from reliablity problems including the Thompson. Which is why the US stopped issuing Thompson drums during WW2. The Bren also had a 100-rd drum mag for air-defense role which was also not generally issued due to reliability problems.<br><br>I am merely asking if belt-feed might be an option for the U100 IF the drums are indeed unreliable.<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by Let:</div><div class="quote_body">I DON'T EVER WANT US TO BE USING THE M249.</div></blockquote>Me neither... but nobody is asking you to. The M249 is NOT the only belt-feeding gun in the world. That's the wrong tree you are barking up.<br><br>Belt-feeding is slower to reload? How much slower? Does it take more than 1 minute to switch between belts that come contained in canvas pouches or plastic boxes?<br><br>And switching between bulky U100 drums is what? lightning speed?<br><br>With 100 rounds of either drum or belts, you shouldn't be reloading all that often, anyway. And most people without a death wish will duck behind cover to reload even a pistol.<br><br>And is the SAW gunner being out of action for 1 minute to reload a a dire consequence. Maybe, but the SAW is NOT the only weapon in a section.</div>

I don't know how many of you have noticed it, but we sometimes have 2 SAW gunners in each section. This means that whether they used 30rds or 100rds magazines, the firepower is already double that of most other armies with only one SAW per section.</div>
