            <div class='col-md body'>Yeah, the Ultimax is light, low recoil, accurate and cheap. Most of us who have used it loved it.<br><br>But IMO there is bound to be changes coming. I can't see how this situation with the magazine difference can persist. I'm surprised the M-16/M203 system is still in use. You would think that fitting a grenade launcher to the SAR-21 will be a picnic but there must be some reasons why this hasn't happened yet.<br><br>But a change to make the Ultimax take SAR-21 mags will be major. There is no way, I think, they can make modifications to make current Ultimax to take SAR-21 mags. They would have to majorly rebuild them or build new versions from scratch.<br><br>Would STK build a new version of the Ultimax jst to take SAR-21 mags?<br><br>Hard to say.<br><br>The Ultimax, vaunted as it is by many, has so far not seen a major sale.<br><br>Though SAF is the priority but I think STK is also constantly on the lookout for a weapon system that will make it a global name. So far it has been always close but no cigar.<br><br>So it is possible that STK may try and come up with a new SAW. I won't even be surprised that they will bend to global trends and make a belt-feed gun.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>The problem with our SAW is that it's a 30rd mag. However, it's exactly it's 30 rd mag that makes it compact and light.<br><br>Best is hope it doesnt get replaced.<br><br>Other countries use belt fed weapons as a SAW. M249 ,rpk74 and fn mini.  they are all ,in my opnion, not suitable.  Clinking + 50 rd belt swinging ?  no thanks.<br><br>They are beltfed cause mags larger than 30 rds starts to have problems - loading and reliability. Not to mention weight. Imagine you hang a 2+kg dumbbell on your m16...<br><br>For emplacements, you are talking about a GPMG. MGs are able to have longer and sustained fire, comes with changable barrels.<br><br>The only thing we are worried is the SAW will be taken away because SAR21 = end of m16 mags.  Hopefully it wont happen.<br><br>For those who ask why is there a need for SAW - it's auto, it's accurate and it keeps enemies heads down. You cant do that with m16/sar21 at a section level.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I agree but to play devil's advocate belt fed SAWs have neat canvas pouches or plastic boxes for the belts. As you can see from these examples of the M249 and IMI Negev, the mag/pouch is no more cumbersome than the Ultimax drums. In fact, after firing off the belt, you need only carry the empty canvas pouch or the plastic baox, which must be lighter than an empty Ultimax drum. In the case of the pouch, even more compact.<br><img src="http://www.airsplat.com/images/m2491%5B1%5D.jpg"><br><img src="http://www.militarypictures.info/d/219-2/M249SAW.jpg"><br><img src="http://www.haborumuveszete.hu/rovatok/fegyverek/lo/negev/negev_s.jpg"><br><img src="http://www.haborumuveszete.hu/rovatok/fegyverek/lo/negev/negev_1.jpg"><br><img src="http://world.guns.ru/machine/ultimax_1.jpg"><br><img src="http://www.defensereview.com/stories/ultimax/Ultimax_11.jpg"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>There are so many different specifications for a SAW that difers from army to army.<br><br>I don't know exactly how they are organized but....<br><br>The US have within the section M249, designated as a SAW, and M-16 &amp; M-203.<br><br>The British seems to be undecided. They have the Minimi (M249) AND the L86 LSW, basically a souped up version of their L85 Assault Rifle. The L86 has a heavier (longer?) barrel and uses the STANAG mags. Though the L86 LSW is now kinda become the unofficial long range aimed fire weapon, with the Minimi taking up over the fire support role.<br><br><img src="http://www.scaar.at/airsoft/l86-1.jpg"><br><br>The British experiment with a souped-up assault rifle for the fire support/SAW role is a clear demonstration of the failure of this concept.<br><br>It is unlikely SAF will adopt the LSW version of the SAR-21. In the seventies SAF experimented with the M-16HB with bipod for the LSW role and found it unsuitable. In the end the answer was a dedicated SAW the Ultimax. So it is unlikely we will go back to a LSW concept based on the SAR-21.<br><br>The most interesting development in this area is the USMC's nre requirement for what they term as a IAR - Infantry Automatic Rifle. They were evaluating the Ultimax for this though I don't know the outcome.<br><br>This is interesting because this is taking place more than a decade after they have adopted the M249 as a SAW. Perhaps they are now finally realizing that that the M249 really no more than a GPMG firing 5.56mm. A S.A.W. IT IS NOT.<br><br></div>
