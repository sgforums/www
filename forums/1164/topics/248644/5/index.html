            <div class='col-md body'>Why increase the ROF? You'll remove most of the advantage of the constant recoil system in which the U100 is the strongest of all the SAWs, and that is to send a lot of rounds into a smaller group then most other systems in the world.<br><br>Also, from my personal experience with the thing... the ROF is more then enough to splatter or supress anything on the recieving end of it.<br><br>As to if it should be replaced, I don't know. I am in favour of a new SAW built on the lessons of the U100, they can call it the U200 or Ultimax 2 if they want, given the Yanks themselves are also looking into getting a next gen SAW (not XM8 variant) that is LIGHTER then the U100 (obviously though, given all the advances in technology).<br><br>So do we wait until all the tech matures before coming up with a new SAW and stick with what we have now?</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hi,<br><br>The Ultimax's 100-rd drum magazine can be hand- loaded without any acessories in the field.<br><br>Back in 1994-1993, when my NSF platoon conducted day and night gunnery live-firings, each soldier in the platoon and more fired 90-rds each with the drum mag on the SAW.  There were 3 SAW at the firing points.  We did not oil the drum mag.  The only field care we performed was to oil the barrel and the chamber after each firing details.  Sustained bursts were fired too, though avoided since the rounds drifted away from the targets.  We loaded 90 rds instead of 100rds to avoid mag malfunction due to no-spring tension.<br><br>I guess it is for practical reasons that S'pore infantry and other foot-sloggers are not equipped with the 100rd drums.  I was/am transported on armour vehicle.  I have a mechanized mule to lug the cumbersome fully- loaded 4x100rd drum carrier around.  Fully loaded, the 4x100rd drum carrier is HEAVY.  Look at the GIs and Australian Diggers in the Vietnam War.  The big buggers were carrying minimum essential combat load to function effectively in the harsh weather and difficult terrain conditions.  Fast forward to the Presence, the lesson is still applicable.  Keep the individual soldiers' skeleton battle order light so that we can be effective in Asia environment.<br><br>I recalled a study done by SPC, Soldier Performance Center, in the 90's.  For an average soldier to remain combat effective in combat tempo, his individual combat load should be limited to 15% of his body weight.  When we conduct route marches in the past, we went to great length to distribute our platoon stores and combat load among the soldiers.  Now, with more electronic gadgets, more batteries and maintenance kits, we have to introduce the Load-Bearing Vest, bigger full-pack to lug the load!!! It is not gung-hu at all. We had to wear armour vest now since we are weight-down and lumbering.   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"> Singapre's foot-sloggers' days just got tougher.</div>

Do you guys carry them for training? Are they some kind of back pack? Or some cross-sling bandolier? Many people say that changing mag on a U100 is fast. I guess this depends largely on how easy is this drum carrier to use.<br><br><blockquote>Originally posted by aikchongtan:<strong><br>Keep the individual soldiers' skeleton battle order light so that we can be effective in Asia environment.  </strong></blockquote>Anyone who've stumbled through a pitch black forest at night on a 10km movement to contact will agree.<br><br><blockquote>Originally posted by aikchongtan:<strong><br>For an average soldier to remain combat effective in combat tempo, his individual combat load should be limited to 15% of his body weight.  </strong></blockquote>I carried at least 25kg including the ancient radio equipment, that's about 40+% of my body weight.

            <div class='col-md body'>Hi,<br><br>Can't imagine an average SAF SAW gunner going on assault with 4xdrum mag and 9xbox mag.  As it is clearing SOC will be a nightmare <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_redface.gif" alt="Embarassed" title="Embarassed">   During my NSF days, the 4 drums were carried in a sling-style carrier.  Imagine a Milo-tin with one sling except that the tin open sideway with 4 divided- space.<br><br>SAF fighting doctrine is blitz-oriented.  That mentality permeates down all the way to the infantry section tactics.  Compare our 7-men infantry section to the traditional 9&gt;men fighting section, our fire footprint is heavier but narrow. The limitation in frontage has to be mitigated by aggressive maneouver by each member of the section.<br><br>When we assault, the self-contained SAW gunners leap &amp; bound forward as well as part of the assault element.  They fix bayonent as well.  Such aggressive tactics serve to carry the enemy ahead of us as we close in. No quarters are given nor asked when we have to fight with lesser strength.  Your unit's aggressive posturing &amp; attitude will intimidate the enemy and exponentially heighten your unit's confidence and integrity.  Such aggressive tactics were ably demonstrated by WWI German storm-troopers and WWII SSs and more recently, in Falkland conflict by the British paras.  It is brutally effective when you have the determination and brawn to pull it off.  At such close range, when the fire-fight is vicious and you can see the white of your enemy's eye, box mag is faster to switch;  remedying stoppages is less heart-stopping.  (GPMG gunners are equipped with small capacity assault mag for such situation).<br><br>GPMG, HMG and small-calibre cannon fitted with tripod, pintles and etc should be dedicated to the stand-off sustained firing role.  Their barrels are constructed for such express purpose.  I can't imagine a section carrying half-dozen of spare SAW barrel for close-in fighting.  I would rather carry more M203 / hand grenades and box mags for sharing with my riflemen and SAW gunners.<br><br>Of course, having said all of the above, I love the drum mag <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz"> They are reliable and simple to use.  In fixed positions, when we are emplaced, the drum mag is a real confidence boaster against infantry assault waves.</div>

Thats a very good mod to the Ultimax100. Most of the problem i experience before seems to be rectified. The magazine well seems to be deeper by a lot, thus preventing magazine droping off. They seem to have introduce some polymer casing to protect some parts of the ultimax. A good red dot aiming sight over the crappy iron sights.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hi,<br><br>Take a closer look at the twin-drum mag for this modified version.  When loaded on the weapon, it will give the SAW a fatter side profile compared to the present 100rd single-drum mag.  It utilized a tall M16-style box mag lip to feed rounds from both drums into the weapon.  The twin-drums distribute the ammo load evenly on both sides of the weapon.  The 100rd single drum mag will protrude and occupy more space below the weapon.  In ergonomic sense, both drum designs are unsuitable for close-in fighting.  Otherwise, let's equip all our riflemen with drum mag for their SAR21<img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">  Let find out more about the mag design specification and field trial observation before we conclude on the reliability of both design.<br><br>Based on this modification, I assume the Americans are uneasy with the current well-less mag feed construction.  Since the side-mounted 2-pin mag catch release button has been retained on this modified version, I assume the present 2-pin mag catch has been retained.<br><br>Actually, I see merits on the well-less design.  Allow easier access to clean the firing chamber and clear any stoppages such as double feeding, ruptured cartridges and etc.  My platoon never encounter the mag-drop-by-accident scenario.  Anyone care to share their personal experience?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"></div>

And it made me kinda dissapointed given I was looking forward to shredding some stuff with automatic fire.<br><br>It could be due to the fact that the weapons we were using at SISPEC were simply very old and at the end of their service life. Some were even field-modded hybrids of Mk.2 guns with Mk.3 parts! So one can get an idea of their general state of repair. I'm not too surprised that some are not FFF.<br><br>On the other hand, at another life shoot, the U100 I was using worked well and burned through all my mags with any issue. It was lots of fun then.<br><br>Warstock will probably quite a lot more reliable, given the weapons themselves will be more or less mint condition.<br><br>The U100 is hopless at shooting blanks though, often becoming a bolt action sniper rifle and the silly pouch for collecting the RAI they designed just does not work most and ends up broken most of the time.<br><br></div>

Times have changed!!<br><br>Anyway, SAF blanks don't work on the U100 simply because they are too weak to cycle the heavier bolt. That plus the blank attachment is usually faulty.<br><br>And maybe the constant recoil system of the U100 means the bolt travel longer distance. Despite nearly 4 decades of cursing and swearing by countless generations of NS men, SAF persist on using a shxtty blank cartridge that is simply NOT up to the job.<br><br>It can barely cycle an M16, let alone a LMG.<br><br>EDIT: What's a "C tool"?</div>
