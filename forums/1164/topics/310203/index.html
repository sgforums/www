              <p>btw, just for lionnoisy's sake before he goes off tooting more horns this is nothing new and there is something better has already been done long before we came up with our UAF:</p>
              <p> </p>
              <blockquote>
              <p>The Operations Center itself lies along one side of a main tunnel bored almost a mile through the solid granite heart of the mountain. The tunnel is designed to route the worst of a blast's shock wave out the other end, past the two 25-ton blast doors that mark one wall. The center was designed to withstand up to a 30 megaton blast within 1 nautical mile.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The underground Combat Operations Center (COC) was originally intended to provide a 70% probability of continuing to function if a five-<a class="mw-redirect" title="Megaton" href="http://sgforums.com/wiki/Megaton"><span style="color: #0000ff;">megaton</span></a> <a title="Nuclear weapon" href="http://sgforums.com/wiki/Nuclear_weapon"><span style="color: #0000ff;">nuclear weapon</span></a> detonated three <a title="Mile" href="http://sgforums.com/wiki/Mile"><span style="color: #0000ff;">miles</span></a> (5.6 <a class="mw-redirect" title="Kilometer" href="http://sgforums.com/wiki/Kilometer"><span style="color: #0000ff;">km</span></a>) away, but was ultimately built to withstand a multimegaton blast within 1.5 nautical miles (2.8 <a class="mw-redirect" title="Kilometer" href="http://sgforums.com/wiki/Kilometer"><span style="color: #0000ff;">km</span></a>). It was also designed to be self-sufficient for brief periods, have backup communications and television intercom with related commands, house personnel during an emergency, and protect staff against fallout and biological and chemical warfare.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The main entrance to the complex is about one-third of a mile (540 m) from the North Portal via a tunnel which leads to a pair of 25-ton steel <a class="mw-redirect" title="Blast door" href="http://sgforums.com/wiki/Blast_door"><span style="color: #0000ff;">blast doors</span></a>. Behind them is a steel building complex built within a 4.5 acre (18,000 m²) grid of excavated chambers and tunnels and surrounded by 2,000 feet (600 m) of <a title="Granite" href="http://sgforums.com/wiki/Granite"><span style="color: #0000ff;">granite</span></a>. The main excavation consists of three chambers 45 feet (15 m) wide, 60 feet (20 m) high, and 588 feet (180 m) long, intersected by four chambers 32 feet (10 m) wide, 56 feet (17 m) high and 335 feet (100 m) long. Fifteen buildings, freestanding without contact with the rock walls or roofs and joined by flexible vestibule connections, make up the inner complex. Twelve of these buildings are three stories tall; the others are one and two stories.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The outer shell of the buildings is made of three-eighths-inch (9.5 mm) continuously welded low carbon steel plates which are supported by structural steel frames. Metal walls and tunnels serve to attenuate electromagnetic pulse (EMP). Metal doors at each building entrance serve as fire doors to help contain fire and smoke. Emphasis on the design of the structure is predicated on the effects of nuclear weapons; however, building design also makes it possible for the complex to absorb the shock of <a title="Earthquake" href="http://sgforums.com/wiki/Earthquake"><span style="color: #0000ff;">earthquakes</span></a>.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><a title="Blast valve" href="http://sgforums.com/wiki/Blast_valve"><span style="color: #0000ff;">Blast valves</span></a>, installed in reinforced concrete bulkheads, have been placed in the exhaust and air intake supply, as well as water, fuel, and sewer lines. Sensors at the North and South Portal entrances will detect overpressure waves from a nuclear explosion, causing the valves to close and protect the complex. All of the buildings in the complex are mounted on 1,319 steel springs, each weighing about 1,000 pounds (450 kg). The springs allow the complex to move 12 inches (30 cm) in any one direction. To make the complex self-sufficient, adequate space in the complex is devoted to support functions. A dining facility, medical facility with dental office, pharmacy and a two-bed ward; two physical fitness centers with exercise equipment and sauna; a small base exchange and barber shop are all located within the complex.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Electricity comes primarily from the city of Colorado Springs, with six 1,750 kilowatt diesel generators for backup.</p>
              <p>Water for the complex comes from an underground supply inside Cheyenne Mountain, deposited into four excavated reservoirs with a capacity of 1.5 million US gallons (6,000 m³) of water. Three serve as industrial reservoirs and the remaining one is the complex’s primary domestic water source. They are so large that workers sometimes cross them in rowboats. About 30,000 to 120,000 US gallons are actually retained at any given time.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Incoming air may be filtered through a system of chemical/biological/radiological (CBR) filters to remove harmful germs and/or radioactive and chemical particles. The fresh air intake is mainly from the south portal access which is 17 ½ feet (5.3 m) high and 15 feet (4.6 m) wide and linked to the north portal access which is 22 ½ feet (7 m) high and 29 feet (9 m) wide. The entire tunnel from north to south entry portals is nine-tenths of a mile (1.5 km) long.</p>

              <p>As you like to say, the info is out there go and find it for yourself.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The fact that you think this is OSA shows how ignorant you are, and the lack of ability to source any articles beyond what's bad with ADF and what's the latest thing ST or the SAF is doing.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Which is unfortunate, because the features of our UAF is really nothing special, unless you happen to be the layman. The things you like to highlight in red are the common sense differences between a normal surface ammo dump and an underground facility. If we really made a surface ammo dump with these features then it would indeed be something to toot about.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>But as it stands no, what was done in mandai was a common-sense solution that is an interesting engineering feat, but nothing really earth-shatteringly original and as the article I pointed out shows, the Yanks have already perfected this technology and used it for more important military purposes long before we even started to dig into mandai.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>So seriously, this is another case of you going "can Skyblade be made to fire missiles or can Fantail be made to crash into things".  </p>

              <p>Oh, our unlearned forumer here has yet again showed his inability to understand simple logic and facts.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Indeed, the technology and method to build underground harderned structures has been around for decades, the Yanks did it with Cheyenne Mountain (to an extent far more extensive and a standard far higher then our UAF) and even the Taliban used cave complexes that wistood the might of the Soviet army (thou it was far less sucessful against the yanks)</p>
              <p>The fact that the DSTA had to conduct research into this area was not because they were coming up with anything new, but because they actually lagged behind and needed to play catch-up in the area of such construction. Indeed, our UAF is a peanut feat compared to what was done decades ago with Cheyenne Mountain. Being able to wistand a 250 ton explosion is nothing compared to the 30 MEGATON near miss range that Cheyenne mountain was not only intended to survive, but also remain functional. And remember this was done with cold-war era technology.</p>
              <p>So what's so special about our UAF? Nothing really, except you seem to think effort and money spent equates to a real competence in such technology... in this case it more likely points out to our INEXPERIENCE in this area... certainly something you would not like to toot.</p>
              <p>The only reason it seems that you see the need to toot your horn about this, seems to be ignorance.</p>
              <p>Exactly, what is your reason for thinking that some of the stuff made by ST is really "damn good" and then want to crash it into stuff besides having exactly no idea of what you are talking about?</p>

              <p>but the minister said,</p>
              <p>"As it is the <strong>first of its kind</strong> in the world, the UAF team could not rely on industrial norms.In many areas, solutions to enhance the safety and efficiency of the facility had to be engineered from scratch. <br>Until we embarked on this project, available information on structural responses to a blast were all based on earthquakes or mine blastings."</p>
              <p>1. First of what kind??</p>
              <p>2. If it is first in something, means nobody has done it before. And thus I am confused. I'm sure the Americans have done this before. I remember watching a documentary about USAF and their NATO counterparts having a training somewhere for their air force. And they stored their ammunitions in an underground ammo depot located in a mountain miles away from the airbase. However, that mountain is really far from civilization.</p>
              <p>So, what does <strong>first of its kind </strong>means in the above quote?</p>
              <p>Anyway, lionnoisy...have you done NS? And it's really impractical to crash a UAV at something...much less a bunch of soldiers. It is like buying a very powerful Mac or Sony laptop and then throwing it at a colony of invading ants. "UAVs" that does that crashes into soldiers and objects are called cruise missiles. Lol!</p>

              <p><strong>ABSTRACT</strong></p>
              <p>System safety has been recognised as an effective tool to analyse the risks and hazards associated with the construction and usage of a facility. In Singapore, the Defence Science &amp; Technology Agency (DSTA) has been entrusted with the development of an Underground Ammunition Facility (UAF). System safety was not mandated as a requirement when the project was conceptualised.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Although the facility was designed to comply with the existing industrial codes for buildings and infrastructure, and ammunition storage, the Ministry of Defence (MINDEF) and DSTA decided to implement a retrospective system safety assessment of the facility to take stock of the residual risks and improve downstream design to enhance safety considerations. It is also the intention of MINDEF to continue with the system safety activities when the facility is handed over to the operations and support phase.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>As the system safety activities were introduced retrospectively, the construction of some components of the facilities is in progress whilst some aspects of the construction work are in the final planning stage. This mixture of retrospective cum prospective activities makes this system safety effort intriguing. This paper discusses the approach adopted to tackle the challenges under these situations.</p>

              <p>Yawn... you still don't get it do you? And expected you resorted to cutting and pasting articles just like your Fantail thread when you kept pasting pictures of "FRAGMENTATION" and "SHAPED CHARGE" without even know what it really means.</p>
              <p>Whatever DSTA did, it does not really matter. It's nothing new... water mitigation (do you even know what it means?) or not it does not change the fact that way larger and more complex underground facilities have already been built to a higher standard (30 megaton blast within 1 nm) decades before.</p>
              <p>What's new about our UAF? Except that the only thing you know is to find DSTA articles and think they're really "damn good"? Which sadly, isn't true.</p>

              <p>Yawn... you still don't get it do you? And expected you resorted to cutting and pasting articles just like your Fantail thread when you kept pasting pictures of "FRAGMENTATION" and "SHAPED CHARGE" without even know what it really means.</p>
              <p>Whatever DSTA did, it does not really matter. It's nothing new... water mitigation (do you even know what it means?) or not it does not change the fact that way larger and more complex underground facilities have already been built to a higher standard (30 megaton blast within 1 nm) decades before.</p>
              <p>What's new about our UAF? Except that the only thing you know is to find DSTA articles and think they're really "damn good"? Which sadly, isn't true.</p>

              <p>You know, putting the two uncertain (since you chose to put a question mark at the end of it) "ha ha"s at the end of your last post is ironic, given that now you have truly made a laughing stock out of yourself.</p>
              <p>Do you know the sheer difference between the 250 ton blast the UAF was rated to and a 30 MEGATON blast?</p>
              <p>Since you're so good at sourcing articles why don't you go do your research and realize the sheer difference in complexity and size between Mandai UAF and Cheyenne Mountain?</p>
              <p>Here's a clue: your lastest post is akin to arguing that some ST made Minesweeper is equal to an American Nimitz class carrier.</p>

              <p>Yawn, repeating your postings by copying and pasting again does not really help your position. And I think it's quite a lot of entertainment to see you get pwned, the mods will agree.</p>
              <p>You tried to paint the achievements of DSTA in building the UAF as akin to Cheyenne Mountain shows quite plainly that you do not even know what you are talking about, and yet try to carry on with your plainly silly line of argument.</p>
              <p>Best, you even tried to suggest that Mandai UAF is rated for 30 Megatons! Do you even know what a megaton is?</p>
              <p>Please, as stated before, there's nothing really special about our UAF... except that you are trying to make it special by being ignorant about better feats out there that have already been long done.</p>

              <p>The Operations Center itself lies along one side of a main tunnel bored almost a mile through the solid granite heart of the mountain. The tunnel is designed to route the worst of a blast's shock wave out the other end, past the two 25-ton blast doors that mark one wall. The center was designed to withstand up to a 30 megaton blast within 1 nautical mile.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The underground Combat Operations Center (COC) was originally intended to provide a 70% probability of continuing to function if a five-<a title="Megaton" rel="nofollow" href="/wiki/Megaton"><span style="color: #0000ff;">megaton</span></a> <a title="Nuclear weapon" rel="nofollow" href="/wiki/Nuclear_weapon"><span style="color: #0000ff;">nuclear weapon</span></a> detonated three <a title="Mile" rel="nofollow" href="/wiki/Mile"><span style="color: #0000ff;">miles</span></a> (5.6 <a title="Kilometer" rel="nofollow" href="/wiki/Kilometer"><span style="color: #0000ff;">km</span></a>) away, but was ultimately built to withstand a multimegaton blast within 1.5 nautical miles (2.8 <a title="Kilometer" rel="nofollow" href="/wiki/Kilometer"><span style="color: #0000ff;">km</span></a>). It was also designed to be self-sufficient for brief periods, have backup communications and television intercom with related commands, house personnel during an emergency, and protect staff against fallout and biological and chemical warfare.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The main entrance to the complex is about one-third of a mile (540 m) from the North Portal via a tunnel which leads to a pair of 25-ton steel <a title="Blast door" rel="nofollow" href="/wiki/Blast_door"><span style="color: #0000ff;">blast doors</span></a>. Behind them is a steel building complex built within a 4.5 acre (18,000 m²) grid of excavated chambers and tunnels and surrounded by 2,000 feet (600 m) of <a title="Granite" rel="nofollow" href="/wiki/Granite"><span style="color: #0000ff;">granite</span></a>. The main excavation consists of three chambers 45 feet (15 m) wide, 60 feet (20 m) high, and 588 feet (180 m) long, intersected by four chambers 32 feet (10 m) wide, 56 feet (17 m) high and 335 feet (100 m) long. Fifteen buildings, freestanding without contact with the rock walls or roofs and joined by flexible vestibule connections, make up the inner complex. Twelve of these buildings are three stories tall; the others are one and two stories.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The outer shell of the buildings is made of three-eighths-inch (9.5 mm) continuously welded low carbon steel plates which are supported by structural steel frames. Metal walls and tunnels serve to attenuate electromagnetic pulse (EMP). Metal doors at each building entrance serve as fire doors to help contain fire and smoke. Emphasis on the design of the structure is predicated on the effects of nuclear weapons; however, building design also makes it possible for the complex to absorb the shock of <a title="Earthquake" rel="nofollow" href="/wiki/Earthquake"><span style="color: #0000ff;">earthquakes</span></a>.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><a title="Blast valve" rel="nofollow" href="/wiki/Blast_valve"><span style="color: #0000ff;">Blast valves</span></a>, installed in reinforced concrete bulkheads, have been placed in the exhaust and air intake supply, as well as water, fuel, and sewer lines. Sensors at the North and South Portal entrances will detect overpressure waves from a nuclear explosion, causing the valves to close and protect the complex. All of the buildings in the complex are mounted on 1,319 steel springs, each weighing about 1,000 pounds (450 kg). The springs allow the complex to move 12 inches (30 cm) in any one direction. To make the complex self-sufficient, adequate space in the complex is devoted to support functions. A dining facility, medical facility with dental office, pharmacy and a two-bed ward; two physical fitness centers with exercise equipment and sauna; a small base exchange and barber shop are all located within the complex.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Electricity comes primarily from the city of Colorado Springs, with six 1,750 kilowatt diesel generators for backup.</p>
              <p>Water for the complex comes from an underground supply inside Cheyenne Mountain, deposited into four excavated reservoirs with a capacity of 1.5 million US gallons (6,000 m³) of water. Three serve as industrial reservoirs and the remaining one is the complex’s primary domestic water source. They are so large that workers sometimes cross them in rowboats. About 30,000 to 120,000 US gallons are actually retained at any given time.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Incoming air may be filtered through a system of chemical/biological/radiological (CBR) filters to remove harmful germs and/or radioactive and chemical particles. The fresh air intake is mainly from the south portal access which is 17 ½ feet (5.3 m) high and 15 feet (4.6 m) wide and linked to the north portal access which is 22 ½ feet (7 m) high and 29 feet (9 m) wide. The entire tunnel from north to south entry portals is nine-tenths of a mile (1.5 km) long.</p>

              <blockquote><span>Stackable containers within the facility ensure that space is fully utilised, and the system is automated so that ammunition can be retrieved and sent out to the field in a short time. <br><br>The granite caverns also offer natural insulation, cutting by half the energy required to cool the contents and minimise the risks associated with ammunition storage. <br><br>The underground system replaces the old Seletar East ammunition depot. <br><br>By building the facility below ground, about 300 hectares of land - or the equivalent to 400 football fields - are freed above ground for other developments. <br></span>

              <h3>Prepared for war</h3>
              <p> </p>
              <p>In the bowels of the complex, all comparisons to an ordinary office building are quickly forgotten. The complex is designed to house its staff in complete physical isolation, with enough food, water and fuel to last 30 days. Air, brought in from the outside, is filtered to remove radioactive, chemical or biological hazards.</p>
              <p>Throughout the ceilings of the complex, some 113,000 bolts, measuring 6 to 32 feet (1 to 5 meters) in length, are drilled into the rock; two non-commissioned officers are employed to tighten those bolts full-time. The bolts add structural strength to the inside of the mountain, making up for all the tons of rock that were removed.</p>
              <p>Like the connections between floor segments, the connections between hose and pipe segments are designed to be flexible. The entire complex is mounted on huge springs, designed to absorb the shock of an earthquake or an explosion.</p>
              <p>During its Cold War-era reign, the Cheyenne Mountain Operations Center collected data from a worldwide system of satellites, radars, and other sensors and processed that information in real-time. Operations were conducted 24 hours a day, 365 days a year in the Air Warning Center, Missile Warning Center, Space Control Center, Operational Intelligence Watch, Systems Center, Weather Center, and the Command Center.<br><br>While most of the day-to-day operations have since moved to nearby <a title="Peterson Air Force Base" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peterson_Air_Force_Base"><span style="color: #5588aa;">Peterson Air Force Base</span></a>, <a title="NORAD" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NORAD"><span style="color: #5588aa;">NORAD</span></a> still maintains the Cheyenne Mountain Directorate for use in the event of an emergency.<br><br>The facility is one of the most unusual installations in the world - apart from the fact that it is housed 2,000 <a title="Foot (unit of length)" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foot_%28unit_of_length%29"><span style="color: #5588aa;">feet</span></a> (600 <a title="Metre" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metre"><span style="color: #5588aa;">m</span></a>) underground, it is also remarkable in that it was a joint and bi-national military organization comprising over 200 men and women from the <a title="United States Army" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Army"><span style="color: #5588aa;">Army</span></a>, <a title="United States Navy" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Navy"><span style="color: #5588aa;">Navy</span></a>, <a title="United States Marine Corps" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Marine_Corps"><span style="color: #5588aa;">Marine Corps</span></a>, <a title="United States Air Force" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Air_Force"><span style="color: #5588aa;">Air Force</span></a>, and <a title="Canada" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canada"><span style="color: #5588aa;">Canadian</span></a> forces.<br><br>The entrance to the facility is marked by two 25 ton blast doors and the entire underground base was designed to withstand up to a 30 megaton blast within 1 nautical mile. Twelve of the fifteen buildings are 3 stories tall, the others are one and two stories. These buildings are all free standing and mounted on 1319 giant springs each weighing 1,000 pounds (450kg) to help it withstand a nuclear blast and/or earthquakes. The springs allow it the entire complex to move 12 inches in any one direction.</p>
