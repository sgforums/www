            <div class='col-md body'>Russian troops today stormed a school in southern Russia and secured the building where an armed gang, believed to be Chechen rebels, took hundreds of children, parents and teachers hostage on Wednesday. Interfax news agency said dozens of people had been killed in the collapse of the roof at the school where hostages were held. A British ITV News reporter said up to 100 bodies were seen in the school gymnasium....The Spetnaz(is it?) took the job as usual with fast action and DEADLY results...reminds me of the other case...at the opera house...all the terrorists were eliminated with dozens of civilian casualties...now the case is in the build up area of BESLAN, Russia...there are still some of the terrorist on run hiding in the neighbourhood...could the casualties be avoided?...like to hear your views...<br><br>God Bless the casualties souls...<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>There were rumours that the actual number of hostages inside were much higher, aprox 1500.The death toll of 200 is around 15%, which statistically speaking is quite good when you take into account the militants fanaticism and willingness to blow up everyone increasing day by day.The call had to be made.I hope those who participated in the operations can sleep at night knowing that 200 hostages died and yet there was not much else that could have been done.Special Ops units have that extra burden on their souls for being the ones who end lives and having to save them at the same time.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>It's a savage affair, &amp; - still - forgive me for being naturally suspicious about any "official" account of what went down.<br><br>Other than that, I do think the Russians need to relook their whole strategy of internal security, so that standoffs like the school &amp;, previously, theater sieges are nipped in the bud as much as possible. It's plainly a failure of counterinsurgency intelligence, period.<br><br>On paper, their post-KGB security organization appears mightily bureaucratic: 5 separate agencies, each with its own many directorates/departments &amp; sub-directorates. Boris Yeltsin's "democractic" legacy had their security apparatus, along with countering terrorism, also checking ethnic separatism, labor unrest, drug trafficking, organized crime, counterintelligence against foreign spies &amp;, supposedly the bigger priority of all, the President's political opponents.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>The Russian SpecOps unit involved in the raid is from the FSB's Alpha unit.  They are very well trained in anti-terrorist works, from a Russian point of view.  Had it been for the military's Spetnaz, the result would probably be much different as seen in their past actions.  Spetnaz are far more fast &amp; brutal then any other SpecOps.  They don't believe in givng the enemy any chances or any worry for colleteral damages.<br><br>During their time in Afghanistan, a Russian diplomat was captured by the Taliburn who demanded the release of their fighters.  Spetnaz reply by kinapping the child of the leader of the kinappers &amp; telling them that if the taliburn does not return the diplomat unharm, they would start slicing the child part by part for each day that goes by.  Of course, the diplomat was immediately released.<br><br>The russian internal security is weak because everyone is underpaid, so they just go through they job without seriousness.  Russian intelligent services are trying to remodel themselve to look less KGB &amp; more like CIA but they chose to be like the pre-911 CIA.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Being in the UK, I saw the news almost live a few days ago. I also saw the latest news last night. The death toll is now 300+ with another 70+ injured badly. Quite a lot are adults, either teachers, parents or soldiers.<br><br>From the news analysis, it appears that the Russian force committed the following errors:-<br><br>1) Security cordon around the school was lax<br>2) Not sure which terrorist to negotiate with<br>3) Wrong assessment of the terrorist intent (their intent is actually to committ suicide in any case and not to bargain)<br>4) Immediate assault plan was not present or did not come in time (usually in a hostage situation, the rescuers would have improvised a immediate assault plan like our SAF IA drill. To take care of unforeseen events like the sudden detonation of explosives and no-warning killing of hostages.<br><br>Major boo-boo by the Russians. Of course, their defence would be that the hostage group was very large and the school compound is quite big. From the news photos, it looked slightly bigger than a Junior College in Singapore.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I hate to say these but if this incident happened back in the days of the USSR, the safety of the hostages would've meant nothing to the KGB.  Instead, they would focus on the meaning of anti-terrorism.  And then the KGB would probably settle any complain by saying that the hostages had died for the fatherland &amp; that the hostages would be consider heros.<br><br>So, personally, I'm not surprise by the current result of their unprofessional handling of both this incident &amp; the earlier theater incident.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_neutral.gif" alt="Neutral" title="Neutral"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by John Ching:</div><div class="quote_body">I hate to say these but if this incident happened back in the days of the USSR, the safety of the hostages would've meant nothing to the KGB.  Instead, they would focus on the meaning of anti-terrorism.  And then the KGB would probably settle any complain by saying that the hostages had died for the fatherland &amp; that the hostages would be consider heros.<br><br>So, personally, I'm not surprise by the current result of their unprofessional handling of both this incident &amp; the earlier theater incident.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_neutral.gif" alt="Neutral" title="Neutral"> </div></blockquote>i would hate to say this...but in the days of the USSR this wont even happen....why? if they had rebelled in they're state.....russia would just flatten the damn place</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I was in Netherlands when I catched this news.<br><br>According to CNN, there were around 20 over militants and most of them were either killed or captured. Some of them were of Arab origin.......<br><br>The news said that the soldiers were sending in the food and drinks for the hostages. The militants were using the hostages as a human shield. Just then, the hostages panic and started running for safety, the militant starts shooting and all hell break loose.<br><br>The authority then was taken aback by this sudden development and have no choice but to take immediate actions.. The Russian Special force than proceeded to blow a hole by the side of the Gym but the militant has booby trapped the gym ceiling with explosive. Upon detonation, part of the ceiling collapsed and crashed down on the hostages in the gym. A video man from CNN also managed to captured some video of bodies being buried under rubbles and charred beyong recognition.<br><br>While that fight were going on, hostages were running out of the building....<br><br>Saw image of the Russian Special forces firing at the window while urging hostages to run out and the fireman trying to stop the flame.<br><br>Last confirmed(at Netherlands on 5th Sept 2004), causaulity were 322 dead with 700 wounded. Some of the dead are no older than 5 yo......<br><br>It is a sad day for the Russians.........</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>A case in switzerland a decade or so ago. The hostages held in a opera theatre died ...cos the special task unit deploy a "rescue" plan which used a lethal gas .....Most of the hostages never wake up from the coma and died.<br><br>The RUSSIAN government should be held accountable. ESPECIALLY THE CHIEF EXECUTIVE RULER...IN THIS CASE President Putin</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>i think the problem lies with Russia's special forces ie: the Spetsnaz/FSB "Alfa" units. they are simply not well trained in CT and CQB skills thats why they have very"wacky" ideas like using gas or take out the roof to save the hostages. i am not a por but i think situations like this calls for patience and detailed planning</div>
