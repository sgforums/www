            <div class='col-md body'>Please, it's not 100 percent. The external training programmes as reported in the news was just transport plane pilots. And you need to cut cost and save manpower! It's just those 5 tonners and maybe some other non-essential vehicles you don't see us leasing out helos do we?<br><br>Other countries such as the US hire external companys to help in certain training too as i've heard.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Well, that's what happens when u have more trucks than drivers. U end up with a whole bunch of spanking new trucks with nothing to do. U think that subcontracting is not a good position to maintain? Easy solution: get married, have lots of kids, and encourage all your frens/relatives to do the same to help our SAF maintain sufficient manpower. "Stand up for Singapore" indeed.</div>
