            <div class='col-md body'>Seems not too many people are aware of this " old " news because all the details are kept somewhat secret.   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>[quote]<br><br><strong>F-16 Airframe Details for 91-0023 which was shot down by M2000 in 1996</strong><br><br><a href="http://www.f-16.net/f-16_fighting_falcon_airframe-3371.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.f-16.net/f-16_fighting_falcon_airframe-3371.html</a><br><br>Comments:<br>Crashed into the Aegean Sea nine miles off the island of Chios during a routine flight. It was part of a flight of four F-4's and two F-16's. Just prior to the mishap two Mirage 2000's intercepted them. One of two person crew was rescued but the other is missing. According to an official report, the TUAF formation had illegaly violated Hellenic airspace and so was intercepted by 2 HAF Mirage 2000EG (331sqn, 114FW, Tanagra AB). <strong>The 2 TUAF F-16s evidently denied to comply and started agressive maneuvers against the HAF Mirage 2000EG. During the engagment that followed, one of the HAF Mirage 2000EG (piloted by lt. Grivas) fired a Magic IR missile. As a result a TUAF F-16D (#91-0023) was shot down. </strong>Immediately the second TUAF F-16 paused the engagment and escaped to the east in order to return to international air space. It was later determined (and kept secret) that the downed pilot who survived from the crash was in fact an Israeli pilot (Osman CÃ½ceklÃ½) dispached from IDFAF. The second pilot (TUAF flight officer) failed to eject in time due to the missile hit and was killed. The downed pilot was rescued 30 min. after shot down by a HAF AB-205 SAR helo (from 358th search and rescue squadron). The pilot received immediate medical care and returned a few days later to Turkey with a HAF C-130 flight. <strong>At first the incident was kept secret for obvious purposes </strong>and both countries (Greece and Turkey) officialy adopted a mechanical failure as the main cause of the accident. In 2003 the Greek Minister of Defence, Mr. Giannos Papantoniou, stated in public that the incident of Oct. 8th, 1996, that led to the loss of the TUAF F-16D was a result of the immediate action that was taken by HAF fighters during an interception against TUAF fighters violating Greek airspace.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>ItÂ’s really not too much light shed on this matter, could be the successful PR efforts by the Americans if you compared to the tons of info covered the F16Â’s rather easily win over SerbÂ’s Mig29 in 1999. IMO, this classic dog fight carried between 2 3rd Gen fighters should be more referred, considering the pilots and AF size of both sides are comparable to each other.</div>

More likely is the F16 is armed and the plane thus lost some agilty. And based on record, these 2 F16s ( 1 -C, 1 -D) were sent to backup the 4 F-4s.<br><br>Anyway, because the lack of details, too many sayings are flown all around</div>

So the turks believe they are operating in International Airspace, while the Greeks think that the Turks are violating their airspace.<br><br>Naturally, if you THINK u are right, and you think u are in International Airspace, u wouldn't comply if someone asks u to leave a place which is rightfully free right?  So what will u do? Continue on your course, and ignore the bugger rite?<br><br>The Greeks now gets pissed.

And pulls hard together the F-16 for a Fox2.<br><br>Turk pilot goes "WTF" and bugs out.<br><br>OR.<br><br>2.  F-16 makes the Max-G break.  Turk pilot sees that and thinks they are being shot at, turns towards the Mirage flight and spikes the Mirage Flight.<br><br>Mirage pilot goes "WTF" with his already locked weapon and fires (probably doesnt have authority to shoot...) thinking that the Turks are returning fire.  Poor Israeli pilot gets shot down for doing the right thing with the wrong people...<br><br>Now, how is it that the F-16 gets out turned?  The F-16 was probably not in its corner airspeed, which is about 340-440 kts.  That is the speed which the F-16 makes the most radians per second.  Not gonna say how much exactly that is... but its enough to out turn most planes.<br><br>So was the F16s faster than 440, or lesser than 340?  If faster, they were probably in a hurry going somewhere.<br><br>IF slower, they were probably cruising along for wad ever reason they were told to.<br><br>But I'm pretty sure the Turks weren't planning to invade Greece with 2 F-16s.<br><br>All in all, its still the Greek Mirage 2000 flight that has the more aggressive mission profile.

IF he doesnt execute a quick break, he would really stand a chance if a missile had already been fired.   In war, this would not apply, but because its during peace time, u dun really know if the other guy really gonna shoot or not.<br><br>From the HUD, the MIRAGE2000 seems to be pulling a 5g lead turn @ 22 degree AOA to the right.   THe range is close enough for guns.   F-16 is probably pulling a bit more gs, pulling up a little, perhaps attempting to increase closure rate to generate an overshoot.  High-G Yoyo.<br><br>I'm not familiar with the Mirage 2000 HUD symbology, but it looks like the distance btween them is mostly 1250 ft, with Mirage 2000 at a closure rate of 40knots.  Mirage is making 283 knots, so F-16 should be about 243 knots... but since the Mirage is approaching at this angle, i would guess that both aircraft are about the same airspeed.  280 knots is not the F-16s corner airspeed, which means it can't make turns as sharply there.  The Guns symbology is similar to the F-16's snapshoot line though.<br><br>It still doesn't really tell us much about the situation or the set up.  This probably shows the endgame... any other shots?<br><br>They could have been turning around for a while before this occured which might explain why the F-16 is at such below optimal dogfight speed.<br><br>About the Immelman, I don't see how it would help by pulling up n turning, and potentially losing eye-contact with the bandit.  If indeed its head on approach, u're gonna die anyways cos the'd just launch at u pulling up, while you're losing airspeed.  You simply don't dodge bullets by losing airspeed.<br><br>IF the F-16 was the one that initiated the fight, I would think He'd put the Mirage 30 degrees laterally off his nose... and opt for a 1 circle fight since the Mirage was equipped with an all-aspect missile. This would make it a little bit harder for the Mirage to get good launch perimeters.  This HUD shot does look like it was taken after a half-assed attempt at a 1 circle fight by the F-16.  Any gun cam videos for a clearer picture?<br><br>No air to ground ordinance that would suggest that the F-16 was heavily ladened and could not out manuever.  Then again, if any, they should have been jettisoned.  In fact, I don't even see sidewinders on the F-16...<br><br>Finally, we don't know if the F-16s TURNED towards the Mirage 2000s after seeing them pop up on the RWR.  That is a rather aggressive action to take in international airspace... Its better to just ignore and plod along being escorted out rather than get into a dogfight.<br><br>PS. Anyone familiar with Mirage 2000 symbologies?</div>

The other thing a pilot wonÂ’t delay to do in such situation is pulling out his bird from the reach of the AAM. And by which means? High G maneuver. In an assumed co-altitude/co-energy merge, itÂ’s obvious the 1st fighter makes the horizontal separation( turn left or right) will be in great disadvantage because you inevitable will explore your hot a$$ 1st to your opponent and receive a warm tailor-on shot. You dive, better still. Your opponent will catch the altitude advantage and in a down Â–shoot position, his AAM will gain energy while dashing down.<br><br>So the option left is you pulling up an option you so hard to accept but quite a common practice of many merge encountering. You only look at itÂ’s losing the speed but never notice that you are gaining the altitude and better angle to the off boresight of the opponent plane, and at the last, you can settle behind the bandit and above it if you like . As I said you maneuver because you want to escape the AAM and gain the position behind the opponent fighter. When the time u pull up and roll, the AAM tracking ur fighter also has to do the same. Depend on which one bleed energy fast and exhaust 1st. because you make the  Immelman 1st, you got the Â“ lead turnÂ”, if  unluckily the AAMÂ’s inertia makes the AAM passed your jet then the part of the AAMÂ’s energy inherent from its launching fighter will become negative, which means the AAM has actually use its limited energy to overcome its energy inherent from the inertia before purely used to catch you. Another disadvantage of the IR AAM is its seeker, the seeker always has to face your hottest spot and then determine the missileÂ’s next move, donÂ’t like the radar guided AAM, why so significant? Because you know, when your fighter in high G, the planeÂ’s hottest A$$ will always some times to the left, some times to the right, sometimes up, some times down while the fighterÂ’s nose will relatively not move such widely. Because the seeker always intend to follow your jetÂ’s hottest part, then the AAM most likely will travel in Â“SÂ” sharp while you plane just do smooth curve of Immelman. Which one bleed energy faster? The 1 with loop plus S sharp cat walk  or the 1 just do the smooth loop? Remember, the more G, the more energy you will lose. The more energy your opponent tend to lose, the more chance you win<br><br></div>
