The Brits also supplied Matildas and Valentines to the USSR at some point, it was more a case of grabbing whatever they could lay their hands on.

It was expensive, complex, unreliable, slow and more or less a heavily armoured 88mm mobile gun. That is good for some stuff but when you need to fight a war you'll realize that the disadvantages of the design become a real liability when you want to get things done.<br><br>No tank (except prehaps the Pershing, Comet and the Soviet Heavy tanks) was a match for the Tiger but the problem was that there simply wasn't enough Tigers around to make their superiority in firepower and armour turn the tide.<br><br>If the Germans had abandoned their plans for super tanks at all costs, and focused on their excellent Panther, things might have been quite different.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote>Originally posted by SingaporeTyrannosaur:<br>If the Germans had abandoned their plans for super tanks at all costs, and focused on their excellent Panther, things might have been quite different.</blockquote>I like the Panther, it's easily the sexiest WWII German tank but I think even if Panther production were tripled the outcome would still have been the same. More men would have died and perhaps an Allied division here or there mauled badly, maybe added 2, 3 months to the war in Europe but the end result would have been the same. On the East front, mountains of tanks, infantry and artillery would have crushed however many numbers the Germans would have cranked out, quantity is quality.<br><br>On the West Front, one factor alone would have been decisive. Absolute Allied air supremacy would have seen to making it difficult for the tanks to get to the front lines without getting shot at at least once and curtailing the supplies needed to run them effectively, especially fuel. American infantry while not as lavishly equipped with Bazookas as their German counterparts with Panzerfausts/Panzershreks would demonstrate in places like Mortain and Elsenborn Ridge that they could take on German armor and prevail to say nothing 76mm gunned Shermans, Jumbo Shermans and the johnny come lately Pershings.<br><br>Still, one wonders if production for the Mark IVs were dropped in favour of retooling to push out more Mark Vs....</div>

The problem you speak of is known as a shot trap and it became apparent in the earlier production models and the mantlet was redesigned to prevent such deflections from happening,<br><br>As for the 75 being crappy, no wai. It's not about the size of the gun in this case, the 75 mounted on the Panther was streets ahead of the 75 on the Sherman and in terms of armor penetration we're not even talking about the ammo differences. The longer barrelled gun (L/70 vs L/38 on a standard M4) mounted on the Panther had a higher muzzle velocity for one thing and it was supposedly terribly accurate beyond the effective range of it's counterpart on the Sherman. Can't kill something if it kills you first before you can reach your own effective killing range yourself.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>The T34 was the weapon and the tank that made the biggest contributions to the defeat of Nazi Germany. Thus, in history, due to the role that this tank played in the eastern front, this tank can be counted one of the best if not the best tank ever produced.<br><br>The strength of the T34 was that it was easily manufactured, with great simplicty in it's design and it can be produced in large numbers. The German forces simply was no match for a large force of T34 travelling in fast speed across the steepes of Russia. In addition, the German 88mm gun (which was originally a flak gun) was the only gun in the entire German armoury that could pierce through the plating of the T34 tank. Soviet T34s were more than a match for any German tanks that were fielded on the Eastern Front.<br><br>Compared to Soviet tanks at that period, the German armaments boards had too many tanks,too many different calibers of gun. German tanks (esp the Tigers and Panthers) were simply too complexed to be build in large numbers and  they often broke down while moving to the front and there were too few spare parts for the repair. In fact, Heinz Guderain, the Inspectorate of the Panzer forces requested for an increased procuction of the reliable Panzer III in place of the newer tanks sometime in 1944.<br><br>Perhaps the greatest compliment that the T34 could be given was that the Nazis tried to copy the design of the T34 in their own tanks.However, again they overlook the strength of the T34 by simply adding too many customisation to the tank. In fact, there was even a force of captured T34 used by the Nazis against the Soviets on the western front.<br><br>Thus, I give my vote to T34 as the greatest tank of the 20th century with the M1 Abrams and the Tiger followed behind.</div>
