Why they too turn away from MBT is the logistic issue. They have the problem of getting MBT to where the war is. The problem of Desert Storm totally highlighted that, it was a nightmare. They cannot use C-130, they need to use their heaviest lift planes and ships. It took months to get the tanks in place.<br><br>Imagine, what happen if iraq sink one of these ship, one whole armour group is under the sea. Also fuel, to supply a MBT battle group, which MBT drink fuel like crazy, which mean you will have lots of fuel tankers running around. That does not take much to knock out a supply group to totally immobile the best tank column. Because as good as the MBT, in future war , it may be taken out before it can even get to fight.<br><br>Anyway if someone can create a tank that is smaller and lighter and eat less fuel. That mean they can now deploy with weeks even with C-130. So even with less armour or smaller canon, with latest technology, even smaller canon can be more powerful.<br><br></div>

You know what is call bolt on amour, there is so many type ! Even the isrealis have that for their AMX-13, so not surprise if singapore too have.
