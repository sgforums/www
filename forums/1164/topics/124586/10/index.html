Remember the forms you signed before you ORD? Anyone here can be from MAF or TNI intell , anyone. Dun get baited and spew out things you had seen / previledge access to.Chances are things that you had seen/know of, there are people who had seen it or knew too. Just be careful of what you say, anywhere.<br>Used to have SBSK, and now this idwar. a similarity that I noticed. They like to bait for flaming,with senseless provocative thoughts and comments. then 1 or 2 people will spew out some stuff. simple tactic. For SBSK, the character was protrayed as pre-NS enlistee with " intellectual"  millitary tactics. idwar the character protrayed as matt yoyo.  The posts by this 2 character are baiting for info.Fishy fishy.  Bottomline is, take responsibility of what is been discuss here.</div></blockquote>You forgot Johnston the guns expert. Even if I despise him, I won't stoop to the level of <a href="http://www.sgforums.com/?action=profileview&amp;username=heng@" rel="nofollow">some troll</a> and taunt him. The same troll rounded on me like a wild beast when I asked a question about the Southern Cross at <a href="http://www.sgforums.com/?action=thread_display&amp;thread_id=126662&amp;page=2" rel="nofollow">another board</a>. He deserves to be cursed to the last surviving descendant. Worse, the mods didn't urge restraint, like our dear CenturionMBT telling us to maintain decorum and not stoop to Idwar's level.</div>
