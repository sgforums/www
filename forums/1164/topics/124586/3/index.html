Barely able to withstand 0.5 calibre machine guns.Hence, it is better for the amx 13 to play shoot and scoot rather than a direct confrontation. Sure we can place laminated or bolt on armor to the amx 13, but that would increase the weight of the amx 13 and reduce the power to weight ratio of the amx 13 drastically, hence defeating the purpose of its role.<br><br>one thing i don't really like about the amx 13 is that it does not have a stabilised turret. hence it cannot fire on the move. So by doing the stop shoot and scoot technique, you really lose plenty of precious time.<br><br>Tankee you can clearify that with me?<br><br>Otherwise, for what it was designed for, i believe it can excel in its role if it is used properly.</div>

You can upgrade it all you want but it remains a grandfather tank. And the turret gun elevation is of a funny French design that no tank has attempted to copy during the last 60 years. This funny design probably made it impossible to stabilise with gyro or anything.</div>

But if it has to move down an open road it is going to be attacked on its flanks. Thats why you must have a tank that navigates in a jungle. Read any books about the war in russia. what happened to the tigers that tried to move in a convoy along a straight road.<br><br>and fyi bridges ain't an excuse. if you think about it, to transport a 50 ton tank, you must have a bridge to be able to hold it. and there are not that many bridges say up north that is designed to hold 50 tons. true we have combat engineers, but that means for every advance of the mbt, it must wait for the combat engineers to follow up before they can advance furthur. And while the combat engineers are able to carry 50 ton vehicles, the question is how many 50 ton vehicles can it carry at any one time?9if they have to load up one tank and ferry it across a river each time, you are going to waste alot of time. So this is going to be a logistic nightmare.<br><br>so in the end, this is a role of an mbt in sea. It is to support the infantry in an urban assult, or to aid as a force multiplier in an ambush. Light tanks, are best to be used as a form of blitzkreit, to do a very fast and overwhelming strike where the enemy least expect it. And what better ways than to run through the jungle?<br><br>So you have a point in having MBTs. But the thing about replacing the role of a light tank with an MBT is an absolute no no.</div>

Well yeah what you say does makes sense too. In fact what i believe is that tanks in the context of modern warfare, are pretty much sitting ducks. You have a wide array of weapons that could destroy it . Thats why for many of us, whether it is extra armoured or not, with such a wide array of weapons, it doesn't really make much of a difference. On the other hand, tanks are something that you cannot do away with. Without tanks to support your infantry or spearhead an advance your tanks are good as dead.<br><br>so as idwar have said, tanks are most effective when they have the element of surprise. And to do that you require speed and agility. So in other words, a tank is the modern day calvary. To charge, where the enemy least expect create a spearhead within the enemy lines, and let the infantry follow through.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Wow! You guys have a very intensive debate in just one night! Unfortunately, I can't join in. Now to clarify CenturionMBT's doubts. Yes,you are right the armour on the normal SM1 is quite weak,the tank can easily be scrapped by 0.5HMG from our own Ultra M113 or BX.<br><br>You are also right when you said that additional armour can be bolted on,but this is only during war time. I have heard that we have a stand-by force of 'brand new' tanks with the additional armour in storage. Never been used much,they are only activated prior to war. I supposed thats where the bulk of the 350 tanks are,but i can't confirm this though. Could be just rumour but sounds realistic to me.<br><br>Yes,the SM1 cannot fire on the move. We can only shoot and scoot. We can't directly charged at the enemy who have MBT.This is due to the lack of stabilised turret,small calibre ammo and limited armour.We are taught that if we can't kill a MBT with 2 FS rounds then its time to scoot.<br><br>The SM1's role is to act as a fire support platform to the Ultras and BX. We will cover them while they proceed or charge up the objective. We also lead the way in the ABG(Armour Battle Group). As for the reason i am not very sure but i think it is due to the fact that we have the biggest gun and the least no. of crew. So we are more likely to kill the enemy before they can kill us and should we get hit, the max casualties we have is only 3. A relatively unknown function of the SM1 is to provide air cover especially against helicopters(planes are too fast). This is possible due to the odd looking turret which enables it to elevated to a high angle.It is also this turret which help us to shoot behind cover for shoot and scoot due to the low depression angle.Hope that my info is of help. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"></div>
