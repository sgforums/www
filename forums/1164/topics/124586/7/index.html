            <div class='col-md body'>If I am not wrong, the replacement for the SM1 is already ready! Reason why I said this is because the SAF having a tradition of revealing sensitive equipment or units only after they turn operational. For example the BX is only revealed after it have been tested by the 42 SAR. I think this is a good idea as this will keep our potential enemies' intelligence people guessing till the last minute. This way they can also to be absolutely sure that it is working properly before people know about it. Imagine the much touted new equipment which you just revealed ran into techical difficulties just a few months later...a PR disaster! Not very good for deterrance,i supposed.
