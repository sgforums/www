            <div class='col-md body'>but ho compared the training ahh.. when in camp.. always compared here and there,, we look at troopers after cleaning the weapons they can sleep liao, whereas for tankees ard 12 people have to wash vechicles and send in abt 8 pairs of coxials, 12 pairs of carbines.  Good thing is that we are always in vehicle no need to walk unlike troopers..<br><br>But true ah,, this is a f***** up tank.. tell you a secret ah.. if you tighten up the track  tension too much and chiong at the area full of big stones. it will throw track. good if one side only bad is both sides. then enemy will attack you...  nevertheless,, i must say that the tankees are elite force in armour formation</div>

What?<br><br>You mean there is no mud in Europe or other parts of the world? You mean it doesn't rain in Europe. It rains heavily even in the desert.<br><br>Why do you think they invented tanks IN THE FIRST PLACE? It is to counter the muddy condition of the shell cratered battlefield.<br><br>C'mon, stop talking co.ck. If our terrain is so bad then all our bulldozers at construction sites would have bogged down.<br><br>Just because the AMX-13 is small does mean it is better at traversing soft grounds than a bigger tank. Wide tracks would solve that problem. And on a larger tank, you can have wider tracks to distribute the ground pressure you dumbfcuk.<br><br>Next time you want to have a sensible discussion don't begin with a pointed statement directed at me.<br><br>You are one of those idiots who state no opinions of your own but wait for someone to make one and then swoop in with personal attacks.</div></blockquote>Talk about construction site, you think a bull dozer just go in like that !!! all construction is prepared one, if not why loads and loads of stone and sands by lorries is send to each site. You think construction uncle so stupid like you soft ground also dive in without preparing it.<br><br>You dumbfuck even tracked, the weight can be distributed, not no weight, even distributed the weight is only discounted only, but still heavy enough to sink in the ground.<br><br>I am from the combat engineer, I did all sort of vehicle recovery before in all exercise area, therefore I know, even your so call fucking bulldozer I also recover before as I sure you never even seen a 1/2 sink bulldozer.<br><br>Just because amx-13 is small, light armour, 75mm canon, does not mean it is no use !!! Why must put it that we should have only MBT and throw away the light tanks. Why cannot we have both MBT &amp; light tanks which is what we needed.<br><br>The terrain around does call for both, with urban MBT will surive better, with remote more jungle terrain light tanks will survive better.<br><br>What make the MBTs better then Light tanks like amx-13 is better power, heavy armour, better weapon, but then turn around, these are the weakness also that also make it worst then a light tanks.<br><br>Light tanks, have less amour and weapon, but this make them move rapid deploy, like you can ship them on planes and ships which a MBT is too heavy and too big. Logistic like fuel is very important survival factor, while the MBT may survive better, but it run out of fuel also as fast. Light tanks does have advantage on this as they use totally less fuel.<br><br>It is all depend on how you use their strength and weakness. Basically my point is MBT and light tanks are equally as important as they cover each other weakness, just that you must deploy them to suit their nature.</div>

The way technology goes, it may even be soon, or very skip a step further.<br><br>Have you even consider pushing the 2 man tank concept further. A totally manless light tank, that is man remotely by a remote driver and remote weapon specialist ( gunner for cannon, machine gun and missile) ? Possible will be a light tanks for recon .<br><br></div>
