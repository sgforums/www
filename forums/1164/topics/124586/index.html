This included procurement of F/A-18D Hornet and C-130 Hercules aircrafts from the United States. Malaysia was also the first country in the world to have purchased warplanes from both sides of the cold war, when she also acquired MiG-29N Fulcrum from the USSR. However, budgetary constraints imposed by the 1997 financial crisis slowed military procurement. The recent economic recovery may lead to relaxation of budgetary constraints on the resumption of major weapons purchases. In October 2000 the Defense Minister announced a review of national defense and security policy to bring it up to date. This review will address new security threats that have emerged in the form of low intensity conflicts, such as the kidnapping of Malaysians and foreigners from resort islands located off the East Malaysian state of Sabah.<br><br>Current procurements for the air force include 18 Su-30MKM with a possible additional 10, Augusta Westland A109 light helicopters for the army while AEW&amp;C platforms are being evaluated. No recent news on the offer of Super Hornets by the US.<br><br>The army is getting 48 Twardy PT-91 main battle tanks from Poland. Last major procurement was the Astros MRLS from Brazil.<br><br></div>

These threats ended abruptly when Singapore first paraded the newly acquired tanks.<br><br>The reason was pure and simple, Malaysia at that time did not have tanks yet.<br>The fact that we are not part of Malaysia now, shows that the tanks served their purpose already.

            <div class='col-md body'>Like everyone else, I am perpetually puzzled by SAF's continued lack of interest in the MBT area.<br><br>The AMX-13 is obsolete. Even in the mind of the most optimistic person, surely he must hold the same opinion.<br><br>MAF's Polish tank with the silly name remains a formidable force to be reckoned with.<br><br>Someone mentioned that these days it no longer takes a tank to kill a tank. While true, there's no reason why we shouldn't get some big mother of a tank  going.<br><br>Why not? We can well afford it, after all.<br><br>Furthermore, our AMX-13 offers very poor crew protection. The armour is thin and even after all the add on armour, it'll still offer only weak protection. I'm sure most handheld anti-tank weapon will have no problem killing the AMX-13 and its crew. And tank crews, after all, are more precious than tanks.<br><br>In the 80's when we acquired the huge M-60 series of engineer vehicles, I thought we were going to get the M-60 MBT as well. But good thing we didn't. At least this means we can now go out and buy something fancy.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Well,to be honest,its not the size of the tank that matters these days.I mean,its not like during WW2 or wat where by the mere sight of an approaching tank leaves the troops wetting their pants.These days the troops are thought to fight a thinking battle,and with the aid of technology of anti-tank weapons like our new MATADOR,SPIKE etc..a normal infantry man can take out a tank.Even if the infantry man does not take out the tank himself,he can call for airstrike via A-10s or AH-64 gunships etc.Besides,look at the Americans in the gulf,their almighty M1A2 tanks cannot protect them from the narrow streets where they can be shot at freely by RPGs etc.So it really defeats the purpose.<br><br>Though I'm not reccommending that SAF follow the style of the US and get something like the Stryker,but I would say that it would be most advisable if we have something like that.And at the sametime have Light Tanks and Heavy Tanks.</div>
