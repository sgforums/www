            <div class='col-md body'>SpecOps have given the anti-tank capability of infantry and airforce too much credit. Just because an infantryman can kill a tank doesn't make a tank useless.<br><br>We have swords, spears, arrows, rifles etc that can kill an infantryman for thousands of years, but that never made infantrymen useless.<br><br>Same goes for tanks. In the 90 years that tanks have been around, anti-tank weaons and tactics have kept up. But that never made the tank useless.<br><br>Read this excellent report on the Israeli incursion into Lebanon in 1982 that met fierce Syrian counterattack.<br><br><a href="http://www.acig.org/artman/publish/article_279.shtml" rel="nofollow">http://www.acig.org/artman/publish/article_279.shtml</a><br><br>The tank that survived best was the Merkava. Many peole are aware of the fame of the Merkava but not clear on why it is so famous. It is its survivability in battle because of its armour protection and internal layout. Even when hit, the chance of the crew escaping alive is very high.<br><br>The worrying thing is the part is about the vulnerability of the M113. The losses were so high that they were withdrawn from the fight and the troops had to walk.<br><br>Against all collected wisdom, the US moving heavily into lightweight, lightly armoured wheeled vehicles like Humvee and Stryker.

While true, there's no reason why we shouldn't get some big mother of a tank  going.<br><br>Why not? We can well afford it, after all.<br><br>Furthermore, our AMX-13 offers very poor crew protection. The armour is thin and even after all the add on armour, it'll still offer only weak protection. I'm sure most handheld anti-tank weapon will have no problem killing the AMX-13 and its crew. And tank crews, after all, are more precious than tanks.<br><br>In the 80's when we acquired the huge M-60 series of engineer vehicles, I thought we were going to get the M-60 MBT as well.

At least this means we can now go out and buy something fancy.</div></blockquote>Obvious you are not been around heavy vehicles and tanks and know about the effect of terrains around the region.<br><br>Due to the fact of the weather and terrain around, which is soft and rain often, the ground can be too soft for heavy tanks which will be struck more easy. The amx-13 is a very good tanks, yes it seem that it was outdated by now, however you have too the upgrade being done, with the replace of new and more power diesel engine, also using of the new tanks rounds which have much extra penetration power which the tanks that malaysia buy, it as good as any modern light and middle weight tanks. One thing about the AMX-13, is that it is very accurate in hitting the target if the gunner is well train. Also the light weight make it more mobile which can be transported faster and easier.<br><br>As for your arguement on handheld anti-tank weapon can take out Amx-13, yes even M1A1 also can be taken out easy, is not properly use. That why tanks and AFV alway work together as a team, which AFV and amour troopers are to protect the tanks from other folks infantry and take out the anti-tank weapon before they can fire.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I am responding to schrecklichkeit's post. No,our SM1 are Not to be used in the HDB void decks.If you would notice that the newer HDB flats have void decks which is not possible even for a small car to drive through. You are right about the size of the tank for travelling through something though. They are advantagous for crossing a certain sort of terrain in our friendly Northern neighbours. As for what terrain, go figure it out.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>well based on the aussies experience in the vietnam war, the found that the centurions had extreme difficulties trying to navigate through the jungles. And no, it is not the mud that stop them. It is the foliage. They find it nearly impossible to bash through a jungle. In fact, one centurion tried to roll over a bamboo growth and next moment they discovered that the bamboo fliped the tank upside down. So generally, the aussies use the mbts for ambushes or city assults. So tvdog, if you say that mbts are useful here . . . i will say yes, to a certain extend. Mainly you use them for urban or ambushes. But for jungle warfare, it is hell of a different world. And no when we quote ground pressure, we are not simply parroting. You try to maneuver an m113 into a padi field, it gets stuck immediately. If you don't know the proper way of navigating around the padi field. So imagine a centurion for that matter. And you quote temperate and desert conditions. True, it gets muddy when it rains, but the vegetation down there is nothing compared to the tropical climate. And pal, when you were talking about israel, you were talking about urban warfare. Most of us here are talking about jungle. You can't equate urban to jungle warfare. It is damn easy to move an MBT on nice paved roads. But if you try pusing yourself in vegetation so damn thick together with muddy ground, you are going to be over heated , your tank is going to be over strained and you are going to be hell exhausted.</div>

It is likely the smaller AFVs wil be less likely to be mired.<br><br>As for the experiences of Vietnam, MBTS was statistically less mobile than the lighter and smaller APC as reported.<br><br>Narrow jungle tracks which are "created" by civillian jeeps and logging trucks etc are still frequently found in SEA. Likewise the bridges there might not be able to withstand a 50 tons weight.<br><br>And there are plenty of rubber &amp; palm tree plantations in MY , in which the trees are planted in such way to fully utilised the land which are quite narrow for big MBTs to maneuver.<br><br>During WW2, the Brits thought the armour is useless in MY only for paved road, but in reality, the Japs used light tanks in great effect against the Brits.<br><br>Let me quote an articles abt it:<br><blockquote><br>For the most part, the story of Japanese armored employment in the Pacific<br>war was a dismal tale of small units employed in static or infantry support roles. The Malayan campaign is the one instance in WWII where the<br>Japanese used armor effectively in an exploitation role. The best example<br>from this campaign occurred in the battle of the Slim River on January 7th,<br>1942. Although overlooked by most U.S. Army students of armored warfare,<br>it holds some important lessons in exploitation, improvisation, and junior<br>leader initiative.<br><br>The British defeat in Malaya has been the subject of much misconception, the<br>greatest being that it came about due to the superior jungle fighting ability of<br>the Japanese. In fact, little fighting was done more than a few kilometers from<br>trafficable roads.<br><br>The battle for Malaya was a battle for the maneuver corridors through the Malayan mountains and jungle. These corridors were from 50 meters to several kilometers wide, and were cultivated with rubber tree plantations<br>as well as other agriculture. Towns dotted the main roads and railroads<br>that ran down the length of the corridors. Although certainly lush with<br>vegetation, the corridors could not truly be classified as jungle. Significantly,<br>the rubber plantations had numerous side roads that connected with the main<br>road and allowed parallel trafficability.</blockquote>The Scropion AFVs family started design in the 50s where one of the critera was that it should be able to maneuver in a rubber plantation in MY(MY was still a colony then), that is why they are light and small.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>The scropion AFV was developed by UK.

They use the Merkava to ferry troops into the fight in urban built-up areas. When the Centurion became obsolete they turned those into APCs because they value its very thick armour.

There must be very good reasons why they found the AMX-13 hopeless.<br><br>The most significant proof that SAF does believe in MBT is the fact that we DO have the Centurion MBT - 100 of them.
