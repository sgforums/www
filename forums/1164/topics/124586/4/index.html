Unfortunately, I can't join in. Now to clarify CenturionMBT's doubts. Yes,you are right the armour on the normal SM1 is quite weak,the tank can easily be scrapped by 0.5HMG from our own Ultra M113 or BX.<br><br>You are also right when you said that additional armour can be bolted on,but this is only during war time. I have heard that we have a stand-by force of 'brand new' tanks with the additional armour in storage. Never been used much,they are only activated prior to war. I supposed thats where the bulk of the 350 tanks are,but i can't confirm this though. Could be just rumour but sounds realistic to me.<br><br>Yes,the SM1 cannot fire on the move. We can only shoot and scoot. We can't directly charged at the enemy who have MBT.This is due to the lack of stabilised turret,small calibre ammo and limited armour.We are taught that if we can't kill a MBT with 2 FS rounds then its time to scoot.<br><br>The SM1's role is to act as a fire support platform to the Ultras and BX. We will cover them while they proceed or charge up the objective. We also lead the way in the ABG(Armour Battle Group). As for the reason i am not very sure but i think it is due to the fact that we have the biggest gun and the least no. of crew. So we are more likely to kill the enemy before they can kill us and should we get hit, the max casualties we have is only 3. A relatively unknown function of the SM1 is to provide air cover especially against helicopters(planes are too fast). This is possible due to the odd looking turret which enables it to elevated to a high angle.It is also this turret which help us to shoot behind cover for shoot and scoot due to the low depression angle.Hope that my info is of help. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"> </div></blockquote>anti aircraft using the sm1? i think i rather have a manpad . . . .<br><br>hmm so if that is what you say, we can have things like reactive armour or bolt on applique armour on it.<br><br>Looks kinda odd though.</div>

So speed is not exclusive to small-sized tanks.<br><br>And what's more, a modern MBT can shoot at you while moving. That's agiilty.<br><br>Maybe the AMX13 can perform somersaults around the M1 or tap dance in the rubber plantations, but its armament can't definitely stop an enemy MBT, and its armour can't even protect itself from .5 HMG bullets.<br><br>And the armour protection on most modern MBTs, though not perfect, is better than what you would find on any light tanks, modern or otherwise.<br><br>In the old days a small tank can hide in the tree line and ambush approaching enemy forces. But these days enemy MBTs all have some kind of thermal imaging device and can find you even at night. So armour protection is the only way to go. Being small and hiding is passe.<br><br>So if the AMX13 goes into battle, they stand a good chance of becoming tin coffins. They are definitely not meant for this era.<br><br>If light tanks are the way to go, well then get something well-armed and armoured.

And gary1910 seems to know quite bit about SAF armour.<br><br>My late older brother, bless him, was a vehicle commander of an M113 when I was still in primary school. He was damn proud of his black beret and would tell me a lot about tanks so at a young age I was very interested in armour.<br><br>But I ended up in Infantry... pui chow nua.<br><br>At Sungei Gedong, us poor infantry types would have to suffer the smoke and dust produced by the armoured guys when we have the misfortune of sharing the training area. Even a M113 is very intimidating, they are loud, the ground shakes when they speed past, and  the .5 gun is very intimidating even when firing blanks.<br><br>We were walking along a "road" when an M113 sped past, skid to a halt and the gunner started blasting with the .5 HMG. Very loud and deep, and the huge  empty shell casings fell onto the top of the vehicle making a cling clang sound. Very impressive.<br><br>I'd hate to be in a trench facing an enemy armour attack. Would be a very humbling experience.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>MBTs are good...but I still have my doubts as to their deployment in the current ORBAT. I still think we should invest in research in light tanks.
