Benjamin Cossel, USA<br>Special to American Forces Press Service<br><br>CAMP TAJI, Iraq, Nov. 5, 2004 -- For two AH-64D Apache Longbow pilots, the night of Oct. 16 was just a regular night flying a reconnaissance mission around southern Baghdad. ...<br><br>Four personnel to get out and only two seats in the Apache posed a problem. Self-extraction was a maneuver the pilots had been told about in flight school -- a maneuver considered dangerous enough that no practical application was given, just the verbal "here's how you do it."<br><br>Hanging from every pilot's flight vest is a nylon strap attached to a carabiner. On the outside of the Apache there are handholds bolted on primarily to assist maintenance crews as they work on the birds. But, they also have another purpose -- to be used in the event of a self-extraction. The general idea is for the pilot to wrap a nylon strap through the handholds and then connect the strap to the carabiner. The aircraft then flies off to a safe location with the person attached to the outside of the aircraft. .....</blockquote><img src="http://www.defenselink.mil/news/Nov2004/2004110501d_72.jpg"><br><blockquote>Army Capt Ryan Welch, an AH-64D Apache Longbow pilot, sits strapped to the outside of his helicopter as Army Chief Warrant Officer Justin Taylor looks out from his gunner position inside the aircraft. The two pilots are both with the 1st Battalion, 227th Aviation Regiment, 4th Brigade Combat Team, 1st Cavalry Division, and performed a daring rescue mission Oct. 16 in which Welch strapped himself, as seen here, to his aircraft so one of the injured pilots could sit in his seat. After recovering the pilots, they flew to the nearest combat support hospital. Photo by Cpl.
