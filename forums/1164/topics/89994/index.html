Instead, sensor-equipped battlefield robots could be sent by commanders to find and attack enemy forces first.<br><br>New sensors may also be introduced to allow soldiers to fight better in the dark.<br><br>And the infantryman of the future could wear wrist-mounted keypads, allowing them to exchange information with other units to obtain a fuller picture of developments on the battlefield.<br><br>Several hundred full-time national servicemen and regulars in 3 SIR are now testing new weapons and equipment, assisted by defence engineers from the Defence Science and Technology Agency and defence company Singapore Technologies Engineering.<br><br>The weapons and tactics developed by them will help the infantryman of tomorrow 'see better, sense better, shoot better and survive better on urban battlefields', said Colonel Winston Toh, the commander of a newly-created unit, the 9th Singapore Division/Infantry Formation, yesterday.<br><br>The unit is the result of a merger between the 9th Singapore Division and Headquarters Infantry, and will bring together operational and staff planners.<br><br>This will help the SAF assess what is needed by the army of the future in terms of weapons, battle skills and training.<br><br>The formation of the unit was announced at a parade held at Selarang Camp, in Loyang, yesterday morning to mark Infantry Day - the anniversary of the day the first batch of national servicemen was enlisted into the SAF in 1967.<br><br>Addressing the parade, the Chief of Army, Major-General Desmond Kuek, also announced the formation of a new Infantry Training Institute.<br><br>It will take care of all training needs of infantry soldiers, from basic military training until the end of the NS cycle.<br><br>Maj-Gen Kuek said these changes will strengthen the army's ability to meet post Sept 11 challenges and allow it to tap advances in 'new and emerging technologies'.<br><br>'The army's mission has extended beyond the preparation for conventional conflict to include the need to be responsive and ready to deal with a whole new range of missions in peace such as counter-terrorism, low-intensity conflict and operations other than war.'<br><br>Straits Times 18 August 2004<br><a href="http://straitstimes.asia1.com.sg/topstories/story/0,4386,267662,00.html?" rel="nofollow">http://straitstimes.asia1.com.sg/topstories/story/0,4386,267662,00.html?</a><br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Thats right,I think the Straits Times have published an article on this system before. We in military nuts have discussed on that before as well. The inventor is an ex-Isareli SOF personnel. The system have a variant which can be attached to existing weapons such as pistols. Very useful for FIBUA or hostage crisis. The current procedure for clearing a room is to lob in a SFG or stun grenade. That will attract attention and may hurt or kill unnecessary people such as the hostages. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"></div>
