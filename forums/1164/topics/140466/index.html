            <div class='col-md body'>uhh... actually in the 1970s up to late 80s, the old Changi hospital near Changi village was designated as a SAF hospital. I know, because in the mid 80s I was a PL Sgt and one of my chaps was involved in a motor bike accident just outside camp. The OC let him book out officially and he was in uniform and just unlucky to be hit by a lorry. Because he was in uniform when he was hit and because he had a valid time-off, he was taken straight to the old CGH under SAF charge.  I went to visit him as a sort of welfare thingy.</div>

Sorry wake you up hello welcome back to the real world.  1st every available troops is require to fight in the front line, if they send you to the field hospital, you are already lucky, so don't push your lucky and ask them to space more men just they can bring you further back another 50km more so you can be in civilian hospital which already fill with civilians.  You think army will spare you a vehicle or heli just that you like civilian hospital and doctor more. Don't forget wars also have civilians casulties.<br><br>Also all vehicles is moving forward to the front line, helicopters and everything. Even they spare you a helicopter or vehicle, with every things rushing forward, you think they let you block the advance do you can go there other direction ? You think they clear you a flight path when the sky is so crowded so that you fly backward ?  Next the moment war break out, you think roads are open, most roads are no passable due to abandon or damage vehicles or block by fallen buildings. You think there is any way a vehicle can even reach from battle field to way back hospital ?<br><br>Even if singapore have helicopter, they are troops helicopter 1st then medic helicopter... Even if they are medic helicopter their task is to take you to the nearest field hospital..... and not to civilian hosptial for because they got cuter nurses.</div>
