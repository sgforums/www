They overcome all odds. I salute them for their determination.Its beyond their control to be in such a situation. Those real case handicapped ones.<br><br>SO we must understand that its beyond the intellectual ability of some others in this forum to express their view in a intellectual and sound way, who always give stupidity as a arguement. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"></div>
