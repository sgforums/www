I guess since that they are indirectly supporting the war effort they may not be called up. But as for who to take over their duties in their reservist unit, maybe those units with lots of ST employees and people working for government-linked companies providing support for SAF will be activated the last.<br><br>This question also brings about the problem of other ST employees such as non-NSmen, PR and foreigners. They being civilians working for ST, especially the PRs and foreigners, can we count on their support in times of war? An example will be the aunties,uncles and bangala working for SFI, when war broke out will they carry on working to provide us with hot meals or will they hide in bomb shelters(for locals) and leave home(for foreign workers)?<br><br></div>
