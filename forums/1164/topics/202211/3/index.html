            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote>so what if we have so many soldiers? the SAF and the singaporeans in general are relatively untested in a REAL war. </blockquote>That`s too far-fetched a generalization. Im pleasantly surprised it continues to crop up every now and then. As a matter of fact, not too many professional soldiers have seen real combat. That includes a whole gamut of countries such as France, Germany, Japan, etc. Unless, you`re the US, you don`t send a large proportion of your troops to fight. A few hundred or thousands(extremely rare) do not account for an entire armed forces. Also, combat intensities and circumstances differs. And it`s completely pointless to say your country had the experienced of being in a previous war long ago. The soldiers who took part in it are dead or out of commission. The lessons learnt will generally be the same lessons distilled and learnt by many armed forces all around the world.<br><br>I agree that many countries in SEA would have difficulty in matching our rapid deployment capability.<br><br>Someone mentioned about corruption somewhere. I would like to make the point that it is inherently dangerous to have an armed forces plagued by corruption and go to war. It impedes progress in times of peace. It will impede goals in times of war. That`s self-defeating especially if an enemy knows where and how to exploit; perhaps even before the first shot is fired.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I remember a number being quoted 10 years ago - in Defending the Lion City, if I'm not wrong - at 350,000 including reservists for SAF. Of course, how Tim Huxley obtained this figure is anybody's guess.<br><br>So with our dwindling birth rate, it is not surprising that 10 years later, our strength is down to 280, 000.<br><br>Another alarming figure oft quoted is that only 40% of any standing modern army are actual frontline combat troops. The other 60% is logistics and other non-combat personnel.<br><br>So if we go by 40% of 280,000, this = 112,000 frontline combat troops.<br><br>Let's say within this 112,000 combat troops 50% are infantrymen. Then this means we have 56,000 infantrymen in SAF.<br><br>(The other 50% of combat troops are combat personnel in Armoured, Arty, Navy, Airforce, SADA etc)<br><br>If there are 400 people in an infantry battalion, then it means we have around 140 infantry battalions (or 46 brigades, or 15 divisions).<br><br>And within these 140 battalions, about half will be older units comprised of men over 30 and understrength due to attrition of age etc.<br><br>So we'll have around 70 useful battalions, and 70 "Dad's Army" 2nd line battalions.<br><br>Maths is fun!!!<br><br>I'm sure these calculations are hoplessly inaccurate, just for a laugh... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"></div>

On a serious note, training is the key. Another is money. A lot of soldiers fighting in the streets of Lebanon and Iraq are city-bred.

The Greeks had the phalanx, the British had thier neat navy ships, the Americans had the peerless carrier battle groups, etc. You can also say these are force multipliers which enable you to do things your enemy can`t with the same number of troops. Of course, if you`re staying in a country which can`t afford all these, you really need to find some reasons to make sense of the gap in capability. Otherwise, `malu' you know.</div>
