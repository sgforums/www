            <div class='col-md body'>From a MINDEF article (the PTI course is conducted after the conclusion of the SISPEC course):<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">The trainees for the Basic Fitness Specialist Course are drawn from among the fittest combat specialists to pass out from the School of Infantry Specialists (SISPEC). Fitness Specialist trainees must have passed their Individual Physical Proficiency Test (IPPT) and Standard Obstacle Course (SOC).<br><br>They are then put through intensive physical training to shape them into models of physical fitness.<br><br>The highlight of the course is the Combat Physical Fitness Test that each trainee must complete within 52 minutes to qualify as a Fitness Specialist. It consists of:<br><br>A 150m swim with a rifle in No. 4 (camouflage) uniform;<br>A 'combat jump' from a three-metre springboard/platform followed by a further 50m of swimming;<br>A 1.5km run in Full Battle Order (which includes rifle, helmet, webbing and full pack) to the SOC;<br>Clearing of the SOC's 11 obstacles in Full Battle Order;<br>A final 3.5km run to the finish line.<br>In addition, Fitness Specialists are trained to be proficient instructors and supervisors for swimming, weights training in the gym, various sports and games, and basic physical training lessons. They are trained to lead both by instruction and example.</span><br>-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br><br>It's generally a good life for NSF PTIs; I'm hearing you can even be attached out of the SAF to local schools now. But there's a catch; it's back to being infantry riflemen as NSmen, when the (experienced) soldier-peng tends to view you with very-prejudiced eyes then. Expect to eat plenty of crow then ...</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I was a ex-PTI some years back...I'm ain't sure if they revamp anything but here it goes....<br><br><strong>Selection:</strong><br><br>Before PTI course, we'll have to go through SISPEC (Section Leader course). In SISPEC we were told our batch is to go through the PTI selection. Anyway, that time, PTI course was run I think twice yearly. So our SISPEC batch was the 'lucky' ones.<br><br>During the selection, those interested in the PTI course were told to swim 100m (2 laps)- 50m of b_r_e_a_s_t stroke and 50m of free style would be an advantage, else any style could do also (I think). What they are looking is not how fast you swim but whether your strokes are correct and whether you can glide.<br><br>After the swim, if you are ok, they'll interview you immediately once you get out of the pool...I can't remember the questions though..They do look at your IPPT as well during the interview. But you do not have to get Gold to be selected. Silver and above preferable, I think.<br><br><strong>Course:</strong><br><br>The course was fun (and I really mean it). It lasts approx. 3 months. We get to train with people from other Uniform Groups- which I'm not sure if I can name them...but they are the elites.<br><br>It wasn't as tough as what a lot of people thought. The main reason is they train our fitness level up progressively. For example the first run might be 3km, then to 5km then to 7km...etc etc.<br><br>We were also taught the physics of human body and anatomy. Things like how to train overwight pple, how to conduct gym lessons etc etc were really fun. We were also taught how to conduct rappelling classes.<br><br>Games were plenty in SPT (school of physical training). We have evening games like indoor tennis, basketball, boxing and soccer. We are not trained in martial arts though. We organised trainee-trainer football and such....<br><br>If I remembered correctly, the record for chin ups that time was 30plus and 2.4km was about 6mins or less than that.<br><br><strong>Graduation:</strong><br>To pass the course we only have to pass 2 test: life-guard test and modified SOC test.<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Life guard test:</span><br>We have lifeguard course nearly every afternoon (hence the selection). In the course we were taught basic water survival techniques and how to be defensive in water when rescuing the victim. Did CPR training as well.<br><br>In the test we were supposed to swim 1 lap to the 'victim' who is in SBO and 2 water bottles full. Tow him back 1 lap. Will consider failed if any water splases on the victims face. All this should be done within 3 mins.<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Modified SOC test</span><br>Clock starts.<br>First we have to swim 3 laps in long fall and dummy rifle without boots. Then go up to the diving board and jump down before swimming the last lap.<br><br>Get out of the pool, wear boots. Put on SBO with 2 bottles full of water. Put on FBO as well. Helmet and dummy rifile on and continue to run 2km to reach SOC point.<br><br>Clear SOC which is the toughest...with your wet attire and FBO, believe me...its not fun at all....Finish SOC, run another 3km to the finishing point. Clock stops. If you manage to clear within 50 mins then u pass....else...I'm not sure.<br><br>But worry not, we did this modified SOC not less than 5 times before the actual test.... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink">  so should have enough training. Timming was logged everytime. And of course we have to improve our timmings progressively. On top of this, we have to clear SOC nearly every 2-3 days with just FBO (i.e. without the 5km run).<br><br>I hope this does not put off prospective PTIs...as I said, the training plan is in such good shape that you are trained progressively and will not feel anything at all...maybe the first 2 weeks muscle aches...thats about all.<br></div>
