It needs ppl to lead by example, to follow the tough orders and to be able (God willing) after several years of following rather slavishly - give orders.<br><br>You need the "Air level" because the technical ability to lay a 155mm barrage cannot to trusted to a 'tikam tikam' intellect. Not to say that the brightest cannot make an error and make a "3625 mils" as "3652 mils" "fire for effect" order (FYI its called a transposition error).<br><br>My units' signal platoon has first class engineers in civi street, some CEO potential, some head engineers in multi-million dollar technical positions. They are all Corporals, not because they are dumb. They can think but because of their physical fitness (all PES B), end up as linesman and radio operators, what more they are more technically savy than their PC.<br><br>Officers are trained to accept painful orders and ensure that it is carried out (without question and without hesitation). That is drummed into them during OCS and for the first two years of service or when they reach captain. Because an officer is only as good as his ability to receive and give orders.<br><br>What drives the men are the NCOs. The backbone of the armed forces. Ask any scout, pioneer or commando. Seldom do these elements operate as a platoon (the smallest size where you'd expect to see an officer). There basic leadership is practiced hands on, from the ground up. You don't need an "Air level" to become an NCO. However good NCOs seldom, if ever become, good officers (extremely few exceptions).<br><br>I am the first to admit that LTC above (Battlion), another form of leadership needs to be seen (see Colin Powell). However we should never forget the "Lions led by Donkeys" war (the Great War a.k.a. WW I) when all the generals could do was to reinforce failure at a very high cost in blood. e.g. July 1, 1916, the British lost some 56,000+ men in 24 hours, thats all our active SAF (not counting NSMen).<br><br>What I hope we never have to test or learn the hard way whether we are right in the way we select our leaders and how well we prepare them.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Israel has a different method of identifying leaders during their NS. All Israelis enter BMT as equals. They pass out and go into different units for their vocation training. After a year in service, the good ones are identified and sent to the NCO course. The very best are sent to officer cadet school. Selection is based not only on education, but on soldiering skills and performance as well. When they passed out as NCOs or officers, they return to their units or join new intakes. Males will serve 3 years, females 2 years. In short they prove themselves as soldiers first, before being NCOs or officers.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>If I may bring an extra variable into this topic discussion: the SAF scholar.<br><br>For the most part, I think all OCS-trained officers are fine, or at least the ones I've worked with as part of an operational unit. There's always an initial easing-in period as they find their niches, trying to a right balance between "pulling rank" per se (aka chickensh!t in US parlance) on one extreme &amp; Pasir Laba-style can-do collective team spirit on the other. [It's another story with the couple of 2LTs from each batch who tend to wear their ego like their rank.]<br><br>For the rest of the NSF stint, they tend to play 2nd-fiddle to the regular OC/CSM's or equivalent, but IMO this system works cuz they settle in very well upon taking full control come reservist time (with their maturity as well as the overall unit's).<br><br>Well, from my experience anyway &amp; from the ancedotes I hear.<br><br>More to the point: I did my NS during a time when the "2nd-generation " of SAF scholars, i.e. those in the '80s, was fast-tracked into their training/appointments &amp; I can honestly say they provided for a fluctuating quality of leaders then. Without naming names, I served under 3 of them (one a CO) &amp; Lee Hsien Loong's pioneer influence was still lingering throughout the formation. I'm sure they'll all brilliant students &amp; worthy OCS cadets, but the sense of entitlement one of them displayed was a huge turn-off.<br><br>On the one hand, we Hokkien pengs knew they were high-fliers who's essentially climbing on our backs &amp; that they'll definately be promoted no matter how they led us. On the other, it can be a very alienating experience having to follow &amp; tolerate a megalomaniac's "leadership" - even our 2LTs &amp; experienced sergeant major were pissed off with him.<br><br>I dunno if the selection process got better since the '90s, but here's hoping they've weeded out the conceit trait since then.</div>

From what I gathered, enlistees, specialists &amp; WOs, most of them are brilliant staff officers but many doubt they can be as efficient on the battle-field. I had the pleasure of knowing a fair lot of officers which I feel have very good leadership qualities and would have their men proud to serve under them. They were able to inspire their men and push them to accomplish what they thought was impossible, yet still maintain a healthy standard of welfare for them.<br><br>Depends on how you see it, some soldiers only think of themselves and cannot get out of their civilian mentalities. These people will still brand any officers who don't give them the welfare they seek as lousy or bad, they never see the bigger picture: There is no "I" in TEAM.</div></blockquote>this are the people who serve with a grudge..the less of them the better..but in this present manpower state..we have to tahan them..<br>n there are getting more n more of this people...it is the society that create this attitude...it will get worst..<br><br>ive know of Spec n men who serve unwillingly but do their best in watever they do..they will kpkb n their hand will still move n their legs will still run..<br><br></div>
