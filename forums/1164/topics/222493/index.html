            <div class='col-md body'>I was reading a book on the engagement during Desert Storm before the Coalition ground forces move into Kuwait and Iraq.<br><br>Three Iraqi Divisions moved into Saudi Arabia. There was a story of an engagement of TOW and 25mm Marine Corps LAVs against Iraqi T-62 and T-55.<br><br>typically the MC SOP is to standoff and engage enemy with TOWs. Howeve due to nature of the ground and the need to cover the extraction of recon teams, they are forced to approach at short range and engage tanks with 25mm rounds.<br><br>The 25mm rounds are bouncing off the armour of the Iraqi tanks. Just imagine if it is the AMX-13, Our tank crews will be sacrificed in vain. 25mm rounds will probably go right through the turret.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Yeah my friend bought it by blue-on-blue during ATEC, by his own OC no less.<br><br>I've heard cases of Bradleys managing to knock out T-72s with their 25mm cannon, though I wonder if it is really possible. A sustained barrage of 25mm might cause the crew within to bail (esp. given the notorious quality of Iraqi tanker) as the noise and shock from the barrage might make them think that the tank has taken all it can take. In WW2 this Sherman tank crew "knocked out" two Tigers by using WP shells on them. While causing no damage the smoke from the shells were sucked into the tank convincing the crews that the tank was on fire and they bailed! Too bad that Sherman was knocked out soon after.<br><br>Another theory is that while the frontal armor of the T-72 is good, there are several weak spots where the 25mm can find, and a barrage of 25mm is sure of foul any optics and the like on the MBT, so it can be quite useful. A flank shot or rear might have a fair chance of taking the tank out, so that is possible as well.</div>
