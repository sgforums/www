            <div class='col-md body'>Hi forumnites,  a recent and strange allegation that the heavy downwash from a Chinook helicopter can set off landmines exploding.<br><br><strong>The Ministry of Defence has said that there was no evidence to support claims that a landmine blast which killed a Para corporal in Afghanistan was caused by the downdraft from an RAF helicopter.<br><br>The Sun newspaper reported that the twin-rotor Chinook sent to rescue Cpl Mark Wright and his 3 Para patrol after they became stranded in a minefield earlier this month set off at least two explosions.<br><br>According to the paper, Cpl Wright had specified that a smaller helicopter should be sent when he radioed for help, but his request was ignored.<br><br>Following the incident, in which five other paras were injured - three losing legs, Cpl Wright's commanding officer said he had died trying to save a comrade who had been injured in an earlier blast.<br><br>The Sun quoted a member of the Para patrol as telling comrades: "Mark radioed the ops room but specified they must not send in a Chinook.<br><br>"Their downdraft is massive and anyone with any RAF experience knows they would be liable to set off mines as they hover."<br><br>The Para said that the Chinook was forced to leave empty after setting off at least two mines.<br><br>The patrol was eventually rescued by a smaller US Army Blackhawk helicopter but Cpl Wright died of his injuries on the aircraft.<br><br>The MoD however insisted that there was nothing to support the soldier's claims and criticised his decision to speak out publicly.<br><br>The latest controversy follows the disclosure of e-mails from a major in the Paras complaining that the RAF in Afghanistan had been "utterly, utterly useless".</strong></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>1 - Its 'The Sun'. Not exactly a paragon of integrity and objectivity<br><br>2 - having said that it is plausible that the downwash might set off mines - either due to the force of the downwash, or due to the debris flying around. After all the Cpl specifically asked for a smaller helicopter rather than a chinook - this implies that they have experience of that happening.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Yes, tend to agree that the downwash itself may not create enough ground pressure on the landmine or anti-personnel mine to trigger it.<br><br>It could be that the downwash lifted some large stones and flung them down on the mine.  This could create sufficient impulse to trigger the anti-personnel mine ( which is the more likely type of mine).<br><br>And yes, the SUN is a sensationalist newspaper. They were capitalising on a recent article that a major in the British Paras had leaked an email criticising the RAF.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Wrong chap. The guy who got a VC ( the highest decoration) is a private with a Mechanised Infantry batalion. He was driving a Warrior IFV in Iraq not Afghanistan. He was promoted last week to Lance Corporal but he is still on sick leave as he was injured.<br><br>The CPL here is serving with the Paras in Afghanistan.<br><br>I do not agree with the assessment that because he was a CPL, someone let him down.  If you understand batalion ops, the patrol leader calls into the Bn ops net. And very likely you speak to the duty Ops officer or NCO or signaller at that time.  They may rank above you but they are part of your unit. Soldiers will try to look after their own.<br><br>It is very likely that the batalion did relay the request of the patrol to the Air Tasking Cell ( which is usually a joint army and air force manned section). Air Tasking may have denied the request . For the RAF, they are very short of helicopters, so they may have had no choice but to send a Chinook.</div>
