              <p>Not true. Singapore is same situation as Israel. Both are security participants in the F-35 project. So they'd both be able to buy F-35. And get ur facts right, the Gripen is not more powerful than F-15. It all depends on what aspects u are comparing. U compare thrust power? Firepower? Manoevrability? Payload? The F-15 SG is good, otherwise u think RSAF will take Gripen off its selection so early? Gripen is good in its own rights, but then it doesnt fit Singapore requirements.</p>

              <p>Do your research before you speak.</p>
              <p>The JAS-39 Gripen claims they're the first 4th-generation fighter to be operational...but look at the facts...they're 4th-gen because of the year it was built, not in terms of technology.</p>
              <p>Just take a look why nobody who can afford a F-16 will opt for a JAS-39? JAS-39 only picked up by third world countries who can't afford F-16.</p>
              <p>AND the F-15 is better than the F-16, so basic human intelligence will you, both F-15 and F-16 beats the JAS-39.</p>
              <p>And i'm not bullshitting, just look at how much payload the JAS-39 can take vs the F-15 and F-16, what kinda radar it can take, and what is the effective combat range? And weapon compatibility...u'll realise the Gripen is like a poor man's F-16 or a bigger F-5.</p>
              <p>Once again, you look at what RSAF has been doing these days. They are getting F-16/52+, with CFT for long-range strike, and they bought F-15SG for EVEN LONGER range strike + even better beyond-visual-range air-to-air.</p>
              <p>Gripen? Oh please....</p>

              <p>To add on a little, I'm not saying Gripen is crap. It was designed by Sweden for Swedish's defence needs, and its capable for that.</p>

              <p>Looks like a simplistic way of looking at things, there's more to air combat then all that.</p>
              <p>Firstly for that all to work, it makes the assumption that the Gripen will not be detected, and will detect the F-15 within the engagement range of its missiles. All this does not work and comes to naught if they can detect you long out of range of your missiles.</p>
              <p>Unfortunately unless the Gripen has a really small RCS like the F-22, low-observability is less of a tactic, and more of a signature-management issue. There is a big difference between the no.4 camo uniform and the sniper gillie suit. </p>
              <p>Worse, all this functions under the assumption that the F-15s are working alone and not under the cover of an AWACS or ground radar. Air forces do not just go to war with planes flying piecemeal against each other, tactics and how you play your cards is probably more crucial to victory.</p>
              <p>All in all I seriously, seriously doubt any Gripen pilot's main idea to victory is to get in a shot a few seconds ahead of the an enemy pilot. Not to mention all the issues about firing at extreme range and the low PKs that come with it.</p>

              <p>Ultimately I believe there's one thing to consider before arguing too much.</p>
              <p>If some person claims that their "technology" can do rhings better then some other similar and more reconized piece, but yet is sold at a lower price and has not found many takers... I would take a lot of their claims with a pinch of salt.</p>

              <p>My wifi is faster thank Link16, by 54 times!</p>
              <p>F-22 is using technology beyond that already lar.</p>
              <p>Another thing is security. The F-22 another more secure system called the Intra-Flight Data-Link (IFDL). As a "Stealth" fighter, it can sometimes be operating in areas the enemy do not expect it to be. Conventional datalink such as the Link16 can be detected / intercepted by enemy SIGINT. Sad to say, the F-22 / F-35 cannot share its wealth of info with other F-16 or F-15 using conventional means. But there are the ways to move information around.</p>
              <p>Besides, I think the link-16 might not be able to support the sheer amount of data that can be generated.</p>

              <p>None.</p>
              <p>Also the your whole point on smaller RCS shoot missiles first for the JAS39 is already rather suspect, you've not brought up any other real arguments since when.</p>
              <p>I find your intellectual intergity and honesty in here rather suspect... ie. using lionnoisy style arguments, just with better english.</p>

              </blockquote>
              <p>Are you forgetting long loiter time for patrol or the ability to hit vital targets out deep into enemy turf? All these things are options that the JAS39 does not offer the RSAF.</p>
              <p>Unless your idea of the RSAF is the kind of airforce whoes main idea is to scramble and knife-fight over Singapore this point is so paper-thin and simplistic that I am surprised you even tried to suggest it and think it'll slip by.</p>

              <p>Far distance is a must  - as the enemy may be a large country - which need the extra legs to reach some of the target. Also you will need loitering - to attack some targets. You cannot invest in a short leg fighter - and which need to be everytime supported by tankers. <br><br>JAS39 may be smaller in radar , but F15 radar is more powerful - in the end - F-15 still detect and shoot 1st then JAS39.</p>

              <p>This is clutching at straws here, just because you say insist something will be this way does not mean it is. Given all the facts that we have and know, what you say is simply false.</p>
              <p>Also you are using vauge terms, how much is "much bigger"? or how very is very "very likely"? They seem to me to be terms used to justify wishful thinking rather then facts.</p>
              <p>Firstly how much smaller on radar is the JAS 39 RCS? Note that RCS is more of a function of plane shape design then physical size, the B2 is way bigger then the Gripen but it has a much, much smaller RCS.</p>
              <p>Also, AFAIK, if you are talking about a stealth aircraft, the Gripen is NOT it. An example of a stealth aircraft would be the F-22, the JSF, the B2 and what have you not. Even the signature-managed Rafale is a much better example then the Gripen. Trying to say that the Gripen can spring up on its foes like the F-22 is patently not talking with much common sense, it's like saying a house cat can take on a zebra like a lion because they are both cats.</p>
              <p>Talk aside, let's go to the facts. </p>
              <p>How long can the Gripen hide from the extremely powerful APG-63(V)3 radar of the F-15? How long can it hide from the even more powerful radars of AWACS that are being used? The truth is all things considered, unless it is some aircraft like the F-22 or JSF all these things about smaller RCS is utterly moot. The F-15SG will see the Gripen long before it can even come in range of its missiles.</p>
              <p>This whole thing about seeing a few seconds before and getting shots off at extreme range is pretty much rubbish unless you are flying an F-22 or JSF, and it certianly does not apply to a budget lighweight fighter designed with modest abilites.</p>
