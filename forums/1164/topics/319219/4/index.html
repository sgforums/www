              <p>I wonder what's next, display name is going to argue for the supremacy of the Gripen over the F-22?</p>
              <p>I notice that he only has one point that he keeps harping on the Gripen in that it is better then the F-15SG, and that is RCS, which is not even as great as advantage as he makes it to be... in fact given the powerful radar of the F-15 and the RSAF's utilization of AWACS it is moot.</p>
              <p>The funny thing is, things that REALLY matter like performance, endurance, payload are glossed over and avoided by him.</p>
              <p>What a true lionnoisy-style performance. Is he going to argue that the Gripen is smaller so you can "fly for your life" with one engine?</p>

              <p>Ever since lionnoisy, this forum has very little tolerance for the like-a-piece-of-equipment-and-hence-argue-for-it-illogically behaviour.</p>
              <p>You like the Gripen? Nobody's going to fault you for that, just don't try to justify your liking by resorting to doing silly things like claiming it has Gundam capabilities or something like that.</p>
              <p>I might as well say that I like a 2B pencil better then an F-22, the 2B pencil has a smaller RCS and in war all we need to do is to throw it into the intake or use it to stab the pilot in order to bring the F-22 down. See! The RSAF should buy more 2B pencils then aircraft!</p>

              Comparing specs of one plane to another makes no sense. 
              
              Even with AWACS ,electronic warfare assets &amp; total air supremacy, US F15C pilots needed to muster all their skills to bring down Iraqi MIG 23s, 29s &amp; Mirage F1s in air to air  combat. 
              
              You may have a good plane, but more importantly , you need a very good pilot.

              The numbers don't tell you everything. It still took skill,  experience &amp; determination on the part of the US pilots in Gulf War 1 to knock out Iraqi MIGs and Mirages out of the sky even though most were running away from the fight.  
              
              The MIG 29s were good, but without good &amp; agressive piloting, poor SA and almost non existent GCI on the Iraqi side. Basically, they ran &amp; did not try to fight.    
              
              The F15 record for 101 to 0 kills are for the F15C version. 
              Are there any kills from F15 Ds or Es ?      
              In all cases, the F15s had overwelming air superiority with AWACs and electronic warefare aircraft vectoring them to their targets. Had US pilots used MIG 29s instead of F15s in this same situation, what do you think the outcome will be ?
