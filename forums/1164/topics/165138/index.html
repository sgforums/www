            <div class='col-md body'>SEOUL, South Korea Jun 21, 2005 Â— A deadly rampage by an army conscript guarding the last Cold War fronter is heightening concerns about discipline in the South Korean military and its ability to defend the country against the communist North.<br><br>There already were worries because of recent lapses in security along the Demilitarized Zone, which has divided the peninusla since a cease-fire halted the Korean War in 1953 but left the two nations facing off across one of the world's most heavily armed borders.<br><br>Two years of military service is compulsory for South Korean men, and the army is notorious for mistreatment of conscripts. After a trooper killed eight fellow soldiers Sunday, the Defense Ministry admitted a culture of harassment permeates the military, and President Roh Moo-hyun called for a review of discipline.<br><br>Suicide Bombing Leaves 30 Dead in Iraq<br>Give Thanks to America's 'Nemesis': Cheap Oil for America's Poor<br>International Perspective<br><br>Pfc. Kim Dong-min, 22, described by investigators as a timid computer-game fan, reportedly was angered by taunts from an officer. He allegedly threw a grenade into a barracks full of sleeping soldiers and fired dozens of shots at officers.<br><br>The same day, two other conscripts committed suicide while on duty, apparently due to the pressures of their service.<br><br>One hanged himself with his shoelaces, and his family said he had written in a diary that he was embarrassed at being beaten in front of other soldiers and feared further abuse. Another private set himself on fire.<br><br>The three incidents added to concerns about military efficiency following recent stumbles in keeping the border secure.<br><br>Just last week, a man who apparently was a North Korean soldier was found wandering around south of the DMZ seeking to defect. In April, the North returned a fisherman whose boat drifted across the sea border while he was drunk after the South's navy failed to force him to turn back.<br><br>"The fact that these things happen one after another shows that there are huge faults and problems with the military discipline and security conditions," said Park Geun-hye, leader of the main opposition Grand National Party, which called Tuesday for the defense minister's resignation.<br></div>
