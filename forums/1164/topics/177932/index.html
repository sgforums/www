            <div class='col-md body'>Terrorism cannot be fought with terrorism. It will backfire. Even the states that sponsored terrorism is facing the heat of terrorism.<br><br>Kandahar hijacking, 9/11 Â‘linkedÂ’<br>[URL=http://www.tribuneindia.com/2006/20060327/main2.htm]LINK[/URL]<br><br>New Delhi, March 26<br>Fresh evidence has surfaced suggesting that the December 24, 1999, hijacking of Indian Airlines flight IC 814 was a progenitor of unprecedented terrorist attack on the American mainland (9/11). Two terrorist incidents Â— one in India and the other in the USA Â— are closely interconnected as without the hijacking of IC 814 in 1999, 9/11 possibly could not have taken place.<br><br>Ahmed Omar Saeed Sheikh, one of the three terrorists who were taken to Kandahar for release by the then External Affairs Minister Jaswant Singh, was one of the key planners and perpetrators of the most daring terrorist attempt on the US soil, said a former military intelligence analyst John Newman during his testimony before the 9/11 inquiry commission.<br><br>Newman went on to say that Â“Saeed Sheikh was probably a triple agentÂ” who operated for Pakistani, American and British intelligence while being an Al-QaidaÂ’s top functionary. After his release in 1999, Ahmad Omar Saeed Sheikh, a British national of Pakistani origin, was appointed member of the Majlis Al-Shura by Osama Bin Laden, said the testimony, which did not find mention in the final report on 9/11.<br><br>Despite startling revelations about IslamabadÂ’s involvement in the 9/11 by Newman, the military government of General Pervez Musharraf succeeded in getting vital information removed from the final report.<br><br>Bin Laden referred to Sheikh as his son. No attempt was made to arrest when he returned to Pakistan from Kandahar where he was set free in exchange of Indian hostages in IC 814 episode.<br><br>The ISI gave him a house and protection from the police. He lived openly and frequented swanky parties attended by senior government officials, observed Newman adding that the US government sources told Newsweek that he was a Â“protected assetÂ” of the ISI.<br><br>Sheikh, who carried many names, including Mustafa Ahmed, Mustafa Shmed al-Hasawi, Mustafa Mahmoud Saeed Ahmed, Mustafa Mohammed Ahmed, is a hijacking, kidnapping and financial expert. He was tasked with killing Daniel Pearl and is understood to have funded 9/11 by wiring $100,000 to Mohammed Atta.<br><br>Sheikh, the man about whom the Commission of Inquiry report utters no word, overhauled Al-QaidaÂ’s logistics, communications and financial networks and was given responsibilities in international liaisons such as relations with the Hezbollah or the Sudanese National Islamic Front.<br><br>To facilitate financial and communications needs, he designed a new secure, encrypted, web-based communications system for Al-Qaida. There was talk that he would someday succeed Bin Laden. Over and above all these responsibilities, Sheikh had another extremely sensitive job for Al-Qaida.<br><br>He was the groupÂ’s principal liaison with the ISI. He worked closely with various current and former officers of Pakistani intelligence, including Lieut-General Mohammed Aziz Khan, who along with President Pervez Musharraf himself, was the most powerful commander in Pakistan.<br><br>A product of the London School of Economics, he went on to play a vital role in 9/11 by financing the hijackers. For his trouble, he received the same impersonal budget as the two other key coordinators, Khalid Sheikh Mohammed and Ramzi bin Al-Shibh.<br><br>As the 9/11 attacks neared, ISI chief General Ahmed became more deeply mired in the plot, apparently to secure new sources of funds for the airline tickets needed for the reconnaissance flights on the date of the attack.<br><br>In early August, SheikhÂ’s former prison mates kidnapped a wealthy shoe tycoon in India and held him for 15 days. Chief gangster Ansari ran the operation from Dubai in the Arab Emirates. Sheikh was carrying out his 9/11 paymaster duties. The kidnappers freed their hostage for $ 830,000 and gave $ 100,000 to Sheikh.<br><br>In an email discovered afterwards, Ansari said: Â“IÂ’ve paid $ 100,000 to Sheikh,Â” said Newman in his testimony.<br><br>On the orders of the ISI chief, Sheikh wired the money to hijack leader Mohammad Atta. Flush with money, Atta Hamzi and Hanzour flew first class on the type of aircraft they would use on September 11, 2001.<br><br>All this does not find mention in the commission report because both the USA and the British governments were keen to enlist Pakistan as a key ally in their attack on Afghanistan.<br><br>Recent revelations in the Pakistani media have confirmed that Islamabad had paid tens of thousand dollars to lobbyists in the USA to get anti-Pakistan references dropped from the 9/11 report.<br><br>In 1993, he got hooked up with Pakistani terrorist in Bosnia to take up Â“jehadÂ” and got training in terror camps in Afghanistan. In 1994, he tried to get a terrorist leader freed from an Indian jail by luring an American and three Britons to locations where they were kidnapped but the plot failed and he ended up in jail instead. The hostages were rescued.<br><br>The ISI paid for his lawyer, but he was never tried during his 5 years of incarceration. Despite his kidnapping of British citizens, he was allowed to immediately travel to London. There were no indictments either in India, the UK or the USA.<br><br>On January 2, 2000, the British Foreign Office spokesman would only say that this was so because he was a British citizen and had not been convicted of any offences overseas.<br><br>Islamist cell 'tried to con young men into attacks on the UK'<br>[URL=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/newspaper/0,,171-2106395,00.html]LINK[/URL]<br><br>ISLAMIST terrorists wanted to trick young Muslims into attacking Britain, by training them to fight in Afghanistan for al-Qaeda and then telling them that the country was inaccessible, the Old Bailey was told yesterday.<br><br>The British extremists allegedly intended to set up a private terrorist training camp in Pakistan, teaching hijacking and use of explosives and firearms. One also discussed poisoning water supplies with ricin. Another said that Britain needed to be targeted in the same way as America had been in the September 11 attacks.<br><br>The claims were made by Mohammed Babar, an American terrorist turned supergrass who is giving evidence against the men that he claims were his former accomplices. The seven defendants, all from southeast England, are charged with conspiring to bomb a British target, such as a shopping centre, nightclub or train. Six allegedly attended training camps in Pakistan.<br><br>Babar said that he discussed setting up a camp with Waheed Mahmood, 34, of Crawley, who insisted that those who attended had to be prepared to fight jihad (holy war) in Afghanistan. He attempted to recruit through British contacts.<br><br>But the key prosecution witness added: Â“From conversations I had with them [the group] I donÂ’t think they had any intention of sending people into Afghanistan. They would tell [those at camps] later that it was difficult to go and would then give the only other option: working for them on operations in the UK and Pakistan.Â”<br><br>While living in Pakistan, Babar offered to set up a camp for the group. He was also involved in storing bomb ingredients; at one stage he held detonators, ammonium nitrate, aluminium powder, other explosives paraphernalia and ricin in his flat in Lahore. The castor beans, from which ricin is made, were allegedly brought from Islamabad by Omar Khyam, 24, also from Crawley.<br><br>Babar said: Â“He said it was a poison [and talked] about poisoning water supplies or people. He went into detail how to make it.Â”<br><br>He said that the detonators were sourced by Salahuddin Amin, 31, of Luton, with the help of a man who worked for Abdul Hadi, No 3 in command for al-Qaeda. Mr Amin argued with Mr Khyam because he allegedly asked Mr Amin to transport the detonators to Europe or Britain.<br><br>The court was told that the men had ordered Â“survivalÂ” equipment for the training camp from outdoor shops in Britain, and had special clothing made. These included shalwar kameez with zippered pockets for ammunition. A British relative of one defendant posted hiking boots, sleeping bags and solar panels to the men while they were in Pakistan.<br><br>They posed as Western tourists to travel within Pakistan and collect thousands of pounds from contacts, to fund the camp. Mr MahmoodÂ’s brother-in-law allegedly gave about Â£4,000 and another contact provided Â£3,500, which was sent to him from Britain.<br><br>When asked for the source of the rest of the money, Babar said that each of the defendants who travelled to Pakistan months earlier had brought between Â£5,000 and Â£7,000 and entrusted this to Mr Khyam.<br><br>During discussions, some of the defendants allegedly said that they disliked al-Muhajiroun, the radical group that the Government wanted to ban, because it was Â“all talkÂ”.<br><br>Some of the defendants also had leadership squabbles with other British Muslims in Pakistan when offering to provide training in exchange for Mr Khyam and Mr Mahmood becoming the Â“emirsÂ” of another group. This offer was rejected.<br><br>Mr Amin, Mr Mahmood, Mr Khyam, his brother Shujah Mahmood, 18, and Jawad Akbar, 22, all from Crawley, West Sussex; Anthony Garcia, 24, from Ilford, East London; and Nabeel Hussain, 20, from Horley, Surrey; all deny conspiring to cause an explosion likely to endanger life between October 2003 and March 2004.<br><br>Mr Khyam, Mr Garcia and Mr Hussain also deny possessing 600kg of fertiliser for the purposes of terrorism. Mr Khyam and Shujah Mahmood deny possessing aluminium powder, also for the purposes of terrorism. The trial continues.<br><br>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br><br>'Plotters aimed to bomb Tube'<br>[URL=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/article/0,,2-2108768,00.html]LINK[/URL]<br><br>Defendant tried to recruit a London Underground worker for a Â‘martyrdom operationÂ’<br>A MUSLIM Tube worker was asked to become a suicide bomber by an Islamic extremist on trial for plotting to attack a British target, the Old Bailey was told yesterday.<br><br>The London Underground worker, known only as Imran, allegedly attended a terrorist training camp in Pakistan with four of seven men who are charged with conspiracy.<br><br>The court was also told that a key al-Qaeda operative called Q, who gave the men their orders, was living in Luton. Q reported to Abdul Hadi, No 3 in command of the terrorist organisation.<br><br>One defendant, Waheed Mahmood, allegedly sent supplies for al-Qaeda from Britain to Pakistan, including a GPS navigation system, solar panels, invisible ink and cash.<br><br>Another, Omar Khyam, was said to have masterminded a Â“martyrdom operationÂ” with a belt bomb and wanted to know if Imran would be willing to carry it out. But Imran refused because he thought the plot would come to nothing.<br><br>And the older brother of a third defendant, Anthony Garcia, was allegedly planning a separate terrorist attack on a target in Britain.<br><br>The claims were made by Mohammed Babar, an American terrorist turned informant, who is giving evidence against his former accomplices.<br><br>He said that the group discussed how to smuggle bomb parts into Britain and carried out test explosions at a terrorist training camp in Malakand, a mountainous region in northern Pakistan. The first was unsuccessful but the second created a U-shaped hole.<br><br>A video was made of their training camp activities with the intention of adding verses from the Koran, and turning it into recruitment propaganda.<br><br>The men planned to smuggle explosives to Europe inside shampoo bottles, cans of shaving foam or packages of dried fruit Â— shipped, couriered or taken in person Â— while detonators would be concealed in a tape recorder.<br><br>Mr Khyam, 24, from Crawley, West Sussex, also allegedly tricked one Muslim into carrying aluminium powder on to a flight from Pakistan to Britain to see if Customs would detect the substance.<br><br>He attended the camp with his younger brother, Shujah Mahmood, 18, Mr Garcia, 24, from Ilford, East London, and other British Muslims who are not on trial. Salahuddin Amin, 31, from Luton, did not attend because he had undergone previous training.<br><br>The men were said to have dressed and acted like tourists en route so that they would not attract attention. They moved into a hotel, travelled in a minibus emblazoned with its logo, wore Western clothes and stopped praying in public, on the orders of Abdul Hadi.<br><br>The defendants also took numerous photographs of each other while hiking and visiting local landmarks, as proof of their Â“tourist activitiesÂ” if stopped by the authorities.<br><br>-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br><br>Prosecutors rest case in Lodi terror trial, show images of camp<br>[URL=http://www.mercurynews.com/mld/mercurynews/news/local/states/california/northern_california/14208830.htm]LINK[/URL]<br><br>SACRAMENTO - Defense attorneys for a Lodi man charged with attending a terrorist training camp in Pakistan in 2003 and his father were set to begin presenting their evidence Wednesday.<br><br>Prosecutors rested their case Tuesday against 23-year-old Hamid Hayat, calling a government witness who showed jurors satellite images of a suspected terror camp.<br><br>Eric Benn, an analyst with the Defense Intelligence Agency, on Tuesday discussed images that show what he said appear to be a militant training camp similar to one described to FBI agents by Hayat.<br><br>Benn said the mountainous location and description of the camp near Balakot in northeast Pakistan are consistent with statements made by Hayat during an interrogation by FBI agents last June, shortly after he returned to the U.S. following two years in Pakistan. Images taken in 2001 show tents and a variety of buildings.<br><br>"The kind of information I got out of the (Hayat interview) transcript ... is consistent with the physical things I observed," Benn testified in U.S. District Court. "This would be a militant camp. It strengthens my confidence in that."<br><br>The government's case against the Hayat's is built partially on separate confessions they gave to FBI agents.<br><br>Hayat is charged with three counts of lying to the FBI and separate charges of providing material support to terrorists for attending the al-Qaida camp. His father, 48-year-old Umer Hayat, is on trial at the same time before a separate jury. He is charged with lying to federal investigators about his son's attendance at the camp.<br><br>The Hayats' defense attorneys have said their confessions to FBI officials were made only after hours of interrogation and while they were worn down by leading questions. They also have pointed out that both men provided inconsistent testimony.<br><br>Benn's testimony and the satellite images are potentially important because prosecutors have no hard evidence that Hamid Hayat actually attended a terror training camp in Pakistan, an angle defense attorneys have said they will explore when they begin their portion of the case.<br><br>Jurors were shown the satellite images after previously hearing from experts about Pakistan's cultural and political environment. The combined testimony showed that terrorist-training camps and anti-American fervor were prevalent in Pakistan at the time Hamid Hayat was visiting.<br><br>Prosecutors allege that Hamid Hayat attended one such camp and returned to the U.S. in May 2005 to await orders to commit attacks against grocery stores, banks and hospitals. No such attacks were carried out, and the Hayats have pleaded not guilty.<br><br>Hamid Hayat, for example, variously told FBI agents that the camp he attended was in Afghanistan, the Kashmir region, near Tora Bora or at least three other locations far from Balakot, his attorney, Wazhma Mojaddidi, said Tuesday during cross-examination.<br><br>Hayat also discussed receiving pistol training, but Benn said the satellite images did not show obvious locations for a firing range.<br><br>Benn said Hamid Hayat's conflicting statements did not alter his opinion that the satellite images could show the camp he attended.<br><br>"There was a lot of language I had to reconcile," Benn said. "Late in the interview, (Hayat's statements) stopped having any consistency. It sounded like it was just bouncing around."<br><br>Mojaddidi says her client never actually attended a camp.<br><br>Also Tuesday, U.S. District Court Judge Garland Burrell Jr. denied a defense motion to dismiss the charges against the Hayats. Defense attorneys argued that prosecutors had failed to present sufficient evidence to support the charges.</div>

Khan came with a friend and the pair was asked to sign an agreement that would preclude them from disclosing what they saw during a tour of the facility.<br><br>Khan had fake identification, and bogus company credentials, and after the purchase was made, and the Kevlar shipped to an address in Pakistan, Khan returned to his Coventry home. His friend Palvinder Singh, who had come to Toronto for a wedding, also returned to Britain shortly afterwards.<br><br>What happened next to the Kevlar once it reached Pakistan, according to London Metropolitan Police, was enough to send Khan behind bars for nine years.<br><br>Earlier this month, the Briton was jailed for terrorism offences, which included providing equipment for the Pakistani-based separatist group Lashkar-e-Tayibba. Fighting for independence in Kashmir against India, the group has close ties to the Taliban and Al Qaeda, according to Western intelligence services. Both Canada and Britain have designated the group a terrorist organization.<br><br>British police say the militant group was conducting operations in Afghanistan in 2002 and 2003, in areas where British and American forces were stationed, and where Canadian troops now are deployed.<br><br>According to emails later recovered by Scotland Yard investigators, the Kevlar that Khan bought was to be used for armouring up to six vehicles.<br><br>Khan also admitted he attended a Lashkar-e-Tayibba training camp in Pakistan and by September 2001 held a senior role in the organization, responsible for foreign recruits.<br><br>His friend who accompanied him to Barrday was also charged, but acquitted last month after arguing he was presumed guilty by association Â— he knew Khan since childhood but had no knowledge the materials were shipped to a terrorist organization.<br><br>London police hailed the conviction as the arrest of a major "terrorist quartermaster."<br><br>"Khan's conviction is very important. It sends a clear message to anyone prepared to train as a terrorist or support terrorism that they can expect to be prosecuted. We also want to reassure the public that we will continue to do everything possible to fight terrorism," said Peter Clarke, head of London Metropolitan Police's anti-terrorist branch.<br><br>While not often fighting themselves, terrorist quartermasters (those who acquire equipment for the organization) are lifelines for the group.<br><br>"These are people who are fundamentally integral to these kind of organizations or networks because they are the people that actually provide weapons or equipment so that they can carry out these attacks," says Alex Standish, British editor of Jane's Intelligence Digest.<br><br>"Terrorist organizations or groups do not want to draw attention to themselves so there's always a difficulty in procurement."<br><br>Standish says the IRA has a documented history of effectively using quartermasters to quietly import materials from around the world.<br><br>Different grades of aramid fibres, which are best known by its brand name of Kevlar, face export restrictions from Canada if they're military or nuclear grade. It's not clear what type Khan purchased and whether it was on the restricted list, thereby requiring an export permit from the Canadian government.<br><br>International Trade Canada spokesperson Brooke Grantham said he could not disclose if a permit was issued or requested in this case.<br><br>Individual companies may also require certain requirements for the sale of a large amount of Kevlar. A Barrday representative said this week he could not disclose what criteria Khan would have to meet before his sale was completed.<br><br>"Our position is we cannot comment on that issue. We were involved and participated with different police forces to aid in the capture and really we were advised we shouldn't discuss the matter," said Tony Fiorenzini, Barrday VP of manufacturing.<br><br>Khan also pleaded guilty to buying remote control and video equipment and a global positioning system. The London court was told the equipment was used to test an unmanned aerial vehicle "drone." Indian and Pakistani forces in the region have shot down similar drones laden with explosives, the court heard.<br><br>Khan was arrested on Sept. 12, 2003 at London's Heathrow Airport as he returned on a flight from Bahrain. After searching three properties in Coventry, police seized his computer and an air pistol converted to fire live ammunition. He was released on bail but rearrested March 1, 2005 following a further investigation by the police force's anti-terrorist branch.<br><br>The investigation also included American citizens, Masaud Khan, who was jailed for life plus 65 years in June 2004, and Seifullah Chapman, who was sentenced to 85 years for providing material support to the terrorist group.<br><br>Shopping list for militant group<br>Items Mohammed Ajmal Khan and two others acquired or tried to purchase around the world between March 28, 2001 and March 2, 2005 for the purposes of terrorism, according to Scotland Yard:<br><br>1,000 square metres of Kevlar woven fabric to make armour plating for vehicles. A high-tech video system, remote control equipment and global positioning system (GPS). This was used to test an unmanned aerial vehicle "drone" in carrying out tasks Â— videotaping, opening payload doors, cutting off and restarting the engine.<br><br>Two twin cam set headphones with microphones and a hand-held navigation radio.<br><br>Night vision equipment, night sights and thermal imagers.<br><br>Ten carbon dioxide capsules.<br><br>Six hundred ball bearings.<br><br>One airplane stability<br><br>and control computer.<br><br>A Brocock-type air pistol that had been converted to fire live ammunition.<br><br>In total, Khan was involved in buying three air pistols and an attempt to purchase five others.<br><br>One hundred hand<br><br>warmers.<br><br>------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br><br>U.S. officials: Iraqi insurgents educating Afghan, Pakistani militant<br><a href="http://www.mercurynews.com/mld/mercurynews/news/politics/14235657.htm" rel="nofollow">link</a><br><br>Islamic militants in Iraq are providing military training and other assistance to Taliban and al Qaida fighters from eastern and southern Afghanistan and Pakistan's tribal areas, U.S. intelligence officials told Knight Ridder.<br><br>A small number of Pakistani and Afghan militants are receiving military training in Iraq; Iraqi fighters have met with Afghan and Pakistani extremists in Pakistan; and militants in Afghanistan increasingly are using homemade bombs, suicide attacks and other tactics honed in Iraq, said U.S. intelligence officials and others who track the issue.<br><br>Several Afghan and Pakistani "exchange students" volunteered to join the fight against American and Iraqi forces in Iraq, but were told to return to Afghanistan and Pakistan to train other militants there, two U.S. intelligence officials said.

Because This Imperialist also supports Terrorist Group to this very day, and many the Terrorist groups are the creation and consequence on their global interest.</blockquote>It is very true that till the attack on 9/11 happened, most of the developed nations were unaware or was not so serious about terrorism. They all listened to India and Indians at most of the International meets about the danger of terrorism. All used to forget it after the summit. Even they had supported terrorists open handely. Osama is a creation of the Afghan jihad funded by the CIA.<br><br>Today the situation is different. They realise the threat of terrorism. The destruction it can cause. Even the usage of nuclear bombs by terrorists is a reality today. It is necessary to have a globalised effort to eliminate terrorism from this world. The U.S way may not be correct. They must not have gone to the roots of terror (except in Afghanistan). Let's hope that terrorism will be defeated by co-ordinated efforts.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Terrorism has no rules...innocent lives can be lost in a split second.<br><br>If a suicide bomber blows himself up, the law should allow his family to be lynched by an angry mob. This is the only deterent against terrorism. Unless the terrorist knows that his family is in danger and those he cares and loves will die should he carry off his bombing...<br><br>only then...will terrorist be so terrified of terrorism they dont even want to hear that dirty world.<br><br>Therefore the war against terrorism must have no rules. Terrorist must have no hiding hole. And they must know that death can come for them and their families any second too. We have the death penalty. I propose we up the ante a notch further for terrorist.  Any one who fails in his terrorism attempt or is caught attempting terrorism must be put to death in the worse way possible or even executed in public. A absolute deterent must be used against terrorist.<br><br>Our nation is small and fragile. We cannot afford to have any terrorist bombing on our small nation. All citizens must play our part to report any suspicious activities as we all are the eyes of the police. 1% error is not acceptable.<br><br>The moment a man becomes a terrorist, he is too be treated as an animal or a beast which has no regard for human lives. So no regards will be given towards his life. He is too be denied all human rights afforded to even a common criminal.<br><br>Sep 11 is a good example of terrorism left to its own devices.</div>
