              <blockquote>.....Later, on Sky TV,(US Secretary of Defence Robert)
              <p>    Gates said a little more bluntly that he was "not optimistic" about Congress changing the law to allow Raptor exports.</p>
              <p>The possibility that Congress might do this on the basis of a purely hypothetical inquiry from Australia - if we propositioned you, would you say yes? - is pretty remote.</p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">As to the Super Hornets, every person in the official Australian defence establishment knows they have many secret and classified capabilities and that, as part of an Australian system, <span style="text-decoration: underline;">they would be comprehensively able to defeat any other plane in the region</span>. </span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">The debate is hamstrung in part because the classified capabilities cannot be discussed by those who know them, and those who do discuss them don't know them. </span></p>
              <p>There would be at least a $400 million penalty in breaking the contract for the Super Hornets and there would be a serious cost to Australia's reputation.</p>
              <p>But more importantly, everyone associated with air force policy also knows the F1-11s are right at the end of their tether. Even if you believed you could keep them flying into their fifth decade, the decision to scale them down and abandon them has already been taken, and actions have followed that decision.....---http://www.theaustralian.news.com.au/story/0,25197,23269471-31477,00.html</p>

              <p>The F-15 has a better thrust to weight ratio, and in terms of avionics and weaponry they are probably equally matched. However, there is no contest if the F-15s are grounded due to some structural problem :P</p>
              <p>(Yes I know that the grounding only affected F-15 A-Ds, but you never know :P. Structurally, the E variant is not that much different.)</p>

              <p>I think there is a big mis conception and inaccuracies in the debate.</p>
              <p>Both latest F-15 variant (SG) and F-18E/F (Block 2) are fairly evenly matched if used against each other. They do present different roles with different capabilities.  If a deep-penetration striker with capable self-escorting capabilities is what you want, The Strike eagles would be the nature choice. However, if you want a evenly capable strike aircraft and air supriority fighter, then the Super Bugs is your choice.</p>
              <p>Let 's take an objective comparision of these 2 aircrafts:</p>
              <p>Size: Both are approximately the same size, same wing span.</p>
              <p>Thrust to weight ratio: This goes to the Eagles who have 2x 29,00lb engines. The Superbugs have only 2x22,000lb engines.</p>
              <p>Avionics: Both are armed with AESA radar. Of course RSAF variant will be the latest - but untested.  USN (and possibly RAAF) will be armed with the slightly more matured APG-79 AESA. Both have very similar functions and capabilities (air to air modes and ground attacks, SAR, electronic warfare, etc). The APG63V3 AESA on the Eagles have more TR modules though, which made them slightly more capable. However, I was reading some reports that the APG-79 have some really secret capabilities similar (albeit not as capable) to that found on the APG-77 on the Raptors.</p>
              <p>Range: Strike Eagles. Obviously.</p>
              <p>Air combat agility: Super Bugs, due to the great low speed handling control and the use of digital flight control system. The Eagles is still using only a similar digital/analague flight control system I believe... correct me if I am wrong.</p>
              <p>Stealth: F-18E/F has frontal forward stealth capabilities. Eagles has none. The Eagle reflects "like mirrors" once they turn. Thus the pilots tend to fly the Eagles using "tennis courting" maneouver.</p>
              <p>In a head on BVR shootout, they are both equally matched, with the Eagle having a slightly more powerful AESA radar, but the Super bugshave a much lower RCS. Thus I may dare say that the Super bugs actually has a slight advantage of getting the first shots. In terms of WVR, both are armed with JHMCS and AIM-9X. So its the first aircraft that shoot first wins. However, the Superbug have better dogfight agility and thus if they go into a knife fight, the Superbug should have the advantage.</p>
              <p>Of course if terms of strike capability, the Eagles should win in always all area except perhaps one of two counts, first of which, the Super bug can actually carry more types of weapons. Mission flexibility is therefore slightly greater than the Eagles.</p>
              <p>Were the Superbug really incompetent, don't you think it is foolish for USN to replace all their tier 1 fighters (Tomcats) soley with the Superbugs?</p>

              <p>well, i think perhaps one point to take note is the history....</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>cos f-18 was originally built as a sort of "Navy's F-16" ... a light weight multirole fighter.... while f-15 was concepted slightly earlier, as an total air superiority fighter, "not a pound for air-to-ground" ..perhaps with the main aim to brute force win the fight, but we're with the F15SG rite? so maybe its a bit diff , since diff role....</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>well, tt's my 0.0002 x 10^4 cents opinion....</p>

              <p>As of 2008, the F-15 in all air forces has an air-to-air combinekill record of 104 kills to 0 losses in air combat. So what the superbugs score ? <br></p>

              <p>Weapon-load= F15SG(no other combat jet can carry the number of weapons a F15SG/K can carry).</p>
              <p>Mission Flexibility= F15SG(the F15K carries all the weapons the current F18 E/Fs and F15Es carry. The F15I carries Israeli weapons in addition.The F15SGs will most probably carry both American and ISraeli weapons)</p>
              <p>Avionics= F15SG(the F15SG is presumably equipped with the latest EW warfare systems, survivability protection systems, etc). Refer to Israel`s F15I and F16I. They are far far better equipped than the models which the Americans are selling direct. </p>
              <p>Stealth= Negligible. It is not significant. Look at the F18 E/F. It is not the equivalent of a F35/22. I see more along the lines of a sales advertising point; similar to the Rafale`s omni-role capability. Overall, both aircrafts will light up radars given thier sizes viewed from any angle. Coupled with the F15Sgs more powerful radar, this is not an issue.</p>
              <p><br>Maneuverability= Hard to say. Both aircrafts have thier niches. Probably pilot dependant. It does not make a difference if the flight control is digital or a hybrid/digital one if the performance quotient is the same(think F15SG is all digital now like the F15K). More of an engineering/build issue. The F15 is an air-superiority jet upgraded to do multi-role; like the F22s. The F18s are built to do multi-role. My bet is on the F15Sg overall when it comes to maneuverability.</p>

            <div class='col-md body'><p>One needs to look at the nature of the report posted by Lion-noisy. It is targetted at Australians. The defence secretary cannot possibly say that they are getting second best jets. That said, the f18 E/Fs are more than capable in dealing with the new Sukhois in the region. This is especially the case when the F18 E/Fs are tied to C41 systems involving the Wedgetails, UAVs, ground based radars, AAW destroyers, etc. It is a very competent system. Remember, it is about systems now.</p></div>

              <p>Air combat agility: Super Bugs, due to the great low speed handling control and the use of digital flight control system. The Eagles is still using only a similar digital/analague flight control system I believe... correct me if I am wrong.</p>
              <p>Stealth: F-18E/F has frontal forward stealth capabilities.</p>
              <p>However, the Superbug have better dogfight agility and thus if they go into a knife fight, the Superbug should have the advantage.</p>

              <p>Think you have a lot of misconception !!!<br>First airfight - low speed handling is not for dog fight - you lose too much energy .... !!! Eagles have the advantage with raw power - if they get into bad position, they have the more powerful engine to get out of it. <br><br>Another thing - about digital flight control ... is that really that great - please tell that to the russians for i do not see the planes like su-35 and mig-29 having much of it and processing power .... !!!</p>
              <p>Frontal Stealth ? - the radar signature is just a little smaller, not much stealth - if it really have some stealth - f-35 would not been built .. ok give to you on some stealth .. by the way with your plane so short of range - you be carrying 2 tanks and missiles .... opps that so whatever stealth.... it show up on the radar like all other planes ..... !!!</p>
