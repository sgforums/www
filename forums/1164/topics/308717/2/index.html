Weapons are important , training is even more important, logistics is EVERYTHING. It is airforce vs airforce not platform vs platform which counts. A good airforce will always come up with strategies and tactics to be able to neutralize any platform advantage. But an inferior airforce will always lose no matter how superior its aircraft because of poor training and logistics.</p></div>

Was ineffective in getting his way internationally.....modest successes domestically.. ...corruption  and inefficiency reigned unchecked under him and poor badawi had to shoulder the damage. it`s good he`s no longer pm.</p>

              <p><span style="font-size: x-small; color: #ff0000; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><em>UMNO's 60th birthday</em><br><strong>Mahathir has a gift</strong><br>A long DVD attack on its leaders as 'lacking courage' and also touches on ties with Singapore. Blogger Jeff Ooi.<br>May 12, 2006</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">Call it coincidence, but timing couldn't be more perfect.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">As Umno celebrates its 60th anniversary today, a two-hour DVD depicting former Umno president Dr Mahathir Mohamad criticising the current crop of leaders for "lacking courage" makes it to the market.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">The DVD is a recording of Mahathir's speech - titled 'Current Issues in Malaysian Politics' - and Q&amp;A with 100 Malay professionals last December. It was a by-invitation-only event organised by think-tank Institute of Economic and Political Studies (Ikape). </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">For the record, Ikape is headed by former New Straits Times editor-in-chief Abdullah Ahmad aka Dollah Kok Lanas (DKL).</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">A quote from Mahathir in the DVD:</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><em>"If you want things to be right, you have to take the risk. But what I see now is a desire to avoid risks at all cost even if the country goes to the dogs."</em></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">Going to the dogs? You ain't heard nothing yet. "We are also not good at negotiating," said Mahathir. Quote:</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><em>I want to tell you, we had wanted to buy Russian MiGs (fighter planes). You know Russians, they are very inferior. Somehow or other, it was wangled without my knowledge, that part of the money (only to be used to purchase MiGs was also used) to buy (the American made) F-18 (planes). The very good American aircraft costs twice as much as the MiGs. And then, we acquired eight F-18s and 18 MiGs. MiGs are sold to us without any condition. If we feel like bombing Singapore, for example, the Russians are not going to object. Any Singaporeans here? Or ex-Singaporeans?</em></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><em>But this great aircraft called F-18 which we bought from America, after buying it, after several months, I got to know that these aircraft cannot be used for any attacks against any country even if it is not Singapore, because the Americans sold the aircraft, but the source code is kept by them. So you cannot plan anything, you cannot fly them to carry out any bombing attacks against anybody but you have this wonderful aircraft, which you can see at Lima (the Langkawi International Maritime and Aviation Exhibition). So, we spent this huge sum of money and they actually negotiated and agreed to these terms. </em></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><em>So that's why I say we are not very good at negotiating. </em></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">Mahathir also said Umno members were afraid of putting their heads on the chopping block and thus opted for silence when things went wrong.</span></p>

              <p>Its not that manoeuverability isn't important.  A fighter still has turn his nose relatively quick to face his enemy in order for his radar to paint it.  The ability to change directions n run is still crucial.</p>

              <p>Emm..  The Malaysians had F18Ds Hornets, the Aussies are
              getting F18Fs Super Hornets, which are quite different.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>That said, F18s are not known for fantastic
              manoeuvrability.  Even less than the F14s which they
              relaced.  But with helmut mounted sighting systems and missles
              like the AIM9X, manoeuvrability might not be that critical unless
              you going to guns.</p>

              <p>Anyone can verify this? I mean, the F-18s were designed with negative static stability, while the F-14s have positive static stability, shouldn't the F-18s be more maneuverable? The LERXes themselves would give a higher AoA?</p>

              <p>Erm, not exactly.</p>
              <p><br>The F-16 was designed with negative static stability.  It requires the Flight computer make multiple inputs in order the keep the aircraft stable in flight.  Without the flight computer, the aircraft cannot be flown.  However, this also results in enhanced agility.</p>
              <p>Aircraft with negative static stability would be jets like the Eurofighter, Rafales etc.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The F/A-18E/F had reduced static stability, but given its design, they aren't like the F-16s at all.  The Hornets and Eagles IIRC have positive static stability, which means they don't go berzerk while trying to fly level without a flight computer (simplistically).  The F/A-18E/Fs have superb agility at low speeds.  They can pitch and roll while the others are losing control. (That rhymes!)</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Of course, going low and slow isn't helpful in BVR. For now.</p>

              <p>Shud not be drawn to which plane is better.</p>
              <p>If one on one, it  depends on the skill &amp; experience of the pilot. Remember that most of the time in real aerial combat , the better pilot triumphs over the less capable pilot in a superior aircraft.  Yes, a good pilot in a F18 can beat the shXX out of a losuy F15 pilot.</p>

              <p><br>Neutral meaning neither pilots having the advantage in terms of capability, airspeed, and altitude. </p>
              <p>An F-16 vs an F-16, in a head on-BFM setup, bother at 10k ft would be a very neutral set up.  Usually when the situation is so neutral, the pilot would opt to escape.  In this case, blowing through at top speed and not turning back to get out of the opponent's weapons perimeters.</p>
              <p>If an F-16 fights an Su-27 with the Sukhoi starting at the F-16's six, it would be a very defensive fight for the F-16 given the sukhoi's positional advantage, and turning capability.</p>
              <p>So, if the setup is neutral, the best remedy to avoid a deadly gunfight would be to escape as early as possible, before any more positional play can be made that might affect the neutrality of the setup. </p>
