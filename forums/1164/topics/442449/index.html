              In war, the advantages of Depleted Uranium munitions help the United States stomp other countries into the ground. 
              
              The United States and its NATO allies maintain that Depleted Uranium dust (a by-product) doesn't cause cancer and birth defects, however, 136 countries are citing other research saying that it does.
              
              Which side do you think is right?

              It doesn't. It's not radioactive, just dense. The effects of Gulf War Syndrome are due to heavy metal poisoning by inhalation, not radiation. No idiot uses radioactive rounds in war, your own troops stay by the rounds longer than the enemy does.
                      
              And it's not DU that helps the US win wars, it's the sheer bloody numbers and heavy air support.

              <p>I think the US doesn't mind using weapons that expose itself to legal challenges from its own troops- they sprayed alot of Agent Orange in Vietnam. What more for other countries where legal rights are seldom exercised- we should thank the heavens Sg doesn't use DU. We wouldn't get a single penny.</p>
              <p>Still, there's the off chance Singapore Artillery had DU in the 1980s if you catch my drift...</p>
              <p>Anyway, DU munitions can be kept in containers until needed, and then chucked into an A-10's or Abram's magazine some distance from the crew.</p>

              We're supposed to do IPPT until end of reservist, which is I think 55/60?
              
              Ironically, as a geneticist, I'm actually well aware of Agent Orange. What's even more ironic is that pure Agent Orange is actually safe, where the US screwed up in is QC. It was due to chirality. cis-form Agent Orange was a safe defoliant. trans-form Agent Orange is horrifyingly mutagenic. All the Agent Orange they used were a mix of both forms and they never thought that such closely related chemicals could have such drastically different effects. And no, they can't be sued for negligence, negligence needs 3 things to be proven 1) Duty of care (i.e it's their job to take care of the Vietnamese kids-possible) 2) Negligence of care (i.e they knew, but ignored it-possible failure point) and the final kicker 3) All resonable due process (i.e they did everything normally done to check-this is where they can't get sued, they did all the tests, just needed ESP to know that different forms gave such different effects.)

              <p>Having said that, there is some DU used in airplane construction. Just google DU &amp; Boeing 747. Having flown 747s quite regularly over the years, I wonder how come I needed to do RT that much in the past...</p>

              <p>Well, unless I'm mistaken, you've been out of NSF about 15 years ago. Haha I wish I had a chance to do some field camp. End of reservist is 45/55 but MR will come earlier, unless as an officer you wanna voluntarily extend your duties and pick up LTC(NS).</p>
              <p>I guess Agent Orange cases would be treated the same as asbestosis (also widely used in the military)? It was not apparent to anyone what would happen years down the road.</p>
              <p>So, any one else served in the artillery and has mutated offspring to hide in the basement? Although the rest of us can't afford basements.</p>

              Back at you sister. Give me hard numbers from a research organization, not tabloids that have "Elvis weds two headed alien" as the article next to it.
              
              BTW, there are no deaths from Gulf War Syndrome. HM toxicity isn't that fatal and TRICs (Terminal Radiation Induced Cancers) takes years to show up, and even then, it's hard to prove it's from DU and not a normal cancer. I'm in genetics, so I know my cancers and mutagens and in medical field so I've a passing familiarity with metal toxicity.

              9/11 I believe the official line. After all, ole Osama even admitted to it. And there are few  people that hate the US enough to kamikaze. Islamic fundimentalists are one of the few. Others are possibly Japanese from Hiroshima or Nagasaki and Soviet ultra hardliners. China not yet, they still believe in manifest destiny so they'll hold off.
              
              The crap about it being self inflicted is just that, crap. America lost more than it could possibly gain from such a crappy ploy, made their government look weak and incompetent.
              
              Global warming, I'd say yes and no. Sunflare activity will max out in 2012 then decrease. I'm not convinced that global warming is simply due to carbon emissions as flare cycles historically also cause global warming. OTOH, the hole in the ozone layer is the largest at this point than ever in history, so I'd rate it 50/50.
              
              You must be one of those people that only believe things if they are fantastic, sensational and so called "secret".
