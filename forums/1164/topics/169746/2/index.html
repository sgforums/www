Premier Thaksin Shinawatra also has never mentioned helicopters before, although he confirmed there might be a deal to obtain the 12 Sukhol-30 fighter jets, Thai media said.<br><br>Â“This is good news for Russia, we havenÂ’t sold a single cartridge to Thailand,Â” enthused Konstantin Makiyenko, deputy head of the Center for Analysis of Strategies and Technologies, in comments for the Moscow Times Monday. Â“It also means that Russia has taken over the region Â— we have fighter jets in China, Malaysia, Indonesia, Vietnam and now Thailand.Â”<br><br>The Moscow media report said the deal is preliminary and was signed last week in Kuala Lumpur when President Vladimir Putin and Thaksin were both at the East Asia Summit in Kuala Lumpur. It said Russia has signed a preliminary agreement to sell $500 million worth of military aircraft to Thailand, and added it was Â“the first such deal with the traditional U.S. arms client.Â”<br><br>Â“We signed a memorandum for 12 Sukhoi-30MKMs during President Vladimir PutinÂ’s visit [last week] to Malaysia,Â” a senior official at Irkut, the privately controlled maker of the Sukhoi fighter, was quoted as saying.<br><br>Thailand originally agreed to buy the jets last year but put off the deal after a tsunami killed hundreds of thousands of people in the region last December, said the Moscow reports.<br><br>The Irkut executive, who spoke on condition of anonymity due to the sensitivity of negotiations, said the memorandum of understanding also included delivery of helicopters to Thailand, according to Moscow reports. Â“We have gone half the distance and expect to sign the contract in the first half of next year,Â” said Alexei Fyodorov, Irkut board chairman.<br><br>Makiyenko estimated that the deal would bring Russia at least $500 million. Rosoboronexport, the state arms sales agency, was not available for comment to the Russian media.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra and air force commander Chalit Pukpasuk yesterday denied a Moscow Times report that the air force had agreed to purchase a squadron of jet fighters, worth US$500 million, from a Russian manufacturer. Mr Thaksin said in Sukhothai yesterday that Thailand was not committed to buying SU-30 jets from Russia but admitted that the two countries had already signed a letter of discussion on the issue.<br><br>He said the two countries needed to discuss more details and defended the letter as a normal practice to record what had been discussed.<br><br>ACM Chalit said the air force was keeping its options open and no decision was likely to be made before March or April next year.<br><br>``We're not only considering Russia's SU-30 MKs, but also Sweden's JAS 39 Gripens, the US-made F-16 C/Ds, and the F-18 jet fighters, the planned procurement of which had already been scrapped,'' he said.<br><br>ACM Chalit said the new squadron would replace the air force's ageing F-5Es.<br><br>``The new planes must be multi-task aircraft that can support army and naval operations,'' he said.<br><br>The air force would select the model and forward its decision for government consideration. The decision was likely to be made in March or April next year.<br><br>``The prime minister will not impose his ideas on us. I think he knows its best to let the air force handle the matter,'' said the air force chief.<br><br>Mr Thaksin and ACM Chalit made the comments after a security analyst, Panitan Wattanayagor, called on the government to clarify if Thailand was planning a military and political shift from the United States, its long-time ally, to Russia.<br><br>The call from Mr Panitan, a political science lecturer at Chulalongkorn University, came after the Moscow Times reported on Monday that Russia had signed a preliminary agreement to sell US$500 million worth of SU-30 MK military aircraft to Thailand. The signing took place last week in Malaysia during President Vladimir Putin's visit, it said.<br><br>Mr Thaksin said the newspaper report was inaccurate.<br><br>Mr Putin, who was in Malaysia for an Asean summit, also witnessed the signing of a visa exemption agreement between Thailand and Russia. The deal makes Thailand the first Asean country to be party to such an agreement with Russia.<br><br>According to the Moscow Times, Thailand originally agreed to buy Russian jets last year but put off the deal after the tsunami hit the region on Dec 26.<br><br>An executive of Irkut, manufacturer of SU-30 fighter jets, was quoted by the newspaper as saying that a memorandum of understanding also included an offer to deliver a number of helicopters to Thailand, a ``normal bonus'' Moscow had offered in its deals with Malaysia, Indonesia, Vietnam and China.<br><br>Mr Panitan said the prices of the Russian jets might be competitive but they could cause maintenance problems since the air force lacked the expertise or know-how on Russian aircraft technology.<br><br><a href="http://www.bangkokpost.com/News/20Dec2005_news10.php" rel="nofollow">http://www.bangkokpost.com/News/20Dec2005_news10.php</a></div>

So one fighter is still undergoing major maintenance because its flying hours have reached a maximum," Sagoem said.</strong><br><br>He also said that the jet fighters need more maintenance than jet fighters manufactured by the West, at a ratio of 3 to 1.....<br><br><a href="http://www.antara.co.id/en/seenws/index.php?id=7723" rel="nofollow">http://www.antara.co.id/en/seenws/index.php?id=7723</a><br>~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br><br>Major maintenance so fast???<br>The engine hrs maintenance must be very low, i.e. more frequent maintenance!!!!<br><br>You pay half the price , you get half the worth!!! <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br></div>
