            <div class='col-md body'>its all about the support aircraft and air combat doctrine. especially AWACS. it allows fighters to engage enemy aircraft without turning on their own radar, and gives fighters a vast advantage in situational awareness. Pk of missiles, both BVR and WVR, are getting very high now, and outcomes of future air engagement between well equipped combatants would depend more on aerial warfare tactics, rather than individual pilot skill or aircraft capability</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Russia offers copters for SU-30 deal<br><br>Large-size MI-17 matches army's needs<br><br>By Wassana Nanuam<br><br>The army, with only half of its helicopters still functioning, may refill its stock with Russian-made helicopters that will be offered at a special discount if the government, as expected, agrees to buy Russia's SU-30 jet fighters, a military source said. The Royal Thai Army source, who asked not to be named, said Russia might sell its four MI-17 helicopters at a special price or even ``give them free'' if the government goes ahead with its plan to procure the SU-30s, which have become a source of major controversy as the opposition has accused the government of hiding the details of the deal from the public.<br><br>Former army commander-in-chief Gen Prawit Wongsuwan reportedly visited Russia in the middle of this year to see the MI-17s himself, said the source. Moscow is keen on building a centre for aircraft spare parts and maintenance in Thailand in a bid to increase its arms exports to Southeast Asia.<br><br>``We are badly in need of helicopters because currently only 50% of our helicopters are airworthy. We want more because they are necessary,'' especially for missions in the restive far South, said army chief Sonthi Boonyaratglin.<br><br>The MI-17 is an efficient large-size helicopter that matches the army's needs, he said. Around half of the 286 helicopters have been grounded due to a lack of budget for maintenance, the source said.<br><br>Gen Sonthi said the army has already asked the government for a budget for its nine-year army development scheme, which will include plans to repair and buy new helicopters. The scheme will unfold next year.<br><br>``We have to be very careful on any arms deals because they could also affect friendly relations between Thailand and the US, our main arms supplier,'' said a general responsible for the army's logistics.<br><br><a href="http://www.bangkokpost.com/News/25Dec2005_news12.php" rel="nofollow">http://www.bangkokpost.com/News/25Dec2005_news12.php</a></div>
