The Su-30 looks good on paper but is basically unproven technology, moreover the Russians are famous for overstating the capabilities of their weapons. With the most updated avionics, new APG-63V(3) radar, reliable F110-GE129 engines and AIM-120C5 missiles, the F-15SG will be a potent counter to any projected Flanker development, with the possible exception of the Su-35.<br><br>Any news as to the kinds of ground attack weapons the Thai AF will be getting along with the Su-30s? Will it be basic munitions like KAB-500 bombs and AS-14 missiles or more sophisticated weapons like the AS-17 or AS-18?<br>Interesting point to note that if the Thai AF acquires the AA-12 Adder BVRAAM as well they would have US BVRAAMs in the form of AIM-120C5 on the F-16A/Bs operated alongside the AA-12 on the Su-30s.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I hope the Thais are making the right decision ... this smacks too much of a boys toys game (everyone's getting them, so I  should too !)... and yeah ... their logistics must be a nightmare right now ... with bits and pieces from all over the place .... chinese APCs, Stingray tanks, M60s, harriers, 3 different blocks of F-16s ... etc .....<br><br>and now flankers ! .....  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_confused.gif" alt="Confused" title="Confused"><br><br>I shall leave to the performance of the aircraft to other fellow armchair pundits over here ... but i expect more countries to be buying Russian aircraft in the future ... fact is, the americans (and European makers too )are pricing themselves out of the market ... F-16s used to be less than $30mil each ... but now super hornets, euro-fighters and strike eagles are going for like $45 to nearly $100million a pop ... not many countries can afford to throw these sort of money around ,... and if the basic unit cost of even a low cost JSF is going to be more than $40million a pop, many more countries are going to switch to russian planes i think ...<br><br>not that flankers are dirt cheap actually ... but because the russians showed willingness to barter trade .... they'll take things like palm oil (our dear chappies up north), and thai rice (I'm guessing ) ... and if you do not have the kind of money like we do to throw around like we do ... you'll go to the russians for an easy line of credit ....<br><br>Next big player on the block ... the Chinese .... J10 perhaps ? ... and why not ? ... the way the Russians are selling to everyone (especially the chinese), they are opening their legs real wide ... I'm sure the chinese are picking up on their learning curve ... and they do produce indigenous fighters already (e.g J-<img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool">, with assorted countries falling all over themselves to sell to the Chinese what they don't have, or don't know (yet) ....

            <div class='col-md body'>Singapore uses the Igla anti-aircraft missile, which is of Russian design.<br><br>Maneuverability of aircraft is only one characteristic, and it is getting less important with time. More important are avionics compatibility, operational availability, and TCO. Most of the cost of the F-15SG is not in the airframe but the avionics, and it certainly has superior avionics compatibility and operational availability to the Su-30. It also probably has a lower TCO. The cost of operating a plane is several the purchase cost over the lifespan of the aircraft. For the F-15, there is a large and reliable source of spares, an efficient supply chain, and extensive maintentance experience. If we need a spare part to get an AOG plane up, we can order one off the shelf from Uncle Sam and have the plane flying in hours. For a Su-30, the spares may need to be produced specially for you, and lead time may be months since there is no user on the scale of the USAF for the F-15. A more maneuverable plane might win battles, but actually having your planes able to take off wins wars.</div>

So far the SAF has preferred Western arms over these products.</div>

Kelantan is a logical choice for basing given the long range of the Su-30s which can be deployed to any area of conflict in Thailand or Indonesia.</div>
