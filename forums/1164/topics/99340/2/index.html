            <div class='col-md body'>As others have said, the point of the exercise is not who wins or loses. The point of the exercise is to improve your skills. In fact, it is likely that the ROEs and types of exercises were purposefully set to be difficult for our pilots so that they learn more. After all, you learn more when things go wrong.<br><br>For example, in the IAF vs USAF F-15 exercise, the Indians beat the US pilots, but they outnumbered the US pilots 2 to 1, disallowed US AMRAAMs and phased array radar, and only practiced ground-controlled intercept (no US AWACS). This is a worst case situation for the US pilots and it is unsurprising that they were beaten. But the point is for the US pilots to learn more. Otherwise, the whole exercise simply becomes the US pilots getting an intercept from AWACS, acquiring the targets from long range with the advanced radar, shooting lots of AMRAAMs from BVR and flying home. You can do that in a simulator, no need to go to India. Of course it is not fair to the US pilots, but that's the point.<br><br>The same thing probably applies for this exercise. The point is not a fair fight to see whose dick is longer. The point is to challenge our pilots. Without the specifics of the exercise scenario it is impossible to gauge the outcome. We probably fought with no AWACS (I did not hear that we sent our AWACS there), and no AMRAAMs.<br><br>There is another reason why these exercises are so artificial -- you don't want to reveal your true capabilities to another country, even a friendly one. For example, in naval exercises, submarines are purposefully modified so that they sound different from normal, so that other the countries in the exercise cannot obtain the submarine's sound signature. I doubt we showed the Indians all of our goodies, and I doubt the Indians showed us all of theirs. Enough said.<br><br>I wouldn't worry too much about the report. The Indians have a strong interest in projecting an image of superiority over Pakistan, and their press is very free. This is not very diplomatic of them, but they can't control their newspapers. As long as our pilots learn something (like how to combat Su-30s), the exercise is a success.</div>

Like joint weapon usage so on</div>

The point of the exercise is to improve your skills. In fact, it is likely that the ROEs and types of exercises were purposefully set to be difficult for our pilots so that they learn more. After all, you learn more when things go wrong.<br><br>For example, in the IAF vs USAF F-15 exercise, the Indians beat the US pilots, but they outnumbered the US pilots 2 to 1, disallowed US AMRAAMs and phased array radar, and only practiced ground-controlled intercept (no US AWACS). This is a worst case situation for the US pilots and it is unsurprising that they were beaten. But the point is for the US pilots to learn more. Otherwise, the whole exercise simply becomes the US pilots getting an intercept from AWACS, acquiring the targets from long range with the advanced radar, shooting lots of AMRAAMs from BVR and flying home. You can do that in a simulator, no need to go to India. Of course it is not fair to the US pilots, but that's the point.<br><br>The same thing probably applies for this exercise. The point is not a fair fight to see whose dick is longer. The point is to challenge our pilots. Without the specifics of the exercise scenario it is impossible to gauge the outcome. We probably fought with no AWACS (I did not hear that we sent our AWACS there), and no AMRAAMs.<br><br>There is another reason why these exercises are so artificial -- you don't want to reveal your true capabilities to another country, even a friendly one. For example, in naval exercises, submarines are purposefully modified so that they sound different from normal, so that other the countries in the exercise cannot obtain the submarine's sound signature. I doubt we showed the Indians all of our goodies, and I doubt the Indians showed us all of theirs. Enough said.<br><br>I wouldn't worry too much about the report. The Indians have a strong interest in projecting an image of superiority over Pakistan, and their press is very free. This is not very diplomatic of them, but they can't control their newspapers. As long as our pilots learn something (like how to combat Su-30s), the exercise is a success.</div></blockquote>well say. i am much relieved now.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"></div>
