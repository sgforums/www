Regardless Singapore relies more of F16 on a air to ground role which is more of its primary purpose. Piting it air to air with a Su-30 is definitely with advantage on the su-30 side.<br><br>With the SU-30 have 2 more powerful engine, in a situation, that it found itself to be disadvantaged, it just have to full power and get out of the fight, as F-16 does not have that engine power to follow.<br><br>However in real combat situation, by doing that F-16s may have achieved the goal of interception, even if SU-30 does that, it cannot say that it won, as it have used up valuable fuel in doing that and unable to complete the rest of the mission effectively.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>How do you pit a SEAD and CAP oriented fighter against an interceptoran expect a fair and balanced result?The fact that both are almost equal in ability already says as much about the F-16's ability to be an all-rounded fighter,While it does not have the top speed of a SU-30, it does have better agility in tight turns and dogfight manuevers.Any advantage gained by long-range combat radius is neutralised to a certain extent by BVR missiles.Therefore, the field is skewed.We need not lose too much sleep over this. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"></div>
