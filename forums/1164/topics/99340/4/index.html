Sometimes it is not the number of pieces of 'men' on the board that counts but rather the quality, pawns can only move one step at the time.<br><br>Being formidable during exercises is a nice plus factor for morale but it is not as critical as during the actual conflict itself, so lets hope RSAF gets its ass kicked at every exercise with foreign forces and learns to address the weaknesses.<br><br>And I also have another question, one versus one, the F16 may lose to the Sukhoi. Two F16s against one Sukhoi, I don't think the results could be the same. So in India, what were the rules of engagement? How many Sukhois versus how many F16s for each set up?? Did they use their war seasoned pilots against our inexperienced no war experience less than 500 hours 'young birds'?? We will never ever know.<br><br>Nah.... there are still too many unanswered questions to really believe the IAF report. Relax lah brudders.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><span class="large">Here some  " offical " comments on Sindex-04</span><br><br>Singapore and India take part in joint air exercise<br><br>October 28, 2004<br><br>Hello and welcome to Connections. IÂ’m Yvonne Gomez.<br><br>The Republic of Singapore Air Force, or RSAF, flew its F-16 fighter jets into the Indian Air Force, or IAF station at Gwalior in northern India this month.<br><br>This joint air exercise, codenamed Sindex-04, was a first between Singapore and India, and saw interaction between the RSAF and IAF at an operational level.<br><br>A Defence Policy Dialogue has also been set up to enhance bilateral defence cooperation and to discuss regional security issues.<br><br>For more, I spoke to Dr Andrew Tan, who is Assistant Professor at the Institute of Defence and Strategic Studies in Singapore.<br><br>He first gave me a background of defence cooperation between Singapore and India.<br><br>AT: I think historically, SingaporeÂ’s defence relations have chiefly been with the United States, Australia, and also with the Five-Power Defence Arrangement. Defence relations with India have not been substantial, which is why we are only now seeing the first joint air exercise. Nonetheless, there have been naval exercises previously, and relations between India and the various Southeast Asian countries have been improving and developing quite rapidly in the last couple of years. In fact, ASEAN has a dialogue partnership with India, for example.<br><br>Mr Prashant Dikshit is Deputy Director of the Institute of Peace and Conflict Studies in India, and a retired Air Commodore in the Flying Branch of the Indian Air Force.<br><br>He told me that one of the primary objectives of the development process of nation-states is to establish military-to-military contact. This, he said, promoted better understanding between countries.<br><br>PD: Part of this exercise between the Singapore and Indian air forces came about with this objective. Also, the Singapore air force, has for some time, been wanting to operate with the Indian Air Force. I also recall, years ago, they had wanted to use the armament target systems in India, so that theyÂ’re able to learn their own weapons systems application exercises in India. Now this particular relationship and mutual exercise came about primarily, because both India and Singapore are key players in the Indian Ocean, and the larger relationship developing between India and the U.S., so the Singapore air force had to play an important role.<br><br>The Singapore Air Force uses American F-16 C/D jets, and the Indian Air Force several Russian jets, including the Sukhoi-30. What are some differences between the American- and Russian-made jets? Dr Tan explains.<br><br>AT: ThereÂ’s no such thing as a better fighter aircraft at that level. I think the difference lies in the quality of pilot training, and perhaps the kind of avionics that have been installed in all these aircraft. The Su-30 is a very good aircraft Â– top of the line Russian Â– and the other aircraft that they operate is the MiG-29, which is a very good fighter bomber. So they are very good aircraft. But the F-16 will continue to be in operation for number of years yet, until the Americans are able to bring the joint-strike fighter into production.<br><br>Air Commodore Dikshit also shared his views on the Russian- and American-made jets.<br><br>PD: Amongst the type of aircraft which you have just elucidated, the F-16 essentially compares with the MiG-29 and the Mirage 2000. The F-16 is definitely an aircraft of some stature in the American machine, but certainly not one of the finest ones with the American flag. The F-16 has standard modern avionics on board, and similarly, so does the Mirage 2000, the MiG-29, and definitely the Su-30 MKI. The comparisons between them essentially grow out of the manoeuvrability of these aircraft in a tight airspace. On the other hand, if youÂ’re thinking of operating the systems in a larger well-spread space-based controls systems. Then the efficacy of these systems will depend beyond the visual horizon weapons systems.<br><br>Both Dr Tan and Air Commodore Dikshit both mention Â“avionicsÂ”. Just what does this mean, and how does it affect the quality of an aircraft? Dr Tan elaborates on this.<br><br>AT: They are electronic equipment that is placed into the aircraft, or integrated into the aircraft, and they enable the aircraft to track and scan the environment, and also to deliver munitions accurately. They also enable the aircraft to detect other aircraft, for example. To a large degree, the quality of the electronics, as well as the quality of pilot training, determine the ability of one aircraft to prevail against another in a dogfight. But of course, the quality of the aircraft in terms of engineering has got to be there, and I think the Su-30, MiG-29 and F-16 C/D are all within more or less, the same category.<br><br>Interestingly, the air force of Pakistan, IndiaÂ’s closest neighbour is also equipped with F-16 jets. How does this joint exercise with Singapore increase the familiarity of IndiaÂ’s air force with F-16 aircraft?<br><br>PD: As any other modern air force, it takes into cognizance of an F-16 variant of aircraft in the Pakistani air forceÂ’s inventory. But on the other hand, Pakistan has had some difficulty obtaining F-16s from the Americans due to difficulties in their relationship, probably brought about by the impositions of the American Senate or Congress. They have not been able to get the newer-produced aircraft from the USA, and also the supply line has diminished. So comparisons between the Indian Air Force and the Pakistan Air Force would not be appropriate because the Indian Air Force has developed itself for India as a larger power straddling the Indian Ocean, and with relationships with other nation-states in the region. The Indian Air Force has developed capacities for air-to-air refueling.<br><br>So what can the Singaporean air force pilots involved in the joint air exercise learn from their Indian counterparts? Dr Andrew Tan believes that armed forces the world over benefit from joint military exercises with other countries.<br><br>AT: I think itÂ’s always useful to train with other armed forces whether on land, in the sea or in the air, the reason being the experience in doing so enables the Singapore Armed Forces to develop a certain degree of experience and flexibility in operating or encountering different kinds of equipment that helps develop the professionalism of the Singapore armed forces. I think thatÂ’s important for all armed forces.<br><br>And what knowledge and experience can pilots from Singapore share with their Indian counterparts?<br><br>PD: The Indians have definitely to gain from their experiences along with the Singapore air force if they operate in the vicinity of Singapore, which they did a little while ago. The gains are of maritime operations, maritime strikes and maritime surveillance, and operating in a somewhat Â“tropicalisedÂ” atmosphere. On the other hand, the Singapore air force operating in India stands to gain from overland operations, in a zone where the visibility problems are of a different type, when compared to Singapore.<br><br>That was Mr Prashant Dikshit, retired Air Commodore in the Flying Branch of the Indian Air Force, and currently Deputy Director of the Institute of Peace and Conflict Studies in India.<br><br>Earlier in the programme, we also heard from Dr Andrew Tan, Assistant Professor at SingaporeÂ’s Institute of Defence and Strategic Studies.<br><br>The joint air exercise has reportedly been a success. There are now plans to hold joint army exercises, and cooperate in defence and homeland security technology between the two militaries.<br><br>India is also keen to work with Singapore, Malaysia and Indonesia to increase security in the Singapore and Malacca Straits.<br><br>http://rsi.com.sg/english/connections/view/20041028123126/1/.html<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Ho! I'm back again.   Honestly, I think the RSAF prolly wasn't going there to "win" in any competition.  But to learn as much as possible, operating against disimilar aircraft types.  Some of the simplest things for example, is how recognize the sillouhuette, shape of the different type of aircraft with the Mark 1 Human eyeball.  Sounds easy?  Try doing that while going @ 440kts.<br><br>In anycase, I'm sure our pilots learnt much from this experience.  Though the results of the exercise may not mean "victory,"  it has prolly provided our air force personnel an insight of operations envelope for the diff types of aircraft.<br><br>Winning like hell in exercises doesn't mean a thing when u lose an actual battle.<br>Losing like crap in exercises may not actually reflect actual combat performance.  Exercises do tend to have the odds stacked up.</div>

Malaysia and India do not have close ties than to Pakistan. F-16 and SU-30 roles are dif... SU-30 is mainly against the F-15. In fact, JSF is a threat as it is sort of stealthy.<br><br>Enough said, US govt has started its control of sales to certain nations. In fact, although Boeing may say much abt the F/A-18, what equipment and weapons that can be sold eventually are still under US Govt's hands and control (E.g of the inital purchase of AIM-120 for F-16)<br><br>I must remind you that there are SAF top people seeing this forums as well. Though it may be a feedback, but there are many scrects that cannot be said. Malaysia did not buy the long range R-77 eventually due to budget constraints.

            <div class='col-md body'>TUDM is actually losing sleep as RSAF has lots of cooperation exercise or exchanges with other nations.

Maybe Eurofighter Typhoons - but then, what do I know?<br><br>And for an airforce that is tasked to defend national airspace, and with no great ambitions of force projection or long-range surveillance, it is better to concentrate on just that, instead of participating in bilateral or multi-lateral air defence exercises. Its a question of priorities and national interests, after all. And the need to maintain the tough guy, Top Gun image at all costs - you never know when buddy-buddy turns into paranoia!<br><br>The RMAF is doing all that it is supposed to do. No eyebrows raised.<br><br>And there's still plenty of mileage left in those Su-30s - canards or no canards!</div>

Moreover considering the fact that our Falcons are currently and will be in the future be engaging with russian's plane in India, i can assume that we know more about Malaysian planes than Malaysians knowing our planes.<br><br><blockquote>And I believe that Boeing has conducted several in-depth briefings for the RMAF in their bid to persuade Malaysia to acquire the Super Hornet aircraft - which include exhaustive analyses of the F/A-18 variants against the F-16 variants,</blockquote>Considering that ur assumption is true, the HornetFs was a part of our procurement programme, we can assume that the Americans briefed us on the uses of their planes agaisnt the SU-30MKX.<br><br><blockquote>as well as the whys and wherefores of the JSF programme.</blockquote>Prelim Customer information are not secrets.
