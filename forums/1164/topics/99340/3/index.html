Its all subjective as to who's simulating Blue/Red Air. Definitely we take turns to simulate Blue/Red Air and usually the Red Air will be cuffed ( simulate less capable weapons, etc).

Businessman all very happy.<br><br>I think in the end... what is important is not a question of who were the victors of the exercise...  the important outcome seems like everyone was happy.

            <div class='col-md body'>F-16 is design to be a cost effective fighter, it is a good multi-purpose plane that will still will be the star fighter in any war.<br><br>Getting a F-16 to fight a su-30 is exactly like asking the F-16 to dog fight the f-15. Of course the F-16 is in disadvantage as both F-15 and Su30 have twin engine which have more power and more equipment.<br><br>But of course for getting F-15 and Su30 there is a price to pay, which is so much more expensive. Even US cannot afford that much F-15 that why the main backbone fighters is still F-16.<br><br>Although Su-30 is consider great, I am sure the RSAF already have that consideration, that is why they are looking for NGF like eurofighter, which is totally design from the start to outfight su-30 from the start.</div>
