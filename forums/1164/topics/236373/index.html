And let's not forget, the Polish themselves bought Leopard 2A4s despite having their Twardys.  Doesn't say much about the confidence they have in their own tanks does it?<br><br>As for subs, MY has not officially bought a sub yet.  As for our subs, yes they are old but don't forget, we are new to sub warfare.  Doesn't make sense getting the best sub in the world when you are new to sub warfare does it?

            <div class='col-md body'>With reference to posting by sgf,<br><br>1.    One shud never underestimate the capability of  a weapon system such as Twardy. After all it has a 125 mm gun and a state of the art French fire control system.  At the ranges ( probably less than 1500 m &gt; 90 % of the time ) encountered in this part of the world, it wud be difficult to miss a target such as a Leo 2.  Also  remembering that the Leo 2 ( as it is now )  does not have the latest armor, a 125 mm round will make a nice hole in  Leo 2's  armor. Also, the Twardy has ERA.<br><br>2.   Malaysia I believe  has already purchased 2 Scorpenes from France. The subs are also state of the art &amp; are certainly a force to reckon with.<br><br>3.    MIG29s  were designed specifically to counter the F16. Against the<br>F16s  in a one  to one dogfight using R 73 and HMS, they outclass the F16. The West was shocked back in the early nineties  when the Lufwaffer's MIG29s outfought F16s by a very wide margin.<br><br>4.     One must not forget that Russian weapons in the 1973 ME war did very well against Western weaponry. SA 6s shot A4s and F4s out of the sky, AT3s knocked out Centurions and M60s and T55s and T62s knocked out M60s.<br>Also, recently in the Lebanon conflict, Russian ATGMs knocked out Merkavas.<br><br>5.     Quite a number of  Russian weaponry is innovative and effective especially if used by competent soldiers. There are actually many Russian weapons which outclass Western ones.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I don't think those statistics are entirely accurate.  a more accurate gauge would be something like Jane's Sentinel or something.  If i'm not wrong, japan continues to spend more money than china on defence expenditure.<br><br>On Singaporean defence expenditure, I don't believe we have much of a choice in our spending.  We may have a huge number of reserves to call up but how many can we reliably field?  It's not like we'll be sending all 400,000 rushing across the causeway.  so we're stuck with 20,000 regulars and some of our more reliable reserves (compared to malaysia's 100,000) and having to spend money on expensive equipment.  let's not forget that man for man the malaysian soldiers are better than us (though we arguably beat them in terms of systems).<br><br>even our equipment doesn't give us a decisive edge.  in our hands, artillery is nothing more than a tactical weapon but in the hands of our neighbours it is a strategic weapon.  we may in event of a war manage to push forward to KL and gain strategic depth but the malaysians will still be able to bleed us with non-conventional tactics.<br><br>so we're stuck trying to build us some sort of edge by spending more money on equipment.  hopefully with the friendly abdullah administration we'll be able to divert more money from defence spending.<br><br>oh yar, i think a large amount of the difference comes from the fact that malaysians are paid pittance compared to us.  if we take into accout purchasing price parity, we might not be spending that much more money.<br></div>

One shud never underestimate the capability of  a weapon system such as Twardy. After all it has a 125 mm gun and a state of the art French fire control system.  At the ranges ( probably less than 1500 m &gt; 90 % of the time ) encountered in this part of the world, it wud be difficult to miss a target such as a Leo 2.  Also  remembering that the Leo 2 ( as it is now )  does not have the latest armor, a 125 mm round will make a nice hole in  Leo 2's  armor. Also, the Twardy has ERA.<br><br>2.   Malaysia I believe  has already purchased 2 Scorpenes from France. The subs are also state of the art &amp; are certainly a force to reckon with.<br><br>3.    MIG29s  were designed specifically to counter the F16. Against the<br>F16s  in a one  to one dogfight using R 73 and HMS, they outclass the F16. The West was shocked back in the early nineties  when the Lufwaffer's MIG29s outfought F16s by a very wide margin.<br><br>4.     One must not forget that Russian weapons in the 1973 ME war did very well against Western weaponry. SA 6s shot A4s and F4s out of the sky, AT3s knocked out Centurions and M60s and T55s and T62s knocked out M60s.<br>Also, recently in the Lebanon conflict, Russian ATGMs knocked out Merkavas.<br><br>5.     Quite a number of  Russian weaponry is innovative and effective especially if used by competent soldiers. There are actually many Russian weapons which outclass Western ones.  </div></blockquote>1. We don't know what sort of modifications will be done with the Leopard 2A4s or whether or not they will be upgraded to A5 standard or not. Moreover, the Leopard 2s were armored with the same armor as the Challenger etc. Back in the Gulf war, some Challengers took hits from 125mm rounds but survived. ERA armour, unless it is the latest ERA from Russia, which I'm not sure if the Poles had the latest technology, is not very effective against KE rounds. Moreover, Western MBTs were always offered more protection for the crews than Russian MBTs.<br><br>2. Scorpenes are good, and I wonder when we will go grab some German submarines.<br><br>3. MIG29s are admittedly good, though I think their advantage will be somewhat negated if our F-16s are linked up with our AEW aircraft.<br><br>4. Do the M'sians have the latest Kornets and RPG-27?<br><br>5.

But if a S'porean himself has so little faith in the armed forces which is supposed to protect him, you can flush Psychological Defence (one of the 5 aspects of Total Defence) down the drain.
