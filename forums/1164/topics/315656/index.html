              <p>I am not saying WW 3 ,the last war in the world,will come</p>
              <p>soon.</p>
              <p>US and PRC acted like children to show off their toys in turn.This will not help bringing peace to Earth,of course.</p>
              <p>Nor they will declare wars only after they think their technology are mature enough.JUST DI IT!</p>
              <p>Lets recap the childish acts by two giants:</p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">Date................ What happened</span></p>
              <p>US Independant day 06.....N Korean shot 7 missiles towards Japan,only about 250 km from Japan</p>
              <p>Oct 06.........N Korea nuke test.US satellite ,flying over NK,was reported blinded by PRC laser</p>
              <p>2007 CV Kitty Hawk was refused entry at last minute to HK on a scheduled visit,disappointing thousand of family of the crews</p>
              <p>2008.... PRC shot her own satellite on some excuse,</p>
              <p>followed by US showing off the same.</p>

              <p>Well we all know he has this inability to get his point across properly... assuming he had a point to get across in the first place.</p>

              <p>I can only imagine far more errors will pop up had anybody actually bothered to read, but of cause it's not worth our time at all.It's just another pointless thread in this forum, and his only hope is that noobs who come in here unaware of his previous action will reply and become his captive audience.

              <p>if US and UK build similiar underground sub bases,would any one make a comment?</p>
              <blockquote>
              <p>Satellite imagery, passed to The Daily Telegraph, shows that a substantial 
                    harbour has been built which could house a score of nuclear ballistic 
                    missile submarines and a host of aircraft carriers.</p>
              <ul class="storylist">
              <li><strong><a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/telegraph/multimedia/archive/00666/china-nuclear-big_666891a.jpg">Satellite 
                         image of the harbour: click to enlarge</a> </strong></li>
              </ul>
              <p>In what will be a significant challenge to US Navy dominance and to countries 
                    ringing the South China Sea, one photograph shows China’s latest 094 nuclear 
                    submarine at the base just a few hundred miles from its neighbours.</p>
              <p>Other images show numerous warships moored to long jettys and a network of 
                    underground tunnels at the Sanya base on the southern tip of Hainan island.</p>
              <div class="mpu">
              <div class="cont"><a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/majornews/1917167/Chinese-build-secret-nuclear-submarine-base.html#continue">Article continues</a></div>

              <a name="continue"></a></div>
              <p>Of even greater concern to the Pentagon are massive tunnel entrances, 
                    estimated to be 60ft high, built into hillsides around the base. Sources 
                    fear they could lead to caverns capable of hiding up to 20 nuclear 
                    submarines from spy satellites.</p>
              <p>The US Department of Defence has estimated that China will have five 094 
                    nuclear submarines operational by 2010 with each capable of carrying 12 JL-2 
                    nuclear missiles.</p>
              <p>The images were obtained by Janes Intelligence Review after the periodical was 
                    given access to imagery from the commercial satellite company DigitalGlobe.</p>
              <p>Analysts for the respected military magazine suggest that the base could be 
                    used for "expeditionary as well as defensive operations" and would 
                    allow the submarines to "break out to launch locations closer to the US".</p>
              <p>It would now be "difficult to ignore" that China was building a 
                    major naval base where it could house its nuclear forces and increase it "strategic 
                    capability considerably further afield".</p>
              <p>The development so close to the sea lanes vital to Asian economies "can 
                    only cause concern far beyond these straits".</p>
              <p>Military analysts believe that China’s substantial build up of its forces is 
                    gaining pace put has remained hidden from the world in the build-up to the 
                    Olympics.</p>
              <p>China has diverted much of its resources from the huge Peoples Liberation Army 
                    to the navy, air force and missile development.</p>
              <p>An old Russian aircraft carrier, bought by Beijing for "leisure activities" 
                    has been picked over by naval architects who hope to "reverse engineer" 
                    the ship.</p>
              <p>Within the next five to 10 years the People's Liberation Navy is expected to 
                    build up to six carriers which will also coincide with the Royal Navy’s 
                    construction of two major carriers.</p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">The location of the base off Hainan will also give the submarines access to 
                    very deep water exceeding 5,000 metres within a few miles, making them even 
                    harder to detect. </span></p>
              <p>Britain’s Trident submarines have to remain on the surface when they leave 
                    Faslane in north east Scotland and cannot dive to depth until outside the 
                    Irish Sea.</p>
              <p>While it has been known that China might be developing an underground base at 
                    Sanya, the pictures provide the first proof of the base’s existence and the 
                    rapid progress made.</p>
              <p>Two 950 metre piers and three smaller ones would be enough to accommodate two 
                    carrier strike groups or amphibious assault ships.</p>
              <p>Christian Le Miere, editor for Jane's Intelligence Review, said the complex 
                    underlined Beijing’s plan “to assert tighter control over this region".</p>
              <p>"This is a challenge to any hegemonic power, particularly the US which 
                    still remains dominant in the region."</p>
              <p>So far China has offered no public explanation for its building at Sanya.</p>

              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">Very deep water is not necessary an advantage works for PLAN as no matter how deep the water is, the nuclear submarine only can submerge till 400-500m at most. Furthermore, the opponent, USN has far more rich experience in operating modern nuclear submarines in open sea/ocean then PLAN, thanks to the fact that Yanks’ SSN played “Tom &amp; Jerry” game with USSR during cold war. </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;"> </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">US’s SSN equips better sonar system, which works in low and ultra low frequencies. Those low Freq sonar works best in deep water as shallow water’s depth and background noise interference the low-freq sonar’s working. Also, the deep water works for both PLAN &amp; USN, deep water can provide better hiding for USN’s SSN as well. </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;"> </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">The problem for Yanks is their SSN deployment in pacific is far more too less than PLAN’s SSK like Kilo, Song, Yuan and 093 SSN. If Chinese continuing add number of surface battle group in their South sea fleet HQed in Hainan, then will make US SSN even harder to work alone in South China Sea.</span></p>

              <p>Well thats why some submarine bases prefer to have shallow water access for submarines. While its to track the submarine on the surface, other submarines will find it hard to get close to track as well.</p>
              <p>They'd have to wait further outside, nearer to deeper waters and hopefully catch their "prey" near their release points.  </p>
              <p>Areas like these outside US Submarine naval bases are also frequently deloused by P-3Cs.</p>

            <div class='col-md body'><p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">But I think it will be the last resort for SSN to use active low or ultra low freq sonar to ping hostile target, in doing so, the SSN will nevertheless expose its own location and invite trouble. So it’s a dilemma, as today’s modern submarine is so quiet, only passive sonar is very hard to find the enemy in a distance. If you apply the active sonar, it will release your own whereabouts.</span></p></div>

              <p>Er, I didn't say anything on Active Sonar did I?</p>
              <p>Anyway, IMO, only 3 things should ping, and in respect to their importance or danger level, "Torpedoes, Helos, and Planes."</p>
              <p>Modern submarines are quiet... when they are slow.  If you can make them go faster than they are supposed to, you'd find them.  Everything about warfare is a dillema and a chicken &amp; egg situation.  Thats why there are tacticians and strategists. </p>
              <p>If you play chess, you'd realize that every piece you decide to exchange is a dillema.  But its the way you develop your pieces to support it, and how you make use of surprise and a high tempo of operations to stress your opponent to make a mistake. Then capitalize the mistake and go for the kill.</p>
