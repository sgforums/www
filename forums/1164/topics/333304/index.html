              <p>'XM-25' wireless airburst slugs hit round corners<br> <br> <img src="http://regmedia.co.uk/2008/09/30/xm25_smartgun.jpg" border="0" alt=""><br> <em>You'd better be hiding around <em>two</em> corners these days</em><br> <br> It's quite difficult to make guns - portable ones, anyway -
              convincingly hi-tech. Sure, you can add a laser sight, you can attach
              all kinds of crazy lights and optics, you can even have a boresight
              camera and helmet heads-up display for shooting round corners without
              sticking your neck out*. But at the end of the day it will still,
              basically, be a gun. Lumps of metal driven by expanding gas will fly
              out of the end at high speed, and make holes in things or people which
              they hit.<br> <br> Judge Dredd, one of relatively few sci-fi gunmen to stick mainly with
              projectiles rather than moving to rayguns of some kind, does a bit
              better. Placing Justice Department boot to perp arse on the mean
              streets of Mega-City One, he uses implausibly reliable voice
              commandware to select different types of ammo for his Lawgiver pistol.
              In some of the stories he had extremely exotic rounds available, too -
              rubber ricochet bullets for tricky bank shots, high-explosive warheads,
              even infrared heat-seekers. But mostly it was just bullets.<br> <br> That's generally how it's been in the real world, too. Most small-arms
              manufacturers reckon it's a good day if they can make a shoulder weapon
              which will shoot fairly ordinary bullets accurately and not need too
              much maintenance. Sometimes they can't manage even that. Generally
              speaking, even the most fashionably equipped soldiers and cops today
              are still armed with weapons which were on offer sixty years ago and
              more - assault rifles or carbines, submachineguns, low-velocity grenade
              launchers of one kind and another, light machine guns.<br> <br> <br> There is a bewildering array of portable missile and rocket launchers,
              but these are generally meant for shooting up aircraft, vehicles or
              buildings - not people. For that, you're normally still firing boring
              old kinetic energy bullets, devoid of any major differences from those
              of World War II and earlier. (One might say that nothing much has
              changed since the late 19th century, unless you happen to be a gun dork
              and up on all the intermediate-power cartridges guff.)<br> <br> <br> But those who like a bit of mad science fiction technology in their gun
              news will be pleased to hear that - according to reports - a
              long-stalled 1990s plan to kit out US soldiers with a truly wack new
              firearm has come back to life.<br> <br> <br> Essentially, the idea is to have a gun which shoots special, extra-big
              25mm slugs - sort of a cross between a normal bullet and a 40mm
              launched grenade. The projectile is thus big enough to put clever stuff
              in it, but small enough that a weapon carried by a normal person can
              shoot it a long way without the recoil knocking the user flat.
              (Everyone loves 40mm grenades, but they are so tubby that a shoulder
              launcher of reasonable weight and recoil can't throw them very fast -
              hence not very far either).<br> <br> <br> What you put in your big fat .98-calibre** slugs is a small HE-frag
              warhead - but that's not the clever bit. The clever bit is the
              electronic precision time fuse, which is set wirelessly by the gun's
              systems at the moment of firing. This means that the slug will explode
              at exactly the distance from the muzzle you want.<br> <br> <br> <em>Source: The Register UK., October 9, 2008</em></p>
