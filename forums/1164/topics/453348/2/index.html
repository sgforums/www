              same consideration? My answer is NO.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Discussions should continue with agreements such as the UN's
              1982 convention and the Asean code of conduct in dealing with China
              in 2002 should continue, to come up with new ideas for resolving
              the dispute.</p>
              <p>I won't be happy if the US were to leave Asia completely, that
              would means something goes wrong with the heads of those in the
              whitehouse, but that doesn't mean that we will have war immediately
              within the region when the US leave. </p>

              <p>I didn't see you ask both questions. No to the second question is obvious because Taiwan is much more important to China than North Korea. The first question is more of a yes, because not treating China as a military threat means letting its military gain superiority in the South China Sea, which is not an acceptable solution to the rest of Asia.</p>

              <p>If an arm conflict, whether it is with your own strength or that
                  of your bouncer, can force others to accept your point, then it
                  will be a matter of time when China would have to use force, which
                  they would be prepared to do, sacrificing a few hundreds warships,
                  in exchange for the sinking of One US aircraft carrier. You think
                  the US would be prepared to sacrifice the same. If the US were to
                  risk a nuclear war, which country would be prepared to take the
                  first hit? the Philippines, may be....</p>

              <p>You're saying that where the use of force is viable, it is a matter of time before China uses it. Am I reading you correctly?</p>
              <p>I wouldn't say the US is completely unwilling to lose one aircraft carrier. That mentality prevails in peace time. The US is unwilling to even stop trading with China, much less bear the economic cost of a cyber war with China.</p>
              <p>If it comes to a military showdown, it will be over Chinese military force being used with all of Asia ultimately at stake. The loss of a carrier will be an unprecendented but acceptable cost in the pursuit of such stakes.</p>
              <p>High as these stakes are, it will not be a war of national survival, and therefore not a nuclear war. Political leaders after all lead comfortable lives. What are you saying about the Philippines?</p>

              <p>Obama makes concessions to China like never before, but also supports rewriting USA's entire military doctrine for such a war should it come.

              but I don't agree with that statement. China could have a new revolution
               should the country becomes more like a Capitalist country again. Any

               I'm an not American but I can see clearly why the US are so concern 
              with the Chinese military buildup in this region. The Australians too 
              are concern because in happened to them during WW2 and the Japanese were
               right in front of their door step. Darwing was air raided and bombed. I
               know the Americans had sacrifed their young men lives in the pacific 
              region during WW2 and I know its their effort too that brought down the 
              Japanese to its knees.</p>
              <p>Lastly I know how it felt to lose a grandfather and uncles from both 
              sides of my late parents. I'm half Chinese and Malay. My maternal 
              grandfather and uncle were executed by the Japanese firing squad during 
              the Japanese Occupation of Singapore. My paternal uncle was forced to be
               enlisted into the Japanese Imperial Army or the family will be tortured
               and executed. At the close of WW2, he was send to either Peninsula 
              Malaya or Burma. After the war he did not returned to Singapore and was 
              givenup as dead. Nobody received any news about him though my paternal 
              grandmother and grandfather enquired officially about his whereabouts 
              during that time.</p>

              It depends on North Korea. They had sunked the South Korean Naval Ship. Then later they had opened fire upon South Korean soil...to test or provoked the South Korean people. The US had managed to restrain South Korean military from retaliation. There would be war again between North and South Korean if the US hadn't intervened. Just like the deceased former president of Iraq, Saddam Hussein, had done during the first Gulf War 1990 to 1991. Iraq had attacked and launched conventional scud missiles upon Israel to provoke and drag the Israelis into the Gulf War. The US had strongly advised Israelis to practise restrain and prevent them from retaliation. If the Israelis had retaliated it would have drag other Arab nations in the middle-east and the Moslems world into the Gulf War on Saddam Hussein side. 
              
              If THEY attack US Naval Fleet in this region. it will be WW3.

              Yes, South Korean was restrained from retaliation. Why do you think North Korea attacked South Korean?
              
              If all the ASEAN countries combined their naval fleet, its still very small compare to China. As you can see from the current news about spratly, China just refused to follow the international code of conduct inpertinence to territorial dispute in this region. So what is China trying to show the ASEAN countries here you think?
