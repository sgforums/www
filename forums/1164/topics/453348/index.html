              <p style="font-family: Arial, Helmet, Freesans, sans-serif; line-height: 18px; margin-bottom: 18px; font-size: 1.077em; text-rendering: auto; clear: left; text-align: -webkit-auto;"><span style="color: #333333;">He said that by </span><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">2020 about 60% of the US fleet would be deployed there, in the clearest indication yet of the new US strategy in Asia.</span></span></strong></p>
              <p style="font-family: Arial, Helmet, Freesans, sans-serif; line-height: 18px; margin-bottom: 18px; font-size: 1.077em; text-rendering: auto; clear: left; text-align: -webkit-auto;"><span style="color: #333333;">Mr Panetta told a regional security meeting in Singapore that</span><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #ff0000;"> the shift was not aiming to contain Chinese power.</span></span></strong></p>
              <p style="font-family: Arial, Helmet, Freesans, sans-serif; line-height: 18px; margin-bottom: 18px; font-size: 1.077em; text-rendering: auto; clear: left; text-align: -webkit-auto;"><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">Beijing has indicated it is unhappy with the US boosting its presence.</span></span></strong></p>
              <p style="color: #333333; font-family: Arial, Helmet, Freesans, sans-serif; line-height: 18px; margin-bottom: 18px; font-size: 1.077em; text-rendering: auto; clear: left; text-align: -webkit-auto;">Last November, President Barack Obama announced that the Asia-Pacific region was a "top priority" of US security policy.</p>
              <p style="color: #333333; font-family: Arial, Helmet, Freesans, sans-serif; line-height: 18px; margin-bottom: 18px; font-size: 1.077em; text-rendering: auto; clear: left; text-align: -webkit-auto;">His comments were seen as a challenge to China, which is striving to be the main regional power.</p>
              <p style="font-family: Arial, Helmet, Freesans, sans-serif; line-height: 18px; margin-bottom: 18px; font-size: 1.077em; text-rendering: auto; clear: left; text-align: -webkit-auto;"><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">"By 2020, the navy will reposture its forces from today's roughly 50-50% split between the Pacific and the Atlantic to about a 60-40 split between those oceans," Mr Panetta told the annual Shangri-La Dialogue conference.</span></span></strong></p>

              <p style="margin-bottom: 12px; font-size: 13px; text-rendering: auto; clear: left;">The US defence secretary is on a mission both to explain and reassure. Firstly to set out in more detail the practical implications of Washington's strategic re-balancing towards Asia and secondly to reassure America's allies in the region who wonder if it can really afford to fund this new strategy given the budgetary pressures at home.</p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 12px; font-size: 13px; text-rendering: auto; clear: left;">Mr Panetta also sought to play down any suggestion that Washington's new strategy was aimed at China.</p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 12px; font-size: 13px; text-rendering: auto; clear: left;">He stressed the need for closer military ties between China and the US - especially for understanding in the difficult areas of cybersecurity and outer space.</p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 12px; font-size: 13px; text-rendering: auto; clear: left;">However his support for a comprehensive new "rules-based" system to resolve competing territorial claims in the South China Sea will not go down well in Beijing.</p>

              <p id="story_continues_2" style="font-family: Arial, Helmet, Freesans, sans-serif; line-height: 18px; margin-bottom: 18px; font-size: 1.077em; text-rendering: auto; clear: left; text-align: -webkit-auto;"><span style="color: #333333;">"That will include</span><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #ff0000;"> six aircraft carriers in this region, a majority of our cruisers, destroyers, combat ships and submarines."</span></span></strong></p>
              <p style="color: #333333; font-family: Arial, Helmet, Freesans, sans-serif; line-height: 18px; margin-bottom: 18px; font-size: 1.077em; text-rendering: auto; clear: left; text-align: -webkit-auto;">Mr Panetta said the US would aim to increase the number and size of the training exercises it conducts alongside its allies in the region.</p>
              <p style="color: #333333; font-family: Arial, Helmet, Freesans, sans-serif; line-height: 18px; margin-bottom: 18px; font-size: 1.077em; text-rendering: auto; clear: left; text-align: -webkit-auto;">He said US budget problems and cut-backs would not stop the changes, adding that the US defence department had money in a five-year budget plan to achieve its goals.</p>
              <p style="color: #333333; font-family: Arial, Helmet, Freesans, sans-serif; line-height: 18px; margin-bottom: 18px; font-size: 1.077em; text-rendering: auto; clear: left; text-align: -webkit-auto;">"It will take years for these concepts, and many of the investments we are making, to be fully realised," he said.</p>
              <p style="color: #333333; font-family: Arial, Helmet, Freesans, sans-serif; line-height: 18px; margin-bottom: 18px; font-size: 1.077em; text-rendering: auto; clear: left; text-align: -webkit-auto;">"But make no mistake, in a steady, deliberate and sustainable way, the United States military is rebalancing and brings enhanced capabilities to this vital region."</p>
              <p style="color: #333333; font-family: Arial, Helmet, Freesans, sans-serif; line-height: 18px; margin-bottom: 18px; font-size: 1.077em; text-rendering: auto; clear: left; text-align: -webkit-auto;">China has long-running territorial disputes with allies of the US, including the Philippines, over island groupings in the South China Sea. In recent years it has grown more assertive on the issue.</p>
              <p style="color: #333333; font-family: Arial, Helmet, Freesans, sans-serif; line-height: 18px; margin-bottom: 18px; font-size: 1.077em; text-rendering: auto; clear: left; text-align: -webkit-auto;">An increased US presence in the region is likely to embolden those countries and irritate Beijing.</p>
              <p style="color: #333333; font-family: Arial, Helmet, Freesans, sans-serif; line-height: 18px; margin-bottom: 18px; font-size: 1.077em; text-rendering: auto; clear: left; text-align: -webkit-auto;">Mr Panetta played down any possible tensions and said he was looking forward to visiting China later this year.</p>
              <p style="color: #333333; font-family: Arial, Helmet, Freesans, sans-serif; line-height: 18px; margin-bottom: 18px; font-size: 1.077em; text-rendering: auto; clear: left; text-align: -webkit-auto;">"Some view the increased emphasis by the United States on the Asia-Pacific region as some kind of challenge to China," he said.</p>
              <p style="color: #333333; font-family: Arial, Helmet, Freesans, sans-serif; line-height: 18px; margin-bottom: 18px; font-size: 1.077em; text-rendering: auto; clear: left; text-align: -webkit-auto;">"I reject that view entirely. Our effort to renew and intensify our involvement in Asia is fully compatible with the development and growth of China. Indeed, increased US involvement in this region will benefit China as it advances our shared security and prosperity for the future."</p>
              <p style="color: #333333; font-family: Arial, Helmet, Freesans, sans-serif; line-height: 18px; margin-bottom: 18px; font-size: 1.077em; text-rendering: auto; clear: left; text-align: -webkit-auto;">In January, Chinese state media also said an increased US presence in the region could boost stability and prosperity.</p>
              <p style="color: #333333; font-family: Arial, Helmet, Freesans, sans-serif; line-height: 18px; margin-bottom: 18px; font-size: 1.077em; text-rendering: auto; clear: left; text-align: -webkit-auto;">But it warned the US against "flexing its muscles" and said any US militarism could create ill will and "endanger peace".</p>
              <p style="color: #333333; font-family: Arial, Helmet, Freesans, sans-serif; line-height: 18px; margin-bottom: 18px; font-size: 1.077em; text-rendering: auto; clear: left; text-align: -webkit-auto;">Mr Panetta is currently on a nine-day tour of Asia which will include visits to Vietnam and India.</p>

              <p style="margin-bottom: 20px; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 15px; ">SINGAPORE, June 2 (Xinhua) -- The United States will try to improve the strategic trust with China by strengthening military- to-military exchanges, while shifting some of its warships to the Pacific over the coming years, U.S. Defense Secretary Leon Panetta said on Saturday.</p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 20px; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 15px; ">Outlining details of the U.S. plan for its "rebalancing" act towards Asia Pacific in a speech at the Shangri-La Dialogue, Panetta said the United States recognizes the importance of the relationship between the United States and China, not only between the militaries but also in diplomacy and the economic development.</p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 20px; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 15px; ">"We are not naive about this relationship, and neither is China. We both understand the differences we have. We both understand the conflicts we have. But we also both understand that there really is no other alternative for both of us but to engage and to improve our communications and to improve our military-to-military relationships," he told defense ministers, senior defense officials and scholars at the multilateral forum.</p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 20px; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 15px; ">Panetta said it is natural for the two countries to have ups and downs in the relations between their militaries. The United States is clear-eyed about the challenges but there will also be opportunities from closer relationship. The two countries have common challenges in areas like fighting piracy, too.</p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 20px; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 15px; ">"I am personally committed to building a healthy, stable, reliable and continuous military-to-military relationship with China," he said.</p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 20px; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 15px; ">Panetta said he might be visiting China later in the summer, and that he was hoping for visits by some of the U.S. military commanders to China to help improve the communication in regard to what the United States is doing in the Pacific.</p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 20px; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 15px; ">Panetta outlined some of the details of the U.S. "rebalancing" plan in the speech at the Shangri-La Dialogue, saying that U.S. military presence in the Pacific will also increase.</p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 20px; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 15px; ">The number and sizes of the military exercises in the Pacific involving the United States will also increase, he said.</p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 20px; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 15px; ">"By 2020, the Navy will re-posture its forces from today's roughly 50-50 percent split between the Pacific and the Atlantic to about a 60-40 split between those oceans. That will include six aircraft carriers, a majority of our cruisers, destroyers, littoral combat ships, and submarines," Panetta said.</p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 20px; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 15px; ">The defense chief said the United States will make efforts to strengthen its partnerships with its allies and partner countries such as Indonesia, Malaysia, Vietnam and New Zealand.</p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 20px; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 15px; ">Despite fiscal pressures, the United States is designing a strategy to maintain the strongest military in the world, which will be smaller, leaner but agile and more advanced technologically, he said. It will replace some of its older Navy ships with over 40 far more advanced ships over the next five years.</p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 20px; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 15px; ">Panetta also urged restraint in the South China Sea disputes, saying that the United States is against provocation and that the disputes should be resolved through diplomatic efforts.</p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 20px; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 15px; ">The Shangri-La Dialogue, or the 11th Asia Security Summit, is a multilateral forum organized by the London-based think tank International Institute for Strategic Studies. The participants also engage in diplomacy and exchange their views on issues and developments in regional security.</p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 20px; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 15px; ">Panetta left Washington on Wednesday for a tour in the region that also includes stops in Vietnam and India.</p>

              Actually, this is a con news article.
              
              Why?
              
              Because the US Navy is already 50% in the Pacific, their +10% is not really a transfer, it's just adding the new LCSs to the area. Which is a auto given, what "litoral" area is there in the Atlantic side of the US continent that isn't already US owned? Brazil? Argentina? And of course the Falklands (British). Put the LCS there for fuck?
              
              Only really big difference is probably a carrier, to guard the new Marine base in Australia.
              
              Not really news.

              <p>That's already a big part of the ASW capability. For one the MH-60 doesn't have a VDS, for another the LCS itself is needed to tie in with other assets.</p>

              <p style="margin-top: 15px; margin-bottom: 0px; list-style-type: none; list-style-image: none; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; color: #666666; font-size: 14px; line-height: normal;">Hu said the world economy maintains a general trend of recovery but still with uncertainty and instability. China hopes the G20 members continue to uphold the spirit of cooperation and "in the same boat" to work for growth, stability and employment.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 15px; margin-bottom: 0px; list-style-type: none; list-style-image: none; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; color: #666666; font-size: 14px; line-height: normal;">He also called on the G20 members to jointly inject impetus to recovery and growth of the world economy.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 15px; margin-bottom: 0px; list-style-type: none; list-style-image: none; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; color: #666666; font-size: 14px; line-height: normal;">For his part, Calderon said Mexico attaches importance to China's propositions and role in the G20. He wished to cooperate with China to ensure that the G20 summit will make progress on promoting strong, sustainable and balanced economic growth and advancing reform of the international financial system.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 15px; margin-bottom: 0px; list-style-type: none; list-style-image: none; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; color: #666666; font-size: 14px; line-height: normal;">Calderon also expressed his readiness to work with China to safeguard the interests of developing countries and emerging economies.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 15px; margin-bottom: 0px; list-style-type: none; list-style-image: none; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; color: #666666; font-size: 14px; line-height: normal;">Hu said since Calderon became president, he has led the Mexican government and people to actively address challenges posed by globalization and the international financial crisis.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 15px; margin-bottom: 0px; list-style-type: none; list-style-image: none; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; color: #666666; font-size: 14px; line-height: normal;">He expressed his gladness and appreciation of the remarkable achievements made by Mexico in social and economic development over the years.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 15px; margin-bottom: 0px; list-style-type: none; list-style-image: none; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; color: #666666; font-size: 14px; line-height: normal;">Calderon said the Chinese president's attendance at the G20 summit is very significant because China has an increasingly important status on the global stage.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 15px; margin-bottom: 0px; list-style-type: none; list-style-image: none; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; color: #666666; font-size: 14px; line-height: normal;">Hu's visit will contribute greatly to boosting and deepening the Mexico-China relations, he added.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 15px; margin-bottom: 0px; list-style-type: none; list-style-image: none; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; color: #666666; font-size: 14px; line-height: normal;">This year marks the 40th anniversary of the establishment of diplomatic ties between China and Mexico. Hu said links between the two countries have entered a new stage of mature, steady and extensive growth.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 15px; margin-bottom: 0px; list-style-type: none; list-style-image: none; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; color: #666666; font-size: 14px; line-height: normal;">The two countries established a strategic partnership in 2003. During Calderon's visit to China in 2008, the two countries reached a series of consensus and decided to set up a strategic dialogue mechanism, Hu said.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 15px; margin-bottom: 0px; list-style-type: none; list-style-image: none; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; color: #666666; font-size: 14px; line-height: normal;">The mechanism of permanent binational commission has become more mature and complete over the years, and played an important role in guiding the friendly cooperation in various areas between the two sides, he said.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 15px; margin-bottom: 0px; list-style-type: none; list-style-image: none; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; color: #666666; font-size: 14px; line-height: normal;">The two countries have already developed two joint action plans through the mechanism, Hu said, adding that the fifth meeting of the cooperation commission held in China this year had achieved major results.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 15px; margin-bottom: 0px; list-style-type: none; list-style-image: none; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; color: #666666; font-size: 14px; line-height: normal;">Hu said China has already become the second largest trade partner of Mexico, while Mexico is the second largest trade partner of China in Latin America and also has the most frequent cultural exchanges with China.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 15px; margin-bottom: 0px; list-style-type: none; list-style-image: none; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; color: #666666; font-size: 14px; line-height: normal;">The two sides have maintained sound communication and cooperation on major regional and international issues, Hu said.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 15px; margin-bottom: 0px; list-style-type: none; list-style-image: none; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; color: #666666; font-size: 14px; line-height: normal;">Hu pointed out that under the current international situation of complex changes, deepening strategic cooperation between China and Mexico is of great significance. China is ready to work with Mexico to advance bilateral cooperation in a long-term, healthy and stable way.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 15px; margin-bottom: 0px; list-style-type: none; list-style-image: none; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; color: #666666; font-size: 14px; line-height: normal;">At the meeting, Hu also put forward a four-point proposal on advancing China-Mexico ties.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 15px; margin-bottom: 0px; list-style-type: none; list-style-image: none; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; color: #666666; font-size: 14px; line-height: normal;">Firstly, Hu said, the two countries should plan for the future of bilateral links from a strategic height and with a long-term view. The two sides should use all forms of political mechanism to enhance mutual trust and support each other on issues of their core interests and major concern.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 15px; margin-bottom: 0px; list-style-type: none; list-style-image: none; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; color: #666666; font-size: 14px; line-height: normal;">Secondly, the two sides should tap the potential and expand the channels of cooperation on the basis of their own specific development strategy by increasing reciprocal investment and stepping up cooperation in the areas of science, technology, agriculture, infrastructure development and tourism, he said, calling on both sides to promote bilateral trade in a healthy and balanced way.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 15px; margin-bottom: 0px; list-style-type: none; list-style-image: none; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; color: #666666; font-size: 14px; line-height: normal;">Thirdly, the two sides should strengthen cultural and educational cooperation and advance friendly exchanges between their political parties, legislatures, local governments, media and non-government organizations in a bid to enhance mutual understanding.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 15px; margin-bottom: 0px; list-style-type: none; list-style-image: none; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; color: #666666; font-size: 14px; line-height: normal;">Fourthly, the two sides should strengthen coordination within the multilateral frameworks of the UN, G20 and APEC. The two countries should cooperate closely on major international issues, safeguard the common interests of developing countries and join effort to build a harmonious world.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 15px; margin-bottom: 0px; list-style-type: none; list-style-image: none; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; color: #666666; font-size: 14px; line-height: normal;">Calderon said Mexico and China, both as developing countries, should cooperate closely and advance bilateral links on the basis of mutual respect, equality and mutual benefits. Leaders of the two countries have also maintained frequent contact and the permanent binational commission has promoted trade and economic cooperation.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 15px; margin-bottom: 0px; list-style-type: none; list-style-image: none; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; color: #666666; font-size: 14px; line-height: normal;">Referring to the upcoming summit, Hu said in an interview with leading Mexican newspaper Reforma that the G20 members have to sustain and strengthen the "hard-won" momentum of economic recovery.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 15px; margin-bottom: 0px; list-style-type: none; list-style-image: none; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; color: #666666; font-size: 14px; line-height: normal;">"The world economy is now on the path of recovery and the prospect of economic growth is improving to some extent," Hu said, warning that such recovery is still facing unpredictability.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 15px; margin-bottom: 0px; list-style-type: none; list-style-image: none; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; color: #666666; font-size: 14px; line-height: normal;">"In the current world economic environment, the G20 members should work together in difficult times and pursue win-win cooperation," he said.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 15px; margin-bottom: 0px; list-style-type: none; list-style-image: none; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; color: #666666; font-size: 14px; line-height: normal;">"In Los Cabos, I look forward to exploring with leaders of other G20 members ways to promote world economic stability, recovery and growth."</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 15px; margin-bottom: 0px; list-style-type: none; list-style-image: none; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; color: #666666; font-size: 14px; line-height: normal;">After a visit to Denmark, Hu arrived in Los Cabos on Saturday to attend the seventh summit of the G20 which will be held on Monday and Tuesday.</p>

              <p>I concur with you on that part of a miscalculation by the Imperial Japan. They desperately needed the oil resources for their war with China and Korea. The US and their allies were going to enforce embargo of oil supplies on Imperial Japan unless the Japanese cease their war campaign in China, Korea and also Indochina. The Japanese saw that they were unable to continue their conquest and they knew too sooner or later they would need to fight the Americans and its allies.</p>

              <p>It seems the second cold war era is ongoing now. This time its between China and US. China is a big threat to countries within this region militarily. Should China change its stance on its deplomatic and political arena with countries within this region there is going to be a great mayhem. I'm just wondering whether many world leaders realized that the foreign investments they sow in China actually helps to make China military more powerful. Let me create a scenario for you.</p>
              <p>Should North Korea invade South Korea, China may get involve this time since China is a strong ally to North Korea. China will invade Taiwan. South Korea and Taiwan are strong allies to the US. The US and its allies will get involve in the war too. And the best I can see here, North Korea would possibly launch a surprise nuclear attacks with its nuclear long range missiles on the US strategic military bases within this region and the pacific region to cripple US military supremacy.  That is quite a stage to start WW3.</p>
              <p>The Chinese race population of the world would be divided here. Who are they going to support. China or the US and its allies? If this happens, what is Singapore diplomatic and political stance on this issue?</p>

Resources were part of the reasons for their conquest and it was rubber that they were after, for making tires for vehicles. The reason for the conquest was colonization, chase out the europeans, make everybody speak japanese.</p>

Big countries have big military and small countries got small military, is big always a threat to small? If the american change its stance the world is a big mayhem.</p>

              <p>I don't see how South China Sea claim is non-threatening. Or how it is justified. If China is going to arm up over the issue and cruise the islands with carriers and LPDs, South East Asia should either arm themselves or ask the US for help.</p>

              <p>There are two differences:</p>
              <p>China's claim is less reasonable. The Chinese claim is to draw a 
                  U-shaped line into the South China Sea, claim every island within it, 
                  draw 12 miles of territorial waters and 200 miles of EEZ around each and
                   claim them too. Most of these islands are further from China than any 
                  claimant country. Is this similar to what Singapore and Malaysia did?</p>
              <p>There is also the threat of force. Singapore and Malaysia continued to patrol their own islands. We never started chasing each other's ships and planes away or letting commercial ships go into each other's territory. In fact there was never a military build up on the islands. China has done both.</p>
              <p>If your beef is against the US, I would be most happy for the US to leave, if every country that has a more reasonable claim can afford an arsenal of Brahmos or carrier-killing missiles of the type that China is buying.</p>

              <p>My question is whether considering China a threat will lead to a solution to the dispute, should the issues of North Korea and the cross straits relationship between China and Taiwan be put into the same consideration? My answer is NO.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Discussions should continue with agreements such as the UN's 1982 convention and the Asean code of conduct in dealing with China in 2002 should continue, to come up with new ideas for resolving the dispute.</p>
              <p>I won't be happy if the US were to leave Asia completely, that would means something goes wrong with the heads of those in the whitehouse, but that doesn't mean that we will have war immediately within the region when the US leave. </p>

              <p>There are two differences:</p>
              <p>China's claim is less reasonable. The Chinese claim is to draw a
              U-shaped line into the South China Sea, claim every island within
              it, draw 12 miles of territorial waters and 200 miles of EEZ around
              each and claim them too. Most of these islands are further from
              China than any claimant country. Is this similar to what Singapore
              and Malaysia did?</p>
              <p>There is also the threat of force. Singapore and Malaysia
              continued to patrol their own islands. We never started chasing
              each other's ships and planes away or letting commercial ships go
              into each other's territory. In fact there was never a military
              build up on the islands. China has done both.</p>
              <p>If your beef is against the US, I would be most happy for the US
              to leave, if every country that has a more reasonable claim can
              afford an arsenal of Brahmos or carrier-killing missiles of the

              <p>everybody's claim has some basis, but obviously there is no basis that is accepted by all, who is to say whose claim is more reasonable? China and Vietnam both based their claim on history which is something Malaysia, Philippines and Brunei don't have, but they have their basis. </p>
              <p>If an arm conflict, whether it is with your own strength or that of your bouncer, can force others to accept your point, then it will be a matter of time when China would have to use force, which they would be prepared to do, sacrificing a few hundreds warships, in exchange for the sinking of One US aircraft carrier. You think the US would be prepared to sacrifice the same. If the US were to risk a nuclear war, which country would be prepared to take the first hit? the Philippines, may be....</p>
              <p>China would not want a war at its door step, the US has been fighting war far far away, from its own territory. History tells us very clearly.</p>
