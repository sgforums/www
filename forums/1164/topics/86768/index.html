Go see a specialist about it, get letters for a downgrade etc. Also, make a case and complain to your Member of Parliment.

            <div class='col-md body'>Legally, confirm if you've officially volunteered, or "got volunteered" to extend your reservist stint. There's this SAF scheme called ROVERS, or Reservists On Voluntary Extended Reserve Service, which requires an initial 3-year commitment for the qualified who're "keen enough"; find out if your status comes under this category. You may be able to opt-out if you weren't partial to making the decision yourself in the 1st place.<br><br>I don't think a medical downgrade can achieve what you want, unless it's for something truly crippling. Presumably you're already Category Z, in which case they'll likely reclassify your PES status &amp; let you continue your military appointment  - i.e. they're separate issues &amp; not necessarily causal-linked. I mean, they don't even redeploy soldiers with hypertension to the reservist CQ/rations people nowdays (as they would during NSF). Instead, they're excused from IPPT, but otherwise carry on as usual with their kakis trying to lessen the physical workload &amp; ensuring they take their medicine.<br><br>I think income ceiling can a bigger "deterrent" by comparison; do you make enough money that the SAF couldn't affordably call you back unless they have to?<br><br>Continue pushing both your senior officer &amp; employer, in order to concretely reflect your unhappiness. If your boss values your work, he'll sign countless deferment requests if need be - &amp; the 1st line of obstacle isn't actually MINDEF or the SAF, but your CO or equivalent (who'll acede to or reject your deferment). Who knows, there may not be an alternate make-up stint available if you're a KAH with a higher-level outfit.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Ah-hah, the picture's clearer. I figured you would have to be an S3/XO 1st - are you one already? - deputizing behind a CO before succeeding him. That was the experience within my Arty unit.<br><br>It was also from a couple of recycled KAHs (my CO &amp; RSM) that I learnt informally about the ROVERS scheme. FYI They elected not to "overstay" beyond their extended obligations, certainly not past age 40+. My CO, in particular, found it increasingly tough juggling both careers; his MNC job was generous with time but he found it too stressful to spend 40+ days each year attending staff-officer courses along with the regular ICTs.<br><br>Even if the scheme doesn't apply to you now, it soon will &amp; I recommend you familiarize yourself with all of its parameters. Here's a start: http://www.mindef.gov.sg/display.asp?number=549<br><br>My CO &amp; RSM were noticeably excused from IPPT all the way too - dunno if it was due to downgrade or Cat Z/non-FFI clearance -  but otherwise "carried on as usual." That's why I forewarned a reclassified PES status may not get what you really want. Maybe there's a different standard with other combat formations, but in Arty there's no hope for a downgraded reservist gunner for a switch in vocation/appointment, as long as he can moderately sweat as he would as a civilian.<br><br>I doubt your MP can help you much either. They have some influence but tend to be too pro-establishment &amp; cognizant of the SAF's needs. It's likely they'll bear peer pressure on you to conform instead, even as you attempt to get them to support your petition.<br><br>No go with income ceiling? The only other plausibly-effective alternative I can think of is an overseas job posting, with concrete evidence that you'll be based in another country (even Malaysia). I dunno how hardball they'll be with approving your exit permit - this area is where your MP can truly help you, for once - but logic says they can only appeal to your sense of nationalism/duty as a last resort. You have the prerogative to respond if it comes down to this.<br><br>A word, though: it's almost certain they'll hoping on utilizing you again, esp. for a SCSC-trained officer. In other words, you'll likely be put on a holding list to await your return. Does that mean you'll liable until age 50? I don't think it'll strictly apply, if the ROVERS scheme counts for anything. That's why I suggest you read up on everything you can about the latter.</div>

Again, i would like to stress that money is not the problem; hence if anyone has some brillant ideas, i am ready to discuss.<br><br>I have thusfar figured out from your comments that the following few maybe good downgrade reasons :<br><br>1) Persistant pain in the leg joints; esp so after long walks and strenous exercise.<br>2) Migrane strikes under field conditions.<br>3) Persistant pain in the spine after long walks and carrying loads.<br><br>Guys, any more ideas will be very very welcomed!!</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I get it now - your status must be one of those recyled KAHs. Whereas your old unit would've been redeployed to PDF (or its equivalent) upon finishing its training cycle, you still have enough NS liability left to be mustered out to help break in a new outfit.<br><br>Technically, it's 13 years for general NSmen but 16 for KAHs, so you'll likely attend 2-3 ICTs with your new unit (after your SCSC course) before the SAF contact you about volunteering under ROVERS.<br><br>May I ask which combat formation you're in? My guess is you won't escape the CO promotion with a medical downgrade unless you're infantry or equivalent (at least). You can try your luck - by all means, go for a full fitness check - but there's no point in keng-ing unless you'll willing to risk your civilian reputation as well. It's gonna be a quite high-level appointment after all, &amp; the SAF shall accord your profile reevaluation with equal seriousness.<br><br>Why not take it one step at a time instead? I dunno specifically what the peer pressure to re-upp will be like when the situation arises, but until then it's only a few years to the end of your 16-year window.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Moxie,<br><br>1. I am in the SIR; ie a lot of walking and field activities<br><br>2. You are right abt my situation. Current BN is standing down and they want me to take on a new BN; which i thot is very unfair... after all i have serve and contributed in the past 10 years.<br><br>3. Frankly, there is not "bad reputation" of downgrading and escape CO appt. It is all dirt and no glory; in the 1st place, what glory is there to serve SAF??? I know of so many senior officers, LTC rank, who were forced to retire at age of 45 yrs old. Some became "supervisors" of security companies and i know of one who end up driving TAXI. In the commercial world, people accord repute to you wealth and power. Ask yourself, which name is more sounding in Singapore : Tommy Goh or BG Steven Wong (huh.. .who is he??)<br><br>It is a pity, but it is the flawed system which make a mockery out of the whole thing.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Michaelteo, I sympathize with your predicament but now that the facts are established, I don't think you're in that great a quagmire that you made it out to be. Had me misconstrued there for a while ....<br><br>Basically, you can't escape these 2 truths:<br><br>- you're still on operational-ready status, unlike your other reservist cohorts who're being "stood down" &amp; being reposted to, in reality, a non-active unit (PDF). Yes, that's depressing - blame it on the roll of the dice, that's all. It's not really different from a corporal who finished 6 ICTs after joining in midway, then had to serve 3 more ICTs with another fresh BN due to his NSman liability.<br><br>- KAHs are supposed to go for upgrading courses, period. Medical downgrading isn't going to change this, unless your fitness's reclassified down to PES C9L2 or lower (I think).<br><br>Accordingly, I don't think you should think too far ahead &amp; then calculate on a risky, but ultimately ill-advised move. In some ways, I'm speculating instead that you can actually maneuver around with the hand you've been dealt with.<br><br>1stly, going on Medical Board takes time; I don't think you can just make an ad-hoc phone call for a review. Rather, you'll have to report sick in your next call-up (ege. SCSC course, or FFI checkup) &amp; then ask the MO to forward your documents. In other words, there's a bureaucratic process to go through, &amp; they'll formally board you when they're ready. Until that date, it's likely you won't be excused from your present circumstances (as long as it's not overly physical-taxing). By all means, see how far you can get out of this means, but don't expect the moon immediately.<br><br>2ndly, it's a bit SAF-backstabbing to suggest this but I think aiming for a deferment can help your case big-time. Think about it: you only have X years left in your 16-year window, &amp; SCSC courses aren't organized impromptu. How many chances left to go for CO training if you can get yourself "postponed" from one preparatory attendance due to civilian factors?<br><br>[Skip the next part if you're already posted out or on a holding list, completely at the mercy of where the SAF could send you to.]<br><br>3rdly, I dunno if it's deliberate but my own experience indicates that it's both prevalent &amp; preferable that an unit's KAHs recyle on TOGETHER to the new outfit, rather than breaking up the team &amp; leaving each on his own. Thus, your CO's longevity can affect your expected promotion, in the sense that he may not formally "stand down" (&amp; may even re-upp under ROVERS) until your own window is ending. There's a chance you may never climb higher than S3/2IC despite your new qualifications, or do CO for just 1-2 ICTs before the ROVERS people contact you. [As for suddenly being faced with 3+ week ICTs again, see "Truth 1" above.]<br><br>Take it one step at a time. Even if your worst nightmare comes true &amp; you end up commanding a SIR unit, there's always the "delegate-down" leadership style - instead of hands-on - though you'll probably be stuck with a "condemned" rep ~smile~<br><br>Don't think I can help much more; maybe other posters can offer something ...</div>
