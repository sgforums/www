Obviously, it is in the United States' interest to see as many of partners and allies around the world operate with American weapons systems, so that if they are operating in the region, in terms of strict military operations, exercises or any other humanitarian operations, it is far more effective for the Americans to work with those forces. So this is part and parcel of that strategy irrespective of the industrial benefits that accrue to the Americans, there are significant operational benefits that are accrued to it when they work with American weapons systems. </strong><br><br>And as you talk about the issue of interoperability with the US forces for coalition operations, how does the North Korea proposed nuclear weapons program issue factor into the US' proposed weapons and aircraft sales?<br><br><strong>PM: I'm not sure that there is a strict relationship between the decision to go with the F-15 variant here. However, it does bear some interesting examples. In particular, the Koreans are operating a variant of the F-15 or will be operating a variant of the F-15 in the future. And obviously, if Singapore were to become involved in the conflict on the Korean Peninsula, in support of American and Korean security, then it would be in a much better position to contribute in a more significant fashion to air operations. </strong><br><br>Under the proposed weapons and aircraft transaction with Singapore by the United States, some of the weapons included in the sale are Advanced Medium Range Air-to-Air Missiles, Joint Direct Attack Munition, Joint Standoff Weapons etc. Under what circumstances are these defense mechanisms of the weapons used?<br><br><strong>PM: The types of weapons that are being acquired, or being under discussions of being acquired, in particular the Joint Direct Attack Munition and the Joint Standoff Weapons are both long range, precision guided munitions, and in particular, the AGM 154A Joint Standoff Weapon is one which drops multiple bomblets out of it. So it is extremely useful in taking out large concentrations of troops and armor. So this is an important contribution, from Singapore's part, if it found itself working with the United States and the Koreans in any sort of contingency within Korea. </strong><br><br>How will the proposed transaction of weapons and aircraft to Singapore by the United States contribute to the Republic's efforts in maintaining both aviation and maritime security in the Malacca Straits?<br><br><strong>PM: Well, the types of systems that we are talking about here in terms of the F-15, the Joint Standoff Weapons, the Joint Direct Attack Munitions probably will not have a direct role in contributing the recent agreement signed by Singapore, Indonesia and Malaysia. In that respect, the current weapons system such as the E2 Hawk Eyes that Singapore operates in terms of control of air space would be far more effective in maintaining aviation security. It is possible that an F-15 might be used to investigate suspicious air contact and ultimately may shoot it down, but in that respect, the F-16s would also be contributing to that particular contingency. And the types of weapons that we're looking at is that Singapore is looking to acquiring with the F-15s at the moment probably would not be the ones used to shoot down any aviation threats, maybe except the AIM 9X sidewinders. Again, a lot of these things are hitting the fly with a very large hammer, there are more effective ways in terms of providing aviation security. Obviously, these things all help, but with the economy of resources, it is more likely that the air force would choose to deploy other assets in contributing to that particular mission. </strong><br><br>Dr Paul Mitchell from at the Institute of Defense and Strategic Studies in Singapore.

The estimated cost is $741 million.<br><br>Singapore has requested a competition between U.S. contractors and foreign competitors for an aircraft program. If Singapore selects the F-15 aircraft, the aircraft and engines will be purchased commercially, for which there would be an eventual 36(c) notification of the commercial sale. This proposed sale includes the weapons and logistics support for the F-15 aircraft.<br><br>This proposed sale will contribute to the foreign policy and national security of the United States by helping to improve the security of a friendly country that has been, and continues to be, an important force for economic progress in Southeast Asia.<br><br>This proposed sale will provide Singapore with a credible self-defense capability that will deter aggression in the region and ensure interoperability with U.S. forces for coalition operations. Current U.S. Government policy is to enhance and strengthen our relationship with Singapore and this proposed sale will bring our two militaries closer together. Other countries in the region already or will soon possess this capability. Singapore needs these munitions to modernize its defensive capability, increase interoperability with U.S. forces, and provide a viable deterrent force in protection of vital ports and waterways. Singapore will use these munitions in defense of its sovereignty, or as part of an international coalition. These munitions will significantly improve its military capability by providing an intermediate-range anti-aircraft capability. Singapore is a modern, high-tech nation that can absorb these weapons into its armed forces.<br><br>The proposed sale of this equipment and support will not affect the basic military balance in the region.<br><br>The principal contractors will be Raytheon Missile System Corporation of Tucson, Arizona and Boeing Integrated Defense Solutions of St. Louis. There are no known offset agreements proposed in connection with this potential sale.<br><br>There will be up to 10 U.S. Government personnel and 10 contractor representatives for two-week intervals annually to participate in program management and technical reviews.<br><br>There will be no adverse impact on U.S. defense readiness as a result of this proposed sale.<br><br>This notice of a potential sale is required by law; it does not mean that the sale has been concluded.<br><br>-30-<br><br>Edit: Link corrected.</div>
