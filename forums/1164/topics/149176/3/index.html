Silver bullet in the form of the Derby?</div></blockquote>nope, my idea of a silver bullet would be a combination of systems, ECMs, wild weasel equipment and other stuff, (recall the humps on our viper Ds ? .. ) and more weaponary hardware of course, i won't be surprised that if shit happens a lot of hardware that we've never seen before appears, i'm thinking python IVs and yes, the derby perhaps, but also a lot more guided munitions, maybe the harpoons for the fokkers would "transform" into SLAMs for the fast jets ... more standoff weapons like popeyes maybe .... HARMS ... or even harpy drones ....<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I think in the USAF vs IAF air combat exercise, the both parties involved did not really use the BVR combat. Instead, USAF and IAF are training on close-in dog fight. In a realistic air combat situation, I believe the USAF F15s would have top hand in BVR combat given its advanced ECCM, ECM and missile seeker technologies. The IAF Sukkoi fighters would edge out the F15 in the close-in dog fights.<br><br>The F15s coupled with the AMRAAM or Python 4 would be the deadliest combi in BVR arena today. furthermore, USAF had also been planning for a major upgrade on their existing F15E with 2D thrust vectoring engines just like the F22 (by that time should have 3D thrust vectoring liao).<br><br>If we look at the Rafale fighter, the Taiwanese had just complaint on the high maintenance cost of the Mirage 2000-5 in their air force. The cost for running 1 mirage fighter can be as high as 500% more than the typical upkeeping cost of F16. Despite F15 is not cheap, also required a lot of maintenance for their engines and radar, we can always draw the spares from the USAF inventories READILY at maybe a very reasonable price...<br><br>Only when the maintenance cost could be control, then we could afford to allow our pilot to clock for more flying hours in the sky in this era of high fuel price.</div>
