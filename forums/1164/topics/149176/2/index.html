The total value, if all options are exercised, could be as high as $741 million. Given that:<br><br><strong><br>* Singapore does not currently fly F-15 aircraft (it flies F-16s, F/RF-5s, and A-4SUs)<br><br>* The F-15E Strike Eagle was named to an April/05 shortlist with Dassault's Rafale for Singapore's $1 billion A-4SU fighter replacement contract<br><br>* Closer U.S. military ties in recent years are expected to give the F-15E a slight edge; and<br><br>* The recently-retired head of U.S. Pacific Command was honored at almost the same time with Singapore's Meritorious Service Medal - Military<br></strong><br><br>...the natural question is whether the Government of Singapore has made or is very close to making a decision regarding its future fighter purchase.<br><br><img src="http://www.defenseindustrydaily.com/images/ORD_AGM-154_JSOW.jpg"><br>AGM-154 JSOW<br><br>The proposed deal also highlights other trends.<br><br>The equipment requested by Singapore was diverse, but many are among the most advanced in the U.S. arsenal. These weapons themselves are not definitive with respect to the fighter contract, however, as all of them could also be carried by F-16s.<br><br><strong><br>* 24 Link 16 Multifunctional Information Distribution System/Low Volume Terminals (Fighter Data Link Terminals); see this DID article for an explanation of this important piece of equipment, and note that the upcoming fighter contract is for around 20 planes.<br><br>* 200 AIM-120C Advanced Medium Range Air-to-Air Missiles (AMRAAM) and 6 CATM-120C AMRAAM Captive Air Training (CAT) Missiles. The AIM-120C is America's most advanced medium range air-air missile.<br><br>* 200 AIM-9X Sidewinder Missiles; and 24 AIM-9X Sidewinder Captive Air Training and Dummy Missiles. The AIM-9X is the most recent version of the short range Sidewinder air-air missile, and it has just started to enter service with U.S. fighters. It was designed to be competitive with missiles like the British ASRAAM, French Mica, Russian AA-11, German/European IRIS-T, and Israeli Python 4.<br><br>* 50 MK-82 GBU-38 Joint Direct Attack Munitions (JDAM) w/BLU-111 warhead; plus 100 KMU-556 GBU-31 JDAM Tail Kit Assemblies, that can turn regular bombs into Global Positioning System guided JDAMs.<br><br>* 30 AGM-154A-1 Joint Standoff Weapons w/BLU-111; and 30 AGM-154C Joint Standoff Weapons. These are GPS-guided glide bombs with a range of 75km.<br><br>* 44 AN/AVS-9(V) Night Vision Goggles.<br><br>* 300,000 20mm Practice Round Cartridges. Note that the Rafale uses a 30mm cannon, but F-16s and F-5s both use 20mm Vulcan cannon.<br><br>* 4 MK-82 and MK-84 "dumb" bomb practice trainers<br></strong><br><br>The principal contractors will be Raytheon Missile System Corporation of Tucson, AZ and Boeing Integrated Defense Solutions of St. Louis, MO. There will be up to 10 U.S. Government personnel and 10 contractor representatives for two-week intervals annually to participate in program management and technical reviews, and there are no known offset agreements proposed in connection with this potential sale.<br><br>With these weapons, Singapore continues its military modernization by adding transformational communications and precision strike capabilities. It also enhances its interoperability with both the USA and Australia, whose military cooperation have become more important as pan-Islamic movements target the regions and pirate activities continue to rise around the Straits of Malacca. The DSCA also noted that:<br><br>"Singapore has requested a competition between U.S. contractors and foreign competitors for an aircraft program. If Singapore selects the F-15 aircraft, the aircraft and engines will be purchased commercially, for which there would be an eventual 36Â© notification of the commercial sale. This proposed sale includes the weapons and logistics support for the F-15 aircraft."<br><br><img src="http://www.defenseindustrydaily.com/images/AIR_Rafale_lg.jpg"><br>Dassault Rafale<br><br>In response to queries on Aug 24/05, Singapore's Defense Ministry said that is still evaluating U.S. and French fighter jets and has yet to choose either of them for upgrading the country's warplanes. The government hasn't said when a decision would be made, either.<br><br><a href="http://www.defenseindustrydaily.com/2005/04/singapore-drops-eurofighter-from-critical-contract/index.php" rel="nofollow">See DID's overview</a> for more background on Singapore's $1 billion fighter contract and why it's significant.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>right now, the French and Thales are willing to offer 100% tech cooperation on the AESA - which is one of our biggest priorities. gives the Rafale an advantage.<br><br>that is not the case with the F-15T, there are still a lot of US tech transfer restrictions. however, i believe if the US offer us substantial transfer of AESA tech, F-15T will take the deal. US AESA is still the most advanced.<br><br>don't forget, american political pressure isn't going to work on us. it didn't spare michael fay the rotan, and neither is it going to affect our selection - we will pick the best plane for our needs, pure and simple. we are famous worldwide for that.<br><br>buying the rafale will also reduce our dependence on the US for fighter aircraft. always good to diversify your fighter supplier base in case relations go sour.<br><br>well, MINDEF announced the deadline is next month. not long more to wait! Dassault and Boeing are probably throwing their final sweeteners now, and we will know the decision in the coming weeks.</div>
