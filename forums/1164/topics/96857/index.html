            <div class='col-md body'>Arguments in another thread that went out of topic prompted this -<br><br>Officers versus Senior NCOs<br><br>As the opposing camps had stated, there are good and bad officers AND Senior NCOs.   I have seen them all, good and bad officers in my battalion, good and bad Senior NCOs (i.e. those holding CSM/BSM appointments and up).<br><br>In my battery, all officers were respected except for the Battery 2IC, a young national service guy who was given the appointment immediately after his commission.   He was not particular competent and liked to pull rank.   The BSM on the other hand, was a regular and maybe 10 years older and much more experienced, and whom the men listened to.<br><br>I have seen an officer cry, but never a Senior NCO.   The Battery 2IC was so hated that none of the NCOs (except for the BSM, whom the Battery 2IC had never crossed sword with) would obey his orders - and thus the crying incident.   As you can imagine, he totally lost all our respect since then.<br><br>Any other incidents that inspire respect or disrepect that you have encountered?</div>

Sometimes you need a check to them should they go way too off. For Recruits, I guess seeing the OO is the best option, although I have seen recruits threatening their instructors with this. Not very nice lah.<br><br>I have personally witness a NSF 2LT throwing his rank at an encik because the encik tried to "bully" some other ranks by turning out the guards for more than 10 times within a night. This NSF is usually very quiet and in fact shows respect to most enciks and never throw his rank around. That was the only time I saw him throw rank.</div>

Very difficult trying to rationalise with them. So I guess sometimes really no choice lah. This is also like a last resort.<br><br>Sometimes when you ask a laojiao to do something politely, he refused and try to siam his way. Especially when you are new to the unit. But when you try to tell him it's "instructions" or "orders", he accused you of "throwing rank".<br><br>Really LL lor.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"></div>
