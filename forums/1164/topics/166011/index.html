            <div class='col-md body'>We all have a part to play in the Total Defence of Singapore. After September 11 we are face with a clear and present danger of terrorism. I am wondering if forumers in militarynuts have notice any problems with our current security arrangement or have any suggestions to make for improvement. Please contribute your ideas.

            <div class='col-md body'>That is a valid worry. The question is do we screen foreign workers for any links to terrorists before we bring them to Singapore? Because i understand that sometimes when these workers are brought here to work such as construction workers as stated in their work permit, they end up working as something else like cleaners in HDB estates or at food centres. This makes tracking them difficult.    <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"></div>
