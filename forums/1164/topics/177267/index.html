A spokesman said no decision had been made about the deployment of British forces to Iraq. However, he added: ''If his squadron does go to Iraq, he will probably go with it.''<br><br>As a troop commander, the prince will have the rank of cornet, in charge of 11 men and four light tanks. He will be given control of his own Scimitar armoured vehicle.<br><br>The tanks are part of reconnaissance formations that serve as the furthest forward -- and most vulnerable -- units in a battle area. Their job is to act as the army's eyes and ears, operating ahead of the troops, and gathering intelligence about the movement of enemy forces.<br><br>Any SAS unit given the job of protecting the prince would have to travel alongside his unit in a separate vehicle.<br><br>SAS troops traditionally act as bodyguards when members of the royal family, the prime minister and other senior ministers visit danger areas such as Iraq, Kosovo or Northern Ireland.<br><br>But military experts say it is unprecedented for the elite regiment to be asked to take part in permanent protection duty involving royals on military operations abroad. They point out that Harry would have plenty of protection around him in his own army unit, and said it would not be the best use of the SAS regiment's valuable skills.<br><br>However, the ministry is aware of the risks Harry would be taking in combat zones.<br><br>''The army wouldn't want to take the blame if the third in line to the British throne got wiped out,'' an official said.<br><br>A spokesman for Clarence House said he could not discuss the protection arrangements.</div>

Because quite a number of the British royal family served on ships during both world wars. Infact King George the V or the VI i'm not sure served on a ship that took part in the battle of Jutland.

He describes being in the fore turret of his ship and providing gunnery instructions and receiving enemy fire as well. I dare say they are hardly shielded from the press of the fight.<br><br>In fact, in my earlier post with the letter from King George V to Prince Albert, I thought it was indicative of the spirit of the Royal Family.<br><br>King William IV also served in the Royal Navy as a Midshipman in the Battle of Cape St Vincent in 1780.

A spokesman said no decision had been made about the deployment of British forces to Iraq. However, he added: ''If his squadron does go to Iraq, he will probably go with it.''<br><br>As a troop commander, the prince will have the rank of cornet, in charge of 11 men and four light tanks. He will be given control of his own Scimitar armoured vehicle.<br><br>The tanks are part of reconnaissance formations that serve as the furthest forward -- and most vulnerable -- units in a battle area. Their job is to act as the army's eyes and ears, operating ahead of the troops, and gathering intelligence about the movement of enemy forces.<br><br>Any SAS unit given the job of protecting the prince would have to travel alongside his unit in a separate vehicle.<br><br>SAS troops traditionally act as bodyguards when members of the royal family, the prime minister and other senior ministers visit danger areas such as Iraq, Kosovo or Northern Ireland.<br><br>But military experts say it is unprecedented for the elite regiment to be asked to take part in permanent protection duty involving royals on military operations abroad. They point out that Harry would have plenty of protection around him in his own army unit, and said it would not be the best use of the SAS regiment's valuable skills.<br><br>However, the ministry is aware of the risks Harry would be taking in combat zones.<br><br>''The army wouldn't want to take the blame if the third in line to the British throne got wiped out,'' an official said.<br><br>A spokesman for Clarence House said he could not discuss the protection arrangements.</div></blockquote>It is not just when he is on "patrol" or operation... how about when he is sleeping in his "bunk" or eating in the officers' mess.. some bodyguard will be handy to keep an eye on him.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>More than ever, killing a British Royal can be a right priority.<br><br>Terrorists always look for targets that give impact, something symbolic.<br><br>Killing the third in line to the throne means they are able to target a public figure higher up in the establishment, not just the usual civilians at buses or underground.<br><br>Note, there were always uproar from the public over the holes in security for the British Royals, especially the Queen, when maniacs can break into her bedroom or reporter posing as a household staff.<br></div>
