              <h2><span class="mw-headline">History</span></h2>
              <p>Rupert Murdoch inherited the <a title="Adelaide" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adelaide">Adelaide</a> <em><a title="The News (Adelaide)" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_News_%28Adelaide%29">News</a></em> in 1952 following the death of his father, <a title="Keith Murdoch" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keith_Murdoch">Sir Keith Murdoch</a>. This paper has been described by Bruce Page<sup id="cite_ref-0" class="reference"><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/News_Limited#cite_note-0"><span>[</span>1<span>]</span></a></sup> as the "foundation stone" of News Ltd (and News Corp).</p>
              <p>Over the next few years, Murdoch gradually established himself as
                                          one of the most dynamic media proprietors in Australia, quickly
                                          expanding his holdings by acquiring a string of daily and suburban
                                          newspapers in most capital cities, including the <a title="Sydney" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sydney">Sydney</a> afternoon paper, <em><a title="The Daily Mirror (Australia)" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Daily_Mirror_%28Australia%29">The Daily Mirror</a></em>, as well as a small Sydney-based recording company, <a class="mw-redirect" title="Festival Records" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Festival_Records">Festival Records</a>. His acquisition of the <em>Mirror</em> proved crucial to his success, allowing him to challenge the dominance of his two main rivals in the Sydney market, the <a title="Fairfax Media" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fairfax_Media">Fairfax Newspapers</a> group, which published the hugely profitable <em><a class="mw-redirect" title="Sydney Morning Herald" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sydney_Morning_Herald">Sydney Morning Herald</a></em>, and the <a title="Publishing and Broadcasting Limited" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Publishing_and_Broadcasting_Limited">Consolidated Press</a> group, owned by <a class="mw-redirect" title="Sir Frank Packer" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sir_Frank_Packer">Sir Frank Packer</a>, which published the city's leading tabloid paper, the <em><a title="The Daily Telegraph (Australia)" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Daily_Telegraph_%28Australia%29">Daily Telegraph</a></em>.</p>
              <p>In 1964, News Limited made its next important advance when it established <em><a title="The Australian" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Australian">The Australian</a></em>, Australia's first national daily newspaper, based first in <a title="Canberra" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canberra">Canberra</a> and later in <a title="Sydney" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sydney">Sydney</a>. <em>The Australian</em>, a <a title="Broadsheet" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Broadsheet">broadsheet</a>, gave News Ltd. a new respectability as a "quality" newspaper publisher,<em> <strong>and also greater political influence since The Australian has always had an elite readership, if not always a large circulation.</strong></em></p>
              <p>In 1972, News Ltd. acquired the Sydney-based <em><a title="The Daily Telegraph (Australia)" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Daily_Telegraph_%28Australia%29">Daily Telegraph</a></em> from <a title="Frank Packer" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frank_Packer">Sir Frank Packer</a>, making Murdoch one of the "big three" newspaper proprietors in Australia, along with <a title="Fairfax Media" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fairfax_Media">Fairfax Media</a> in Sydney and his father's old <a title="The Herald and Weekly Times Ltd" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Herald_and_Weekly_Times_Ltd">Herald and Weekly Times Ltd</a> in Melbourne. In the <span style="color: #000000;"><em><strong><a title="Australian federal election, 1972" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_federal_election,_1972">1972 elections</a>, Murdoch swung his newspapers' support behind <a title="Gough Whitlam" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gough_Whitlam">Gough Whitlam</a> and the <a title="Left-wing politics" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Left-wing_politics">leftist</a> <a title="Australian Labor Party" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Labor_Party">Australian Labor Party</a>, but by 1975 he had turned against Labor, and since then has almost always supported the rightist <a title="Liberal Party of Australia" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liberal_Party_of_Australia">Liberal Party</a></strong>.</em></span></p>
              <p>Over the next ten years, as his press empire grew, Murdoch
                                          established a hugely lucrative financial base, and these profits were
                                          routinely used to subsidise further acquisitions. In his early years of
                                          newspaper ownership Murdoch was an aggressive, micromanaging
                                          entrepreneur. His standard tactic was to buy loss-making Australian
                                          newspapers and turn them around by introducing radical management and
                                          editorial changes and fighting no-holds-barred circulation wars with
                                          his competitors. By the 1970s, this power base was so strong that
                                          Murdoch was able to acquire leading newspapers and magazines in both
                                          London and New York, as well as many other media holdings.</p>

              <h3><span class="mw-headline">Influence in Australia</span></h3>
              <p>Murdoch's desire for dominant cross-media ownership manifested early—in 1961 he bought an ailing Australian record label, <a title="Festival Records (Australia)" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Festival_Records_%28Australia%29">Festival Records</a>, and within a few years it had become the leading local recording company. He also bought a television station in <a class="mw-redirect" title="Wollongong" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wollongong">Wollongong</a>, <a title="New South Wales" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_South_Wales">New South Wales</a>,
                                          hoping to use it to break into the Sydney television market, but found
                                          himself frustrated by Australia's cross-media ownership laws, which
                                          prevented him from owning both a major newspaper and television station
                                          in the same city. Since then he has consistently lobbied, both
                                          personally and through his papers, to have these laws changed in his
                                          favour. This occurred in 2006 when the Liberal-National Coalition
                                          Government, having gained control of both houses of the Australian
                                          Parliament, introduced reforms to cross-media ownership and foreign
                                          media ownership laws. The laws came into effect in early 2007.</p>

              <p class="intro"><strong>IF
              there were a moment when the fragile relationship between Joel
              Fitzgibbon and the defence establishment finally snapped, it might have
              been the surprise attack the minister launched on his own flock in
              Brisbane last October.</strong></p>
              <p>On that day Fitzgibbon
              did what previous defence ministers have rarely done: he gave his own
              defence force a blunt public spray about its big-picture priorities and
              its lack of preparedness for battle. Fitzgibbon was angry about not
              having the option of deploying the army's Black Hawk helicopters into
              Afghanistan. The minister had been taking political heat over an
              inadequate number of NATO medical evacuation choppers available for
              Australian troops at their base in Tarin Kowt, in Oruzgan province.</p>
              <p>"If we do see a strategic and tactical justification for sending
              Black Hawks to Afghanistan tomorrow, we would be unable to do so as
              they lack the electronic warfare self-protection they require,"
              Fitzgibbon lamented. "We spend a lot of time thinking and talking about
              important capability as we look far out into the future, but we seem to
              spend much less time talking about the capability we need to do the
              things we do right now and on a regular basis."</p>
              <p>The minister's comments broke the rules of keeping such criticism
              in-house. Defence likes to see its ministers keep a stiff upper lip in
              public, confining any criticism to private meetings. Fitzgibbon put his
              department offside on that day, but he also made a telling point. Few
              Australians are fully aware that tens of billions of dollars' worth of
              front-line weaponry from the navy, air force and army cannot be sent to
              war today unless it is a low-level, low-risk operation.</p>
              <p>As the Government puts the finishing touches to the new defence
              white paper, it is gearing up for a public relations blitz about the
              futuristic, sleek and powerful Australian Defence Force of tomorrow.</p>
              <p>What the Defence Department won't tell you is that, as things stand,
              most of Australia's warplanes and ships cannot be sent to any conflict
              involving an opponent with a half-decent air defence system and modern
              anti-ship missiles.</p>
              <p>Across the entire ADF, an alarming amount of expensive military
              equipment is not in a suitable upgraded condition to be sent to war.
              This is the legacy of project mismanagement and a Defence Department
              mindset that focuses more heavily on the defence force of tomorrow than
              on the force of today.</p>
              <p>"It really is amazing how little (equipment) can be actually
              deployed overseas when we have a defence budget of more than
              $22billion," says Andrew Davies, an analyst withthe country's premier
              independent military think tank, the Australian Strategic Policy
              Institute.</p>
              <p>Former senior defence official Allan Behm agrees: "I think the
              public would be absolutely astonished and gobsmacked to think we spend
              so much on defence every year and yet we can't send much (of) it into
              harm's way because it won't work or will not survive in acontest."</p>
              <p>As the Government considers its military options for an increased
              role in Afghanistan, the frustration of the Rudd Government at the
              depleted state of the ADF is growing.</p>
              <p>An investigation by The Australian reveals just how ill-prepared the
              ADF is for an immediate crisis. It finds much of the defence force's
              most powerful weaponry is awaiting future upgrades or promised
              replacements and is useful only for training purposes or deployment on
              operations where there is little or no risk of high-level conflict.</p>
              <p>This problem needs to be seen in context. No defence force keeps its
              entire inventory on war footing; such a practice would be prohibitively
              expensive and pointless when no enemy is apparent.</p>
              <p>All Western defence forces, including the ADF, are in a constant
              state of transition with armoury being upgraded and replaced as it
              becomes obsolete. But this long-term upgrading process must be balanced
              against existing requirements and future short-term contingencies.
              Experts say this balance has been lost.</p>
              <p>"The problem with readiness planning has arisen because of
              peacekeeping and other short-notice commitments (that) have seen us
              having to deploy assets quickly and put them in harm's way," says
              Daniel Cotterill, a defence analyst with Hill and Knowlton and until
              recently Fitzgibbon's chief of staff.</p>
              <p>"There is a bias within defence towards investing in the future
              force rather than giving government the fully functioning options they
              really need today." For example, if Australia were asked to provide
              warplanes for an immediate operation against a country with a
              functioning air defence system, it could not do so.</p>
              <p>The F-111 strike bomber, which will be retired next year, can't be
              deployed to a hot war zone because it has insufficient electronic
              warfare self-protection and is too easily detected by enemy radar. "The
              F-111 has the radar cross-section of a house and (it) would have great
              survivability issues in a modern threat environment," Cotterill says.
              "I don't think the Government would deploy one of those to a hot
              fighting war."</p>
              <p>That conclusion has precedents. In the 1990s the F-111s were not
              able to deploy to Operation Desert Fox (against Iraq) because they
              lacked the required radar warning systems. Similarly, most of the air
              force's 71 F/A-18 Hornets can't be deployed against modern air defence
              systems because they have not yet been upgraded with a mature
              electronic warfare capability.</p>
              <p>Defence says only 16 F/A-18s have received electronic warfare
              upgrades and even these have been given only an "interim electronic
              warfare capability", raising doubts about theirdeployability.</p>
              <p>"Most ADF aircraft could not operate in an environment where there
              was a radar-based air defence because of electronic warfare
              self-protection issues," ASPI's Davies says.</p>
              <p>The navy also would be largely impotent if it were asked to sail to
              a high-operations war today. "The surface combatant fleet comprises two
              classes of frigates and is ill-equipped for high-level operations,"
              says Davies. "A plan to upgrade the Anzac class frigates into a capable
              air defence platform was abandoned, although an air-surface missile
              defence upgrade will provide a self-defence capability."</p>
              <p>Says Cotterill: "The Anzacs stem from a time when there was zero
              real growth in the defence budget and they were fitted 'for but not
              with' a lot of systems and so they can't be sent to hot zones by
              themselves."</p>
              <p>Those Anzac class ships that have deployed to the low-threat
              environment of the Persian Gulf in recent years have enjoyed the
              protection of US air defence systems. Meanwhile, the navy still has
              none of its four guided-missile frigates available for active service
              because they have not been cleared for operations after a bungled
              upgrade was delayed for five years, blowing the total cost out to $1.5
              billion. Even if both classes of ship could be deployed, they would be
              an easy target for enemy submarines because the navy's anti-submarine
              warfare capabilities are negligible.</p>
              <p>"Our ability to actively search for submarines is very limited to
              short-range technologies and we have little or no ability to
              successfully fire a weapon at a modern submarine," Davies says.</p>
              <p>This is not a new development. In the late '90s a suspected foreign
              submarine was detected off East Timor during the ADF's deployment
              there, causing concern in Canberra because of the known deficiencies in
              the navy's anti-submarine warfare capabilities.</p>
              <p>The navy's helicopter capability is also in disarray, especially
              following the cancellation last year of the troubled Seasprite project.</p>
              <p>"The current fleet of helicopters suitable for embarked operations
              is limited in numbers, availability and capability," says Davies, who
              has written recent capability assessments on all three services. "With
              the cancellation of the Seasprites and the limited war-fighting
              capability of the Sea Kings, the only helicopter suitable for embarked
              war-like operations at the moment is the Seahawk."</p>
              <p>But he says these do not have an anti-surface warfare capability.
              "In other words, they have no ability to fire a missile at any surface
              target whether it is a warship or not."</p>
              <p>The navy's submarine fleet is also poorly equipped for immediate and
              sustained operations, given that half of its six-boat fleet is in dry
              dock for maintenance. In any case, a critical shortage of qualified
              submariners means there are only enough crews to staff three boats at
              any one time.</p>
              <p>If one of those submarines were to be damaged in action, the crew
              would almost certainly die because the navy's only Australian-based
              submarine rescue vehicle, the Remora, is non-operational.</p>
              <p>The army is the best placed of the services to send troops to a hot
              war zone at relatively short notice, but in surprisingly small numbers
              and only with air protection from allies such as the US. "We can't
              really send the army to any place where they have to provide their own
              protection from hostile air attack," Davies says.</p>
              <p>An army insider says that despite having 27,000 members, 15,000 of
              which are in the combat force, the army would struggle to deploy more
              than 1000 extra troops overseas on a sustained basis on top of its
              deployments in Afghanistan, the Middle East, East Timor and Solomon
              Islands.</p>
              <p>"Despite official denials, the army remains stretched," one insider
              says. Another defence insider says there are other problems with army
              deployment capabilities.</p>
              <p>"The army also has a shortage of blue force tracking transponders,
              which allow friendly forces to know where our troops are and help avoid
              friendly-fire incidents. This would limit the number of elements we
              could deploy into a coalition environment."</p>
              <p>In the field, Australian troops cannot be supported by the army's
              Black Hawks because they do not have infrared shields over their
              exhausts, making them vulnerable to shoulder-launched missiles. The
              entire fleet of 33 choppers - a core part of the army's capability -
              cannot be safely deployed to Afghanistan, much less to a more intense
              war.</p>
              <p>This means Australian troops deployed in Oruzgan province are still
              relying on NATO helicopters rather than their own Black Hawks to
              evacuate wounded soldiers.</p>
              <p>The army's ability to provide armoured personnel carriers for its
              troops in a war zone also has been undermined because of doubts about
              the deployability of one of its three types of armoured vehicles: the
              M113 armoured personnel carrier.</p>
              <p>Defence has spent almost $500 million refurbishing the more than 400
              of the Vietnam War-era M113s, only to find that they may be vulnerable
              to roadside bombs, rockets and mines used by insurgents in Iraq and
              Afghanistan.</p>
              <p>"While the upgraded vehicles will protect occupants against small
              arms, anti-personnel mines, light anti-armour weapons, and shrapnel,
              the vehicle will remain vulnerable to 12.5mm or larger projectiles,
              medium to heavy anti-armour weapons, large improvised explosive devices
              and anti-armour mines," Davies says.</p>
              <p>For more than 25 years, successive Australian governments have
              talked up futuristic visions of a more powerful, capable and modern
              defence force.</p>
              <p>The same promise will be made by the Rudd Government in its
              forthcoming white paper. But the Government needs to focus more clearly
              on the reality of today, rather than the elusive armada of tomorrow.</p>

              <p class="intro"><strong>BILLIONS
              of dollars of fighter jets, warships and military equipment cannot be
              used in their current state because they would be too vulnerable to
              enemy fire.</strong></p>
              <p>A critical lack of upgraded
              weaponry has left the Australian Defence Force unable to deploy most of
              its frontline fighters or warships at short notice against any enemy
              with modern air defence systems or anti-ship missiles.</p>
              <p>An investigation by The Australian reveals much of the ADF's most
              powerful weaponry is awaiting upgrades or promised replacements and is
              useful only for training purposes or deployment on operations where
              there is little or no risk of high-level conflict.</p>
              <p>As such, the ADF, which receives $22 billion in taxpayer funds each
              year, cannot conduct any high-level operations without substantial
              support from coalition forces such as the US.</p>
              <p>Former Defence official Allan Behm said: "I think the public would
              be absolutely astonished and gobsmacked to think we spend so much on
              defence every year and yet we can't send much of it into harm's way
              because it won't work or it will not survive in a contest."</p>
              <p>Defence experts say none of the RAAF's soon-to-be-retired F-111
              strike bombers nor the majority of the 71 F/A-18 Hornet fighters can be
              used against modern air defences because they lack sufficient
              electronic protection.</p>
              <p>Similarly, they say the navy's eight Anzac frigates cannot be sent
              into a hotly contested war zone because of a lack of defensive
              weaponry, while the four other frigates, the FFGs, are still
              unavailable after a bungled and delayed $1.5 billion upgrade.</p>
              <p>Experts say the problem reflects a litany of delayed equipment
              upgrades as well as a Defence Department mindset that focuses more
              heavily on future purchases than on current operations. They say the
              proper balance between current and future defence needs has been lost.</p>
              <p>Daniel Cotterill, former chief of staff for Defence Minister Joel
              Fitzgibbon, told The Australian: "There is a bias within Defence
              towards investing in the future force rather than giving government the
              fully functioning options they really need today."</p>
              <p>The Government is in the final stages of preparing a Defence white
              paper that will outline a multi-billion-dollar shopping list of new
              planes, ships and hi-tech weaponry. But the ADF is in a parlous state
              of readiness for serious conflict.</p>
              <p>A deficiency in anti-submarine warfare capabilities means the navy
              would be unlikely to risk sending surface ships into zones where enemy
              subs were present.</p>
              <p>Andrew Davies, an analyst with the Australian Strategic Policy
              Institute, said: "Our ability to actively search for submarines is very
              limited to short-range technologies and we have little or no ability to
              successfully fire a weapon at a modern submarine."</p>
              <p>Only half of the six-boat Collins-Class submarine fleet is available
              and a shortage of crew would make it impossible to sustain operations
              for long.</p>
              <p>The army cannot deploy any of its 33 Blackhawk helicopters into
              warzones, including Afghanistan, because they remain vulnerable to
              shoulder-launched missiles.</p>
              <p>It is also considered unlikely to deploy its M113 armoured personnel
              carriers because, despite receiving a $500 million upgrade, the M113s
              are considered vulnerable to large improvised explosive devices, such
              as those used by the Taliban in Afghanistan.</p>
              <p>Experts say the Government needs to pressure the ADF to make its
              existing equipment more operationally effective rather than wait for
              future replacements.''</p>

              <p>BIAS means that a source's objective or intent in presenting information that may be skewed. granted that human beings being human beings, there is no such thing as a 100% objective article. but those articles aforementioned have possess a inherent political agenda. this agenda has shaped the way that the content is presented and argued, therefore rendering the content compromised.</p>
              <p>without first acknowledging and nullifying those political agenda, <strong>the content is of no consequence.</strong></p>
              <p>its like saying, u ask a biased source or person with known stance on something, to comment on an issue. would you ask a neo-nazi to comment on jews in europe ? would you ask pauline hanson to give a fair objective view on asian immigration ? would you ask greenpeace to talk about nuclear energy ?</p>
              <p>these groups have something called vested interests. political agendas are such vested interests. the vested interests manifest in the things they talk, do or have plans about (policy)</p>
              <p>hence, the presence of these vested interests make these groups BIASED or unobjective.</p>
              <p>the content is useless. there is no need for further discussion. case closed.</p>
              <p>its like you go to a toyota salesman asking him for advice or review about a Ford car. you are just being plain stupid or idiotic to do that, knowing that the information that is provided is compromised and probably not honest.</p>
              <p>you can carry on doing so, but its going to reflect badly on what you say, because it demonstrates you dont have a mind of your own. you dont think about what you post, simply copy and paste.</p>
              <p>and you are doing that lionnoisy, you are not being honest. by presenting a "biased" or a source not even making an attempt at journalistic balance (both sides of the issue which IS the standard practice for good journalistic reporting), you are presenting biased information, with the intent to mislead, obfusticate and facilitate the spread of mistruths.</p>
              <p>you distort facts and actual issues without knowing what is manipulating you.</p>
              <p>therefore, by associating yourself with these content, you are (technically) lying. the content is immaterial to the purpose. these articles were written with the purpose in mind (to discredit kevin rudd) and not actually deal with the content at hand. (do they propose solutions or identify measures taken by ADF or present information about how the programs are currently managed ?)</p>
              <p>its clear that both articles are not about the content at all, the purpose is aimed at politics. not military procurement. its the suspect purpose that renders the articles invalid and flawed.</p>
              <p>to base your argument on flawed information and lies, is to skew perspectives and change facts into mistruths and false allegations. <span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>you are biased</strong></span>.</p>
              <p>to take what you just raised seriously, we should consider the things said by Nazi germany about the jews as scientific facts and truths. same method of applcation being used here by you and your argument.</p>

              (technically) lying. the content is immaterial to the purpose.
              these articles were written with the purpose in mind (to discredit
              kevin rudd) and not actually deal with the content at hand. (do
              they propose solutions or identify measures taken by ADF or present
              information about how the programs are currently managed ?)</p>
              <p>its clear that both articles are not about the content at all,
              the purpose is aimed at politics. not military procurement. its the
              suspect purpose that renders the articles invalid and flawed.</p>
              <p>to base your argument on flawed information and lies, is to skew
              perspectives and change facts into mistruths and false allegations.
              <span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>you are
              biased</strong></span>.</p>
              <p>to take what you just raised seriously, we should consider the
              things said by Nazi germany about the jews as scientific facts and
              truths. same method of applcation being used here by you and your
              argument.</p>

              <p>i didnt say it is not true or incomplete. i say its biased. thats why its a useless piece of junk information. dosent inform you. tells you what other people want you to think. and you are too dumb to realize the implications of that.</p>

              <p>lionnoisy said...which of the info in these 2 articles are not true or incomplete?<br><br>both of them mate... but this bit was the funny one....of course the M113s is ""vulnerable to 12.5mm or larger projectiles, medium to heavy anti-armour weapons, large improvised explosive devices and anti-armour mines"" its a light armoured the same as all the other light armoured vehicles, although the model we are getting is the up-armoured M113AS4<br><br>our fa-18 bugs were deployed to iraq on bombing missions and have the latest electronic updates, the same as the usn  <br><br>not that this will mean anything to you, you will simply repost the same rubbish next month, the same as you posted this crap last month</p>
