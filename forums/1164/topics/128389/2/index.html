No, you don't have to know what job I do and how much I make. I am a Chinese Singaporean, making use of this forum to voice some of my views, thats all you need to know. If my view differs from yours then you need to accept that not all singaporean think the way you do.<br><br>Did I mention Malaysia is our enemy??? In NS, my enemy is my enemy, my instructor didn't say it was Malaysia or anybody, but somehow the scenario always say that enemy coming from the north, well, Japan also attacked singapore from the north so the british guns pointing to the south ended up only use for tourists 50 years later. If China were to attack us in the future, they are likely to come from the north too.<br><br>How do you conclude that I am an extremist?? interesting.....</div>

Swiss history saw many wars with French and Austrian, and later it stood firmly neutral even under the threat of the Germans in both WW. The loyalties of the Swiss German and Swiss French were important to Switzerland but the trust of the other races in the same country was even more crucial in maintaining the country as a whole. There took hundreds of years, many wars and a persistant vision of staying neutral, to achieve what they are today.<br><br>Singapore is only a 40 years old. Singaporean may have different skin colours, and different, or very different religion, but that is not be the most difficult problem. Question is, Do we have a common vision?? or the same definition of "national interest"?<br><br>We side with the Americans in its conquest of Iraq but are we sure our fellow muslim singaporean or even non muslims agree with what the americans are doing?<br><br>Some singaporeans are calling China a threat, but many singaporeans have to go to China in order to find jobs, and more chinese are settling in singapore as singaporean! How do they feel?<br><br>If china and america clash over taiwan, do we stand with the americans, because we firmly believe in what the american stands for, or because we view china a threat to our "national interest", or we side with the one who give us greater economic benefits?<br><br>We talk about greater social integration among the races, but some local singaporeans are openly expressing discomfort mixing with the new immigrants from India and china! Is that conducive in shaping a singaporean singaporean?<br><br>Our education system was designed to help all students learn at least two languages for greater social integration among different races, but many singaporean are migrating because they believe that english alone is good enough, and their children should not be penalized due to poor "other language". Are we all accepting that we should have chinese speaking malays, and indians speaking chinese...just like the Swiss French speaking German and the Swiss German speaking French, or all should speak english and english is enough?<br><br>We have a long way to go....and of course it is natural that we disagree, but there must be something we share in common, lets find out what this is. Singapore should not be just a place to do business, and our common interest should be more than just wanting to survive.....</div>
