            <div class='col-md body'>dumbdumb! Mosquitoes do swarm around.<br><br>Personally, i feel the worst place is lim chu kang. During my alternate week of outfields at tekong, i only need to use mopiko to ease the itch. Not allowed to use mosquito coils. But after all those section training at tekong, my training proceeds to places like mandai, marsiling and most frequently, lim chu kang!!! It's where commando mosquitoes and sandfly thrives. For commando mosquitoes, use SAF insect repellent. Their favourite spots of contact, back of shoulders, deltoids, back and area below your hips. For sandflies, DO NOT use camou scarf, as it's more likely to trap the pissed off sandfly in the net. I experienced it. There's one insect repellent selling at pharmacies that repels gnats, that's the one.<br><br>Teach you a way of getting rid of mosquitoes that can last for some time. Take a piece of flanelette, smear thinly with SAF insect repellent(do not make it wet), light it up and blow off the flame to let it burn like a mosquito coil. If you are using tissue paper, you will have to roll it into a coil. Oh, there's a thing call the sandfly net. Check it out at beach rd.</div>

That also includes (per person) three rolls of toilet paper (for 4 mths; an average of 2-3 pieces a day...lol  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"> ), 1 can of kiwi polish, flannelette (sp?), 3 pkts gas tube cleaner, 3 pkt of foot/body powder, and as mentioned, the repellent.<br><br>I actually prefer the SAF repellent, which was a good thing, since I get all the repellent from everyone in my team....can afford to buah gao gao... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"> The worst place to get bitten? on your backside, and mosquitos that like to explore inside your ears (hence that buzzing sound). The worst thing for us is that we have to remain damn tactical most of the time....so no coils allowed.<br><br>I usually do this: squirt about 1/4-1/2 tube of SAF repellent on your scarf, and then rub all around. You can use it to cover your face when sleeping. As for the ears, just lightly apply repellent...too much and you will feel like someone squeezed a tube of Vaseline into your ears... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"> I think the SAF repellent was good only on your No. 4. so long as you avoid the plastic buttons and clean ur hands of it afterwards (or at least dun touch anything plastic or with paint on it...a difficult proposition at times). ...its also good for leeches..squirt a bit on a leech and see what happens... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"></div>
