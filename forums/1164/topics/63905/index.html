            <div class='col-md body'>why not?<br><br>well he's the S3.. so training under him...<br><br>i'm a medic.. so stationed at the medical centre in tengah air base..<br><br>whenever there's PT or anything like that, we have to be there... and we have to actually go there ourselves!! no vehicle or anything, we have to take bus to LCK camp 2!!<br><br>so, he wants the Best Unit thing.. decided that his own training program was inadequate.. and starts to make the PTI bring the men out on impromptu 5k runs, mock-IPPTs and (get this!) SOC!! being an ADA unit, without an SOC course didn't stop him... he made us run to 2Guards down the road to run the course...<br><br>so, us medics have the training schedule and go whenever there's anything that requires us to be there..<br><br>(oh, have to say the PTI was very angry whenever he has to do impromptu training sessions as he has to look after the needs of another unit)<br><br>one of his impromptu ones, again, unknown to us medics, was called again.. again, the PTI protested in vain... so it went on.. one of the guys got hurt and everything went to heck.. no medic, no safety vehicle, nothing...<br><br>PTI said it was impromptu, with 10 minutes' notice and that medical coverage was not his problems... so the S3 tried to pin it on me.. the IC of the medics that month...<br><br>i was summoned to his office.. and he threatened me with a lot of things.. charge and all that... i stood my ground, pulled out a training schedule signed by HIM for that month.. incensed, he told me i was being put on a charge and he went to get the CO...<br><br>so in front of the CO and the S1, he said i was not at the location when i was supposed to be... so he wanted to put me on a charge of "dereliction of duty" or something like that.. i said "with due respect, sir.. the PT session was not in the training program, you did not send a vehicle to get any medics, you did not try to contact the medics, even the PTI kept protesting these impromptu PT sessions, and now someone is hurt, you want to charge me? on what charge, sir?"<br><br>at that time, the S1 and CO could be seen trying to stifle their laughter.. and i was told to go outside...<br><br>later the S3 was seen with a sullen face... and i was told to stay in the camp from then on.. my stay-out status was "revoked" even though the stay-out thing was because they didn't have space for a bunk for us medics... he made one specifically for me..<br><br>then all the medics did not have to but i had to do the SOC and PT and whatever with the rest of the men...<br><br>that, is what happened..<br><br>stupid: his own fault and he tries to make it someone else fault<br><br>incompetence: a simple vehicle to get a medic would have solved everything<br><br>BS: "i'll put you on a charge and you're going to DB!"<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by fugue:</div><div class="quote_body">Sounds interesting!!
