            <div class='col-md body'>Hi,<br><br>Let us discuss a hypothetical scenario... the Iraqi stituation got worst and there is a full scale conflict with Iran invading Iraq etc....and Singapore is forced to commit sizable "Combat" forces into that country....<br><br>Which "units" do you think Singapore will send?<br><br>Will we send an Armd Bde with SM1/BX/BX2? and then match them with the Apaches based in the US probably shipped to Iraq by the US's C5s?<br><br>Or will we send pure "leg" infantry like the SIBs or the 7 SIB with Super Pumas and Chinooks?<br><br>For the air element, probably te 145 SQN with ground attack capability will be sent.<br><br>What do you guys think?<br><br>Oh yeah, I think our SM1s are going to be death traps in an open terrain environment.<br><br></div>

The very maximum of support given by Singapore to US in Iraq should be around that of our East Timor peace keeping mission. Signals/Comms and air-lift support are also possible but not major ground commitments.<br><br>Our armoured vehicles, i think have been tested in desert terrain before(courtesy of Country X) but the vast majority of our troops are not well trained in a desert environment. Unless of course you include the Ex Wallaby and the recent training exercises in Indian desert by Armour. The deserts in these two countries are different from the one in Iraq which will present a different set of technical difficulties.<br><br>Our Leo2A4 MBTs are not ready yet so cannot be considered as a potential candidate to be sent there. Without MBTs, the fighting with the insurgents using IEDs will be extremely dangerous, if not suicidal.<br><br>Direct engaging the insurgents will allow them to have a chance to pool their forces against us for political effect. This is because Singapore have so far never suffer from any terrorist attacks since the days of Confrontation with Indonesia. Singapore have so far been an oasis of peace and stability in a sea of chaos and violence. And any Singaporean war casualty will break this image of invulnerability and strike fear among the others.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>If we are to engage in combat, it would be much more wiser to embed our special forces into their Joint Special Operations Command and operate on a basis of deniability.<br><br>Regular combat, no way. There's no way the government will risk the political fallout, and the reputation of Singapore is at stake, given that we've always been known to the world as a state that encourages negotiation and business over conflict and war.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Iran and Iraq fought each other for 8 years from 1980 to 1988, bu lang cap, why should anybody want to commit any forces to fight for them now?<br><br>The  world just fought againt Iraq for Kuwait, and now we stand along side Iraq against Iran, 10 years later we stand alongside Iran against their enemy.... very confusing isn't it? We act only with unanimous UN resolution, and we commit forces only as part of the UN forces. Besides, we don't commit in all UN peace keeping missions, why should we commit any forces even if there is a war between Iraq and Iran? War between any two nations is not a reason to us to commit forces. Who else can force us??<br><br>How about this scenario, Jan 15, 2007, North Korea declares war on the South, UN passed urgent resolution to assist and defend South Korea at all costs. For political reasons, Russia and China joined in the condemnation and promise materials support but stop short of sending troops, and for nationalistic reason, Japanese forces are not allowed on the Korean pennisular. The UN is calling for nations to commit troops, if South Korea falls, anything can happen to the rest of Asia, who can we send??</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Troops not desert trained. Fighting in the jungle, desert and urban environment takes a different set of skills. Desert temperatures are highly erratic, day temp. can be damn high only to fall at night. Also, our various toys are largely suited for Jungle Warfare and not Desert Warfare. But possibility of SF teams and medical teams going in is high. If not we will sent the Navy, blockade key ports and sending boarding parties consisting of NDU and SWG to board ships, boats and conduct searches. But then again...has anyone got little intel nuggets of whether our NDU or SWG boys whom have done the port protection or Barsara fired any shots during their boarding or was everyone v.compliant?</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I think the North Korea Scenario is more realistic than the Iraq, Why would Singapore send it's troops to fidht in Iraq where there is no political or material benefit for us? Further more, there is a high possiblity that our men will get killed there. I believe that at most, we'll send our medical teams there or maybe even the Combat Engineers to built some structures.</div>
