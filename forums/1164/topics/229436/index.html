            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote>DEFENCE: $1.5 BILLION DEAL MAKES INDIA TOP BUYER OF ISRAELI ARMS<br><br>New Delhi, 3 Jan. (AKI/Asian Age) - India, with a record 1.5 billion dollars procurement of arms, has helped boost IsraelÂ’s defence industries to record an all-time sales figure of 4.4 billion dollars in 2006. Military ties have flourished under the current Congress Party-led government in India, with India emerging as IsraelÂ’s largest client despite opposition by the Leftist parties which support the ruling coalition government and who have repeatedly urged the Indian prime minister Manmohan Singh to end defence relations with Israel.<br><br>A top Israeli defence official, Maj. Gen. Yossi Ben-Hanan, who is the head of SIBAT, the foreign defence assistance and defence export department at the Israeli defence ministry, has been quoted by the Jerusalem Post as saying that "India was IsraelÂ’s biggest customer, with purchases reaching 1.5 billion dollars." This included what the general described as IsraelÂ’s single largest sale to a foreign country through the Israel Aircraft Industries, the Barak Naval anti-missile defence system, which India has purchased for 450 million dollars. Israel has had no hesitation in identifying Indian support as one of the main reasons for its emergence as one of the top five defence exporters in the world.<br><br>Israel also appears to have equalled Russia as IndiaÂ’s largest military hardware supplier despite entering the market only a few years ago. Russian exports to India every year, according to sources, is also in the range of 1.5 billion dollars, with the defence relationship between the two countries having become strained since IsraelÂ’s entry into the Indian market. Israeli defence exports to India totalled 2.76 billion dollars in the 2002-2005 period, with 2006 registering a record 1.5 billion dollars of sales. According to the US Congressional Research Service, India has beaten China as the leading importer of conventional weapons. In 2005 India spent 5.4 billion dollars on defence equipment, against ChinaÂ’s 2.8 billion dollars.<br><br>New Delhi remains tightlipped about the defence relationship with Israel, which has gone "underground" as experts here put it after the protests by Left parties. This has, however, not stopped New Delhi from inking the deals and sending military delegations, including those headed by the Chief of Air Staff, Air Chief Marshal S.P. Tyagi, and the vice-chief of the Navy, Vice-Admiral Venkat Bharathan, to Israel in the past year.<br><br>Both sides have reaffirmed the strong military ties and agreed to cooperate in research and development projects as well as more defence procurements for advanced radars, long endurance and high-altitude unmanned aerial vehicle and electronic warfare systems. News agencies have reported that missiles and anti-missile defence systems remain the priority area.<br><br>Defence cooperation has been placed on the fast track by both governments, with Israel selling 1 billion dollars worth of defence goods to the US, against the 1.5 billion dollars of equipment shipped to India.<br><br>Maj. Gen. Ben-Hanan said he was not particularly concerned about the US entry into the Indian market, and that Israel would not be in competition as "America sells fighter jets, tanks and helicopters... and we do not compete with them." In fact, he predicted an increase of sales to India as a result. At present US defence exports to India is at a fledgling stage, in the 300 million dollars range. But the potential is being tapped, with the US making no secret of the fact that it expects to accelerate defence exports to India over the next couple of years.<br><br><strong>The Indian government concluded a 220 million dollars deal with Israel early last year for the supply of 50 Herons drones to the Indian Army. These can fly at an altitude of 30,000 feet and are equipped with surveillance technology and an automatic landing and takeoff system. Under another 1.1 billion-dollar deal Israel is mounting three Phalcon airborne radars on a Russian IL-76 platform that is expected to be delivered by the end of 2007. </strong><br><br>Apart from the visits of top military officials to Israel, there have been several other goodwill gestures. Two Indian warships docked in Haifa last year on a goodwill visit that a press release issued at the time said "shows the importance India attaches to growing India-Israeli relations and that continued cooperation and engagement between the two countries is expected to grow."<br><br>The last warshipsÂ’ visit to the port city was in 2004, under the NDA government. India also sent Air Force personnel last year to be trained for the Air Early Warning and Control aircraft (Awacs), of which three are expected to be delivered this year.<br><br>India's external affairs minister Pranab Mukherjee, who was earlier looking after the defence portfolio, was scheduled to visit Israel last year but had to cancel his visit because the dates coincided with a new Israeli offensive in Gaza at the time. The opposition from the Left parties was also a reason, although Indian defence officials admit that there has been no let-up in Indo-Israel military relations because of this and the two governments are in close contact.</blockquote><a href="http://www.adnki.com/index_2Level_English.php?cat=Security&amp;loid=8.0.372911258&amp;par=0" rel="nofollow">http://www.adnki.com/index_2Level_English.php?cat=Security&amp;loid=8.0.372911258&amp;par=0</a><br><br>I think Singapore's spending on Israeli arms have decrease over the years but they are still one of our main suppliers and partners.
