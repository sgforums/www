I have already said, no country does things without due consideration for ITS OWN INTERESTS. America cannot be expected to do any otherwise. Whatever reason we can give, its nowhere near enuff for them to actually fight alongside us. Did you see them fighting for Israel, even though Israel is among their closest allies? We are not even on their 'Ally' list. So I think we Singaporeans should stop flattering ourselves by thinking they will fight for us. All that can reasonably be expected is the continueing of arms supplies and aid. Perhaps they might even throw their weight on the UN to order a ceasefire, but that's about it.<br><br>As for buying US equipment, that's not going to change in the forseeable future. Their eqipment is still the best around. Only thing is they dont release software codes, making any home-made upgrades on the avionics very hard.</div>

Their trade will be disrupted mind you.

I am pro-America too, but dont let it get in the way of logical thinking... If you insist that the US will go to war for Singapore, then let me ask you, did they go to war with the Arab world when Israel was almost annihilated dering the Yom Kippur War? And Israel is a "Major Non-NATO Ally", in US foreign policy parlance. We do not even have <span style="font-style: italic;">that</span>.</div>
