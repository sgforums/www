What I have argued all along is that they will NOT FIGHT FOR US. They will give support diplomatically, and maybe with war supplies, BUT DO NO EXPECT THEM TO BOMB OUR ENEMIES.... jeez, its hard to make you guys understand....</div>

For Korea and Vietnam, it was the ideological battle. That was during the Cold War period, when the threat of Communism was enough for them to draw arms. That's the same reason for their pledge to protect Taiwan, at first. However, now the reason for protecting Taiwan has evolved to that of containing China instead of protecting Democracy. And there's nobody that says America will DEFINITELY come to the aid of Taiwan should cross-strait tensions break out into war.... And Kuwait is about OIL. We do not produce oil, and the oil we have here is not critical to them the way Kuwait's oil is.</div>

If our enemy confines the war to land battles and allow free passages through the malaycca straits, then all the refineries in the middle east can continue to supply refined cargo to japan....supplementing refineries in china, japan, korea, bypassing singapore. Besides there is also supplies coming from the US west coast. Singapore refineries are not supplying the world, so it is not likely that the "world will have very serious oil shortage."<br><br>If our enemy allows the US to continue having access to the facilities in Singapore after the war, or agree to provide alternative facilties such as port klang, protecting the malacca straits as a viable trade route will not be a reason for the US to fight anymore.<br><br>If war in singapore becomes imminent, within a short notice, all foreign funds in singapore can be transferred to other regional financial centers such as hong kong and shanghai. Nobody will fight to protect a financial center.<br><br>US will not commit troops without senate approval and US senate will not send troops in exchange for money. They do not supply mercenaries. For supplies of weapon, they charge very high, learn from Taiwan. We better just pay a few assasins to kill our enemy's leaders than to pay for the US soldiers.<br><br>The only reason for US to fight with us is when we have common enemy; for UN to send troops there must be a UN resolution. See how US tried to get their allies that saddam was their common enemy. There is nothing we can do to tell US we have a common enemy if they do not think so.<br><br>So, we will need friends like the US and the French to supply us war materials, thailand to provide air bases......but it will be singapore and singapore alone who have to decide if we should go to war, when to go, how to go......it is especially true if it is our strategy not to fight battles in our own land, more so we have to be the one making the call, not waiting for our friends to agree....<br>.<br><br>Lets hope our diplomatic efforts are good enough and there will be no war.</div>

I mean, we do provide faciliation offices, maintainence/resupply means, even R&amp;R, for visiting troops, but they're certainly not on the military/economic scale of the British &amp; its Naval Base days at Sembawang (ask your pa or grandpa).<br><br>Much of the ongoing tactfulness is due to historical baggage &amp; geopolitical realities:<br><br>&gt;&gt; Foremost is the survivalist instinct or so-called siege mentality: the initial "poisonous shrimp" analogy (small but indigestable by predators), subsequently displaced by the Total Defence concept (partially hinting at preemptive capacity as effective deterrence).<br><br>&gt;&gt; Background is our constant juggling of the existing multipolar balance of power, both within SE Asia (Malaysia &amp; Indonesia) &amp; also the larger Asia-Pacific area (notably China &amp; Japan). That's why we joined SEATO as part of Malaya, then tried to maximize AMDA's unique arrangements (KL's "non-aligned" stand discouraged British staging posts locally for SEATO purposes) during the Self-Government &amp; then Merger eras.<br><br>&gt;&gt; Attitude is an underlying mistrust of overdependence on other countries, esp. post-'65. Singapore's 1st attempt at joint-military cooperation (to foster bilateral trust with Malaysia) was provided for under the Separation provisions, but it quickly crumbled &amp; hasn't recovered since. The only quasi-military security treaty we have today is the FDPA, initially designed to replace AMDA but, from the local perspective, is realistically "valued" most of all as a neutral platform to build security cooperation/confidence across the Causeway! (Beyond the golf games between senior officers, that is.) There's also an argument to be made that the ANZAC links are also comparatively more "precious" than the US's, since historically they, along with Britain, have deployed individual infantry battalions here until the '70s &amp; '80s (under the FDPA, indirectly to aid our "poisonous shrimp" strategy).<br><br>[I also recall reading somewhere that Singapore has some unease about "too-friendly" US military ties, esp. since they're reluctant to reciprocate by sharing or transferring some of technology &amp; arsenal.]<br><br>In short, we have what Tim Huxley calls a very "opaque" defence strategy: train primarily to deter, except there's no explicit rival enemy (officially anyway); exponentially encourage military cooperation &amp; strategic relationships for shared-partner stability, yet fear being swallowed by bigger entities (even the idea of a ASEAN-level military force); occasionally impatient with the pace of regional joint-service training (with Malaysia particularly perceived as the reluctant partner), while attempting to suppress, or at least downplaying, our "seige mentality". The American presence in this part of the world is of paramount importance to us, but the regional subtext is just too sophisticated for us to ally unreservedly with them, like certain countries do.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Frankly, it's dubious to think that the USA will come to our rescue to protect our financial- or oil-market niches. Just cuz Singapore is run like a Inc., it doesn't mean America is also of the same mind. Imagine the grassroots &amp; media fallout over there if their troops are mobilized just to protect their big businesses (see Iraq).<br><br>Yes, the devastation of Singapore would be a major economic setback for them, but it's not like they can't switch to contingency plans, eg. partner ambitious Thailand in oil refinery or bankroll Hong Kong further as a financial center. Or, for that matter, finance the building of the Kra Canal &amp; bypass the Straits of Malacca altogether.<br><br>If anything, I'll say we (&amp; only we) have consistently attempted to keep the US military actively interested in this region. Malaysia &amp; Indonesia are non-aligned; the latter becoming democractic as well. Thailand is historically neutral. The Phillippines remained corrupted to the core. Indo-China are still recovering from colonialist &amp; war remnants for this generation. America's main interest in the Asia-Pacific is in the north-east, &amp; have accordingly based their troops there (South Korea, Okinawa, Taiwan if need be). Post-Clark Air Base, Singapore have provided them an alternative refueling stop in SE Asia, but it's likely they'll find Australia, their main ally in this part of the world, as an adequate staging area to react to any regional crisis.<br><br>Putting my wargaming cap on: No, we'll ultimately control our own military destiny but, for argument's sake, IMO the countries that will plausibly come to our aid shall be, in this order:<br><br>(a) Malaysia, but only to combine vs. hostile Indonesia,<br><br>(b) ANZAC-Britain, mainly due to Commonweath &amp; historical ties, but also the FPDA agreement which was conceived on the premise that Singapore-Malaysia are indivisable in defence, never mind sovereignty;<br><br>(c) China, assuming they ultimately have superpower designs &amp; wants SE Asian stability most of all, even if it takes a Sino-sphere of influence to replace the disintegrating ASEAN;<br><br>(d) the USA, but unlikely if it's anyone other than the Chinese who was invading, &amp; only then likely to strike the mainland for geopolitical control (instead of liberating us).<br><br>Thailand could slot between (b) &amp; (c), but I dunno if they'll take the initiative if we were warring with a fellow SE Asian country. My speculation is they'll ally more with America economically &amp;, as stated earlier, activate the Kra Canal project. Taiwan could also slot in between (b) &amp; (c), but they lack international legitimacy. India's revived relations with this region is still at the infant stage. Indonesia remains largely an unknown; we'll have to see how the new progressive political system translates into foreign policy.</div>

Singapore's refined products output is high because of its efficiency. Turnaround is faster because the refineries are on islands. Singapore refineries are constantly upgrading to get higher yield per barrel. But, over the years, the oil producing countries built refineries to add values to its crude, e.g. indonesia, UAE, China..... High energy consumption countries such as japan, korea, thailand, taiwan and china built refineries in order not to be too dependent on imports. Countries like korea built refineries to secure supplies of naptha for their ethylene plants. I am only talking about the refineries in Asia, not even those in the middle east or australia, yet. In short, there are many capacities outside of singapore.<br><br>Singapore is the main refining center catering for asia, rottadam for europe and houston for usa. so if singapore capacities were down, it will stretch the supplies world wide but unlikely resulting in a very serious world shortage.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Good call with the last 2 posts.<br><br>I'm inclined to think that Singapore oil-refinery niche may attract more Chinese engagement with this region for the future. Currently we've pretty much cornered that market in this part of the world, &amp; logically a growing China will desire staking a stable foreign partnership in this industry (esp. with experts saying India's gonna our oil exports by next year).

Natural "buffers" Thailand &amp; Malaysia are logical obstacles to a Chinese southern sweep aiming to "aid" us, so I won't put it past the Thais, with their successful neutrality negotiations throughout history, to establish mutual-benefiting ties with China (&amp;/or America) to gain from the new reality.<br><br>Whether we win or lose in a war, our island will be physically devastated to a significant degree.
