            <div class='col-md body'>US says 'NO' to Israeli request to fit their own avionics/weapons to F-35<br><br>The US is refusing to allow Israel to fit its own avionics/weapons to F-35. Israel has integrated Python series AAMs and Popeye ASM to its fleet of F-15s and F-16s. Meanwhile Norway wants to use NSM and IRIS-T on the F-35 as well.<br><br>http://www.israelnationalnews.com/news.php3?id=104160<br><br>Growing Tension Between U.S. and Israel Over F-35 Jet Fighter<br>21:25 May 23, '06 / 25 Iyar 5766<br><br>The U.S. has indicated that it will not allow Israel to install its own advanced equipment on next generation fighter planes, the F-35, limiting IsraelÂ’s technological edge over its enemies.<br><br>The F-35, a next generation jet fighter, costing $276.5 billion in development and purchasing costs, is being built in the United States with input from a number of U.S. allies. Though Israel is playing only a small role thus far in developing the plane, it expects to ultimately purchase the jet for the IDF.<br><br>According to a report in MaÂ’ariv, the U.S. is refusing to allow Israel to develop its own guidance, firing, and missile systems for the new aircraft.<br><br>That policy will come as a heavy blow to Israel Aircraft Industries which has traditionally has put its ultra-advanced high-tech equipment in fighter jets purchased from the United States.<br><br>Many military strategists claim that IsraelÂ’s technological superiority over its enemies is derived mainly from the advantage it attains by grafting its own top secret equipment onto the American planes.<br><br>This is especially true in cases where the U.S. sells some of its most sensitive and sophisticated equipment to erstwhile allies, such as Egypt and Saudi Arabia, which are potential military adversaries of the Jewish State.<br><br>Israeli aeronautic military technology has gained worldwide renown for making U.S. fighter jets much more effective in combat. Souped up Israeli versions of American jets have a clear military advantage over their generic counterparts. U.S. refusal to allow Israel to use its unique technologies on the F-35 may put IsraelÂ’s strategic military advantage at risk.<br><br>An Israeli air force delegation that recently visited the U.S. and toured the Lockheed Martin plant where the plane is being developed failed to convince American officials of the importance of fitting Israeli weapons systems into the F-35.<br><br>As a result, Israel is considering withdrawing from the project altogether. Other countries involved in developing the plane, Britain, Turkey, and Norway, are also reconsidering their involvement due to widespread cost overruns that are running into tens of billions of dollars, and production delays.<br><br>A Lockheed spokesman said the company expects to test a prototype by 2008 and deliver the aircraft by 2011. The Pentagon is planning on manufacturing 2500 jets, primarily for the U.S. and British air force.<br><br>Published: 19:02 May 23, 2006<br>Last Update: 21:25 May 23, 2006<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>USA need its partners to provide money to fund the development of the F-35 and thus the current international cooperation. But they are unwilling to let them have the technology to manufacture certain parts or make modifications to them in order to protect their own defence industries, in short to allow the other participating countries to benefit from their involvement! Further more the program is now way over budget. I guess USA must have thought of these paticipating countries as fools!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"></div>

However I am still unsure whether the Americans will release in for export before 2010, or ever at all.<br><br><a href="http://www.defenseindustrydaily.com/2006/06/israel-plans-to-buy-over-100-f35s/index.php" rel="nofollow">http://www.defenseindustrydaily.com/2006/06/israel-plans-to-buy-over-100-f35s/index.php</a><br><br>But my personal opinion is that it will eventually be available to important and trusted allies like Israel, Japan, South Korea or even Singapore. But if Singapore were to acquire even a reduced cost export version, given the still very high price tag it is unlikely that we will get more than 18 or 20. These will perhaps constitute a squadron mainly for air superiority and will serve alongside the F-35As, F-15SGs and remaining F-16C/Ds in any future force structure.<br></div>

I mean just look at the way they had touted their latest weapons in the past.. from the F-4 to the Pac-3..<br><br>While the F-22 is perhaps the most advance in the world.. to say that it is invisible to radar is crap! It still have an RCS and only at the direct front would the have 0.016m2 profile.. but behold the F-15 pilots needs to look around their canopy to see.. not detect.. them... what a load of of BS.<br><br>Then there is the 10:1 ratio, then the 105:1 ratio engagement.... all propapaganda.. BS..<br><br>OK, so let's say Radar (Only US Radar) cannot detect.. but to engage enemies on BVR it needs to luminate them first.. Detection.. OK so what so great about stealth (Perceived) when the F-22 seems depended on their Radar and missle tech.. more !! The missle isn't new !!

Can u explain why the F-15 should be able to detect an object with the radar cross section the size of a pigeon?</div>

And if they do, they have an advantage because if u are defending,chances are you will have you radar up and searching,but u still will have problems finding the f22,thus they can plot to hit you while u cant plot to hit them.<br>But i think the F22 is over hyped hah.</div>
