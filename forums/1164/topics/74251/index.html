For example how everything is so elitist in Singapore from the school system to determining who can enter a casino.<br>- Lifestyle. You can only stand the rat race for so long.<br>- Politics. To put is simply, its claustrophobic<br>- Cost of Living. This is totally different from standard of living.<br><br>Pull factors overseas<br>- Climate. You can only stand Singapores tropical weather that long<br>- Simpler, cheaper lifestyle. A middle class family needs not scrimp and save to pay off a 30-year home loan for a pigeon hole and a set of wheels<br>- Old age: In addition to what you have, the system looks after its citizens in recognition for their contributions to the country no matter how small.<br><br>These reasons just scratch the surface, and might not apply to everyone. The issues are a lot more complex<br><br><blockquote><strong><br>is the government doin enough to keep singaporeans here?<br></strong></blockquote><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="font-style: italic;"><strong>NO!!</strong></span></span><br><br><blockquote><strong><br>is it the problem of foreign talent?<br></strong></blockquote>Yes. But the issue is mainly to do with the government's definition of "foreign talent". Theres no issue with real "talent" who are brought in to make up for a shortfall in skills and knowledge in the locals. The problem is that the government is bringing in large numbers of foriegners to bring down costs of doing business here (which is high not due to labour but in a large part due to land, utilities and other costs) as they demand less (easy when cost of living in your home country is low and you don't have a 30-year HDB loan to pay off)<br><br>In short, this is an area where the interests of Singapore and the interests of Singaporeans diverge. And instead of finding a middle ground like it should, the government is shafting Singaporeans big time. Small wonder Singaporeans are disenchanted. And because they are unable to make themselves heard, those who can, vote with their feet.<br><br><blockquote><strong><br>is it our younger generation who do not have a sense of belonging to singapore and does not sees NS as a duty to the nation?<br></strong></blockquote>In a way, yes. But NS is small beans compared to other reasons. Anyway, the young who have not served NS have no say in their family's decision to migrate.</div>

As for the more developed countries, theres no comparison. The talk of overpaid Singaporean workers is absolute rubbish. The problem is when you have sky-high cost of living here, coupled with not sky-high wages and thats where the problems begin.<br><br>You're absolutely right about the education and training part.

However, all I can say is to remember that we have a government who, when the choice is between hurting it's own bottomline to help Singaporeans, or to maintain its bottomline and screw Singaporeans over, it will choose the latter option. Almost every time.<br><br>Unless, an election is round the corner and/or it doesn't hurt the bottomline too much</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>what are the factors that is causing singaporeans to emigrate? </strong><br>Other than for a better quality of life, sometimes you just have to uproot and go where the job takes you to or where the jobs are. This is all part of globalisation. Can't afford to sit around and wait<br><br><strong>is the government doin enough to keep singaporeans here? </strong><br>Definitely not. They keep you on a treadmill and tell you that you are never running fast enough. If the economy goes up, it is because they are doing a good job. So big pay packages for the guys at the top. If the economy goes down, because US and Europe are not doing well and Singapore is depedent on external demand. So man in the street takes pay cut. What kind of crap is this?????<br><br><strong>is it the problem of foreign talent? </strong><br>It is always good to have global talent. Ldn, NYC and Tokyo and Shanghai will not be what they are today if they shut out the foreigners. Interaction brings out new ideas. But let us not get carried away and treat them like god-sent. They way Singaporean press has potrayed "foreign talent" is definitely down right ugly.<br><br><strong>is it our younger generation who do not have a sense of belonging to singapore and does not sees NS as a duty to the nation? </strong><br>Not true! The love for a country should not translate into blind faith. Nationalism encourages that each citizen contributes to society and make it a better place. That is why debate on different ideas and policies is important and should be encouraged. NS is of course the duty of every able man to protect his home<br><br><strong>HDB loan write down?</strong><br>Guys I think this will be difficult. Take a look at the 1997/8 IMF report on the Singapore economy. It is obvious that the CPF system is underfunded and whatever GIC or Temasek has in assets need not be easily liquidated to be used for this refund.<br><br>Lower value of housing. That is again a tough call. With so many Singaporeans already having a mortgage, doing so risk putting many households in the category of negative equity which will be bad for the economy.<br><br>In the same vein, it is also true, why the call for pay cuts in Singapore is a bad idea. Yes it saves job in the short term. But until now no one has stepped forward to propose how Singapore should deal with this wage deflation spiral. Lower wages - less consumption, biz goes broke and more pay cuts....lower asset wealth and more cut back in consumption???? Singaporeans will be getting poorer by the day. Look at today's news pte home prices going lower.....<br><br>Other than wages, we can lower the cost of transport, land cost for office and industrial. Not every government agency needs to make a tidy profit so that its Chairman gets a handsome bonus.<br><br>Becareful when the press tells you that Singapore still has the cheapest mass rail system compared to major cities in Asia. Have you wondered abt the freq of the trains.<br><br>SMRT peak 1 train per 5min and off-peak 1 per 8/10min<br>MTR (in HK) peak 1 train per min and off-peak 1 per 3min<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Dear Dkhoo,<br><br>It is essential that the government incurs a budget deficit during a business downcycle so as to take out some of the volatility. Volatitlity causes economic dislocation and unnecessarily increases business cost. Such is economics, I do wonder where you received your training? PAP school of economics? And their deficit is not real deficit as their calculation does not include funds earned from land sales like other countries do. So they have in fact been running a budget surplus during this time.<br><br>If a government keeps running a budget surplus, it is providing a net withdrawal of resources from the economy at each stage of the business cycle. Is that desirable? Only if they are the best investors in town and the dividends reaped are distributed back to the economy. So far there is little to prove either way.</div>

A real pity.</div></blockquote>If HDB writes off part of the housing loan, it need not be inflationary.<br>In fact there is nothing wrong with inflation. The problem is always and only with excessive inflation. An inflation rate of 1-2% is actually good for the economy. It gives corporates pricing power and also benefits net debtors. On the contrary, SIngapore had seen two years of very low or negative inflation. It reflects how weak domestic demand was and if HDB were to allow debt forgiveness, I wonder if it will be negative for us. US fed Chairman has tried very hard not to have to US economy slip into negative inflation for fear of compounding the economic weakness!<br><br>The PPP adjusted per capita GDP although a widely used measure is not a good gauge of quality of life. Are you sure our quality of life is comparable to the West? This is not to belittle what Singapore has achieved. PPP numbers only shows roughly how much money each of us have after adjusting for the cost of living. But it does not account for what we are able to buy with that money and the social freedom one gets to enjoy. For example, if you are into classical music, does your high PPP dollars allow you to watch live performances of the Wierner Philharmoniker every week? No, because they are based in Berlin!!!! Are you able to move Disneyland into Singapore for our children to enjoy? No! you have to pay for an extra return airticket!!!! Using numbers like PPP is how the Singapore government likes to argue its case... but how untrue it is of the realities of life!<br><br>On the last point, government reserves is not equivalent to foreign reserves. Governemnt reserves is fiscal resrves plus foreign reserves. Fiscal reserves is simply the accumulation of all previous budget surpluses. So asking them to dip into the reserves need not mean running down foreign reserves!</div>
