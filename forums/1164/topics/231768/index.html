As soon as they are eligible they must become Australian citizens.<br><br>"Foreign nationals may join the ADF in competition with other suitable applicants irrespective of previous military service. They must meet Australian immigration and permanent residency requirements as well as the normal ADF entry standards," a defence spokeswoman said. "Overseas applications from foreign nationals with extensive military experience will be considered for positions where skill shortages exist in the ADF.

It is a similar story with the RAAF.<br><br>With a nominal permanent strength of 13,000, the air force needs 457 technicians to keep its fleet of jet fighters, transports and helicopters at peak operational readiness.<br><br>The army appears to be faring best of the three services. The 25,000-strong force has 362 vacancies in its technical trades.<br><br>But with the delivery of new Abrams tanks now under way, and armed reconnaissance helicopters rolling off the assembly line in Queensland, senior commanders are becoming increasingly concerned at a growing deficiency in skilled tradespeople.

I think we've got to match that, but it's not all about money."<br><br>While Britain and New Zealand have been the traditional recruiting pool for the ADF because of the similar levels of professional standards and training, the dragnet has been extended to Canada and now the US where ads have been placed in military publications seeking appropriately skilled new recruits for the ADF.<br><br>The Australian Defence Association's Neil James said there was no magic solution to solve the recruitment crisis.<br><br>British submariners had been attracted to the RAN in the past.<br><br><a href="http://www.theaustralian.news.com.au/story/0,20867,21051347-31477,00.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.theaustralian.news.com.au/story/0,20867,21051347-31477,00.html</a></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>THE army faces a growing skills crisis as it battles to staunch a flow of resignations of technicians and tradespeople caused by the insatiable demand of the booming resources sector.<br>Senior commanders say more than 1000 new army recruits are urgently needed, with an increasing emphasis placed on trade apprentices wanting to learn mechanical and electrical engineering - skills vital for the army's increasingly complex equipment inventory.<br><br>The army's recruiting target for technical trades in the 2006-07 financial year has been set at 362 and will almost certainly be increased.<br><br>Army recruiters are struggling to compete against a mining-led resources boom, which is offering young skilled tradespeople starting salaries of up to $150,000 a year.<br><br>Senior commanders fear the problem will reduce the army's self-sufficiency, leading to more work being outsourced to the private sector.<br><br>The problem is being exacerbated by the army's multi-billion-dollar acquisition of high-tech equipment including new tanks, helicopters, unmanned drones and self-propelled artillery.<br><br>While infantry recruit numbers are increasing, the Chief of Army, Lieutenant General Peter Leahy, believes the army will have to change its recruitment methods. "I know Queensland and Western Australia in the mining industry there, it's going gangbusters," Lieutenant General Leahy said.<br><br>"You can't blame young blokes looking at $150,000 from saying, 'I'm into that'. I think we've got to match that, but it's not all about money."<br><br>Lieutenant General Leahy said the army was "about 1000 short" of recruiting targets "but the targets this year are looking promising and I'm pleased".<br><br>"We're actually overachieving by about 200 per cent on our infantry soldiers and I'm thrilled with that. But we're having trouble with our technical trades and that's why we're here. I want to do a whole lot better in that area."<br><br>Three current weapons procurement contracts underscore the army's predicament - the $1.3 billion order for 22 Tiger armed reconnaissance helicopters, $570 million for 59 modernised Abrams main battle tanks and about $600 million for new artillery, including for the first time, 155mm self-propelled guns. The contracts mark a change in the army's configuration from a light infantry force to a more mobile force reliant on high-technology equipment.<br><br>It comprises six battle groups - one armoured and five infantry with provision for two more, one infantry and one armoured. This translates into a 20 per cent rise in numbers over the current total of 40,820 regulars and reserves.<br><br>Lieutenant General Leahy warned that the army was operating in a very competitive environment and required people in 250 different trades.<br><br>"We need to recruit and we need to recruit hard," he said. "I wouldn't suggest its going to be easy to recruit 20 per cent more people over the next 10 years, particularly as the economy is going so well.<br><br>"We can improve our recruiting methods and we can improve our image."<br><br>The Howard Government approved a $1 billion budget to boost recruiting and announced before Christmas a range of financial incentives for servicemen and women, including bonuses to those who want to extend their enlistment.<br><br>Also, people who were convicted of minor drug offences or are overweight can now apply to join the defence force.<br><br>Font size:<a href="http://www.theaustralian.news.com.au/story/0,20867,21030718-31477,00.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.theaustralian.news.com.au/story/0,20867,21030718-31477,00.html</a></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>They might wanna consider combining the New Zealand Defence force and the ADF.  It might improve their manpower issues.  It'll be funny to see ozzies and kiwis serving together in the same military though... they'll probably fight themselves over rugby matches.</div>

Even "best friends" like France and Germany don't do such things. Expect massive public outcry.</div>

Modern world history remembers that the Germans invaded them.... twice!<br><br>Besides, the Germans are more than capable of fighting on their own.  The French are... at best unsteady even with external help.  I doubt the Germans would need them.<br><br>The Kiwis rely on the Aussies for air defense anyways, might as well form a central Ozzie Kiwi- military command to pool their resources together. It might actually benefit both the Kiwis and the Ozzies.</div>
