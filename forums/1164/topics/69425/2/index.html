FOs would give the target grid of the target by reading it off the map. Then the GPOs (Gun positioning officers) would calculate the line and the quadrant that the howitzer should fire on. So when the artllery howitzers fire off their rounds, we give corrections to adjust the round closer to the target and then GPOs would then calculate the new line and quadrant that the howitzers should fire on...<br><br>Basically thats abt it but there is more to the process <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br>cheers...  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"><br><br>anyway just some extra info for you, Artillery unlike small arms hits an area target and not pin point target so there is no need for pin point accuracy... one artillery round (155mm calibre) covers and area of 150m by 150m.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"> </div></blockquote>s|nNeD, you forgot to mention that 155 can also do direct fire role, and that the process of calculation is through the Sharp calculator...Det 3 usually the ranging gun and Det 2 is the illum gun... am I right? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"> I heard that the FH2000 can fire ERFBBB rds, but it cannot sustain that kind of fire for a long period of time...something about burning out the barrel and jolting the gun sight outta alignment, is it true?<br><br>In Thailand, I saw the locals scurrying all over the impact zone looking for scrap metal after every fire mission...dangerous work man....one guy actually picked up a 120mm illum blind the other time and it was in the basket of his Honda Cub....rode alongside us as we were heading back to Sai Yok, shouting "Singapore Good!!

            <div class='col-md body'>So far the discussion was from the perspective of officers in an arty unit, concerned with FOs, GPOs, BROs, ranging and registration.<br><br>From a gun or mortar commander point of view, (from an M71 commander's experience, things might be more automated now) the BRO (recce officer) gives him a position to deploy, the direction (director reading).   The layer sets the reading on the panoramic sight, the gun shifted so that it points to the required direction, then the weapon is emplaced.   Aiming posts and collimator are then used subsequently for laying (aiming for you laymen :-)</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Oops forgot something.   The 155 guns used can be used for direct shooting.   For the M71 (I believe newer guns would use the same principle), a telescopic sight is used for direct shoot.   The sight has lines that is used to aim the gun depending on the distance and speed of the target.<br><br>In my battalion, I think I was the only one who had done direct shoot before.   It was easy because I was shooting at three stationary drums stacked up somewhere in Thailand.   Of course I could see the impact for this case.<br><br>For indirect shoot, I was the only gun commander who had on many occassion seen impacts of 155 rounds in the target area (normally, only the FO and his assistant gets the chance).   I was attached to the FO on one or more occassions (can't remember why).   However, most of the opportunity came when I was involve in a weapon testing program in Thailand.</div>
