All Hogwash" </a><br><br>I highlight, in particular, the following <blockquote>Indian truck drivers who returned after working in Iraq have a poor impression of American soldiers and their valour.<br><br>According to their accounts, whenever armed militants attacked a convoy of trucks ferrying supplies to US troops in Iraq, the escort vehicles carrying American soldiers, instead of protecting the convoy, would be the first to flee leaving the unarmed and hapless truck drivers to fend for themselves.<br></blockquote>You also appear to try and justify the bnehaviour on the basis of an increased chance of survivability. But what about the misssion? Survivablity is important, but so is the mission. If the aim is to protect the convoy, then steps must be taken towards actually protecting. To abandon the mission on the basis of an increased likelihood of survivability is, imo, very unsoldierly behaviour.<br><br>2nd, you say that arming the drivers is out of the question because they are not trained. You also suggest that the driver survived because he was not shooting back. I think you are mistaken on the latter point and misguided on the former.<br><br>Re arming the drivers, it would not take much to train the drivers in basic rifle handling skills. It is not difficult to learn how to fire/mantain a rifle + roe. That could be taught in half a day. In fact, if hard pressed, that could be taught in a matter of hours. Also why should a lack of formal training preclude the carrying of weapons? This is a country where everyman and his goat is armed. To preclude the carrying of weapons on the basis of a lack of formal training is surely folly. At best, this is a safety issue - the coy does not want its drivers to hurt themselves/ hurt others.

In the end, life is about being responsible for your own choices. Did anyone put a gun to their heads n force them to join the army? They're not SAF, they don't have conscription. Abandoning your duty and responsibility after u have CHOOSEN to take them up, can never be justified in anyway.<br><br>And please do not be so condesending. In JC i read up military tactics as a hobby. Don't assume I know nothing about tactics. The fact here, laid plain and bare, is still that a miliatry escort abandoned an unarmed civilian convoy in a combat zone. No matter what doctrines say, I am under the impression that one has to put one's mission 1st. They don't even need to fight to bring the trucks out. All they needed to do was to stall enough to allow the drivers to bail out and escape with them.<br><br>Finally, while u can't order someone to be brave, U'd expect someone who has taken up the responsibility to try their best to be brave. Putting this aside tho, by your own statement, u have admitted that the American soldiers WERE cowardly. And when soldiers are cowardly, no matter how justified it is, they have to face up to the music because when they accepted the responsibility of being a soldier, they knew the risks and they know the consequences of not being brave. And now, they must face the consequences.</div>
