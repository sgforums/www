            <div class='col-md body'>Don't stop...?  but those guys are civilian truck drivers... if ur armed escort drives off immediately when someone starts shooting, then wads the point of having armed escorts in the first bloody place? Scare the kids so they stop throwing rocks?<br><br>Military convoy where every vehicle has armed personnel, yes, don't bloody stop.  But this is not the case.  The civilian truck drivers are unarmed, and taking fire.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Precisely. If you are going to do your normal ambush drills, then you are not doing much escorting and the trucks will be nothing more than bait. IE the inclusion of supply trucks clearly makes the convoy a more attractive target relative to a normal armoured/vehicle/foot patrol. With that in mind, to bugger off at the first sign of trouble is just...not on.<br><br></div>
