The entire site story is linked below.)<br>Like all good nurses everywhere, Van Devanter was expected to comfort her patients, calm their fears, hold their hands, ease their loneliness. That was no more than she expected of herself. When she punched out of Vietnam in June of 1970, at the age of twenty-three she had already seen dozens of grotesque and extravagant varieties of death and mutilation. Even now, after all these years, when she describes her experience, her voice projects the need to speak with both care and efficiency; if she speaks too callously or loudly, the fragile words might themselves tear apart and bleed. "We had a whole squad that was brought in one day. They had been hung up by their ankles. Their genitals had been cut off and stuffed in their mouths. Not a pretty sight. Not the sort of thing a young woman of twenty-one or twenty-two expects to see." <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>Wow, apparently some or all survived their castrations if they were being treated and cared for by the nurses.
