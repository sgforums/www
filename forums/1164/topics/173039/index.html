            <div class='col-md body'>Got this from somewhere<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">A friend of mine was a medic in Vietnam. I asked him what was the most horrific thing he saw. He told of two incidents that still send chills up his spine. One was a GI captured by the VC that was found hanging naked upside down. He was castrated and his co-ck and balls were stuffed in his mouth. The second was another incident where the VC put a burlap bag containing a live rat over a guys head and tied it tight around his neck. The rat ate away most of his face and head before escaping from the bag. Some very hard core stuff. I guess every war had it's horrors, but this was some of the most brutal I have heard of.</span></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>In the book "Marine Sniper" by Charles Henderson, He devotes a whole chapter to the Apache Woman, The real life sadistic female VC. The following is an actual torture/castration she performed on a young captured soldier. The autor added some dialog for interest as if it needed any more. I think any castration is interesting enough. Just imagine being tied up naked and having an attractive Asian woman approach you with a huge knife, knowing she is going to cut your balls and dick off!!!!<br><br>As one of the few U.S. snipers, Carlos faced competition from Viet Cong snipers, who were masters at their art. One of the most feared in his area was a woman, code named "Apache", a fuckin' psycho who, like may female snipers, took special relish in Teaching a Lesson to her foes. Apache enjoyed torturing prisoners within earshot of U.S. bases. -- Across the quarter-mile of rice fields that separated the tree line from the hill, the tormented Marine who had been taken prisoner that afternoon hung naked on a rack made of bamboo. He wore only his boots and the green wool socks that had his name stamped in black ink across the tops. Blood streamed down his cheeks, mixed with tears. The boy, just out of his teens, tried to blink, but the effort only obscured his vision with blood that flooded from where his eyelids had been cut away. He cried and prayed aloud, reacting to the pain each time he strained to blink. The Viet Cong woman had pried off each of his fingernails and was now in the process of bending his fingers backward, snapping them at their middle joints. She had finished with the left and right little fingers and was working her way toward the index fingers, one at a time. Breaking a finger every twenty minutes, she followed a well-planned timetable of torture that covered her prisoner's entire body and would carry the session through the night. At a few minutes before midnight, she had eight fingers to go. The woman and four men from her platoon sat at the Marine's feet, speaking softly in Vietnamese and laughing. The remainder of her platoon lay quietly surrounding her in a maze of sniper hides, ready to ambush anyone who might try to come to rescue the prisoner. The woman chewed betel nut, spitting the juice between her feet as she squatted with her arms resting across the tops of her knees. She looked at the youthful Marine. "You cherry boy? I think maybe no. You get plenty pussy back stateside, yeah. You get Vietnamese pussy too? I think you do. You go China Beach swimming, fuck plenty. "You like get cherry pussy? Plenty American GI like cherry pussy. Rape many young girl-take cherry pussy. True! I know true." She shouted in Vietnamese at the men squatted by her, and they glared at the Marine. The woman walked to where the boy hung limp on the bamboo rack and spit a mouthful of betel nut into his eyes. "You goddamn-fucking GI!" she said... As the fog thickened just before dawn, the Viet Cong woman torturer completed her work on her prisoner. "Goddamn-fucking GI. You no fuck no more," she said, as she approached him with a long, curved knife in her hand. Taking his genitals in her left hand, she jammed the blade's point beneath the base of his penis, grazing his pubic bone. She pulled the knife with a sweeping, circular cut that released both testicles and his penis in one large handful of flesh that gushed with blood. Blood surged from the gaping cavity left between his legs. She knew that this man could not last long, and, quickly cutting away the cords that bound him to the bamboo rack, she said, shaking with laughter, "Run, GI. Maybe you live-you find doctor in time! Run to wire. We watch Marines shoot you fucking ass." The Marine ran, shouting unintelligibly, as blood gushed so rapidly from his body that it left jellylike pools on the compost of decaying leaves that covered the forest floor. And when he emerged from the trees on the far side of a rice field that lay below the observation post where Land and Wilson watched, he began waving his arms, screaming incoherently and sobbing. "The poor bastard's trying to tell us not to shoot," Land said. "Look at him, Gunny. That bitch has emasculated him."</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I think medival torture can be as cruel.<br><br>Dacula the impaler used to hang his captives on stakes going into their anus or vagi*a. As they are bound the stake would slowly inch its way (due to gravity) over many days through the abdominal cavity till it finally pireces the diaphragm and lung and the person dies.<br><br>being <strong>racked</strong> (stretched till all the long bones break) <strong>drawn</strong> ( open up abdominal cavity - minimising blood loss and cutting up intestines and finally removing the heart) and <strong>quartered</strong> (body seperated by horses and distributed in pices to different parts of the country) is also pretty horrible (ala braveheart)<br><br>anyhow, all torture should be banned<br><br>in fact war should be outlawed if possible</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>The story about the VC female sniper sound more like an urban legend than fact.<br><br>It is very rare for snipers to capture and torture enemy soldiers. Whether it is a regular or guerilla army, the sniper's role is to remain concealed in enemy territory, shoot some enemies and then disappear.<br><br>It would be very unlikely for the sniper, usually working alone or in pairs, armed with a semi-automatic long rifle to go and capture enemy soldiers and march them back to base camp.<br><br>It is even more unlikely that a fighter with such valuable skills as a sniper would be wasting time in a POW camp torturing prisoners when she should be out sniping.<br><br>(Unless it is her R&amp;R).<br><br>The VC or NVA have plenty of people capable of sadistic torture, they don't need a prized sniper to do it.<br><br>In Iraq, there is also the urban legend of a super Iraqi sniper named "Juba". Since the US soldiers there never saw him before, how do they know it is the same guy? But that's exactly what snipers do: instil a sense of fear and dread in enemy so much so that they create a myth around them.</div>
