Being from old soldier batch during NS days and then "new Army" during reservist days, I have observed how training/ courses being doled out to soldiers.<br><br>During NSF, 99.99 % unlikely to be able to choose your course, much less yr vocation (it is fated, as some cynical friends said). The only way you can "choose" is like this.... at recruit stage do well in PT, SOC etc, be as cooperative and show leadership signs. You then get picked to OCS or SISPEC. In OCS or SISPEC, do well in say your presentation and orders giving, but keep to being average in PT... high chance you get selected to be an instructor somewhere. When you become instructor, be a good one... likely to go to a number of courses/ attachments (but certainly not airborne ). You will find out what I mean. This was my career path !<br><br>In reservist... well , another matter. I have seen friends retrained from signaller to combat medic. From infantry to combat engr. Even stranger retraining have taken place (but can't mention as sensitive). There are conversion courses. But this depends I believe on your post NS education, the manpower requirements in the reserves, and of course your last NSF posting before ORD.</div>

(timing is also critical I suspect). I was infantry platoon sergeant in NSF days. Went overseas to do  a degree. Came back and notified Personnel Centre and they asked me for the degree qualifications. A few weeks later the SAF 100 came asking me to report for duty in a brand new unit ... no longer infantry.  A reservist appointment that required a infantry senior NCO with my background, but not in the Army  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"> , can't say too much... sorry.<br>Many others in my reserve unit this way... 70 - 80% NCOs and officers this way. Some are more kilat than me... ex CDO, ex GDS. Their education/ civilian job, plus their infantry training helped them change "vocation".<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>No I think it depends, xiao mao... like I said it is timing and your post -NSF career.<br><br>My reservist platoon signaller got posted into my unit because of his job. I can't say what his job is in civilian life.. as someone will guess what we do, but he was one example where altho' he did not further his education, he got into my unit because of his civvy skills plus his signals training.<br><br>My SISPEC friend (last time known as SAFINCOS) is a captain today in reservist because he trained as a medical doctor after NSF. This may not be a good example, but I say this because this is a first hand story. I have heard of other stories.</div>

You can try writing in to NSPC (supposed to be a new Army now... so they are supposed to be open to suggestions !!!) and ask for a vocation more suited to your job and NSF vocation. Do it before they send you your first SAF 100, if you really want to. Once they send you your SAF 100, the chances are very very slim.<br><br>Of course, they will not agree,  if you were originally a PES A infantry man, and still  fit , and your civilian vocation is mechanical engineer, so quite common job, and then you write in to "volunteer" for being a cook/ GD man in the Army.<br><br>But something realistic... for example I know SQ pilots have wrote in to serve in the Air Force , not as pilot but other aviation related jobs.<br>But NSPC will still screen you,because they do not want to loose good soldier material that will be better off  for the SAF, staying in a combat vocation.</div>
