            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote>todae straits time also publish an article about malaysia and indonesia being 'best friends' as something necessary</blockquote>Don`t count on it. They have`nt exactly been the best of buddies in the past and certainly not now. We are definitely closer to Indonesia; especially during the Suharto era.  They have teething issues with Thailand, Brunei and as far as Australia(on issues as diverse as Australia`s native people..thks to Dr M). Not too long ago, DPM Najib declared that China is a naturally ally of Malaysia. They did`nt exactly got a nod from China so that was kind of malu. Can you say bizzare statements come from the north from time to time.<br><br>But it`s important that some semblance of good ties exist between Malaysia and Indonesia.<br><br>International treaties and law is very important if you want credibility and influence in the global scene. But what has been happenning seems to me like some kind of kampong politics transplanted into the world stage where `face' matters a lot. I don`t think they have had a good record in getting good people to come forward to serve.  Anyway, kudos to our guys at the MFA for maintaining thier professionalism; otherwise it could turn out to be a shout fight in a wet-market. That`s the image I get each time they start this routine with whichever country it is. They`re not helping themselves definitely. And they should know thier place.</div>

This would render the Malaysia Singapore Second Crossing pointless.  But then again, the Causeway is causing a lot of environmental headaches, among others, nowadays.  Replacing it with a bridge would alleviate some of the associated environmental issues.  Isn't this a good enough excuse to replace the Causeway with a bridge?  Since SG is dragging her feet over this issue, don't discount on MY building a crooked bridge.  There's no issue with ITLOS or whatever law as MY is not considering to make do with the Causeway.  MY is merely building a crooked bridge to replace her part of the Causeway.  For this, MY does not need SG's consent.

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote>But why SG dragging her feet?</blockquote>To be honest, Im wondering why too seeing as such we are not the ones who want to build the bridge and still have to fork out a half a billion dollars. You might want to add that water supply(!), traffic, trade, etc might be affected plus maybe the cause of pollution is not the causeway among other things. ..Don`t forget it`s an international institution which cannot be demolished without the prior agreement of both parties.<br><br>And the manner with which the matter has been dealt thus far from the other side of the causeway is really a model on diplomatic initiative and cooperation. It ought to be on the first page followed by far more elaborated and complicated models. Easy ones from first the page and with the difficult ones last.<br><br>To me, if a crooked bridge is somehow built in the end, it is a symbol of blemished ties made physical for all to see for generations to come.  That`s truly regrettable.<br><br>Anyhow, most of those points are up there...somewhere.<br><br><blockquote>Ohhh Really?</blockquote>Closing the borders would hurt both sides a lot really.
