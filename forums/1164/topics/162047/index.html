            <div class='col-md body'><strong><a href="http://www.mfa.gov.sg/internet/" rel="nofollow">FACTS</a></strong><br>In Parliament on 17 October 2005,Sg  Foreign  Minister Yeo had replied that the implications of building a half-bridge, without Singapore's consent, would be <strong>"serious".</strong> Minister Yeo explained that Malaysia's decision to construct a half-bridge had to comply with the principles enunciated in the Order issued by the International Tribunal for the Law of the Sea (ITLOS) on 8 October 2003. Any action also had to be fully consistent with the requirements of international law governing such matters. International facilities, such as the Causeway, could not be lawfully demolished without the approval, agreement and involvement of both States concerned.<br><br>Former Malaysian PM Tun Dr Mahathir Mohamad's comments that Singapore<strong> "is getting bolder now that they could even threaten us", </strong>which appeared in Utusan Malaysia on 6 November 2005, the MFA Spokesman said:<br><br>Yeo said he was surprised and dismayed to hear that former Malaysian Prime Minister Tun Dr Mahathir Mohamad had interpreted his response to supplementary questions in Parliament as a "threat".<br><br>Since October 2003 Singapore has reminded Malaysia of its obligations under ITLOS through several Third Party Notes (TPNs).<br>Minister Yeo's point about the implications of building a half-bridge without Singapore's agreement was not a "threat". It was to highlight the serious legal implications which such a move would have under ITLOS."<br><br>MINISTRY OF FOREIGN AFFAIRS<br>SINGAPORE<br>8 NOVEMBER 2005 .

IMO, its stupid cos if we don't wanna build, then u can't build either.  This a bridge, not ur house door.  To build bridges to link 2 countries, u gotta have a cooperation between the 2 countries... where got such thing as build half  bridge one...<br><br>This is a really retarded problem.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I read the comments by Dr M&amp;M with disgust. How can he saying we are getting bolder and are threatening them? We are merely reminding them that tearing the causeway without our consent is illegal. Causeway is an international structure, not their bridge. We reserve our rights to pursue the matter to ICJ. That's why we are reminding them because going to court is troublesome. And according to dictionary, to threaten is to be a source of danger to. Why he likes to keep using such strong words to describe Singapore? This is not good for both government. May I remind him that he is now a commoner like we do. Maybe the Malaysian government should detain him under ISA as he is deemed a threat, at least to me, to the Malaysian government because he always talks rubbish.<br><br>We are a sovereign country and we can make our own decision. Our stand is that the cost of building a new bridge needs to be justified. Is there any wrong? Will he pay millions of dollars to buy a thing which he doesn't need? Maybe for him, yes. Remember lots of white elephant projects in Malaysia during his rule?<br><br>A recent commentary by their newspaper states that rebuilding the Causeway will solve the pollution problem. I wonder how it's going to solve it. Yes to a certain extend the problem will be alleviate but where does the pollutants in the water go? They will still be in the water to harm the environment. The real way to deal with the problem is to clean up the source. And I remind them that most, if not all the source are in Johor. Maybe they should ask for comments from our primary school kids before using that as a reason to justify the tearing of the causeway. The commentary also states that 1 suggestion to allow RSAF jets fly to South China Sea via Johor to justify our spending is a disguise to spy on Johor. Is there anything for us to spy on in Johor? If we really need reconnaissance photos of Johor, we simply pay commercial companies to do the job or just download the free Google Earth software and use it.<br><br>Dr M&amp;M had set a very bad example for their media. Can their media not learn his way of talking and try to write something more constructive and not speculate about the ongoing discussions.</div>

It is illegal for MY to do so because the causeway IS an international structure. We have no problems with going to court over this, then MY will start saying SG unfriendly and all that crap. Ultimate losers are all of us tax payers (SG and MY) as we will be footing the bills for this ridiculous court battles.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"></div>

Our 3rd, 6th, 9th, 21st division are roaring to push their way into Johor till Meksing. As MM Lee had say years before that if our water supplies are interrupted, we will go to war with whichever countries that cut our supply. But for the time being, war is not on the cards as we are now almost self sufficient.<br><br>But what has it got to do with water supplies when we are talking about causeway. Surely they can't be so stupid to tear their side of causeway together with the pipes. They wouldn't want to face our army when all the ordered equipment haven't even arrive.[/quote]</div>
