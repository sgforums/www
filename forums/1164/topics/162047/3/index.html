            <div class='col-md body'>The port issue may become a non-issue if Thailand builds a canal through the Isthmus of Kra to bypass both Singapore and Malaysia. It will cut shipping times drastically without having to pass through the pirate-infested Straits of Malacca.<br><br>Here are some excerpts from an article readers might be interested in:<br><br>"In 1882 the constructor of the Suez canal, Ferdinand de Lesseps, visited the area, but wasn't allowed to investigate in detail by the Thai king.  In 1897 Thailand and the British empire agreed not to build a canal there, to protect the regional dominance of the harbour of Singapore."<br><br>"In 2005, however, an internal report prepared for U.S. Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld was leaked to The Washington Times, spelling out China's strategy of underwriting construction of the $20 billion canal across the Kra Isthmus complete with Chinese port facilities, as part of its "string of pearls" strategy of forward bases and energy security."<br><br>http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kra_Isthmus<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>You`re right Banana. If you`re bothered by Dr M`s remarks, then he would already have scored points with you. He was a loose cannon in international politics during his twilight years as PM. After some time, the world stopped according his statements the credence and importance we we once showed. In many ways, he belittled Malaysia`s position in international diplomacy. Not very much helped by Syed Hamid Albar, the foreign minister, I must add.  Too bad. It certainly helped our standing ironically. Wonder if it ever occured to them...<br><br>At any rate, they can`t legally demolish the cause-way on thier side. And I seriously doubt they would. It seriously damages international standing.<br>It would be no different then Egypt blocking one end of the Suez canal and claiming that they have a right to do so. The example of the Suez is`nt far-fetched. It`s a matter of principle and agreement and that matters hell of a lot in diplomacy. At the end of the day, Malaysia would be deemed as an untrustworthy party and that`s crazy.  Again, Singapore benefits somewhat.<br><br>It makes a mockery of the global community. So, the affect are wide-ranging on a whole slew of agreements; politics, economics, etc.  For example, who wants to negotiate a free trade agreement with you when you can change your mind after sigining the dotted line.<br><br>I forgot to add. Most people in the know will probably laugh thier hats off when Malaysia goes on a sabre-rattling dance. Be it against Singapore, Indonesia, Australia, etc. You know why..funny shiit</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I dun think Kras Canal will be build within the next decade or so. The current insurgent activity in south thailand has shaken the nerve of the Thai rulers. No Thai leader is willing to risk building the Kras Canal and face the possibility of losing the control of south Thailand.<br><br>Remember not too long ago, our dear Dr M even offered to help the Thai gov to "train" the south thailand local adminstration staff for better efficiency...sounds very very fishy</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Reports about the Kra canal floats around the internet. Same with several other proposals to shorten distances around the world. It`s about matching ideas with reality. All in, these are difficult to implement(with many implications) and costly.  Thus far, there has not been any move in that direction. Indeed, it is seriously becoming a non-viable option; even if Thailand was entertaining this notion in the first place. You don`t want to seperate a troublesome  muslim south from the mainly Buddhist north.  Also, which ship wants to pass through a region torn by rebellion and strife. On the report on China`s funding it, I would put it together with the reports on turning Singapore into a southern out-post as part of a grand US strategy to contain China. Not very helpful in terms of credibility. Lots of rhetoric from many people within and outside the government as these two giants learn to accomodate one another. Not much sense sometimes. Also, 20 billion is`nt cheap even by China`s standards and to have it in Chinese hands will not be acceptable to Thailand`s soveriegnty and a treaty US-ally at that.<br><br>Meanwhile, we are getting our money as usual and making profits as well from our ports. Whatever happened to PTP? Have`nt heard about it for a long time still. Same thing with most of the ventures they seem to get thier hands on. I think it`s generally about competition and it`s just something they are doing a poor job in.<br><br>So people keep on quoting these examples; especially with our neighbours in the north; in same vein as they keep saying that they want to cut water-supply, increase the costs, stop reclaimation,etc. Truth is. They can`t because they could`nt afford the repurcussions.  And in the instances which they could hope do something, they have`nt been successful. The new Tekong wil look great. So really...we have lots to cheer about at thier periodic demonstrations of desperation. Most notably, from Dr M.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>They always pick on us, tiny island with no resources.   Sometimes i even think race problems may be exaggerated and influenced by external parties out to create inbalance.   We have to be self sufficient and PAP now is also too snob in the eyes of our neighbours.  We always talk about treaty and international law.  But our neighbours may not like it.  They like contract without fixed price and up to them to change and also this bridge, even two houses join at the wall also needs to get approval between owners just to made any modification.  What they say we must follow.  i guess in their heart, they have not really let go of us yet.<br><br>when any parties want to do any project which involves the other party, a formal written proposal must be issue and spelt out clearly and sign by johore and KL.  Next if johore becomes independant, but contract with federal can be void.  The water contract is with johore and singapore, but somehow transfer to KL.  If one day PAS wins in johore, then how?  They can denied all informal contracts by federal and BN.<br><br>I guess they have run out of projects, thats why in a rush to build the CQ.  What happens the bridge can only be build 300m to the left of the CW due to problems., then they cannot shift the CQ on the right.<br><br>i think a new bridge will be great but must mutually benefit both parties and must be free, no toll for all vehicles and people.</div>
