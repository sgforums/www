            <div class='col-md body'>I'm sure we've seen some of the reports.<br><br>I've read thru quite a few of them... and I'm wondering, why did SAF heli-evac the casualties from pulau tekong to SGH instead of CGH. CGH is nearer right? And SOP in Tekong MC does state CGH right?<br><br>Is it true that CGH does not have Heli-evac A&amp;E facilities?<br><br>If SAF choppers carrying casualties from tekong could bring them to CGH, precious minutes can be saved.  Minutes means a lot in a life and death situation.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>hey shotgun. i believe u were EH's friend right? remember me?<br><br>anyways, to answer your question, i believe that is because the medical facilities in CGH aren't as up to date as those in SGH.

I speak from xp .. after spending my NS in that camp.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br><br>Anyway the least they could do is consider landing the chopper in that camp.

            <div class='col-md body'>As of SOP , that tekong MC state CGH, that is for the normal case, anything that need helicopter is special cases that is up to the MO to decide and the helicopter to decide.<br><br>First thing there is a lot of consideration, not just on the hospital equipments and specialized available for that type of treatment.<br><br>Even you have landing area for heli in changi !  You must consider the flight path, how easy to land .<br><br>Yes changi may be near, but it is directly near the airport, which mean if you want to try to land at CGH, you have to wait for control towers to clear you a flight path from the taking off and landing commerical planes.  In the end, the faster way may be SGH instead, which does not require hold for flight path clearance, and no disruption to the commerical traffic and the no danger to heli.<br><br>As for how fast a heli can get to tekong, there is alway 1 or 2 helicopter on standby for emergency cases. Once activitated, the pilots need quick briefing and crew need to start the heli, like i say the rest is depend on the flight path clearance to how fast they can reach there.<br><br></div>
