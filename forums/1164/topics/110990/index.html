I do doubt that they bother to bless a few only (or bless one by one). Also, part of the reason the crests are blessed could (in my opinion) be more to do with cultural reasons and military tradition then superstition. In medieval times, knights/warriors etc... were blessed before going into battle, their banners/flags etc were also blessed. Could the blessing of crests could be an extension of this tradition?<br><br>Culturally, I think a person, even those who profess to be adverse to violence, will fight in combat (or train to fight) if he knows his actions have been sanctioned or approved by his religion. Thus, the blessing of crests &amp; colours could be interpreted as the major religions "approval" of the SAF &amp; NS.<br><br>I also kind of doubt that decisions in the SAF would be made entirely on account of superstition. While many officers and warrants will probably be cautious and respectful, I don't think an entire ex would be halted on account of an appearance.<br><br>Well, just my opines.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>imo you are t3h correct! <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz"><br><br>Also, The blessings may be done only to assuage the supertitious soldiers. Esp since when the first blessings were done, soldiers were alot more superstitious (probably) than today. Another thing is they might just be hedging their bets. It may work, prob not but why not just do it type of argument.<br><br>As for the Supernatural, i've never heard nor seen any in my NS days unless you mean the abnormal abundance of smelly genitilia (hearsay), or unnatural sexual practices (hearsay, esp after some happy hour) or unatural ability to run under 9:15.&lt;----THAT is pretty damn Supernatural to me. That will also account for Hendon Camp having quite alot of supernatural incidents.<img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br><br>I seriously doubt an EX was stopped just coz a pontianak/plastic bag was seen on a tree. Unless you mean stopped because its a live firing exercise and they dunno what the hell someone is doing inside the Live firing area.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>Army officer testifies at SPI website[b/]<br><br><a href="http://www.spi.com.sg/stories/colin_recruit/main.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.spi.com.sg/stories/colin_recruit/main.htm</a><br><br>[b]Being a army officer stationed in Pulau Tekong, I (Platoon commander Colin, formerly of Delta Company Camp 1) have to take special induction training courses in order to perform my duties as a platoon commander.<br><br>In one special session, which I unfortunately missed, but my fellow officers told me, it involved a Mindef Directives on not conducting training on Thursday nights. The reasons cited included an increased risk in accidents, injuries and incidents occurring in Thursday Trainings in the evening. The session included an actual case study of a mysterious death of an army recruit. The incident supposedly occurred in the 1970s.<br><br>Basically it involved the incident of a recruit who went missing halfway through a route march. First the platoon, then the company, then the camp, and eventually the entire island was mobilized to look for him. They found him the next day, with his body disemboweled, along the route of the route march.<br><br>I am aware there is a 3 door bunk in Charlie Company. I am not aware there is a connection with this story I just mentioned. I believe that the 3 door could have been built for a reason, whether paranormal or not.</strong><br></div>
