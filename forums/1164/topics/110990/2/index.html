About 6- 7 years back, an Arty unit was training in Thailand and successfully massacred 100's of cows.<br>The scary part was that if the sights were slightly more misaligned, the village would have been caught in the path.  It was only a hundred metres or so away.<br>Needless to say, SAF paid out more than a million in compensation (the villagers must have been very happy).  That unit, which was due to receive Best Unit never got the award although the fault was due to some issues with the sights on the gun shifting after firing.</div>

Land rovers cannot start lah, excavators also cannot start. Only after the officers pray and give offerings then the machines can start.<br>If you talk about pontianak, I have encounterd before but never see the face.Her scream is enough to haunt me for a long time.If anyone have relatives or friends who was once in the police force guarding the towers of changi prison back in the late 70s, they surely got pontianak tales to tell you.<br><br>DUST OF AN ANGEL<br>ANGELDUST</div></blockquote>So have u heard of  a story which happened  in the early 80s?.Supposedly it happened in a HDB neighbourhood when a woman who died during childbirth at Tan Tock Seng Hospital came back as a pontianak and knocked on the door of her house a few days later in the wee hours of the night?...The terrified family knew it was her as they peeped thru the doorhole and refused to let her in....One of the uncles in the family shouted at her to  go away and not to return ....Later "she" just went away and in the next few days they called in a Bomoh to exorcize the house..It was reported that  some neighbours saw "her" on the night she came back...This story was told to me when i was young  by my Grandma and was supposedly true..</div>

About 6- 7 years back, an Arty unit was training in Thailand and successfully massacred 100's of cows.<br>The scary part was that if the sights were slightly more misaligned, the village would have been caught in the path.  It was only a hundred metres or so away.<br>Needless to say, SAF paid out more than a million in compensation (the villagers must have been very happy).  That unit, which was due to receive Best Unit never got the award although the fault was due to some issues with the sights on the gun shifting after firing.</div></blockquote>from what i know, the cow story is due not to any arty, but a stray CIS40 round. the farmer was very very well compensated.</div>
