            <div class='col-md body'>ya my bf did got ask to sign on and he tried to but got rejected.<br><br>because he tried to change his course halfway in poly and end up with no diploma by the mistake of his lecturer . when he realise it , he was sent to completed ns service.<br>now he is bounce back to o levels .<br><br>plus he wasted the diploma fees and gov tution fund . &gt;.&lt;<br><br>so he tot he might as well sign up for a post in combat section I think but got rejected due to low education and PR status. because of  low education he is also not accpeted in ocs...<br><br>so he tot in worse situation is if he could join as singapore citizen and do an application again .<br><br>he is currently only holding 3rd sergent rank in bmt..<br>so I asked if he want to sign up for logistic like some of my friend's bf but he is kindda pondering over it ....<br><br>but over all I think it is really a tough road if he was to go redo his diploma after he completed ns without a big financal problem . and only to start finidng a job at 27 years old ..<br><br>so if there is a better way for him at least he can try ..<br><br>then again of course if he is willin got sign up and find the post suitable for him , not trying to force him.</div>
