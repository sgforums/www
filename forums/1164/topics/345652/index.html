              <p>It is a more of a  surprise if we know that  our marksmanship is not on par with other armies in the region &amp; we do nothing to address it.  I read many posts in this forum about  how advanced Singapore is in weapons , military capabilities etc.  Sadly, there has been very little reaction on our poor  showing in the most basic of  soldiering skills.   </p>
              <p>If lack of live ranges is  the reason for not having good marksmen, then we shud have more ranges. One less F16 can build many effective modern ranges.  Are not  our infantry soldiers already "wedded " to their rifles so they have total access to their rifle. </p>
              <p>US Marines &amp; the British Army pride themselves on their marksmanship.  We probably shud learn from them .</p>

              <p>a little comment from me here. i heard this one from me encik, so have no idea how true is this but we must consider one thing.</p>
              <p>SAF sends a different contigent to these shoot meets every year. the team is culled from the best of the division level. these guys are just better than your average trooper and not specialized marksman.</p>
              <p>OTOH, for e.g the team from other nations tend to be full time professional shooters. i.e, exclusive shoot team. their sole job is to train for marksmanship competitions.</p>
              <p>and that these shooters often go on to become representatives for their nations in shooting at regional level and global level sports event. the army team is more like a feeder team for their respective national teams.</p>
              <p>dont think we can draw too much comparison between them and us. or read too much into its significance assuming that the 2nd fact is accurate. besides, what good is a you shoot me i return fire mode of battle nowadays ? the trend and buzzword is, you shoot me i call the full firepower of NCW on you. i just return fire to cover my ass.</p>

              <p>Does not  the SAF also have professionals as are the regulars ?  </p>
              <p>Our best pistol shooter is a regular commando who represents SAF in these meets too.  So I suppose we can do as well ( &amp; we shud )  with our rifle teams.   Looking at the rifle meet results, it was a very very poor showing.</p>
              <p>Making full use of our advantage of technology is good. We shud never fight fair and if we have the technology to fight  unfairly  and win we shud use it. No argument here.     </p>
              <p>The opponents also have brains &amp; advantage in technology can be circumvented. It then boils down to the foot soldier with a rifle ,  fighting spirit , courage  &amp; skill.  There are so many examples how riflemen can change the course of battle.  The infantryman are holding the  assymetric battlelines in Afghanistan  &amp;  Iraq.  </p>

              <p>Individual competitions are not a fair indication of the actual skill levels of the whole organisation.</p>
              <p>It's like saying that because Lance Armstrong is such a formidable Tour de France champion, than Americans must be very good road cyclist too ... when for the most, Americans hardly cycle.</p>
              <p>A fairer indication of Organisational Marksmenship skill will be:</p>
              <p>i) Organisational Philosophy and training emphasis.  eg. the USMC</p>
              <p>ii) Actual levels of Training resources devoted to marksmenship training.  I have heard, anecdotally, that a SAF NSMen fires more rounds in a ICT range then the typical MAF soldier does in a year.  Don't know how true this is.</p>
              <p>iii) Actual testing standards and shooting test pass rate for the Organisation.  Now this will be a real indication of the marksmenship level and an interesting statistic to get hold of.</p>

              <p><br>I am not stating a fact .. I am stating my own personal opinion. =)</p>
              <p>But think about this .. for a small country like Singapore .. with firearms banned and only National Shooting Centre available for selected civilians and soldiers, police officers to use .. and with Airsoft and paintball skirmishes banned .. compared to all our Asean neighbours .. who have paintball, airsoft , live ranges for commercial purposes and their military ranges .. seriously .. I honestly think we Singaporeans are not that exposed to shooting ..</p>
              <p>My own opinion. Cheers</p>

              <p>AARM should be like a tropical version of the winter olympic biathlon aka cross country plus shooting.  only then will it be of any relevance to the armed forces.</p>

              <p>in any case, as each of the team competing was on equal footing, naturally there'll be winners and losers.  in real combat, each of the team could very well hold their own and achieve their set objectives.</p>

              <p>Unfortunately, competitions DO reflect  the level of  skill / competence in the organization.  After all, the best in the organization are sent to participate in these competitions.   Correct me if I am wrong, but it looks as if the SAF contingent  in this meet comprised a vast majority of regulars. Regulars  &amp; good NSF shooters are given time and resources to train for these competitions &amp; they are  the best shooters the SAF has to offer.</p>
              <p>Lance Armstrong is / was the best long distance  professional cyclist in the world. But it is certain that there are many  world class cyclists like him from his country - their numbers can probably be seen  in  the nationalities of  the top ten or world class cyclists. Also, his call to fame is on the Tour De France which is but one cycling event in the cycling calendar. </p>
              <p>Cyberpioneer need not report lame excuses -  Was the SAF the only contingent  that were affected by the "conditions" ?  </p>
              <p>We need not come out  1st for events , but I think a good showing will be when we have MANY of our particiapants ending up in the top five positions in many events. This kind of outcome then really shows that the organization as a whole has many good shooters. Being first is great but it may be because the individual is  just plain exceptional.   </p>
              <p>We were not allowed to use SAR 21 ?   Now if this is true, then the rifle results are seriously flawed  !  And if so why not ?  Was this in the rules of the competition  ?  Can someone verify as I wud have thought that standard issue rifles wud be allowed . In this case the Malaysians wud also have been disadvantaged if they were not allowed to use AUGs with standard 1.5 X scopes. </p>

              <p>i quite disagree. its abit like the SEA games. Host nation has the right to host / create special event which benefits them. like i remembered one year, SEA games actually had a chapteh competition. It was hosted by vietnam or loas i think.</p>
              <p>which is why no one seriouslly accords these arms meets any significance. its useful as it helps to promote semi-formal ties and interactions between the different forces, disspiating potential tensions between institutions/nation-states (although the idea is there, its somewhat contestable in practice and in effect)</p>

              <p>The rules of the competition are in the same website that I linked you to for the competition results.  They specifically state "no iron sights" <span style="color: #ff0000;">[edit: The rules states "<strong>Only</strong> Iron Sights"]</span> ... although they do allow quite a bit of leeway in other aspects.  The idea is not to let technology (of the rifle) overly influence what is primarily a shooter competition.</p>
              <p>If you look at the results of the Rifle category, Malaysia did as badly as Singapore did.  I don't know if any inference can be made from that with regards to disadvataged for these 2 contingents with scoped service rifles.</p>

              <p>No.  All shooters are equally affected by these conditions.</p>
              <p>However, I believe that the SAF shooters may be the only contingent that trains predominantly in baffled ranges as opposed to outdoor ranges. So perhaps the SAF contingent is more significantly affected by windy conditions since windage adjustment is not something that they are sued to ... as compared to a shooter who's been shooting outdoors all their life.</p>

              <blockquote>
              <p>Unfortunately, competitions DO reflect  the level
                      of  skill / competence in the organization.  After all,
                      the best in the organization are sent to participate in these
                      competitions.   Correct me if I am wrong, but it
                      looks as if the SAF contingent  in this meet comprised a vast
                      majority of regulars. Regulars  &amp; good NSF shooters are
                      given time and resources to train for these competitions &amp; they
                      are  the best shooters the SAF has to offer.</p>
              <p>We need not come out  1st for events , but I think a good
                      showing will be when we have MANY of our
                      particiapants ending up in the top five positions in many
                      events. This kind of outcome then really shows that the
                      organization as a whole has many good shooters. Being
                      first is great but it may be because the individual is
                       just plain exceptional.   </p>
              </blockquote>
              <p>If you re-read my post, you will find that I did not say that Individual Performances DO NOT reflect competence of an organisation.  I merely stated that they are not a fair evaluation and offered other, IMO, better measures of organisational competence.</p>
              <p>The performances of a FEW selected individuals (the BEST shooters), only represent one end of the bell curve that reflects the organisation's performance level.  What is more important is the shape of the bell curve behind those top few ... which will then indicate more concisely the true level of the organisation's competence.</p>
              <p>To take another example, let's assume 2 fictitous units 7 PDF HQ and 999 Battalion Singapore Guards.</p>
              <p>7 PDF HQ is mostly PES C personnel but with 3 NSF National Grade runners attached, so that their training does not interrupt unit training.  7PDF HQ has an overall  50% pass rate for IPPT with only 3% Gold.</p>
              <p>999 BSG is a combat unit with no National Grade athletes attached.  They managed a 97% IPPT Pass rate with 50% Gold standard.</p>
              <p>In the Army Half Marathon, each unit is invited to send their 3 best runners for a inter-unit competition.</p>
              <p>The 7PDF runners come in 1,2 and 5th ... the 999 BSG runners come in 8, 15 and 21st.</p>
              <p>Is it fair to infer from the Army Half marathon results that 999 BSG has issues with fitness that need to be addressed?  Or is it better to use the IPPT results?</p>
              <p>The larger your sample population, the better your correlation.</p>
              <p>But I do agree that a good showing is important ... if for nothing other than "face".  Explaining a lose is just poor form.</p>

              <p>Choto ... paintball is banned in Singapore?  Google "Singapore Paintball" ... you'll be surprised.<br><br>In any case, paintball, airsoft and laser tags are hardly good marksmenship training.  They usually have poor sights and tend to be more "spray and pray" than "aim and shoot".  But they are useful for exposing lay people to small unit tactical dynamics.<br><br>wrt NSC and private shooting facilities, Singapore's NSC is open to all.  You just have to pay but anyone can join ... this is as far as I can remember, when I last inquired about owning and shooting a shotgun in Singapore.  I may have gotten organisation names/acronyms wrong but I was specifically told anyone (barring the usual suspects) can join and own a gun ... just that the gun has to be kept at therange and not at home.<br><br>I'd venture an opinion that the situation in Asean is not much more advantageous than Singapore's.  Comparing to 2 countries that I'm relatively familiar with, Malaysia &amp; Philippines.  Private gun ownership is less restrictive compared to Singapore.  But the process of ownership is such that LEGAL gun ownership is really only the purvue of the rich ... who don't form a significant portion of the population.  ILLEGAL gun ownership is more rampant than Singapore, but illegal guns tend to be of the homemade pipegun (seriously) variety ... again not condusive to citizenry marksmenship.  Which again really means that exposure to proper shooting is really only within a small portion of their upper socio-economic population.<br><br>OTOH, Singapore schools have recently gone for air-rifles in a big way.  Even when I was in Sec School yonks ago, there were already a lot of air rifle clubs ... just that now, the training and equipment levels are much better.  I'd suggest that this exposes a larger portion of the population to marksmenship principles than the private gun ownership in ASEAN.  Martial value of Air Rifle Club is sh!t though. ;)<br><br>I also suspect that at the military level, we actually spend more, per capita (soldier), on marksmenship training compared to our neighbours.  A large part of that may simply be because we have better overall funding.<br><br>The US will be a vastly better example of basic musketry skills in the population - Gun ownership by the middle class, large number of private ranges, legal hunting seasons.</p>

              <p>short of living in america, or some failed state in the third world with civil war and total anarchy, i think no person can feel "overexposed" to legal firearms. its really a relative thing.</p>
              <p>look on the brightside. at least the per capita knowledge of firearms and basic technical arms proficiency should be in the high 40 percentile range of the population. (i.e almost half the population knows the basic skills in handling a rifle and shooting)</p>

              <p>The above reasoning is based on an attribute which cannot be changed  -  fitness or medical condition ( or lack of it in the example ) . Unfortunately, one cannot change many of those classified as PES C  to PES A.</p>

              <p>Also, the population size in this case is the whole SG Army.   It is a large pool to draw from to get good shooters.</p>
              <p>I look forward to the day when SAF hosts the AARM. We can then use scoped standard issue rifles and baffled ranges among other "advantages "  &amp; bag the prizes.</p>
