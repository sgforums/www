            <div class='col-md body'>This shouldn't be much of a surprise as the Raptor have been designed with stealth in mind. Maneourvability is sacrificed for stealth. The Raptor survives by trying to avoid being detected and thus being drawn into a close proximity gun-fight.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"></div>

The F117 was detected by the British during GW1. Then, please remember in the opening shots of the "Shock 'n' Awe" by the F117s in Iraq.

Hence the Air Raid Sirens went off when the Jammings were detected.<br><br>However, they soon realised that the F-117s were actually effective, and later in the 100hr war, they stopped the jamming when the F-117s were about to attack.  It did result in a much shorten reaction time, hence less anti aircraft fire.<br><br>Conceded though, the stealth technology is not PERFECT by anymeans.  It simply means that its harder to detect the aircraft via CONVENTIONAL radar and ADA networks.  Every technological development will unavoidably lead to further counter-developments. Every action will result in an equal an opposite reaction. Unavoidably.<br><br>The opening shot in the first gulf war, was carried out by UAVs carrying B-52 transponders, and waves of AGM-88s behind.  It lit up the KARI network and wiped out the french built system in one night.  No kidding the air raid sirens went off.... seeing swarms of "B-52s"<br><br>Warfare is now "network" centric.  U dun have to have the ULTIMATE super agile fighter to win a fight.  I personally don't think the F-22 is such an aircraft.  But its data links, stealth, as well as man-machine interface, allows it to complement a network centric system.<br><br>About the amount of G-s the aircraft were pulling... neither was pulling too hard.  It looked to me that the Hornet was trying to take a quick snap shot, which he luckily GOT as the F-22 sailed into his gun pipper.  At 180kts, he's gonna go straight and get some airspeed right after he passes the F-22.  He doesn't have time or airspeed to roll right, and pull a high-g gun pass at the F-22.  I'm guessing the F-18 went up and over....</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I think the whole saga is just stupid anyway. The naval aviator trying to prove he can get a shot at the Raptor. Heck, anyone can get any gun shot at anybody...look at the Israeli pilots during the 50s and the 60s, their gun kills were not achieved because they had better planes, it was all about tactics and the pilots' skills.<br><br>In real war, the Raptor would be flown differently and with their thrust vectoring and their advanced avionics (plus JHMCS/AIM-9X) I will be suprised if they don't eat 95% of their enemies 1st past. Seriously. if a Raptor driver is crap (which I don't think so as they are handpicked), then it is a totally different story. BTW, there is also such things as luck - "being at the right place, at the right time". Even ace pilots can be shot down!</div>
