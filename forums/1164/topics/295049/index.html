            <div class='col-md body'>The Ford Everst is chosen based on a few factors.<br><br>1) Avaliability and cost of spare parts<br>Since this is already a commercial civilian vehicle, therefore supply of spare parts is not a problem and cost will as the result be low.<br><br>2) Potential lower cost of maintainence and servicing<br>The SAF is very likely to outsource this to the civilian garages. This way they can save on manpower and cut down on cost as usually the lowest bidder gets the contract.<br><br>3) Fuel efficiency and cost savings<br>It is a much newer vehicle with a new engine as compare to the rover. So fuel efficiency will be good which will in turn cut down on diesel. Fuel prices won't drop to those in the 80s (when the Rover is first introduced) any time soon.<br><br>4) Crew comfort<br>The whole vehicle is air-conditioned.<br><br>5) Performance<br>Assuming we chose the 4x4 model, that will make this a capable off road vehicle.</div>

I wonder how long it will take before the Fords start smelling as bad as the Rovers? i will always remember the smell, a mix of oil, rubber, sweat and stagnant water, and occassionally 'wet dog', especially after the dogs had been loaded for guard duty. Ew...<br><br>I will miss the rovers tho. Still remember hiding out in the rovers during heavy rain and watching the widscreen fog up while out in the bushes.... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"></div>
