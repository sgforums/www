I read somewhere before, that it was not exactly an engineering defect.  The aussies wanted it to be ultra quiet at low speeds, and that was what was delivered.<br><br>Anyways, even if the RSN did encounter problems that requires a certain class of vessel to be docked, we wouldn't hear about it at all.</div>
