              <p><span> Japanese Prime Minister Yoshihiko Noda
               ordered Japan's Self Defense Forces (JSDF) to be <strong>fully prepared for any
               emergency</strong> under the complex peripheral security environment at the 
              Ministry of Defense Tuesday morning.</span></p>
              <p><span>Noda reviewed the guards of honor of JSDF inside the 
              Ministry of Defense, and then attended a senior commander meeting of 
              JSDF, accompanied by the Defense Minister Satoshi Morimoto.</span></p>
              <p><span>Noda made a speech to about 180 senior commanders of JSDF at the meeting.</span></p>
              <p><span>In the speech, Noda said the uncertainties over 
              Japan's peripheral security environment rose to the highest level as the
               military activity of surrounding countries, including Democratic 
              People's Republic of Korea, China and Russia, became more active, thus JSDF should monitor and analyze the countries closely.</span></p>
              <p><span>He particularly mentioned that China has been increasingly active in surrounding seas.</span></p>
              <p><span>The Japanese government has exchanged the official contract on the purchase of Diaoyu Islands with Kurihara family whom the Japanese side called "the private owner" Tuesday morning, despite strong protest from China.</span></p>
              <p><span>The Japanese government will pay the expense of 2.05 
              billion yen (26.15 million U.S. dollars) with government reserve funds 
              to the Kurihara family, who claims to own the Diaoyu Islands in the East
               China Sea.</span></p>
              <p><span>Demonstrating China's undisputable sovereignty over 
              the islands, two ships of the China Marine Surveillance (CMS) reached 
              the waters around the islets Tuesday morning.</span></p>
              <p><span>The CMS has drafted an action plan for safeguarding 
              territorial sovereignty and would take actions pending the development 
              of the situation.</span></p>
              <p><span>Japan's Chief Cabinet Secretary Osamu Fujimura 
              announced Monday afternoon that the Japanese government hopes the 
              purchase would not undermine the overall bilateral relations with China.</span></p>
              <p><span>The Chinese Foreign Ministry reacted quickly on 
              Monday, saying Japan's purchase of the islands is illegal and invalid 
              and China firmly opposes the move.</span></p>
              <p><span>Chinese President Hu Jintao, during his meeting with Japanese Prime Minister Yoshihiko Noda on the sidelines of the APEC summit on Sunday, made clear China's position on relations with Japan and on the Diaoyu Islands issue.</span></p>
              <p><span>Hu pointed out that China-Japan relations had recently faced a severe situation due to the Diaoyu Islands issue. </span></p>

              <p>Now China only sends small class of warship. It is a stand-off to see who will start the engagement which will light the fire. Both sides submarines should be crusing near-by collecting as much activities of each other's forces present. The think-tank high ranking staff should creating various senarios and studying how to react to the situations. Having a good submarine forces should give the full advantage of stealth. The moment you see bigger classes of surface warship being sent to that area, it will be an all-out test of each other's weapons. PRC weapons technology versus Japanese USA weapons technology.</p>

              <p>If China could win a war at sea, it would be happy to start one. China will not be able to export anything, but Japan will be completely gone. China can survive on its domestic economy. Japan would change its tune forever, same for Korea.</p>

              <p> notes on imperial items with a carbon dating could be used to date how old the material was.so if first chinese man set foot there long ago it meant island is china territory as in international laws current.the japs only came in during 1890 or so.</p>
              <p>so its like a neighbour who comes and put his flower pots into your house door area or on your head when its really part of your space all along!</p>

              <p>The two Mongol fleets were dispatched by <a href="http://sgforums.com/EBchecked/topic/324254/Kublai-Khan"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0066cc;">Kublai Khan</span></span></a>, the grandson of <a href="http://sgforums.com/EBchecked/topic/229093/Genghis-Khan"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0066cc;">Genghis Khan</span></span></a> who had conquered China and had become the first emperor of its <a href="http://sgforums.com/EBchecked/topic/654422/Yuan-dynasty"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0066cc;">Yuan (Mongol) dynasty</span></span></a>. The first invasion force that attacked Japan in the autumn of 1274 comprised about 30,000 to 40,000 men (mostly ethnic Chinese and Koreans, except for the Mongolian officers) and an estimated 500 to 900 vessels. The typhoon struck as the ships lay at anchor in Hakata Bay, Kyushu, Japan, sinking about one-third of them, with the rest limping home; it is estimated that 13,000 of Kublai’s men drowned.</p>
              <p>The second Mongol fleet was much larger, made up of two separate forces—one setting out from Masan (Korea) and the other sailing from southern China—with a combined force of 4,400 vessels and some 140,000 soldiers and sailors. The two fleets joined up near Hakata Bay, again the main point of attack, on Aug. 12, 1281. On August 15, as they were about to assault the much smaller Japanese forces defending the island (about 40,000 samurai and other fighting men), a massive typhoon hit, wrecking the Mongol fleet and once again foiling the invasion attempt. The invading forces suffered tremendous casualties, with at least half the Mongol warriors drowning and all but a few hundred ships from the fleet perishing during the storm. Most of the men who survived the storm were hunted down and killed by the samurai over the following days. Only a small fraction of Kublai Khan’s original force returned home from this ill-fated expedition, one of the largest and most disastrous attempts at a naval invasion in history.</p>

              <p>the chinese fleet i saw had many modern and clean looking frigates each able to fire missiles from it.its a world class fleet.the japs also has a world class fleet.</p>
              <p>what would happen to spore if war happens there?firstly world will go into a recession including usa and europe.as jap n china battle one another,the $$$$ thats used to help usa and europe economy will be suspended creating a weaker economy as deva;luation in currencies occur due to lack of funding from chinese banks .when that happens the us dollar will drop and the rest of the world tied to us economy.fuel would be more expensive just to ship a ton of bricks even.nothing will be built and all countries importing goods will find it expensive,why would fuel be more expensive since its crude is from arabia?fuel is all quoted in us dollar  and even if its quoted in british or euro dollar they are all affected and thus price is raised as that will be used to justify the future losses if the currencies rise up to value which opec will not budge.</p>
              <p>so with more expensive fuel means more overly expensive food,tv,clothes etc.even a taxi ride to work will be impossible and the train services grind to a halt as they cant pay the bills due to currencies devaluation.with that most factories will close shop as they cant afford the bills to run a 3 ton machine  or even turn on the aircon or industrial systems even.means everything made will sudeddenly be way more expensive than used to be.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>all things which used to be $2 for a nasi lemak could rise to $5 even though the war with china and japan is far away.they are however the 2 countries which are poweful  and powerful figures in world economics.</p>

              <p>The standoff between <a href="http://topics.time.com/china/"><span style="color: #cc0000;">China</span></a> and <a href="http://topics.time.com/japan/"><span style="color: #cc0000;">Japan</span></a> over a group of uninhabited islets in the East China Sea continues to escalate, raising fears that the world’s second and third largest economies could stumble into armed conflict. On Friday, six Chinese patrol boats approached the Japanese-controlled islands, which are called Diaoyu in Chinese and Senkaku in Japanese. That was four more China Maritime Surveillance vessels than China had previously acknowledged dispatching to the islands northeast of <a href="http://topics.time.com/taiwan/"><span style="color: #cc0000;">Taiwan</span></a>. “It is deplorable that the invasion of the territorial waters happened at this time and we strongly request that the Chinese authorities leave our territory,” Japan’s Chief Cabinet Secretary Osamu Fujimura told reporters Friday morning.</p>
              <p>On Friday China’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs described the patrol as a “rights defense law enforcement action, to reflect the Chinese government’s jurisdiction over the Diaoyu Islands and safeguard China’s maritime rights and interests.” China was infuriated by the Japanese government’s purchase last week of three of the five islands for $26 million from a Japanese family that has claimed ownership to them for decades. China called the move illegal and a violation of Chinese sovereignty. Taiwan, which also claims the Diaoyu, accused Japan of infringing on its territory.</p>
              <p>On Friday afternoon Japan’s Kyodo News Service reported that all six of the Chinese ships had left the waters surrounding the islands, bringing a temporary easing of the dispute. But concerns remain over the potential for a clash or even an accidental collision that could see risk of fighting between the two sides. “How serious is this? It’s bloody serious,” says Ian Storey, a senior fellow at Institute of Southeast Asian Studies in Singapore. “The Chinese are incensed by this, and it comes a particularly sensitive time.”</p>
              <p>China’s ruling Communist Party has been preparing for this fall’s Communist Party congress, which is expected to see President Hu Jintao and Prime Minister Wen Jiabao begin handing over power. The man expected to take over Hu’s position, Vice President Xi Jinping, <a href="http://world.time.com/2012/09/11/chinese-puzzle-a-missing-heir-apparent-and-a-leadership-transfer-without-a-timetable/"><span style="color: #cc0000;">hasn’t been seen</span></a> in public for nearly two weeks, fanning speculation about his health and political future. Confrontation with Japan doesn’t help the harmonious image the party wants to portray during the transition, but it has no incentive to compromise on an issue of sovereignty either. “In the run-up to the party congress certainly the government can’t be seen as being weak,” says Storey. “The response would be a nationalist backlash.” At the same time, the conflict with Japan has helped draw domestic attention from questions about China’s leadership, and a robust response helps boost the Communist Party’s legitimacy. “Since the 1990s … nationalism has replaced Communism as the justification for the one-party state, which requires stirring up anti-Western – above all, anti-Japanese – sentiment,” Ian Buruma, an author and professor at Bard College, <a href="http://www.scmp.com/comment/insight-opinion/article/1036064/politics-not-historical-facts-behind-island-rows-china-japan"><span style="color: #cc0000;">wrote</span></a> in Friday’s <em>South China Morning Post</em>. “This is never difficult in China, given the painful past, and it usefully deflects public attention from the failings and frustrations of living in a dictatorship.”</p>
              <p>Anti-Japanese protests have erupted in several Chinese cities in recent weeks. On Aug. 27 a man ripped the Japanese flag from a car carrying the Japanese ambassador while it was stopped behind two vehicles in Beijing. While the rallies have remained small and closely monitored by police, there is a history of such demonstrations turning violent, as when hundreds of rioters threw rocks and smashed windows at the Japanese Embassy in Beijing in 2005. On Friday Japan repeated a warning to its citizens in China to pay attention to their personal safety, and listed six cases of Japanese being harassed or assaulted because of their nationality, including one person who had noodles dumped on them.</p>
              <p>Unlike Chinese disputes with some of its Southeast Asian neighbors over South China Sea claims, the Diaoyu conflict carries the added weight of Imperial Japan’s brutal wartime occupation of China. The Diaoyu Islands fell under Japanese control after the First Sino-Japanese War in 1895, when Japan took over Taiwan and its surrounding islands. After World War II the U.S. administered the Diaoyu, returning them to Japanese administration in the 1970s. China argues the islands have long been recognized as its territory. Japan says the Diaoyu were no man’s land before 1895 and should be considered part of Okinawa. As with most disputes over islands in the western Pacific, the potential for undersea oil and gas reserves raises the stakes for all claimants. While the U.S. says it doesn’t take a position on the island’s sovereignty, it says that as they are administered by Japan they fall under the U.S.-Japan Mutual Defense Treaty, meaning the U.S. could be obligated to aid Japan in the event of an attack on them.</p>
              <p>The last time tensions reached this level was in 2010, when Japan’s coast guard <a href="http://www.time.com/time/world/article/0,8599,2020721,00.html"><span style="color: #cc0000;">detained</span></a> a Chinese fishing boat captain who rammed their vessels near the Diaoyu. But recent events have raised the animosity even higher. This spring Tokyo Governor Shintaro Ishihara said that he wanted to purchase four of the islands from the Kurihara family. The family bought the islands in the 1970s from the descendants of a Japanese businessman who ran a fish processing plant there in the early 1900s. Japan’s central government, feeling that it would be less provocative to have the islands in its possession than under the control of the aggressively nationalist Ishihara, bought them instead. But the distinction has made little difference to China. In mid-August a group 14 Chinese activists sailed from Hong Kong and landed on the Diaoyu, where they were detained by Japanese authorities and returned. Days later a group of Japanese nationalists made their own trip to the Diaoyu, which set off protests in several Chinese cities.</p>
              <p>After Japan confirmed it had purchased the islands, China reported a series of Diaoyu baselines—land points from which maritime claims are delineated—to the U.N. That puts China in the position of having to defend those claims. “The baseline announcement implies that China needs to follow it up with actions,” says Stephanie Kleine-Ahlbrandt, the North East Asia director for the International Crisis Group, an ngo that seeks to prevent armed conflict. “The presence of Chinese law enforcement vessels in the area will increase the chances that the Japanese coast guard feels it needs to respond. If there is an incident it will be extremely difficult to walk back given the current state of diplomatic relations, the delicate Chinese transition and the high-pitched nationalist sentiment in China.” That sentiment will only increase in the coming days. September 18 is the 81<sup>st</sup> anniversary of the Mukden Incident, which saw the launch of a broad Japanese invasion of Manchuria. It 2010 the anniversary, coming shortly after the detention of the Chinese fishing boat captain, triggered broad protest in China, and it likely will again this year.</p>

              <p>BEIJING?A Chinese official suggested the country was willing to risk a "minor conflict" over its territorial dispute with Japan, saying it was prepared to chase off Japan Coast Guard vessels from waters around the Senkaku Islands.</p>
              <p>The statement follows an announcement by China's foreign ministry Sept. 14 that it has submitted a sea chart to the United Nations showing the waters as its territorial sea.</p>
              <p>Yu Zhirong, a senior official of the State Oceanic Administration who was formerly with the People’s Liberation Army Navy, told The Asahi Shimbun: "We will have to chase off Japan Coast Guard vessels from Chinese territorial waters. We are not fearful of risking a minor conflict."</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The Chinese government had announced Sept. 10 its intention to turn the waters around the Senkakus, which it calls Diaoyu, into its territorial sea. The foreign ministry said the chart's submission has completed all legal procedures required under the U.N. Convention on the Law of the Sea.</p>

              <p>Perhaps a simple analysis (refer to link above) shows that China bullies Vietnam in 1988 clash at the sea. The Vietnameses has a very weak naval forces at that time and the Chineses forces threw all their large weapons at the Vietnamese troops who was stationed on the waist hight reef.</p>
              <p>I guess China is smart. If the opposing force is much stronger than their's, they would not dare to try something similar to the 1988. Loosing to Jp sure to make them "loose-face".</p>
