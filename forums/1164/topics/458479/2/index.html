              <p>"China will not shy away if Japan chooses to resort to its military. As friction escalates, it is more likely for Japan to retreat in the face of unreliable US security assurances and China's strengthened strategic combat capabilities," it said. <br><br>"For China, triumphing will cement cohesion and public confidence in the country. We cannot back off and we must win." <br><br>The daily said six Chinese surveillance ships carried out a patrol mission in waters around the Diaoyu islands Friday. <br><br>"The move marks China's disdain for Tokyo's so-called 'control' over the islands," it said. <br><br>The disputed islands in the East China Sea, also claimed by Taiwan, lie on a vital shipping route and are surrounded by large hydrocarbon deposits beneath them. <br><br>Japan says it has controlled the islands since 1895 until its surrender at the end of World War II. <br><br><img class="img-bor-inner" style="display: none;" src="http://znn.india.com/spacer.gif" alt="Island row: China announces geographic coordinates"></p>
              <p>The islands were controlled by the US from 1945 to 1972 and subsequently returned to Japan's control. China claims the islands' discovery and control since the 14th century. <br><br>Tokyo says its rivals only became vocal over the issue in the 1970s upon the discovery of valuable minerals. <br><br>The Global Times article said that China's maritime enforcement will serve as a strong deterrent against Japanese rightwing activists who seek to land on the islands. <br><br>"The situation would further change if China seized Japanese nationals who illegally enter China's sovereign waters," it added. <br><br>In a related incident, thousands of protesters rallied at the Japanese embassy in Beijing, RIA Novosti reported. <br><br>A sea of protesters wielding Chinese flags broke through a ring of police officers at the embassy and hurled eggs, plastic bottles and other debris at the building, the report said. <br><br>Protests against Tokyo's move have continued all week at various locations, including at Japanese missions, car dealerships and restaurants.</p>

              <p>There was a clash between China &amp; Vietnamese Naval forces at the Spratley Islands in 1988....http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uy2ZrFphSmc</p>
              <p>Perhaps a simple analysis (refer to link above) shows that China bullies Vietnam in 1988 clash at the sea. The Vietnameses has a very weak naval forces at that time and the Chineses forces threw all their large weapons at the Vietnamese troops who was stationed on the waist hight reef.</p>
              <p>I guess China is smart. If the opposing force is much stronger than their's, they would not dare to try something similar to the 1988. Loosing to Jp sure to make them "loose-face".</p>
              <p>Any body has any historical reference on the China-Vietnam Sea Clash to add? ^o^</p>

              <p>think a war could happen.think oil was said to exist there in diaoyu islands and besides island is part of china from imperial times which meant they were first ones to set foot on uninhabited island and it is nearer to china than japan.<span>After a 1968 study by experts discovered that <strong>oil</strong> reserves might be found under<br>the sea near the <strong>Senkaku/diaoyu Islands</strong>, Japan's ownership of the islands has been <strong>...see wiki</strong></span></p>
              <p> notes on imperial items with a carbon dating could be used to date how old the material was.so if first chinese man set foot there long ago it meant island is china territory as in international laws current.the japs only came in during 1890 or so.</p>

              <p dir="ltr"><em>Xinhua's</em> editorial introduced another element into the dispute between the two  countries. In other boundary disputes pitting China against other Southeast Asian countries, China relies on historic claims to the South China Sea.</p>
              <p dir="ltr">In its relations with Japan, China frequently brings up the topic of Japanese aggression and atrocities in China from the late 19th century Sino-Japanese war continuing throughout World War II. The dispute with Japan is now part of the legacy of World War II and China claims that under the Potsdam Declaration of 1945, Japan was obligated <span id="IL_AD1" class="IL_AD"><span style="color: #0000cc;">to return</span></span> all the territories seized illegally.</p>

Local people were forced to pay tribute at Qing posts, and Qing officials granted some titles to local elders and entrusted them with the task of "keeping the peace". By the mid-18th century, Qing officials had registered 56 surname groups; of these, Qing sources note that six clans and 148 households were those of Ainu and Nivkh who came under the Qing administrative umbrella on Sakhalin.<sup id="cite_ref-6" class="reference"><a href="http://sgforums.com/forums/1164/topics/#cite_note-6"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0066cc;"><span>[</span>7<span>]</span></span></span></a></sup> However, as the Chinese governments did not have a military presence on the island, people from Japan attempted to colonise the island.</p>

              <p>The Jesuits, however, did not have a chance to visit the island personally, and the inadequate information about its geography provided by the <em>Ke tcheng</em> people and the Manchus who had been to the island would not allow them to identify it with the land visited by de Vries in 1643. As a result, many 17th century maps showed a rather strangely shaped Sakhalin, which included only the northern half of the island (with Cape Patience), while Cape Aniva discovered by de Vries and the "Black Cape" (<a title="Cape Crillon" href="http://sgforums.com/wiki/Cape_Crillon"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0066cc;">Cape Crillon</span></span></a>) were thought to be part of the mainland.</p>

              <p>According to China, Chinese historical records detailing the discovery and geographical feature of these islands date back to the year 1403. For several centuries they have been administered as part of Taiwan and have always been used exclusively by Chinese fishermen as an operational base. In 1874, Japan took Liu Chiu Islands from China by force. Diaoyutai, however, remained under the administration Taiwan, a part of China. Taiwan (including Diaoyutai) was ceded to Japan in 1895 after the first Sino-Japanese War. Originally, during the Japanese occupation of Taiwan, the Diaoyutai Archipelago came under the jurisdiction of Taipei Prefecture. After the close of the Second World War, when U.S. troops were stationed on the Ryukyu and Diaoyutai Archipelagoes, the KMT government which had received Taiwan did not immediately demand that that the US give them sovereignty. Diaoyutai was returned to China at the end of World War II in 1945 based upon the 1943 agreement of the Big Three in Cairo. Diaoyutai was part of Taiwan hence was included in that package.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>In 1969, a report by the UN Economic Commission for Asia and the Far East (ECAFE) indicated the possibility of large reserves of oil in the vicinity of the Diaoyutai Archipelago. This report set off a political dispute between Taiwan, China and Japan which has been going on now for over thirty years.</p>
              <p>According to the UN Convention on the Law of the Sea the stipulation, should act according to the fair principle development negotiations, seeks means which both sides both can accept. When there is disagreement on the demarcation of EEZs between any countries, the law stipulates that the parties concerned should avoid anything that could undermine an eventual agreement. China's gas field drilling near the median line between the two countries is regarded by Japan as an obvious infringement of the spirit of this law. Tokyo's proposal, which has not been accepted by Beijing, has been to divide the sea equally between the two countries, which would put China's Chunxiao claim only three miles from Japanese territory. China's offers to jointly develop the oil field have been rebuffed.</p>
              <p>The specific development in dispute is China's drilling in the Chunxiao field, which is three miles west of the median line, but which Japan contends may be tapping natural gas reserves which extend past the median line. The Chunxiao gas field in Xihu Sag in the East China Sea is estimated to hold reserves of more than 1.6 tcf of natural gas and is expected to become a major producer in the next ten years. Commercial operation was expected to begin in mid-2005 at a production rate of 70 bcf per year, rising to 282 bcf by 2010. Sinopec Star has reserves of 7 tcf of gas, 1.9 tcf of which is held in the Chunxiao area. China has proven reserves of natural gas of about 53.3 trillion cubic feet (tcf). Most of China's gas fields are in the the western and north-central parts of the country, though offshore basins are becoming increasingly important.</p>

On the morning of Sept. 12, organizations for unification, including the Labor Party of Taiwan, Alliance for the Reunification of China and the Cross-Strait Peaceful Development Forum, sent delegations to the Japan Communication Association in Taipei to protest Japan's action of “buying the Islands.” The organizers of the activity said that both sides of the strait will jointly defend the Diaoyu Islands and they hope the two sides will defend the sovereignty of China hand in hand.<br><br>In a “Cross-Strait Dialogue,” it was implied for the first time that the two sides should join hands to deal with Japan because it accords with the common expectations of the Chinese people on both sides of the strait. If it is feasible, it will without doubt be a great breakthrough in the political contact between the two sides. <br></span></p>

              <p><br>its ok,the oil on island is like a trillion dollars$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$.it will pay for the wars and interests and even extra plates of deuck rice for everyone in china.think  there is a time limit here to claim back island or else it goes to japan before the claim date.its lost and found.china lost it as it was theirs from ming dynasty.japan found it only like receently and doesnt want to return it according to the laws made in past when it confiscated the lands in sino japanese wars.this is how sincere japan is to china regarding the massacre of 1000000 men and woman in ww2 and the invasion of china.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>by right the island belongs to taiwan as it was administered to them but they are too weak to fight the japanese army now.so china will do the fighting if it starts and wins.</p>
              <p>what will the fight be?destroyers,aircraft  carriers and troop carriers landing on island to occupy it.</p>
              <p>singapore will be involved if usa comes into the war to ally the japanese.mainly as a interpreter for the  china chinese and good relations with usa all along.spore is currently the only neutral to usa and china.</p>
              <p>president obama seems to be picking on china and now critisces it over the trade issues.</p>

              <div id="article-body-blocks">
              <p>Japanese companies have temporarily closed factories and offices in <a title="More from guardian.co.uk on China" href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/china"><span style="color: #005689;">China</span></a> after a weekend of violent protests sparked by the countries' <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2012/sep/14/china-japan-senkaku-diaoyu-islands"><span style="color: #005689;">competing claims </span></a>to a group of islands in the East China Sea, as the US warned of a danger of armed conflict and urged both sides to exercise restraint.</p>
              <p>The closures came after people took to the streets in more than 70 Chinese cities to protest the <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2012/sep/11/china-warns-japan-disputed-islands"><span style="color: #005689;">Japanese government's purchase</span></a> last week of the <a title="More from guardian.co.uk on Senkaku Islands" href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/senkaku-islands"><span style="color: #005689;">Senkaku islands</span></a>, known as the Diaoyu in China, from their private Japanese owners.</p>
              <p>China reacted by sending marine patrol ships to Japanese-claimed waters around the islands. On Monday, the Kyodo news agency, citing the online edition of the Central People's Broadcasting Station in China, said that as many as 1,000 Chinese fishing boats had set sail on Sunday and would arrive in waters off the Senkakus later in the day.</p>
              <p>The diplomatic row has spilled over into the countries' close economic ties, amid warnings by the US secretary of defence, Leon Panetta, that the spat could deteriorate into armed conflict.</p>
              <p>"Obviously we're concerned by the demonstrations and we're concerned by the conflict that is taking place over the Senkaku islands, and the message that I have tried to convey is a message that we have to urge calm and restraint on all sides," he told reporters before leaving Tokyo for Beijing earlier on Monday.</p>
              <p>While it sanctioned the demonstrations, the Chinese government on Monday attempted to dampen anti-Japanese sentiment, removing provocative online comments and photographs of the protests, and threatening to arrest anyone found to have broken the law.</p>
              <span class="inline wide"><img src="http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/maps_and_graphs/2012/9/16/1347795937866/Senkaku-Diaoyu-Islands-001.png" alt="Senkaku-Diaoyu Islands" width="460" height="276"> <span class="caption" style="width: 460px;">Location of the Senkaku/Diaoyu islands. </span></span>
              <p>Chinese authorities said 10 people had been arrested for attacking cars or vandalising shops, while arrests were also reported over an arson attack on a Japanese electronics factory and car dealership.</p>
              <p>In some of the worst of the weekend's protests, demonstrators hurled bottles and other items at the Japanese embassy in Beijing and attacked Japanese restaurants and other businesses in at least five cities.</p>
              <p>Toyota and Honda said arsonists had badly damaged their dealerships in Qingdao in eastern China, while Panasonic said one of its plants had been set alight. The electronics giant said the factory would remain closed through Tuesday, when China marks the anniversary of the start of <a title="More from guardian.co.uk on Japan" href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/japan"><span style="color: #005689;">Japan</span></a>'s occupation of parts of the country.</p>
              <p>Canon said it would also close three of its four factories in China for the next two days, while All Nippon Airways reported a spike in cancellations on flights from China to Japan.</p>
              <p>Meanwhile, Japan's Fast Retailing said would close 19 of its Uniqlo clothing stores in China on Tuesday as it expects the anti-Japan demonstrations to escalate. Asia's largest apparel retailer shut seven stores on Monday.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>In the southern city of Shenzhen, police fired teargas and turned water cannon and pepper spray on thousands of protesters attempting to occupy a street.</p>
              <p>On Sunday, Panetta said he was concerned that other countries, including the US, could be dragged into any conflict over the islands.</p>
              <p>Washington has declined to take sides in the Senkaku row, but acknowledges that under the US-Japan security treaty it is required to come to its ally's aid if it is attacked.</p>
              <p>Japan's foreign minister, Koichiro Gemba, who met Panetta in Tokyo on Monday, said it was "mutually understood between Japan and the United States that (the Senkakus) are covered by the treaty".</p>
              <p>Panetta said the US did not take a position on the sovereignty claims, but added, "Having said that, we expect that these issues will be resolved peacefully and although we understand the differences here with regard to jurisdiction, it is extremely important that diplomatic means on both sides be used to try to constructively resolve these issues.</p>
              <p>"It is in everybody's interest for Japan and China to maintain good relations and to find a way to avoid further escalation."</p>
              <p>The Japanese prime minister, Yoshihiko Noda, called on the Chinese authorities to ensure the safety of Japanese citizens and businesses. "Regrettably, this is a problem concerning the safety of Japanese nationals and Japan-affiliated companies," he told broadcaster NHK. "I would like to urge the Chinese government to protect their safety."</p>
              <p>China described Japan's decision to buy three of the uninhabited islets, which are thought to be surrounded by <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2012/apr/19/tokyo-governor-senkaku-islands-china"><span style="color: #005689;">huge deposits of natural gas</span></a>, as a violation of its sovereignty.</p>
              <p>Japan says the islands have been an integral part of its territory since the late 19th century, claiming that China had only shown an interest in them after studies pointed to the presence of potentially valuable natural resources nearby.</p>
              <p>Chinese state media and online activists united in calling for a boycott of Japanese goods, while Chinese tourism authorities ordered travel agents to cancel package tours to Japan during a week-long national holiday next month.</p>
              <p>One newspaper warned Japan that it could face another "lost decade" of economic stagnation if trade ties are affected. China replaced Japan as the world's second-biggest economy in 2010, but analysts said that both sides would suffer from a prolonged trade spat.</p>
              <p>China is Japan's single biggest trading partner and bilateral trade was worth a record $345bn (£213bn) last year.</p>
              <p>"How could it be that Japan wants another lost decade, and could even be prepared to go back by two decades," said a front-page editorial in the overseas edition of the People's Daily, a Communist party newspaper.</p>
              <p>The paper said China had always exercised caution over "playing the economic card", adding "but in struggles concerning territorial sovereignty, if Japan continues its provocations, then China will take up the battle".</p>
              <p>Other recent outbreaks of anti-Japanese sentiment, in 2005 and 2010, ended with short-lived protests and minor disruption to trade</p>

              <p>alll shipping in and out of japan korea china and taiwan will be significantly reduced as ships would be blown up upon entering region.that would increase fear factor of submarines torpedoing any trade vessels,oil vesssels,cargo vessels etc as a fear factor to cripple each others economy.</p>
              <p>the bets are high......around a trillion dollars.only when war losses reach that mark it would be deemed economically unfesible to have a war.that would be a few years n  thousands of deaths.</p>

              <p><br> its ok,the oil on island is like a trillion
              dollars$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$.it will pay for the wars and
              interests and even extra plates of deuck rice for everyone in
              china.think  there is a time limit here to claim back island
              or else it goes to japan before the claim date.its lost and
              found.china lost it as it was theirs from ming dynasty.japan found
              it only like receently and doesnt want to return it according to
              the laws made in past when it confiscated the lands in sino
              japanese wars.this is how sincere japan is to china regarding the
              massacre of 1000000 men and woman in ww2 and the invasion of
              china.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>by right the island belongs to taiwan as it was administered to
              them but they are too weak to fight the japanese army now.so china
              will do the fighting if it starts and wins.</p>
              <p>what will the fight be?destroyers,aircraft  carriers and
              troop carriers landing on island to occupy it.</p>
              <p>singapore will be involved if usa comes into the war to ally the
              japanese.mainly as a interpreter for the  china chinese and
              good relations with usa all along.spore is currently the only
              neutral to usa and china.</p>
              <p>president obama seems to be picking on china and now critisces
              it over the trade issues.</p>

              <p>who says there is any oil on the island, or below it?</p>
              <p>Japan occupied it as their conquest of China to expand the Japanese empire.</p>
              <p>The american occupied the island as part of their war against imperial japan, and administered the island from 1945 until 1972 as part of the Ryukyu islands. They revert these islands to the control of Japan because China was under communist. Neither China nor Taiwan was part of the treaty in this handover, and the earlier treaty in Cairo in 1943, which was subsequently reaffirmed by the allied and the soviet in Potsdam, were totally ignored.</p>
              <p>The dispute has everything to do with the sovereignty of the nations, looking back in the history. Little to do with politics or ideology, because the commie in china and the nationalist in taiwan are on the same side.</p>
              <p>Until there is confirmation that there is oil, the economic value of this place is just the fishes around, and the control of sea lane, which has great strategic significance. and if there is oil, then the situation gets more complicated.</p>
