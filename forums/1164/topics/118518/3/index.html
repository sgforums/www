            <div class='col-md body'>Well, I'm amazed at the number of folks on this thread that seem to dislike, discount or simply write off the venerable M-16.

But what is it about the M-16 that commands this dissing?<br><br>Well, I know a bunch of folks who don't care for the 5.56mm but would like to keep the basic M4 design and function, so out comes new calibers like the 6.8mm for the SOCOM guys BUT the Barrett they shoot is built on the same M4 platform.<br><br>What about accuracy? I heard some folks complain that the M16 is inaccurate. Have you seen a match at Camp Perry's? You will be shocked by the number of full size accurized M16s that show up year after year. I don't see any AUGs.<br><br>Next, 3-gun matches where you show up competing with a pistol, a shotgun and a rifle. Some of the top shooters in this field including Taran Butler and Mike Voight (president of USPSA) run an M-16 variant from JP Enterprises.<br><br>No disrespect guys but the problem here is that many of us have only handled what we were/are issued during NS and have not much actual experience running some of the carbines side by side.

(This is not to say a short paratroop FAL doesn't exist.)<br><br>No, in Singapore we never had either the M16A1 nor the M16A2. We in Singapore are issued with the M16S1 (M16A1 equivalent) and this is the one and only M16 rifle licensed to be made in Singapore. SAF does issue M16 carbines (Israeli version - mostly made by Colt USA) to tankees and recce troops. I have also come across  imported Colt USA-made M16 without the bolt-assist but these are very rare.<br><br>And not everyone has dissed the M16. I love the M16. But that's because I've fired, trained, slept, ate meals, laughed and at times, nearly passed out with the M16. I can understand why a lot of people here love the new SAR-21 compared to a 30-year old design. Furthermore, there is also an element of nationalistic pride.<br><br>I don't like the idea of bullpup, being an old soldier. But that's just me.</div>

In those days, the planes had to stop at Dubai before flying on to London. As we queued up to re-board our plane to London, guards all armed with folding stock AK-47s picked out all the American passport holders and frisked them spread-eagle in front of all the other passengers.

Then again, its a matter of personal preference.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br><br>The SAF carbine that's issued is quite reliable. But of cos', over the years of wear and tear, it is understandable why some of us are unhappy with it. I was reissued with a spanking new carbine after my last one failed the 'barrel test.' Found out from the armourer that the barrel has worn to the point that its wider than 5.56.<br><br>When I first fired my new carbine on the range, it was a beauty...the loud crack (as compared to the M-16's 'pop'), and its shorter barrel actually made it easier for me to control my shots. I even collapsed the folding stock, and the result is a very handy weapon that can be very accurate up to 200 metres. It doesn't IA as much as my friends in the infantry companies using M-16, and I suspect that because of the shorter barrel, the gas tube is shorter, and hence, the shorter distance it has to travel to push back the bolt. In subsequent training exercises, I've never had a problem with my carbine, even with blanks. The best part is...I only have to clean it using 4 pieces of a 5 piece rod!! lol  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br><br>Like what alot of us agree, its a matter of getting used to I guess...but given a choice between my carbine and the SAR-21, I'd still take my carbine, but slap on an Avimo scope...<img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br></div>

Mr. Green</blockquote>Roger that, Tango. I hear you about the M4s. It would be nice if you guys are given the choice of personal upgrades to fit your needs. That's the one good thing about being in the US military. You are issued the standards but if you wanna upgrade or add-on, you can do so at your leisure (and your own expense). Weapon changes, however, require permission. I know a bunch of Marines who brought their Glocks (aka Combat Tupperware) over with them instead of their issued Berettas (they call them Barfettas).</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I never paid much attention to the SAR-21 but after you guys started this thread, I decided to do some research on it. I still wouldn't get a chance to try one out but the word on the Net (it would appear) is in good favour of the SAR-21. I've read some very positive reviews of it <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>That said, there is something about the design of a bullpup that I find difficult to deal with and my pet peeve is reloading. Some of you guys might find this rather funny but one of the best ways to make any decision on weapon choices is to watch the competition pros run their rifles. One stands to pick up on many ideas and most of these ideas flow back into the units and eventually into the war fronts.<br><br>Keeping your rifle running is an example. I know this is hard for some of us to picture due to the non-issue of sidearms (other than the SOF and such) in the SAF but when you watch dynamic pistol matches, you will notice that the basic reloading technique is all the same, pull pistol in, tilt, retrieve fresh mag from pouch (on the waist) while releasing the empty one. Fastest way from A to B is a straight line so the angle of tilt is such that the mag well points directly in the direction where the new mag is being retrieved. In it goes, release slide lock with support hand and back to the business at hand.<br><br>The same goes for most rifle shooters except that (depending on LE or military), our pouches / mag holders are either (still) on the waist or on a thigh rig. With the basic M16 platform and such, the reloading technique is the still the same. The idea is for you to keep drawing your fresh mags from around the same area. Of course, there are several aftermarket accessories that can help quicken the first mag changes like the Mag Cinch, the Red-Mag, etc but once that is depleted, it's back to retrieving again.<br><br>Some folks call it muscle memory (there is no such thing as muscle memory; just a phrase) and I have seen it time and time again when some uniform guys show up at our range for a tactical 3-gun match wearing a vest that holds all their mags. When it comes time to reload, a bunch of them find their support hands going down to their waist or thighs instead of their vest and realized their mistake a second or two later.<br><br>This old / standard / whatever-you-wanna-call-it syle of reloading is pretty much ingrained among shooters and operators stateside and it works better on the current rifles then the bullpup designs.  Change the rifle design and with it comes re-training.<br><br>Just my 2 cents guys.</div>
