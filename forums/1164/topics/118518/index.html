Has laser aiming device for close combat, 1.5 optical scope.<br><br>d) SAR21 was not designed for left handed/shoulder use, and the fire selector is badly located. Standard version has no rails for additional optical night sights.<br><br>e) I guess it would be an advantage to have a locally produced rifle to replace the M16.<br><br>f) Internationally - the HK G36 series appears to be a very good and popular alternative these days. The other alternative is the Canadian version of the M16.<br><br>g) The M16 has been around for 30 years. There are fathers who had used the M16 rifle in the 1970s' during NS, and now they have sons using the same M16s. We should be moving on to a newer updated rifle.<br><br></div>

I hate to have one such "means" taken away by some silly designer at ST Kinetics or admin general at MINDEF.<br><br>During early stage of the recent Iraq war, a British Scots unit was ambushed and outnumbered.

The fearless Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders stormed rebel positions after being ambushed and pinned down.   Despite being outnumbered five to one, they suffered only three minor wounds in the hand-to-hand fighting near the city of Amara.  The battle erupted after Land Rovers carrying 20 Argylls came under attack on a highway.<br><br>After radioing for back-up, they fixed bayonets and charged at 100 rebels using tactics learned in drills.<br><br>When the fighting ended bodies lay all over the highway Â— and more were floating in a nearby river. Nine rebels were captured. An Army spokesman said: Â“This was an intense engagement.Â”<br><br>The last bayonet charge was by the Scots Guards and the Paras against Argentinian positions. <strong></strong><strong></strong><strong></strong><strong>[b]</strong></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>This debate should be of concern to hardcore devoted soldiers keen on their profession<br><br>But as for a normal reservist like me who have finished seving the nation, it doesnt matter.But i prefer SAR 21.Why? cause it doesnt have rough, sharp edges like the ol fashioned M16 during my BMT days, only i knew how many    times i had skin abrasions on my hands handling the M16 and cocking it.It was so distracting. I think Sar 21's plastic and rounded edges feel is more user friendly,comfortable and smooth to handle and also gives a novely feeling of being new and up to date...Wish i may not want to handle the M16 again when i go for my reservist</div>

The Sun is not the most sensational tabloid but it sure tries to be. But what you say is true. When it goes hand to hand, I rather have a fixed bayonet than trying to rifle butt someone senseless.<br><br><blockquote>Originally posted by tvdog:<br><strong>All bullpups have mag release behind, which I feel is a serious flaw.<br><br>I'm sure you can imagine a tight situation where you need to change mag quickly like in FIBUA or FOFO where having a magazine behind is gonna be a problem.<br><br>Does anyone have any opinion about the lack of a bayonet fixture? Not that I look forward to a hand to hand fight but it would be quite sad not to have a bayonet if the situation calls for one.<br><br>The point is that every so-called "modern" war eventually boils down to one human being killing another with whatever means available. I hate to have one such "means" taken away by some silly designer at ST Kinetics or admin general at MINDEF.<br><br>During early stage of the recent Iraq war, a British Scots unit was ambushed and outnumbered. The small unit a bayonet charge. Not only were the Iraqis so shocked they ran, the Brits managed to stab about 30 of them to death.<br><br>A lot of news about this but this one is most to the point:<br><br>[b]Bayonet Brits kill 35 rebels<br>From an article in The Sun</strong><br><br>British soldiers killed 35 Iraqi attackers in the ArmyÂ’s first bayonet charge since the Falklands War 22 years ago.  The fearless Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders stormed rebel positions after being ambushed and pinned down.   Despite being outnumbered five to one, they suffered only three minor wounds in the hand-to-hand fighting near the city of Amara.  The battle erupted after Land Rovers carrying 20 Argylls came under attack on a highway.<br><br>After radioing for back-up, they fixed bayonets and charged at 100 rebels using tactics learned in drills.<br><br>When the fighting ended bodies lay all over the highway Â— and more were floating in a nearby river. Nine rebels were captured. An Army spokesman said: Â“This was an intense engagement.Â”<br><br>The last bayonet charge was by the Scots Guards and the Paras against Argentinian positions. <strong></strong><strong></strong><strong></strong><strong>[b]</strong>[/b]</blockquote> <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"></div>
