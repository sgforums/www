            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote>Please don't give any wild visions to the S'pore soldiers that the American military is made up of cowboys who disobey standing orders to carry their own personal side arms. The MARINEs that brought their own Glocks had the permission from their CO when a study by a MARINE Lt found that the M9 was not suitable for MARINEs fighting in Iraq.<br>Its good you've highlighted that changes to U.S military issued weapons requires permission. Of course, this ruling does not enforce on Green Berets, D-boys &amp; SEALs as they've valid reasons for mutating their weapons.</blockquote>John, like I mentioned, permission is required to do so. And if you DO get permission and bring your own, chances of you bringing them back is close to zero. The Glocks get sold to other incoming grunts.<br><br>Some may think of them as Cowboys but I don't and that is not the impression I hope to portray of them. If I did then I apologize becos' that was never my intention. The Marines have my absolute respect and I personally hold them higher on the mantel that any other units out there.<br><br>My knowledge of this is personal from the point of view that I was there when some who re-enlisted (my close friends) purchased Glocks after they were told that they could bring their own. I spent at least one day a week at Quantico (the base) and at Quantico Arms (the base store) shooting the breeze with these guys. Before they re-enlisted I hosted classes for them with former Marine spec ops guys like Patrick Goodale so that they stay efficient with their new Glocks and such.<br><br>As for the SOCOM guys, well, like you said, they have their own reasons <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br><br><blockquote>The rifle without the forward assist is known here still as the AR-15.My unit has loads of these.Sadly speaking, the usage of Picatinny rails in the SAF is way below the rate in the US Army, where I suppose practically every M16 or Colt/Knight Armament derivative has it attached.<br><br>Oh well, you would have made a very good Armament Specialist.But then again, being Stateside beats serving in the SAF.</blockquote>Lazer, I'm a far cry from being a Specialist of that sort. I learn as much as I can on the field, range and matches more than what I read from gun rags. I have so much of it laying around but I can't find the time to read 'em all. On average, I shoot every other day and dry fire almost every evening.  30,000 pistol rounds a year is about average and I still lack behind some of my guys who shoot upwards of 45,000. That doesn't include the 5.56 ammo and the shotgun (my personal favourite) slugs and buckshots. I take every opportunity  I get to stop and ask the guys I meet about the stuff that they run and gun with.<br><br>Not everything you see needs to be fancy. For example, fighting at night is a doctrine we take seriously and I'm sure you guys do the same and as such, a light on your rifle is an important consideration. For the AR15 you have, you do not need a mount of any sort. All you need is to purchased some velcro. Apply enough velcro loop to cover half the diameter of your light and and a longer length of the hoop side to wrap around both the light and your handguard.<br><br>Even simpler ( what I originally did with my shotgun).....ducktape the damn light. Slightly fancier, use 1" or 1.5" nylon webbing, fastex buckles and velcro. Easy on, easy off, requires no mods to the rifle and doesn't damage the handguard too. I have cut and sewn dozens of slings and such from the Beretta Store to the M4 and find a lot of easy ways to get certain things done.<br><br>Anyway, I hope to put all this knowledge to some good use back in Singapore sometime soon. First the GSA expo at the end of this month and then we'll work on getting an office up and running.<br><br>Please feel to email me should you need any other such ideas. I'll be more than happy to help.<br><br><blockquote>6.8 was design with the current issued M4 rifling in mind &amp; not vis versa, so I don't think the SAR-21 rifling would've any problem as long as they continue to used only ammos certified by NATO.<div>code:<pre><br><br>Thanks, John <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"></pre></div></blockquote></div>

However, negative events still outweight the rest.  Folks back home told me that there are still anti-war groups using the negative events as a political cause to get Mr Rumfield out of office.  Their views is that if they can get him out of office, then they'll be able to get Bush out of office before his 2nd term is up.  However, these groups fail to recognise the chaos that would follow if they do succeed.

Number of jams etc.<br><br>Expensive but this will impress the locals giving them confidence in the rifle and impress potential foreign buyers. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br><br>But if it doesn't fair well in the test... well you can guess the out come.

The M240 is a excellent Belgian-made GPMG known elsewhere and in Singapore as the FN MAG. The M240 is a conversion of the FN MAG to US-specs. The M60 was, is and remains a piece of crap.

Sure I am very proud of the fact that we make some really spiffy weapons but selling them to countries like with horrible, horrible human rights abuses records like Burma, Indonesia, Cambodia and certain East European countries - um... that really sucks.<br><br>We've shipped entire arms factories to Burma. I have a picture of a Croatian National Guardsman with an Ultimax. We also sold Ultimax to Indonesia and Philippines. We sold SAR-80, I think to Bosnia. I can't verify this but someone once told me that we are one of the big landmines exporter in the world. A lot of these countries regularly turn these weapons onto civilian popupation, and you know landmines continue to kill and maim indiscriminately years after the war is over. Even though Singaporeans don't go to war and shoot people but we are equally guilty cos our country supplies arms so others can do the killing. Should Singapore continue to export arms - and keep it a secret from Singaporeans?

For how long did they test it and what were the tests exactly? WHERE did you get the impression I am condemning the SAR-21? The world isn't Black or White. I don't HATE or LOVE the SAR-21, but I definitely think the engineers missed out on a few important things.<br><br>In fact, I said in my last post that the fact that the SAF adopted the SAR-21 after rejecting the SAR-80 and SR-88 is testimony to the quality of the SAR-21. It is also testimony to the fact that SAF LISTENS to its soldiers who field tests the weapons. I know because a friend of mine was INVOLVED in the SAR-80 trials back in the 80's.

It was part of a longer-range effort to perfect an over-and-under style weapon, known as the Objective Individual Combat Weapon or XM-29, developed by Alliant Techsystems and Heckler &amp; Koch.<br><br>The XM-29 fires special air-bursting projectiles and standard 5.56mm ammunition. But at 18 pounds, itÂ’s still too heavy to meet requirements, so Army planners decided to perfect each of XM-29Â’s components separately, allowing soldiers to take advantage of new technology sooner.<br><br>The XM-8 is one of those components. It features a compact model for close quarters, a standard carbine and a designated marksman/squad automatic rifle model with a longer, heavier barrel and bipod legs for stability.<br><br>The March 4 Â“Pre-solicitation Notice for the Objective Individual Combat Weapon Increment I family of weapons,Â” invites small-arms makers to try and meet an Army requirement for a Â“non developmental family of weapons that are capable of firing U.S. standard M855 and M856Â” 5.56mm ammunition.<br><br>The family would consist of carbine, compact, designated marksman and light machinegun models.<br><br>A formal Request for Proposal is slated to be issued Â“on or aboutÂ” March 23, the notice states.<br><br>The OICW Increment I is intended to replace current weapon systems, including the M-4, M-16, M-249 squad automatic weapon and selected M-9 pistols for the active Army, the notice states.<br><br>Interested companies will be required to submit four of each type of the four different variants by late spring.<br><br>Submissions will be put through a series of tests, including live-fire exercises, to see if they meet the requirement.<br><br>The winning company will be awarded a low-rate initial production contract to produce up to 4,900 weapons systems and could receive a full-rate production contract to make more than 134,000 weapons systems, the notice states.</div>

I did not know that SAF officers were issued with sidearms. Like I said, please excuse the ignorance but when did this happen? I was hoping it would eventually happen but as I've said before, I've been out of touch with what's going on in the SAF for quite some time now.<br><br>I'm glad to hear it is/was the P229.  The current DAK model is often requested from the DHS to the Coast Guards. Only thing I would change in it would be the slide stop. 'Hell &amp; Back Reliability'....I have to agree.<br><br>Full Discloure: Yes, some folks at SIGARMS are my friends.

Sure I am very proud of the fact that we make some really spiffy weapons but selling them to countries like with horrible, horrible human rights abuses records like Burma, Indonesia, Cambodia and certain East European countries - um... that really sucks.<br><br>Should Singapore continue to export arms - and keep it a secret from Singaporeans? The answer is a firm "NO".<br><br>There are other ways to make money.<br><br>What did I say about the SAR-21 that sounded like condemnation to you? I pointed out its shortcomings. I did not say it was a piece of crap. I did not say that it cannot be depended upon.<br><br>I didn't say that the SAR-21 is unproven. I said the magazine writers didn't field test the weapons themselves and mostly wrote what's printed on the sales brochure. Where did Jane's test the weapon? For how long did they test it and what were the tests exactly? WHERE did you get the impression I am condemning the SAR-21? The world isn't Black or White. I don't HATE or LOVE the SAR-21, but I definitely think the engineers missed out on a few important things.<br><br>In fact, I said in my last post that the fact that the SAF adopted the SAR-21 after rejecting the SAR-80 and SR-88 is testimony to the quality of the SAR-21. It is also testimony to the fact that SAF LISTENS to its soldiers who field tests the weapons. I know because a friend of mine was INVOLVED in the SAR-80 trials back in the 80's. The heavy weight was the main complaint.<br><br>Um... Of course you can fight with a bayonet in your hand. I can stab someone in the eye with a toothpick given the opportunity... but what's your point? Why can't we have a bayonet lug on the SAR-21? Why can't I make strong protest so that the people at ST will put a bayonet lug back onto the SAR-21? Will a bayonet lug affect the performance of the SAR-21? Why are you so adamant that we should not criticise a product so that it becomes better?<br></div></blockquote>Hahaha! With regards to the M60 &amp; M240, you've got me on that one.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_redface.gif" alt="Embarassed" title="Embarassed"><br>My grand pappy used to said it takes a fool not to recognise his mistakes before hand.  Guess I'm the fool for just typing without checking.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_redface.gif" alt="Embarassed" title="Embarassed"><br>Yes, I've fired off the FN MAG too while I was with the Union Jake army for awhile.  Have you fired any models of M60s?<br><br>Good for you to have served 10 years of infantry duties, I've extra years to my credit with the U.S military.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br><br>Hey, in case you've forgotten, Singapore was also link to the sale of nuclear making parts to Iraq in the recent U.N reports.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br>Anyway, as long as there is money to be made, weapons would be sold to anyone willing to pay.  And should it be a secret? Yes, from any government stand point of view.  Its the same in the U.S except that we've got the Freedom of Speech, so there'll be people who would become,"DEEP-THROAT".  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br>And the fact that in U.S, the weapons company rarely inform the government as to who they are selling their arms or tech to.  So sometimes the government are in the dark as to how their arms are in the hands of the other.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_neutral.gif" alt="Neutral" title="Neutral"><br><br>True, there are other alternative to making money but you'll have to be in the arms industry to know why they would sell their arms to other unwelcome parties.  I'm sure you've heard of arms shows almost every year, at these shows you can actually pick any weapon up on the spot if you pay by cash.  You get a discount if you buy more then 5 crates of the weapon from 1 company, no questions asked.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br><br>Well, everything you've said about the SAR 21 sounds as good as condamning it.  No, I did not claim that you said the weapon is a "piece of crap" nor did I claim that you said it "cannot be depended upon".<br><br>I'm not sure how you concluded that most mag writers don't test fire the weapon that they report on but thats ok.  Anyway, I know for certain that the writers for Jane's mag did indeed get at least a prototype version of any weapon in the market &amp; run it to their own sets of test.  Otherwise, you can always file a law suit against them for publishing unsubstantiated reports on the product in question.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br><br>Well, if you've stated the way you're now stating about the SAR 21, we wouldn't be talking about it now would we?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br><br>Are you really sure that you can stab someone in the eye with a tooth pick?  Most of the fights I've been involved in, my targets don't usually stand around to be stab unless from behind which requires alot of stalking skills.  But anyway, of course you're entitled to make your protest all you want to ST( whats it stand for? ) but did you protest it to them or hoping that they'll be reading it from this forum?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br><br>Ok, I guess I do sound a bit overly harsh about defending this weapon.  But like I've stated earlier, I'm surprised at how fast Singaporeans are at criticising their own made products.  And the fact that the criticism comes with no solutions is as good as all talk &amp; not action.  If you really think you've got an ideal or suggestion on how the weapon should be best for the infantryman then write a letter or a proposal to ST.  Who knows, they just might even pay you for your ideal.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"></div>
