Aims accurately well.<br><br>b) What do you dislike about the M-16?<br>ANS: But like it is in Vietnam War, it crop ups when you really need it to work. Its long in length, not suitable for Asians and not good for chiong swah.<br><br>c) What do you like about the SAR-21?<br>ANS: Its shorter. Better to chiong swah by length. Quite stable. The laser is good bah.<br><br>d) What do you dislike about the SAR-21?<br>ANS: Perhaps I'm to used to M-16. Not quite use to the way SAR 21 works.<br>A bit bulky and heavier. Which is bad for chiong swah. Some stuff is still a bit fragile. Bad for chiong swah. Scope is a luxurious defect. Wat happen if mud got into the scope.

However, at least its there in the 1st place.<br>Its really not advisable to use the M16 to whack anyone unless you're sure that you do not need the weapon later on.  Unlike the AKs, M16 fibre butt isn't able to handle impact as claimed by its designers.<br>If you're referring to the older models of the M16s, they're indeed fragile.  Weak barrel heats up easily resulting in barrel explosin, shakable parts causing line of sight to be shifter when firing in burst, unable to withstand sudden hard impact, almost useless after going through mud, sand or rivers, etc.<br>The good thing about its length is that it can be used like a bolt action rifle for single distance shot.  As for comfort?  I prefer using a G36, its bulky &amp; not light.  But at least it gets the job done &amp; gives me a better chance of survivability in any enviroment.<br><br>Todays war field is no longer measured in distance of exceeding more then 150 yards.  As seen in current wars after Vietnam, most military fights occur in tight close civilian areas.  MP5s would be an ideal weapon but its 9mm rounds are not suitable for killing.  H&amp;K did produced MP5s that chamber .45s but being a bigger round means lesser amount of arounds it can carry.  U.S military therefore stuck to using back M16 model design but modifying it to suit new combat fighting grounds.  However, they've foreseen that there's a need for a bullpup assault rifle for the U.S military in the near future &amp; have started testing a number of XMs, XM8 being the current winner.</div>

Soon, we'l have a generation of soldiers who wouldn't know what an M16 is much less train with both weapons.<br><br>I have never even held a SAR-21 but I have examined a Steyr AUG before. I found that magazine changing to be awkward and slow even under relaxed circumstances. And it is not just a matter of training. No matter how well-trained you are it is still going to be slow to reach behind the pistol grip to change magazines.</div>

He was more talking about the Steyr in particular and not bullpups in general. In conclusion he said that he will trust his life on the Steyr AUG.<br><br>Actually, the Steyr is in many ways still a very revolutionary design 20 years later. It still looks very futuristic. But the most revolutionary feature is the fact that there isn't a selector switch. You simply squeeze less hard for single shot, harder for bursts and squeeze all the way on the trigger for full-auto.<br><br>Maybe that's why SAF didn't adopt this weapon. Otherwise you'll have hokkien peng going full-auto all over the range.</div></blockquote>Yes, XM8 is not a bullpup.  It beat the other XMs, which included bullpup designs,  to win the contract.  But it does not mean that the U.S military has given up on bullpup design, its just that they'ven't come across a design that they like.<br><br>So you've finally read P.K's article.  Yes, he was using Steyr as his bases for the subject on bullpup design, unless of course, if anyone is able to send him a Singapore made bullpup rifle then he'll probably use it as his bases for the subject on bullpup.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br><br>By the way, the location of the XM8's charging handle is the same as a bullpup design.  Below the carry-handle.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"></div>
