Whats ur gripe against the harpoon ?</div></blockquote>The Harpoon missile first entered service in 1978 and has been upgraded numerous times since. However, even when compared to Soviet missiles of that era such as the AS-6 Kingfish and SS-N-12 'Sandbox' the Harpoon was at best mediocre in performance. The Soviet weapons had ranges of over 500km and had 2,200lb warheads as compared to the 500lb warhead of the Harpoon, not to mention higher speeds. The USA however had large numbers of Harpoons and since Soviet ships were not renown for their air defences, the capability was judged to be adequate, especially against SAMs like the SA-N-1 Goa and SA-N-3b Goblet meant primarily for the anti-aircraft role. The Harpoon missile was in fact a small part of the USN's anti-ship strategy which included the striking power of its over 60 SSNs and 12 aircraft carrier battle groups.<br><br>In recent years, new weapons such as the SS-N-26 (Yakhont) and SS-N-27 'Sizzler' offer performance surpassing even that of the Harpoon Block 2. New European missiles such as the MM40 Exocet Block 3 and NSM also present a potent threat to ships not equipped with adequate air defences. Singapore currently has the largest anti-ship missile inventory in the region comprising of several hundred Gabriel 2 and Harpoon missiles. However, they represent older technology and several shots would be required against modern warships operated by several SEA countries to ensure a kill.
