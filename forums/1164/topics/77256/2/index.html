JC students esp the guys.. very gu niang</blockquote>As a former JC student, the last 2 quotes irritated me especially. It's statements, and topics like this that keep fueling the JC vs Poly debate. Then it detoriates into a flame war.<br><br>What if I start saying "<span style="font-style: italic;">poly students are not as smart as JC students because most poly students cannot qualify for JC</span>"?<br><br>Following that i can make another statement saying "<span style="font-style: italic;">poly students not smart enough to wayang to get into OCS. Never ask question coz they're not smart enough to think of one. Their own problem.</span>"<br><br>They are sweeping statements that starts flaming in threads. <strong>The statements in italics are just examples to make my point and are not my personal beliefs</strong> (hey I have friends on polys too). I have no desire to turn this into another thread like "NS sucks" that goes on for 9 pages. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"></div>

I agree that most JC guys are less indepedent and i feel its a product of the system they are put thru. In Poly you are given alot of freedom to learn and to plan your own time, lecturerers dun spoonfeed you, as a result poly students are usually more independent.<br><br>Most poly students are more streetwise and mature, alot of JC guys I see still think like kids.</div>

I'm from a Poly and basically I think that those instructors from JC are real f***ed up. Just because they are from JC and have some stupid rank, they will  always want to have the authority above you. And I don't have common things to talk to JC people, because basically, our education system are very different from them and from what I know, they supposed to ask alot of questions during their studies and maybe that's how they ask question for every single thing. Besides, like what someone said, most of them are younger than the poly people and that's why, less mature. </div></blockquote>Not really true, my platoon got alot of JC guys, my understudy also all JC batch. Its true that JC guys and Poly guys think differently, in the beginning it was very hard to communicate with them but as we got to know each other some of us became firm friends.<br><br>But wat you say abt them asking questions is right, but the questions they ask are damn stupid and pointless most of the time, the more keng ones always give ridiculous excuse to siam work. It can be damn irritating at times.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Just to add - my experience in bmt was with JC guys...I can agree that we tend to complain but I think the amount was normal. During SAFINCOs, I was with both JC and Poly, same during SIgnals training - later we all got posted to the same unit.<br><br>Conclusion, we started off abit different - our perspectives and thinking were different but slowly after time, it didn't really matter if we were from poly or jc - you mix with those who you are ok with and distance yourself from those you can't get along i.e. their personality not whether they were from JC or poly.<br><br>As for geng kings and wayang - some of the poly guys that I knew (not a generalization) were blody gengsters - dun want to do work always giving farking excuses. Some were damn solid - if we had any problem with equipment, just go to them and they can troubleshoot it.<br><br>Same for the JC guys - some you utterly want to strangle cos they just dun want to work. *especially my juniors - hated their bitchy stupid crap ways. Some were fine - you do your job I do mine.<br><br>At the end, I think that there are differences in the way we think and see things but at the end, we are all in the same boat and those little differences doesn't make that big a impact after all.</div>

JC guys can compare likewise with JC gals? After JC guys complete their NS, JC gals complete uni. So while the guys study, the gals earn income. Where's their (the guys) lost income?<br><br>You compare stagnated training/knowledge, JC guys also in same situation? None of us have superb memory to remember stuff 2.5 years ago. You might not be able to adjust to working life and get fired, likewise JC guys might not be able to adjust to study life and just screw up that degree.<br><br><blockquote>Education shapes the person, how a person is taught will affect his thoughts and action.

What gives poly students that idea? Have they all actually been to a JC before? From what I know, the biggest difference is that in poly you can plan your time-table, while in JC they have fixed timetables. But does it matter that much?<br><br>I'm curious, in the poly do you poly students buy all the textbooks and then self-study? Is that what you all mean by " non-spoonfeeding " ? In any case, I'm in the uni now and i don't see much of a difference b/w the JC and uni system besides the timetable issue. It's all about lectures and tutorials, only that the uni has way larger crowds in lectures.<br><br>***<br><br>In the end all the misconceptions and underlying hate between poly/JC students stem from different education systems. JC students tend to sterotype poly students and vice versa.<br><br>Like how some JC students think poly students are stupid. With reference to the China dude who complained in the forums about how singaporeans are stupid, lazy and immature, some pro-JC-anti-poly people just said "<span style="font-style: italic;">That's coz he's in a poly what.</span>" Likewise, some poly students also label the JC people with the same "lazy stupid and immature" tag.<br><br><span style="color: blue;">JC and poly are both probably full of "lazy, stupid, immature and stuckup people", but students from both institutions tend to notice those from the other (instituition) more for some reason.</span><br><br>Having said that, no matter your fellow officer/spec/man came from the JC or poly or "bo tak cheh", chances are that once you all suffer through the same BS enough, you will get along someday and become pals. But if after all that crap you still hate that person, chances are that he's an a**hole <strong>everyone</strong> else hates too.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Stop and think for a minute, poly grads are supposed to join the work force after they ORD whereas JC students go on to uni to get their degree, even if they forget a few things they can pick it up during the first year in uni which is for building foundation anyway. Whats there to compare, poly grads are supposed to enter the workforce after their knowledge and skills are stagnated and forgotten, do you know how difficult is espscially for those in technical disciplines? Even if a JC guy forgets everything he learns, what he learns in uni may be different from wat he has learned in JC.</div>
