Out of all of my poly frens only a handful went on to study full time.<br><br>80~90% is exaggeration la, got quite alot go on to further sudies full time but most ppl that i know are taking part-time courses while working either part-time or full-time. I believe the number of poly students that go on to further studies full time are many but the number who join the workforce are as many or imo even more, anyone have any statistics?<br><br>As for a-level who dun further studies, im not sure of the number but i think its the exception rather than the rule. My only man who couldnt make it into uni retook his a-levels and managed to get a place the last i've heard.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>... poly grads are supposed to join the work force after they ORD whereas JC students go on to uni to get their degree, even if they forget a few things they can pick it up during the first year in uni ... poly grads are supposed to enter the workforce after their knowledge and skills are stagnated and forgotten, do you know how difficult is espscially for those in technical disciplines? Even if a JC guy forgets everything he learns, what he learns in uni may be different from wat he has learned in JC. </strong><br><br>After not using your brain for 2 years, picking up knowledge is not as easy as you think. Far from it. As JC students slowly pick up the habits of studying once again, poly students can pick up working techniques on the job once again. I hardly think bosses would be that hard on somebody fresh out of NS <strong>and</strong> new on the job. Moreover, I think don't think you will apply much of whatever you learnt in poly on the job, it's more likely you learn new things on the job. Lecturers on the other hand aren't that forgiving. You take your time to pick up disciplines, but in exams you either pass, or you fail and repeat, wasting a LOT of money in the process.<br><br><strong>As for the buying textbook and studying yourself part, that is only partly true, we are not required to buy textbooks, just have to get hold of them by hook or by crook. I dun want to go into specifics, just know that the poly i was in adopted a problem based learning methodology, you can find more info on it on the net if you want to know more.</strong><br><br>I fail to see any relavance. My point was that poly students seem to think the JC system is spoonfeeding the students. Since they've never been to one, how can they judge?<br><br><strong>As for uni being the same as JC, I've wondered if you have spoke to frens studying overseas eg, US UK Oz etc... </strong><br><br>I have quite a few friends in overseas unis. I fail to see any relevance again. If you're thinking overseas unis and your poly have superior teaching methods compared to local unis, I don't think that's the case. I haven't been to the poly so I can't comment. If you haven't been to a local uni, I don't think you can make an objective comment.<br><br>In any case, this is the wrong thread and forum for for a poly VS JC dedate. We're all losing track off the topic<br><br><span style="color: red;">which is "poly batch better than jc batch during bmt??"</span><br><br>During BMT yes. Poly batch in BMT is undeniably more mature in thinking because your youngest poly graduate is 19, with the average being 20 when they enter NS, while most JC students are 18 when they enter. So the poly students have a 1-2 year headstart. And even when the JC batch become instructors, they might be of the same age as the poly recuits.</div>

SAF game plan, fill out your building blocks , i.e. infantry battalion with whatever fit warm bodies you get.

Maybe some who take the vertical taxi to work (guards), or those who do silly things like jumping out of a particularly good working aricraft (cdo) adds some color with their multi color barets during the NDP.<br><br>Anyway I digress, no difference between the Air levels or the Poly pots that would matter cause what the SAF needs is sufficient fear and desperation not to f##k up (and do weekend guard duty) to maintain a credible fighting force.<br><br>Myself, I prefer the Hokkien Peng, Tamil Tigers and Malay silat exponents who populate my platoon anytime cause when the s**t hits the fan and the flag goes up the pole, only the man on your left and right matter (just make sure he is not behind you with a loaded weapon and the safety off, I have had my fair share of misfires; courtesy of the platoon fumble king who is in my section). Whatever your experience, wait till you do your third in-camp, thats when you realize that these clowns will be in the same foxhole when it comes down to the crunch.<br><br>(no offence to those easily miffed about being the pride of the SAF etc, we are all cannon fodder if any unit loses it when it counts)<br><br></div>
