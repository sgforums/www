            <div class='col-md body'>I have read a newspaper article from another forum saying that they are trying to pass a bill in parliament. The bill states that it will be mandatory for all male citizens aged between 18 to 45 to serve. This is to beef up the Indonesian defence. Please comment.

            <div class='col-md body'>Indonesia's military is mostly for territorial defense. The majority of its army for example, is used for territoral defense, prevent uprisings, internal security and keeping the peace within its assigned military regions and districts.<br><br>Any National Service plans for them will be likely for the same purpose. These units will be used for local security. However, this is not confirmed - there is debate, as funds for National Service can be used instead to improve the current all professional force.<br><br>I have visited and lived with Indonesian friends - its quite interesting to find out about the Indonesian military. They have a wide range of units.<br><br></div>

National Service is successfully implemented in Indonesia. Since you said Indonesian soldier have tougher field training than Singaporean soldier.

            <div class='col-md body'>From what I understand about theplan for the Indonesian National service is that it would be no different from that of the Malaysian National service.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_eek.gif" alt="Shocked" title="Shocked"><br><br>The ideal is that National service would enable the younger indonesian of different race or enthic background, religion, et cetra, to mix together in-order them to better understand each others cultural traditions, common history, religion, et cetra.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>The planned National service is more for the interest of National, &amp; internal, security.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_neutral.gif" alt="Neutral" title="Neutral"></div>
