We dun survive as a small red dot because people allow us to. We still exist because we are capable of defending ourselves.<br><br>Even NSFs think that way also.  But the strength of SAF lies in its reserves. We are an integrated army of various services and arms. Modern warfare require fire power and speed. Individually we may not be tough but we can rely on our collective strength to win a fight if neccessary.<br></div></blockquote>Actually, believe you me, majority of the reserve are serving for the sake of serving, to complete their reserve cycles.  Sure, the military tasks are on par with the active regular units, but everyone must bear in mind that, regardless of the 'fact' that we are well-trained and well-led when compared with the regional militaries, we are still a citizen army.  The long-term disadvantage of this when it was first started all off is that, there will be attitude problems among the ranks and files, and even extending to the officer corps.<br><br>Such a wasting disease in the psyche of such citizen soldiers actually pervade into the regular forces as well, since they are bogged down to double up as training cadres mostly for the reserve lot.  So, do not place too much confidence in such a citizen army formation like ours to win a war.  However, we will not be done in if we radically change or at least revert to the traditional methods as mentioned by the originator of this topic.<br><br>And, the readers should never stifle anyone here regarding his or her seniority or level of experience.

            <div class='col-md body'>What matters in our armed forces today is not the amount of new-fangled toys we have, but how professional our regulars and NSFs are.Professionalism plays a big role in ensuring that the army remains as an effective institution in times of crisises, able to deal with threats in a capable manner, unlike all our common "army cock-up" experience.In the case of regulars, they should undergo a paradigm shift in their attitudes, instead of thinking that the Army is a rice bowl which will never crack, or should I say , harder to crack than the private sector.Many regulars sign on with the mindset that the risk element is low, and that Singapore might never go to war in their lifetime.When you have such attitudes amongst the professional soldiers, their thinking will infect the entire corps and slowly work its way to every nook and cranny.<br><br>In my NSF experience, I have seen us conscripts, be it men, specs or officers, being tasked a great deal more to do in our daily jobs, much more than the seniors.Why might this be so?Some may say IT revolution, the "lau cheks" may be quite unfamiliar with the new toys the Army is implementing, (remember that they are usually O-level holders or below, for the case of the Warrant Officers, which are mainly the leaders on the ground).Perhaps because of this inadequacy. they make use of us to perform their tasks.It's okay, we are under orders.However, what irks me is the main attitude amongst them that they think its their God-given right and an entitlement for them to have helpers like us, working on stuff that they should be working on.What is needed is appreciation and acknowledgment that we did a good job and we provided assistance and support.This is not a crusade against the senior specialists as a whole, but I'm trying to point out that many of us feel used, and that's where the morose and despondancy appears, when we do a great deal and we are not recognised.So much for ISO, MEA and all that bull, because if you were to go down to the ground, you will realise that all these are just paid lip-service and the Army , exemplified by the narcissists that have their insidious grip on the NSFs, demands commercial standards of production but pays and rewards in a 13th century penury system.<br><br>The old generation will pass on soon enough.In order for the rot to be stemmed, we should inculcate proper values in our younger regulars and have in place a stringent psychometrical evaluation and tests to analyse a prospective applicant's mind and character.We should not just accept any fit Tom, Dick or Harry.An motivated smaller and educated force is much better than a large but unmotivated and parasitical force.We owe the taxpayers this much.Let it sink in or we might have a crisis of faith in our green hands.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I agree with previous post that<br><br><blockquote>motivated smaller and educated force is much better than a large but unmotivated and parasitical force</blockquote>If you ever met the RINCOS graduates (My SAFINCOS inctructors were last batch of RINCOS) then you will surely shoot yourself in the balls first!<br><br>They (Regular Inf NCS school) were pri school drop outs. Somthing like SAF Boys schools of late 80's (not sure present equal). Great LURRP or Ranger fodder but siao and see bay 'gilat'. They took 9 months to earn their corporal stripes (this is before the massive "everybody become 3SGT" happy days are here time). Everything they learn by doing over and over again. Very tough, they can do tactical casevac from Tekong East jetty to present BMT school (about 6km). You try 200m, can die already.<br><br>I have met many a SSG, MSG or 2WO who die die cannot beat the clock to be promoted before age cut off time. Same same for CPT and 12 yrs LTA (believe it there are many hidden in funny corners).<br><br>The only reason still (then) in SAF, cannot survive outside.<br><br>In new army, thinking army, sorry no place for them. Maybe many "keng kar liao". Some even more hopless than my grandmother ("why must do this that way, because always do that like this lah" is the only song they know).<br><br>Mind you it takes brute force to lift a section of the Bailey bridge (about 250kg), can you do with only 6 men for each section, putting all the two hundred fifty plus pieces within standard time, in the rain at night?<br><br>Yah lar we got iguana, two person press button also can. But some things like your triple con (600m), minefield (500m), 4,000+ sandbags for your BCP cannot be mechcanized. Assault boat PT another siong story.<br><br>We also cannot have pasley coordinated metrosexuals in the mud when the enemy are at the gates, how then?<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Yes.The onus is on the regulars to uphold the values.You cannot realistically expect the NSFs to shoulder the whole army.As a regular, you made the choice to sign the dotted line, you jolly well live up to your profession and not make use of conscripts to do your job.That is the most pathetic of actions and is also why we all say "Army buey kan." <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_twisted.gif" alt="Twisted Evil" title="Twisted Evil"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I do think Sardaukar is out of his depth in his "assessment" - sorry - but if any of today's NSF's &amp; NSmen can pass their IPPT, SOC, ATP, UC, vocation/leadership courses, etc. &amp; then help his unit to RECON 1 status in operational readiness, I'll pledge brotherhood with him anytime. Never mind the actual nature of training received; ditto 2.5 years or lesser.<br><br>The previous generations needed a different standard &amp; hence went for - I think this is the key word here - <strong>tougher regimentation</strong> due to the pre-enlistment personalities of their eras' conscipts (a lot of school dropouts &amp; anti-social indulgences).  You know, the whole character bit about tearing the civilian down &amp; building a soldier in its place. Nowadays we're still doing that as a principle, but there's also less collective resistance, prejudice or ambivalence from the participants.<br><br>In fact, I rate the current SAF draftees/reservists as very carte blanche, prodded by finely-tuned progams like Enhanced BMT &amp; IPPT window &amp; progressive RT. In some ways, IMHO we've moved on even from the '80s-'90s type of positive-reinforcement policies, &amp; that was in itself very different from the true "tekan", borderline-abusive punishment approach of the late 60s-'70s.</div>
