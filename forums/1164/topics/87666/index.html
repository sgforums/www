            <div class='col-md body'>Of course most of you don't want to be there.Understandable as you don't want to be restricted in your freedom.<br><br>However,whether you like it or not,it is your duty and it is inevitable.You either accept it as a part of your reality and change your attitude to make the best of it and think of it as an exposure to the military system,a way to test your limits and challenge yourself,or you can rebel against it and just slack and be an incompetent,inproficient fool who is wasting an opportunity to contribute constructively to the security of society.<br><br>As I have said and will reiterate,the armed forces is a military institution with the purpose of protecting the national interest and integrity as well as deter possible foreign intervention.We have succeeded very well in the deterrence arena until now,but with the current social situation,with increasingly educated servicemen,overprotective parents and an increasingly consultative government,the military is in for hard times in maintaining its standards which have dropped.<br><br>The main problem from my view is that the military is pandering to a populist government.While it is all very well and fine to consult the population on matters related to civil,cultural,social and economic affairs of the state,we cannot allow such consultation to affect the military.It is the demands of overprotective parents that is degrading the operational capability and proficiency of the individual soldier,thereby affecting their unit.<br><br>As a military institution,the SAF has a duty to defend our society,and to do this they have to resort to conscripting from among the civilian population and maintaining them as reservists after a tour of service,to maintain the numbers of an effective fighting force and deterrent force.To that end,it has to train troops that are physically and mentally resilient,a task it succeeded with in the past,thought less so now.This entails training,which has its risks.The responsibility of the SAF as a military institution is to look after the welfare of each individual soldier,for they are the most vital and important elements of the SAF as a whole.In looking after their welfare,they most they can humanly do is to minimise the risks presented in training by and providing medical personnel to treat injuries.Now,the present perception is that they are looking after the welfare of the troops,but at the cost of compromising on operational capability and ability,which should <span style="color: red;">not</span> be the case.A balance has to be struck between the welfare of our soldiers and the operational capability of the SAF.Currently,the balance seems to be skewed in looking after the welfare of the conscripts and troops at the cost of operational ability.<br><br>The deaths of our fellow servicemen,while tragic,and preventable,were still accidents,and accidents happen.You can only minimise the chances of them happening.However,due to the political requirements necessitated by the accidents,it has resulted in the imposition of legal limits that hamper and restrict the judgement and authority of PTIs and other commanders as well as trainers in ensuring the maximum possible mental resilience,physical resilience and vocational proficiency of the individual soldier and/or unit is reached.<br><br>There needs to be reforms undertaken to curb the further degradation of standards in the SAF and raise standards,and there needs to be a clear position taken by the army in resisting the pressure of the civilian population,to show its authority and to state clearly its role and purpose in Singapore.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>first to bcoy,<br><br>if one should comment on NS matters only after they have been through the system, then i guess almost all of us can't vote since we know next to nothing on governing a country. and there are lots of service men whose attitude that the SAF can do without, does that mean their opinions matter if they so decide give them after their term of service. i guess my message is, so long it's well founded, veterans or not, any ideas/input is welcome.<br><br>to sardaukar,<br><br>broadly, i kinda agreed with what you've said. i believe that 2 years is too short a time for us to train our servicemen to a level of proficiency that will not threaten their own, and their units', survival in time of operation. friends in service have related to me how, from enlistment to posting to units, a serviceman will likely have less than 12 months to work and gel with his mates. and that's in active service. and when they become a NS unit, they will have, at most, 40 days a year to play soldier. I 'm not quite sure how what one was unable to master in 12 mths, one can improve on in (not quite) 40 days out of 365.<br><br>as for the case of enlisting women, i don't see the harm. i'm not train in economic but my feeling is that, the current non family-friendly HR practices and general biasness against anyone above 40 years is doing more harm to Singapore's competitiveness than a time-limited uniform service for the fairer sex.<br></div>

We dun survive as a small red dot because people allow us to. We still exist because we are capable of defending ourselves.<br><br>Even NSFs think that way also.  But the strength of SAF lies in its reserves. We are an integrated army of various services and arms. Modern warfare require fire power and speed. Individually we may not be tough but we can rely on our collective strength to win a fight if neccessary.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>From an initial point of view, I do agree that the current conscripts are getting a better lifestyle than their predecessors. Your conclusion of them having less fighting spirit is also justifiable, given the amount of people who <span style="font-style: italic;">keng</span> at any chance they get.<br><br>You should understand that most of the kids who go in are often disgruntled and not so motivated. They feel that there's nothing to fight for in this period of peace, exhibiting the sense of complacency as a result. Many of them probably have the notion of desertion at the first sign of trouble. Hence the need to fill a survey form on your very first day of enlistment.<br><br>The people who've actually gone through the combat training can tell you that there may be room for improvement, but majority would agree that there is no need for us to go back to the heavy regimental days of "Mexican" instructors.

It is no better or worst now.<br><br>Life as footsolider is tough (I am a Pioneer NCO with 2PDF). Don't get any ideas that the PDF is "senang". Our basic operational requirements are sufficient to make many a grown man cry, much worst than my active day (when I was in infantry).<br><br>In ICT yr 2, we constructed the Battlion Command Post after some 48hrs non-stop work. Slept a grand total of 2 hours over that same period. Then went on to build barbed wire emplacements as well as a mixed minefield. That was just at the start of the exercise.<br><br>Only way it could have been done was because we had to be mentally tough. This is as a result of our BMT being a bit like the scenes from "full metal jacket" (go see the movie).<br><br>Always believed that being mentally solid was most valuable part from the rough and tumble days of my NSF. This may be lacking nowadays, I could be wrong. Even with the best technology, the last man left standing is really "king of the hill" in more ways than you can ever reliaze from playing all those first player shoot-em-up games.

            <div class='col-md body'>Well,so far you guys missed out a essential point.Can you take a look at how our Military is run?Its like a friggin' company.Even OCS and SAFTI MI are known as OCS Corporate and SAFTI Corporate.My goodness,the ministry of defence is supposed to be a WAR FIGHTING institution and not a goddamned company.How is it possible to ascertain a certain credibility of the armed forces if you were to treat it like a company?Why not simply hire a mercernary armed forces to help defend our country?<br><br>Why is NS being reduced by 6 mths?Simply because its simply does not make Dollars and Cents for the Ministry.AS such, service term is being reduced.And to those who always say that they are NSF/ Reservists/Regulars, please, do not show how much you know simply because you have served.This is an analytical theme.The government of S'pore like to privatise so many things,I mean I won't be surprised if one day, the military will become privatised.</div>
