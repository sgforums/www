It's unprecedented - so many deaths in one day."<br><br>"We are sorry that those youths had to lose their lives because, as the authorities said, they were misled by those with ill intentions," he said.<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Mosque attack </span><br><br>Clashes took place near 10 police outposts around the southern provinces. One particularly bloody battle erupted in the Krue Se mosque in Pattani - where up to 38 people reportedly lost their lives.<br><br>Police fired tear gas and rocket-propelled grenades into the mosque, village headman Waedaloh Hayeesohoh told the Associated Press news agency.<br><br>Five security personnel are said to be among those killed in Wednesday's violence, compared with more than 100 insurgent deaths.<br><br>Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra said the toll among security forces was low because the militants had only been armed with machetes and a few guns.<br><br>He described those who carried out the attacks as "youths from the southern provinces" whose actions were "not linked with international terrorists".<br><br>But some analysts have voiced concerns that the attackers could have links to militant groups outside Thailand.<br><br>One of the men killed in Wednesday's violence was found to be wearing a shirt with JI emblazoned on the back - a possible reference to Jemaah Islamiah, the group blamed for terrorist attacks across South East Asia, including the Bali bombings.<br><br><img src="http://newsimg.bbc.co.uk/media/images/40090000/jpg/_40090765_ji2_treat_203.jpg"><br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Government crackdown </span><br><br>Many observers say the current troubles in Thailand's south have been exacerbated by the government's own policy of cracking down on militants.<br><br>Islamic community leaders say the tactics employed by security forces have been heavy-handed, and may have served to encourage those who already felt disenfranchised.<br><br>The alienation felt by Thailand's Muslim minority has been the source of a decades-old separatist struggle, which decreased in intensity after an amnesty in the late 1980s but resurfaced again this January.<br><br>Thailand is predominantly Buddhist, with its 4% Muslim population concentrated in the troubled southern provinces - Pattani, Yala, Songkhla and Narathiwat.<br></div>
