US want something airborne,quick deployment and offer some protection with speed and light weight while the Israel only operates in their region which require no air transportation that's why all their stuff is so heavy(strong armour)</div>

Most likely it would be the older versions of the Merkava with the turret removed.<br><br><a href="http://www.strategypage.com//fyeo/howtomakewar/default.asp?target=HTARM.HTM" rel="nofollow">http://www.strategypage.com//fyeo/howtomakewar/default.asp?target=HTARM.HTM</a><br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">January 11, 2005: Israel has decided not to buy American Stryker wheeled armored vehicles for two of its infantry brigades. Instead, it has designed a new armored personnel carrier (APC) based on the chassis of older Merkava I and II series tanks. These tanks are being retired, and one such Merkava I is being turned into a prototype of the new Â“NemerahÂ” (Â“TigressÂ”) vehicle. This APC  has the thick armor of the Merkava, but the turret is removed and a remotely controlled (from inside the vehicle) heavy machine-gun would be added. The Merkava lends itself to this kind of modification, because the engine is mounted in the front and there is already a door in the back of the vehicle. The Israelis liked the speed of the Stryker, but they apparently feel they will still be fighting in urban areas, against Palestinian terrorists, in the next ten years. There, the Nemerah has an edge, because of its thicker armor. Out in the open, the Stryker has the edge. If the Israelis cannot afford to build the Nenerah, they will add armor to their existing supply of M-113 APCs. </span><br><br>For disscusions on Israel's concept of IFV vs APC and light vs heavy, visit the tanknet forums.<br><br>Anyway - back to the topic on Singapore's light armoured vehicles - not too sure if the V200 will be replaced by the Terrex or Bronco. (both can do peacekeeping as well)<br><br></div>
