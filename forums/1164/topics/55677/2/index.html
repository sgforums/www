            <div class='col-md body'>Not so. There was an exercise where British Link-16 equipped Sea Harriers squared off against Eagles. The Eagles got chewed up in BVR combat. The Blue Vixen radar in the Sea Harriers is actually more capable than the APG-63s. It is IIRC, the first radar designed to make full use of the AMRAAM, and the ECR-90 CAPTOR radar is in fact based on the Blue Vixen. Too bad the Sea Harriers are gonna be retired....</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>The Harrier is an amazing little dogfighter, and has scored notable sucesses against supposedly superior supersonic, air superiority fighters. In the Falklands, the Harriers chewed up the Argentine airforce's Mirages, Skyhawks and what not. Notable was a Mirage's lack of sucess with dealing with the slow, subsonic Harrier.<br><br>I dunno if the brits used VIFFing, but that has always been a very big advantage of the Harrier. Most dogfights take place at subsonic speeds, where manuverability and low speed handeling is an king rather then speed and trust. While the poor Mat pilot is pulling gees trying to get his overpowered plane around, all the brit has to do is to clip his plane into a VIFF manuver and point it at the Mig with far less cost in time and effort. No gusses who actually has the real advantage there.<br><br>In any case, a Mig 29 is a poor trade for a Harrier. That's multimillion dollar, super high preforming aircraft was supposed to be able to beat the relatively cheap by comparism, slow mud mover all the time round.<br><br>I suspect, given the same, large boresight missiles used by the Mig, the Harrier would win virtually everytime in a WVR engagement. Prehaps the Harrier's main defiency is it's lack of juice to evade missiles, but then again, most modern air superiority fighters also only stand a marginal chance of dodging missiles once they are fired at them. The idea is to get the first shot off.<br><br>Maybe there's still some magic left in that old british ingeunity...<br></div>

It was hyped up by British media then.<br><br>Fact is  the Brit entered the war with very marginal advantage over the Argintines with only 20+ Harriers &amp;  zero Awacs. That was why Exocet was the most feared by the British fleet. US's greenlight to give the Brits their  brandnew Aim-9L also contributed to better KP.<br><br>Harrier's main advantage that time was her logistic flexibility which was demonstrated by flying off a  civilian container during its long voyage south.<br><br>Total 6 Harriers were lost by SAM and accidents.<br><br></div>

It will carry light Air-to-Ground ordance. And because of its VSTOL capability, it is supposed to be deployed very very close to the frontline maybe off the normal airfield, so that its short-range doesn't matter. Somehow the Brits think that having a short-legged aircraft that can carry a light load is better than having a more capable aircraft deployed far away. That was/is their doctrine. But as shown in the Falklands, the Harrier was very vulnerable to ground fire.<br><br>The Blue Vixen is really a very old design. It was first put into the RN Harrier to give it a air-intercept capability (the original RAF Harriers are for ground-attack).<br><br>One comment on VIFFing. It is actually sucidal to VIFF. the aircraft will lose all its forward speed and will need time to accelerate back to combat speed. In the meantime it is vulnerable to attack, litterally sitting duck.<br><br>Air combat need not be a one-vs-one kind of fight. Even if one opponent over-shoot you (after VIFFing) there could be another enemy waiting to prounce on you while you are floating in mid-air.<br><br>As for classic movements like VIFFing, vertical take-off and landing and the Russian "Cobra", all these manuvers are done in an air-show setting. The Harrier "cannot" take-off with a full bombload, that is why they need a ski-jump on the carrier. The Harrier in the probably only have half a fuel load.<br><br>Same as Cobra etc.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Nope, it is not sucidal to VIFF, as a matter of fact, it is extremely useful in a turning contest. Esp. in getting extremely high AOA shots, increasing rate of turn and make shot-cut manuvers impossible for conventional aircraft.<br><br>VIFFing has never been used in a combat encounter, and its potential has never been fully realized and utilized. For years it remained a curiosity. The real reason VIFFing has never really been used in combat is more because I believe the Harrier never really got into a situtation where it had to use it, coupled with the general incompetence of their enemy plus their own aversion to unconventional flying in a combat situtation.<br><br>However, expermental dogfights held by the US Marines a few years back after the aquired the AV-8B to discover the usefulness of VIFFing in air to air engagements. They were pitted against Navy F-14s in close quarter dogfights and used VIFFing manuvers to jockey for advantage. The AV-8Bs won 23 of 25 engagements. Not bad for a mud mover.<br><br>VIFFing is hardly sucidal, if anything should its real potential be realized, actually life saving.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I believe Singapore at one time (sometime in the 80s) was entertaining the idea of getting Harriers.  However, Harriers was considered too difficult to fly and at that time, too many accidents cause this idea to be seriously considered. Furthermore, the AV-8B and Harrier 2 used today was not widely available then, so AV-8A was deemed too expensive as the A-4 replacement. The Skyhawks then went and got a new life with a new engine and avionics to boot.<br><br>Well, when and if RSAF obtain F-35, it will not be inconceivable to get some the VTOL version as well. Getting say a sqn of VTOL F35 and 2 sqns of CTOL (land based version) will be more palatable as there will be common parts (important for logistic pov) and infrastructure (maintenance and cost benefits) between the 2 different versions.<br><br>I also read that F35 might be considered as one of the possibility for the NGF program, huh, is RSAF going to be 1 of the first to adopt a new generation and unproven fighter?  Anyway, I hope Rafale will win and Singapore reap the many technology benefits. Of course, that also means Singapore will have to pay a hefy financial cost to this choice. My guess is the Block 60 Viper or the F15 will come through as the winner. No points for guessing why.<br><br></div>

For years it remained a curiosity.

            <div class='col-md body'>The harrier pilot in control can do various angles of thrust vector from full downwards vectoring to what u mentioned selective angle of vectoring.<br><br>When he do a quick and full downward vectoring, he would suddenly have a very quick "deccelaration" of his airspeed from 280 to 320 knots to almost as slow as 50 to 70 knots, and at the same time he would get a lot of height (ballooning in his own plane altitude), this is extremely great for the harrier if he has a close enemy fighter at six.
