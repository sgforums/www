              <p><strong>Unveiled: The new supergun weapon against the Taliban can kill from over a mile away</strong></p>
              <p>It is the latest weapon on the front line against the Taliban - the
              British Army's most powerful-ever sniper rifle, capable of killing with
              pinpoint accuracy from more than a mile away. <br> <br> Yesterday the Army showed off its new Long Range Rifle, which has just
              entered service with combat units in Afghanistan to replace smaller and
              less powerful weapons. <br> <br> The £11million upgrade programme is part of a "renaissance" of the
              sniper tradition - which during the Cold War was largely relegated to
              the sidelines - as modern commanders rediscover the huge value of
              pinpoint fire from sharpshooters. <br> <br> The new weapon, the L115A3, fires a heavier bullet to much longer
              ranges and has a state-of-the-art telescopic sight with twice the
              magnifying power of the old version. <br> More than 500 are on order from the British manufacturers, Accuracy International.  <br> <br> Since British forces moved into Helmand Province two years ago to take
              on the Taliban, demand for snipers has soared and 120 a year are now
              passing through the specialist training school at Warminster in
              Wiltshire. <br> <br> One said: "It's a huge step forward. I'll be using the new rifle in Afghanistan this summer.  <br> <br> "It's a little heavier to carry, but the extra power is worth it. The
              improved telescopic sight can cut through the heat haze, which was
              preventing us from spotting targets at longer ranges." <br> <br> Sniping is proving a hugely-important tactic in Afghanistan, where the
              difficulty of fighting among maze-like compounds and thick vegetation
              necessitates attacking the enemy at long range. <br> <br> The controversy over so-called "collateral damage" from devastating
              airstrikes killing innocent civilians adds to the advantages of a
              pinpoint attack. <br> <br> A senior officer at the Weapons Support School in Warminster said:
              "With the new rifle we now expect to be able to engage a target at
              1,500 metres. With the old version it was about 1,000 metres. <br> <br> "That makes a massive difference. You can keep the enemy at arm's
              length with snipers. Or you can have several of them firing
              simultaneously. <br> <br> "It is devastating for an enemy's morale if a number of their fighters
              are suddenly shot at the same instant, and they can't even see where
              the firing is coming from. They tend to withdraw fast." <br> <br> Training an infantryman to become a sniper can take up to a year, and
              only the most talented soldiers are allowed even to start the demanding
              courses. <br> <br> First a candidate must master the technical aspects of shooting,
              learning to judge the strength of the wind extremely accurately using a
              variety of clues, and to adjust aim accordingly. <br> <br> Just as importantly a sniper must learn to track his prey, move into
              position with extreme stealth, camouflage himself perfectly whether in
              natural cover or a battle-scarred city, and then disappear just as
              stealthily. <br> <br> The senior officer said: "There is a long waiting list. Battalions are
              desperate to send soldiers here for training, and every soldier wants
              to be a sniper. <br> <br> "They're held in extremely high regard. This new rifle will make them even more effective." <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <em>Source: Daily Mail UK, Mar. 7, 2008</em></p>
