            <div class='col-md body'>Normally such raid are not conducted by the regular forces. Its basically a sweep to kill as many militants as possible then pull out. Remember somalia, its a typical raid gone wrong.<br><br>On the other hand, i doubt US has enough troops to dig in at every objective. The new iraqi army is still at its infancy and the numbers who go AWOL each week are more than the numbers killed in combat.<br><br>Everybody have to agree US policy in iraq is a failure, but i agree with bush on one thing, they can't pull out now. They have to clean up the shit or else they might have to return for gulf war 3.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Erm spencer, do note that the US forces ARE doing that now.  Raiding and holding.  They have the resources and manpower to do it.  Logistically, its not that  difficult.  In fact, it helps with the logistics, cos u got mini-logistics bases in each town.<br><br>I'm not saying u got to EVERY town and dig in.  U dig into strategic towns, that forces the enemy to retreat into another, and another and another, until u have him cornered to the wall.<br><br>They US has enough manpower to carry out such tactics, they just never thought of it.  U'd think they'd have learnt their lessons from vietnam.<br><br>In the real world, it won't happen until u plan for it to happen.  It appears now that the US raid and raid tactics have a lack of strategic objective til now.</div>
