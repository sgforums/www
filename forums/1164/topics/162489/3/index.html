One of my COs was ex-SOF .  He used to do his own non-tactical recce of the training/ exercise area, even tho' we had a scout section and a full estab of Ops guys ( who are supposed to do this). He will take one of the scout motorcycles and conduct his own recce and come back and report to our S3 !</div>
