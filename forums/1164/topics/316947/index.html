              <p>contd of quote:''2 years of work for S’pore<br>team to make lab-in-chip</p>
              <p>WHEN reading reports<br>of the 1995 sarin gas attack<br>in Japan, Dr Loke<br>Weng Keong, the head of DSO’s<br>medical counter-measures<br>(chemical) lab, was concerned<br>that most of the 500 people who<br>rushed to hospitals were actually<br>not affected.<br>Ten years later, Dr Loke, 39,<br>attended a seminar conducted<br>by Nanyang Technological University<br>(NTU) Associate Professor<br>Nguyen Nam Trung, 38.<br>It was there that he realised<br>that Dr Nguyen, the thermal<br>and fluids researcher, had the expertise<br>which could help identify<br>people exposed to nerve<br>agents in a terrorist attack.<br>Dr Loke approached Dr<br>Nguyen to work on finding a<br>portable device that can detect<br>sarin easily. DSO research engineer,<br>Ms Tan Hsih Yin, 25 –<br>then an undergraduate in NTU,<br>also joined the team.<br>DSO is Singapore’s primary<br>defence research organisation.<br>Their two years of hard work<br>has now paid off. The result is<br>the power of a lab on the size of<br>a chip. The tool about the size of<br>a credit card enables mass<br>screening to be done anywhere.<br>This ensures that the genuinely<br>exposed can receive treatment<br>quickly, and also reassures<br>the rest that they are not exposed.<br>At very low levels, symptoms<br>of the sarin nerve agent – headache<br>and nausea – is similar to<br>those induced by fear, Dr Loke,<br>said.<br>Hospital facilities in Japan<br>were severely strained by the<br>500 people who rushed to hospitals<br>for tests to see if they had<br>been exposed to the gas in 1995,<br>said Dr Loke.<br>“In the end, 99 per cent were<br>actually not affected,” he pointed<br>out. The attack left 12 dead.<br>The chip is based on Scentmate<br>– another nerve agent diagnostic<br>kit developed by DSO.<br><span style="color: #ff0000;">Like Scentmate,</span> it can screen<br>96 people within half an hour.<br>For Scentmate to work, it requires<br>several equipment to run<br>a five-step screening procedure.<br>For the new device, these<br>equipment have been shrunk to<br>the size of a credit card. This<br>makes it easier for responders in<br>bulky protective suits to use.<br>Before Scentmate and this<br>new device was developed, it<br>took 16 hours to screen as many<br>samples in a laboratory said Dr<br>Loke.<br>The new device works like<br>this.<br>First, a drop of blood is collected<br>and placed on the chip. It<br>is then mixed with a chemical solution<br>to extract the sarin agent.<br>After that, the rest of the blood<br>is removed.<br>The mixture containing the<br>nerve agent is then passed<br>through a biosensor in the chip.<br>Finally, the device is connected<br>to an external detector, from<br>which the results can be retrieved.<br>The team was given a<br>$50,000 grant from the Ministry<br>of Defence for this research.<br><span style="color: #ff0000;">Their findings were published<br>by UK-based Royal Society<br>of Chemistry last month.</span><br>The chip can also be used for<br>other applications, like detecting<br>excessive levels of agriculture<br>pesticides in farmers.<br>The chip may land up on supermarket<br>shelves eventually if<br>companies decide that there is a<br>market for it, said Dr Loke.<br>If fear – the main weapon of<br>terrorists – is reduced, the appeal<br>of using chemical agents<br>for terrorist attacks will be lowered,<br>he said.<br>“Mass hysteria is contagious,”<br>he said.<br>sandrea@sph.com.sg''end of quote..</p>

              <p>1.SG will not compete with other giants in mega projects.</p>
              <p>But she will spend efforts on niche and important areas</p>
              <p>which will not appear very grand in medias photos,like missiles</p>
              <p>,space adveutures etc</p>
              <p>Do u think SG cant send a spaceman in a Russia space craft,like</p>
              <p>MY did?</p>

              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">in medias.This may endanger their lives or their family!!!</span></p>

              <p>is this a weapon of mass destruction? is this technology so sophisticated that others must kidnap them in order to have it? cant they just buy one and afterwhich produce their own like sg did with the 6 new stealth ships?</p>
