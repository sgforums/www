            <div class='col-md body'>I think due to those pure grenade launcher gun with rounds drum available that makes having an attached grenade launcher on rirles not popular.<br><br>Those one can fire many rds without reloading.

It was found that repeated use of a rifle for launching grenades by this method caused damage to the barrel, which is what lead to the cup/adapter technique. The need to load a blank cartridge at the same time as the rifle grenade proved difficult in combat. Attempting to use a live round with either a stick or cup grenade launcher would have disastrous results.<br><br>Diff type of ammo for diff type of grenade bah... Some use live some use blanks.

            <div class='col-md body'>Many years ago, there was a grenade for the M-16 that looks like a bowling ball and look nearly as large. If I remember correctly it was for demolishing walls or something.<br><br>Anyone else remember this?<br><br>Rifle grenades were the original way of launching grenades with a rifle.<br><br>The M-79 (grandfather of M203) was a more recent development - Vietnam War.<br><br>Even then, some armies continued to develop rifle-launched grenades including - if I'm not wrong - the IDF with the Galils. And yes, you need to load a blank.<br><br><img src="http://www.dnmsport.com/GALIL/weapons3.jpg"><br><br>The preference for M203-type over a rifle-launched grenaded is obvious:<br><br>If after attaching a grenade to the rifle muzzle, the grenadier cannot shoot if an enemy soldier suddenly appear 2m near him. With a M203-type weapon, no problem. You can load the grenade, put M203 to safe, and continue engaging with 5.56.<br><br>THis is the reason why most armies switched over to the GL underslung like the M203.<br><br>The next reason is that having to load a blank round or change mags after you have already wasted time attaching a grenade to the muzzle is just too time-consuming. And the nightmare scenario is firing a live round into the grenade instead of a blank one.<br><br>Yes there are those where you don't have to change ammo. But by the time these were developed most armies have lost interest.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>The bowling ball grenade I mentioned earlier is actually aan anti-tank grenade. It was developed by Brunswick (bowling ball company?) and had no takers:<br><br>New ideas for the Brunswick Rifleman's Assault Weapon (RAW)<br><br>The Brunswick RAW was an interesting weapon that showed considerable destructive potential. In form it was a spherical 6" diameter rocket propelled rifle grenade. The original model had a HESH warhead but later models had a HEAT warhead with a laser proximity fuse. The Launch mechanism was also quite novel. The grenade fitted in a bracket under the rifle's muzzle and some of the gas from firing a ball round was diverted to launch the grenade.  Whilst the warhead was effective, it was probably the launching mechanism that prevented the concept catching on.  Two improvements suggest themselves.<br>bullet<br><br>Firstly, to give the grenade its own propellant charge in a launch tube that mounts underneath the fore-end of the rifle. This would be more efficient and better balanced.<br>bullet<br><br>The second is to take the warhead, mate it to a rocket motor and fire it from a low signature recoilless launch tube to create a lightweight but potent LAW system.<br><br><a href="http://www.g2mil.com/West-anti-armor.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.g2mil.com/West-anti-armor.htm</a></div>
