            <div class='col-md body'>One report I read said that one of the reasons for the ROK's success is because of brutality.<br><br>They brought their deep hatred of communist from their own bitter experience of the Korean War over to Vietnam. So to them it is as if they are fighting Korean War 2 in Vietnam.<br><br>They were ruthless in the areas that they controlled and probably tortured and killed far more people than the NVA or VC put together. Needless to say, innocent people were not always spared either.<br><br>As far as the ROK were concerned, the Vietnamese people were either communist or know someone who is a communist.<br><br>It was reported that communist activites in the ROK AO were nearly zero.<br><br>Whether this is good or not I leave it to you.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Most remarkable point of Puerto Rico 65th in Korean War is its braveness to enable US 1st Marine Division withdrew from famous Chosin Reservoir in dec,1950, when the Marines were encircled by the PLA. However, the overall gloomy big retreat of the UN force including the 1st Marine Division was started by the easily collapse of ROK II Corp overrun by Chinese troops, that not only made the supposed to be centered 2 US Infantry Divisions become flank units of the whole 8th Army &amp; X Corp, but also, The overrun of the ROK II Corp post allowed PLA infiltrated several regiments into the heights that overlooking the only retreat route of the US 25th , 2nd divisions  and Turkish brigades. The late fate of these retreated units were doomed obviously, ironically, from the size of PLA infiltrated units( several reigments), that the force overran ROK II Corp was never big, considering ROK II Corp   was made of 4 Divisions<br><br><a href="http://www.korean-war.com/TimeLine/1950/11-23to12-31-50.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.korean-war.com/TimeLine/1950/11-23to12-31-50.html</a><br><br><blockquote><span style="color: blue;">By shortly after midnight a confused battle was taking place all three 2 ID regiments were engaged but had been fragmented into company and part battalion sized units by infiltrating Chinese and were attacking units from all directions. Another CCF regiment infiltrated across the Ch'ongch'on River north of Kunu-ri and attacked the two reserve battalion 23rd and the three artillery battalions. This attack was turned but the Chinese withdrew to a mountain known as "Chinaman's Hat", located northeast of the 23rd but south of the rearmost positions of the 9th. Fighting tapered off at dawn but by noon word arrived that<strong> ROK II Corps 7th &amp; 8th Divisions had been overrun and ROK II Corps was retreating in mass, thus making the 2 ID not only the flank unit for IX corps but also for Eighth Army. The route of ROK II Corps allowed the Chinese to infiltrate several regiments and turn them toward the mountains overlooking the road between Kunu-ri and Sunch'on, the 2 ID &amp; Turkish Brigades withdrawal route.</strong> It also allowed the Chinese to attack down the road toward Kunu-ri. To counter these incursions, the 1st Cavalry Division moved to take up positions at Sunch'on and the road leading east from there. The Turkish Brigade received orders to move from Kunu-ri eastward to Tokch'on and clear the town.<br><br>Far to the west in I Corps area the 24th ID was ordered to halt its advance and be prepared to withdraw back to the Ch'ongch'on. The same order went out to the ROK 1st Division.</span></blockquote></div>
