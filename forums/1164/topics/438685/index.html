              <p><strong>War on the 'Red Empire': How America planned for an attack on BRITAIN in 1930 with bombing raids and chemical weapons </strong></p>
              <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">- Emerging world power feared British reaction to its ambitions</span></p>

              <p style="margin-bottom: 0px; min-height: 1px;"><span>Details of an amazing American military plan for an attack to wipe out a major part of the British Army  are today revealed for the first time.</span></p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0px; min-height: 1px;"> </p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0px; min-height: 1px;"><span>In 1930, a mere nine years before the outbreak of World War Two, America drew up proposals specifically aimed at eliminating all British land forces in Canada and the North Atlantic, thus destroying Britain's trading ability and bringing the country to its knees. </span></p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0px; min-height: 1px;"> </p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0px; min-height: 1px;"><span>Previously unparalleled troop movements were launched as an overture to an invasion of Canada, which was to include massive bombing raids on key industrial targets and the use of chemical weapons, the latter signed off at the highest level by none other than the legendary General Douglas MacArthur. </span></p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0px; min-height: 1px;"> </p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0px; min-height: 1px;"><span>The plans, revealed in a Channel 5 documentary, were one of a number of military contingency plans drawn up against a number of potential enemies, including the Caribbean islands and China. There was even one to combat an internal uprising within the United States.</span></p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0px; min-height: 1px;"> </p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0px; min-height: 1px;"><span>In the end there was no question of President Franklin D. Roosevelt subscribing to what was known as War Plan Red. Instead the two countries became the firmest of allies during WW2, an occasionally strained alliance that continues to this day.</span></p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0px; min-height: 1px;"> </p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0px; min-height: 1px;"><span>Still, it is fascinating that there were enough people inside the American political and military establishment who thought that such a war was feasible. </span></p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0px; min-height: 1px;"> </p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0px; min-height: 1px;"><span>While outside of America, both Churchill and Hitler also thought it a possibility during the 30s - a time of deep economic and political uncertainty. <br></span></p>

              <p style="margin-bottom: 0px; min-height: 1px;"> </p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0px; min-height: 1px;"><span>British feeling against America was known to be reciprocal. <br></span></p>

              <p style="margin-bottom: 0px; min-height: 1px; font-weight: bold;"><span>Not surprisingly, many of these were hypothetical exercises - and provided only broad strategic outlines.</span></p>

              <p style="margin-bottom: 0px; min-height: 1px;"> </p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0px; min-height: 1px;"><span>Stemming from Churchill and Roosevelt, it has since flourished - from Thatcher and Reagan, and Clinton and Blair, to the Queen and Obama. </span></p>

              <p style="margin-bottom: 0px; min-height: 1px;"><span>We know now that FDR ultimately rejected an invasion of Britain as 'wholly inapplicable'.</span></p>

              <p style="margin-bottom: 0px; min-height: 1px;"><span>But just how special was that relationship in the decade leading up to WWII?<br></span></p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0px; min-height: 1px;"><span>By the start of the 1920s, the American economy was booming.</span></p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0px; min-height: 1px;"> </p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0px; min-height: 1px;"><span>The 'Roaring Twenties' was an age of increased consumer spending and mass production.</span></p>

              <p style="margin-bottom: 0px; min-height: 1px;"><span>But after the First World War, U.S. public opinion was becoming increasingly isolationist.</span></p>

              <p style="margin-bottom: 0px; min-height: 1px;"><span>This was reflected in its refusal to join the League of Nations, whose principal mission was to maintain world peace.</span></p>

              <p style="margin-bottom: 0px; min-height: 1px;"><span>U.S. foreign policy continued to cut itself off from the rest of the world during that period by imposing tariffs on imports to protect domestic manufacturers.</span></p>

              <p style="margin-bottom: 0px; min-height: 1px;"><span>Millions of people, mainly from Europe, had previously been welcomed to America in search of a better life.</span></p>

              <p style="margin-bottom: 0px; min-height: 1px;"><span>But by 1921, quotas were introduced and, by 1929, only 150,000 immigrants per year were allowed in.</span></p>

              <p style="margin-bottom: 0px; min-height: 1px;"><span>The ensuing economic hardship and mass unemployment sealed the fate of President Herbert Hoover's re-election - and Franklin D Roosevelt stormed to victory in March 1933.</span></p>

              <p style="margin-bottom: 0px; min-height: 1px;"><span>And the reality of a worldwide economic depression and the need for increased attention to domestic problems only served to bolster the idea that the U.S. should isolate itself from troubling events in Europe.</span></p>

              <p style="margin-bottom: 0px; min-height: 1px;"><span>In 1933, President Roosevelt proposed a Congressional measure that would have granted him the right to consult with other nations to place pressure on aggressors in international conflicts. <br></span></p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0px; min-height: 1px;"><span>The bill faced strong opposition from leading isolationists in Congress.</span></p>

              <p style="margin-bottom: 0px; min-height: 1px;"><span>Although Roosevelt was not in favour of the policy, he acquiesced as he still needed Congressional support for his New Deal programmes, which were designed to bring the country out of the Depression.</span></p>

              <p style="margin-bottom: 0px; min-height: 1px;"><span>But still, Americans were not willing to risk their lives for peace abroad - even when war broke out in Europe in 1939.</span></p>
