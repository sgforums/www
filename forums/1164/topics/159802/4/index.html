            <div class='col-md body'>fr STimes 02.11.2005<br>Unveiled last Friday, the Singapore Artillery's Pegasus guns are its lightest<br>that fire its biggest shells. The gun was developed to answer a Singapore Army<br>demand in 1994 for a heli-portable 155mm gun. Nothing available made the cut,<br>so engineers designed one from scratch. David Boey reports<br><br>NO OTHER army in the world has a weapon like it - the world's first<br>heli-portable heavy artillery gun with its own engine.<br>Named Pegasus, after the immortal winged horse of Greek mythology, the<br>Singapore Artillery's new pride and joy was unveiled last Friday after years of<br>tests.<br>The concept is completely new.<br>The 5.4-tonne gun, which has a maximum 30km firing range, can be dropped on<br>the battle field by a CH-47 Chinook heavy-lift helicopter and immediately moved<br>into position at speeds of up to 12kmh using its mounted engine.<br>Its flimsy, no-frills appearance belies its ruggedness.<br>This gun has undergone some serious testing by its creators, the Defence<br>Science and Technology Agency (DSTA), weapons-maker Singapore Technologies<br>Kinetics and the Singapore Armed Forces (SAF).<br>Two prototypes of the Pegasus were driven across 800km of terrain, from the<br>dusty deserts in South Africa to the muddy tracks near Pasir Laba Camp here to<br>test its durability.<br>Close to 4,000 shells were fired during three years of live-firing trials in<br>Singapore and South Africa to test the gun's range, accuracy and reliability<br>The South Africa trials tested the engineers' endurance, too.<br>Temperatures there plunged to sub-zero during the winter, while tests at the<br>Safti live-firing area and in the South African desert were routinely conducted<br>in blazing 40 deg C heat.<br>Pegasus' uniqueness lies in its engine.<br>Some armies have 155mm guns that can be dropped into battle from<br>helicopters, but they cannot be moved from their landing site without tow<br>trucks.<br>Mr Kenneth Quek, the DSTA project manager who helped design Pegasus, said<br>the project started in 1994 after a worldwide search revealed that nothing met<br>the SAF's special requirements.<br>'We started designing the weapon from a clean sheet of paper,' Mr Quek said.<br>Though DSTA and its partners have amassed considerable experience in<br>designing artillery guns such as the 30km-range FH-88, the Pegasus design team<br>scored a first when it brought in aerospace engineers.<br>Mr Quek said the tripartite design team enlisted the help of Singapore<br>Technologies Aerospace engineers to find the best way to transport the gun and<br>its ammunition underneath a Chinook helicopter.<br>Mr Teo Chew Kwee, a vice-president for engineering at ST Kinetics, said: 'We<br>can't have things loosened midway during the flight or moving about on its own<br>- it might endanger the helicopter.'<br>Advice from aerospace engineers helped gun designers decide where to place<br>the lifting rings on the Pegasus, which attach the gun and its ammunition to<br>straps hung under the Chinook.<br>By last year, the design team was satisfied Pegasus could go into<br>production.<br>To save weight, the gun was stripped to its bare essentials, giving it a<br>distinctive, if unusual, appearance.<br>With a long barrel pointing forward, four wheels for mobility and a gunner<br>seated in the middle of the gun to steer the weapon, it looks a little like<br>someone riding a mechanical camel.<br>In fact, the camel nickname caught on and has stuck ever since.<br>Lance Corporal Abdul Hamid, 20, a full-time national service gunner with the<br>23rd Battalion Singapore Artillery, the first artillery unit equipped with<br>Pegasus, said: 'The gun looked funny to me when I saw it for the first time.<br>But I've a lot more confidence in the weapon after learning how to handle it,<br>and about its capabilities.'<br>Colonel Lim Chin, the Army's Chief of Artillery, believes his new gun is a<br>hit.<br>He said: 'I think the team of engineers has such a creative way of<br>overcoming the weight problem and mobility issues. It may not look very pretty,<br>but it serves its purpose.'end of quote</div>
