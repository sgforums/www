Not as in getting the first shot out, but in camouflaging the gun, i.e. the "action front" timing.

However, once it is deployed on the ground, it still requires a 5 or 7 ton to tow it away, or a Chinook to airlift it, since its SP status is quite limited.

'But nothing in existence or under development met our requirements.'<br><br>He said the joint project team finalised the gun's design last year, after extensive trials during which about 4,000 rounds were fired.<br><br>Many types of guns can fire shells 155mm in diameter. But fewer than a dozen are light enough to be transported by heavy-lifting helicopters, such as the CH-47 Chinook.<br><br>Pegasus beats them all as far as mobility is concerned because its gunners can drive the weapon to where it's needed after it is dropped by helicopter, rather than wait for a truck to be flown in to tow the gun around.<br><br>Pegasus has the same maximum range as the FH-88 heavy artillery gun, but at 5.4 tons, it is about 60 per cent lighter than the Singapore-made FH-88s.<br><br>Pegasus has almost twice the range of the older French-made LG1 105mm light gun which it will replace.<br><br>The new gun was unveiled yesterday.<br><br>The introduction of the Pegasus means all Singapore Artillery guns will use the same 155mm ammunition, making it easier to resupply artillery battalions during combat.<br><br>Defence Minister Teo Chee Hean unveiled the weapon by spray-painting the number-plate '5801' on the first Pegasus.<br><br>Mr Teo said: 'This weapon... can bring heavy firepower into the field and support the troops more quickly.<br><br>'It's got its own power unit, which gives it self-mobility in the field - something that other lightweight howitzers of this class do not have.'<br><br>Mr Christopher Foss, editor of the authoritative Jane's Armour &amp; Artillery yearbook, believes a weapon like Pegasus will interest other armies, especially those with rapid deployment forces.<br><br>The first Pegasus guns have been added to the arsenal of the 23rd Battalion Singapore Artillery.<br><br>Full-time national service gunners in the battalion are being trained to operate the weapon. They are due to conduct their first live-firing using Pegasus during Exercise Thunder Warrior, to be conducted in New Zealand in January.<br><br></div>

I consider counter-battery fire as the biggest problem with towed artillery (although those with APUs can offset some of the problems) in regards to displacement.<br></div></blockquote>Hahaha!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"> I was attached to arty units before; and my good fren was from arty...that's where I picked up some knowledge about them. You mentioned a good point - displacement time. I do agree that the APU may offset counter-battery fire to some extent...but how long does it take for a LWSPH gun crew to prepare for displacement? As compared to the Primus? It will still be slower...and we have to take terrain into consideration as well...the LWSPH can negotiate flat terrain like wat we saw in the training video, but wat if the deployment ground isn't as ideal?<br><br>Second factor..even if the gunners manage to displace in time, wat about the ammo and other supplies? This goes back to the issue of self-containment vs. self-propelled....a gun can be self-propelled, but not necessarily self-contained. On the other hand, a self-contained gun is usually self-propelled... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br><br>Dun get me wrong...I think the LWSPH is a good concept...but we have to be mindful of the tactical and strategic difficulties (to name a few..logistics come into play too) involved. Its like the classic problem of employing paratroopers...highly mobile, but nothing more than mere light infantry the moment they land.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"></div>
