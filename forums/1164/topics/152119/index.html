            <div class='col-md body'>Hi all, as we noe the RBS 70 is one of the Anti-Air weapons used by the RSAF's ADA.  Well, read from many websites that it is almost next to impossible to shake it off once the laser is locked onto it. Well, are there any methods to counter the treat from the RBS 70?<br><br>Since the RBS 70 Blk II, has a range of around 7km, does an aircraft that has been tracked and fired upon, once realising the missile launh,turn tail and pull a 180 before punching full afterburners and jetting out of range have a chance to escape from it?</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>if you can't break lock, next best thing to do is outrun it<br><br>most anti air missiles only have maximum maneuverability in the first few seconds of their flight, when the rocket motor is burning at maximum thrust. after that, the missile just rides on its momentum to the target.<br><br>by placing a missile on the aircraft's beam (that means the pilot puts the missile on his aircraft's 3/9 (o clock) line), it forces the missile to expend a lot of kinetic energy, as missiles engage in lead pursuit, meaning they fly to a point in front of the aircraft's flight path so that it will fly in a straight line to the aircraft's predicted point when the missile impacts.<br><br>the aircraft can also fly low, as the air is denser at lower altitudes, the missile's motor does not burn as efficiently as it would at higher altitudes.<br><br>as the missile is in the pilot's sights, he should execute a sharp 9G break turn into the missile, and if done at the right time, the missile should either break lock, or be unable to sustain the tighter G's it has to pull to maintain lead pursuit on the fighter, and will cause it to miss.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>the missile must very near for you to acquire it visually. the only time you know of a missile launch is during the initial launch.<br><br>so to break into the missile is not as simple as it is, you have to see it to manouevre against it, by the time its usually too late. its more of a last ditch manoevure<br><br>main thing is to stay away from the WEZ of the SAM sites. of if cannot. just plug your burners and run through as fast and as low so your crossing rate is too fast for the gunners to track and fire</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Okay, the RBS 70 is a laser guided, SAM.<br><br>A surveillance radar picks up the target, and the operator guides a laser beam for the missile.<br><br>Its not easy to defeat such a system, cos there will be no warnings give when the missile is launched.  The Radar Warning Recievers won't pick anything up other than the surveillance radar.  In otherwords the pilot wont know what hit him.<br><br>However, if the target is lucky, and knows that the missile was launched at him, and from which direction, his best chance would be diving for the deck.  The objective for hitting the deck is to break line of sight from the operator's designator, hence causing the missile to lose the beam.<br><br>If the higher the aircraft is from low altitudes, the more unlikely it is for the target to evade.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Well, quite agree that with what is being said so far about diving the jet and thus breaking the firer's line of sight and thus ability to track the jet with the missile. But is there no other way to like jam and confuse the missile?<br><br>I understand that for heatseekers like the Stinger,Mistral they can be defeated by Flares while radar-guided missiles like the I-Hawk and Patriot can be defeated by chaff, but is there any way at all to avoid laser tracking SAMs like the RBS 70?</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Not that I know of.  Most aircraft won't have a clue when they've been targetted by a laser.  Hence, they'd get shot without knowing what happened.<br><br>Besides, RBS 70 on fixed wing aircraft is kinda extreme I feel.  High speeds, and low altitudes make it a bitch for operators to track.  I feel its better off tracking helicopters.<br><br>Advantage of the RBS70 is that, u can use it against ground vehicles too! =D<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Ah, here is the problem with ADS such as the RBS70.  They are mobile.<br><br>They can be repositioned frequently to "outdate" enemy intelligence.  Even if u wack out their surveillance radars, there are probably spares to take over.  If well camouflaged, they can be very hard to spot, unless the target decides to turn on its radar.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>The Israelis have introduced a small anti-missile laser system for airliners.It involves a laser beam illuminating the incoming missile to fry the circuitry.<br><br><blockquote> Northrop, BAE Developing Laser-Based Systems<br>Analysts consider on-board jammers - known as directional infrared countermeasures or DIRCM - to be the most promising emerging military technology. The leading players in this field are Northrop, BAE and state-owned Israeli company, Rafael Armament Development Authority Ltd.<br><br>Given that airliners fly over densely populated areas, DIRCM systems have the safety advantage of being passive. Aviation authorities like the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration may be alarmed by the use of systems that eject flares to deflect missiles, say industry sources.<br><br>Both Northrop and BAE consider laser-based DIRCM systems    as an effective solution for airliners. Once an incoming infrared missile is detected by an onboard warning system, a laser-beam is directed onto the missile to jam its guidance systems.<br><br>Burt Keirstead, head of BAE Systems' Homeland Security Aircraft Defense initiative, likens the device to the trusted weapon of the Jedi Knights in the Star Wars movies: "It's like a light saber. You've got a beam coming out and it's basically deflecting it (the missile) of course," he says.<br><br>Keirstead believes missile protection systems will be fitted onto airliners over the next 5-10 years. "I think it's viable. Clearly the technology supports it," he says.<br><br>Earlier this year, Northrop Grumman's laser-based Nemesis DIRCM system was fitted onto some U.S. military aircraft like the Boeing C-17 transporter. The system is suitable for civil applications, says Northrop's Pledger.</blockquote></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Well, lets be really practical ahz...MANPADS will usually be deployed in groups, not just a single battery. Lets say they are deployed in groups of 5, that gives the firers 5 chances of hitting the target if each MANPAD of the RBS70 holds only one missile. And usually, the entire group will not fire at the same time, they will fire it at a staggered time period, once sighting the aircraft,so even if the aircrafts does have laser detection systems, will it be able to detect from which side is the missile streaking towards it? Although you may argue that firing a missile costs tens of thousands of dollars, well for say a single RBS70,it costs says SGD$50,000, 5 of those will cost a mere SGD$250,000. Imagine...SGD$250,000 to say trade with a USD$30mil. aircraft, its still worth it right? Though its difficult to track, the chances of hitting the aircraft is there.<br><br>Now lets talk about the deployment of MANPADS, I belief ADA will field a mixture of RBS 70 mounted on V200, Mistrals,Iglas, Rapier,I-Hawks and 35mm Oerlikon guns to maximize the hit probability.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Speaking of which.  There is this new Israeli Spyder AD system worth looking into.<br><br>I wont bother explaining.  U guys take a look for urself.  I think this one is quite deadly considering the python 5 has a 2hit probability.<br><br><a href="http://www.army-technology.com/projects/spyder/" rel="nofollow">http://www.army-technology.com/projects/spyder/</a></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Anyway,besides the RBS70 are there any systems which are laser guided as well?<br><br>Just to stary alittle, are ATGMs able to knock out aircrafts too?<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I believe it is possible to use ATGMs to knock out unsuspecting hovering helicopters.  For fixed wing aircraft... a bit hard.  ATGM tend to be a bit heavier and fly slower.</div>
