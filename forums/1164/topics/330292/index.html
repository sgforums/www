              <p>Given the sensitivity of the situation up north,if there were to be a repeat of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/May_13_Incident">May 13</a> riots of 1969, would you support Singapore taking punitive military action to stabilise the situation in Malaysia?</p>
              <p>It's very much in Singapore's national interest that our northern neighbour remain stable,but we must also bear in mind that both Indonesia and Malaysia have a history or persecuting their Chinese populations as well as being somewhat hostile to Singapore.</p>
              <p>It would be in our interest to ensure the protection of a part of a population that wields heavy economic influence on our neighbous,namely the Chinese communities, as well as a form of deterrence,to remind our neighbours of their military dispositions relative to us.</p>
              <p>Actions taken could be in the form of blockades or overflights of politically sensitive or vital military infrastructure,up to and including use of distance stand-off munitions such as cruise missiles,to hit vital or non-vital targets, as well as landing troops in Johore state for short intervals before withdrawal,as a show of strength.</p>
              <p>However,it could miscalculate and result in Malaysia and/or Indonesia being united against a common threat due to stirring up nationalism and so should be considered carefully.</p>
              <p>Despite this we should consider the use of low levels of military force to deter or harass either party involved.</p>

              <p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">Malaysia's military urges action against race troublemakers<br></span></span></strong>Posted: 11 September 2008 1753 hrs</p>
              <p><br>KUALA LUMPUR : <strong>Malaysia's armed forces chief Thursday called for "stern action" against those inciting racial conflict in the multicultural country, after the government warned tensions were rising. </strong></p>
              <p>A senior member of the ruling party was suspended for three years on Wednesday for triggering a race row with an outburst against ethnic Chinese, calling them "squatters" and warning them not to seek political power.</p>
              <p><strong>General Abdul Aziz Zainal, the military chief who earlier this week warned that racial issues were a "major threat to the country", again called for a lid to be put on any troublemakers. </strong></p>
              <p>"I only voice my concern on this issue, stern action must be taken to prevent it from happening," he told a press conference.</p>
              <p>"There is no country that wants to see itself in turmoil," he added.</p>
              <p>Prime Minister Abdullah Ahmad Badawi has raised concern about the state of ethnic relations in Malaysia, where the population is dominated by Muslim Malays who live alongside large ethnic Chinese and Indian communities.</p>
              <p>"The racial situation in our country looks like it is showing signs of strain and increasing tensions among races," he said as he announced the measures to punish errant ruling party member Ahmad Ismail.</p>
              <p>"We for so long have been able to control the situation so that nothing untoward happens, but we can't allow a situation like this to continue... which could affect our peace and stability," he said.</p>
              <p>Deputy police chief Ismail Omar also sounded a warning on Wednesday, saying that racially charged statements had triggered a dangerous rash of inflammatory messages on Internet blogs and SMS text messages.</p>
              <p>"I am issuing a stern warning to all quarters to refrain from making statements on sensitive issues via the various media," he said, according to the state Bernama news agency.</p>
              <p>Ahmad's comments had raised fears of a split in Abdullah's coalition of race-based parties, which includes ethnic Chinese parties that were infuriated by the diatribe.</p>
              <p>"The patience of the Malays and Muslims has a limit. Do not push us to the wall, as when we turn back we will be forced to push the Chinese in the interests of our own survival," Ahmad said in a press conference Monday.</p>
              <p>"The Chinese should not try to be like the Jews in America -- it is not enough they control the economy, now they want political control," he said.</p>
              <p>Malays dominate politics in Malaysia, while ethnic Chinese are prominent in business. Stirring up conflict between the groups is a serious offence in a country which is still haunted by past racial violence.</p>
              <p>The latest row erupted as opposition leader Anwar Ibrahim -- whose Keadilan party is the first pan-racial party in Malaysian political history -- attempts to woo the support of enough coalition lawmakers to topple the government.</p>
              <p>In March elections the opposition dramatically increased the number of seats it holds, and Anwar this week said he is "on track" to sign up the 30 defectors he needs to seize power.</p>

              <p>such an intervention might prove to be rather un-diplomatic lar.</p>
              <p>we are not russia yet. (perhaps no link lar)</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>anws, i think such action should only be taken, (blantant intervention) only if the situation gets really out of hand.. i.e. they threaten to invade us or smth....</p>
              <p>however, if we do that when there is no threat against us, we would be come the aggressor, and rage would be broadened from just the m-chiniese to singapore too. by then, the ties would be broken irreparably liao.</p>

              <p>its about as likley as alaska going back to russia and georgia saying they are regretful for attacking south ossentia and willingly go back to the soviet union.</p>
              <p>ASEAN is a loose diplomatic framework that functions as a pressure/tension release valve for the many fault lines across countries within this region.</p>
              <p>ASEAN does not condone violence against member countries. if you do know a wee bit about history, go think about asean's response to the vietnamese invasion of cambodia.</p>
              <p>the only precedent for SAF to go in and conduct any "rescue" op, was in cambodia. 1997</p>
              <p>http://www.mindef.gov.sg/imindef/about_us/history/maturing_saf/v04n07_history.html</p>
              <p>and this is different in the sense that there was extreme political instability that there was in effect, no body of government/organisation holding executive power. you can put it that there was no government, so no problem for SAF to go in and conduct the rescue op. SAF rescue op also had no permission to land at cambodia's airport but they did it anyway. that was the state of anarchy then.</p>
              <p>read here to find out more : http://hrw.org/english/docs/2007/07/27/cambod16551.htm</p>
              <p>in malaysia's case, no matter what extent the instability is, there is a near likelyhood of 0 that the malaysian army or elements of it would attempt to stage a coup. even if the ruling faction was deposed or removed in any form, there is the opposition , which in their capacity as elected legislative officials, can constitute a government. hence i see no possibility that RSAF/SAF would even attempt anything like that as there is no justifiable legal basis for them to take extreme measures. usually hiding in the country's embassy is safe enough.</p>
              <p>simply put, the SAF could conduct an evacuation in cambodia as no one could be called the government and the de facto power parties were engaged in a bloody coup to be paying enough attention to shoot our c130s down.</p>
              <p>just take the 80s, the thai junta. there was a lot of bloodshed during the junta's attempt to maintain rule but there was no evacuation of the singaporean people there.</p>
              <p>singapore cannot act so as long as there is any form of government that could protest its unsolicited presence there.  cambodia was an exceptional set of circumstances. no possiblity of that even occuring remotely in malaysia.</p>
              <p>in malaysia, even if something goes wrong and all hell breaks loose, and u end up without the government or opposition,  you still have the sultans. the king/sultans hold office in the form of being able to choose the judiciary and if all executive branches of the government fail, the onus is on them to take leadership or impose some form of leadership. they also are titular heads of the malaysian military AFAIK.</p>

              <p>Thank you for the feedback.

              <p>and isnt malaysia a "small nation" as well if you examine it in terms of population demographics ?</p>
              <p>no issues here, but if you grasp the gist of what i m trying to say, is the likelihood of intervention is next to nothing. i quoted vietnam because its the exact Outcome we would want to avoid as a nation state, becoming a pariah, if we choose to intervene. in singaporean eyes it might be seen as humanitarian or helping our people, but in the eyes of the world, what would the opinion be ? it would be percieved as unilateral cowboy action. i m sure you can think of other more recent precedents.</p>
              <p>Burma is a case in point. no matter what they do within internal borders, ASEAN cannot intervene in physical terms. the onus is on each country to sort its issues within by themselves, and sort the regional and bigger geopolitical issues through ASEAN.</p>
              <p>Whats your bit about "calculated risks from a position of strength" ? mind elaborating more ?  if we were to pull off any unilateral military action, it isnt going to be a benign show of strength/act of goodwill, it will only increase tension and animosity.</p>
              <p>IMHO , its just the politicians politicking. remember the mahatir days ? the good ole thunder and lightning but nothing much really.</p>
              <p>The litmus test for trouble would be to watch for demonstrations/street protests. when u have a mob, that is when problem really starts. within a mob, chances are, people are far more easily manipulated and far less concerned about social cohesion or the consequences of their action. in a mob, there is no decisive control over the group's action. this is when there is no restraint and chances of a all out racial conflict would escalate sharply. for a good example, look at hinraf ?</p>
              <p>frankly i think its simply media sensationalism. i was more worried when they banned anwar's supporters from organizing a mass rally in putrajaya /march to the PM's office. that would have been NASTY if the police brutally supressed it.</p>

              <p>foriegn military intervention will be unwlecomed, malaysia, unlike burma has a civil society and they have shown that they can weaken the govt in the march ge....badawi is probably a nice man but clearly ineffectual...mahatir is likely the only one who can put down the chaos but few non-malays would want him back, this man is clearly a racist...</p>
              <p>for sg to even intervene on behalf of the chinese there would be suicidal, you can already see what nationalism can do....saddam was probably the biggest sob around but iraq isn't making a pleasant stay for the americans....</p>
              <p>with burma, foriegn military might be a welcome sight to the ordinary folks but who would want to risk fighting huge number of soldiers, even if they are ill equipped...</p>

              <p>Finally, we can call up the other ASEAN countries to sit down and tell Malaysia that we are concerned. This is their internal affairs and we are in no position to launch punitive attack.

              <p>Thank you for the feedback. But let's face it,ASEAN is quite ineffective in reigning in its members.Just look at Burma.Its an embarassment to ASEAN and on the world stage showed how bloody ineffective it is as an organisation. It has ensured stability in the past but in times of crisis requiring action?</p>
              <p>And my original question was <em>would you support punitive military actions?</em>Personally I would but what is <strong><em>your</em></strong> opinion?This is a <em>potential</em> crisis,so its just speculation,but still,the way they play race politics is not something to take lightly.</p>
              <p>For diplomacy with other large organisations it gives us leverage but when it comes to intra-ASEAN diplomacy it would be better to take calculated risks from a position of strength when dealing with Malaysia and Indonesia.</p>
              <p>As for Cambodia,while there was a general isolation of Vietnam (which suffered from <a rel="nofollow" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sino-Vietnamese_War">punitive military actiob by China in 1979</a> during that time),there was increased aid to Thailand for its military and refugees as a result,as well as rumoured unofficial presence of some of our troops there. We took a role in diplomatically isolating Vietnam and sanctioning them,because it was in our interest then to do so and look after the sovereignity of small nations.</p>

              <p>Its not so simple u have PRC as a influential player in the region now,  and the elements of communist is no longer view as a threat, </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>ASEAN lack resolve to solve regional problems it would prefer to let things evolve and keep the grouping as lay back entity. Maybe that is the inheritant culture. </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>If chinese kept getting beat up situation got worst and never address the root problems of racial tension but just burried the suspisicion. You will see PRC propaganda intervene. So at the end of the day Singapore wil be better off neutral and project as a more western and educated states that give a sense of equalities. </p>
              <p><br>Well u know what amazed me is that the Social geopolitics in Sg n MY have not changed after 40 yrs of independent. especially we had the 2nd n 3rd generation growing up in the region post independent.  </p>
