The new and improved design also offers<strong> a collapsible roll cage frame that readily allows two vehicles to be stacked for rapid air deployment</strong>, enhancing the efficiency of air transportability by allowing more LSVs to be transported in a single go. With this feature, it is now possible to accommodate six Spiders comfortably in a C130 aircraft.<br><br>Mobile<br>With a new 130-hp engine, ST Kinetics' Spider moves faster and performs better in a variety of terrain conditions. It is designed for unmatched performance in off-road conditions such as mountainous, cross-country or desert terrain. The Spider LSV has a four-wheel drive design with improved, independent suspensions for better shock absorption and crew comfort. It scales inclines of up to 60%, traverse side slopes of up to 50% and<strong>manoeuvre through dense vegetation with ease.</strong>Its low centre of gravity and top speed of 120 km/h makes it ideal in providing close fire support for infantry troops and special operations forces. As an added advantage, the Spider's environmentally friendly engine is certified up to Euro III emission standard.<br><br>Deployable<br>ST Kinetics' Spider has a light weight space frame that greatly improves its air portability.<strong>Its patented space frame allows for the vehicle to be internally carried by transport aircraft, while its versatile layout allows for a crew configuration that can accommodate up to 6 men. Its centre-drive design translates into more efficient utilisation of space and manpower on board</strong>compared to conventional left or right hand drive models. Coupled with commonality in its "family of vehicles" concept, the Spider is an ideal basic building block for an air mechanized force of the future.<br><br><strong>Multi role platform<br>ST Kinetics' Spider LSV offers a high payload to accommodate a wide range of weapon systems from heavy machine guns, grenade launchers and canons, to mini UAVs, sensor and surveillance systems. Its configurable roll cage system enables easy modification of the vehicle to suit a variety of missions that include attack, surveillance, reconnaissance, ambulance, emergency and combat support roles. Its "family of vehicles" concept enables commonality of parts for optimised logistics and maintenance support.<br><br>Crew safety and protection<br>For added safety, the Spider LSV is fitted with power-assisted brakes for better control over off-road terrain. It is built with a removable windscreen for protection against the elements of weather. As an added advantage, the Spider can also be easily fitted with capsulised armour for protection against small arms of up to 7.62mm.<br><br>Aside from a conventional power source, the Spider can also be fitted with a Motor Generator (MOGEN), a hybrid electric and motor unit. When operated on its electrical power, the MOGEN enables a vehicle to move in the silent (stealthy) mode</strong>thereby increasing the survivability of its crew operating in the frontline. The MOGEN can also provide back-up power as an auxillary power source.<br><br>Future developments<br>Future Spider LSV designs will incorporate a patent-pending retractable wheel system. In operations, this offers the Spider a lower centre of gravity for better stability and manoeuvrability at high speeds in off-road conditions. With the wheels fully retracted, the Spider takes on a more streamlined profile that allows it to be internally transported in narrow-body carriers such as the V22 Osprey aircraft.<br><br>It can also be readily configured for unmanned operations as an effort to protect troops who need to perform surveillance roles in the battlefront.</blockquote>fr <a href="http://www.stengg.com/CoyCapPro/detail.aspx?pdid=127" rel="nofollow">http://www.stengg.com/CoyCapPro/detail.aspx?pdid=127</a><br><br><img src="http://i9.photobucket.com/albums/a90/puzzylion/spider.bmp"><br>Can be easily fitted with Capsulised armour  for protection against small arms up to 7.62mm.
