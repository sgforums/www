            <div class='col-md body'>Soldiers are trained to fight.  Fighting require aggression.  So how to instill the aggressive spirit? In SAF, I do not see much structured attempts to instill this vital spirit in the average conscript soldier, besides the few bayonent fighting sessions in BMT and unarmed combat sessions.<br><br>Have we gone overboard with TSR?  I believe no CO, commanders or PTI would like to answer to a BOI for fatalities suffered during training.  I do not want that on my conscience as well.

I know there have been some cases of fatal collapse in SAF but how else to maintain the fitness level that underpin aggression if you don't push the endurance of the soldier.  Maybe, DSO should developed a personal bio-sign monitor for each soldiers.  Monitor the vital bios of soldiers when they undertake strenuous tasks/exercises.

            <div class='col-md body'>i beg to differ, sometimes a non thinking 'yes sir' soldier who only know to spit bullet and create destruction...become very usefull in war. war is not about push button and point and click ma...its about fear...fearing a standoff weapon is one thin g...fear of being decapitated by a psyco soldier is a huge bonus.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Nah I disagree... it's good to have a soldier that can shoot well and not question orders when it comes to it, but at the end of the day it depends on what kind of balance you strike up. The soldier should not be the kind that questions each and every order but also not the kind to carry out bad orders that would spell disaster just because he was told to do so. I don't see any use for arguing for either extreme (ie. totally independent, thinking soldiers or totally obedient soldiers), it's a matter of balance.<br><br>If you read Generation Kill, there are several instances in the Yank army where NCOs stood up to Commissioned ranks because the officers were making bad decisions, or even instances where they defied their superiors. But they always acted in the best interests of their men, and as it turned out they made the right decision. What we need is an army that holds all ranks accountable to each other, and not just "this is what you are told, go do it."<br><br>I would certainly trust myself more if the dudes beside me were a lot smarter then if they simply followed all orders without question. Creativity in the battlefield is a great asset, and a grunt that can get the mission done without too much micromanagement from his NCO and commissioned ranks is certainly a very useful thing to have.</div>
