            <div class='col-md body'>SAF retires Fennec helicopter fleet<br>French-built choppers phased out to make way for more advanced Apache attack helicopters<br><br>By David Boey<br><br>THE Republic of Singapore Air Force (RSAF) has retired its fleet of 20 Fennec light helicopters as it reshapes its fleet to receive more advanced Apache attack choppers.<br><br>The Defence Ministry told The Straits Times that the 13-year-old Fennecs have been 'withdrawn from service' and are looking for new owners.<br><br>Advertisement<br><br>One could be the Royal New Zealand Air Force, which sent a team here in late January to check out the Fennecs with a view to buying several of the French-made choppers.<br><br>Captain John Tucker, defence adviser at the New Zealand High Commission in Singapore, said a decision on the Fennecs should come 'within the next few weeks'.<br><br>The Eurocopter Fennec helicopters, named after a small fox-like creature found in Africa, were introduced in 1991. The RSAF bought two types and 10 of each type served with two squadrons based at Sembawang Air Base.<br><br>One model is the AS.550A2 light observation helicopter, which was used to train new helicopter pilots. During operations, this Fennec can be armed with a 20mm gun and 70mm rockets, and flown as an aerial scout.<br><br>The other was the AS.550C2 light attack helicopter. More powerfully armed than the A2 model, this version can carry up to four TOW-2B wire-guided anti-tank missiles.<br><br>New Zealand may buy a mix of A2 and C2 Fennecs as replacements for its ageing Bell 47 Sioux helicopters, which it uses for pilot training, said Capt Tucker.<br><br>The firepower of the single-engine Fennecs pales in comparison with the arsenal that the twin-engine United States-made Boeing Apaches take into battle, giving the Singapore Armed Forces more punch.<br><br>The RSAF has reshaped its helicopter fleet in recent years as more powerful and more capable choppers, such as the Boeing CH-47SD Chinook, enter service.<br><br>Dozens of pilots and ground crew selected to train on Apaches have also gone to the US for training.<br><br>Modernisation of the RSAF helicopter fleet has left the air force with many surplus helicopters that are still in good condition.<br><br>The Fennecs' retirement follows the withdrawal of 20 Bell UH-1H Hueys, which were refurbished by Singapore Technologies Aerospace and sold to the Philippine Air Force for US$12 million (S$20.2 million).<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>my source told me that there are no plans to close 124sqn, most likely the fennecs the nz wants are those in storage. there are 19 fennecs and 124 got 10 in operations. dun ask me which 10 of those are a2 and which are c2. anyway the whole article is wrong. if you go to sbab today, the fennecs are still flying and next month there is a pk detachment. 123 was closed down with the arrival of ah-64.</div>

If we can give it a good roof mounted sight for night observation and armed it with Hellfire II or Spike, then it will be a real force multiplier, backing up the Apaches.  I do think that the ground force will never have enuff helos to call for air strikes and an armed Fennec with rockets and 20mm cannon will be a welcome sight, blasting away any soft skinned vehicles, bunkers, and enemy troops concentration area.</div>

Could the RSAF be switching to the EC-120/135 and selling off the Fennec.  Anyway, we can always produce a lot of EC-120/135 by ourselves for our own needs should it arise, to fit LOH, LAH, COIN roles?<br></div>
