The F-15SG was chosen on 6 September 2005 over the only remaining aircraft still in contention, the Dassault Rafale.<br><br>The F-15SG is similar in configuration to the F-15K sold and being delivered to South Korea, but differs in the addition of the APG-63(V)3 active electronically scanned array radar developed by Raytheon. Pending news on Lockheed MartinÂ’s F-35's progress, the RSAF has placed an order of 12 aircraft with an option for 8 more to replace its A-4SUs. The purchase is part of the New Fighter Replacement Program, worth about US$1 billion and which will be the most expensive single fighter aircraft purchase by the RSAF.<br><br>On 22 August 2005, the US Defense Security Cooperation Agency (DSCA) notified US Congress about a potential Foreign military sales (FMS) of weapons, logistics and training in the event that the Boeing F-15 was selected by Singapore. Since the F-15 purchase has now been confirmed, it can be assumed that Singapore will follow up on this proposed weapons and logistics package, worth a further US$741 million dollars if all options are exercised.<br><br>Weapons in this package include:<br><br>* 200 AIM-120C Advanced Medium Range Air-to-Air Missiles (AMRAAM)<br>* 6 AMRAAM Captive Air Training (CAT) Missiles<br>* 50 MK-82 GBU-38 Joint Direct Attack Munitions (JDAM) w/BLU-111 warhead<br>* 44 AN/AVS-9(V) Night Vision Goggles<br>* 24 Link 16 Multifunctional Information Distribution System/Low Volume Terminals (Fighter Data Link Terminals)<br>* 30 AGM-154A-1 (JSOW) Joint Standoff Weapons with BLU-11 warheads<br>* 30 AGM-154C (JSOW) Joint Standoff Weapons<br>* 200 AIM-9X SIDEWINDER Missiles<br>* 24 AIM-9X SIDEWINDER CAT and Dummy Missiles<br><br><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/F-15SG" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/F-15SG</a></div>

The F-15SG was chosen on 6 September 2005 over the only remaining aircraft still in contention, the Dassault Rafale.<br><br>The F-15SG is similar in configuration to the F-15K sold and being delivered to South Korea, but differs in the addition of the APG-63(V)3 active electronically scanned array radar developed by Raytheon. Pending news on Lockheed MartinÂ’s F-35's progress, the RSAF has placed an order of 12 aircraft with an option for 8 more to replace its A-4SUs. The purchase is part of the New Fighter Replacement Program, worth about US$1 billion and which will be the most expensive single fighter aircraft purchase by the RSAF.<br><br>On 22 August 2005, the US Defense Security Cooperation Agency (DSCA) notified US Congress about a potential Foreign military sales (FMS) of weapons, logistics and training in the event that the Boeing F-15 was selected by Singapore. Since the F-15 purchase has now been confirmed, it can be assumed that Singapore will follow up on this proposed weapons and logistics package, worth a further US$741 million dollars if all options are exercised.<br><br>Weapons in this package include:<br><br>* 200 AIM-120C Advanced Medium Range Air-to-Air Missiles (AMRAAM)<br>* 6 AMRAAM Captive Air Training (CAT) Missiles<br>* 50 MK-82 GBU-38 Joint Direct Attack Munitions (JDAM) w/BLU-111 warhead<br>* 44 AN/AVS-9(V) Night Vision Goggles<br>* 24 Link 16 Multifunctional Information Distribution System/Low Volume Terminals (Fighter Data Link Terminals)<br>* 30 AGM-154A-1 (JSOW) Joint Standoff Weapons with BLU-11 warheads<br>* 30 AGM-154C (JSOW) Joint Standoff Weapons<br>* 200 AIM-9X SIDEWINDER Missiles<br>* 24 AIM-9X SIDEWINDER CAT and Dummy Missiles<br><br><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/F-15SG" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/F-15SG</a></div></blockquote>According to Wikipedia its US$1 billion.  That's A LOT more than S$1 billion.  Also, the proposed weapons and logistics package are said to be worth a further US$741 million.</div>
