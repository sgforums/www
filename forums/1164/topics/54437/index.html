            <div class='col-md body'>hmmm... can't help but notice that ST is made to sound like a "merchant of death" exploiting global uncertainties to make a quick buck... sure, grudging acknowledgement is made of ST's technological achievements, but u just can't help but notice that the article is not exactly flattering...<br><br><strong>Call to arms in Singapore yields explosive results</strong><br>Age, Melbourne<br>August 8, 2003<br><br>A REGIONALweapons manufacturer is establishing itself as a global competitor.<br>Another bombing in Jakarta, an attempted coup in the Philippines, the war on terror, the war against Saddam Hussein, Islamic separatists in north-western China, Peru's Shining Path resurfacing, Chechnya, Liberia, the Solomon Islands, the West Bank and Gaza. These are good times for arms manufacturers.<br><br>And right in our region there is a company that is making a bid to be an important international player in weapons production and sales. Its name is Singapore Technologies Engineering, a company that is listed in Singapore and ultimately controlled by the Singapore Government. The company aims to do more than simply supply Singapore's armed forces. It is touting for big export sales.<br><br>ST Engineering has four divisions that are involved in military research and hardware manufacturing: ST Kinetics, ST Aerospace, ST Marine and ST Electronics.<br><br>ST Kinetics is the key military hardware division and has almost 3000 employees. It can provide field air-defence mounts, advanced mortar systems, remote weapon stations, automatic grenade-launchers, machine-guns, assault rifles howitzers and munitions, all of which are made in Singapore.<br><br>ST Kinetics has also developed the Terrex AV81, an eight-wheeled light armoured vehicle. The company signed a memorandum of understanding last year with the Turkish automotive manufacturer Otokar to jointly develop an 8x8 vehicle based on the Terrex AV81 prototype to bid for a supply contract with the Turkish Army.<br><br>It has also developed the Bionix Infantry Carrier Vehicle, which has been sold to the US Army.<br><br>But it's the SAR-21 automatic rifle that is ST Kinetics's premier product. First came the SAR-80 and the SAR-88 rifles. There's also the Ultimax 100, a gas-operated, rotating-bolt machine-gun, produced in Singapore since 1982. All three have been sold abroad. Sales of the SAR-80, for example, were made to South Africa.<br><br>However, most development has gone on the SAR-21. Several variants of the SAR-21 have been produced for export. In the US, these weapons are distributed via ST Engineering's subsidiary, VT Systems.<br><br>ST Kinetics is a regular exhibitor at international arms fairs and the company is expanding its offshore presence too, with agreements and equity stakes with other defence contractors, including Britain's Vickers Defence Systems and Canada's Silvatech Group. It also has a development agreement with Australia's Innovonics for the installation of fleet management and vehicle-monitoring systems for its Bronco all-terrain vehicles.<br><br>ST Kinetics's sister company ST Aerospace is a global player in upgrading and maintaining military and commercial aircraft. It provides upgrades to the world's air forces for fighter, transport and rotary-wing military aircraft. Recent clients have included the Turkish air force, the Brazilian air force and the Singapore air force. The US Navy is another long-term client.<br><br>ST Marine supplies the Singapore navy with small vessels and it, too, is keen to win export contracts with foreign navies. Its capabilities also include ship repair and ship conversion.<br><br>ST Electronics has a subsidiary, ST Training &amp; Simulation, that exports flight-mission trainers for pilot training. Also on offer are armour gunnery and tactical simulators.<br><br>There's more to Singapore than shopping, business conventions and a ban on chewing gum.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Well, whoever the client is....the bionix has indeed been sold to some nations. The ozzie paper that reported this is no fly-by-night operation, perhaps, only perhaps, it's refering to another STE contract with the US army(albeit much smaller and lower profile) other than the failed tender? If you recall STE's aggressive marketing and subsequent failed bid back then was widely publicised in the business world so i would give this report a benefit of doubt.<br><br>Below is an excerpt from the opening of the article on STE at the online Fortune Magazine<br><br><span style="color: red;">"ST Battles to Prove Its Worth<br>Is it time for one of the region's largest entities to be broken up?<br>FORTUNE<br>Thursday, February 6, 2003<br>By Eric Ellis<br><br>War is an indelible part of Singapore Technologies CEO Peter Seah's work. It sits right there on his office table, in the form of a model of the Bionix infantry fighting vehicle that ST manufactures. At full size, it's 17 tons of steel and firepower. "We are very proud of it," says Seah, citing strong sales to "friendly nations" that he's too coy to name. "</span><br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Actually the LAV III is not a bad vehicle. I've sat in it a couple of times before. It's spacious inside for Asians, but for ang-moh, its just nice, after adding in the bulkiness of web gear and so on...<br><br>It's also pretty agile and fast. Plus there's an onboard TV screen hooked up to a camera on the turret. It gives the infantry section a forward view of their surroundings before they dismount. This is the most useful tool I've come across, since it gives the section commander time to organize his men....The comms system is pretty much the same as those found in S'pore's AFVs...typically a lever-type junction box to switch between group frequencies and main frequency...<br><br>The only thing abt that vehicle is that the vehicle ground clearance is pretty high...so when the ramp door comes down and you dismount, it's like running down a mini steep slope... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Actually I am not exactly surprised, or distressed when I realize that our weapons are being used for causes that we certainly dun agree with.<br><br>I dun think we actively support or even condone their regimes, as a matter of fact, may even be opposed to them.<br><br>They are not getting their weapons directly from us, but from second or third hand dealers. Which we have little control over, it's an open market out there.<br><br>Our only fault is that our weapons are good enough to meet their needs, giving them the much needed bang for buck.

            <div class='col-md body'>There is a good reason why Singapore would be reluctant to sell arms directly towards unsavoury sources. Given the recent terror threat, there is a good chance that if we do not herald our arms carefully, they may end up being used against us. Imagine if an Ambrust ST sold to JI undertable ended up popping a minister's car... I don't think it's exactly in our interest, internationally or economically to hark a few million bucks work of stuff to tiny factions that are peanuts compared to offical deals. The potential backlash is just not worth it.<br><br>At the same time however, being pragmatic, ST might be inclined to sell stuff towards shady sources by closing one or two eyes, and asking only the bare minimum questions and getting the paperwork right. Beyond that, ST wun pass up a chance to make a quick buck if they can do so legally, even if it is morally questionable because we have no idea where our arms might end up, as long as it does not bring us trouble.<br><br></div>

Anyone can simply type 'unicorn international and myanmar' in google and can come to their own conclusions based on the results...Singapore will do business with any govt it deems to be 'legitimate' no matter how thuggish - as long as there's no UN embargo/sanctions. Even Jane's Intel Review (Mar 9<img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"> confirms a singapore-myanmar connection. UI has been burnt before in the bofors arms scandal in the 80s for exporting arms to iran during the persian gulf war. So it will make sure not to repeat the same mistake<br><br>Perhaps it's a different matter when it comes to bloodthirsty warlords with their own private militia - who don't qualify as a govt institution. So this is probably where middleman comes in<br><br></div>
