Let's say we build a tank that is so tough that the armour cannot be penetrated by a 120 round, the impact may not damage the tank, but I don't think the crew can get off as lightly.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>That's interesting. First time I've seen M1s being damaged/hit, the latest pics showing a disabled M1. I can only suspect an ambush situation.  Can this sort of thing happen using an RPG from a range of 50+ meters on an M1?<br><br>Even I haven't seen the Israeli's being hit like these and shown on CNN/BBC. Tactical/doctrinal differences between the two armies?</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Come on, the M1 was only known to be indestructable along the FRONT.  The sides and rear are still vulnerable.  What the M1 really boasted was crew survivability.  Ammo Explosions on the M1 is rare... thats why u don't see the whole turret fly off in the event of a catastrophic hit.  Anyway, I guess the crewmember was injured by some unsecured item lying around in his turret when they took a hit.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>RPG under 50m probably won't scratch the ABRAMs along the front, side also quite unlikely.  Rear would be quite deadly, knocking out its gas turbine engine which is located there.  What i suspect really got that Abrams could have been a really well hidden AT-mine or similar explosive device that was detonated at really close proximity.</div>
