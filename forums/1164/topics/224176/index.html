The carrier was not under wartime procedures and in peacetime the carrier couldn't have done anything to prevent the submarine from doing so.

            <div class='col-md body'>I attribute it to hubris on both sides. When you go to the stragetypage forums you are obviously going to get a lot of pro American opinion just as you would get if you went to sinodefence. It's a nationalistic thing you get anywhere when you put enough like-minded people together, very often more words spoken are nationalistic proclamations then actual analysis and discussion. I don't think even the Americans are above this kind of behaviour. But it can be a tad amusing watching some people argue why the Type 99 is superior to the M1 Abrams BOTH in quality and cost, and what have you not. There is a lot of stuff that people would like to believe, because reality is a lot grittier and often more boring.<br><br>But realistically speaking, it is obvious that the PLAN is unable to take on the USN force on force or in a pitched naval battle. However, I think it's a tad quick to say that they are totally incapable of dealing any damage to a USN CBG. And that is going to be a big issue for the Americans esp. when the Chinese do not mind trading 10 or 20 ships or sub for one carrier. AFAIK, the USN has no engaged any enemy navy in a major engagement since WW2, hence it's really a crapshoot on what exactly is going to happen. But it bides everyone well not to underestimate your opponent. It is also important to note that the PLAN is in the process of improvement and hence future projections will be far murkier. Maybe they will squander their chance and maybe not- but that's really for the future. Of course most Americans would LIKE to think of the PLAN or PLA as incapableÂ… but I think that's mostly nationalistic speak better for politicians and not soldiers.<br><br>But I don't think the average American soldier is no slouch at fighting though- and I think it's not fair to hold them to such unrealistic and often hypocritical standardsÂ… and maybe it stems from a complex that wants to debunk this myth that they are invincible- but as any rational person already knowsÂ… they are still human. I don't see the need to put them as lousy fighters- objectively speaking they can fight, and often they do it pretty well.<br><br>Their greater weaknesses lie in the way the American soldier is so tightly bound to the politician's apron strings, and I think policies and politics often hurt the US Army more then enemy bullets. By all accounts they acquitted themselves satisfactorily (combat wise) in Somalia (could we really do better with an entire city out to kill a battalion sized force?) and it the mission was killed by public and politics as opposed to incompetence. In Vietnam they managed to win every major ground battle, not to mention the Tet offensive in which they inflicted a crushing defeat on the NVA (though eventually the Tet offensive turned out to be a strategic victory thanks to public opinion).<br><br>Even more recently in Fallujah the USMC was on the verge of routing the insurgents in the first battle but was called back on the brink of victory for diplomacy. After much wrangling the second battle was finally fought to finish the job which the first battle should have accomplished (with much less losses and damage as well). I think the primary weakness of the US military is the way it is highly entrenched to the whim and wane of politics (as opposed to letting the grunt's work decide what really needs to be done), and inevitably so. It is a different kind of war nowadays.<br><br>I wouldn't make the mistake of belittling the average US Infantryman, as captured insurgents often express surprise at the marksmanship, tactics, and aggressiveness of the US soldier in battle, when they have been told that the American cannot fight in a stand up battle and is dependent on technology. I think the American soldier is a gung-ho, ethnocentric and ignorant personality that rubs us the wrong way at times, but I hardly think when push comes to shove they are full of hot air. They can fight, and do it rather well to mention.<br><br>But the best infantrymen (as in no CAS and all that support, just plain old grunt fighting?) in the world? I think it could be the Aussies or Brits... maybe the Gurkas as well.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>The myth that US Army is often held back by politicians or general public is just so much hogwash. The aggressive politicians are sending US troops all over the world to fight as we speak.<br><br>The only thing they are held back from is from overly wanton use of firepower that are killing too many civilians and achieving too little results.<br><br>In both Korea and Vietnam the US airforce was prevented from flattening enemy cities WW-2 style or using atomic weapons. As not only will it kill a lot of civilians, it would have been a clear sign of desperation at being unable to defeat a peasant nation.<br><br>Public opinion?<br><br>That's another excuse we often make for the Americans.<br><br>If they are WINNING A WAR, trust me, there would be no public raising any opinion against the war. Only when clearly they are not winning, like in Iraq, then will Americans start to have a public opinion against the war. If they are winning, no one would ask them to stop.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by moca:</div><div class="quote_body">The only thing they are held back from is from overly wanton use of firepower that are killing too many civilians and achieving too little results.<br><br>If they are WINNING A WAR, trust me, there would be no public raising any opinion against the war. Only when clearly they are not winning, like in Iraq, then will Americans start to have a public opinion against the war. If they are winning, no one would ask them to stop.</div></blockquote>I beg to differ, if you want to look at wonton use of firepower and killing too many civillians with little results... look at Gronzy.<br><br>And I also need to wonder if we really have any other wars fought by other armed forces to compare this with. Would the PLA do better if they decided to "liberate" Taipei? Wonton use of firepower? Is the USMC sniper and GBU units a less discriminating weapon in rooting out insurgents then blanket soviet arty? You have been doped up too much on the media without considering what the grunts on the ground actually say of their experience my friend.<br><br>And politics being hogwash? Your statements on Vietnam and Korea make we wonder if you have even read into the situtation beyond riding on the common tagline of "being unable to defeat a peasant nation". Vietnam especially when the Tet Offensive was a crippling disaster for the NVA, but yet ultimately a war winner out of the hands of the grunts. I suggest you reread how Vietnam was really lost, and why Korea was the way it is now.<br><br>Case in point, the first battle of Fallujah (the fierest fighting in Iraq so far) was nearly won before it was stopped on rationale that the damage done was too great. In that first battle 150 airstikes were launched and 75 to 100 buildings destroyed. However when the doomed Fallujah brigade was finally disbanded seven months later after much political wrangling and it was realized that stopping the battle had allowed the insurgency to gain strength the second battle was launched.<br><br>This time there were 540 air strikes, 14,000 artillery and mortar shells fired, as well as 2500 M1 rounds. 18,000 of Fallujah's 39,000 buildings were level or destroyed and the insurgency crushed in the city. Unfortunately the second battle came at a far higher cost in lives and damage as the USMC was not allowed to finish a job they could have easily acomplished (they were within hours of routing the insurgency in Fallujah during April) had they been allowed to finish the fight. Instead the board was set which allowed a fiercer, and more costy battle.<br><br>Your views on the Iraq war are simplistic Moca, and I would like to believe that the average American soldier is as silly as you like to make it out to be. But the truth is they are also human and subject to error and heroism entertaining  statements that in general they are not a competent bunch as soldiers go.<br><br>I'm afraid as the previous posts from other poster have also indicated... the hogwash's on you.<br><br><blockquote>I remember that Clancy had one of these hell scenarios where basically Iran tied up with China or Korea? or India (fictional , ok) to open up multiple fronts so that US gets distracted and they can get the actual objectives without having to show their hand till the last minute. Of course it is not so easy in real life (what with mono-dimension characters only in Clancy's world) but a multiple front situation will truly distabilize most of the global economic "progress"...  </blockquote>LOL, after Red Storm Rising in Clancy's books always go in one basic vein: "somebody annoys America, America crushes them". I doubt he would change that tone soon, I mean have you read SSN, where ONE 688I pwned the whole PLAN and The Bear and The Dragon? I rest my case.<br><br>But in the real world we are seeing something like this happening now, the mess in Iraq emboldening many nations to make a bit more noise. But not sure if full war will actually break out because each of these nations know to avoid war and let it break out elsewhere would mean that you are ultimately in a stronger position in the international stage.<br><br>So it's going to be a game of brinksmanship, as we have seen recently with Iran and NK, which know that the US can't really follow up with their moves with actual threats.</div>

The brits did have a lot of experience in what and what not to do in occupying other countries while the yanks are relative newcomers at this. The fact that your typical yank is rather ignorant of foreign cultures does not help (when told to identify North Korea in a map, some of them stuck the flag on Australia and went "I never knew it was so big compared to 'South Korea' (New Zealand)  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"> ". There you go.<br><br>They did make a serious error in the closing hours of Saddam's regime when they refused to deal with the various tribal leaders who offered to step in once Saddam was gone... which ultimately gave everybody mixed messages in the end. Once the fear and threat of Saddam was gone, it was anybody's guess where all that energy would end up. Truth is, the war the yanks can't win is the one they can't win with bullets and bombs, and with hearts and minds they have traditionally been poorer then the rest of their allies.</div>
