If you like it and can afford it, that's cool by me. I know a ton of folks who have never put on a uniform but they find uses for their military backpacks, boots, BDUs, etc. If they're a wannabe and consider it a fashion statement, more power to 'em.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by beavan:</div><div class="quote_body">things such as?</div></blockquote>Dude, Sheares' name pops up every now and then as the succesfull bidder for (for example) flashlights, boots, training blue guns and holsters to difference agencies. Like KoolKool noted, I check GEBiz all the time to see who's won what and they do make a good living with the larger contracts.<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by p7m13:</div><div class="quote_body">Yeah it's possible that they supply equipment to the SPF etc... I don't think they can survive on just walk-in business.<br></div></blockquote>If a store can position itself to cater to a variety of end users (besides walk-ins), whatever foot traffic they get is a bonus. Here's a possible example....<br><br>This past weekend there was a Level III IPSC match outside of KL and it attracted shooters (both civilians, LE and military) from the region including Singapore, Indonesia, Thailand and even Sri Lanka. We were the primary sponsor for the event and as such had the only booth set-up. I was not there personally but our Malaysia rep/partners was.<br><br>Anyway, to cut a long story short, he was inundated with request for gear from holsters to belts. I guess he walked away with a week's worth of work in tow and we are now in the midst of fulfilling the various requests.<br><br>This is one segment of the market that Sheares does not really cover 'cos they ain't shooters per say. Between this, the Federales and the walk-ins, I think it's a very do-able for a business.<br><br>Anyway, here's another idea for you guys......Group Buys <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>
