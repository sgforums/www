            <div class='col-md body'>saw a question like that in an article sometime ago.  will try to find if i can.  but anyway, just wondering if it would be more effective for SAF to base its force structure on a brigades rather than divisions, especially considering its small size.  ie.  have some combined arms brigades instead of just combined arms divisions.  a combined arms brigade would probably be more useful in limited conflicts and might make for easier deployment, shifting decision making to lower ranking officers in SAF.<br><br>not to say that the army should do away with combined-arms divisions totally though, this will be the stuff that will have to make up the main fight in a conventional traditional war for survival.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I think we should rethink the structure of basic infantry unit itself rather than whether they should operate in Bde or Div level.<br><br>Current Div structure has two light infantry Bdes &amp; one mechanised Bde.The two light infantry Bde is simply too low in firepower in today standard and most excercise the Div commander will most split out some of the mech units to support the infantry units so to increase their firepower.<br><br>Therefore the light infantry bde is just too low in firepower to be fully autonomous in today warfare.<br><br>We should upgrade our Infantry units from light to at least "motorised" with Bronco ATTC to transport our infantry to where action is(afterall some of them are NS men &amp; you need to keep them as fresh as possible b4 the fight), &amp; with some fire support AFV says 12 Terrex with 105mm gun per unit incorporated into every infantry units. This will not only increase firepower &amp; mobility of our infantry , it will also able to operate more autonomous whether as individual battlelion or in Bde level.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>More to add, there were some arguement that SAF should operate in Bde level becos advance in RMA in today warfare. The enemy might have the same type sensors , precision weapons &amp; rapid deployment forces that we have which make the future warfare much more fluid which means quick decision-making much more critical.<br><br>A flatter hieracy will be much more suitable for future warfare so that the a lower ranking officers will make quicker but critical decision becos of fast pace of tomorrow warfare.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I think the reason why we would not move to Bde-based is largely political.<br><br>Basically Divisions "sounds" better than brigade. We are even trying to form a "Armoured Divsion (according to Huxley). Nowadays, Amred brigades just doesn;t have the political impact anymore.<br><br>Also career officers need formations where they can serve. So we will have bigger and bigger formations so that there will be more and more higher positions and can justify higher ranks.<br><br>If we have brigade forces, what will the current Division Principal staff group do??  I won't be surprised that we will have a "Corp" level formation in the future. Maybe a "defensive Corp" with infantry units and a "offensive corp" with Armed and RDF Div.<br></div>

            </div>
            <div class='col-md body'>Personally, I feel that SAF should reorganised the make-up of our fighting forces.<br><br>Firstly, Guards should be the only pure infantry-base combat forces, while all if not, most of the infantry should be converted into armoured infantry operating in small units (ie. 4 man + 2 comdrs section) with fire-power support from the IFV (wheel based-Terrex or even light strike vehicles). These troops can easily be reorganised to conduct infantry type assault or patrols if necessary. One consideration is that the force structure may be too expensive to maintain.<br><br>Secondly, the CADs should have 5 - 6 brigades (1 infantry brigade + 3/4 armoured brigade and an artillery brigade) somewhat like what the American have. These forces can then be task organised into 2 - 3 Task Forces to conduct operations. I believe we should enough brigades to have the proposed structure if we can explore the technological advancement (ie. smaller size forces with fire-support).<br><br>Please comment. Cheers.....<br><br></div>

Let do some calculation:<br><br>6 NSF infantry units which eventually formed 6 Bde in the 3 CADs.<br>2 Guard units which eventually formed how many Bde? Answer is 2.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Well to me being divisioned based is much better.It helps in C&amp;C(command and control)I mean it gives the army and overall sense of direction and coordination.Instead of having  4 brigade command stuff fighting abt plans and then executing it it is easier to have 1 Division stuff planning and executing it.Helps if there is any problems with plans too.</div>
