And since at time the infantry need addition firepower , they get it from the attached units from the SAB. Why we dun simply have them incorporated into the support coy by having 3-4 fire support AFV.<br>We used to have some 106RCL guns which is now replaced by the Spike/Milan for anti tank purpose, they r actually good point fire support asset as well. Since they been withdrawn from most infantry units , we have lost a cheap, effective point fire support asset.<br><br>Another proposal is the ASU to be under the control of Infantry Bde HQ to be attached to infantry when necessary.<br><br>Why am I proposing all this is not to split up any component of SAB which is actually term as the Armour Battle Group  in the Armour units. The ABG is suppose to be core formation of our Armour units and will be the most effective when operating in this manner. That is why the armour formation has their annual exercise in Australia, purely armour units ABG. By losing some component to the infantry , u r reducing the effectiveness of our ABG.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hi |-|05|, I see that you tends to argue your points based on how other armies structured their Div, that is <strong>not the blueprint for the </strong><strong>SAF or any other armies in the world</strong>. That is why there are many variation of structure of a div in all the army.<br><br>How one structured his Div  is based on numbers of factors:<br><br><strong>1.What is the most likely threats that this Div will encounter?</strong>Eg. The PT-91 with ERA, therefore you get Spikes tendam missile.<br><br><strong>2.What is most likely terrains that this Div is going to operate?</strong><br>Eg. Jungle &amp; Urban enviroment, therefore you need light as well as mechaised force.<br><br><strong>3.What roles is this div is going to undertake?</strong><br>Eg, RDF, they need special light weight equipment.<br><br>This is what the army wants but not necessary what they get based on other factors like technological, budget &amp; even political constraints.<br>That is why all armies do not structured it the same way and evolve as factors changes.<br><br>Therefore you should based your arguement on these factors, not how other armies structured their Div &amp; treat it like Bible.<br></div>

The Soviet Union has fielded a new model of armored personnel carrier (APC) every decade since the late 1950s, and in 1967 it deployed the world's first infantry fighting vehicle (IFV). Similar to an APC, the tactically innovative IFV had much greater firepower, in the form of a 73mm main gun, an antitank missile launcher, a heavy machine gun, and firing ports that allowed troops to fire their individual weapons from inside the vehicle. In 1989 the Soviet Union had an inventory of over 65,000 APCs and IFVs, with the latter accounting for almost half of this inventory.<br>Looks like your info is older then you thought.As far as i remember reading in other places also the Russians like most nations have switched to transporting all their infantry by trucks at least.<br>Though i admit my data is old(1989)<br>The Soviet army uses a mix of BMP-2's and BMP-3's IFV's.They are slow to replace them since the their economy is in the dumps.They also use BTR-60's, BTR-70's and BTR-80's APC's<br>Can find an OOB here<a href="http://199.221.15.210/rusmil/UnitRegister.html" rel="nofollow">http://199.221.15.210/rusmil/UnitRegister.html</a> But it wont do you much good since they do not put out types of equipement.But you can see how their army is organized<br><br>Oh and the Russians has special trucks to transport things around around the snow....these had tracks instead of wheels.Anyway most of the Russian infantry is transported by truck to a rail station before being railed wherever.They then load up on trucks and get transported nearer to the lines where they walk.Like all soldiers.</div>

The PT-91 with ERA, therefore you get Spikes tendam missile.<br><br><strong>2.What is most likely terrains that this Div is going to operate?</strong><br>Eg. Jungle &amp; Urban enviroment, therefore you need light as well as mechaised force.<br><br><strong>3.What roles is this div is going to undertake?</strong><br>Eg, RDF, they need special light weight equipment.<br><br>This is what the army wants but not necessary what they get based on other factors like technological, budget &amp; even political constraints.<br>That is why all armies do not structured it the same way and evolve as factors changes.<br><br>Therefore you should based your arguement on these factors, not how other armies structured their Div &amp; treat it like Bible.<br>[/b]</blockquote>I have based my arguement on a number of factors other then how other armies are structured.If you read carefully you would notice i keep leaving out the aviation bde of practically all western armies.I'm also just simply explaining how we are and should be operating at a division level.And because of that we would be fine keeping our current structure since each division still has it's own armour element to provide the extra punch when needed.Making our divisions overall well rounded.Sure it'd be good to switch completely to an mechanized infantry force since those guys do train for jungle warfare(limited but still they do) and we unlike the US do not need to fast depoly troops so we do not need that many light infantry units.(2 bde would be fine)And mechanised forces are still overall the best balanced force.However they are expensive and i wont really trust part-timers too use those equpiment. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz"> And i also think i've been misleading you sorry <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_redface.gif" alt="Embarassed" title="Embarassed"><br>So i'll state my stand now.I personally think the division as it is,is totally fine.We have the right mix of everything.Infantry and armour.When the infantry needs more firepower the armour can provide it depending on where alone the line needs it.While the armour can reform and be used in an attack.In and attack anyway there will be only 2 kinds i believe.An armour spearhead with infantry follow through in urban areas and plains.Or an infantry assualt thourgh the forests of this reigon whereby the use of armour is limited.1 former needing the armour to be bunched up while the infantry would not need the extra firepower since the tanks are suppose to hit 1st.The latter will not see a big role being played by the tanks so they can be spread out to whoever needs the extra firepower.<br>In defence having the armour separated allows you to have them move between the different infantry bde when needed in whatever numbers instead of having say a company of not being used by it's infantry while another bde needs 2 companies of armour while it only has 1 and needs to get the other frm HQ(read the SAB here).<br>So i see no need in changing the structure currentl since the main unit of the army the Division has both armour and infantry and they can be moved around by division HQ.Also at this present structure we can easily convert any of the divisions to a mechanised force easily by simply retraining and giving the units new equipment.Instead of having to do all that PLUS either disband,move or absorb a unit of armour.</div>

Â“It is part of our commitment to modernize the Canadian Forces by re-investing in capital projects that provide the capabilities Canada needs in the emerging international security environment.Â”<br><br>A mobile gun system will provide the Army with a direct-fire capability consistent with its vision to transform into a medium-weight, information age force as outlined in the Army Strategy.<br><br>Â“Transformation is our means of implementing the Army Strategy and our soldiers will see concrete evidence that we are moving forwardÂ—with real, state of the art kit and real, positive change,Â” said Lieutenant-General Rick Hillier. Â“A mobile gun system is the right vehicle for CanadaÂ’s Army and will provide an excellent capability on Canadian Forces operations.Â”<br><br><strong>Acquisition of a mobile gun system will allow us to replace the current fleet of Leopard tanks and continue to maintain direct fire capability.  </strong><br></blockquote>It seem that the Canadian is converting their armoured forces to infantry wif a new direct fire support system.
