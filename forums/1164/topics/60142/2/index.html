            <div class='col-md body'>Taken from the official 10th mountain website<br><blockquote>To meet the ArmyÂ’s requirements to train large numbers of replacements the 10th was reactivated as a training division on July 1, 1948, at Fort Riley, Kansas. It didnÂ’t retain its wartime designation as a Mountain Division and as result lost its "Mountain" tab. The Division had the mission of processing and training new soldiers for service with other Army units. The outbreak of the Korean Conflict in June 1950, enlarged this mission. A total of 123,000 men completed basic training with the 10th during the period 1948-1953.<br>The Division was officially reactivated on February 13, 1985, at Fort Drum, New York as the 10th Mountain Division (Light Infantry). The division commander after reactivation was Brigadier General William S. Carpenter. The 10th was the first division of any kind formed by the Army since 1975 and the first based in the Northeast US since World War II. <strong>The 10th Mountain Division (LI) was designed to meet a wide range of worldwide infantry-intensive contingency missions. Equipment design was oriented toward reduced size and weight for reasons of both strategic and tactical </strong>mobility.</blockquote>Website is here <a href="http://www.drum.army.mil/history/divisionhistory.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.drum.army.mil/history/divisionhistory.htm</a><br>It operates much the same way as the 25th infantry division<br>They are currently the only 3 regular US army divisions that are still light infantry.The rest are Mechanized Infantry.The 82nd and 101st are the 2 Airborne left.<br><br>Edit:the 7th infantry is also light i think....i'm guessing since they're website is not really good and they only have 1 armoured bde instead of something like 3 for the mechanized troops.</div>

The Terrex vehicles are not organic to the infantry units, but are attached and used according to the required mission. My unit already operates in a similar fashion.<br>For the Broncos - my opinion is that these should go to amoured and rapid deployment forces. The British Royal Marine Commandos are starting to receive similar tracked vehicles for future rapid deployments. Not all Broncos are personel vehicles - there are logistics or ambulance, motar carriers, etc.<br>Just my personel views only.</div>

Also, these support units are not from any SAB from what I understand - they are a dedicated support unit by itself. So SAB will not have their effectiveness reduced. Unlike armoured (mechanised) units, infantry units do not use armour transport fulltime. Armour transport are used when only when missions requires it. Vehicles are not suitable for certain terrain or tactical "quietness". Basically they are used for transport and covering support fire. But yes - these vehicles do carry more firepower than light infantry units. I'm quite sure that future developments will be interesting for military nuts, with the Terrex LAV. For me at least - I've been on the navy's fast craft/LST, airforce choppers, and now light armour support.</div>

Also, these support units are not from any SAB from what I understand - they are a dedicated support unit by itself. So SAB will not have their effectiveness reduced. Unlike armoured (mechanised) units, infantry units do not use armour transport fulltime. Armour transport are used when only when missions requires it. Vehicles are not suitable for certain terrain or tactical "quietness". Basically they are used for transport and covering support fire. But yes - these vehicles do carry more firepower than light infantry units. I'm quite sure that future developments will be interesting for military nuts, with the Terrex LAV. For me at least - I've been on the navy's fast craft/LST, airforce choppers, and now light armour support. </div></blockquote>Well you have not only confirmed to what I believe, the SAF has already started to restructure the light infantry Bde.<br><br>Since Armour Support units(ASU) are permanetly attached to your unit maybe becos they r under the direct control of the infantry Bde HQ and been sent out to be attached to units under its wing.<br><br>My view of restructuring of SAF infantry Bde is just that , to have better superior firepower &amp; if neccessary amour protection for foot soldier when need arises and at the same time without losing the stealth, and "lightness" of the light infantry in the jungle enviroment.<br><br>Your suggestion is good one on the Terrex, lightly armoured, good mobility and should I suggest armed with at least 105mm gun for firesupport/antitank.(please note our neighbours are getting more AFV and some r with ERA)<br><br>I am not advocating for them to be restuctured to be fully mechanised forces becos mechanised forces r meant to fight in less forested and even urban enviroment.
