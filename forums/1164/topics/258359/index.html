            <div class='col-md body'>A foreign legion is a regular military force consisting of foreigners who are not normally subjects of the country that employs them. Many countries employed such foreign units prior to the twentieth century. The only remaining ones are those of France, Spain, and Israel; but the phrase foreign legion in English generally refers to the French one.<br><br>* French Foreign Legion<br>* Spanish Foreign Legion<br>* Israeli Machal<br><br>The Netherlands maintained such a force - "KNIL", acronym for Koninklijk Nederlands Indisch Leger or the Royal Netherlands Indies Army. Formed by royal decree on March 10, 1830, it served until the granting of Independence to Indonesia in 1949.<br><br>Other nations have maintained military forces whose members are not citizens but recruited from a single foreign state. The best known are the Gurkha regiments of the present British and Indian armies and the Swiss Guard at the Vatican. Additionally, the Wehrmacht and the Waffen SS raised numerous foreign legions during World War Two.<br><br>http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foreign_legion<br><br>***<br><br>Just for some background.I'm thinking of perhaps serving with the Israeli Machal.I know that Singapore has a ruling against it,but I am 'crazy' enough to want to serve with a foreign unit.<br><br>I would like to serve some time in a military that has an actual chance at combat ops,rather than serving in a military whose main goal is deterrence and posturing.<br><br>I entertained thoughts of joining the Spanish or French Foreign Legions,but figured that the Israeli Machal is a better balance, at 3 years rather than 5 years or more with the other services.<br><br>What do you think?<br><br><strong>I am already aware of the Official Security Act and the restrictions it places on Singaporeans serving as 'foreign mercenaries' or as professionals in foreign militaries,but I do not really give a damn.It's probably been done and it is not as if they will bother prosecute me.I never served in a sensitive post,but as all Singaporean soldiers,we are aware of sensitive information relevant to our posts and appointments.I just want your honest opinions and advice</strong><br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>just dun understand why some ppl want to put their lives on the line to serve a foreign army/nation/politician selfish agenda. it's not like your involvement can make the world a better place or make you a better person(i dun think taking killing another person who's not a threat to your life/country makes you a more compassionate person). yes you may say it is for the experience. but will this experience make your life more enriching? as in, killing another person with no reason(it's not like that person you killed is a threat to your life/country) will not make you a happier person or someone who treasure life more but makes you more like a murderer.</div>

And pulling security in Fallujah does not make you a murderer.<br><br>Murder is premediated killing for it's own sake, or for the sake of pleasure. Pulling security or fighting for certain ideals is far more different. Please get that distinction clear.<br><br>There are ex-Singaporeans serving in the US Army Reserve because they feel that they have to give back their new nation what it has given them. The notion of service to a state or ideals is something not every layman in Singapore can understand.<br><br>Some people have their own calling in life. Let's respect that even if you cannot agree.</div>
