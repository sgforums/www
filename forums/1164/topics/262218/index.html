            <div class='col-md body'>South China Sea (and to a lesser extent Sulu Sea) are strategic sea lanes for transporting oil and materials to China, Korea and Japan, hence it is logical to have a base in that region. I don't think M'sia wants or can afford an aircraft carrier (to carry fighter planes) or even a large helicopter carrier. Maybe a fleet of LST like our Endurance class is what they are planning for (they do have a shortage in modern LST/supply ship in their fleet). The Chakri Naruebet is a good example of white elephant and what not to buy. If they aren't planning on their own LST, the question is which navy's aircraft carrier are they thinking of hosting. Probably not US. Hmm..maybe Russian? Which other navy has aircraft/helicopter carriers?</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote>Read the news about Australian Navy procurement with power projection. Talks about navy expansion here in asia..... Sizzling !<br></blockquote>They have a rather transparent procurement process. That is not the case for most of Asia though. Singapore is secretive. You`ll only smell it when it`s baked and ready to be served. The Malaysians are hazy and confused mostly about what they want to get due to political inteference and deep-seated corruption.  The Indonesian processes are leaky due the sheer size of the country and the political apparatus. The Burmese are even more secretive than we are. But I suspect that the country`s intelligence agencies are probably littered with foreign and internal agents.<br><br>What is more interesting about the Australian navy`s plans and the transparency it has gone about actualizing it is the trail-blazing that it is doing for other countries in the region or the scenarios she thinks that she will be in. It is likely that many countries in SEA have already extrapolated similar scenarios.<br><br>The new RAN ships will only be coming online next decade. Is this a picture of what the navies in SEA will be like ;albiet the RAN has other global responsibilities as well? The RSN has already 6 Formidables in the water equipped with Asters. The last  AA saw ST Marine showcasing even larger stealthy ship designs with larger tonnages. Both Malaysia and Indonesia are keen on increasing the capabilities of thier respective navies as well.<br><br>Of course, this pales in comparison to the defence build-up in North East Asia. But as they say, history always repeat itself. The ancient crop of ex-WW2 leaders are just about gone. Future crop of leaders in our region would be less than coy to flex thier military muscle or even strain them to the point of  conflict. This can already be seen in some instances.<br><br>Is the RAN and therefore SEA preparing for a potential conflict in East Asia which would pull all these countries in big or small ways? Interesting times.<br><br></div>
