            <div class='col-md body'>Another way we have of defeating MLRS is the Longshot LOCAAS system developed by ST Dynamics:<br><br><a href="http://aa.janes.com/docs/aa/show_daily/news1Mar2002_101609.shtml" rel="nofollow">http://aa.janes.com/docs/aa/show_daily/news1Mar2002_101609.shtml</a><br><br>It will glide a dumb bomb to a GPS location up to 110km from the launching platform. No word about the accuracy or the maximum weight of the bomb, but I would think a couple of F-16s each armed with 2-4 Longshot cluster bombs should be able to decimate any MLRS launch site within range of Singapore, without even leaving Singapore's airspace.<br><br>Of course, the glide bombs themselves may be shot down, but depending on their speed they may be very hard for Malaysian air defense to intercept. Then again, we can probably saturate the MLRS firing site with enough incoming bombs to overwhelm any air defense. This is expensive, but MLRS launchers are just as costly.<br><br>In fact, Longshot is even more dangerous than MLRS since it has a longer range, is harder to counter, may be more accurate, and can be launched from anywhere, not just a small number of ground-based launch sites. Our larger airforce means that we can use LOCAAS technology better than the Malaysians. In essence, every plane that we have becomes a small MLRS launcher with this technology (though with more expensive ammo and more difficult logistics).</div>
