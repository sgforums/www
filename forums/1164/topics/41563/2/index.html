            <div class='col-md body'>The key to countering MLRS is detecting them. There are two scenarios. The first is where Singapore is attacking. In this case, Singaporean intelligence agents (i.e. spies), special forces and technical intelligence assets (i.e. satellites, spy aircraft, ELINT, etc) would have pinpointed the positions of a majority of the MLRS already. You can bet that Singapore is working hard to find out exactly where they are at all times and we will only launch an attack if we are sure we can neutralize them. So in the opening phases of a war where Singapore is attacking preemptively, the MLRS along with other military targets like fuel depots, airbases, communications centres, etc will be attacked by special forces and airstrikes. In this case, Malaysia will only be able to fire a small number of MLRS before they are all destroyed, which is good.<br><br>The other case has Malaysia attacking first. In this case, the MLRS will reveal their positions when they fire. Once they are detected, they will probably be destroyed by fixed-wing strike aircraft, due to the urgency of the situation.  In order for an airstrike to occur, enemy air defenses must be suppressed and interceptors shot down. In order to obtain the partial air superiority needed for limited airstrikes, around 1-2 hours of air ops are needed, before the strike wing can safely launch and strike the target. This means that Malaysia will be able to get off several waves of MLRS, which is bad, except that it makes Singapore look like the victim, which is good. The really bad thing is if they damage our airbases, preventing us from quickly counterattacking.<br><br>Which is more likely? It is an open secret that in any conflict between Singapore and Malaysia, Singapore has to attack preemptively to survive. Therefore, Malaysia's purchase of MLRS makes it even more imperative that we strike first. If we detect that the MLRS might be moving into firing positions, we might have to launch a war immediately to survive. This means that this purchase of MLRS is horribly destabilising to the region and brings the region close to war. It is not just their own throat they are slitting, but everyone else's too. What are they thinking? Are they thinking?</div>

MBTs by itself also not worrying.

            <div class='col-md body'>Well....as discussed in an earlier post, the best way to counter the MLRS is to detect it early. So therefore, we have to have good HUMINT on the location of the ASTROs. A feasible way might be to just narrow down the areas of possible MLRS launch sites and send in special forces...have them operate 2-3 months at a stretch hunting ASTROs. Maybe provide air support if possible. ASTRO hunters man... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"></div>

It is to create a buffer zone to reduce chances of Singapore mainland being bombard by cheap conventional weapon , to reduce the chances of MAF to actually see Singapore and to capture key water and food sources if the war will to be long. But usually , i believe after capturing the land , Singapore or Malaysia would be calling for a crease fire and the war should be soon over..</div>
