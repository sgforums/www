            <div class='col-md body'>Depends on unit.  Generally speaking... because the training programme is packed into shorter ICTs (compared to the old days ... pre-1990),  it can be quite hectic.   Plus nowadays, there is less emphasis on discipline (haircut, dress code).  But does not mean you don't get a scolding or some kind of retribution from the seniors.<br><br>Maybe those you saw were in storeman vocations ... there are off-duty periods. Or maybe the commanders are not managing their men's time properly.  When I was doing reservist, our CO let the men off in the afternoon, on the understanding that they book in by a certain time.  So they can go and visit the nearby shopping centre and do whatever they need to do outside and not lounge around in the camp and cause embarrassment.<br><br>For the officers and specs,  there are briefings and meetings, so not so lucky. However, we get our time off in other periods , e.g. when the men are doing some in-camp admin, that is supervised by the regular cadre in the camp, and does not require our presence.<br><br>All boils down to the management of everyone's time.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I was a NSF ICT clerk last time, u can see different soldiers wif different attitudes wif their ICT.<br><br>Ususally, the "freshie" soldiers (just ORD and kena ICT). Are more responsive, keep to the rules, ppl are more "on".<br><br>I believe these ppl you met are most likely nearing the end of their 13 year cycle. These grp ususally are more bo-chup liao, the men, the officers all ROD mood liao so bo pian one.<br><br>Furthermore, ICT soldiers tend to ignore ranks because of the civilian work structure. What I mean is, the reservist officers tend to related better to their men as compare to the active lot. Some even enjoy close friendship, i.e. I once seen a Major and a LCP who are very good friends!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_eek.gif" alt="Shocked" title="Shocked"><br><br></div>

In turn, the CO was good to him and they worked along very very well.<br><br>In my case, my PC after the 2nd ICT, pulled me aside and told me to stop addressing him as "sir". In front of the platoon, he was to be addressed as LTA so and so. When we were alone , I could call him by his first name.  When we moved camps, there were not enough bunks to go around and some sgts had to bunk in with the junior officers LTAs  (4 or 5 to a room).  For some reason, he and I shared only with another sgt (3 to a room) ........Obviously, he became a friend of mine and we covered for  each other pretty well.
