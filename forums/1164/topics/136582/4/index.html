How much school fees have been subsidised since you started schooling? Which other country will give ERS in times of difficulty? The amount of income tax as compare to many other nations, have you looked into it? Cars maybe expensive but with such complex transport system, do you really have to drive? For ego or for convenience? Unable to fulfile your ego, push the blame on the government and country.<br><br>Its fated that you are born in Sg and so be it. Your roots will be in Sg. Be proud of it.<br><br>The country and government have done alot for the citizens. The little thing we can do is by defending it. May not for just military defence.

Parallel to this dialogue, Norwatch brought the issue concerning Singapore Technologies to the attention of the Norwegian Ministry of Trade and Industry. The latter party's interest in the matter sped up the decision on the portfolio structure in the Asia fund somewhat, but did not influence Asset Management's conclusion concerning the company.<br><br>The decision made on Tuesday, 28 June is based on a review of the overall structure of the fund in view of the ethical guidelines currently under preparation by Asset Management, which include the following statement: "DnB NOR Asset Management will not invest in companies that deliberately harm people or the environment or neglect democratic principles. These aspects must be considered prior to making investments. Assessments of companies the funds invest in must be based on their intentions rather than their past history." </blockquote>fr <a href="http://www.dnbnor.com/en/default.asp?p=26000&amp;ce=444870" rel="nofollow">http://www.dnbnor.com/en/default.asp?p=26000&amp;ce=444870</a><br><br>2.Thanks God it specfiied that ST make land mine for defense.<br>As a tiny red dot country(so small it may called a city state),we have not interested to attack or/and occupy other country--big or small.<br>I remember LKY mentioned we can attack other,but occupation is a problem.<br>From new recruit to CDF,only those crazy one looking for war.If they can afford, they will swim in a club in weekend.If they cant afford,eat in big M luh.<br>What for goes for WAR!!<br><br>3.If ST stop making land mines,do u think other countries will stop making it<br>or destory them?Dunt be so naive!!Politicians in other countries have<br>500 reasons to go for war if they think the war is good for themselves.Note,<br>I mean good for them ,not the country.Why the son in law of Trade and Industry Minister can get so many licenses or concessions to import car?<br>The tempations of power or money or pride etc is so hugh that going<br>for war never to be ruled out!!<br><br>4.But any one tease with Sg will pay a price,so do we in defense side.<br>It is wise to sweat 100 times than bleeding once in battle.<br><br>5.<strong>US $100 billions</strong><br>Our reserves  is the real reasons that they want to eat Sg.What for to feed 3.2 millions people,to occupy land without natural resources,etc.<br><br>If they can,only if,the first thing they do is to transfer<br>the assests to their bank accounts!!!Ours is made up of 90 % of cash<br>(easily) convertiable assets,shares bonds etc.Just a clicks can sell<br>billions  in markets.</div>

It's a kind of rage I am not even normally aware I have. Somehow, when I feel afraid or threatened I immediately tap into this pool of anger and focus it.

If you were victimised and you beat off the enemy advances, then there is some pride in it. However, if you invaded others' territory and rape their civillians, that is shameful.
