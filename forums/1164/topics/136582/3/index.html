The people who don't want to take life are the same people who don't intend to even be around to give their lives in the first place.<br><br>For those who are convinced that Singapore is worth fighting for, their reasons revolve around bonds of kinship with family and friends as well as loyalty to the land. Other reasons seem to be investments (of financial or emotional nature) in Singapore.<br><br>For those who are NOT convinced, their reasons revolve around self-preservation &amp; to some extent the fact that their families would have fled.

These people no longer seem to be talking about how they would not kill, they are talking about how they would not die for their country.<br><br>Ironic isn't it? The people who don't want to take life are the same people who don't intend to even be around to give their lives in the first place.<br><br>For those who are convinced that Singapore is worth fighting for, their reasons revolve around bonds of kinship with family and friends as well as loyalty to the land. Other reasons seem to be investments (of financial or emotional nature) in Singapore.<br><br>For those who are NOT convinced, their reasons revolve around self-preservation &amp; to some extent the fact that their families would have fled. These people say they need to carry on the family name, assets can be transferred overseas, regimes &amp; nations are no different etc...</div></blockquote>Okay, now that the whole thing has been summarised..let's put our views down.<br><br>Me..I would kill for Singapore the land, but I would try not to die for her if I can make my enemy die for her instead.</div>
