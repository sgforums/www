Gratitude to the Australian vets of all wars but shame on you for having this very heavy chip on your shoulders.<br><br>I have read a book on Australians' involvement in Vietnam and have nothing but admiration for their bravery, fighting skills and correct CT tactics as opposed to the Americans' "Search &amp; Destroy" heavy handedness.

However, having had family members who fought in the Korean war and heard some of the stories I can assure you that I would much rather have been a prisoner of the allies than the NK/Chinese. </div></blockquote> obviously you only heard the stories from the south koreans or the allied forces, not the north koreans. difficulty in getting the other side of the story does not make your story the true story. You koreans or americans who fought in the korean war???<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by digger:</div><div class="quote_body">Of course with Singapore having never fired a bullet in anger and with their total lack of support to their so called friends when it comes to putting troops in the line of fire ( lets face it,internationally the Sing defence forces haven't exactly got the"thru the door first reputation)<br>you guys have had an easy ride.  </div></blockquote> that is totally uncalled for.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mad.gif" alt="Mad" title="Mad"> First of all, we did not start a war among ourselves, the north vs the south. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"> there is only one self proclaimed world policeman, the american. singapore is a sovereign country, we are friends to many countries but we do not have foreign forces permanently stationed on our land. we decide where do we want to send our troops.

Exposing the true faces of those who commited atrocities is not "trying to demeen", it is just a tender reminder that those who always claim moral high ground have their "DARK SIDE"!!!</div>
