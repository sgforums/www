            <div class='col-md body'>Personally, I don't see any point in going belt-fed.  Sure, the Ultimax's 100-round drum needs to be loaded by machine, but then again, would you want to link 100 5.56 rounds into a belt?  Besides, I managed to squeeze about 65 rounds into the drum mag before the spring became too stiff to take in any more.<br><br>On top of that, with belts, the links translate to extra weight that you have to hump through the boonies.<br><br>Overall, if there was one improvement that I would like to see on an Ultimax, it would be a rifle-style handgrip instead of the front pistol grip - the pistol grip makes it a bugger to control, especially while firing and charging.</div>

Sure, the Ultimax's 100-round drum needs to be loaded by machine, but then again, would you want to link 100 5.56 rounds into a belt?  Besides, I managed to squeeze about 65 rounds into the drum mag before the spring became too stiff to take in any more.<br><br>On top of that, with belts, the links translate to extra weight that you have to hump through the boonies.<br><br>Overall, if there was one improvement that I would like to see on an Ultimax, it would be a rifle-style handgrip instead of the front pistol grip - the pistol grip makes it a bugger to control, especially while firing and charging.</div></blockquote>Well, being belt-fed is an advantage when you're doing defence.

The entire idea of the SAW is something that is a lot more mobile (read lighter) than a GPMG, but that can maintain a higher rate of fire than a rifle.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>hmm ...some times it just boils down to the dictum .."Less is more"<br>question, what was the original idea of developing a weapon that could deliver a higher rate of fire than a ordinary M16, AK-47 rifle ? it should be light, easy to use, deliver the supposed rate of fire it has to and gets the job done.<br><br>It might be overkill to incooperate the belt fed feature and the magazine feature..<br><br>Sometimes i wish designers could just return to the drawing board and just sit down and think what they wish for a weapon that could complement the sections firepower and such...Forms follow function.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"><br><br>lastly..this is my personal thought, u can flame me only ON this point, i don't really fancy all the picatinny rail sights...with extra LAD, torch light, forward grip etc... bigger optical scope. i see those american troops attach soo much stuff on their weapons, reminds me of ATEC where u have to fit the MILES laser module along with the LAD and all that..rather clumsy right ?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br>okay ...i still like the SAW with its 30 rnd Magazine. =) light effective and deadly ...<br><br>Oh yeah ..Happy Chinese Lunar New Yr !! hope u guys are having fun in singapore .. i am shivering in the winter in summer weather Down Under !! <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes">  .!!!</div>

Our section NVGs cannot be mounted on any of our light arms including the SAR21? Despite some units testing helmet mounted sights, which is helpfull in the dark - but how do you prone and aim your weapon with a helmet mounted NVG sight? It would be great if optical sights can be used on the weapons as an option.<br><br>SAR 21 SAW may or may not be inferior - I don't know. But looking the British experience of using a magazine fed weapon for support in Iraq does raise some questions. (Yes, the SA80 series had its fair share of problems and only uses 30 round magazines) They have selected the para version of the FN Minimi as their new SAW (fires from belts and mags).<br>The Brit infantry section now has 2 SAWs, 2 SA80 LSW as sharpshooters(!), 2 SA80A2 with GLs, and 2 SA80A2. Currently only China would be using a bullpup SAW.<br>The Germans did not select the G36 SAW version (uses drum mags) - and instead are using the HK MG43 for their sections (fires from 5.56mm belts only). Our neighbours Indonesia, Malaysia and the Philipines have the FN Minimi/M249 in their sections.<br><br>As for the Ultimax 100 - maybe keep it. Come up with a new Mark 4 version - with the picatinny rails (at the very least for our foreign customers), folding butt, newer drum mags (get or copy from others), allow it to accept the same mags as the SAR21 (or other mags for foreign customers), improved bipods/fore grip, and improve the general quality of the product. Perhaps our left handers can use the Ultimax instead of the SAR21.<br><br>Happy Chinese New Year!<br><br></div>
