            <div class='col-md body'>The Ultimax series of SAW have serve SAF for a long time already. I have personally fired the SAW MK2/3 before and i am surprised at the relatively low recoil and high accuracy. The weapon itself is also relatively light for an auto weapon,it uses the same 5.56 rounds like the SAR21,the magazine can also be shared. In short it is very beneficial to us. However it came to my knowledge that the SAR21 series of weapons also include a SAW version. My question is how does this new version compare with the one alraedy in service? Thanks. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>SAR21 for the replacement of the Ultimax as the LMG would be a mistake.This was shown by what happened when the British fielded the SA80 SAW version.30 rounds/magazine to provide covering fire is not practical at all...The weapon can zap out all the rounds in like 5secs...<br><br>Perhaps they could make the already effective Ultimax 100 more efficient with the inclusion of a reflex sight or something.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hi Specops. I do agree with you to some extent that the British move to use the SA80 SAW variant was a bad idea, but I believe that the SA80 was an inherently flawed weapon to begin with. Even with extensive modifications, the stock SA80 performs much better today, but remains problematic and unreliable compared to other bullpup rifles.<br><br>That said, the flaw of the SA80 SAW variant was not strictly due to its 30 round magazine, since the Ultimax itself is usually used with a 30 round mag as well. Many argue that the ultimax may be used with a 100 round mag, but neglect to mention that filling these 100 round mags require heavy machinery due to the powerful springs in the drums, which makes it difficult to do out in the field.<br><br>I am not in support of the Ultimax being phased out. But then, it does have its drawbacks, with the drum issue being one of them. I admit the argument isn't straightforward tho. For one thing, one reasonable way round it is to modify the ultimax so that it can be belt-fed (easier said than done), but one has to admit there are certain advantages with a 100 round drum that a loose box with a belt of rounds won't have.<br><br>My 2 cents worth.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I agree with the fact that the Ultimax flaw lies in it being either box fed or 100-rounds drum fed.Belt-fed weapons though can hold easily like 200 rounds,but it may be entangled with the vegetation or may get caught by fixtures when the SAW gunner is doing FIBUA.Besides,a drum mag though difficult to reload does have its advantages in the sense that I would say it is almost tangle free,and that it will take a lesser time to reload the weapon compared with using belt-fed ammunition,which seems to be more cumbersome during the reloading phase.<br><br>However,just to side-track alittle,there are C-mags for M16 right?But does the SAF use those?And if used,who will be using them?The normal riflemen or the SAW gunner who will then be armed with an M16?Although I do agree that the SAF SAW gunners usually use the standard M16 box magazine, but doesn't it defeat the purpose as the SAW gunners will zap out the entire magazine of round in a blink of an eye.<br><br>However,we must bear in mind that,in the platoon level operations,there is a GPMG support team which uses the FN MAG GMPG which fires from belts of 7.62mm ammunition.And if the GPMG is fitted with a bipod,it makes the weapon more mobile and provides more firepower due to its calibre and higher rate of fire.Thus,the need for a belt-fed SAW in the section level is removed due to the availability of the GPMG which is belt-fed to provide additional firepower.<br><br>But surely,SAF will have a small amount of most types of weapons in the world for our Spec Ops forces to operate with.If the need is there,perhaps the SAF could consider a weapon along the lines of the IDF Negev or FN M249 Minimi,both are belt-fed and combat proven. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>The Ultimax 30 rnd magazine is not compatible with the standard M16 magazine. M16 magazines has only 1 magazine catch hole where the SAW magazine has 2.usually is Ultimax magzine is compatible with M16 weapons more likely.<br><br>The SAW gunner will carry 3.0 contact rate on him for a attack.which translate to another 8 magazine in a fieldpack carried by him.<br><br>The SAW is a gd weapon in terms in low recoil and accuracy. One of the 101st Airborne guys described the guy has feather weight LMG with the accuracy of a M16 . They hammered 30 rnd magazines into the Fig 10 targets.<br><br>The need for a belt fed SAW is dependent on the type of mission profile that the soldiers are using. SOF of course need the high rate of fire due to their limited operators in each team.<br><br>Infantry and Guards units fight as part of a larger unit, so hence the mobility is more important.<br><br>Don't forget, our SAF switched to the SBO harness 10 yrs or so back, they dumped the jungle belt and the SAW gunner ammo pouches with it.</div>

The blanks issues cannot even support auto firing for M16 thus it will alway jam when use on Ultimax 100. This cause the negative views.<br><br>In real life, it beat the other light machine guns like FN M249 Minimi , on its weight, little or no recoil, handle with a single hand, the most acurate and have one of the longest range.<br><br>Yes some folks view that without belt feed, it is a disadvantage. But as a light machine gun that is so controllable &amp; acurate with so little recoil, it sort of have the advantages of hitting the target with light control brusts. Thus even with a 30 round magazine, it is more effective with control burst then a belt feed 100 round belt on other machine guns. Remember it is the gun that hit the target with the less rolls that is good, not something that shoot the whole belt area target as it is harder to control. Thus it is this point that make it so endearing to the special forces.<br><br></div>

But the drum magazine was used before also right ? Just curious ..how big,heavy troublesome is the machine or tools used to feed the rnds into the drum magazine ?<br><br>Everyone is going belt belt belt..one thing to consider, is using a belt fed SAW going to be lighter ? I mean the mechanisms needed for the belt fed and extraction. If the Mini and Negev weapons were belt fed as well, chances of the mechanisms of a GPMP based feeding tray and extraction system has to be in place.<br><br>Maybe the designers designed the weapon for portability and ease of use.Stripping and maintening the SAW is so simple, just removing the butt and taking out the bolt assembly<br><br>There will always be its detractors of a belt fed and magazine fed weapon always..on the bright side..the SAW with a 30 rnd magazine is light.Maybe with the new SBO, the SAW gunners might get dedicated pounhes for holding all 16 magazines on him. I don't really like the idea of sloshing ard a 100 rnd box in humid conditions, the sound of clanking rnds can be heard from afar. my unit's SOP is to lay the ammo boxes with old sandbags to reduce the clanking.</div>
