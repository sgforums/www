            <div class='col-md body'>Guardsmen Sense Ghostly Presence In New Orleans<br><br>(CBS5) The presence of the supernatural and the influence of voodoo long have been synonymous with New Orleans.<br><br>In the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina, members of the U.S. military are saying that there's something spooky going on and it's not just images of death and destruction that's haunting them.<br><br>By all accounts, the Sophie B. Wright Middle School in New Orleans sits empty and evacuated except for military personnel who have taken over the campus as a staging site for missions around the battered city.<br><br>But the men in uniform have the feeling that they're not alone. It prompted a chaplain to utter this directive: "In the name of Jesus Christ, I command you Satan to leave the dark areas of this building."<br><br>Said Sgt. Robin Hairston of the California National Guard: "I was in my sleeping bag and I opened by eyes and in the doorway was a little girl," . "It wasn't my imagination."<br><br>Hairston wasn't the only one seeing things. Spc. Rosales Leanor had her own close encounter.<br><br>"I was using the restroom and I just saw a little shadow," Leanor said, "kind of looming in front of me."<br><br>Another member of the Guard unit said that she saw and heard a little girl laughing when she opened a closet that contained cleaning supplies.<br><br>At a Baton Rouge marina, boats were strewn like trash, but not a shred of paper could be found. Except for the pages of a Bible, which was found by a soldier. It was open to the Book of Revelations.<br><br>At a nearby church, nearly destroyed, another Bible was found, showing the exact same passage from Revelations.<br><br>Like the power of nature, there is a power at work in New Orleans that defies explanation.<br>----<br><br>I wonder what passage it was..  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_eek.gif" alt="Shocked" title="Shocked"></div>

And he said unto me, Take it, and eat it up; and it shall make thy belly bitter, but it shall be in thy mouth sweet as honey.<br><br>10And I took the little book out of the angel's hand, and ate it up; and it was in my mouth sweet as honey: and as soon as I had eaten it, my belly was bitter.<br><br>11And he said unto me, Thou must prophesy again before many peoples, and nations, and tongues, and kings.<br><br>Revelation 11<br><br>1And there was given me a reed like unto a rod: and the angel stood, saying, Rise, and measure the temple of God, and the altar, and them that worship therein.<br><br>2But the court which is without the temple leave out, and measure it not; for it is given unto the Gentiles: and the holy city shall they tread under foot forty and two months.<br><br>3And I will give power unto my two witnesses, and they shall prophesy a thousand two hundred and threescore days, clothed in sackcloth.<br><br>4These are the two olive trees, and the two candlesticks standing before the God of the earth.<br><br>5And if any man will hurt them, fire proceedeth out of their mouth, and devoureth their enemies: and if any man will hurt them, he must in this manner be killed.<br><br>6These have power to shut heaven, that it rain not in the days of their prophecy: and have power over waters to turn them to blood, and to smite the earth with all plagues, as often as they will.<br><br>7And when they shall have finished their testimony, the beast that ascendeth out of the bottomless pit shall make war against them, and shall overcome them, and kill them.<br><br>8And their dead bodies shall lie in the street of the great city, which spiritually is called Sodom and Egypt, where also our Lord was crucified.<br><br>9And they of the people and kindreds and tongues and nations shall see their dead bodies three days and an half, and shall not suffer their dead bodies to be put in graves.<br><br>10And they that dwell upon the earth shall rejoice over them, and make merry, and shall send gifts one to another; because these two prophets tormented them that dwelt on the earth.<br><br>11And after three days and an half the spirit of life from God entered into them, and they stood upon their feet; and great fear fell upon them which saw them.<br><br>12And they heard a great voice from heaven saying unto them, Come up hither. And they ascended up to heaven in a cloud; and their enemies beheld them.<br><br>13And the same hour was there a great earthquake, and the tenth part of the city fell, and in the earthquake were slain of men seven thousand: and the remnant were affrighted, and gave glory to the God of heaven.<br><br>14The second woe is past; and, behold, the third woe cometh quickly.<br><br>15And the seventh angel sounded; and there were great voices in heaven, saying, The kingdoms of this world are become the kingdoms of our Lord, and of his Christ; and he shall reign for ever and ever.<br><br>16And the four and twenty elders, which sat before God on their seats, fell upon their faces, and worshipped God,<br><br>17Saying, We give thee thanks, O LORD God Almighty, which art, and wast, and art to come; because thou hast taken to thee thy great power, and hast reigned.<br><br>18And the nations were angry, and thy wrath is come, and the time of the dead, that they should be judged, and that thou shouldest give reward unto thy servants the prophets, and to the saints, and them that fear thy name, small and great; and shouldest destroy them which destroy the earth.<br><br>19And the temple of God was opened in heaven, and there was seen in his temple the ark of his testament: and there were lightnings, and voices, and thunderings, and an earthquake, and great hail.</div>
