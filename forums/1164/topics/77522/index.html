            <div class='col-md body'>Hi all,<br><br>My maiden posting here so forgive me if I break any taboos. I've read the previous thread on ASTROS but found that most posts concentrate on the merits of ASTROS/MLRS itself. Hence, I would like to bring out a slightly different point: the effectiveness of anti-ASTROS measures. During the First Gulf War, the Coalition devoted a substantial amount of resources (15% of Coalition aircraft and SOP forces e.g. SAS) to finding Iraq's mobile Scud launchers but this was widely regarded as one of the most famous failures of the Gulf War. See <a href="http://www.cdiss.org/scudnt6.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.cdiss.org/scudnt6.htm </a>main reasons being Iraqi deception and "shoot and scoot" capabiliy of Iraqi missile crews. If the US could not pinpoint those Scud launchers in the wide open Arabian deserts, what chance does the SAF has against a well-hidden ASTROS unit in secondary rainforest, ready to scramble after firing? Would any expert like to clarify on our counter-battery options? Second point, I think many of the posts about the ASTROS's accuracy are tactically correct but strategically off the mark. Coming back to the First Gulf War, the Scuds were not used against Coalition forces but Israeli cities. In a heavily built-up area like Singapore, the ASTROS does not have to be very accurate to inflict massive civilian casualties. Israel got off lightly but during the Iran-Iraq war when Iraq sent a torrent of Scuds on Teheran in the "War of the Cities", the casualties were severe. Due to the distance between Iraq and Israel coupled with sophisticated monitoring equipment, Israel was able to have a few minutes of advance warning, enough time to sound an air raid siren and send its people into shelters. Can Singapore do the same with a Malaysian ASTROS rocket from Johor? Added to this, we do not have any technology to shoot rockets out of the sky. I've heard of the I-Hawk being modified for anti-ballistic missile function in the US though.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Heh, you're from NTU rite. Engin there is xiong. Yah true, no two situations are alike. Another difference is that Scuds are tactical ballistic missiles and ASTROS are rockets. But I feel the analogy is still holds in Singapore's case. I quote Derek da Cunha, S'porean defence analyst:<br><br><strong>A simple description of the effect of the different impact of artillery employed by Malaysia and Singapore against each other is suffice to make the point of how artillery could skew the dynamic and provide a possible equaliser in firepower terms for Malaysia. A battalion of MLRS, such as the Astros II, although an area saturation system, is essentially a tactical unit. If such a battalion is deployed by the Singapore Armed Forces to the northern part of the island facing Malaysia, it remains a tactical unit. However, if the same MLRS battalion is deployed by the Malaysian Armed Forces to the southern part of peninsular Malaysia, facing Singapore, it is likely to instantly transform itself from a tactical to a strategic unit, because it brings the entire, heavily builtup and densely populated island of Singapore within range. Geographical asymmetry thus results in a significant military asymmetry. Indeed, in conceptual terms, this in fact can be viewed as a form of asymmetrical warfare.<br><br>The argument can be advanced further and put it in more graphic terms. Once the Malaysian MLRS battalion and other heavy artillery become operational and are deployed in significant numbers in the near future, one might then be able to describe<br>the Malaysian Armed Forces in relation to the Singapore Armed Forces by drawing an analogy from medieval times. The Singapore Armed Forces could be described as a rapier; it is manoeuvrable, slick, and, in the hands of a skilled swordsman, can do all the fancy moves in attempting to deliver the lethal stab. On the other hand, the Malaysian Armed Forces is like a broadsword; its not very manoeuvrable, not slick, and, even in the hands of as skilled swordsman, is unlikely to do all the fancy moves. Indeed, it is fairly lumbering and unwieldy.

            <div class='col-md body'>once those rockets are in the air i don't suppose there's anything we can do to prevent casualties do we? all we can do is try to take out the ASTROS' from the air before it can let loose the next salvo..and probably return fire with our own artillery i suppose  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_neutral.gif" alt="Neutral" title="Neutral"></div>
