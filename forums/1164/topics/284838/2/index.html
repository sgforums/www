The party believed that if necessary Indonesia should temporarily cut the bilateral diplomatic ties.<br><br>"We must have the gut to take a stern action. We very much regret it, we are angry because the government is very weak toward Malaysia.

She was then taken into custody, said the embassy.<br><br>However, Malaysia has denied detaining her. Rela director-general Datuk Zaidon Asmuni said Ms Muslianah Nurdin produced an identification card but was released after officers found out she was the wife of a diplomat.<br><br>But the chairman of the PAN faction said the incident proved that the Malaysians and their security agencies had deliberately intended to humiliate Indonesians.<br><br>"They have done it systematically. We have to fight them. Malaysia has started to become racist," said Mr Zulkifli Hasan.<br><br>"If we remain silent, they will look down on us, consider us weak and later humiliate us even more rudely," he added.<br><br><a href="http://www.todayonline.com/pda/216037ag.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.todayonline.com/pda/216037ag.htm</a></div>
