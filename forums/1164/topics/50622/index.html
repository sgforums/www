Of little practical use.  More likely it was Hitler's hatred for Communism and Stalingrad's symbolic status that sent Germans to Stalingrad.  The only importance of Stalingrad in more opinion is that it tied up hell of alot of German resources that could be better used against the Allies.<br><br>And erm, Operation Market Garden anyone?  largest airborne operation in history...<br></div></blockquote>Pity the bold Market Garden failed, but even if it did succeed, it would by their prediction bring VE-Day earlier, Christmas of 44.

However Poland didn't really test the mettle of the Blitzkreig theory to the full. The Polish were too weak and ill-prepared for the job. I would say that the pivotal moment for Blitzkreig was the invasion of France and the Low Countries in 1940, where the Germans took on the French and BEF who knew they were coming (albeit using inferior tactics).<br><br>Another pivotal point was the bitter struggle for the SW Pacific, including the battles for Guadacanal, the Solomons, PNG etc. Many historians regard Midway as the turning point of the Pacific War, but the fact was that Midway balanced the war, but the SW Pacific battles was the one which turned the tide in that it wore the Japanese war machine down and allowed American industrial supremacy to come through.<br><br>Laser51088, Market-Garden was a grand f***-up of historic proportions.

Both are must reads if you want info on Market Garden, although the first is more detailed since it was focused only on that op, although Citizen Soldiers covered the Western Allies advance up NW Europe so had less focus on Market-Garden, it has access to newer info (since it was about 20 years later than Ryan's work).</div>

I still don't think the Germans would have collapsed had Market Garden succeeded. Remember even if it succeeded the Allies still had to counter the 25 divisions used at the Ardennes Offensive which would undoubtedly have been used to counter any Market Garden success.</div>
