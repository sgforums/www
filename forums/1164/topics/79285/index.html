            <div class='col-md body'>well, i was asked twice by RSAF for the seminar, went for one, lots of goodies but didn't go for the 2nd one. They just filter all those with goodeye sight and some other qualities that they want. My friends wear spects also went for the seminar. Think they get the records from ur CMPB check-up bah...<br><br>think carefully, its 12 yrs....no joke. u got to really like the job. as long as u pass N or O level then can liao lah...u dun need to really be educated although they prefer u to be. when i went for the seminar, i was in JC and there are poly people there too.<br><br>u will not always fly, u will be rotated to officejob regularly, dats wat they said during the seminar. then they is UAV 'pilot', fighter pilot and helicopter pilot and etc...</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Well that's a myth propagated by fixed-wing jocks which has been very nicely taken up by the general public.<br><br>Not saying that fixed-wing flying is easy, but flying a helicopter is much more demanding than a plane due to the fact that a helicopter is aerodynamically unstable on all 3 axis (take your hands off the controls for more than a few seconds and you can say bye-bye to stable flight; autopilot notwithstanding). It's another case of comparing apples and oranges, but the actual flying part, IMHO, is more demanding for a helo pilot.<br><br>And yes, there are commercial helo pilot jobs available and I would believe they have it easy since former airforce pilots also have to compete with a huge army of commercial pilots who were never in the airforce.<br><br>Just look how easy it was for the 9/11 hijackers to get flying instructions for commercial flight.   As a civilian, you can get to be a commercial pilot without having to go through the airforce.<br><br>As for airforce pilots, almost everybody wants to be a fighter jock, that's a natural mystique. There is a hierarchy of status within most airforces. Fighter jocks think ground-pounders are fighter washouts. Both think transport pilots are glorified bus drivers. While all think that heli-pilots are a combination of the above. Just let it be known, all of them have a place within the airforce.<br><br>An old A-6 pilot saying -"Fighter pilots make movies.

            <div class='col-md body'>think it is during the medical test at CMPB that they determine whether you can become a Air force pilot..... But he has to go through a stringent of selections and interviews..... If i nv remember wrgly u have to go for a computer test the whole test will take ard 2 hrs.... something quite similar to that that all will do at CMPB..... after that 2 or 3 interviews and lastly medical check up..... all this can be done during his NS liabilities especially during BMT..... of cos last but not least you have to have officer qualities and results must be average Bs and Cs..... in order to become a trainee pilot... the pilot course will take around 3 yrs.....<br><br></div>
