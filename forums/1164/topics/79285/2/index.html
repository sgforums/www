            <div class='col-md body'>It takes awhile for them to process the CPSS, then u gotta wait for them to call you up for the medical, wait for them to give u the results, then wait for them to give u an interview,.... and the waiting doesn't stop there, haha.... wait to go to tamworth, then go ocs, then go to perth for your basic flying..... its a waiting game my friend.... but its worth it in the end..</div>
