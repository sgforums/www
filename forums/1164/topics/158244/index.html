            <div class='col-md body'>Submariners to get service allowances<br><br>KUALA LUMPUR,<br>The Government today announced service allowances of between RM1,100 and RM3,000 a month for Royal Malaysian Navy submariners.<br><br>Submarine trainees will receive a monthly allowance of RM800 if they are officers and RM600 if they are of other ranks.<br><br>Announcing this, Deputy Prime Minister Datuk Seri Najib Razak said the Government approved the incentives recently in view of the importance of maritime safety.<br><br>"The Government hopes this will lift the morale of in the submarine unit," he said, after presenting Hari Raya Puasa goodies to personnel at the Defence Ministry.<br><br>Najib said the ministry had submitted a proposal and the Government approved it after careful study.<br><br>RMN submariners are scheduled to be commissioned in 2008, when the Scorpene submarines commence operations in Ma- laysian waters.<br><br>The commanding officer of the vessel will receive RM3,000 and executive officer RM2,400 in monthly allowance.<br><br>Officers will be paid RM1,900 and other ranking personnel RM1,500 monthly in "expertise allowance". There is a "qualification allowance" of RM1,400 a month for officers and RM1,100 for other ranks.<br><br>Sixty-three submarine trainees, including 31 officers undergoing training in France since late last year, will benefit from incentive allowances, to be backdated to Jan 1 this year.<br><br>Altogether, there will be 156 submarine trainees, including the support force, making up the submarine workforce.<br><br>Trainees will undergo four yearsÂ’ training at the Ma- laysian Submarine School at the DCN Navy Base in Brest, 500km from Paris.<br><br>On another matter, Najib said the armed forcesÂ’ 30-member medical team and six Health Ministry staff will leave for Pakistan tomorrow and on Oct 24 to help in relief efforts following the recent earthquake.<br><br>Both teams will be in Pakistan for three months.<br><br>Najib said the armed forces would build a field hospital in Bagh which is seven hoursÂ’ drive from Islamabad.<br><br>INCENTIVES<br><br>Monthly<br>Comm. Officer: RM3,000<br>Exec. Officer: RM2,400<br><br>Expertise<br>Officers: RM1,900<br>Other ranks: RM1,500<br><br>Qualification<br>Officers: RM1,400<br>Other ranks: RM1,100<br><br>Training<br>Officers: RM800<br>Other ranks: RM600<br><br><strong>Hey. Compare these allowances with RSN's submariners. I think it's a far cry. Commander officer's monthly allowance is RM 3000. That will be about 1800 sg dollars!</strong></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>These r only useful if we use individual escape or rush escape....these r last means of escape where the air in the distress submarine is contianimated or flooding is out of control....these type of escape will usually caused personnel to have decrompession illness or ruptured lung...saw a demo when was in Aus during sub escape trg...where they filled a wine bag ( to show that's ur lung)with air n let it float to surface from depth of 15 metres....below it reaches the surface...the wine bag exploded....<br><br>the preferred resuce method is collective method where the crew wait for rescue vechicle like DSRV or LR5 to come n mate with the sub n rescue the crews to reduced DCI....<br><br>Too bad RSN had no such vechicles n have to wait for our Ally USN to rescue the crew if a distress submarine scenario occurs....by the time they activate USN n to locate the distress sub...the chance of survival is close to zero......</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by xiongzzz:</div><div class="quote_body">The pay of the local submariners are quite untrue lar..<br>it all depends on the qualification of the submariner himself..<br>diploma guys will certainly get more then ppl with ITC ,NTC ,O levels n N levels.. many of the submariner specs are not equip with a diploma, most of them only have O or N levels..<br>so if we compare the pay, a N levels MSG's pay is only slightly higher then a 1SG with diploma provided both getting the same 700 allowance..</div></blockquote>btw salary varies, depending on the education level of the personnel and the SAF oes the same thruoghout in the organisation...<br>The pay i am posting are the pay of a Diploma holder...<br><br>To be selected for Submarine Service, i think you does need to have a good education and many other qualities...<br>Dun forget, u will need to pass the selection and training....<br>I know of 2 submariners and they have diplomas...<br>I don't think there will be any O-level or N-level holders in the submarine service...<br>Maybe you can tell me you know of someone who do... maybe you can intro him to me...<br>A submariner takes on more than 1 vocation in his sub... This is how the manpower requirement is cut down... Education and training is very important...<br>THink in recent 5 yrs back or so, the RSN doesn't takes in N-level student as regulars(sailors) liao... O-levels also not really... There may be exceptions but very very rarely(may be open to those NSFs in RSN), I dun see any of them personally...<br>The RSN is moving towards higher tech and reuiqres personnel with higher level of education....<br><br>NDU is different, they takes in N and O levels as regulars...<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>u know 2 who r diploma holders..<br>so do u know when they went for course?<br>i think the 2 u know most probably have only 7 to 8 years in the navy..<br>those i'm talking abt are those have roughly 9 or more years in the service..<br>MOST importantly, ppl holding only O or N levels doesnt equal to incapability to work or  unable to multi task in the service.. Remember tat the diplomas specs are trained by seniors with O or N levels..<br><br>for ur info, i'm a diploma holder</div>
