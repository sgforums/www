But from now on, the defense industry will emerge as our main export field," Yoon said during a press briefing held in Seongnam, South of seoul, on the eve of the opening of the six-day air show.<br><br>He emphasized that this week's air show will be a good opportunity for Korea to market its weapons.<br><br>"We expect more than $500 million worth of export contracts during the air show," he said.<br><br>Officially named "Korea Aerospace &amp; Defense Exhibition 2007," this year's show brings together 256 defense firms from 26 countries.<br><br>"In particular, only 86 of the participants, or 30 percent, are domestic companies, with the rest coming from foreign nations," said Yoon, formerly an Air Force brigade general.<br><br>Korea has hosted the event, which is becoming Asia's largest defense fair, every two years since 1996.<br><br>To be displayed include the F-15C and F-16C fighter jets and A-10 anti-tank aircraft of the U.S., AH-64 Apache chopper, K-135 tanker, as well as South Korea's F-15K and KF-16 aircraft.</div>

The company sent its two Hawk 128 development aircraft to the UAE for a two-week evaluation during August.<br><br><img src="http://www.flightglobal.com/assets/getAsset.aspx?ItemID=20117"><br><br>The Hawk's rejection comes at an embarrassing time for the company, which will have a large presence at the Dubai show, with the RAF to also deploy its Red Arrows display team to participate in the event.<br><br>The UAE has also assessed the Alenia Aermacchi M-311, Embraer EMB-314 Super Tucano and Pilatus PC-21 for its basic training requirements, but UK Ministry of Defence sources had recently suggested that a selection was not likely to take place until early 2008.<br><br>Read our flight test reports on the M-346 and T-50 trainers.<br><br><a href="http://www.flightglobal.com/articles/2007/10/30/219007/uae-air-force-eliminates-bae-systems-hawk-from-trainer.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.flightglobal.com/articles/2007/10/30/219007/uae-air-force-eliminates-bae-systems-hawk-from-trainer.html</a></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>DATE:22/10/07<br>SOURCE:Flight International<br><br><strong>F/A-50 light combat aircraft project still on hold </strong><br>By Siva Govindasamy<br><br>Korea Aerospace Industries has delayed the submission of a proposal for its F/A-50 light combat version of KAI's T-50 advanced jet trainer by about six months, but the company remains optimistic that it will receive a development contract from the government in 2008.<br><br>KAI says that the proposal is being fine-tuned, and the company must also secure US government approval due to the T-50's use of some sensitive equipment derived from the Lockheed Martin F-16.<br><br>Three test examples of the F/A-50 are likely to be ready by the end of 2007, and the company is hoping for a development contract in 2008. If it gives the nod, the air force is likely to commit to about 60 aircraft for delivery from 2013.<br><br>Alex Jun, KAI's vice-president for marketing, says the government will take care of the F/A-50's development costs while KAI will be prime contractor. The company hopes to fly the first prototype by early 2010 and to complete development work in 2011.<br><br>The programme will sustain the company's T-50 line beyond late 2012, when the last of the air force's A-50s - an attack version of the T-50 - is delivered. KAI will also be hoping to secure export orders for the F/A-50.<br><br>Jun says that the F/A-50 is independent of the proposed KFX fighter programme, which the government is studying to develop a fifth-generation aircraft. "The F/A-50 is a light combat aircraft, while the KFX is a multi-role aircraft. The air force needs both types and we believe that the government be willing to fund both," he says.<br><br>Jun adds: "The F/A-50 is still in the long-term government requirement as a replacement for the [Northrop] F-5s. Some slight delays could be expected as it takes time to finalise the budgetary and technical issues, but we are confident that this will be sorted out soon."<br><br>Other aspects of the programme are moving ahead, with a request for proposals issued for equipment such as radar warning receivers, precision-guided bombs, countermeasures dispensers, datalinks and weapons management systems. Jun could not say which companies had responded, although he adds that the proposals are being studied and the vendors will be chosen in the coming months.<br><br><a href="http://www.flightglobal.com/articles/2007/10/22/218742/fa-50-light-combat-aircraft-project-still-on-hold.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.flightglobal.com/articles/2007/10/22/218742/fa-50-light-combat-aircraft-project-still-on-hold.html</a></div>
