            <div class='col-md body'>,ost of the planes on battleships are sea planes. The only exception i can think of, where a land based aircraft is launched from a ship us from the Doolittle raid where it was a one way ticket.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>During the early part of WW2, a number of transatlantic merchantmen were equipped with catapults that could launch a single land-based Hawker Hurricane fighter. This was in response to the growing threat from German long-range bombers (particularly the FW Condor) that could attack the convoys in the mid-Atlantic, beyond the range of air cover that could be provided by allied fighters from England and eastern seaboard of the US.  The pilot of the Hurricane would bail out and be retrieved after fending off the bombers, since there was no way of landing the fighter.<br><br>This was a stop-gap measure until enough escort carriers were available to accompany the convoys on their tranatlantic crossings.<br><br><a href="http://www.royal-navy.org/mnavy/content/view/5/4/" rel="nofollow">http://www.royal-navy.org/mnavy/content/view/5/4/</a></div>

It was discussed in rec.aviation.military last year.<br><br><a href="http://groups.google.com/group/rec.aviation.military/browse_frm/thread/4a12405aca0ad315/3d79130514433354?lnk=st&amp;q=ar-196+albacore&amp;rnum=1&amp;hl=en#3d79130514433354" rel="nofollow">http://groups.google.com/group/rec.aviation.military/browse_frm/thread/4a12405aca0ad315/3d79130514433354?lnk=st&amp;q=ar-196+albacore&amp;rnum=1&amp;hl=en#3d79130514433354</a><br><br>Dutch light cruisers also carried Fokker C11W floatplanes for over-the-horizon scouting. But in the Battle of Java Sea on the 27th February 1942 they left the floatplanes behind, relying entirely on Surabaya-based Catalina seaplanes for reconnaissance.<br><br>At 1830 the combined ABDA fleet was only 30 miles away from Japanese transports crammed with troops but they didn't know it. At that precise moment Rear Admiral Karel Doorman, commander at sea, actually asked Vice Admiral Helfrich in Surabaya where the Japanese were by radio. Helfrich didn't know where they were either.<br><br>Cheers,<br>Sunho</div>

When the tide turned in the pacific, they indulged in biological agents and tossed up the idea of attacking the western coastal cities of USA via submarine-launched float planes.<br><br>It was rumoured that the Japanese would use a now-primitive kind of mustard gas to shower the population from the sky and inflict maximum damage against a civilian population in the hopes they could use that to barter and sue for peace.<br><br>Not sure whether there is any proof of these theories by the USN though.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Another interesting concept regarding ship-launched seaplanes was also by the Japanese. They converted 2 battleships <span style="font-style: italic;">Ise, Hyuga</span> and the heavy cruiser <span style="font-style: italic;">Mogami</span> into hybrid carriers capable of carrying floatplane/naval dive bombers due to a chronic shortage of carriers after the fiasco at Midway. Both were ready by 1944 but saw little or no action as carriers due to the shortage of planes, pilots and fuel. Few pictures of their hybrid arrangement exist, but here are some line drawings<br><br>Ise/Hyuga<br><img src="http://smmlonline.com/articles/ise/ise06.jpg"><br><br><img src="http://smmlonline.com/articles/ise/ise07.jpg"><br><br>Mogami (painting from Tamiya models)<br><img src="http://i13.photobucket.com/albums/a255/superskyhawk/mogami01.jpg"><br><br>Some info about the hybrids<br><a href="http://smmlonline.com/articles/ise/ise.html" rel="nofollow">http://smmlonline.com/articles/ise/ise.html</a><br><br><a href="http://www.combinedfleet.com/mogami_c.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.combinedfleet.com/mogami_c.htm</a><br></div>
