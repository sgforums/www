            <div class='col-md body'>Hi! Its likely that the differences between all the SpecOps within S'pore is basically their jurisdiction.  All fire arm situations of whatever nature, robbery, kidnapping, high risk arrest, etc, are first responded by the police.<br><br>However, when terrorism is involved, it would depend on the situation &amp; area of attack.  So far, as long as its happening on S'pore's soil, SPF has every jurisdiction to carry out its duties.  But if it occurs on foregin soil( Embassy, other country, etc ), international areas( Changi Airport ), then SAF has jurisdiction upon approval.  Anyway, SPF &amp; SAF work very closely when the situation concerns terrorism.<br><br>STAR team predecessor was known as Police Tactical Unit.  It was disbanded after much controversy.<br><br>Naval Diving Unit has 3 cat of divers; Salvage divers, Underwater Demolition Team( UDT ) &amp; Combat Divers( SpecOps ).  Why does NDU divers the 1 always send to retrive bodies?  Because PCG does not have a diving team yet.<br><br>BTW, some1 mentioned about MP should have a SpecOp team to handle AWOAL.  Well, don't be suprise that they "might" already have but due to jurisdictions, its unlikely we'll ever get to see them.<br><br>Differences between PCG &amp; RSN.  RSN deploy warships whose task are closer to being border patrols while PCGs task are wider, in terms of law enforcing.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Some of you may remember the Channel U mini serial about terrorism.  When they were hunting for terrorists, STAR was sent in. But in the last episode when the terrorist held someone hostage &amp; the HDB flat was stormed, SOF went in. Ok so it was a show but I'm sure there's some realism to it. In this case it was a HDB flat, nothing foreign. But SOF went in.<br><br>As for the difference between RSN &amp; PCG, that we know lah. I'm talking about their counter terrorist units. RSN's NDU has combat divers. PCG has the STS. And SPF's STAR unit also has a naval arm. And all 3 are trained in counter terrorism. So if a seaborne terrorist threat exists, which of the 3 is sent &amp; why?<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hmm! I too have seen that Channel i drama on terrorism.  Anyway the last part of the show where the "SOF" assault a building is actually an abandon school.<br><br>Anyway, it is confusing to indentify as to which SOF is responsible for taking action when terrorism is involve.  However, the point is this, as long as its not on foregin soil or international grounds, SPF STAR team has jurisdiction.  However, if the situation is deem to be beyond the resources of the STAR team, then military SpecOps will take over.<br><br>The reason is simple, for a military SpecOps from whatever country, hostage rescue is a secondary duty while its primary duties remains with whatever military ops is required of them.  Even U.S DELTA Force which was moulded from the Brits SAS is not primarily used for hostage rescue, as evident in the 1st Gulf war where they were used to hunt scuds &amp; carried out recon.<br><br>Same goes for SAF's SpecOps thats why STAR team has every trainning( Sea, Air &amp; Land ) that their military counter-part has, the differences is that SPF does not have all the supporting resources that SAF has.  Also, SPF has 1 major RED TAPE that SAF doesn't, that is the LAW.  Meaning that even in a terrorist ops, STAR Team does not have a shoot to kill rights.  While SAF SpecOps when called upon would mean that they are engaging in WAR which means that they follow the rule of WAR allowing them to kill the enemies before they can react.  Eg, a STAR Team member comes face to face with a terrorist with hostage in hand, the STAR officer can't "actually" immediately put a head shot to the terrorist, especially if the terrorist decide to surrender.  For the military SpecOps, the rules would be different, the terrorist are considered as "enemies".  That is why its tougher to be a STAR Team operator then a military operator.<br><br>So, the thing is this, in peace-time SAF plays a supporting role to SPF which means STAR Team is the advance anti-terror respond party.  Same story goes for PCG &amp; RSN.  However, when it comes to water bound situation, PCG's STS is the advance strike team while SPF is supporting party with RSN being the reserve party.</div>

And it was not that they weren't elite. The main issue was that it was a part time unit. Only when there was an incident then the men get together. STAR however is a full time unit.

            <div class='col-md body'>PTT was indeed a part-time special project detail.  However, they were disbanded after much public controversy.<br><br>Many government agencies were deployed during the SQ117 hijack, including the, (then classified) STAR &amp; EOD, SCDF, etc.  Why was SPF not used in the rescue then?  (1) is that onboard the plane were passengers from various countries, making it an international flight.<br><br>(2) the classification of a terrorist has never been defined that of a robber, kidnapper, rappist, etc.  But they can be class as enemies( foregin ), enemies of the state( domestic ).  This means soldiers can engage them &amp; kill them without the RED TAPE of the Law.  Again, its the reason why its tougher to be a STAR Team, whoses goals are rescue not kill.
