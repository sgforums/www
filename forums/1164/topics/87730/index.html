            <div class='col-md body'>Ok,basically I have got a question for all of you people here.When is the above specified units (SOF,NDU,Police Star and the Police Coast Guard Flying Fish) activated?<br><br>Example,during 1991 a SQ jet was being hijacked,SOF was activated to save the day.However during recent years,there have been several armed robberies,Police Star unit was activated.NDU seems to always be activated when there is a need for the searching of drowned victims etc...and Police Coast Guard Flying Fish unit is activated in the event of drug interdiction,piracy...they are like a SWAT team of the sea.<br><br>You see, the difference is sometimes pretty indistinguishable,so can some one please shed some light?Thanks... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I used to think that STAR was deployed only for serious crimes, while SOF was deployed for terrorist related stuff. But on Crime Watch, it was said that STAR also handles terrorists. So if there's terrorist incident, who gets called &amp; why? SOF? STAR?<br><br>Similarly for the sea. I used to think that STS was called in for serious crimes while NDU is called in for sea borne terrorist threats. But it was said that STS is also trained in counter terrorism. And to complicate matters, STAR also has a naval arm. So if there's a sea borne terrorist threat, who gets called &amp; why? NDU? STS? STAR?<br><br>Good grief!!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"></div>
