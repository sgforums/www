            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote>NEW YORK, Sept 20 (Bernama) -- The United Nations has approved the deployment of 360 Malaysian peacekeepers in Lebanon, Datuk Seri Abdullah Ahmad Badawi disclosed Wednesday.<br><br>The Prime Minister told Malaysian journalists here that the matter was conveyed to him during talks with UN Secretary-General Kofi Annan Tuesday.<br><br>Malaysia, the chairman of the Organisation of the Islamic Conference (OIC), had earlier planned to send 1,000 soldiers to join the UN Interim Force in Lebanon (UNIFIL).<br><br>"They can be deployed any time. And the Ministry of Defence has been informed about the UN decision," he told a press conference on the sidelines of his working visit to New York where he will deliver a speech at the 61st session of the UN General Assembly.<br><br>Abdullah said the UN secretariat would inform Kuala Lumpur if there was a need for additional Malaysian troops.<br><br>"We have stated since the beginning that we are ready to send 1,000 peacekeepers under the UN banner. So, we'll have to wait. If there is a request for more troops, then we will deploy them," he said.<br><br>Israel had earlier resisted the intention of countries which have not recognised it to send peacekeepers to Lebanon to oversee a UN-brokered ceasefire following a 34-day conflict between the Israeli regime and Hizbollah fighters in southern Lebanon.<br><br>Originally, UNIFIL was created by the UN Security Council in 1978 to confirm Israeli withdrawal from Lebanon, restore international peace and security and assist the Lebanese government in restoring effective authority in the area.<br><br>Following the July/August 2006 conflict, the Council decided that in addition to the original mandate, UNIFIL would, among other things, monitor the cessation of hostilities; accompany and support the Lebanese armed forces as they deploy throughout the south of Lebanon; and extend its assistance to help ensure humanitarian access to the civilian population and the voluntary and safe return of displaced persons.<br><br>Abdullah thanked the UN especially Annan for accepting Malaysia's request to send troops to Lebanon where more than 1,000 people died in the Israel-Hizbollah hostilities.<br><br>"And they too appreciate our contribution. Annan expressed gratitude to Malaysia as we have never turned down UN's requests for help to deploy our soldiers to any location in the world. That was what he said and I welcome that statement," he said.<br><br>Abdullah also met a group of American community leaders and non-governmental organisations to discuss with them issues surrounding the gap between Islam and the Western world.<br><br>The prime minister highlighted steps taken by Malaysia to forge understanding between people of different races and religions against the backdrop of tensions among societies in many other countries.<br><br>"They said Malaysia's experience was good to study and adopt to suit the needs of countries wishing to resolve problems related to race and religion," he said.<br><br>Abdullah also met former United States President Bill Clinton where discussions focused on similar themes.<br><br>On his meeting with the Asean-US Business Council, he said those present expressed commitment to Malaysia knowing that the country had announced a slew of plans to bring the economy and development to greater heights.<br><br>"They also appreciate the government's decision to lower corporate tax," he said, alluding to the Budget 2007's proposal to reduce corporate tax from the current 28 per cent to 27 per cent in 2007 and 26 per cent in 2008.<br><br>Abdullah, who is Finance Minister, also told those present that negotiations over the proposed Malaysia-US free trade agreement were still on-going.<br><br>Asked about his impression of the speech delivered by US President George W. Bush at the UN General Assembly on Tuesday, he said Bush reiterated the American position on global issues such as the Middle East and Darfur.<br><br>"It's true that he wants things resolved but further efforts must be undertaken to realise that goal," he added.<br><br>-- BERNAMA </blockquote><a href="http://www.pmo.gov.my/website/webdb.nsf/vALLDOC/55159D08B011BA4A482571EF0033C22E" rel="nofollow">http://www.pmo.gov.my/website/webdb.nsf/vALLDOC/55159D08B011BA4A482571EF0033C22E</a><br><br>They get paid for sending troops on UN missions right?<br></div>
