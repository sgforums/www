            <div class='col-md body'>FRENCH PRESS: French Govt Mulls Selling Jets To Singapore<br><br>PARIS (Dow Jones)--The French defense procurement agency DGA, about to order 59 Rafale fighter aircraft from Dassault Aviation (12172.FR), is considering re-selling 8 jets to Singapore, La Tribune reports Friday without citing sources.<br><br>Singapore is reviewing proposals from several suppliers, including Dassault and Boeing Co. (BA) to acquire combat planes. The proposed indirect agreement would allow Dassault and its partners to develop additional equipment such as a new radar, La Tribune says.<br><br>(Taken from Alert 5)<br><br>Sounds interesting eh..Have we finally decided on out NGF?Is this verifiable?</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Why would RSAF buy those 8 Rafales from FAF, when RSAF is still reviewing the 3 finalists?<br><br>I would think that if RSAF really does buy those 8 Rafales, then its a clear sign that they have decided on Rafale. I seriously doubt they would buy these 8 Rafales &amp; then later announce they have chosen Eurofighter for e.g. Then what are they gonna do with these 8 Rafales? After all, RSAF has already indicated that inventually they are gonna just operate 2 types of fighter jets.<br><br>Anyway, it was an unnamed source, so its still rather dubious as to how accurate it is.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"></div>

It could be that the Russians are not reliable in providing logistical support in the long run, they do not share the level of technology as the other companies are willilng to and definately, they do not provide the type of training Singapore want.<br><br>I think all six planes were choosen for their capability and their relevence to our need, then the planes were slowly axed after MINDEF consider logistical, training and technological issues. In my opinion as what DSTA had hinted before, MINDEF is considering the last 3 planes primarily on technology and future collaborations.</div>

We need an aircraft which is much capable than the F-16E/F but because of our cost saving policy, NGF still have to be multirole. However that is not a problem because the global figther design trend is shifting towards producing multiple role fighters rather than being specific. Unlike the past where multiple role fighters are jack of all trade, master of none, current multiple role fighters can rule the sky.<br><br>I think the SU-30MK(?) should be a benchmark for us. Our NGF must be able to deal with the SU-30 in air to air combat and exceed it in air to ground capabilities. If not, i dont think our purchase is worthwhile.</div>

They do not only go for mud movers.<br><br>Even the Australians are worried about the growing capabilities of the region's air forces. Technology to technology, our F-16C/D is at great disadvantage if  compare with the SU-30MKM/MKI/MKK(?). I do not see that our NGF have to completely fill up the strike gap by the A-4SU, our F-16D can do the job pretty well.

As i say, there is no way our F-16 by technology (ceteris paribus) can have advantage over the SU-30MK(/) thus im not convince that they are just merely going for strike. While the Australians in this region is frantic about losing gradually their air superiority position, i bet Singapore is worry too.<br><br>In fact, the Typhoon and the F-15T with the AESA are primarily designed for air superiority roles with of course good strike capability.<br></div>
