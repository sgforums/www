            <div class='col-md body'>If our neighbour have nukes ... ahh<br><br>It rather depends, if that country is in good terms with US then, then they are a responsible nuclear partner, else they are a world threat. If we then decide to have a nukes, and is not in US interest, then we will be sauntioned and invaded.  It seems it all depends on US POV.<br><br>On Iran, whether or not they have a nuclear weapons program, is something nobody has proof, even IAEA inspectors say they don't, until the usual US influence and baseless accusations says they have. I'm surprise that many of you are still blind after the Lies and deception being employed in the Iraqi War.<br><br>A short history, Iran volunteered IAEA inspection, They have not broken any NPT rules, They are entiltled to Uranium Enrichment as other countries, The IAEA has said there are no Nuclear Weapons program , The Russians (Supplier and Builder) says the same. The present Iran 3% purity enrichment cannot make nukes which required &lt;90% purity. 3% enrichment can be made even in any top University. Presently Iran has 1500 contrifuges, and they need 150,000 contrifuge to sufficently refine weapons grade fuel. In 1950s, under the Shah, US has wanted build Nuclaer plants in Iran.<br><br>If today, you ask any US representatives, Do they have proof ? They will side step your question and intimidate you.. just like they did to the Newsweek reporter.. of course.. the US's freedom of press do not report anything that's not in-line with US policies. In fact, Last year they tried to pull a "Forged Nigerian yellow Cake" on the world by producing a S0-called "Stolen" Iranian Laptop with Nuclear warhead Program, a very badly done. If this laptop is so reliable why has it been shelved and never heard of again ?<br><br>In fact, under the PNAC, 8 Years ago. The US has planned to take control of the ME, Aghanistan, Iraq and Iran, to control the World's oil supplies - to control the World. Agfhanistan and Iraq is done... now it's Iran turn, then China is up next. Of course, things didn't turn out as they wish... now Iran is about to open the Oil bourse to accept Euro.... They will be bombed regardless. just like Iraq.<br><br>So Peeps wake up, and read foreign AP news, instead of Straits Times, and watch CNN, FOX and CNA. I have discovered that SG news media are US leaning and only report watered down reports. The Cheney's garb on Russian and Putin's response was half censored in the Straits Times... many things were not reported.. including Bush admission that Iraq has no WMD(nuclear) and was not involved with 9/11.</div>
