Since we do not have full size Infantry Divisions or Armoured Divisions, it is not practical to include a Regiment-level in our command structure.<br><br>So, our Army now goes from Battalion to Brigade, where a Brigade consists or 3 Battalions. Our Regimental HQs (aka Formation HQs) have become Functional Groups which focus solely on practical matters and doctrine.<br><br>I guess it sounds pretty confusing right?<br>It'll sound more complex when the next round of Combined Arms initiatives are implemented.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>This is how I understand it:<br><br>My guess is that in the old days, the term "Regiment" in SIR denoted a specific size of a unit.<br><br>So 1SIR really meant 1st Singapore Infantry Regiment, 2SIR meant 2nd Infantry regiment and so on. And in the old days we literally only had a couple of regiments.<br><br>But these days, 1SIR means 1st Battalion of the Singapore Infantry Regiment. 2SIR means 2nd Battalion of the same Singapore Infantry Regiment.<br><br>So how big is a "Regiment" in Singapore?<br><br>My guess is that the "Regiment" no longer denotes a particular size. It is merely some nostalgic hold on tradition to keep using the term "SIR" for our units.<br><br>The term "Singapore Infantry Regiment" is more like the family surname and doesn't denote a specific strength. So every battalion in Singapore - irregardless of which Brigade or Division - is a part of the BIG Singapore Infantry Regiment family.</div>
