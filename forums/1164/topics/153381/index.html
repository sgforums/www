            <div class='col-md body'><strong>SU-47 (S-37) BERKUT EXPERIMENTAL FIGHTER AIRCRAFT, RUSSIA</strong><br><br>The Sukhoi Design Bureau of Moscow, Russia has developed the Su-47 (previously called the S-37 Berkut or Golden Eagle) fighter aircraft, which first flew in September 1997. Su-47 is in a forward swept wing configuration and uses a highly unstable triplane (with three main lifting surfaces) aerodynamic configuration. The Su-47 completed the first stage of flight trials in December 2001. In May 2002, Sukhoi was selected as prime contractor for the next-generation Russian PAK FA fighter programme. The PAK FA will be a development of the Su-47 but without the forward swept wings.<br><br>The design of the very high manoeuvrability prototype is based on the avionics and aerodynamics technologies developed for the Su-27 upgrade programme. Some of the systems and component designs from the Su-27, (the all weather supersonic fighter aircraft with NATO reporting name Flanker), have been used in the Su-47, for example the design of the canopy, landing gear, some of the avionics and the near-vertical tails</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>MANOEUVRABILITY</strong><br><br>The Su-47 has extremely high agility at subsonic speeds enabling the aircraft to alter its angle of attack and its flight path very quickly, and it also retains manoeuvrability in supersonic flight.<br><br>Maximum turn rates and the upper and lower limits on air speed for weapon launch are important criteria in terms of combat superiority. The Su-47 aircraft has very high levels of manoeuvrability with maintained stability and controllability at all angles of attack.<br><br>Maximum turn rates are important in close combat and also at medium and long range, when the mission may involve engaging consecutive targets in different sectors of the airspace. A high turn rate of the Su-47 allows the pilot to turn the fighter aircraft quickly towards the next target to initiate the weapon launch.<br><br>The swept-forward wing, compared to a swept-back wing of the same area, provides a number of advantages: higher lift to drag ratio; higher capacity in dogfight manoeuvres; higher range at subsonic speed; improved stall resistance and anti-spin characteristics; improved stability at high angles of attack; a lower minimum flight speed; and a shorter take-off and landing distance.<br><br><strong>FUSELAGE</strong><br><br>The Su-47 fuselage is oval in cross section and the airframe is constructed mainly of aluminium and titanium alloys and 13 per cent by weight of composite materials.<br><br>The nose radome is slightly flattened at the fore section and has a horizontal edge to optimise the aircraft's anti-spin characteristics.<br><br><strong>WINGS</strong><br><br>The forward swept midwing gives the unusual and characteristic appearance of the Su-47. A substantial part of the lift generated by the forward-swept wing occurs at the inner portion of the wingspan. The lift is not restricted by wingtip stall. The ailerons - the wing's control surfaces - remain effective at the highest angles of attack, and controllability of the aircraft is retained even in the event of airflow separating from the remainder of the wings' surface.<br><br>The wing panels of the Su-47 are constructed of nearly 90% composites. The forward-swept midwing has a high aspect ratio, which contributes to long-range performance. The leading-edge root extensions blend smoothly to the wing panels, which are fitted with deflectable slats on the leading edge; flaps and ailerons on the trailing edge.<br><br>The all-moving and small-area trapezoidal canards are connected to the leading-edge root extensions.<br><br><strong>COCKPIT</strong><br><br>The cockpit's design has focused on maintaining a high degree of comfort for the pilot and also on the pilot being able to control the aircraft in extremely high G-load manoeuvres. The aircraft is equipped with a new ejection seat and life support system. The variable geometry adaptive ejection seat is inclined at an angle of 60Â°, which reduces the impact of high G forces on the pilot. The seat allows dogfight manoeuvres with significantly higher G loadings than can normally be tolerated by the pilot.<br><br>The pilot uses a side-mounted, low-travel control stick and a tensometric throttle control.<br><br><strong>LANDING GEAR</strong><br><br>The aircraft uses a retractable tricycle-type landing gear with a single wheel at each unit. The smaller nose wheel retracts towards the rear and the two mainwheels retract forward into the wing roots.<br><br><a href="http://www.airforce-technology.com/projects/s37/" rel="nofollow">http://www.airforce-technology.com/projects/s37/</a></div>
