Our fighters will be able to use their engine to get out of range before they can even shoot.<br><br>With our current SAF if go back in time, are more than able to fence off any japan WWII type of army. They cannot do a navy attack, as their fleet will be long spotted and knock out by our navy and RSAF.

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by Asiaspin:</div><div class="quote_body">Think there was a movie that set a modern US aircraft carrier against the Japanese in the 2nd world war due to some freak experiment concerning time travelling.<br><br>Imagine if our whole nation is transported back some 50+ years back and we face a coming Japanese attack. Are our moden army able to trash these invaders easily with our F16, F5, M16, and newer tanks etc.? Or are we gonna to chicken out??? Or are we gonna run out of ammunitions?</div></blockquote>The movie talked about one modern US carrier being brought back in time to the pacific ocean, just when the japanese naval task force was approaching Pearl Harbour. Planes from the carrier encountered two Jap fighters and shot them down, saving a US senator who was fishing around the area in his own boat. Just when the carrier commander decided to launch attack on the Jap fleet, which mean history will be changed, it was brought back to present time.<br><br>In the movie, it was a complete aircraft carrier that went back in time. A US aircraft carrier can sustain itself in any combat situation anywhere. For SAF planes to sustain any combat, they need the base. So, unless the whole Singapore also went back in time, the F16 can only launch one attack and then fly back to the airports in Singapore 50 years ago. Are the runways long enough, was there Tengah airbase?<br><br>If Singapore, as a whole country went back in time, haha, not only the Japanese would be in for big surprise. Just imagine the British colonial ruler, whatever his name, woke up in the morning and found GCT or LHL telling him, "hey, move aside, we are now independent and we are taking over."<br><br>Under that circumstance, it would not be difficult for SAF to take out the invaders. None of the Jap ships that raided Pearl Harbour came near Singapore. They remained in the pacific and finaly sunk in the battle for midway. The few brigades who came to singapore would be crushed without any problem. Few Japanese tanks were used in the invasion of Singapore.<br><br>Even their campaigns in the Philippines were small involving only a few divisions, which I believe SAF can handle without any problem. The question is, can SAF engage the Japanese in China, where the major battles were fought by the Japanese Imperial Army?<br><br>Is SAF equipped to fight in distant land? can SAF fight in the cold winter of China, against the Japanese? That I am not sure. The German, despite their superior weapons against the Soviets, were frozen and lost the war in WW2.<br><br>This remain a theoretical paper discussion.<br><br></div>
