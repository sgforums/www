However, we have to keep in mind that no matter what, small steps are small steps. It's the extent of exerting a greater strategic role within the region that is of concern to me.<br><br>But then again, maybe my concerns are unwarranted. I highly doubt between Singapore, Indonesia and Malaysia, nobody is seriously intent on starting any conflict. All bark and no bite for all three states - alot like our vaunted SAF. This region hasn't seen open conflict for four decades and I don't see it occuring anytime soon, especially now there is greater consciousness regarding the importance of regional economic integration.<br><br>So my message to military nuts here is we don't need to get excited and up in arms, pardon the pun, over every military deal in the region. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Indonesia's territorial defense is rooted in General Nasution's concept of Total People's Defence. I hope people understand this concept well and observe how post colonial Indonesia has been shaped by a central military axis that dominates Indonesian society.

To invade the Vatican you would have to invade Italy first.  No way you can reach Vatican &amp; not have to deal with the Italian armed forces.<br><br>Brunei is NOT in Singapore.  You do not need to invade S'pore to get to Brunei, you can get them direct.  Firstly, I doubt S'pore is going to send its troops to fight for another country.  As it is we might not even have enough manpower to defend our own country if a prolonged war breaks out.  What makes you think we are going to sacrifice our already minute army?  Secondly, even if they do, by the time they reach Brunei, it would have been over run already.<br><br></div></blockquote>You left out the part where the Vatican state is protected by the Swiss.
