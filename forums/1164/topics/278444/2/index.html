FYI, the so called "security guard'' are actually the Swiss Guards that has been protecting the Vatican for the past thousand years or so..the link here is more than a church and it's security guards<br><br>Symbolic?i would beg to differ on that too. The Vatican is an official state that has been in existence for the past two thousand years and only the Japanese can claim to have a longer history than the Vatican. In the peak of it's power, the Vatican and it's clergymen controlled large tracts of land in Europe. It would be dangerous to say that their independence is symbolic because in Europe, they have many states that are shaped in the mould of the Vatican and to make the assumption that their independence are symbolic is pretty shallow. I would think that puppet states such as Manchukuo and Vichy France are more suited to this description.<br><br>About the last point, over here in Singapore, are we any better. We are basically the size of a small town and not because of government policies , we will still be pretty much a sleepy backwater in South East Asia. Does it make it ridiculous for Singapore to be described as a state?? The determinant of statehood are more than the size and system of the sate, it is the influence and respect that one gets from the international community that determine the prowess of your state. You can assume that excluding nuclear weapon in it's agenda, the North Korean would not even have the influence 1/10 the influence the Vatican has on the international stage. </blockquote></div>

Heck I got to bring passport just to eat seafood in JB.<br><br>I know the Swiss Guards have firearms. There was even a shooting incident inside the Vatican. So what, a few assault rifles and pistols makes you a country?<br><br>There are hotels in the US just as well-armed.<br><br>The Peninsula Hotel Beverly Hills where I stayed, i see them jogging in formation in the morning packing heat in their shoulder holsters. Does that make the the Peninsula Hotel a country?<br><br>...<br><br>What's wrong with the statement 'Vatican's independence is symbolic"? A symbol can last thousands of years, something real and material can be broken overnight. A symbol is always held in higher esteem than something real and material. People who seek immortality will try to turn themselves, or their achievements, into something symbolic.<br><br>But if you want to insist the Vatican IS a country, HAS the infrastructure of a country - JUST like Brunei - sorry... you have to be pretty thick and need help more than wiki can provide.<br><br>It may have been like a country hundreds of years ago, today it is a small area in Rome. PERIOD.<br><br>But anyway, mozzi already said he is joking about bring up the comparison between the Vatican and Brunei, so let's drop this religious topic.</div></blockquote>As i have said earlier on, the determinant of a nation statehood is not it's size or the number of troops it has.<br><br>The Vatican is defined as a land locked city state and the smallest INDEPENDENT state in the world. The papel state has a working administration and a full fledge political system.  They also conduct their own foreign relation with the Pope conducting the relation on behalf on the Vatican thus, as Wiki quotes....<br><br>''Given the distinction between the two entities, the Holy See's immense influence on world affairs is quite unrelated to the minuscule size of the Vatican City State"<br><br>Thus, i don't see in anyway how the Vatican resembles a "state with symbolic indepedence". I thought for a person that have been to the Vatican, you would have understood more about the Vatican than most people, but i can't really see any understanding.sorry!!</div>
