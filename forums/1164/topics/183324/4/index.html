            <div class='col-md body'>actually sometime I feel it makes more sense to buy off the shelve than upgrade.<br><br>see, when you upgrade nobody knows what you upgraded it with unlike when you buy but everything has it's limits, maybe on a beetle VW you can rip out the back seats and expand the fuel tank or maybe add better suspension to it put in an expensive nakamichi sound system to it to make it more modern but you cannot make an old VW beetle run as fast as a ferrari, it's just not possible because physically it's so small, you try to put a bigger engine in it may not fit or may not move because it will be heavier or is not the right balance so you get performance issues....  so you can only work within what you already have and not more.<br><br>Even an old sub like the sjoorman you can only upgrade within it's limits and only to what you want provided if you also have the technology and your own people who know how to do this upgrading. If you don't have either then you just wishful thinking and you got nuts.<br><br>buying on the other hand, anybody can go to the shipbuilder website and view the product specs and know roughly what you got. But it means you don't have to worry abt developing capability yourself, you buying it with money. Developing capability will take years of R&amp;D and may cost more than buying off the shelf and you not achieve it in the end also.<br><br>so there's good and bad tradeoffs. Personally I prefer if we just buy it.</div>
