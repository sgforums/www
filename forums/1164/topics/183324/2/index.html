            <div class='col-md body'>Allow me to explain. Diesel electric submarines don't run on electricity all the time and when the batteries ran out the diesel engines will kick in to recharge these batteries when surfaced. These submarines will run on electric power only when underwater where there is no air for the diesel engines. When travelling with electric power, its much more quiet thus minimising detection by passive sonar. In the case of vehicles since supply of air is not an issue the batteries can be charged whenever the diesel engine is running, much like your normal car batteries but with much more stored power.<br><br>What i am proposing is that the vehicle can switch to electric power when carrying out the initial phase of a surprise attack to minimise noise but will switch back to diesel power when the element of surprise is lost and when greater speed and power is required during fighting.<br><br>The technology for hybrid engine cars is matured and these cars are already out in the market so the prospect of having hybrid engine armoured vehicles may not be that remote a possibility.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"></div>

Hybrid engine technology also have the diesel component in it without which the system can't function at all. Recharging of batteries in combat is also not a problem because the batteries will be recharged simultaneously when the diesel engine is running. Diesel engine will be used most of the time, electric power will only kick in when stealth is needed such as when advancing slowly up to the enemy in urban terrain during a surprise dawn attack. At this initial stage,speed and power is not that crucial.<br><br>However, i do agree with you that the size of batteries required to move such a big vehicle may be too big to render such an idea feasible. The hybrid engine technology to move an armoured vehicle is simply not matured at the moment, more research and development is thus required.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"><br><br>ps I think we shouldn't dwell too much into this after all this is just a personal proposal by me and not directly related to the topic per se</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>tankee, i believe we read the same book once before. hahah.<br><br>Basically, its not impossible to create a battery powered version of the terrex that uses its diesel engine to charge power.  There are already such vehicles that uses solar power etc to recharge its batteries.  On a vehicles like the terrex, u have even more room to house more efficient batteries.<br><br>Ideally, in battery mode, it would allow the vehicle to accelerate much faster, since a battery can provide power on demand.  No need for gears and transmissions etc.  But those would be in place for it to operate in more conventional means lar.<br><br>Perhaps a kinda Armored SOF squad can make use of such equipment.  The vehicles operating in groups of 4.   1 Command Vehicle, 2 Weapons veh (heavy weaponry, 25mm + atgw or mortar) + 1 Personnel transport veh.  We are looking at something very futuristic.  Because it can run on battery, it would reduce vehicle heat signatures, and its approach to a target area can be very quiet.<br><br>Command vehicle, where the commander and surveillance team would be in would deploy mini-UAVs to recce the strike area.  Providing targeting and real time updates to the dismounted SOF squads on the ground.  Squads would then use the information from the mini UAVs to conduct their strikes.  Remaining 2 weapons vehicles are to provide fire support to the squads.  The mortar would be able to fire low-velocity guided munitions on targets designated by the mini-UAVs or the squads on the ground.<br><br>Futuristic unconventional warfare. =D</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I notice that lionnoisy states that the number is quoted from ADJ. I really doubt the number to be so high. I also read ADJ  and the impression they give is their info is sometimes rubbish and bullshit.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>A battery-powered IFV is entirely possible - technically.<br><br>During one of my school holiday jobs - ions ago - I worked at a warehouse and they had they eletric-powered jack-lift vehicles. They were real fast and real quiet, and very powerful. Of course they are not as powerful as the diesel ones, but I believe it can be done.<br><br>There are already dual power cars - but electric and diesel. So it is another fact that points towards hybrid power IFV being entirely possible.<br><br>But, the question is this: How important is this steath factor in a IFV? Is stealth important enough to make sacrifices... eg less armour due to weight and size of a massive and potentially troublesome hybrid engine pack?</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>well, from what i see, stealth is really an essential item for the IFV but not worth the sacrifice in terms of amour and survivablitily on the battlefield. As one would probably note, stealth is virtually worth next to nothing in a Gung - Ho dogfight. So yea, it'll be nice if one can strike a balance between Stealth and the other factors itself  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"><br><br>Edit: or failing to do so, at least turn the IFV into something that can outshoot whatever the enemy can throw at it  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"></div>
