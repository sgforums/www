              <p>SAF is not just for defense!!RSAF can fly to their capitals and intercept their fleeing</p>
              <p>VIPs!!We know the home adddresses  of their VIP.We will find out their safe houses.</p>
              <p>SG sensors,human or non--human,can provide useful clues of</p>

              <p>I have no doubt they can fire their first rounds.But how about the next rounds?</p>

              <p>Good.</p>
              <p>This is the main differences between a country serious in defense and another</p>
              <p>not so serious.</p>
              <p>I think at the most one of them not in service,eg in dry dock for repair or maintenance.</p>
              <p>All platforms are procured for actions,not sitting in docks or warhouses</p>
              <p>for what ever reasons,eg machines not workable,shortage of man powers etc.</p>

              <p>well. starlight equipment would be practically unable to be used in case of attack from the north...</p>
              <p>a) the idea of equipment coming from taiwan might place them in a sticky situation </p>
              <p>b) since in order to come from that direction, travel through their waters would be neccesary, and would place these assets under huge risk of being shot and sunk. believe assets (ground esp) overseas are more under training purpose, rather than for combat, to be used only in dire straits, (you still need stuff for your troops to train on overseas wad)</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>however, if (a) can be ignored, the prescence of assets and associated materiel at starlight would place the SAF in a strategic position to be a transit point for additional assets coming from other detachments overseas, in effect acting as a stopover as part of a pipeline ferrying assets back to spore.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>so basically, i think that equipment at starlight is mainly an issue at economics, rather than get the units to bring their own heavies everywhere, preposition them.</p>

              <p>i went on holiday to taiwan last year.</p>
              <p>according to my taiwanese tour guide, they have hosted several detachments of RSAF personnel for R&amp;R at Hualien Airbase before.</p>
              <p>but how accurate and how informed is this i aint sure.</p>
              <p>in any case, Hualien is a most beautiful county. Taiwan Ups lah. if there's one country ild seriouslly consider retiring in, ild definitely do it in taiwan.</p>

              <p>i went on holiday to taiwan last year.</p>
              <p>according to my taiwanese tour guide, they have hosted several

              before.</p>
              <p>but how accurate and how informed is this i aint sure.</p>
              <p>in any case, Hualien is a most beautiful county. Taiwan Ups lah.
              if there's one country ild seriouslly consider retiring in, ild
              definitely do it in taiwan.</p>
