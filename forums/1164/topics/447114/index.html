              <h3>Singapore Seeks Tankers, Tranports, ASW</h3>
              <p><a href="http://www.aviationweek.com/aw/generic/story.jsp?id=news/dti/2012/02/01/DT_02_01_2012_p23-414017.xml&amp;headline=Singapore%20Seeks%20Tankers,%20Tranports,%20ASW&amp;channel=defense">http://www.aviationweek.com/aw/generic/story.jsp?id=news/dti/2012/02/01/DT_02_01_2012_p23-414017.xml&amp;headline=Singapore%20Seeks%20Tankers,%20Tranports,%20ASW&amp;channel=defense</a></p>
              <p>Airbus Military could be one of the main beneficiaries of the 
              Singapore air force’s next round of procurements. Singapore has at the 
              top of its procurement list aerial refueling tankers, strategic 
              airlifters and anti-submarine warfare fixed-wing aircraft, purchases 
              that will see that the island continues to be, for the next few years at
               least, the biggest spender on new defense equipment in Southeast Asia.</p>
              <p>The 2011 defense budget was SG$12.1 billion ($9.6 
              billion), accounting for 26% of the government budget and about 5% of 
              gross domestic product (GDP). Some  analysts estimate that Singapore, 
              with a population of about five million, spends more on defense per 
              capita than any country but Israel.</p>
              <p>Defense has always been a top priority, ever since 
              Singapore gained independence in 1965. The nation’s founder, Lee Kwan 
              Yew, recently said in the book Hard Truths, that “without a strong 
              defense, there will be no Singapore. It will become a satellite, cowed 
              and intimidated by its neighbors.”</p>
              <p>Singapore has close defense ties with Israel, a point 
              that is downplayed—because it is politically sensitive—but one that is 
              important to remember because it explains why Israeli companies are 
              short-listed by the Singaporeans for upcoming defense purchases. The  
              Israelis are in the running to supply aerial refueling tankers and 
              anti-submarine warfare fixed-wing aircraft.</p>
              <p>Aerial refueling tankers are at the top of the list 
              because the air force needs to replace its four Boeing KC-135Rs. An 
              important requirement is that the new tankers be able to assist the air 
              force’s Boeing F-15SGs flying between Singapore and its overseas 
              detachment at Mountain Home AFB, Idaho.</p>
              <p>The Boeing KC-46A would ordinarily be the front-runner 
              but Boeing may have to struggle to win the Singapore contract. The 
              manufacturer is already committed to deliver 18 KC-46As to the U.S. Air 
              Force by 2017, leaving no early delivery slots for foreign customers. A 
              Boeing official told Aviation Week in July 2011 that it can deliver 
              KC-46As to foreign customers as early as 2018. But that may be too late 
              for Singapore. Industry executives say Singapore’s air force has been 
              complaining about the difficulty and cost of maintaining the aging 
              KC-135Rs. But the need to secure aerial refueling tankers sooner rather 
              than later creates an opportunity for Israel Aerospace Industries (IAI),
               which converts 767s to tankers.</p>
              <p>However, industry executives familiar with the situation 
              say the front-runner in this competition is the Airbus Military A330 
              Multi-Role Tanker Transport (MRTT). Australian air force officials told 
              DTI at the LIMA air show in Malaysia in December that the Singapore air 
              force was interested in the A330MRTT and that the organizers of the 
              Singapore air show were pushing to have a Royal Australian Air Force 
              (RAAF) tanker on display there. The RAAF, however, has declined the 
              request. They say the only reason the A330MRTT was brought to LIMA was 
              because it had to be in Malaysia for a joint military exercise.</p>
              <p>Singapore Technologies Aerospace, the Singapore 
              government-linked company that maintains many of the air force’s 
              aircraft, is also familiar with the A330, because it does the heavy 
              maintenance work on Singapore Airlines’ (SIA) fleet of leased A330 
              passenger aircraft.</p>
              <p>The A330MRTT’s 111,000 kg (245,000 lb.) of fuel is stored
               in the wings and horizontal stabilizer, leaving the main fuselage for a
               passenger cabin that can seat up to 380 people. In terms of air cargo, 
              it can transport up to 26 military cargo pallets.</p>
              <p>Having the ability to transport passengers and cargo on a
               longer-range aircraft, such as the A330MRTT, would certainly be useful.
               Airlift is one of the other requirements Singapore lists. Presently the
               air force operates five Lockheed Martin C-130Hs, aircraft that only 
              have the range to travel within Southeast Asia. But Singapore’s military
               needs to carry personnel and equipment farther afield to places where 
              it does training, namely: Australia, Taiwan, France and the U.S. 
              Singapore’s military has been chartering commercial aircraft from SIA 
              and for military equipment it has been chartering Antonov heavy-lift 
              aircraft. It is understood that Singapore is also considering the Airbus
               Military A400M and the Boeing C-17.</p>
              <p>Besides strategic airlift and aerial refueling tankers, 
              Singapore has a requirement for fixed-wing aircraft for anti-submarine 
              warfare (ASW). These may end up replacing the air force’s nine Fokker 50
               maritime patrol aircraft, according to some industry executives. This 
              procurement is in response to the growth of submarine fleets among 
              Singapore’s neighbors. ASW contenders include the Alenia ATR 42MP, 
              Boeing P-8A Poseidon and an IAI/Elta Systems offering, which uses a 
              Bombardier Q400. The Lockheed Martin P-3C was being considered but is no
               longer in the running.</p>
              <p>Not to be forgotten among the airlift, aerial refueling 
              and anti-sub acquisition extravaganza are fighters. Singapore is 
              expected to take interest in Tokyo’s recent decision to choose the 
              Lockheed F-35 Joint Strike Fighter. Like Israel, Singapore and the U.S. 
              enjoy close military relations. Indeed, according to a December 2011 
              report by the Congressional Research Service on U.S. Foreign Military 
              Sales (FMS), Singapore’s agreement for $530 million worth of FMS placed 
              it in the top 10 leading purchasers of U.S. defense articles and 
              services in 2010 worldwide.</p>
              <p>And Singapore’s interests extend elsewhere, too. It has 
              explored the option of using the smaller catapult-launched Boeing 
              ScanEagle UAV on-board its vessels. Anti-piracy concerns remain another 
              driving force behind military acquisitions.</p>

              <h3 class="post-title entry-title">Singapore's Defence Budget for Financial Year 2012/13</h3>
              <p><a href="http://kementah.blogspot.com/2012/02/singapores-defence-budget-for-financial.html">http://kementah.blogspot.com/2012/02/singapores-defence-budget-for-financial.html</a></p>
              <p>One of the biggest highlights for defence professionals arriving this 
              weekend for the Singapore Airshow will take place far from the show 
              venue in Changi.<br> <br> The reading of Singapore's Budget Statement this coming Friday (17 Feb 
              2012) will be keenly watched by the city state's friends and frenemies.</p>
              <div style="text-align: left;">From an information management 
              standpoint, timing is perfect. Releasing the Budget Statement when key 
              defence professionals from around the world are still in town ensures 
              defence watchers will be better appraised on the value, focus and 
              national priorities for Singapore in the 2012/13 financial year. This 
              kicks off from 1 April.</div>
              <p><br> Defence hacks bombed out by five days of intensive coverage at the 
              airshow (Monday's press preview plus four Trade Days) will have a 
              ready-made story on the Lion City's defence posture just by looking at 
              the Defence budget figure. As news flows tend to dry up on the last 
              Trade Day of the Sing Airshow, having this big story delivered on their 
              plate helps scribes justify their presence in sunny Singapore when most 
              of Europe is locked in the big freeze. <br> <br> <strong>Underlining commitment to defence</strong><br> Armed with this information, word of Singapore's commitment to its 
              national defence will spread far and wide as Singapore Airshow delegates
               pack up and head for home. The value of such awareness, whispered in 
              the corridors of Kementah in Kuala Lumpur, the Pentagon, MODUK and 
              elsewhere will do much to sell the message that Singapore is serious 
              about protecting its national interests.   <br> <br> So com<span style="font-family: inherit;">e Friday, it's a safe bet that
               many plasma TV sets in the swanky chalets that ring the airshow will be
               tuned to the "live" broadcast of Singaporean Deputy Prime Minister and 
              Minister for Finance, Tharman Shanmugarat</span><span style="color: #222222; font-family: inherit;"><span style="line-height: 16px;"><span style="font-family: inherit;">nam, unveiling</span> the Singaporean government's proposed fiscal priorities and allocations.</span></span><br> <br> <span style="color: #222222; line-height: 16px;">For the Singapore Airshow crowd, one highly anticipated budget item is the value of the Defence budget.</span><span style="color: #222222; line-height: 16px;"><br> </span><br> <span style="color: #222222; line-height: 16px;">For regular visitors to
               this blog, no surprises are likely when it comes to defence spending. 
              Indeed, it would be news to us if the Singaporean Ministry of Defence 
              (MINDEF) had its budget clipped from the S$12.08 billion budgeted for 
              national defence in FY 2011/12. The figure for FY 2010/11 amounted to 
              some S$11.46 billion</span><br> <span style="color: #222222; line-height: 16px;"><br> </span><br> <span style="color: #222222; line-height: 16px;">Singapore Airshow 
              delegates from overseas bemoaning the strength of the Singapore dollar 
              vis-a-vis their home currencies will realise the sum for MINDEF/SAF is a
               hefty commitment by this tiny nation.</span><br> <span style="color: #222222; line-height: 16px;"><br> </span><br> <span style="color: #222222; line-height: 16px;">Defence spending is 
              likely to claim the lion's share of national spending (30% of the 
              national budget) because Singapore has made it abundantly clear a feast 
              or famine approach to defence spending is not the way to guarantee the 
              island's security.</span><br> <span style="color: #222222;"></span><br> <span style="color: #222222;"><span style="line-height: 16px;">Instead, 
              the mission of the Ministry of Defence (MINDEF) and Singapore Armed 
              Forces (SAF) is realised by financial contributions capped at 6% of 
              Singapore's Gross Domestic Product (GDP). As the city state's GDP crept 
              past S$300 billion in 2010, table napkin calculations show that MINDEF 
              and the SAF are working well within the budget cap. </span></span><br> <span style="color: #222222;"></span><br> <span style="color: #222222;"><span style="line-height: 16px;">If anything, there is ample room for growth.</span></span><span style="color: #222222;"><span style="line-height: 16px;"><br> </span></span><br> <span style="color: #222222;"><span style="line-height: 16px;"><strong>Reference customer</strong></span></span><br> <span style="color: #222222;"><span style="line-height: 16px;">Makers of
               war machines and other defence equipment are likely to keep their ears 
              tuned to that magic Defence budget figure in the hope of enjoying 
              spinoffs as MINDEF/SAF renews its arsenal.</span></span><br> <span style="color: #222222;"></span><br> <span style="color: #222222;"><span style="line-height: 16px;">Singapore's
               military procurement priorities in coming years - which need not 
              necessarily fall within the scope of the FY 2012/13 work year - include 
              but are not limited to:</span></span><br> <span style="color: #222222;"><span style="line-height: 16px;">- Fast landing craft for the Republic of Singapore Navy (RSN) capable of embarking Leopard 2SG-class main battle tanks</span></span><br> <span style="color: #222222;"><span style="line-height: 16px;">- Renewal of the RSN's maritime patrol aircraft fleet</span></span><br> <span style="color: #222222;"><span style="line-height: 16px;">- A replacement for the Republic of Singapore Air Force (RSAF) C-130 Hercules fleet</span></span><br> <span style="color: #222222;"><span style="line-height: 16px;">- Reappraisal of the size and composition of the RSAF fighter force after the F-5S/T Tiger II fighter jets are stood down</span></span><br> <span style="color: #222222;"><span style="line-height: 16px;">- A medium-lift helicopter to replace Super Puma and Cougars</span></span><br> <span style="color: #222222;"><span style="line-height: 16px;">- A dedicated CSAR bird</span></span><br> <span style="color: #222222;"><span style="line-height: 16px;">- Sensors and hardstandings for an air defence system that can also track and engage tube/rocket artillery ordnance</span></span><br> <span style="color: #222222; line-height: 16px;"><br> </span><br> <span style="color: #222222; line-height: 16px;">The SAF is also likely 
              to continue committing combat or combat support forces to selected 
              overseas deployments, provided such commitments can be made within the 
              SAF's defence readiness calendar - already heavily populated with 
              critical force development items that will see the SAF train with one 
              foreign armed forces every week throughout the year.</span><span style="color: #222222; line-height: 16px;"><br> </span><br> <span style="color: #222222; line-height: 16px;">The world's arms industry will be angling for contracts as the republic's war chest is revealed this Friday.</span><span style="color: #222222;"><span style="line-height: 16px;"><br> </span></span><br> <span style="color: #222222;"><span style="line-height: 16px;">In addition, Singapore's no-nonsense approach to weapons purchases makes it a valued reference customer.</span></span><span style="color: #222222; line-height: 16px;"><br> </span><br> <span style="color: #222222; line-height: 16px;">Defence companies that 
              count the SAF as a customer enjoy bragging rights for having 
              successfully aced an evaluation process known (or notorious, as the case
               may be) industry-wide for its technical competence, thoroughness in 
              defining specifications, mile-high tender documentation and rigor in 
              field trials.</span><br> <span style="color: #222222;"></span><br> <span style="color: #222222;"><span style="line-height: 16px;">Having 
              gone through the washing machine, defence companies that come up tops 
              after being made to draft and rewrite documentation that can amount to 
              hundreds of pages can say, hand on heart, that they are better armed to 
              tackle less-rigorous procurement processes in other parts of the globe.</span></span><br> <span style="color: #222222;"><span style="line-height: 16px;"><br> </span></span><br> <span style="color: #222222;"><span style="line-height: 16px;">All the 
              guesswork about the level and size of Singapore's commitment to its 
              national defence will be answered when the Budget Statement is tabled.

              <p>You must be very young.</p>
              <p>Actually and unfortunately, I do know charter rates for air freighters which is under $20k per flight hour for an AN-124. Its $23k for the bigger AN-225. A 737 costs $6k per flight hour. Its about 4-5 hours (~3000 km) from Darwin to Singapore.</p>
              <p>One can actually review internet posts like the below on indicative rates which in most cases is actually cheaper (as non-outsized airlift).</p>
              <p><a href="http://www.stratosjets.com/blog/2010/08/private-jet-charter-q-a-how-much-do-private-jet-charters-cost-week-1.html">http://www.stratosjets.com/blog/2010/08/private-jet-charter-q-a-how-much-do-private-jet-charters-cost-week-1.html</a></p>
              <p>When one thinks about it, it can be quite profitable. An airliner can fly as much as 4,000 flight hours a year, multiplied by charter rates = quite a significant profit. On the other hand, a military aircraft won't hit anywhere close to those flight hours so acquisitions tend to have different considerations. That's also why new procurement practices eg FSTA in the UK will now be open to commercial hire. But in your case, piano playing to cow probably applies.</p>

              <p>When one thinks about it, it can be quite profitable. An airliner can fly as much as 4,000 flight hours a year, multiplied by charter rates = quite a significant profit. On the other hand, a military aircraft won't hit anywhere close to those flight hours so acquisitions tend to have different considerations. That's also why new procurement practices eg FSTA in the UK will now be open to commercial hire. But in your case, piano playing to cow probably applies.</p>

              <p>lol. Young chap, you have absolutely no idea what I do for a living. Charter rates are charter rates, you can continue to be the cow ignoring the facts but that's consistently you from what I've noted.</p>
              <p>Funnily, if you were old enough, you'd realise that one can actually find out charter rates for AN-124 directly from charter companies. There are a few who actually charter them, y'know but again piano to cow comes to mind.</p>
