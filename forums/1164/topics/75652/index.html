            <div class='col-md body'>Signing on in the Army is a major career move and should not be rushed into.<br><br>Ask yourself, do you really like the Army in the first place? If u don't want to be stuck with a shit job for at least 4 years. After that if u want to enter the private sector for another job, the skills u learned before may have become irrelevant in the ever-changing economy.<br><br>Don't know if u like it? Then I suggest u use the NS time to get a taste of Army life first before u come to a decision. After all, it's 2 and a half years and u can sign on any time.<br></div>
