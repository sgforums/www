            <div class='col-md body'>SOPMOD M4 Accessory Kit<br><br>The Special Operations Peculiar Modification (SOPMOD)I M4A1 Kit was developed by USSOCOM (United States Special Operations Command) for use with units under its jurisdiction. The kit features an M4A1 rifle, a Rail Interface System http://www.gun-world.net/USA/M16/M4/ar9.jpg(RIS) handguard system developed by Knight's Armament (KAC), a shortened quick-detacheable M203 grenade launcher and leaf sight, a KAC silencer, KAC rear back-up sight, an Insight Technologies AN/PEQ2a visible laser/infrared designator, along with Trijicon ACOG, Reflex optics and a nightvision sight. This kit was designed to be configurable (modular) for various missions and the kit is in service right now with Special Operations units (though many operators have dumped the Trijicon Reflex sight for Aimpoint red dot sights and EOTech holographic sights).<br><br>A 2nd generation SOPMOD (now known as SOPMOD II) is currently under development, with many different manfacturers competing for a contract. Notable manfucturers include Knight's Armament Corp and the URX, ARMS and their Selective Integrated Rail (SIR) system, along with Lewis Machine &amp; Tool.<br><br><img src="http://www.gun-world.net/USA/M16/M4/config1.jpg"><br><img src="http://www.gun-world.net/USA/M16/M4/config2.jpg"><br><img src="http://www.gun-world.net/USA/M16/M4/config3.jpg"><br><img src="http://www.gun-world.net/USA/M16/M4/config4.jpg"><br><img src="http://www.gun-world.net/USA/M16/M4/ar9.jpg"><br><br>Note the drum magazine fitted to this fine specimen. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"></div>

Its main components are constructed of high impact plastic. Avoiding trouble-prone compression springs, the C-MAG utilizes a unique rotation device and low torsion stress springs which ensure positive control of each round and proper feeding. The design provides for equal distribution of the ammunition in each of the twin drums located on either side of the weapon. This results in a fixed center of gravity during firing, an important attribute during full automatic performance. The compact design allows for better ground clearance.<br><br></div>

DSTA, ST AERO etc are mainly developing stuff for the SAF aren't they. so if we *do* have more advanced equipment, then why aren't individual units equipped with them? anyway, whatever the SAF's rationale is for only bringing advanced equipment out when visitors come, the fact remains that our ordinary soldiers do not have use of these things.<br><br>3. why should SAF/MINDEF make a fuss about troopers buying their own gear? saves them money...in any case, generally only regulars buy their own gear. no point shelling out $96 for a pair of blackhawk SBO straps ( just the shoulder straps! ) or similar prices for a single SBO back pouch if you're only going to be using it for a year or two. anyway is it common for regs from other units to buy additional personal gear? there aren't even all that many regs in cdo who buy them...are you sure "most of our troops" are willing to buy all that? i know i certainly am not, not on my measly nsf pay...</div>

Just take the E.Timor incident, new M16S2 were issued with brand new ammos( Not the 1s you use at range ).  Also, you can trace back how log it took SAF to issue SAR 21 to the units.

Hopefully you get to visit other units during your 2yrs of service. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>I agreed with you too that being NSF, 1 should not bother about purchasing such expensive gear.
