So the hostage may or may not be terminated, at least incapacitated depending on the kind of exit wound</div></blockquote>You see too much movies !!! Your explaination is that you purposely shoot at the hostage as the round will go through and hit the bad guy behind. This is never the doctrine of that kind , also too risky to attempt and take.</div>

Also it take more time to train people to use scalable zoom, so that is totally no suitable of normal infrantry, as it take up time and cost.</div>

In fact it is very hard to spot the different, the easiler is to look at the magzine, which the 5.56mm is much wider than the 9mm.<br><br>The Hk53 offer more firepower and range, which make it a rifle while the MP5 is a submachine gun.</div>
