These are strangers who have never done you any direct and personal harm before.<br><br>Therefore soldiers who fought in war can hardly be considered as civilised because war itself s a bloody violent affair. One can only try to make this bloody affair as 'civilised' as possible by agreeing to certain ground rules(eg Geneva Convention). Such as not ill treating POWs and not executing soldiers who are in the process of surrendering etc. But these are just rules where enforcement is hard to carry out.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>just a general observation, in WWII Japanese soldier committed war crime in Nanking.  such as Rape, execution base on ethnicity. killing of children. etc.  There is even a competition on how many heads the officer chop off. It was publish on news paper.<br><br>these killing were not done on a battlefield. These were done after the battlefield were over. The people were systematic round up.<br><br>its one thing to disucss about killing innocent people on a battlefield but it would be another to compare the act that was committed with the Japanese soldier.<br><br></div>
