            <div class='col-md body'>Navy commandos storm Â‘hijackedÂ’ liner<br>Adrian David<br><br>Mar 29:<br>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br><br>THE Royal Malaysian NavyÂ’s (RMN) commando unit, Paskal, Â“stormedÂ” a cruise liner Â“hijackedÂ” by terrorists northwest of Pulau Pangkor, rescuing some 600 passengers and crew in a dramatic operation.<br>Four teams of 12 Paskal members boarded the ship while another descended from an Ecureuil helicopter using the "fast rope" technique.<br><br>Within minutes, it was all over. The commandos overpowered 12 "terrorists" who were later removed from the ship.<br><br>The drama was a simulated exer-cise by the RMN.<br><br>The exercise Â— a simulated night boarding but carried out during the day Â— was held in conjunction with "Eksesais Kerismas 24/2004" that will end on April 10.<br><br>Briefing the media on board the multi-purpose command and control ship KD Sri Indera Sakti, RMN Fleet Operations Command chief Laksamana Madya Datuk Ramlan Mohamed Ali said the liner was "hijacked" shortly after it left Port Klang for Penang.<br><br>The Paskal members were directed to undertake the tactical "special ship boarding" mission after negotiations between the Government and the terrorists, who "seized" the MV Fajar Samudera in Malaysian waters early yesterday morning, reached a dead-lock. (The Fajar Samudera is actually one of RMN's training ships and acted as a cruise liner for the exercise).<br><br>"The scenario comprised a group of terrorists in high-speed boats who took control of the liner after boarding it just after dawn. "They wanted a ransom and seve- ral other demands. The liner managed to send out a distress signal to its owners Pelangi Shipping Sdn Bhd," Ramlan said.<br><br>Present at the briefing were RMN Region One commander Laksamana Pertama Mohammed Nordin, who was also the exercise co-ordinating chief, and Paskal commander Kdr Jamalludin Mohd Samad.<br><br>Ramlan said after negotiations were exhausted, the order for the rescue mission, using the sub-surface, surface and aerial assault, was given.<br><br>Paskal members in high-speed rigid hull inflatable boats, a Super Lynx and a Eurocopter AS 355 Ecureuil helicopter, along with support ships KD Sri Negeri Sembilan (patrol vessel), KD Lekiu and KD Jebat (both frigates) and KD Mahawangsa (multi-purpose command and control vessel), were deployed for the mission.<br><br>Using ropes, the Paskal members from the boats boarded the liner from the rear while another team used the "fast rope" technique to descend from the Ecureuil, on loan from Malaysia Helicopter Services.<br><br>Ramlan said the liner was used to present a greater challenge for the navy in dealing with terrorism and piracy on merchant and passenger vessels in Malaysian waters.<br><br>Eksesais Kerismas 24/2004, involving more than 23 vessels, 13 aircraft and more than 3,500 men, began in waters off the Lumut naval base on Wednesday before moving to waters surrounding Pulau Pangkor.<br><br>It proceeds to the South China Sea where it will end at Tanjung Gelang off Kuantan.<br><br>"The exercise is to test the battlereadiness and inter-operability of the navy using realistic elements. It involved three phases Â— base defence and disaster control, conflict with a neighbouring country and regional maritime war," Ramlan said.<br><br>The exercise also saw for the first time the deployment of five of the newly-acquired Augusta Westland Super Lynx helicopters from the frigates KD Jebat and KD Lekiu.<br><br>The Super Lynx is a multi-role helicopter for anti-surface and antisubmarine warfare as well as search and rescue operations.<br><br>The RMN will also deploy the helicopter from the Meko-100 New Generation Patrol Vessels.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I think it would be more tactical to deploy by RIHB. If the ship was rigged with explosives to blow it up sky-high, the helo would have given them away, let alone the fast-rope exercise. Paskal would be on bodybag detail instead... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br><br>Deploying by inflatable would mean that they configure one of their Scorpene sub for spec ops. A good way to describe the ideal infil is the ship-storming scene in the movie "Navy Seals"...night time, and have the sub shadowing the ship.  That's what I think...any thoughts anyone?<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Whether you go in by boat or helo depends greatly on the sea-state and the type of ship being boarded.<br><br>The RAN mainly sends boarding partys on boats to smaller vessels (fishing vessels) and uses helo's for larger vessels (Cargo ships, Oil tankers)<br><br>I dont think that the Helo's give away to much as the vessels usually close well within sight of each other before boarding takes place, pretty hard to miss a ANZAC class frigate on your six.<br><br>But i suppose that in hostage rescue missions the SASR/TAG-E/TAG-W would go in on RHIB or their fast assault craft to get the job done.</div>
