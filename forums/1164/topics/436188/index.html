              Over 30 years ago a man named Proksch, later he named himself Serge Kirchhofer, was send by the Sowjetic KGB, espezialy Putin the KGB-director in the former Eastern Germany, now Russian premier, from the DDR tobAustria for spying. Proksch ha gotten much money and buyed the hotel-restaurant Demel, best known for its good fancy-cakes, in the Vienese first district. He invited then the whole members of the Austrian goverment to his noble hotel-restaurant for rich parties, where he presented them French champsign, caviar and a lot of self-made fancy-cakes. Pretty girls were also there  to serve the polizicians. The drunken Austrisn goverment-members told all political news from.the parliament to Proksch and he sent all what he had heared to the KGB IN Dresden, Eastern Germany, DDR. Proksch got very soon in a lack of money becazse of the expensive parties and he made then up his mind to cheat an insurance. He bought from the Austrian army, the Bundesheer, an old outranged battle-plain, a Swedish Flying Ton. This was not difficult for him, because he knew the Austrian minister of defence very good. He rented an old factory-hall in Nether Austria, builded out one power-plant of the plane-wreckage, puted this in a large wood-box and sold this to a nuclear firm in Hongkong declareing it as Uranium-mill. He bought from Rumania a certificate for this fright helped by the Austrian minister of foreign affairs. He then insured this faked fright very high, transported it to Triest on the Italian mediteranisn sea, and gave this fright on the ship Licona, which was bound to Hongkong. But that ship never arrived his aim, because Proksch had also puted into the ship a clock-bomb, which exploded on the highsea and the Lucona sank to the seabottom and nobody of its crew could be saved.
              Proksch went now to the insurance and wanted to get the money for the loss of his insuranced fright. He was suddenly arrested, because the insurance did not believe his reports and recognized a crime. Proksch denied all crimes, for which he were accused by the state-attourney in the court of justice, But the attourney rented a small submarine and dived to the seabottom were the Lucona had been sunk. He found the wreckage of the ship on the seabottom. He filmed all and this was enough proof for the court and Proksch was sentenced for life-prison. Some years ago he died after a medical operation to his heart in the state-correction-center Graz Karlau.
