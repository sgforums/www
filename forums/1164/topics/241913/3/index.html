            <div class='col-md body'>Anyway it is possible to use the M2 HMG as an infantry weapon... at least one American paratrooper tried it in WW2 anyway. He took a .50cal off a knocked-out AFV, made a sling out of a scarf, and lugged it into battle and fired at the Germans while screaming "I'm a jew! I'm a jew!"... and according to a friend he was killing them.<br><br>And yes, this is a true story.</div>

The heavier round creates more hydrostatic shock within soft tissue, and if it hits bone itself will cause the bone to shatter and splinter far more violently then a 7.62mm can ever achieve.<br><br>The superior killing ability of .50cal over 7.62mm was never in doubt, so I dunno where the WO you mentioned is getting his info from, but experience in Iraq will prove him wrong quite quickly. People hit with a burst from a .50cal can literally come apart quite violently and bursts have been known to take off limbs and do all kinds of nasy things to the human body. In generation kill,  the driver of one enemy car attempting to ram a marine platoon was engaged with a .50cal and was hit in the head. When they examined the body they discovered that a single round, which had hit the head in the center, had blown away a large portion of the head, scooping out a neat 'V' shaped chunk of tissue.<br><br>Now, with a .50cal, you tend to get effects on human targets like this:<br><br><span style="color: red;">Warning very GRAPHIC</span><br><a href="http://www.lo.redjupiter.com/images/braden/DeadTerrorist.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://www.lo.redjupiter.com/images/braden/DeadTerrorist.jpg</a><br><br>This was supposedly done by a .50cal round...<br><br>And of course, one grunt talks about surviving a .50cal shot to the foot. There was quite a lot of damage done.<br><br><blockquote>As most of you who know me on this site know, I work for a leading PMC in Iraq and I am a PA with 25 years of trauma experience, mostly in SOF units. On Dec 16, I sustained a very severe ankle wound in Iraq by a .50 cal round (yep...I'll let you figure out what happened!). At any rate, the .50 cal round entered approx 4 cm posterio-medial above my medial malleolus and exited anteriorly at the articulation of my tib-fib and talus, sparing my foot. It took out my dorsalis pedis artery and most dorso-medial arterioles and nicked my posterior tibial arery...in short I was hemorrhaging rather briskly. I immediately placed a "good tourniquet" on my lower leg...continued bleeding! I then place a secone tourniquet in the popliteal space...continued bleeding! One of my teammates then placed a 3rd tourniquet between the two...continued bleeding! A pack of QC was then place in the wound and packed with a dressing....bleeding stopped immediately! I am a believer in the stuff!<br>Every "operator" in my unit is issued a pack of QC in their individual medical kit, that I pack. Two points...if one sustains a wound serious enough to have QC poured into it...then that person will almost certainly be taken to the OR for at least a "washout procedure"...so contamination isn't an isuue.</blockquote>There's no way you can achieve that with 7.62mm, if the .50cal was really less wounding then the 7.62mm, the Germans would certainly have no reason to fear it more then the .30cal the Yanks also had it in use, and the Germans had a healthy respect for the M2 Browning.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>50 cal will really hurt people. It's called a HMG for a reason, and yes i would appreciate it if they mount a 50 cal on the Leo2.<br><br>I would rather they add in the 50 cal to all gpmg only armed vehicles currently though.  It would be a huge boost in defense ability.<br>Anyone notice that our 50 cal is a thumb press trigger? It that common or is a normal index-pull trigger a better option?  i find it quite hard to aim with actually. Luckily i have a joystick hehe.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>The WO is definitely right about the first part - .50cal is definitely overkill against human targets.<br><br>But since when is that a bad thing?<img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green">  The horrific injuries may also have a bad morale effect on the other attacking enemy troops.<br><br>The .50cal can shoot further and flatter trajectory than all the other calibres - that's why they are used a spotter rifle for the 106mm and now as long distance sniper rifles.<br><br>But it is also interesting to see how far SAF has come if a WO can talk about things like muzzle velocity etc. Most WO I encountered during my time were pretty stupid uneducated types whose only claim to the uniform is being able to shout a lot.</div>

But he was certainly smoking you one times big one when he said that .50cal does less tissue damage then 7.62. For the same ammo type, this is simply quite impossible unless you have some magic bullet fragmentation effects... which do not happen in your normal 7.62mm.<br><br>However we are assuming that there are no other effects that you want like punching through cover to get to the dude behind and what have you not.<br><br>So the .50 has its place and role... the real question is if we are willing to exploit it.</div>

Having a gpmg is very handy in this situation for escape....not attack.
