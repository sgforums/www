            <div class='col-md body'>Please allow me to shed some light.<br><br>The reason why the SM1 coaxial and turret mounted MG are without  butts is to enable them to be mounted within the tiny turret itself, there isn't enough space for the butt. Both are wthout butt so that they can be interchangeable should one in the turret is spolit the other can be dismounted and take over.<br><br>This of course creates the problem of inaccuracy when fiing from the turret but MG is not meant to be accurate as they are to engage area targets. The TC must have hand on the MG to prevent it from swinging around while on the move.<br><br>As to why the BX and Primus don't need a MG without butt is because they don't mount any MG internally. And for BX as they are infantry men should the BX be disabled, they can still dismount the MG and use as GPMGs.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>It is near impossible to aim a MG - with or without butt - while the tank is rolling through rough terrain. The best option is still to use tracer ammo to guide your shots.<br><br>There are a lot of situations like WW2 aircraft, IFV firing port mounted M16, co-axial etc are usually fitted with tracer ammo as you can't really aim through the weapon sights very well.<br><br>So the tracers act as a guide to land your shots.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>In the early days, the  AMX-13 used 0.5 HMG to simulate main gun firing due to budget constrains. The range of a 0.5 round is similar to that 75mm HE round. This HMG is being mounted on top of the main gun on a small T-shaped platform, near the loop. You can see this in the 1st pic provided by moca earlier on.</div>
