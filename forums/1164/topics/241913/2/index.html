I doubt SAF is interested in a change at the moment </blockquote>Well one Abrams tanker answered this once, the reason why they mounted the HMG on the commander's position, and a 7.62 as their coax is because the coax was intended to used as a GPMG where the main gun is overkill... the .50 is intended to cover the arcs that are out of the main gun's elevation, as well as AA use.<br><br>Hence it makes more sense to mount a HMG on the roof, as it would mean covering your upper arcs with a more powerful weapon then putting all your heavy weapons to your main gun slot.<br><br>I don't think having or lacking a .50cal will make or break an AFV... that is just silly. But in terms of it being an idea... hey it isn't such a bad idea to put a .50 up there.<br><br>Another reason I can think of is ammo issues... we might just be too lazy to dish out too many ammo types for one AFV... lame reason I know, but the .50 on your tank can't really share ammo with the coax and loader's MG.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>.50 cal is probably overkill for smaller softskins like a rover... however I think if you are engaging things like trucks and the like, it takes a lot of 7.62mm rounds to truly disable it... a .50cal could easily deadline the target by putting a round through the engine block where a 7.62 would only have marginal effects.<br><br>As for AA, .50 cal isn't actually that effective (though a lot better then 7.62). When it comes versus attack jets nothing less then a 20mm is really useful, and you need a high rate of fire as well. Attack Helos are resistant to HMG fire and you need to put a lot into them before they go down, though light helos are another story.<br><br>For infantry however, I would prefer a .50 then 7.62... reason being the round can easily punch through barriers and a single good hit will put that guy down for good if not kill him outright. A .50 (and the HMG family) are the ultimate (pratical) anti-infantry weapon that you can mount on an AFV and still be operated. It isn't easy to gun the M2HB due to its weight, but our C.I.S .50 is a lot lighter and hence more flexible in the roof MG role.<br><br>As to why we don't use it on our tanks... I don't see any reason except nobody in the SAF is really willing to make that move. That's about it. Technically there's nothing stopping us from using the .50 as the commander's machine gun.<br><br>But I think it's moot for the SM1s, for they are on the way out. Prehaps the Leo2 might be a different story, but I think they're just going to keep with the 7.62.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>My sentiments, too.<br><br>I once posted a picture of a foreign AMX-13 mounted with a .50cal so space is not an issue. The site is: www.chars-francaise.net but it is down.<br><br>Anyway, the rarity of AMX-13 mounted with .50 cal does point to the fact the the GPMG is usually favoured by other nations.<br><br>Far from what CM06 described to be near obsolescence for the .50 cal, it is alive and well and heavily used by all nations on tanks.<br><br>Especially the Americans and Israelis. Pics of MY's PT-91 also showed a .50cal mounted high for the AA role.<br><br>Both the Argentines and British used them in Falklands for the infantry role.<br><br>The only point I doubt is that I think the CIS 50 with SLAP rounds could be quite effective against attack choppers if they manage to hit one.<br><br>Another point I want to add is that the IDF used them cos a lot of fighting is done in BUA. The .50 can blast through walls and other obstacles that would stop a 7.62.<br><br>If a .50 bullet hit a guy, I think the injury will be very dramatic.<br><br>In one incident during the Yom Kippur War, an IDF tank was completely out of tank ammo and was facing an Egyptian T-55 getting into firing position. Out of desperation, the IDF tank commander emptied his .50 cal on the T-55's turret.<br><br>Though it didn't penetrate, the heavy .50 cal shells slamming onto their turret unnerved the Egyptians so much that they pulled out. It was a game of "chicken" that paid off.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Moca:<br><br>i'm never said that 50 cal's obsolete. . I'm using that thing. i'm a vcom for m113 btw. I have complete trust in our 50 cal for that matter. It aint a "crusade"/ I choose not to reply so that it's not a petty argument.<br><br>I'm saying that's it's less practical than you think it can be. If SAF decides to switch to 50 cal..i would say go ahead without a splot. They just need to call back all the NSmen to retrain in the 50cal.<br><br>That aside, 50 cal is obviously better in terms of performance vs 7.62. Not to mention the boost in penetration ability vs softskin + apcs+helis from SLAP.  a 50 cal will however not solve the following things i mentioned for our tanky friends<br><br>1) barrel change difficulty.<br>2) lack of large calibre defense weapon after abandoning of SM1.<br>(the rest is a matter of opinion)<br><br>That's my stance.  Do i have to repeat i'm not against an upgrade to the commander's mg? I'm saying that there will be things to consider.<br><br>You dont have to convince me that 50 cals better. I know it is.<br><br>Anyway, to sum it up. 7..62 VS 50 cal as a commander's weapon is in similar light as infantry carried 5.56mm vs 7.62mm weapon.  Both has their advantages and disadvantages.  I totally agree to the benefits 50 cal will bring as a comd mg..but it doesnt solve the problem from loss of a gpmg. Hence my opinion in the case.</div>

It's an exchange of opinions, not an argument.<br><br>Like I said, I'm sure that SAF has very good reasons for not putting the .50cal. I don't know what it is, but I didn't think many of your points were valid.<br><br>Rather than go head to head with someone who is so convinced of his views, i just tried to add some humour with SInglish. But you asked to be taken seriously.<br><br>OK, so...<br><br>Take for example your scenario of the SM1 crew trying to dismantle the 7.62 after their tank is disabled, I assume, in a battle.<br><br>So after their tank is hit during a battle, assuming none of the 3 LUCKY crewmen got injured... do they:<br><br>Â• dismantle the GPMG under fire while the shooting is still going on? It is very common for tanks to get hit several times during battle. And most enemy are waiting to shoot crewmen of disabled tanks as they emerge. So is dismantling a GPMG and lugging it around under fire what precious tank crews should be doing? Or should they be doing their best to survive and escape instead of carrying a 12+kg GPMG?<br><br>Â• dismantle the GPMG after the shooting has stopped? In which case, they would be holding on a heavy piece of equipment for what purpose? While I don't debate that it would be useful if you can dismantle the gun and use but this is surely not SAF's reason for mounting a 7.62 over a .50cal.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Okay Since you want to talk about this scenario:<br><br>SM1 Disabling : This can be a mobility + engine kill.  RPGs that glance the track, hit the engine block blah blah blah. Yes the crew survive.<br><br>Next, do you know what holds the gpmg in place?  two safety pins. Press pull out, press pull out, the gpmg will still be in place.  While the commander provide covering fire with that , the gunner + driver gets out. Grabbing 1-2 box of gpmg ammo.  Then they provide cover (carbine) then the comd gets out.  Lifting the MG with one hand out of the mount hops off then gets down, pulls out bipod(prone)  continue to suppress enemy while his buddies fall back.  That's how it works....I rather have them have this chance of run then three men with only 60 rounds on them.  It's the same drill the (current) mortar team goes through when their mortar/vehicle is disabled.  They grab their mg and run.<br><br>You are saying this scenario as if the crew would just jump out and run. This will get them shot in their rear end.<br><br>Tell me what would you do with a 50 cal comd mg in a disabled tank (maybe small fire, smoke, chance of explosion unknown currently)</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>With all this discussion about why SM1 not using 50 cal HMG........have you guys consider space constraint in the tank?<br><br>Using 7.62, each SM1 combat load is 10-12 boxes (for both CMG and coax)<br>If using 0.5 HMG, you have to make re-distribute the ammo load.<br>Moreover, the area of 1 box of 0.5 cal is equivalent to 2 boxes of 7.62. Meaning less ammo.<br><br>Replacing the 7.62 ammo is already a chore due to the space constraint in the tank comd cupula. To take a 0.5 ammo out would mean a very very skinny tank comd with a very strong upper body strength.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz"><br><br>My 2 cents worth of info from a ex-armour guy.......

            <div class='col-md body'>Being able to recover a mounted weapon from a disabled unit is a good feature to have, but I hardly think it's a big deciding factor as to what to mount on your AFV. Guns we can always make more of and there's always the thermite grenade. If you are caught in a situtation where your AFV crew need a GPMG to defend yourself and friendlies are not around to support you then you are very likely screwed anyway.<br><br>In the end as to why the SAF does no use the .50cal... I think it's just a matter of user flexibility. Both systems have their own pros and cons and it's really up to the user to realize them and work accordingly. There's little sense for us to delve into regrettable Glocklogic to try to prove either positions by nitpicking or reality-bending gymnastics.<br><br>Personally of course I would prefer to have a .50cal (all things considered) as part of my arsenal if I was in an AFV... esp. a roomy one like the Leo2.<br><br>That said, a .50 cal is always nice to have as part of your arsenal when you need serious punch. However for infantry in the open a 7.62mm makes better anti-personnel economics as the ROF is higher, you can carry more rounds, and for anti-infantry work the 7.62mm works well enough.<br><br>But when it comes to FIBUA and you have this dude hiding inside a room firing at you from a window, .50cal is certianly what you want to send downrange to him. 7.62mm just lacks the punch to make a serious impression on targets that are under proper cover... probably the reason why the Yanks make a WW2 gun still a part of their arsenal, and in fact well intend its use to carry on with its replacement being yet another HMG (a high tech one at that).<br><br>I suppose when it comes down to us, we try to put the HMG as an asset weapon by mounting it on selected APCs and IFVs... using it as and when applied rather then going in with it standard issue to most of the units. This is the way we fight, and of course we could easily change our tatics to make more use of the .50... but then again it boils down on what style you really intend to use your tools in.</div>
