During the Cold War the overlapping umbrella of numerous SAM and even gun systems for all approaches into the Soviet Union and most of the Warsaw Pact nations was very much feared by the Western military, albeit it took a while to believe that one could probably have daringly infiltrated via small and light wooden piston-engined, single-seater airframes.<br><br>Nonetheless, Russian missile technology in the SAM department is revered to be even more advanced and cheaper than the latest that the West can offer.  Which I believe to be the fundamental case for choosing the Igla against the others, like US Stinger, UK Blowpipe/Starstreak, or even continuing with the costly Mistral, which isn't a pure MANPADs to start with.  True, the Igla's targeting device may look crude, but it's still cheap and comparably effective.  And that's what one would expect from a MANPADs that is meant to be shoulder-fired - easy to use.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I'm interested in tactics used with ADA. In a fluid battle environment, there's always a good chance of friendly-fire AA as evidenced by the Argentinian side during the Falklands conflict; just one of many instances. In that engagement, the Brits used a simple box system where any aircraft in a particular box would be fired upon and the Brit pilots understood where to fly and where not to fly.<br><br>What other types of tactics are there for allied aircraft operating within the umbrella of ground-based AA? And don't tell me visual identification since in the confusion of battle, if you're under fire and under the stress of self-preservation, it would be too easy to fire an Igla at anything flying in the air.</div>

Doctrinally, the former Warsaw Pact states have historically been more persuaded of the utility of mobile armoured AA units than the West has been.<br><br>With the Cold War over, though, as PJ has pointed out, nothing should stop us buying Russian if they can produce a superior product. Would it be possible for us to buy ZSU-23-4s (which could also complement armoured spearheads nicely by doubling as heavy anti-personnel units) or Tungustas?</div></blockquote>I think the key concern for the SAF when purchasing new equipments would be inter-compability with its other system, which fortunately or unfortunately are Western-dominated.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_redface.gif" alt="Embarassed" title="Embarassed"> In such a case, purchasing a Russian ADA equipment like the Tunguska could pose problems in term of interfacing with our data networks such as interface from the Giraffe radars and E-2Cs. Case in point would be the SAF's purchase of the Igla, which as a MANPADs wouldn't require such a high level of interface. Just point them in the approximate direction and wait for the target to appear. On the other hand, even though Singapore had evaluated the S-300, no purchase has been reported to date. Undoubtedly there is the worry of introducing a new capability into the region, however, the S-300 would have been a mere step for the SAF to take from the retiring of the old Bloodhound long-range SAMs. A more likely scenario would be the difficulty in interfacing I guess...</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Personally, I rather like Russian ADA systems myself. They are more robust as compared to the Western systems and most importantly, they are specifically designed to handle the threats posed by Western fighter-bombers, which Singapore is likely to face... i.e. F/A 18s, Hawk light fighters, A-4s...<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"></div>
