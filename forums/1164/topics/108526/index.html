There is already an SOP to handle this.<br><br>If the situation is relatively benign like the one you describe, the car will be aimed at, challenged and ordered to stop over a megaphone. If the car refuses to stop after two or three challenges, it is threatened with deadly force ("Stop!" "Stop!" "Stop or I will shoot!"). If it still refuses to stop, it is attacked with the minimum force needed to stop it. Assuming all of these rules are followed, even if the car turns out to be full of unarmed civilians, you have broken no laws. This is similar to how police handle the situation.<br><br>If the situation is more dangerous (e.g. the car starts moving suddenly when you approach within 50m), and the commander on the ground has reason to believe he is under attack (e.g. bombings have occured before), you are allowed to open fire immediately without a challenge. Again, minimum force must be used. This is not against military law even if you are shown later to be in error, but you must demonstrate that you had reasonable cause to think you were in danger and that you used minimum force.<br><br>The same situation applies to a civilian that has gotten out of the car, or approaches troops or a checkpoint. Target, challenge and if necessary engage with minimum force. If you are in danger, defend yourself with minimum force.<br><br>There are also SOPs for searching suspect vehicles. The basic idea is that you get the occupants of the vehicle to open everything while you look and ask questions at a safe distance. For searching civilians in time of war, the same thing applies (make him pull up his shirt, drop his pants and open his bags for inspection at a safe distance). For searching of females, female troops or policewomen and a private search area should be arranged (now you know why we have female troops).<br><br>Go ask soldiers from the new POI batallion 6SIR -- they will give you the full story.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Tech Term is "Rules of Engagement".<br><br>i) Use any and all force to protect yourself.<br>ii) Give adequate warning before applying deadly force (shooting into the air/on ground before car, 2km away is too bloody far, more like 300m before threat can be recgonized as such).<br>iii) Use sufficient force to show person making threat that you can and will use deadly force, shooting car engine block to disable.<br>iv) Protect property while obeying standing orders (assuming orders are to stop, search any intruders and to protect 'medic trucks' (duh!))<br>v) If above fails shoot the f#*k out of the B@$%+d.<br><br>My own philo, if you have to shoot aim for incapaciting wound or else duck.

There is just to many fault with your scenerio !!! First you say your tanks are position to strike at artilleries !!! then you say your tanks is guarding medic truck !!!<br><br>Make up your mind what the f@@K is your mission !!! If you are posed for pre-emptive strike against artilleries, that be in the forefront which no way medic trucks will be with you !!! For medicial they will be well protected by ground troops.<br><br>You will have at least another tank and 2 IFV with your tank. By the way IVF carry armour troopers .....!!! Just deploy out the troops to intercept the car !!!<br>At 2km, think that is just too far for you to know who is in the car, maybe your OC ! Anyway just have to wait for it to come closer.<br><br>I will not even think of using tanks or IFV ! Why first using a 20mm chain gun and cannon is over kill.<br><br>Next if this is war !!! The most important thing at that moment is fuel and tactical. Remember tanks and IFV are not running 24 hrs all the time, as they suck up fuel too fast. I will not be powering up all my tanks or IFV the moment I see a small car at 2 Km away !!! This will generate too much noise and heat signature to totally announ to enemy where my tanks and IFV is. When my armour infantries have all the weapon like GMPG and saw to take it out easily if needed.<br><br></div>

Besides, if your had an MBT, you could use your .50 instead of the main gun, and even if you used the main gun, you could fire a short round as a warning shot.  If someone sees an explosion in front of him and keeps charging, he's asking to get wiped off the face of the earth.  There are so many ways around this situation, the question isn't even worth asking.</div>
