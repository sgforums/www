Training numbers has to be up to Bn level for atec. Not common to have more than (12) for normal training purposes...usually have more than enough in case of VOR. Therefore only enough for 4 Bn.<br><br>2-3) We have 4 training Bns that means ~ 80 SM1s already taken...leaving 270. Take away condemned/destroyed/R&amp;D numbers...maybe 180-240.  Leaving just enough for 15-20 BNs... So at most 4-5+ Bde.<br><br>4) HmmmMaybe it's only one extra Bde.. Armour division maybe??  maybe not.<br><br>5) 22 AMX-10P + 22 AMX-10RC 44 vehicles just enough for 1 Bn.  No mix with Ultra...cause different capabilities. Yeah might be RC bn for 21 div<br><br>6) same idea as the leopards...minus training+overseas+other stuff most likely enough for 1+ Bde.<br><br>Conclusion: Armour Div might still be in formation.<br><br>Am from armour. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"></div>
