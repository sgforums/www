Kinda like what the Americans are doing in Iraq - except we're all Singaporeans, of course. But it's not gonna stop any terrorist who could dissolve into a crowd, or a drive-by bombing (the modus operandi of SE Asian radicals).<br><br>Why not deploy conventional troops or policemen on this beat instead? Or is it a new directive to allocate such highly-trained SOC personnel on such "mundane", 24/7 tasks? Are they adequate standby counterinsurgency forces to repond to a real emergency?</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Just wondering,if their presence there will help Orchard Road become a safer place.Those street gangs are really quite menacing.Last year after a school function at Meridian Hotel,was going to the MRT station and saw this bunch of ah bengs being arrested outside Ngee Ann City there.And at night along Orchard Road,always see alot of cops patrolling the streets it certainly is reassuring.<br><br>But perhaps this time perhaps over-doing alittle.Tactical officers armed with MP5s and revolver wearing tactical gear like Kevlar vests and so on.It may scare off tourists visiting on their first visit here as who wouldn't be alarmed when seeing heavily armed cops on the streets right?Perhaps a better way is to have a bunch of STAR personnel in a civilian vehicle parked somewhere between buildings or in Multi-storied carparks in the area they intend to cover and have plainclothes officers patrol the streets and calling them for backup when needed.<br><br>Lastly,does anyone know why are they not wearing helmets and are wearing berets instead?</div>
