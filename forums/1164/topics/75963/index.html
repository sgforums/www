            <div class='col-md body'>Any fundamental differences in ROE between the two CT units?  Was thinking SOF is more 'shoot-to-kill/first-look-first-kill' where as STAR is 'apprehend/subdue-if-possible'<br><br>So it's as if STAR troopers have a tougher mission requirement posed to them.  Maybe they should be given the priority for stand-off non-LOS, non-lethal weapons over SOF, but SOF need the most armour they can get.  Should strive for the realisation of power-assisted armoured exoframes for SOF then.</div>

What kind of ppl can these be other than tangos.  And in this region, their agenda is<br>notoriously political in nature, on a global scale, e.g. if we support US/UN outrightly in Iraq or if somehow it became known that we were jointly developing weapons with Israel that were used in the so-called 'war against terrorism'.<br><br>In this respect, the STAR could be called upon to assume the same roles and responsibilities as SOF, multiplying the special force elements - taking reference from all the redundant special force organisations within US military itself.<br><br>Anyway, 'war against terrorism' should be rephrased 'war against humans who are anti-human'</div>

Assasinating politician's pet alsatian or poodle.  That would also mean that they would have to learn multiple insertion techniques, by land air or sea.

They are trained Killers.<br><br>The STAR is made up of similar elites but would only handle more overt ops like hostage rescue, or take down of well armed criminals. More covert stuff, I am speculating would be raiding houses of Drug Lords or political opponents.  They are not trained to kill on sight, as they are police after all.

            <div class='col-md body'>Er, how about breaching Charge? Doh.  Why pick a lock when u can blow the door down?

Okay, traumatic experience for the hostage, but at least they LIVE to tell the tail on how they'd rather be killed by their captors than to live thru another breaching charge.</div>
