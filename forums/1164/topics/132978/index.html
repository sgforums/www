            <div class='col-md body'>CHAKRI NARUEBET OFFSHORE PATROL HELICOPTER CARRIER, THAILAND<br><br>The Offshore Patrol Helicopter Carrier, HTMS Chakri Naruebet, was constructed for the Royal Thai Navy (RTN) by Spanish shipbuilders Izar (formerly EN Bazan).<br><br>Under a contract signed in July 1992, the Chakri Naruebet was constructed at IzarÂ’s El Ferrol yard in Spain and commissioned in March 1997. With a design similar to that of the Spanish carrier Principe de Asturias, it is fitted with a 12Â° ski jump to enable the use of Harrier-style aircraft. The carrier is tasked with warfare/flagship command and control, air support for amphibious operations and the Thai surface fleet, EEZ surveillance and protection, search and rescue, and disaster relief. It is based in the Gulf of Thailand.<br><br>DESIGN<br><br>The ship is equipped with six multi-mission Sikorsky S-70B Seahawk helicopters, designed for use in an anti-submarine role. These are supplemented with six ex-Spanish Matador AV-8S (Harrier) short take-off/vertical landing (STOVL) aircraft. The Chakri NaruebetÂ’s 174.6m x 27.5m flight deck, which terminates in a 12Â° ski jump, can accommodate five simultaneous helicopter take-off/landings; the hangar provides space for ten medium helicopters or Harrier-sized aircraft. The carrierÂ’s maximum speed is 26 knots, with a cruise speed of 16 knots. Range is estimated to be 10,000nm at 12 knots. Two spade rudders and four hull stabilisers have been fitted.<br><br>COMMAND SYSTEM<br><br>The command and control system is made up of a combat information centre with seven Inisel consoles and an auxiliary console. The combat system is the AN/UYK-43C Lowboy with weapon systems integration carried out by FABA, Spain.<br><br>MISSILES<br><br>The ship has provision for one eight-cell Mk 41 vertical launch system (VLS) for the Seasparrow surface-to-air missile. Seasparrow uses semi-active radar guidance, has a range of 14km and a speed of Mach 2.5. The carrier has three MBDA (formerly Matra BAe Dynamics) Sadral six-cell launchers for the Mistral missile. Mistral is a short-range anti-aircraft missile able to intercept in-coming sea-skimming missiles. The Sadral six-cell launcher is a stabilised turret equipped with a television camera which can be fitted with an infra-red channel for target acquisition. The Mistral missile is equipped with an infrared homing head supplied by SAGEM and has a 3kg high-explosive warhead loaded with tungsten balls. Range is 4km.<br><br>GUNS<br><br>Four Raytheon/General Dynamics Phalanx Close-In Weapon Systems and two 30mm naval guns are yet to be fitted. Phalanx has a 20mm/53-calibre six-barrel gun capable of firing 3,000 rounds/min to a target range of 1.5km.<br><br>COUNTERMEASURES<br><br>Four BAE Systems Integrated Defense Solutions (formerly Tracor) Mk 137 chaff launchers, Indra Aldebaran electronic support measures (ESM) system and Raytheon AN/SLQ-32 radar jammer are yet be fitted.<br><br>SENSORS<br><br>The ship is equipped with a Raytheon AN/SPS-52C 3-D medium range air search radar, operating at E/F band, Kelvin Hughes navigation and helicopter control radar, Kelvin Hughes I-band navigation radar, MX 1105 Transit/GPS Omega satellite navigation system and an URN 25 Tacan system. The Raytheon AN/SPS-64 I-band surface search radar and Thales Nederland (fomerly Signaal) STIR I/J/K-band fire control radar are not yet fitted.<br><br>Provision has been made for a hull-mounted, medium frequency, active sonar system.<br><br>PROPULSION<br><br>Propulsion is by a Combined Diesel or Gas Turbines (CODOG) system which is made up of two pairs of GE LM-2500 gas turbines rated at 44,250hp with a power turbine speed of 3,600rpm and Izar-MTU 16V1163 TB83 diesel engines, each with an output power of 6,437hp at 1,200rpm, which will drive two variable-pitch five-blade propellers. (Thailand's two Naresuan Class frigates, which may escort the carrier, are also fitted with CODOG systems).</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>The following offers some information on the operational status. Apologies for not being able to copy the link.<br><br>Cost of running and maintenance is exhorbitant but that does not truly explain its current sorry state.<br><br><blockquote>Thailand is one of the few countries in the<br>world - and unique in the ASEAN region - to<br>have a sea-going naval air arm, and this is<br>headquartered at U-Tapao. The Royal Thai<br>Naval Air Division (Kongbin Tha Lur Thai)<br>operates ex-Spanish Navy McDonnell Douglas<br>AV-8As from its sole carrier, the Chakri<br>Narubet, built by Bazan in Spain. Seven AV-<br>8Ss and two TAV-8Ss were acquired in 1997,<br>but have suffered serviceability problems due<br>to lack of spares and only three are<br>operational today. The carrier air wing also<br>includes Sikorsky S-70B-7 Seahawks, six of<br>which were delivered in 1997. However, the<br>most potent element of the Royal Thai Naval<br>Air Division is its 14 land-based LTV A-7E/EA-<br>7Ls and four TA-7C Corsairs, acquired from ex-<br>US Navy stocks in 1995. Maritime patrol types<br>in service include two Lockheed P-3Ts and a<br>UP-3T, three Fokker F27-200 Maritime<br>Enforcers, five GAF N24L Searchmasters and<br>three Dornier Do-228-212s.<br>Other types<br>include two F27-400M transports, ten Summit<br>Sentry 337s, four Cessna 0-1s, four Cessna U-<br>17s and two Douglas C-47s, one of which is<br>configured for Elint. The RTNAD operates a<br>sizeable helicopter force, equipped with Bell<br>UH-1Hs, Bell 212s, Bell 214STs, and Sikorsky S-<br>76s. Two Agusta Westland Super Lynx 300<br>maritime helicopters are on order under a Â£25<br>million deal and will be used in the ASW,<br>surface surveillance and anti drug-smuggling<br>roles, operating from four RTN frigates and<br>offshore patrol vessels. The RTND is also<br>interested in acquiring up to ten ex-US Navy<br>Kaman SH-2F Seasprites and the US Navy had<br>offered, in early 2000, to donate eight<br>Seasprites upgraded to SH-2G standard, with<br>two SH-2Fs for spares cannibalisation.<br></blockquote></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>The Cambodian issue IIRC was over some disparaging remarks made by a Thai lady media personality. Cambodia was no longer a threat to Thailand after the Khmer Rouge was ousted. In any case, I believe the RTN didn't buy the Chakri Naruebet because of any perceived threats from Cambodia.<br><br>ATM, there is no significant external threat against Thailand; the security threat that is emerging to the forefront is from Muslim insurgents in the southern provinces. That is probably the reason behind the recent purchase of the Chinese IFV, in exchange for dried longans.</div>
