The salary of a chinese soldier is 100 times lower than a US soldier. In fact a chinese soldier would be more willing to fight, cos he has much lesser to loss than a US soldier.<br><br>In many aspect, you can say that Chinese military are getting more bangs for their bucks.<br><br>I'm not a supporter of China, whoever said that is stating an oversimplification of   the China's strength.<br><br>You have to see the big picture, not just counting how many war planes and how professional or war proven you think their military are.<br><br>If tml a war were to start between China and any country, no one can outfight or outlast China.
