            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by sgdiehard:</div><div class="quote_body">Official chinese records say very little about this incident. In a periodical "A Study of the Gansu People" dated 1999, an article written by Mr. Wang wrote about this incident, but quoted from a English missionary, who apparently quoted from the book "Islam in China and Turkistan" written by a French scholor in 1878.<br><br>According to the article, during the An Lu San rebellion, 4000 arabians soldiers under a general Kotche were sent to help the Tang emperor but they did not leave China after the rebellion. After some trouble they created in Lou Yang, the Tang emperor arranged for them to leave China for home by sea, through Canton (thats why they were in Canton). But when they arrived in Canton (now known as Guangzhou), they refused to board the ships and ganged up with the local arabs and persian merchants and occupied some warehouses. After some negotiations, they were finally were allowed to stay, married local girls....and the French author concluded that these are the forefathers of all muslims in China.<br><br>Mr. Wang, in studying into the people of Gansu, which is a province in the far west of China, had argued that there were already many muslims in Gansu and the soldiers who went to help the Tang emperor were actually the Gansu soldiers but mistaken as the arabian soldiers.<br><br>What is the truth? Scholars are arguing, but it is definitely not a battle between china and the muslims. pls don't use this and create something else.</div></blockquote>Thx for saving me the trouble~~~ <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz"><br>Yup,the record was sparse but still recorded,i am not trying to say that it is a battle between china and the muslims,just additional supplement for the readers to judge.</div>

Militarily the Chinese were easily conquered, but in the end the inevitable triumph was theirs.  The result? Both Mongol and Manchu were assimilated, and today are but footnotes in the cultural history of China. The mainlanders now consider the Meng and Man as Chinese as the Han, and the Yuan and Qing dynasties as an integral part of Chinese history.<br><br>(By the same coin, some of the sillier mainlanders will claim the honour of having sacked Baghdad through their Mongolian proxies. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"> )<br><br>In short, should the Arabs have conquered China, in short order they would have found themselves speaking Chinese and following Chinese customs.<br><br>The effect of Islamized China, however, makes for quite interesting speculation. Perhaps if Tamerlane had not perished before his planned campaign against the Ming, maybe we could have seen Islam as the predominant religon in China today.<br><br>Wait! What am I saying? Those Turkic-Mongol twits were already a vassal paying tribute to China by then. If you're looking for a clash of civilizations here, idwar, seems that you've backed the wrong horse. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br><br>(BTW, Just remembered that Tamerlane set fire to Baghdad as well.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"> </div></blockquote>Tamerlane paying tribute to the Chinese? I highly doubt that. Unless you can provide a source for that.<br><br>As for converting others to Islam, quite honestly other then the initial arabs, it took many many generations for the people to convert. Even in Asia minor, the conversion was mainly due to displacement of the local Christians then actual conversion. In Egypt, Palastine and Syrian regions, the same can be said. Especially with the Palastine and Syrian reigons. It was mainly displacement then actual convertions.<br>However in Egypt, it was a gradual conversion that took 100's of years.Like really long time. And even today there are  Christians living in those areas.(6%for Egypt and 16% for Syria,39% in Lebanon. In Palastine and Turkey they mainly moved out.)<br>In Arabia it was mainly forced conversions initially.Then again as you can see with the normadic tribes it somehow seem's easier to convert them.<br>The Turko-Mongolian tribes,the Berbers,Arabians and all that.<br></div>

Hai Rui,an official during the era renowned for his integrity and honesty,is a Hui himself,and so is admiral Zheng He,whose original surname is "Ma"~~~<br>More contemporary Hui personality would be General Bai Chongxi(KMT),who is known as "little Zhuge",and his son Bai Xian Yong,a renowned author and playwright~~~</div>

The British, Dutch, French and Portugese have fought each other both at home and in foreign lands during colonial times but that is in the past. Look at where they stand now under the common umbrella of NATO, and even in most cases sharing the same Euro currency. We should learn from history but we should not let it be a stumbling block to the future.<br><br>For what its worth, the British even fought the Americans during their War of Independence.
