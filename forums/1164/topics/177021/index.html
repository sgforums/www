            <div class='col-md body'>"United into a single empire by Islam, the Persians and Arabs brought such nautical skill and business acumen to maritime trade that by the middle of the 8th century, large merchant communities were residing in Guangzhou (Canton), the leading port of the Â‘NanhaiÂ’ trade, and Yangzhou, a transshipment point where the Grand Canal met the Yangzi River. After the An Lushan rebellion of 755 precipitated civil war in north China, cutting off the transshipment routes, the Persians and Arabs in Guangzhou simply pillaged the warehouses and sailed off with the loot. This was in 758; two years later, the tables were turned when a Tang army plundered Yangzhou while suppressing rebels, and killed thousands of Persian and Arab merchants. Most of the others then moved their trade westwards to Hanoi for nearly 40 years. From 794, Guangzhou slowly recovered its preeminence, until the next great upheaval - Huang ChaoÂ’s rebellion of 874-884. In 878, Huang captured Guangzhou and conducted a massacre of all foreigners Â– this time, the victims included Muslims, Jews, Christians and Zoroastrians."<br><br>I read the articlesn the url you provided, and the only thing I can find about Arabs in Guangzhou is this, so a bunch of Arabs opportunist merchants pillaging the city's warehouse during a period of civil strife count as as Abbassid Army sacking Guangdong?<br><br>An Lushan may be a Muslim or Turkish/Sogian from other sources, but this is a time of civil war, not clashes between two mighty empires.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>In 758, there were enough resident Arab and Persian merchants in Guangzhou (Canton) to pillage the warehouses and sail off with the loot. In 760, a Tang general led his troops into Yangzhou (another trading centre) while suppressing rebels, and masssacred thousands of Persian and Arab traders. So there were definitely large Arab communities in China. Later, there also arose Muslim militias battling each other and the central govt.<br><br>(Whenever China's central govt becqme weak, Muslim rebellions occur. There were such 5 major rebellions during the manchu Qing dynasty )<br><br>My observations is thus: What would Chinese history be like had the  Arabs managed to seize and hold Canton?

Militarily the Chinese were easily conquered, but in the end the inevitable triumph was theirs.  The result? Both Mongol and Manchu were assimilated, and today are but footnotes in the cultural history of China. The mainlanders now consider the Meng and Man as Chinese as the Han, and the Yuan and Qing dynasties as an integral part of Chinese history.<br><br>(By the same coin, some of the sillier mainlanders will claim the honour of having sacked Baghdad through their Mongolian proxies. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"> )<br><br>In short, should the Arabs have conquered China, in short order they would have found themselves speaking Chinese and following Chinese customs.<br><br>The effect of Islamized China, however, makes for quite interesting speculation. Perhaps if Tamerlane had not perished before his planned campaign against the Ming, maybe we could have seen Islam as the predominant religon in China today.<br><br>Wait! What am I saying? Those Turkic-Mongol twits were already a vassal paying tribute to China by then. If you're looking for a clash of civilizations here, idwar, seems that you've backed the wrong horse. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br><br>(BTW, Just remembered that Tamerlane set fire to Baghdad as well.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"></div>

In a periodical "A Study of the Gansu People" dated 1999, an article written by Mr. Wang wrote about this incident, but quoted from a English missionary, who apparently quoted from the book "Islam in China and Turkistan" written by a French scholor in 1878.<br><br>According to the article, during the An Lu San rebellion, 4000 arabians soldiers under a general Kotche were sent to help the Tang emperor but they did not leave China after the rebellion. After some trouble they created in Lou Yang, the Tang emperor arranged for them to leave China for home by sea, through Canton (thats why they were in Canton). But when they arrived in Canton (now known as Guangzhou), they refused to board the ships and ganged up with the local arabs and persian merchants and occupied some warehouses. After some negotiations, they were finally were allowed to stay, married local girls....and the French author concluded that these are the forefathers of all muslims in China.<br><br>Mr. Wang, in studying into the people of Gansu, which is a province in the far west of China, had argued that there were already many muslims in Gansu and the soldiers who went to help the Tang emperor were actually the Gansu soldiers but mistaken as the arabian soldiers.<br><br>What is the truth? Scholars are arguing, but it is definitely not a battle between china and the muslims. pls don't use this and create something else.</div>
