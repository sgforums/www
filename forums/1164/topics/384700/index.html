              <p>the south koreans are skinny but taller  because south korea has lots of beef...the south korean army feeds each soldier a huge steak for every meal with rice.............how many steaks do the spore SAF feed their own soldiers at lunch time???when i look at the spore army and the south korean kids..........i kind of couldnt help wondering if saf didnt give those spore kids enough meat to build the muscles.</p>
              <p>i have talked to many south koreans.......they have a less tougher army training.......their diet is way better than in spore............if the spore soldier looks skinny and malnutritioned........maybe thats because they are given meals to look like dat!....if u force  them to exercise like the south koreans.....spore kids will turn into a human skeleton.but the south koreans have an easy life mostly after national service.from internet...south korean army intends to reduce national service time...almost 1.5 years or less.and only 5 days reservist duty /year.i met one south korean marine and he didnt have any six pack.........one had long gold hair.........another was short and fat and spoke with an american accent..........they are just normal people like u and me.what u see on internet is just one or 2 regulars signin on with the korean army or want to be atheletes.......</p>
              <p>better buck up SAF....feed the kids at camps with more beef and please dun skin the reservists for that!</p>

              <p>The dark side of the pathetic <a rel="nofollow" href="/forums/10/topics/384696?page=2">‘inside story’ </a>will never be fully known for its admiration of the beefy South Korean military boys.</p>
              <p>Its stupidity is obvious in not realising that the skinny, under-fed, and shorter North Korean military had displayed the ferocity and tenacity repeatedly over the last ten years, and had beaten the muscular US Military Police stationed at Panmanjeom, and had even murdered one - whom the North Koreans had accused of crossing the line. </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Althoug beef may not be served in the form of "steaks" to the SAF, there is still the "beef rendang" in a diet regime controlled by the SAF Dietician.</p>
              <p>Unfortunately, the portions maybe controlled - as the SAF kitchens are operated by contractors with fixed operating budgets to manage, even as they will meet the standards set by the SAF Dietician.</p>
              <p>It is not much use having a bunch of "beauty boys" in the SAF - with muscles to show but an absence of a punch in any muscle-power available.</p>
              <p>The ignorance of the 'Insidestory' is clear in that muscle size does not equate to muscle power, unless those muscles are trained for specific purpose.</p>

              <p>if saf dun serve beef in the diet then asians will always be skinny...........if u see those armed forces that serve beef......most have huge muscles left n right.south koreans have plenty beef in their diet.....dats why most have better physique than sporean soldiers or even sporean reservists.</p>
              <p>never got taste of beef ever in saf meals.</p>
              <p>yesanyway insider is probably a homosexual.....first time i hear of guys comparing tummy muscles one...............must be insider iz lonely on xmas season.....maybe his period come and he got no place to vent his............perversions....:)</p>
              <p>he is one sad fuck i can tell u...rather leave him be..............he would probably die of AIDS or malnutrition due to lack of jobs.</p>

              <p>ya need strength to fight a bear or alsatian dog.the ones with more muscles are able to kill a wolf by whacking it with a diet of beef from young.their physique would be more intimidating in the chest and arm muscles.those are the muscles needed to snap or break a jaw instantly from an animal.they would also be better at enduring extreme conditions.</p>
