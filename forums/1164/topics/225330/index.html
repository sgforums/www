            <div class='col-md body'>No, even now i think it will be a tough fight should China engage the US alone. I'm not sure about the PLAN capabilities to launch a land invasion of the US but i can say that the US will be severely whacked and their economy might just crumble (which it already is slowly...)<br><br>China may not have the best weapons, but they certainly do have the numbers. Just like Vietnam, the people didnt have an advanced airforce yet they could still deal lethal blows to the US armed forces. Now if the EU backs China up. GG for US. ICBMs with conventional warheads will start flying. how many can their patriots block?<br><br>If the US does have a very strong economy to back up its war efforts against the world in this Simulation, The US have indeed a very advanced fighting force and might suprise some of us of its capabilities.<br><br>Assuming that the US and the Rest of the world have adequate resources to sustain the war effort, the US can really put up a fight for some time. Ultimately it will be a numbers game. Who has more will win. Certainly a few hundred million people versus 1 billion ppl the outcome could be quite obvious.</div>
