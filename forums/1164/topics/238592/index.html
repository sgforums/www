            <div class='col-md body'>The Thunder Run<br><br>'Are you kidding, sir?': Fewer than 1,000 soldiers were ordered to capture a city of 5 million Iraqis. Theirs is a story that may become military legend.<br><br>By David Zucchino<br><br>Nine hundred and seventy-five men invading a city of 5 million sounded audacious, or worse, to the U.S. troops assigned the mission outside Baghdad last April 6. Ten years earlier, in Mogadishu, outnumbered American soldiers had been trapped and killed by Somali street fighters. Now some U.S. commanders, convinced the odds were far better in Iraq, scrapped the original plan for taking Baghdad with a steady siege and instead ordered a single bold thrust into the city. The battle that followed became the climax of the war and rewrote American military doctrine on urban warfare.<br><br>Back home, Americans learned of the victory in sketchy reports that focused on the outcomeÂ—a column of armored vehicles had raced into the city and seized Saddam Hussein's palaces and ministries. What the public didn't know was how close the U.S. forces came to experiencing another Mogadishu. Military units were surrounded, waging desperate fights at three critical interchanges. If any of those fell, the Americans would have been cut off from critical supplies and ammunition.<br><br>Embedded journalists reported the battle's broad outlines in April, but a more detailed account has since emerged in interviews with more than 70 of the brigade's officers and men who described the fiercest battle of the warÂ—and one they nearly lost.<br><br>Times staff writer David Zucchino, who was embedded with Task Force 4-64 of the 2nd Brigade, 3rd Infantry Division (Mechanized), returned to the United States recently to report this story.<br><br>Too long to post, but worth reading<br><br><a href="http://209.157.64.200/focus/f-news/1047134/posts" rel="nofollow">http://209.157.64.200/focus/f-news/1047134/posts</a></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>These few things stand out for me:<br><br>1. RPG is a force multiplier not to be sniffed at.  Almost all problems were due to RPG strikes at Humvees and supply trucks.  Even the M1 tank operations were restricted due to supply problems.<br><br>2. The opfor were not regular Army, but religous groups and some Syrians (?).<br><br>3. There were some very dedicated opfor.  Watching your vehicle formation blown one by one, by tank rounds and still charge ahead against armoured vehicles takes a different level of dedication.<br><br>4. Lack or insufficient div level commanders on the opfor side help things somewhat.<br><br>5. There is no mention of air support.  Restricted due to political reasons or not available?</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Pretty amazing they managed to pull it off with such minimal losses... they really, really had things going for them despite all the close shaves. Imagine how easy was it to become another Black Hawk Down or worse, the disasterous first few Russian battles in Gronzy.</div>
