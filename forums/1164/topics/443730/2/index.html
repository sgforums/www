              Don't think China's into HEL yet, last reports say they're more focused on Metal Storm type weapons for the time being. In a way a smart move, they know they can't out tech the US for now, so they're focusing on lower tech countermeasures instead. (i.e not trying to get an advantage over the US, but remove the US's advantages instead).
              
              As for stopping the carrier, no big deal, carriers have to turn to the wind and cut speed to carry out flight ops anyhow, it's just a question of if a HEL is practical to be used as a weapon. HELs also can't hit anything below the horizon, the beam goes in a straight line (more or less), once a target is below the curvature of the Earth, it can't be targetted while missiles can still home in on them.

              The unfortunate part of HELs on ships is that they draw a hellish lot of power, off the top of my head, the only ships currently capable of mounting a laser is the nuclear powered Zumwalt, and that's only going to be commissioned in 3 years.
              
              And Milo, I mentioned weaker laser power in atmosphere, the power needed to cut through armour is fearsomely high, right now, a single Harpoon missile deals magnitudes more damage than any laser produced. Look at the small boat in your article, they only managed to set the outboard motor on fire. A Harpoon missile on that boat and you'd have trouble even finding the pieces. 
              
              The most fearsome weapon against a CVBG is still the anti-ship missile. Which is why I'm still a proponent of a Singaporeanized version of the SC21 program.
              
              Missiles
              
              1) Don't lose damage over range
              2) Can hit targets "over the horizon"
              3) Can manuver around obstacles to hit the target
              4) Can be launched in an "Alpha Strike" (i.e Fired everything at once) and at many targets
              5) Have a blast radius, so does not require a direct hit.
              
              Lasers
              
              1) Can't be intercepted
              2) Do not need ammo
              3) Do not need to reload
              
              But unfortunately lasers still have too many weaknesses to be used as weapons by themselves.

              Well, they may have to stop if they have trouble targetting and focusing. If they're using a multi-diode beam in order to avoid high energy dispersion, the multiple beams have to converge, and it is easier to focus if both you and the target are not moving. But that's just guesswork, if the software's good, I don't see any reason to stop too.
              
              Correction on the "can't be intercepted", heavy smoke or chaff can hinder the beam.
