Everything your close friend, haha maybe later we will find out he only junior mech with a few yrs, who is not in a position to comment.<br><br>Crashing into mountain is not a plane fault, it is pilot and nagivation error moron !!! Mercedes crashes in the road everyday, so Mercedes not good is it.<br><br>A-4 skyhawk can go 90 degree vertical and do it very beautifully, look at how graceful the black knights do it.<br><br>A-4 had been a good fighter bomber, which can do the job. With at new engine and upgrades, it go a little improvement. Look at the planes around the region at that time, what is there to match it ? The airforce been smart, they use their money wisely to buy F-16s and save the rest, so that now we can get good replacement for the A-4SU - look at what we are looking at - F15, Ralafe and Eurofigther. If we have follow you and your so call idiot expert suggestion, we would got mirage 2000 instead of upgrading the A-4, now we be talking of upgrading the mirage2000 and not buying new planes.<br><br>Look A-4 is favourablely name the "scooter".  Look at our real live environment,all pizza and other food delivery they use scooters, they do their job, did their delievery. If based on your nut concept, let us BMW car as it can go "vertical" speed. Yes you did your delivery but at what cost, and how long can your business stay open ?</div>

Wow very high !!!<br><br>Sorry ours folks here are Army Ranks not NCC ranks. Even let you compare NCC to Army directly, your rank still loses a lot of us !<br><br>You already proven yourself to be a pain in the ass and sotong, you go army will forever think you know better and will not learn much, because you already shown here. You already totally argued with a lot of military experts in their own area of speciality and still did not wake up your ideals, how are you going to improve and learn, you already closed your mind.<br><br>I am telling you, I alway get to see the skyhawks in action a lot, they sure can come low and fast and using convention bomb totally on target. They come so fast and low, even with a stinger, there is very little chance of you even getting a aim at them. Not to talk about the more advance guide missiles can carry. Cannot defend itself, the US top gun instructors will tell you how Skyhawk give F14 and F18 a run for there money.<br><br>Scooter slow then car ? In city and traffic jam - a scooter alway faster. Also scooter can easily park car very hard must find carpark. You get 1 car + driver, with 1/2 that cost, I get 20 scooter + drivers, so who will win the delivery war.<br><br>Use your brain, and not simple compare dead data from maginzes and what hear say.</div>

Rank to rank you still lost to us folks here.<br><br>You see singapore just one little dot, your dad pay so little tax, so money is constrainted.  You big NCC baby who read magzine want newest big ship, newest planes, newest tech.  Old one still working well, complain and complain, but when ask you where get money to buy, go to NCC fund is it , you higher den staff searge sign for it right .<br><br>A-4 is a ground attack plane, it does not need a extremely good radar, as air coverage is by hawkeye and fighter support like F16s. So what tested F22 feel it is good, no money to buy also must buy is it is it, NCC fund to sponsor it again. Complain some more, last time you have A-4 that time, a lot other countries does not even have planes that can fly. So Singapore upgrade things very lousy is it, still dare to say here your 7 NCC core values blah blah ..... later you get hang as traitor !<br><br>You judge things too much by cover, go malaysia see see lah ! You see proton, think proton lousy, your dad car also lose proton ok. A lot of malaysia proton, engine overhaul and customized, outside like proton but can beat any car anytime.<br><br>Wow try to compare what you do in NCC with army, what you do in NCC is only playing marbles lah ! One saturday morning every week, and walk in here to talk big, soldier here 2 and 1/2 yr everyday, also never walk in here talk big like that. I will leave you to learn it yourself and others here to tell you.<br></div>

With your limited brain capacity i doubt you know that the Israelis were big-time users of the skyhawk during their wars with the arabs. THe argentinians used their skyhawks efficitively against the british task force during the Falklands war. The brazillians recently purchased a number of A-4KU for operation on carrier. Who say we are the only ones operating the skyhawk?<br>The upgraded A-4SU flew in 1988 and with its upgraded F404, which is a non-afterburning version of the the F404 used in the F/A-18, its performance surprised many.<br>Even if there were any bugs, surely 16 years is  more than enough to iron them out.<br><br>You wanna compare NCC to NS? Goodness! Its jus some child's play thingy and you wanna compare with NS? Prepare to be flamed!</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>yep, its almost half a decade old, so what's the diff between the b52 that you said you loved and the skyhawk? b52 carry nukes? skyhawks can carry tactical nukes too, but since we don't have and should never consider those, then your rubbish is more unfounded. comparing planes to audio storage media? those got from tape to mp3 in slightly over ten years. planes got from prop to jet to anti-gravity to warp drive to worm-hole engine in 10years? got from detection by sigth, to radar, to psychic in 10years? weapons got developed from guns to cannons to missles to nuke to laser to particle beam to deathstar super laser in even 50years? no way. fact remains that most of the world still use the stuff they had 10years ago. the f22 budget remains in doubt because some senators feel there's no need to have a $120 million dollar advanced fighter because there are no foes. yes, there is a need to develop new tech, but it doesn't mean singapore must have everything the best. are you the kind who would buy a ferrari and then have no money left to get anything more than a 2room HDB flat? the military isn't everything in singapore. if you want sg to get everything the best in military, go ahead and earn your billions of dollars, then pay tax. we'll all be happy. as for the skyhawk having bad record? honestly, if your friend is right about the 10planes in 10years record, i would be quite impressed<br>considering how dangerous flying itself is, and the more than 150 skyhawks the RSAF has, over 10years, that's very good. don't forget in 7years 3 f16s have crashed, and as far as i know, even 2 F22s have gone down. flying is a risky business, there WILL have to be acceptable loses. as someone from speaker's corner said, the only way an airforce can have zero loses is to ground all its planes and not fly at all.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>You can carry on waste time to argue on the A4.<br><br>Because everyday that the Singapore A4SU will take to the sky is prove that you are wrong. That be around 3-4 years till the new fighters is delivered. Since it is a decision of the Air Force, that mean a decision of your superior ! unless you think you are smarter then the whole airforce then carry on talk in your negative views. You would have violated your own NCC 7 core values, which is desrespectful to your superiors, and we can shoot you with M16s ( of course don't worry M16s also from skyhawk days, if according to your SibeiSuayKia theory - they anicent weapon, will be useless now and will not be able to shoot to hit you ).<br><br>Maybe if someone can provide SibeiSuayKia address, we can arrange a fly-by of 2 skyhawk each day over his house early each morning, to remind him of  so call "piece of crap" still can fly. Better still, when the final day comes we will arm all the skyhawks to full load, and do a all skyhawks fly-by.
