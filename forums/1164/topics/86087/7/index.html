If we will to look into the requirements of a CAS aircraft, the A-4SU dont not need to pull such demanding Gs as required for a Figther aircraft in dogfight. What we need, is a small aircraft capable of carrying a large load (relative to her size), have huge endurance in both range and loitering capability. The A-4 have it all.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote>A4-concept was in 1950+<br>whereelse Harrier II ...is in 1970+ same age as F-16 and F-18<br>IMHO A-4 should have been phrased out due to it's weak airframe and inability to pull Gs.. even though with advanced avionics<br><br>it is the equivalent of upgrading a WWII Spitfire aircraft with ability to fire AIM-120 AMRAAM<br><br>The Harrier II is better then the A4-SU is many aspects..<br>for example the Harrier II does not require runways.<br><br>Just imagine..if a guerilla group manage to steal a Harrier II jet and operate it against the police force in the area..<br><br>They can VTOL ... hit and run... come out from hidden locations..conduct ambushes..<br><br>The most significant edge is indeed still VTOL , i must stress..<br>Helicopters are also VTOL ... but why a fighter jet VTOL?<br><br></blockquote>haiz....<br>the harrier can stay vertical for no more then 30 secs during it's entire flight time so it is highly impossible for a bunch of ppl to use it as a hit and run platform.This is due to the fact that the engine has to be cooled by WATER while it is in vertical flight and<br>Next up...the A4 pulls 6+G's and the AV8B pulls 8+G's.<br>Take off weight of the AV8B is maxed at around 14,000kg and it's max vertical take off weight is around 9,400kg while it's normal max take off is 14,000. It's empty weight is around 6,700kg.It's max internal fuel load is around 3,500. doing some maths with it's max internal fuel load u get 9,400-6,700-3,500=-800....meaning u cannot take of vertically with max fuel.So let's say we half that u get 950kg!!!Enough for 1 2000lbs(ard 900kg)bomb!!Let's say u give it a clean STOL take off using max fuel and max take off weight u get 14,000-6,700-3,400=3900kg or 4 bombs and maybe 1 or 2 Aim-9's<br>Now we look at the A4M. Max take off weight is around 11,500kg.It's weight is around 4,700 empty.Since i cannot find out how much it's max fuel weight is ill assume it is the same as the AV8B to give it a fair guess. That's 3,500. So we have 11,500-4,700-3,500=3300kg or around 3 bombs and 2 Aim-9's.<br><br>Max range is 277km for the harrier and 3,307km for the A4<br><br>Oh wait i just found some good stats for a better comparasion rather then my lame maths  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br>AV8B<br>7711 kg (17,000 lb) or VTO total of 3175 kg (7,000 lb) of weapons on 6 hard points<br>A4<br>2268 kg of weapons on 5 hardpoints.<br>i think this is for the standard load becuz i'm sure the A-4 can carry more if it had less fuel. Also this is the standard A4 and not our A4SU which i think has better engines and thus carrying ability.<br><br>So far most websites have this to say.<br>The AV8B and the British Pegasus(which is better) are CAS planes and usually is best used with 120km range and with 12 MK82 bombs with 1 drop tank and 1 hr flight time.For CAP it usually is loaded up with 200km range and 4 Aim9's and 2 Aim120's<br><br>My personal Opinion<br>The Harrier is a good CAS plane with it's STOL and VTOL capabilites.However it's range is extermely limited and it's role is way way to specialize for it to be cost effective for us.So i think buying it will not be good since it is going to be replaced by the JSF which we mayb get anyway.The A4 is an old bird...and has served us really well in the early days as a CAP plane and now as a CAS plane.Though it may not have the VTOL ability of the harrier it's longer range(thus longer loiter time) is great for us as it make it easier for us to keep the plane in the bloody air instead of landing it to refuel like the harrier.The harrier if it has to keep landing will then have to either use up it's stores or carry up less....ALOT less.Either that or refuel in the air which i think wont be as good becuz it's not very efficient.Since the A4's are going to be replaced by the NGF's with the F-16's taking over the role of CAS,i see no reason to get the harrier at all.<br><br>Anyway back on topic<br>The LST's are used at support ships and what not.So having choppers on them wld be alot better then having harriers on them since the RSAF can provide all the air cover needed.If it cannot then we're screwed anyway.</div>

Have more respect for the A-4 , it is one mean machine which any pilot whether F15, F14, F18, F16 or harrier, will give a lot of respect. This is one mean plane that have proven itself in vietnam and middle east. It is also used in the Top gun school, the old trainees and instructors from there will laugh till death, if you tell them the Skyhawk cannot pull Gs !!!

Look at all the famous strike bombers -  intruders they are little in Gs, but they get their job done. Yep next you be writing to US airforce to tell them to about Gs - B52 is no good, for lack of Gs.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>one thing...sibeisuaykia, if we are to get planes which can pull the 9gs an f16 can, can you find more pilots that can pull a sustained 9G? currently, with our mixed figther fleet, the main barrier for pilots to get into the f16, is the 9g requirement. right now, not all of the f5 or a4 guys can withstand the 9gs. what will happen when the f5 and a4 is replaced by craft like the eurofighter than go to 9g+? results in a situation where the planes will not be flying to their full capabilities(at first at least.). currently already RSAF short of pilots, and no way are they going to lower their standards to get more guys in. besides, what's the point when you need guys who can pull sustained 9g?</div>
