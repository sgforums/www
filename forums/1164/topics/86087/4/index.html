Radar cannot be in middle of jungle, why, the trees total block it. Next sam missiles batteries cannot be in middle of jungle, need a lot of clearance for missile to take flight. Yep in middle of jungle plane cannot see you, don't forget the branches and leaves also prevent you from seening them, and cannot shoot missile as will hit branches.<br><br>So what if i destory the tankers ? Hello , that mean you don't have fuels !!! You think plane come, then you run to start up all you Sam batteries right !!! The sam is on now and then to wait, these use up fuels - same as tanks, you have to warm up now and then, not wait till action which is too late.  Unless you are converting durain to fuel. You just totally have useless tanks and sams without fuel.<br><br>Go read your history, the Japanese use roads to move their tanks, they have combat engineer to open roads.  If there is apache, the jap tanks be hit ?<br></div>

They are on recon mission and not rescue mission for goodness sake.<br><br>U are more likely to walk right into a tree but not the UAV which will be flying above the trees.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>IMHO i will not be sending my AH64 for recon mission. That's the job for scouts and UAVs.<br><br>As some of the guys had mentioned it is unlikely to hide a ABG in the jungle. Let say I'm the commander. And if I really have a good reason to suspect that there is a whole group of tanks hiding there. I would have call for artillery bombardment on the whole area before I advance my troops forward.  A few hundreds cargo shells should be able to do the job.   Don't worry about the AH64.  I'll have better things for it to do.<br><br>There is no perfect weapon.  The main thing is to use the right thing for the right job. U use spoon for rice but u can't say a knife is useless. Its good for ur steak right? But again a spoon will be useless if u are eating steak.<br>Its a mix and match thing.<br><br></div>
