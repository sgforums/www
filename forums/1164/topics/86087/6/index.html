            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by Obersturmfuhrer:</div><div class="quote_body">This thread has degenerated into a circus. Not only has the topic shifted drastically, there are also many misleading and irrelevant information posted as well. Although it's quite hilarious to read, I think it's about time to lock it.</div></blockquote>Ok ok ... back to the topic. Hey at least its about navy stuff ...   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br><br>From The StrategyPage<br><br><strong>Rail Gun Approaching Regular Use</strong><br><br>July 13, 2004: The U.S. Navy is energetically, and at great expense, developing a revolutionary  next generation  warship weapon; the rail gun. Instead of using explosives to propel a shell out of a gun barrel, a rail gun uses magnetism to speed a projectile along two rails. This requires a lot of electricity, and for that reason, the new class of surface warships (DD-X and CG-X) are being built with sufficient electrical generating capacity to support a rail gun. While rail guns have been working in labs for years, it will be another 5-10 years before they will be ready for installation on a working warship. But when the rail gun does become reliable enough for this, it will be an awesome weapon. Generating six to 30 times the energy of current five inch (127mm) naval shells. The rail gun Â“dartsÂ” will travel at about 1.5 kilometers a second, to a range of of to 450 kilometers (depending on the amount of energy applied to the rails). When  the dart hits the ground, after spending up to five minutes in flight, it would bury itself 40 feet down, and leave a crater ten feet wide and ten feet deep. If the dart hits a tank, the vehicle is destroyed. A DD-X could carry 10,000 of these 127mm, 44 pound Â“guided dartsÂ” in the space now allocated for 1,500 110 pound 127mm shells and their propellant charges, and fire them at the rate of six a minute. One of the things slowing down introduction of rail guns is a guidance system that can survive the high acceleration of the dart (from sitting still to over 5,000 kilometers an hour in a second or two.) U.S. weapons researchers have built guidance systems, at great expense,  that can operate in a conventional artillery shell. But the rail gun projectile is moving more than twice as fast. Moreover, these 44 pound, 127mm Â“guided dartsÂ” will be expensive, costing up to $5-10,000 each. That means a DD-X could be carrying $100 million worth of munitions for its rail gun. However, the navy feels that the rail gun will provide weapons that are cheaper than missiles, but still have the long range and accuracy that missiles possess.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>First you must know the job requirement of the LSTs. The LST's capability is set so that it can perform amphibous operation from a small to low medium scale. Amphibous operation require the support of alot of CAS and heli support. Helicopters are required to carry vital logistic goods, equipments, SOFs or even for the fast dispatch of troops to one spot. So if the Harriers or the JSF will to be deployed on the LSTs, where our helicopter will going to go?<br><br>Our LSTs will only perform amphibous landings in area of interest within the reach of our fighters. It is possible to sent frequent and constant waves of fighters afar to the area of interest however it is near impossible to sent frequent and constant waves of support helicopter. Thus seeing the fact that the call of a helicopter support is vital and unpredictable at any one time, it is more feasible to deploy helicopter on board.<br><br>Base on the range of our support bombers, the A-4 certainly can cover a range of 1000km or less without any trouble. Thus dun worry about theatre air support, it can be provided by deployments from our home base.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote>even pakistani with thier old kind of airforce stuff...can shoot that damned UAV india has..and the UAV is bought from israel</blockquote>As what i had said, you do not need a technologically advanced force to shoot down UAVs. Primitive methods like hunting UAV using eye sight by riding on a helicopter can be done by any airforce, thus nothing to be astonish about. UAVs are vulnerable to a certain extent, however years of UAV operations in countless of battles proved the worth of UAVs.<br><br><blockquote>singapore's UAV as a matter of fact is bought from israel too</blockquote>Our UAV inventory is a secret. Of corse we have models from Israel, other than that, no one is willing to talk about.<br><br><blockquote>they work on those ...areas which i know and im not going to say..</blockquote>I think i know more about UAV than you. Dun ask me why, im not going to say. I believe a number of us here do.<br><br><blockquote>Those UAV are known to crash..many of times in fact and<br>each UAV crash costs 1.5 million</blockquote>That is a generalisation and it is not true. Take that a UAV searcher MK2 cost about 7.5million, a Global hawk cost also about 7.5million?<br><br><blockquote>these UAV also has a limited range...and life..can only go for few hundred km</blockquote>That is depending on what UAV u are talking about. ST plan to build a MAV-1 which have a range of a regular fighter. The Global hawk have a range of about 300 Nautical miles.<br><br><blockquote>and UAV since can be shot down by PAF ..which uses those AA guns and Ak-47..im just assuming that UAV itself..nah ain't very good</blockquote>I think AK-47 is impossible. Unless the UAV flies at 200 meter from the ground, so that you can see it or you ride an helicopter and burn the UAV from the heli's cabin.<br><br><blockquote>Never saw a RSAF black color UAV before. =)<br><br>to me UAV is just a modified version of the remote control plane which has camera lens.<br>unless ur talking about global hawk or predator..</blockquote>Wrong, the MAV-1 is black in colour. I think you have a very primitive view on UAVs. Too bad, new generation UAV isnt just a remote control plane which have cameras.<br><br><blockquote>stupid searcher is so outdated liaoz..zz..PAF has so much land to cover yet oso can shoot down..</blockquote>It still fits our requirement.<br><br><blockquote>haiz whats the point of doing recon...with a 1.5million plane..anyway the UAV is gonna be obsolete soon..</blockquote>I am telling you that it is not 1.5 million dollar.<br><br><blockquote>Far away from SG got good points<br>-stop possibility of pre-empts<br>-out of range from fighter jets..without KC-135</blockquote>It is within range of our F-16s with 600gallon tanks and our A-4SUs.<br><br><blockquote>Near to SG oso quite good<br>-strike timing needs just 5 minutes to form a formation<br>-Near to SG bombers.<br>-Increased vulnearability<br>-SG unable to detect build up of forces due to air defense presense</blockquote>Wrong, athough u can just need 5 minutes of formation. Once you are up, we can take u down with the I-hawk. We dun have to use UAV to detect air defense formation, Sat-intell and Humint will do the trick.<br><br>the only few things i like about SAF is..<br><br><blockquote>KC-135..good oil tanker on the air..but need escorts =/<br>AWACs...<br>Apache..not really like lar..but the jungle enviroment i dun think is good</blockquote>The apaches were first designed to fight the soviet in temperate forest of eastern europe. So it speaks of it's capability to fight in the forest. No point using the apache to fight in Jungle, it will too thick for tanks to manoveur.<br><br><blockquote>i oso don't think the Fearless PV is that good..<br>last time got a navy poster..<br>but i don't like..coz the ship small  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br>so i replaced it with a HUGE nitmitz aircraft carrier poster<br>more majestic and chio</blockquote>What is a PV? You need a frigate as a PV? U know nuts!<br></div>

If you are saying that with the bombs, the A-4 get tougher to fly, it goes the same with the Harriers.<br><br><blockquote>A Fully loaded A4-SU without bombs would leave very little stuff for bombs..<br>i read up and the 1 or 2 smart bomb considering u use each 2000 pounds<br>don't forget if carry max payload ..the plane might sometimes not be able to take it</blockquote>As i said, the take off weight of the A-4 is larger than the Harrier. No point toking about how little a A-4 can carry and suggest a harrier. Btw, you had seem to forgot totally about our F-16s, what make you think that we wont send them..<br><br><blockquote>A4-SU cannot carry multiple bomb rack if u equip it with other weapons and fuel tanks..that if it a trouble happens and A4-SU might need to defend itself when enemy planes come</blockquote>Comeon, in any CAS operation, there will be escorting figthers. What make you so sure that your harriers dun have to defend itself or what make you sure that your harriers can defend itself much better? Any CAS fighter will lose out to Figthers delicated to wipe them off....<br><br>My point is even with harriers or with A-4SUs, you still need figther cover. Thus why propose an aircraft which is much expensive than the A-4SU and yet carry a lower weight. Since our A-4SUs can do a better job and air cover is always required, let it be.<img src></div>
