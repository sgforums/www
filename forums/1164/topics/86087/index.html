The combine attack by Nato forces on Mainland China can crippled HER. Maybe you can count how many aircraft carrier / Aircrafts are there in the NATO.

            <div class='col-md body'>way i see it 4 more frigates should be enough for our needs...the Swedish Visby(sic) would be a good choice.Honestly...it could also save us the need for new long range air defence missiles and thus save us alot of money!</div>
