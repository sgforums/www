            <div class='col-md body'><strong>LOL den i think they painted A-10 Warthog and Apache AH-64 D longbow with the WRONG Color LOL!!</strong><br><br>The A-10s and Apaches were designed to fly and fight at very low altitude, nap of the earth condition. Painting it white or light greys thus make no great difference. However painting it green have a camoflage effect as the aircraft manoveurs just above or among trees *if possible. The green outfit also camoflage the aircraft against the bottom tress from predator enemy aircraft from above.<br><br>At some point of time, they actually painted the A-10 grey, i believe thats for temperate or snow field, but they do sent them for forestry excercise and if im not wrong also to the Gulf war.<br><br><blockquote>Fly high?? LOL the UAV is Defenceless duck flying in the whole sky..</blockquote>The point is, UAVs are hard to detect by radar and your Mark1 eyeball. A UAV instructor once told me that it is impossible to spot our SearcherMK2 using visual sighting when it flies at a height of 4000m. Depending on the range, but the general statement is, the radar signature of the Searcher is that of a crane. Thus try to figure out how hard it is to detect it, spot it, shoot it.<br><br><blockquote>even pakistani air force ( we know how good it is   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"> )<br>Searcher II managed to down a India's UAV</blockquote>Although they are various ways to down a UAV, it is still extremely hard. In every conflict, even armed figthers get shot down, so lets not talk about UAV. And btw, the most effective method against UAV imho is using damm primitive methods like what the serbs actually do, so you dun need a technologically advanced force to do it. Im not at all surprise the pakistani can shoot it down, neither i am surprise that the Indian's do make good surveillence with the UAV.<br><br></div>

Suddenly your gun getting bigger and bigger !<br><br>So what a UAV is shot down, that why a UAV is send moron, if not so risky that it have a high chance of being shoot down, they would have send plane with pilot. By the way it is not that easy to spot or even by radar a UAV.<br><br>Apache fly NOE which is terrain hugging, they are design to hover behind trees and pop up to fire their tow missiles. That is why they are green ! You just failed your basic camo knowledge. UAV is usually sky color when they are operating in the daylight against the sky, but for night operations, you will see black color ones.<br><br>UAV is not your neighbour hood shop radio control plane, it is equipped to operate even at night, that mean it have night and thermal sensor that can penerate haze and fog ! World armies already all using handheld thermal and night vision. The whole damn world know that UAV already have that type of technology on it except you !<br><br>Your damn arguement of even missile can be down, did you see USA planes or UAV dropping like flies in wars ?<br><br>You bloody know nothing of jamming !!!.  You think just enemy get one right frequency to UAV or plane and all is jammed ? Nowaday, planes and UAV have equipment that use such techniques as Frequency Hopping and Spread Spectrum technology to circumvent the effects of ECM jamming.<br><br>ICBM, man you make easy as go super market and buy one. Go buy a rocket to send yourself to mars better ! Biological and chemical, why you imagine, that shoot missile, missile hit enemy city and all die and we win. Imature fool ! It is just too much instable and uncontrollable for it use. Because the country that uses it have a high chance of getting it back themselves, look at how SAR and bird flu. You cannot stop wind change, birds, animals, people and water from carrying back the Biological or chemical agent back to Singapore.<br><br>You just proved to the whole world, how imatured you are again.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I'm not one for calling names but your arguments have a volatile nature. It seems that you will only be satisfied if you join the US Army instead coz, no hardware currently utilised by the SAF seems to be of your liking, perhaps because MINDEF felt someone else's ideas were better?<br><br>It also seems to me that you think of each combat equipment in terms of independent operation and discounted the synergistic effects of two or more combat elements, ie JOINT operations.<br><br>Personally, I find your lack of respect for reconnaisence elements quite offensive. I dun think YOU can do any better if we let you out there with the equipment. These guys dun deserve such treatment when they have to risk their lives operating behind enemy lines just so you can go home at the end of the day and tell your family how smart and heroic you are.<br><br>Btw, you really need to update your physics textbooks.
