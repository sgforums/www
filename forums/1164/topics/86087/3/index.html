(i'm guessing here) but i doubt its armoured.<br><br>yes one kamikaze prob wouldnt sink an aircraft carrier today but thats cos the deck is strengthened to withstand the take offs and landing of planes, including the heavier ones like the E-2C... not really because its supposed to withstand an SSM slamming into it...<br><br>in fact, if an SSM doesnt sink the A/C, the A/C is also as good as out of action already, if aircraft cannot take off or land on it, its worthless already, doesnt even have to be sunk entirely...<br><br>with all that jet fuel around, having ANYTHING slam into the aircraft carrier and jolting it such that jet fuel leaks or is sparked is a very big risk...<br><br>to have some figures back up the idea that a aircraft carrier is not likely to be armoured:<br><br>Maersk Pointer<br>Tanker<br>Length: 244.6 m<br>Beam: 42 m<br>DWT: 110,000 tonnes<br><br>USS George Washington<br>Aircraft Carrier<br>Length: 332.85 m<br>Beam: 40.84 m<br>Displacement (full load): approx 100,000 tonnes<br><br>notice that despite the USS George Washington being much longer, it is likely to be lighter than the Maersk Pointer.  Most of the weight of a tanker is taken up by oil, which fill most of the ship's space, but an aircraft carrier has alot more "empty space" aboard because it is meant to be inhabited..  Even taking this into consideration, the George Washington is still has a much greater displacement compared to the Pointer...<br><br>the comparison of these two ships is not as effective as i would like it to be because the disparity is not very great... perhaps if someone could find more examples we would have a more conclusive answer.<br><br>Note:<br>in doing these comparisons, we are of case assuming that armour would factor heavily into the weight and therefore the displacement of the ship concerned.<br><br>but in the end, we cant be sure, just keep guessing, however, basically i doubt the carriers are armoured.</div>

Plus, AFVs/IFVs do not operate alone and are not tasked to operate against heavy armour.</div>
