A squadron providing a 2nd strike capability? You got to be joking. The only true way to defend against a strike at airbases or airfields is to pre-empt them. Hit them before they get it off.

And the result? More money. And also, so what if there is more armour? It's just like building thicker hulls for aircraft so that crushes will not be that bad. How thick can your armour go? It might protect the ship, its crew, but once a ship suffers a direct hit from a missile, it is hardly combat effective anymore.  I think it is wiser to use the money to build more ships, not invest on armour.<br><br>And why compare an M-1 with a Bionix? The Abrams is a main battle tank while the Bionix is an IFV.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"> Why not a the Bionix with the Bradley?<br><br>Rpg 'completely vaporize' Bionix?

            <div class='col-md body'>Building a warship is an exercise in engineering and if you've never encountered engineering issues before here's the deal. Engineering is an exercise in compromises. Nobody these days works with unlimited funds unless you're working for Marvel Comic's S.H.I.E.L.D organisation. So we can chuck out any solutions with nuclear-powered powerplants and stick with diesel turbine engines.<br><br>Let's do a review of your emphasis on armor.<br>More armor = more mass on a ship<br><br>As any physics guy will know,<br>more mass = need more power to drive that thing and maneuver<br><br>more power = bigger/more efficient/more powerful engines/powerplants<br><br>Also since you're carrying more weight and need more power, it's safe to assume it should consume more fuel than a less armored warship of similar size and same powerplant.<br><br>more fuel = more space needed to put in fuel = less space for weapons and personnel and other cool stuff you need to make war = less capable ship.<br><br>Since we're assuming missile attacks which can cut any thickness of armor down to size, the best compromise is to make the hull just a little more thick enough for structural integrity for operational parameters. Or at least make the "armor" thick enough to withstand small arms fire.<br><br>All these are factors which are addressed by engineers and designers. Navies deliver specs; designers deliver a design based on specs and engineers do the hardwork of trying to figure out the actual implementation from the designs. And all have to be within the Navy's budget.<br><br>From my very simplified analysis, armor doesnt work. The only credible implementation I can think of to increase warship safety when hit by a missle is to have a double hull, a lot of compartmentalisation, and a crew which is highly trained in damage control just like they do in Typhoon class submarines.<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by SibeiSuayKia:</div><div class="quote_body">ECM doesn't work 100% and A-MM doesn't always hit the missile<br><br>The last bet would be a ARMOR , if u got thicker armor , more lifes saved , thin armor more pple die<br><br>using a M1 Abrams and a Bionix as a example ,<br>which tank would u prefer to sit inside in time of a war?<br><br>A M1 tanks in which has been tested with RPG 7 and Bullets and cannons<br><br>or a locally built ST Bionix 17.5 tonnes newbie?<br><br>i'll take the M1 Tank , thank you =) just compare the thickness of the armor!<br><br>anyway the delta frigates are definitely going to be made of plastics..<br><br>anyway i believe the bionix was build to counter rifle shots and pistol fire<br>and not for countering RPG -7 ...<br><br>Anyone here did a TESTING of RPGs on Bionix?<br>care to share a little of the results?<br><br>my bet would be the rpg would completely vaporize the bionix</div></blockquote></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>sibeisuaykia, you're one big cock-talker. cannot train our guys in SIGINT to speak malay? even my chinese parents can speak malay. beside, even though they're malaysia, they also not as stupid as you to use malay in their military network. why do police wear bullet proof vests? because bullets can do damage to them. why don't ships have substantial armour? sorry ah, the battleship age was like 50years ago. missles of today are designed to do a pop-up manouvere before hitting the top or the superstructure of the ship, which would be super impractical to armour against missles. i guess only in your dreams could windows withstand an exocet's huge warhead. yes, awacs can stay airborne for a very long time, and with rotating shifts there is coverage 100% of the time, and that exactly is the reason why RSAF didn't get any fewer than 4 hawkeyes. oh, and yes, awacs can and do track sea and surface targets. how do you think the fokker 50s can fire their over the horizon harpoon missles? bionix get hit by an rpg will be destroyed? you think mindef is some dumb cock ah? doyou even know what rpg stands for? its a rocket-propelled-GRENADE. if it hits a blackhawk's rotors, definatly will crash, but pls, a bionix? an ARMOURED-personel-carrier getting destroyed by a rpg? no way. and if you're thinking why armour a bionix and don't heavily armour a ship, you obviously can't compare shells and rpgs to harpoon missles.<br><br>personally, one thing the RSN should look into and try to get is a sea based airborne attack unit. just like what the royal navy is doing by making the apache fully sea capable.</div>

M113 is an ARMOURED personel carrier also... its well known that it can only withstand small-arms fire... up to 7.62mm...<br><br>with ships, i agree with u... u're better off making them smaller, stealthier and faster and armed with more missiles on each one...</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Heavier armour might be good for Tanks... I dunno<br>But heavier armour for ships is useless... A missile doesn't need to hit a ship to make her sink... With a missile just scrap pass the upperdeck is enough to cause considerable damage, like in Faklands War... Like how HMS Sheffield goes to her graveyard... And no matter how heavier your armour is with the velocity (at least Mach 0.<img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"> of the most missile which is traveling it can pierce through it easily... Once it pierce through the ship's hull, even it doesn't detonate, it will cause great damage and needs a hell lotsa and tough damage control and will cripple the ship...<br><br>thus how thick does the hull needs to be just needs to satisfy the ship's requirement to tolerate against the level of sea state it wants and displacement...<br><br>the best protection against incoming missile, i think it's still ECM and ECCM...<br>Anti Missile Missile or CIWS is also a good help</div>
