            <div class='col-md body'>SIMBEX 2006<br>[url=http://indiannavy.nic.in/pres01.htm]SIMBEX 2006[/URL]<br><br>The thirteenth maritime bilateral exercise between the Indian and Singapore navies (or SIMBEX in short), is being conducted from 26 Feb to 08 Mar 06. SIMBEX, which is an institutionalised exercise between the two navies on an annual basis, being held for the first time off the eastern seaboard of India. Majority of the previous interactions have taken place off Kochi in southwest India though the last one, held in March 2005, was also for the first time in South China Sea.<br><br>Two Victory class missile corvettes, one Fearless class ASW patrol vessel and one Fokker 50 maritime patrol aircraft will be participating in SIMBEX 2006 from the RSN. The Indian Naval participation in the exercise will include one destroyer, two missile corvettes, one submarine and maritime patrol aircraft. The exercise will see both navies interacting with each other at sea as well as in the harbour. Whilst the harbour phase would focus on exchanging operational experiences through professional interaction, the sea phase would concentrate upon joint conduct of a plethora of exercises ranging from surface firings, anti-air engagements to anti-submarine warfare and maritime patrol aircraft operations.<br><br>Indian NavyÂ’s operational interaction with the RSN, which commenced with training exercises in 1994 has seen a quantum leap since then. Indian Navy lays great stress on enhancing bilateral ties, improving mutual understanding and developing interoperability with regional navies through exercises such as SIMBEX. These exercises not only provide immense training value to our sea going personnel but also help in fostering mutual trust and friendship between two nations, adding strength to our commitment and resolve to tackle common challenges of maritime environment in the present scenario.</div>
