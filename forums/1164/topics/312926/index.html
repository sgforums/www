              <p>I see lionnoisy is back at it again, after keeping quiet for a while following his staggering defeats.</p>
              <p>For one thing, he seems to think that this "mini CV" is going to be used in the same was as a Nimitiz class carrier, but once again had he bothered to do his homework and even read from the article he quoted, he would have realized that is is an entirely different class of ship more like the USMC USS Wasp then a CV.</p>
              <p>In fact the term LHD should speak for itself, but he seems to have lost it and suggests that it is for the Superbugs <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Cartoon/teeth.png" alt="teeth.png"><img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Cartoon/teeth.png" alt="teeth.png"><img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Cartoon/teeth.png" alt="teeth.png"> </p>

              A fourth sailor is still missing, after a collision between a patrol boat and a container ship late on Friday.</p>
              <p>The four, all women, are believed to have been asleep in their quarters at the rear of the navy vessel, which was crushed in the collision with the Dutch-registered freighter in the Singapore Strait.</p>
              <p>As investigations continue into the cause of the accident, salvage workers have begun an operation near the site of the incident to recover a large metallic object, believed to be part of the patrol boat's stern that was wrenched off by the impact.</p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">The bodies of 1st Sergeant Seah Ai Leng, 25, Sergeant Heng Sock Ling, 24, and Corporal Goh Hui Leng, 22, were found over the weekend.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">Divers found the body of Goh Hui Leng lodged between the bunks on the vessel, and the bodies of the other two women were washed up on the Indonesian resort of Bintan, south-east of Singapore.</span></p>
              <p><strong>Hopes fade</strong></p>
              <p>Officials said they held little hope of finding the fourth sailor, 2nd Sergeant Chua Bee Lin, alive.</p>
              <p>The women's ship, the RSS Courageous, a 500-ton Singaporean anti-submarine patrol boat, was towed to Singapore's Changi Naval Base on Saturday.</p>
              <p>The cargo ship, the ANL Indonesia, which was en route to South Korea, sustained only minor damage and has been anchored in Singapore pending an investigation.</p>
              <p>"The collision was the most terrible accident," Deputy Prime Minister and Defence Minister Tony Tan said after inspecting the damaged ship.</p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">"In terms of the possible loss of life, this is the largest loss of life from a single accident that the RSN (Republic of Singapore Navy) has encountered so far," he said.</span></p>
              <p>The accident happened minutes before midnight on Friday, about one nautical mile (1.8 kilometres) north of Pedra Branca, an islet claimed by both Singapore and Malaysia.</p>
              <p>Pedra Branca lies off peninsular Malaysia's southern coast, strategically situated at the eastern entrance of the Singapore Strait.</p>
              <p>Eight of the 44 crew on the Courageous were injured. There were no injuries on the ANL Indonesia.</p>

              <p>Mr noisy lion:</p>
              <p>I might have missed it, but where does it say in any of your sources that these CVs are gonna be used for the Super Hornets? For example, that blog article you gave stated:</p>
              <p><em>'Using their integrated helicopters and watercraft, each vessel will be
                  able to land approximately 1,000 personnel, along with their vehicles,
                  the new Abrams tanks, artillery and supplies.'</em></p>
              <p>Uhh.... helicopters, yes, but where does it say anything about airplanes? Or are you gonna say that the Superbugs fall into the category of 'their vehicles' in the above quote?</p>
              <p>What are you gonna claim next - that all the crewmen in the ships will be wearing Rollerblades?</p>

              <p>I cannot imagine a superhornet ladened with A2G munitions and fuel tanks taking off from that deck.  The Yanks had to use catapults to Shoot theirs off the deck. The Ski Jump will only serve to slow the jet down prematurely, resulting in a low and slow jet at extremely low altitudes. </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Landing is totally out of the question.  Maybe we are looking at JSFs?</p>

              <p>Everybody can see the ski ramp on board, but they are smart enough to know it's not for Superbug use.</p>
              <p>Man you really are that ignorant are you not?</p>
              <p>You enlarge also no use, you simply do not understand how things work at all.</p>
              <p>Ski jump or not, there is no way for the Superbug, or most non STOL combat planes for that matter, to reach their takeoff speed in that short a distance on an LHD. The Ski jump is to enable a better AOA when you clear the ship, but it had no effect on your takeoff speed... if you are too slow you'll simply stall the moment you leave the Ski jump and crash into the sea. Unfortunately the LHD (or any ship for that matter) lacks the required length for the Superbug (or any non STOL for that matter) to reach a viable speed to take off, Ski jump or not.</p>
              <p>What is required is a catapult, which of course this ship does not have.</p>
              <p>And of course landing is another issue without an angled deck, it means that it cannot retrieve aircraft without having to do a full deck turnover because to do an aborted landing would mean having the plane smack straight into whatever's parked in the way on the deck. So much for tactical flexibility.</p>
              <p>All this of course, is no surprise because the LHD was NEVER intended to launch non STOL aircraft.</p>
              <p>LOL, lionnoisy's notion of launching Superbugs from LHDs is prehaps akin to us launching recon bikes from within our Bionixes... or having Abrams tanks airdropped from C-130s <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Cartoon/teeth.png" alt="teeth.png"><img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Cartoon/teeth.png" alt="teeth.png"><img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Cartoon/teeth.png" alt="teeth.png"> </p>
              <p>Fixed wing aircraft that would operate from the LHD would be STOL/VTOL examples such as the Harrier, or the JSF, but NOT the Superbug.</p>
              <p>What's next? lionnoisy is going to say the aussies are going to retrofit their superbugs to be VTOL aircraft? <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Cartoon/teeth.png" alt="teeth.png"><img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Cartoon/teeth.png" alt="teeth.png"></p>
              <p>Seriously lionnoisy, if we had people like you giving advice to our military, the SAF is totally doomed.</p>

              <p>3) Run for your life combat position- SAF soldiers must be trained to hold the SAR in one hand by the handle, leaving themselves defenceless and RUN FOR THEIR LIVES!</p>
              <p>4) 30 megaton UAF- Alleged Mandai Underground Ammo Facility is equal to Cheyenne Mountain, and that it's 250 ton blast rating matches up to Cheyenne Mountain's 30 MEGATON protected rating.</p>
              <p>5) Poor man's CV- Launch and recover non STOL aircraft from small, non catapult capable, LHD instead of using a proper CV.</p>

              <p>The DUH factor here is astounding.  Australia's waiting for the JSF, and ski ramps a la HMS Invincible have long been established for STOL aircraft.  Noisy Pussy's fucked it up once again - as if that's any surprise.</p>

              ratio was for earliest version of harrier]</p>

              <p>the LHD is fitted with a ski jump, supposed for the use
              of F-18, which has a thrust to weight ratio of &gt;0.95, lets
              assume 1. if im not wrong, super bug also heavier than harrier (by
              10,000 lbs)</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>both have ruffly similar wing loadings, (arnd 93lb
              liddat)</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>lets contemplate, </p>
              <p>&gt;due to lower thrust to weight ratio, super bug shld have
              lower acceleration rite?</p>

              <p>It
              wants a third 26,000 tonne amphibious ship equipped with vertical
              take-off jet fighters, a fourth $2billion air warfare destroyer and
              submarine-launched cruise missiles that are able striketargets

              <p>It also coincides with a push by the Rudd Government to save
              $1billion a year in defence costs as it ordered a new White Paper to

              <p>Lion noisy, u just screwed yourself there.</p>
              <p>The RAN wants a 26,000 tonne amphibious ship to equip with V/STOL jets.  Not Superbugs. </p>
              <p>No superbug has landed or taken off from an LHD of this class, and its likely that they will ever. </p>
              <p>Su-27/33s operate off the Admiral Kutsenov's ski-jump based on 2 qualities.  It has a longer ski-jump to allow the Sukhois to pick up more airspeed, and the Sukhoi itself has a huge thrust to weight ratio (Russian Brute force engines) to do so.</p>
              <p>The Superbug is no flanker in terms of that kinda performance.  But I'd like front row seats if a Superbug does try to do a ski-jump take off.  Failure or not, its gonna be a hell of a show.</p>
