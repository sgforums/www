              <p><br>It would behoove you not to pay heed to the "possiblility" of his ideas, because they are almost always mutally exclusive from the feasibility of them.</p>
              <p>Such as running for his life by rendering himself defenceless carrying his rifle by the SAR scope, fitting grunts with inline skates, crashing UAVs and launching non- STOVL from LHDs... all these can be possibly done but the soundness of such plans leave more questions to be answered on the general ability of their suggestor to use common sense.</p>
              <p>Pretty much lionnoisy is the kind of person who climbs a tree with his underwear on his head- ie. a person who is trying to find new ways to do things without really making any direction into finding a better way of doing things- or worse, even making things worse then they were before...</p>
              <p>I like his point on the SAR-21... in his desperate attempt to beat out any more advanced designs he insisted that grunts have to use the scope handle while "running for their lives" when it would not only leave them defenceless but is actually one of the least efficent ways to carry a rifle and run! So his "ideas" actually makes things worse!</p>

              <p>His ideal may be weird ... and unsound but we still can give it benefit of doubt and further analyst it, if there is a chance of it may work , we still have to acknowledge it - althought it is unsound, uneconomical and not practical !</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I would say launching non- STOVL from LHDs is unsound under normal warfare... but we still can discuss over it , as there is desperate time when people may do it ... !!!</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Take the <strong>Doolittle Raid</strong>, <a title="April 18" href="/wiki/April_18"><span style="color: #0000ff;">18 April</span></a> <a title="1942" href="/wiki/1942"><span style="color: #0000ff;">1942</span></a>,  is classical example of it .... people all say b-25 is too heavy, too short runway - they too just try it on the airfield only...never on a real aircraft carrier ... that how they did the testing and training too ... Of course at that time people say no wanker in his right minds will do it ...   but in the end it was done....... althought - as we know it was a unsound mission - as the payload drop is small and did little damages, but it did wonder for the moral !</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>With all the facts, i think LHD is not designed for normal F-18 operations ...  it will never be able to handle normal rountine f-18 operations..... thus lionnoisy is definitely way off in his thinking that Aust can operate f-18 on LHD...!!</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>But if you want to consider a one-time type of extreme mission one-way ticket like Doolittle operations ... with f-18 &amp; LHD + skip-ramp.... actually it may just be possible.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>from the dolittle raid as example ... and the testing... i think launching with mininal fuel and weapon - for a f-18 from a lHD using the full length is actually possible ..... as for landing .... with nets ...... well it is possible .... but it may cause damage to the f-18. But considering the fact that f-18 with the launching without extra fuel tanks, the time to setup net to land each f-18 ... well i don't think any f-18 will be landing any time soon on LHD ... as they would have run out of fuel on mission and just waiting to land !!! It will be a one way ticket !!!</p>

              <p>Yeah.... seriously speaking, historians and strategists generally agree that the Doolittle Raid didn't have any strategic value at all. It was simply Roosevelt's way of sending the Japs a strong message: 'You pissed us off, and this is just a sign of things to come'.</p>
              <p>The raid didn't really cause a lot of damage either..... the story goes that the Swiss ambassador was lunching with the US ambassador in Tokyo (who had yet to be recalled) and when the bombs went off, they thought it was an airshow.</p>
              <p>Otherwise, virtually all the B-25s crashed in China later on, and it did Tokyo little damage.</p>
              <p>So really, while it MIGHT be technically to place a couple of Superbugs on these vessels, there's absolutely no real reason for wanting to do so unless the Aussies are desperate enough to kamikaze a couple of them into enemy shipping.</p>
              <p>Just like in-line skating troops.... no one said that we CAN'T make our troops wear them.... it's just so stupid that no one will ever seriously consider that idea. <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Cartoon/teeth.png" alt="teeth.png"></p>

              <p>Do you know that in the Russian carriers, although they operate fixed wing conventional a/c, it cannot take off with full bomb load... as they use ski jump and not catapults.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Therefore they are more A/A rather then A/G platforms as their bombload and external fuel payload is limited.</p>

              <p> </p>
              <p>The Aussie are on the F-35 platform. They are problem thinking of the S/VTOL version of the F-35.... to operate on their new LHD.......</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>As for flying Hornets off USN CVs, it might be to gain some experience operating fixed wing but they might not actually operate Hornets off their new platforms.</p>

              <p>Which is kinda ironic since the idea was to be able to strap more payload onto them.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Still, a worthy note is that the Superbug has 1:1 Tw ration @ full tank with Afterburners.  Strap anything more to it, and it becomes the slow bug.</p>
              <p>Minimum take off distance for a superbug is abt 1550 ft according to some S'bug drivers. The Canberra LHD he showed was about 800ft from stern to bow, tops.  Even if it were to run 30-40 knots into the wind, we'd still be short of a few hundred feet.  Throw in a ski-jump, maybe we might be able to get an unarmed and half-fueled superbug airborne by utilising the entire deck length.</p>
              <p>It may not be impossible, but sure sounds impractical.</p>

              <p>Thisis just silly to talk about F-18 flying off from the LHD. It has never been considered like that by the ADF.</p>
              <p>Some noisy lion is dreaming up stuff. RAN simply need to replace the current 2 LST it has. They have opted for the LHD so that they can feery attack helos (Tigers) as well as the new NH-90 transport choppers at the same time as bring in the troops. Furthermore, the reason they have gone flattop in terms of transport ship is that so that more helos can take off at the same time. This is important in an "assult" siutation like what happened in East Timor many years ago.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Of cours, there is always the options to consider getting some F-35B if and when available.  But this will only be like and air-force detactment. The F-35s will never been owned by RAN .</p>
