              pick up more airspeed, and the Sukhoi itself has a huge thrust to

              <p><br>Not OK.  You admit to having no information linking Superbugs to ski ramps but you carry on like a two-bob watch about this numbskulled idea.  Then you turn around and demand news about the first two LHDs being for V/STOLs. I said it before, I'll say it again - <span style="color: #ff0000;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><em><strong>HYPOCRITE</strong></em></span></span>.</p>

              <p>You are truly being a classic lionnoisy, taking up figures and numbers and tossing them to us as if we do not know what we are talking about. Do you realize your lame attempts to defend your point only serve to worsen your situtation?</p>
              <p>Both a construction crane and an M1 Abrams tank can weight 70 tons, but are they capable of doing the same thing?</p>
              <p>Both a NATO 7.62mm and a AK 7.62mm have the same bullet diameter, but are they of the same power?</p>
              <p>Firstly an LHD is NOT a mini CV, it's mission profile is quite different.</p>
              <p>And secondly, you are forgetting this very important thing called that catapult, which the LHD does not have. The Nimitz uses catapults to fling their aircraft into the air in the limited deck space they have to launch aircraft:</p>

U.S. Navy tactical aircraft use catapults to launch with a heavier warload than would otherwise be possible.

              <p>While the tender released for the <em>Canberra</em> class did not specify that the ships needed to be capable of operating <a title="STOVL" href="/wiki/STOVL"><span style="color: #0066cc;">STOVL</span></a> fixed wing aircraft,<sup id="cite_ref-6" class="reference"><a href="/forums/1164/topics/#cite_note-6"><span style="color: #0066cc;">[7]</span></a></sup> it has been proposed that such a capacity be included in the final design. In 2004 a review by the <a title="Parliament of Australia" href="/wiki/Parliament_of_Australia"><span style="color: #0066cc;">Australian Parliament's</span></a> Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade recommended that the Australian government should consider purchasing a small number of <a title="F-35 Lightning II" href="/wiki/F-35_Lightning_II"><span style="color: #0066cc;">F-35B Lightning II‎</span></a> for the <a title="Fleet Air Arm (RAN)" href="/wiki/Fleet_Air_Arm_%28RAN%29"><span style="color: #0066cc;">Fleet Air Arm</span></a> to operate from the <em>Canberra</em> class ships.<sup id="cite_ref-7" class="reference"><a href="/forums/1164/topics/#cite_note-7"><span style="color: #0066cc;">[8]</span></a></sup> In March 2008 the RAN was reported to have requested that the government purchase a third <em>Canberra</em> class ship and VTOL aircraft.

              <p>The Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade's recommendation was made on the grounds that STOVL aircraft would provide deployed Australian forces with air defence and close air support. Despite the slight reduction in range and payload of STOVL F-35B compared to <a title="CTOL" href="/wiki/CTOL"><span style="color: #0066cc;">CTOL</span></a> F-35A (and C) aircraft, they are inherently flexible in terms of operation, and can provide organic close air support right at the edge of the Field of Battle Area, which land based aircraft cannot do. An order of F-35Bs for the Canberra-class could form part of the planned order of up to 100 F-35s for the <a title="Royal Australian Air Force" href="/wiki/Royal_Australian_Air_Force"><span style="color: #0066cc;">Royal Australian Air Force</span></a>. The Navantia design has a <a class="mw-redirect" title="Ski-jump" href="/wiki/Ski-jump"><span style="color: #0066cc;">ski-jump</span></a> included in its initial design, and is designed to operate and sustain a mixed jet and helicopter carrier air group of up to 36 aircraft for the Spanish Navy.</p>

              <p>Where in all this do you see anything about superbugs being launched from LHDs?</p>
              <p>But there is plenty of information about the use of STOVLs in this class of ship, which is no surprise to anybody who knows his stuff well... as Gedanken said the DUHZ factor here is astounding, but yet you somehow manage to screw this up.</p>

              <p>I like his point on the SAR-21... in his desperate attempt to beat out any more advanced designs he insisted that grunts have to use the scope handle while "running for their lives" when it would not only leave them defenceless but is actually one of the least efficent ways to carry a rifle and run!

              seems like a bit of a leap given India’s needs on multiple fronts.<strong> The
              F/A-18 and Rafale also require full catapult launch facilities if used

              <p>The US Navy conducted those STOVL tests together with the F-14A, F/A-18A, and TC-2. I do not know of any tests conducted on the Larger &amp; Slower to Acclerate Superbug.  Care to share with us any links or evidence to that test?</p>

              <p>Basically, the ski-jump consists of a curved inclined ramp installed in the<br>bows of the carrier. An aircraft traversing the ski-jump follows its curved profile,<br>and on exit, is launched into an upward ballistic trajectory. Compared to a flat<br>deck exit, this trajectory (for the same take-off run) can place the aircraft 200-300<br>feet higher in the air and, thus, provide it more height (and time) to accelerate<br>into forward flight. However, because of the short take-off run available on a<br>ship’s deck, an aircraft would normally exit from the ski-jump at a very low<br>speed. Should this speed be below the stalling speed of the aircraft (as it is for the<br>Harrier), the flying controls remain ineffective, and the aircraft will, in layman’s<br>terms, “fall out of the sky.”</p>

              <p><br>In this respect, V/STOL aircraft have an advantage, because at low speeds,</p>
              <p>they rely not on aerodynamic controls (which require high relative air flow over</p>
              <p>the aerodynamic surfaces), but on jet reaction controls. These controls, called<br>“puffers,” use hot air, bled from the engine, and allow the machine to be con-<br>trolled in all planes till it accelerates into an aerodynamically safe flying regime.<br>It was for this reason that use of the ski-jump could not be contemplated for<br>CTOL aircraft, under normal circumstances.</p>

              <p>It seems that everybody agrees that Superbugs can only take off from CTOL decks.</p>
