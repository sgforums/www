Those that I can remember are CPR, signal set assembly, GPS, river crossing, range and SAR21 stripping and assembly. Two more can't remember. It's held at Tekong and conducted by SISPEC. Typically begins at 2130hrs and ends around 0700hrs the next day.<br><br>COL Toh did it twice, btw. The first was to qualify for the badge and the second time was to accompany COA. Garang.</div>

One of them is even a masters, I believe. Until recently, he was holding four concurrent portfolios: Comd 9 Div, Chief Infantry Officer, Director of NS Affairs and President of Chevrons (Specialist and Warrant Officers' Club). He recently relinquished his DNSA position to Comd 6 Div. So you can see, he's a very busy man. Should be getting his star this June.</div>

Tis is coz due to OCS training being shortened to 9mths from the current 10mths. Guess tis has sth to do wif NS being reduced to 2yrs. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cry.gif" alt="Crying or Very sad" title="Crying or Very sad"><br><br>On a sidenote, it seems harder to be selected to be an officer nowadays. Observed that in certain coys in Jan 05 BMT, sometimes only 1 per platoon is selected to go OCS, perhaps MINDEF has finally woken up their idea n is introducing more quality control for officers?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz"><br></div>

Cavlary troops would qualify with a weapon while mounted or dismounted.  Thus, their bars were marked as "CARBINE-M" or "PISTOL-D".
