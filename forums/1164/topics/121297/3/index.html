Therefore, these badges would have a bar hung under the badge the identified the weapon.   Each bar was embossed with "RIFLE", "GRENADE", "BAYONET", etc.  There were many different types of weapons.  Cavlary troops would qualify with a weapon while mounted or dismounted.  Thus, their bars were marked as "CARBINE-M" or "PISTOL-D".  It was not unusual to see a soldier wearing 4, 5 or 6 bars hanging from his Sharpshooter Badge.

            <div class='col-md body'>The Combat Infantryman Badge was approved by the Secretary of War on 7 October 1943 and announced in War Department Circular 269 dated 27 October 1943. On 8 February 1952, the Chief of Staff, Army, approved a proposal to <span style="color: red;">add stars to the Combat Infantryman Badge to indicate award of the badge in separate wars.</span> Under this change in policy, the badge was no longer limited to a one-time award, but could now be awarded to eligible individuals for each war in which they participated. Awarded to personnel in the grade of Colonel or below with an infantry or special forces military occupational specialty who have satisfactorily performed duty while assigned as a member of an infantry/special forces unit, brigade or smaller size, during any period subsequent to 6 December 1941 when the unit was engaged in active ground combat. The policy was expanded to permit award to Command Sergeants Major of infantry battalions or brigades, effective 1 December 1967.<br><br><img src="http://www.usmedals.com/prodpix160/b210.jpg"><br><br><img src="http://www.usmedals.com/prodpix160/b211.jpg"></div>
