LOUIS, June 19, 2003 Â– Called Â“the toughest combat aircraft in the worldÂ” the Boeing [NYSE: BA] AH-64D Apache Longbow multi-role combat helicopter has a newly designed main rotor blade fold system which adds flexibility to the U.S. ArmyÂ’s deployment planning for force insertion.<br><br>In April the U.S. Army demonstrated that Apaches could be deployed from Fort Hood, Texas, to the Middle East is as little as 66 hours Â–the time from notification to operation in the field.<br><br>In November 2002, the Army asked Boeing to develop a system that would substantially reduce the time it takes to reassemble and have Apaches ready to fly after they roll off a transport. The blade fold system, produced by Boeing in Mesa, Ariz., speeds deployment of the Apaches shipped by cargo aircraft.<br><br>The new blade fold system allows the main rotor blades to be folded along the aircraftÂ’s length without being removed. The solution also provides for storage of the Apache LongbowÂ’s radar dome on the aircraft aft of the rotor hub for transport.<br><br>The first 24 units were designed, developed and delivered in March, four months after the initial request and ahead of schedule. Â“It took just 120 days to bring this program from idea to delivery,Â” said John Pennypacker, Boeing Blade Fold Project lead. Â“A total of 48 units were delivered by mid April with the last six units delivered one month early. It is a truly amazing accomplishment.Â”<br><br>The blade fold system also saves space. A single C-5 aircraft can carry six Apaches, their flight crews, reassembly technicians and their tools.<br><br>In the past, a second aircraft was needed to haul in special reassembly equipment, and additional personnel. The blades had to be removed and stored along with the radar apart from the aircraft, taking up space in the cargo airplane and requiring more time to reassemble at the ApachesÂ’ destination.<br><br>Â“Not only is the need for a test flight eliminated,Â” continued Pennypacker, Â“but much of the equipment normally needed to lift the blades and radar into place is also eliminated, saving even more space.Â”<br><br>This concept was recently verified at Lackland Air Force Base, San Antonio, Texas, A Boeing team trained and assisted an Army unit in preparing six Apaches, loading &amp; unloading then onto a C-5 transport aircraft, and reassembly and flyaway of the helicopters.<br><br>A unit of The Boeing Company, Integrated Defense Systems is one of the world's largest space and defense businesses. Headquartered in St. Louis, Boeing Integrated Defense Systems is a $25 billion business. It provides systems solutions to its global military, government and commercial customers. It is a leading provider of intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance; the world's largest military aircraft manufacturer; the world's largest satellite manufacturer and a leading provider of space-based communications; the primary systems integrator for U.S. missile defense; NASA's largest contractor; and a global leader in launch services.<br><br><a href="http://www.boeing.com/news/releases/2003/photorelease/q2/pr_030619m.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.boeing.com/news/releases/2003/photorelease/q2/pr_030619m.html</a></div>
