The Korean TKD is probably 3rd grade compared to chinese martial arts.<br><br>But of all the chinese style, the Bruce Lee style of Jit Kuen Do is probably the most effective. It is an amalgamation of many chinese traitional styles. It is the best for street fighting.<br><br>His kicks from somewhere else probably Shaolin. So it is a combination of both northern and southern China styles.]<br><br>U r wrong man.It seems that u dunno much abt understand martial arts or bruce lee.If u go read up about bruce lee.You will know that he actually learned his kicking from a korean tkd master named 'Lee Jungu'.This is also where his famous side kick came from which is not found in any other martial arts.Sidekick is a v special kick which can be found onli in tkd.Chinese wushu kicks does not use the joints but kicks with the knee straight.This proves that tkd is the martial art best with its kicking.Tkd is also battle proven in the vietnam war.<br><br>Also, our singapore army is a conscripted army not like the China PLA regular army.Our soldiers are only serving 2 years for their ns and yet, u expect them to learn very 'chim' martial arts or those that take a long time to master.Some of the soldiers cant even execute a simple punch or front kick.By saying this martial art is better than other martial art is totally pointless.The question is can they master it?Do they have the enough time to to train to make it effective?I can say u nv even put yourself in their shoes before.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Wrong a single art is never good enough.The best art in this world is probaly the brazilian jujitsu style which has always been dominating UFC fights.However this style of combat is only practical in one on one situations.Sure moves like neck crank,rear naked chokes can kill people however it requires time to do it.On a warfront i doubt you will have that amount of free time,so the best way is to teach the soldiers both muay thai kickboxing which is really fast as well as brazilian jujitsu as endorsed by the world reknowned gracie family.That way you can fight both on the ground as well as stand up combat.I am train in this 2 styles and i know how useful it is to have both at your command.</div>

I am acting like a know a lot? No, you are the one acting like you know a lot. I merely offered an opinion. Of course, opinions are very dangerous things here as there are a lot of people like yourself, who has none, and get uncomfortable when other people dare to offer one.<br><br>Let's not argue here, you CBM, PM me.</div>
