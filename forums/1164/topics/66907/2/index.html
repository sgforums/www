            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by V1NS@niTY:</div><div class="quote_body">The Singapore vs Malaysia thing is stale and boring. Just read through all the threads and come with a story, a lot of discussion has been done on this topic.<br><br>I got another idea.<br><br>Sometime in the near future, China has become a major economic and military power. On par or even better then America. It has a huge arsenal of nuclear weapons but it does not want to reveal them( something like iraq ). China then allies itself with Pakistan and North Korea forming a New Asian Axis (NAA). North Korea attacks South Korea and Japan with China's help while India has been severely crippled by a massive surprise nuclear attack by Pakistan. ASEAN responds and forms a war comittee. China decides to expand down to SEA and shutdown US bases in SG.  ASEAN nations decide to defend Vietnam becuz chinese troops have already taken Laos and Burma. China is also engaged with the US pacific fleet and Taiwan.<br>So you can have a jungle war story set in vietnam. Vietnamese, SG, Malaysian, Indo, Thai troops valiantly fending off China's massive armies and airforce. While the navies in the region are busy waging a naval war in the straits. </div></blockquote>Read Richard Herman Jr. He wrote a novel that's almost exactly like your post. And the book is damn cool too. Involves the singapore commandos and there is a wise old chinese man who runs singapore's security and intelligence. The book is called "The last Pheonix"<br>btw, this is my first post <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br></div>
