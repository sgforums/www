" i dont think he would be wanting anything now... he died".<br><br>The singapore PM... barely turning his head and answered... " its expected...nothing surprising about that.... i was wondering how much longer he can cough his lungs out, so... whose in charge now?"<br><br>"He certainly wasnt in the pink of health sir..." came the secretaries reply...and continued "unfortunately... he didnt died of ill health... and the new man in charge is DATO Nanpa."<br><br>" what do you mean.. how did you know he didnt died of ill health??" the PM asked...as 3 letters float into his mind I.S.D. as he wondered... if there is any place in this world... those agents cant put their greasy fingers into.<br><br>" well... according to our spies... it appears that the old man could well be suffocated to death by DATO Nanpa in abdullah's bedroom in a private meeting." came the reply.<br><br>"oh.... now that is certainly a new way to get into power.. but isnt Nanpa a small fry in UMNO?? i do remember abdullah locked the chap up for trying to blow up our water pipe... how did he get into the top seat? where is najib?" asked the PM... half expecting the worst.<br><br>" najib is missing.. we believe he might have been terminated..." came the answer...<br><br>" i see... and the MAF?" asked the PM... knowning the answer well before asking the question.<br><br>" they are behind him... for some reason... we have yet to find out, although we strongly believe not all units are backing him." says the secretary...<br><br>" nonetheless... without najib... the other units would not move against nanpa or his personal army"... as the PM finally took a seat. he continued..." for better or worst... we need to seek a line with this man... we wont interfere in malaysia politics... but we must seek an understanding"<br><br>"i'm afraid he has already called us in advance..."says the secretary... "one of the phone just now was from him" he continued... "and he has makes some demands PM sir"<br><br>The PM looks up and give a wry look on his face and asked.." let me guess... pedra branca? water? railwar? airspace? money? or just simply... asking us to stay out of their squabbles? which one?"<br><br>" none of the above sir..."says the secretary to the surprise of the PM... as he continued" he wants us to open our border.."<br><br>The PM surprised and asked..."wait a minute.. our borders are open... what does he mean??"<br><br>"well... PM sir... he wants us to open our border to permit the arrival of 6 million malaysian chinese that he is expelling from his country!" says the secretary...<br><br>The secretary continues" it appears that he has decreed the confiscation of all properties belonging to chinese and has revoked all malaysian chinese citizenship"<br><br>"the MAF army and police are already out in full force... chasing the chinese from their homes and putting fire to all chinese villages and robbing the chinese blind... to make matters worst... they got millions of malays running amok with them!" says the secretary...<br><br>"they must be MAD!!, there is no way singapore can house more then 10million people overnight!!" shouted the PM as images of his past horros came flashing back to his mind.....he stood a daze while the secretary continues his reports...<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif"

to power.<br><br>afew hours later... he and his top commanders left the party and entered a top secreat MAF base.... there before them on a large table was the map of singapore and johor.<br><br>the map was very detailed down to the last dirt road and around them were satellite photos of singapore... behind their room was another room the size of a football field... filled with monitors, computers and several 80 inch wide flat panel monitors.<br><br>Nanpa looks on happily and finally sat down as his generals took their seats as well....<br><br>Nanpa said" thank you gentlemen for being with me all this time.... for so long, eversince abdullah that half cina babi sat on the seat of PM, we the true sons of the earth, have suffered in silence, today... we have reclaimed what is rightfully ours and soon we will regain the lands we once lost to those cina babis of the south.....my dear generals...for years since abdullah had a stroke, we have planned for this day in earnest... his weakness has made it possible for us to make our moves, we have come far... and we shall not be denied....how is our operation?"<br><br>MAF general LC stands up and begin to present the sitrep.<br><br>" at 2000 hours since your declaration of marshal law... our forces has begun to force all chinese to johor, we expect the move would end in 48 hours with a bit of 'encouragement' from the local mobs"<br><br>" at the same time.. our forces has also begun to converge in johor on the pretext of chasing the chinese hord as well as attempting to 'preserve order' in the transmigration"<br><br>"at this moment... 50 percent of peninsula MAF forces has reached johor... while another 40 percent MAF forces in east malaysia are currently on the sea heading for our eastern ports."<br><br>" we believe that at current speed... all regular forces of MAF would be able to reach johor by 48 hours bringing our forces to 120,000 men"<br><br>" we have also called up large numbers of local militias and past conscripts on the pretext of national crisis to boost our numbers by another 200,000 men."<br><br>" we would have a force of at least 300,000 men in johor in 48 hours"<br><br>"once the singaporeans open their borders... we will push the malaysian chinese into singapore...to clog up all their roads, at the same time drain singapore of its medical, food and water resources."<br><br>"furthermore... we expect the singapore authority to deploy large numbers of troops and police to maintain orders in view of the huge influx of refugees, this would weaken their manpower and dilute their attention."<br><br>" once 4 million chinese have crossed the causeway... we would close our side of the border and move the remaining 2 million malaysian chinese to become the human shield for our MAF forces, this would help nullify the immense firepower of RSAF and SAF arty"<br><br>" if the SAF fire on us and killed the malaysian chinese... there will be tension in singapore as many malaysian chinese who are separated from their families would worry about the possibilities that their love ones might still be in johor as human shield... they would certainly run amok and before long singapore would be paralysed"<br><br>" we believe that as long as we hold the 2 million malaysian chines hostage at all our major base camps and frontlines including beaches and keeps firing rockets, mortars, arty and bullets at singapore indiscriminatly... singapore would soon be forced to surrender.."<br><br>" we also believe that the addition of 4 million malaysian chinese in singapore would quickly but surely... dried up singapore's reservoir and food store... the shortage of water and food would led to tensions that would sure to flare and riots would break out in singapore"<br><br>nanpa was very very happy with the report... and continued " and obviously we aint gonna accept their surrender.... we are gonna let those singaporean and malaysian chinese starve and died killing each other over a glass of water... muahahahhahahaaaa.a....... after that... we come in and clean house of those filthy babis.. muahahahahahaahaa....."<br><br>back in singapore.... the PM has convened a cabinet meeting... and after much discussion... the PM stands up and said " my fellow colleagues... before us.. is a crisis of such magnitude... i fear we may all drown in it before we get to see the sunlight, yet... we cannot leave those poor malaysian chinese who have lost everything overnight to suffer any longer... we must help them. we may not have the means to save everyone of them... but try we will to save as many as we can. therefore... i have decided to open our borders with immediate effect to permit all malaysian chinese refugees into singapore"..<br><br>In MAF underground base... DATO Nanpa who was just briefed on singapore's decision open its borders was full of smile... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_twisted.gif" alt="Twisted Evil" title="Twisted Evil">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_twisted.gif" alt="Twisted Evil" title="Twisted Evil">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_twisted.gif" alt="Twisted Evil" title="Twisted Evil">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_twisted.gif" alt="Twisted Evil" title="Twisted Evil">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_twisted.gif" alt="Twisted Evil" title="Twisted Evil"> . as he speaks silently to himself...

            <div class='col-md body'>The Singapore vs Malaysia thing is stale and boring. Just read through all the threads and come with a story, a lot of discussion has been done on this topic.<br><br>I got another idea.<br><br>Sometime in the near future, China has become a major economic and military power. On par or even better then America. It has a huge arsenal of nuclear weapons but it does not want to reveal them( something like iraq ). China then allies itself with Pakistan and North Korea forming a New Asian Axis (NAA). North Korea attacks South Korea and Japan with China's help while India has been severely crippled by a massive surprise nuclear attack by Pakistan. ASEAN responds and forms a war comittee. China decides to expand down to SEA and shutdown US bases in SG.  ASEAN nations decide to defend Vietnam becuz chinese troops have already taken Laos and Burma. China is also engaged with the US pacific fleet and Taiwan.<br>So you can have a jungle war story set in vietnam. Vietnamese, SG, Malaysian, Indo, Thai troops valiantly fending off China's massive armies and airforce. While the navies in the region are busy waging a naval war in the straits.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I like the tripwire story. But a bit unrealistic. At the most they can only evacuate Johor Chinese. The others will have to stream down from KL and other states. The PM wont be so stupid to let them through. Id rather block off ALL entry to SG... only citizens and PR back in. IF MAF wanna use human shield... the americans are gonna come down fast with security council approval. So lets juz use the human shield as a buffer zone. So what if we cant use our ground forces? Send RSAF and RSN to eradicate all MAF aircraft and vessels. After that, bomb them like siao and make daily night raids on KL. WAit until US come then push our way up north with US forces. If got this type of scenario, thailand sure come into picture, they might attack from the north. And brunei might commit some troops to battle MAF in East malaysia.

Northern States vs the southern ones. A few terror bombs go off in Sg. Of course SG cannot just sit back and let the whole thing destabilize the region.
