Yep the super-cruise is something we need, and its agilie performance which the other 2 fighters cannot match.<br><br>Also it will break trend of us getting US fighters, which will get us better bargains for the F-35.</div>

They are trying to get rid of Europe also... Might be like Sth Korea's case... Just keep your fingers cross... If we get EF2000, it would be wasteful if it is only used for short term as it may be replaced by F-35 in 2012, 5-6 years after usage</div>
