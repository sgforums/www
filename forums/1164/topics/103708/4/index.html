            <div class='col-md body'>have to correct you once again SSK my friend. air brakes are used on landing on practically all aircraft which have them. as in the case of the f16, since they're not mounted on the wings, they can and are used on final approach. for other aircraft, they're used after the wheels contact the runway. in the latter case i believe they're specifically called spoilers. parachutes, like someone mentioned earlier is to shorten landing dist. and...hm...seems that almost all the major fighting aircraft types that have shorter range seem to be equipped with arresting hooks. these are not used for carrier landings but for emergancy landings where arrestor wires would be strung across the runway. can see more when rsaf do the lim chu kang runway excersise. in general, flaps are used on almost aircraft nowadays too. as for the choice of NGF, i really have no opinion. but have heard and read that RSAF has already concluded their technical and capability asessment of the various planes and is currently researching the financial and political viability of the aircraft. soon soon...</div>
