            <div class='col-md body'>Both America and Russians sell diluted version of a particular version of weapons to other countries. This is even so towards those nations very close to them. The Russian are also known to sell "monkey" versions of MBT and BMPs to the other countries and they equipped the satellite states with weaker weapons during USSR era.<br>So my qns is, so does ST sell diluted version of their weapons to other countries? Eg. if lets say country X is interested in the Bionix IFV, will MINDEF allow ST to sell a thinner armour, weaker firepower BX to them? Similarly, ST is working with OTOKAR to market the TERREX IFV to Turkey armed forces. But, MY purchases and is interested in purchasing more equipment from Turkey. Will this compromise our security if one day OTOKAR decides to sell the TERREX to MAF?<br>Another issue is the protection of sensitive info on military equipments. How much info will ST be willing to disclose to the buyer? I mean any foreign country can come forward to ST as a potential buyer, but in fact, they are trying to get info on some sensitive data on eg. BX or Tx..............</div>
