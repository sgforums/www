            <div class='col-md body'>I think that the primary purpose of the MGBs in the first place is to defend coastal regions of Singapore,therefore it will be very suitable for the Coast guards. However it will be a bit of over-kill as the Coast guards don't really need the Harpoon missles. Maybe they will do some modification and upgrading to the boats by removing the missile launchers. They are after all quite old already so will need the make-over. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"></div>

"These are not brand new aircraft but they will be better because of night-flying capabilities."<br><br>The UH-1H is the workhorse of the Philippine military, performing medical and casualty evacuations, troop transport and close air support on operations against a host of Muslim and communist rebel groups.<br><br>The air force already has about 60 UH-1Hs, all acquired from the United States under a foreign military sales programme, but less than 30 are in flying condition.<br><br>Padilla said the funds for the helicopter transfer deal were drawn from the $3 billion military modernisation programme, but that only $90 million was available for disbursement.<br><br>Singapore Technologies Aerospace beat out three other bidders and has agreed to provide maintenance and after-sales service for the helicopters over the next two years.<br><br>"Yes, we did make a bid for the tender," Audrey Tan, a spokeswoman for the defence contractor, told Reuters. "We are still waiting to hear back from the Philippine government."<br><br>Singapore Technologies Aerospace's regional marketing director Anthony Tan said it was still awaiting the final award.<br><br>U.S. HELICOPTERS ALSO COMING<br><br>Padilla said the contract was awarded on December 2 but required a "notice to proceed" from Defence Secretary Eduardo Ermita and General Narciso Abaya, the military's chief of staff.<br><br>"This is a done deal. The president has already given her approval," Padilla said, adding that Singapore had also obtained approval from the United States for the helicopter transfer.<br><br>He said all defence equipment made by U.S. companies need an end-user certificate before being transferred to a third party.<br><br>The Philippines is also getting 10 UH-1Hs from Washington under the U.S. Excess Defence Article programme, but Manila will pay $8 million for their refurbishment.<br><br>The 10 helicopters are in addition to 20 UH-1Hs that U.S. President George W. Bush promised to President Gloria Macapagal Arroyo when she visited Washington in May 2003.<br><br>The 20 helicopters pledged by Bush will be delivered without charge as part of a $300 million military assistance package.<br><br>The Philippines is a close ally in the U.S.-led war on terror, hosting American soldiers to train its own forces. Manila also was a member of the "coalition of the willing" during the Iraq war but did not send any troops. </blockquote></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I initially thought that Singapore bought old Hueys at scrap metal prices from other countries to be first upgraded then resold to the Philippines. Thanks for the article, help cleared my doubts. But there seems to be a problem, we have not have a replacement for the Hueys yet but we already decided to sell them.
