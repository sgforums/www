            <div class='col-md body'>If you look at all the armies of the world today. I think we may be at the crossroads of this early development.<br><br>In the beginning people fought with bare hands, then somebody thought of using stones to kill the enemy better in warfare, once that happened everybody used stones, then slowly they sharpened it or put it on long sticks to get unfair advantage, then when that no longer became an advantage people developed flint, copper and iron swords, spears and ballisticas up to the present day where we have tanks, warplanes and nuclear weapons. What happens if one day everybody has nuclear weapons and chems?<br><br>I think eventually the new edge in warfare will be the use of highly advanced steroids which makes soldiers temporary impervious to fear and pain.<br></div>

How do you maintain that discipline required from soldiers in warfare?<br><br>Imagine before a final charge against an overwhealming enemy position you 'overdose' all the men with heroin or cocaine and they start to turn on each other instead of the enemy.<br><br>Or worse they start to shoot their own commanders</div>
