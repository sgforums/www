            <div class='col-md body'>Well this strategy might not work currently unless Malaysia turns into a S.E.A. Iraq. It is also rather far-fetched. Indonesia and Thailand will not enter into any conflict or their economies will break. Thailand is a peace loving nation and will never go to war. It might go to the extend of trying to stop any Malaysia-Singapore war as the conflict will also hurt its economy. They might also  not allow Singapore a base in southern Thailand to launch attacks. in fact they might oppose the war. Relations between Thailand and Malaysia are so so, not bad i would say. Thus, these factors eliminate the posibility of Thailand joining the war. Indonesia's TNI is weak with all the embargoes and the lack of funds to purchase new equipment and to keep exisiting equipment running. Indonesia will also face massive internal opposition as it would be attacking a fellow muslim nation. Both countries would try their best to prevent themselves from goiing to war. Unless Malaysia becomes land ambitious and claims this territory and that territory that the above two countries occupies.<br>No offence, Airborne Guards.<br></div>
