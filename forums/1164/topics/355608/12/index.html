              <p class="bigtitle">Russia's state arms exporter Rosoboronexport has started contract negotiations on the purchase of a French-built Mistral-class ship, the company's head said on Wednesday.</p>
              <p>"Rosoboronexport has been appointed the implementer of the contract on the purchase of a French Mistral helicopter carrier by the [Russian] Defense Ministry," Anatoly Isaikin told RIA Novosti.</p>
              <p>"We are carrying everything out strictly within the framework of Russia's legal system. This prescribes going through a number of stages which include the assessment of technical parameters and negotiation process involving the Defense Ministry," he went on.</p>
              <p>Isaikin said a number of expert groups had been set up within Rosoboronexport to negotiate the deal with France.</p>
              <p>"All the work on this ship is being carried out in close collaboration with the Defense Ministry. This is a joint effort," he added.</p>
              <p>Russia is negotiating the purchase of at least one French-built Mistral-class ship and plans to build three more vessels of the same class in partnership with the French naval shipbuilder DCNS.</p>
              <p>The Mistral-class ship is capable of transporting and deploying 16 helicopters, four landing barges, up to 70 armored vehicles including 13 battle tanks, and 450 personnel.</p>
              <p>The Russian military has said it plans to use Mistral ships in its Northern and Pacific fleets.</p>

              <p>Interesting article on fixed wing AEW for India</p>
              <p><a href="http://www.aviationweek.com/aw/generic/story.jsp?id=news/awst/2010/06/14/AW_06_14_2010_p48-233219.xml&amp;headline=Indian%20Navy%20Pursues%20Fixed-Wing%20Carrier%20AEW&amp;channel=defense">Link here.</a>
              </p><p> </p>
              <p>Jun 16, 2010</p>
              <p>By Asia-Pacific Staff<br>New Delhi</p>
              <p>The Indian navy is trying to move ahead with an effort to buy four carrier-based fixed airborne early warning and control aircraft, and a request for information is now on the streets.</p>
              <p>The request for information (RFI) calls for aircraft capable of providing “airborne surveillance, detection and tracking of airborne and surface contacts and control.”</p>
              <p>The navy presently operates a fleet of nine Kamov Ka-31 airborne early warning (AEW) helicopters. The comparatively limited range and time-on-station of an AEW helicopter, however, continues to drive the navy’s interest in a fixed-wing early warning platform. The navy has had aspirations to acquire a more capable AEW platform for the better part of a decade, but so far has been unable to secure a procurement program for most of the last 10 years. Some navy officials suggest that the acquisition is still not an immediate priority.</p>
              <p>It is now six years since the navy first approached Northrop Grumman about the E-2C Hawkeye. At the time, the navy was working hard to identify a fixed-wing AEW platform for the Admiral Gorshkov (INS Vikramaditya) aircraft carrier.</p>
              <p>In 2005, the company’s then-director of AEW programs, David Murray, suggested to the Indian navy that E-2C, with appropriate modifications, could be operated from the Gorshkov’s angled deck without a steam catapult, though the navy was not persuaded. Northrop Grumman has since been trying to push the E-2 platform as a shore-based asset, and, in 2009, obtained U.S. government clearance to pitch the E-2D Advanced Hawkeye.</p>
              <p>With one indigenous aircraft carrier in the pipeline—and a second to follow—the navy is convinced it needs a fixed-wing AEW platform, if not for the first, then definitely for the second aircraft carrier.</p>
              <p>Earlier this year, Northrop Grumman officials revealed the company was awaiting guidance from the navy following technical briefings. Company executives have also reportedly been in discussion with the navy about the feasibility of installing a catapult launch system on India’s second indigenous aircraft carrier, a suggestion already under active consideration by naval designers here.</p>
              <p>While the navy has variously weighed the option of considering other longer-range rotary-wing airborne early warning and control (AEW&amp;amp;C) platforms, it has persisted with its view that its fleet of Ka-31s simply will not fulfill its early-warning requirements if it has two aircraft carrier battle groups in the coming decade. Doctrine published three years ago emphasized the need for AEW platforms with meaningful time on station.</p>
              <p>The new RFI states that the aircraft should be capable of providing an integrated air and surface picture of the area under surveillance in adverse weather and in dense electronic environments. Additionally, it should be capable of being used as a command-and-control platform. The navy is stipulating the aircraft also have a limited maritime patrol and search-and-rescue capabilities.</p>
              <p>In a mid-2009 meeting, the navy’s Directorate of Aircraft Acquisition internally discussed the feasibility of the Bell-Boeing V-22 Osprey platform as a potential AEW&amp;amp;C aircraft, but this did not evolve into anything concrete, and any plans to call for information were dropped. At the time, Boeing officials confirmed that they had heard nothing of the Indian navy’s interest in the V-22 platform, and that the company had not initiated any discussions.</p>
              <p>The Indian AEW&amp;amp;C aircraft project, currently under development by the Centre for Airborne Systems (CABS) in Bangalore, will receive its first modified Embraer ERJ 145 later this year. The program has previously been pitched to the navy as a platform for a shore-based early warning aircraft.</p>
              <p>With the first of eight Boeing P-8I long-range maritime reconnaissance aircraft to be delivered in 2013, the navy is also in the market for six medium-range maritime reconnaissance jets. An evaluation program for the latter requirement is expected to begin this year.</p>

Developed from the <a class="redLink" href="/forums/1164/topics/jl1.asp"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0066cc;">JuLang 1</span></span></a> (JL-1) submarine-launched ballistic missile (SLBM), the DF-21 was originally intended for strategic missions but its later variants were designed for both nuclear and conventional missions. The latest DF-21D was said to be the world’s first and only anti-ship ballistic missile (ASBM) system. The DF-21 has also been developed into space launcher and anti-satellite/anti-missile weapon carrier.</p>

              <p>The problem is the IRBM flight profile is similar whether carrying conventional or nuclear warheads.</p>
              <p>As flight durations are often too short to make a determination, this could easily spark a nuclear exchange.</p>
              <p>Even if China were to openly state at point of firing that the IRBMs fired are conventionally armed, could the US accept that risk? Unlikely. The response could well be nuclear.</p>
