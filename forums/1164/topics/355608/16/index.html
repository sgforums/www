              <p><br>Tot the helo pad one is the new sub rescue vessel followed by the 3 endurance above. To the right of the 3 endurance is another endurance followed by the Formidables. Then the sub pen, and the fearless PVs below that with likely 2 earlier LSTs.</p>

              <p>The DDGs should be the Cambelltown and the Chung Hoon. Tico could be shiloh or cowpens.</p>
              <p>Realised the support vessel is quite short (under 120m). Originally tot it could have been the Amelia Earhart which was in Sembawang shipyard earlier but most replenishment vessels are 200+m.</p>

              <p>The "Arleigh Burke DDGs" are actually JDS Sazanami (DD-113) and JDS Samidare (DD-106). Quite different from Burke class. JMSDF ships can be easily identified by the unique helipad paint scheme.</p>
              <p>Correct, the big helipad ship is MV Swift Rescue, commercial vessel chartered by RSN.</p>

              <p>"Based on the feedback from our partners and allies in the Pacific, I think the change in perception by the region will be significant," Adm. Robert Willard told the Senate Armed Services Committee. Willard also noted the "remarkable growth" of China's military.</p>
              <p>But he viewed that impact as largely symbolic, as there would be a long period of training, development and exercises before the carrier becomes operational.</p>

              <h1>Endurance 160 LHD</h1>
              <p>In late 2010 Singaporean naval yard Singapore Technologies Marine (ST Marine) unveiled a new variant of its Endurance-class Landing Platform Dock (LPD). The new Endurance 160 design is a 14,500 ton warship with a full length flight deck. The length overall is 163.7 meters, with the flight deck around 146m long by 25.6m wide with five deck landing spots. The RSN had encountered the Italian Navy's 133-meter long San Giorgio-class LPDs in the Persian Gulf during Operation Blue Orchid 1 and came away impressed with the capabilities packed into the compact hull form.</p>
              <p>Endurance 160 drawings show two deck elevators, one is sited forward on the starboard side and the other amidships close to the aft end of the island superstructure. But deck-edge lifts would allow out-size helos to maneuver into the hangar bay. United States Navy LPHs and the Spanish Navy helicopter carrier (which was derived from Admiral Zumwalt's Sea Control Ship design) have a stern deck elevator which allows rapid movement of helos from hangar to flight deck. The island is a blockhouse with a single mast and funnel and two levels, and a flight control station aft of the island.</p>
              <p>The complement is quoted as 140 personnel, with another 150 for its air wing, with a troop capacity of 400 troops. The warship has a quoted top speed of 22 knots - five knots better than the quoted 17 kts top speed for the smaller Endurance 140. Range is stated to be "more than 7,000 nautical miles" when sailing at 15 kts. Gun armament options on the foc'sle and stern quarter are customer options for placing medium calibre guns and close-in weapon systems (CIWS). The weapon stations do not require deck penetration.</p>
              <p>The design draws heavily upon the Republic of Singapore Navy's (RSN) experience with its four 141-metre long Endurance-class tank landing ships (LST). It is unclear whether the Endurance 160 will offer bow doors, as on the 141-meter long Endurance 140 class. The 22 kts maximum speed of this class may exclude bow doors, which could weaken the forward end of the ship, although the Italian Navy's 133-meter long San Giorgio-class LPDs have bow doors and a 22 knot speed. It is also unclear whether the new Endurance variant would carry floating pontoons, strapped to the side of its hull, used to discharge vehicles and troops during logistics-over-the-shore (LOTS) operations.</p>
              <p>The Endurance 160 is designed to carry two Fast Craft Utility water-jet propelled landing craft and a pair of smaller FCEPs. It is likely that the landing craft complement will include the new drive-through design, which ST Marine designed specifically for LOTS operations involving main battle tanks, which could include but are not limited to Leopard 2-type MBTs. While the Endurance 140 cannot operate hovercraft, since the well dock is not heat-shielded from jet blasts, it remains to be seen whether the enlarged Endurance 160 with the full flight deck will have a protected well dock for hovercraft.</p>
              <p>The Endurance 160 complement of landing craft and naval aviation assets in a small hull creates operational compromises. If the ship is meant to operate close inshore, close to the surf zone of a contested coastline so it can deploy landing craft expediently, the operational advantage of lurking farther offshore and hitting the zone of operations using the embarked air wing is lost.</p>
              <p>The Endurance 160 does not appear to have sufficient hangar space for helicopters to be struck down for all-weather protection. It appears the air wing would be embarked to its area of operations for short duration missions before returning to base. In the case of a peacetime HADR mission, the vehicle deck would presumably not be filled with war material and some space would probably be reserved for helo maintenance</p>

              Over the past week, Reuters reports 2 building in Jiangnan shipyard in addition to the Varyag which was testing its smoke stack last week. Signs of engine testing.
              
              The Varyag can carry 2X J-15 fighters. That can give air forces in the region a pretty big scare (MY has 18 Su-30+8 F-18s, ID has 20+ F16s/Sukhois).

              Reasons to fear China's aircraft carrier 
              
              Last week, China said it had deployed its first aircraft carrier for an inaugural sea trial. Speaking at a Chinese Defence Ministry briefing last month, Colonel Geng Yansheng stressed that the carrier would be used for "research, experiment and training" and would not affect China's defensive naval strategy.
              
              Across the region, however, the deployment has triggered concern. Japan, for example, has asked Beijing to explain the rationale behind the carrier, given that the warship is "highly manoeuvrable and offensive".
              
              As Chinese officials have stressed repeatedly, China has every right to acquire a carrier. Col Geng said that China's long coastline and vast expanse of territorial waters necessitated such a warship.
              
              For many Chinese, the carrier also represents a prestige acquisition. In 1987, General Liu Huaqing, considered by many to be the father of China's modern navy, said: "Without an aircraft carrier, I will die with my eyelids open; the Chinese Navy needs to build an aircraft carrier."
              
              In addition, both foreign and Chinese analysts agree that the carrier - which was acquired from Ukraine in 1998 for US$20 million - will not have any military or operational significance for some time to come.
              
              A full-fledged carrier battle group requires a carrier and an escort force of attack submarines, cruisers and destroyers. Landing fast-moving fighter aircraft on a carrier flight deck is a complicated task that requires years of training.
              
              "China's "starter carrier" is of very limited military utility, and will primarily serve to confer prestige on a rising great power, to help the military master basic procedures, and to project a bit of power," wrote Gabe Collins and Andrew Erickson at China Sign Post, a website that scours first-hand Chinese sources.
              
              That said, concerns about the Shi Lang, as the carrier has been reportedly named after a Qing-era commander who conquered Taiwan, centre on the context of China's carrier development and its current behaviour.
              
              First, the acquisition has been a tad disingenuous. When it was purchased in 1998, Beijing said that the carrier would be a "floating casino". Last week, China's Defence Ministry punted further, stating officially for the first time that it would go on a sea trial - a prelude to an operational deployment.
              
              Second, the acquisition cannot be divorced from regional perceptions about China's recent assertive behaviour over the South China Sea. Already, countries such as Japan, Australia and Vietnam have inched closer to the United States and acquired submarines that could be used to target aircraft carriers. Writing last week, PLA Daily correspondent Guo Jianyue added to the well of suspicion by saying that the carrier could be used to settle territorial disputes.
              
              Third, China has argued that carriers could be used for "soft power" missions such as humanitarian assistance. One cannot disagree with this; the US Navy has used its carriers for humanitarian assistance missions in Indonesia and more recently in Japan. But one cannot run away from the fact that carriers - particularly those with fixed-wing aircraft - are inherently offensive platforms.
              
              Fourth, China's contention that the carrier is part of its defensive strategy should be taken with a pinch of salt.
              
              China has often argued that even offensive moves are consistent with its defensive doctrine. In a paper on China's strategic culture, analyst Andrew Scobell argues that China's military strategy is essentially one of "active defence": While emphasising a defensive strategy, the strategy effectively blurs the distinction between offence and defence.
              
              Thus, China's attack on Vietnam in 1979, and its wars against India and the former Soviet Union in 1962 and 1969 respectively were all labelled 'self-defence counter-attacks' or ziwei fanji.
              
              Lastly, Mr Guo's contention that the carrier could be used to settle territorial disputes represents official thinking, given that the PLA Daily is a state-run paper. Mr Guo argues that the "deterrent of the carrier is usually larger than its practical effectiveness" and that the "political significance of building aircraft carriers is greater than its military significance".
              
              Again, such an argument derives from China's interpretation of traditional Western concepts of deterrence and compellence, which entail the use of coercion to get other countries to bend to one's will. As Mr Guo argues, the carrier could be used in disputes over the South China Sea. But like nuclear weapons, its potency does not derive from its actual use, but the threat of use.
              
              "(The carrier) will start affecting things like South China Sea negotiations, not because of an overt change in military balance, but it will be looming, brooding in the background," Mr Dean Cheng, a senior fellow at the Heritage Foundation, told The Washington Post.
              
              China's carrier does not really change Asia's balance of power for now, says Professor Huang Jing at the Lee Kuan Yew School of Public Policy. But the deployment is the "beginning of a change in the power balance in the Asia-Pacific" that all regional players will have to reckon with in their decision-making, he adds.
              
              In short, there is little reason to fear China's carrier development for now. In the long run, however, what China uses the carrier for will be a source of concern.

              <h1>Endurance 160 LHD</h1>
              <p>In late 2010 Singaporean naval yard Singapore Technologies
              Marine (ST Marine) unveiled a new variant of its Endurance-class
              Landing Platform Dock (LPD). The new Endurance 160 design is a
              14,500 ton warship with a full length flight deck. The length
              overall is 163.7 meters, with the flight deck around 146m long by
              25.6m wide with five deck landing spots. The RSN had encountered
              the Italian Navy's 133-meter long San Giorgio-class LPDs in the
              Persian Gulf during Operation Blue Orchid 1 and came away impressed
              with the capabilities packed into the compact hull form.</p>
              <p>Endurance 160 drawings show two deck elevators, one is sited
              forward on the starboard side and the other amidships close to the
              aft end of the island superstructure. But deck-edge lifts would
              allow out-size helos to maneuver into the hangar bay. United States
              Navy LPHs and the Spanish Navy helicopter carrier (which was
              derived from Admiral Zumwalt's Sea Control Ship design) have a
              stern deck elevator which allows rapid movement of helos from
              hangar to flight deck. The island is a blockhouse with a single
              mast and funnel and two levels, and a flight control station aft of
              the island.</p>
              <p>The complement is quoted as 140 personnel, with another 150 for
              its air wing, with a troop capacity of 400 troops. The warship has
              a quoted top speed of 22 knots - five knots better than the quoted
              17 kts top speed for the smaller Endurance 140. Range is stated to
              be "more than 7,000 nautical miles" when sailing at 15 kts. Gun
              armament options on the foc'sle and stern quarter are customer
              options for placing medium calibre guns and close-in weapon systems
              (CIWS). The weapon stations do not require deck penetration.</p>
              <p>The design draws heavily upon the Republic of Singapore Navy's
              (RSN) experience with its four 141-metre long Endurance-class tank
              landing ships (LST). It is unclear whether the Endurance 160 will
              offer bow doors, as on the 141-meter long Endurance 140 class. The
              22 kts maximum speed of this class may exclude bow doors, which
              could weaken the forward end of the ship, although the Italian
              Navy's 133-meter long San Giorgio-class LPDs have bow doors and a
              22 knot speed. It is also unclear whether the new Endurance variant
              would carry floating pontoons, strapped to the side of its hull,
              used to discharge vehicles and troops during
              logistics-over-the-shore (LOTS) operations.</p>
              <p>The Endurance 160 is designed to carry two Fast Craft Utility
              water-jet propelled landing craft and a pair of smaller FCEPs. It
              is likely that the landing craft complement will include the new
              drive-through design, which ST Marine designed specifically for
              LOTS operations involving main battle tanks, which could include
              but are not limited to Leopard 2-type MBTs. While the Endurance 140
              cannot operate hovercraft, since the well dock is not heat-shielded
              from jet blasts, it remains to be seen whether the enlarged
              Endurance 160 with the full flight deck will have a protected well
              dock for hovercraft.</p>
              <p>The Endurance 160 complement of landing craft and naval aviation
              assets in a small hull creates operational compromises. If the ship
              is meant to operate close inshore, close to the surf zone of a
              contested coastline so it can deploy landing craft expediently, the
              operational advantage of lurking farther offshore and hitting the
              zone of operations using the embarked air wing is lost.</p>
              <p>The Endurance 160 does not appear to have sufficient hangar
              space for helicopters to be struck down for all-weather protection.
              It appears the air wing would be embarked to its area of operations
              for short duration missions before returning to base. In the case
              of a peacetime HADR mission, the vehicle deck would presumably not
              be filled with war material and some space would probably be
              reserved for helo maintenance</p>

              <p>San Giorgio-class LPDs  - which Singapore navy was impress
              with, and influence the design of 160.</p>

              <p>A high possibility that singapore will be replace the
              current  endurance 140 - news of thailand - below is bid to
              sell to chile .  A high chance we soon see endurance
              160 in production.</p>

              <p>Over the past week, Reuters reports 2 building in Jiangnan
              shipyard in addition to the Varyag which was testing its smoke
              stack last week. Signs of engine testing.</p>
              <p>The Varyag can carry 2X J-15 fighters. That can give air forces
              in the region a pretty big scare (MY has 18 Su-30+8 F-18s, ID has
              20+ F16s/Sukhois).</p>
