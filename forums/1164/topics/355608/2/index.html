              <p>Your initial post addressed major issues except for one - is the navy large enough to protect an aircraft carrier?</p>
              <p>IF the RSN is large enough, then I believe over 90% of major surface combatants will be deployed with the carrier - you end up with a CVBG. But 1 CVBG cannot cover all waters around Singapore, many loopholes.</p>
              <p>I don't see any current solution to the problem above.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>On another point, if you have the carrier hit (assuming we use your theory of "1 land airfield for 1 sea airfield"), wouldn't that result in destruction of at least an entire squadron of aircraft?</p>
              <p>I believe a land based staging area for aircraft is much easier to protect than a sea based one.</p>

              <p>While the "floating airbase" - not so much an aircraft carrier - is a great idea that is similar to the makeshift National Day Review Stand built over the waters at the Esplanade, one has to consider that whatever man builds, it can also be easily destroyed.</p>
              <p>With the floating airbase built of concrete - security and safety for the assets from being attacked will have to be considered.</p>
              <p>The development of JDAM deep penetrating high explosive and bunker busting bombs - that "floating airbase" built of concrete will have to have some high grade bomb resistant shelters to store all the air assets that will operate from it.</p>
              <p>Even if these air assets are stored in deep underground shelters and brought to the surface by elevators, these assets will be of little use if the heavy elevator doors remained shut when damaged in any small ways.</p>
              <p>Besides attacks from the air, the "floating airbase" will have to protects it sides and bottom from torpedoes and cruise missiles carrying high explosives - even as the floating platform are built in various compartmentalised frames or forms.</p>
              <p>Total Defense will take on a new meaning in defending a "Floating Airbase".</p>

              <p>i believe its the job of the fighters on the MOB to prevent the MOB from being hammered by bunker buster and watever JDAM or JSOW, anti ship missile or torpedos.</p>
              <p>afterall, the fighters on the carriers are suppose to do that,  and i have no intention of having our fly boys suck thumbs on the MOB while the enemy turn us into a floating target range.</p>
              <p>furthermore, if you have read my post carefully, you would notice that i had proposed a multi-runway AFB combined with a naval base and several army battalions on the single MOB.</p>
              <p>its my belief that the MOB must be big, so big that it could take the hit of a hundred bunker buster without baiting an eyelid.... that's deterrence!</p>
              <p>yes... its not just a MOB, its a freaking monster floating fortress!!</p>

              <p>The following photos are that of an American Entrepreneur who dreamed of selling properties built on an 'unsinkable' floating and cruising, self-contained city - aptly named "Freedom Ship".</p>
              <p>The vessel is 1,317 meters long, 221 meters wide, with an overall height at 104 meters above sea level, and weighs 2.7million metric tons.</p>
              <p>It has a self-contained airport with at least two parallel runways to allow residents and visitors to fly in and out of this floating city.</p>
              <p>Total Passenger Capacity is said to be 50,000 residents and 20,000 visitors, with a crew of 15,000 (that include the operators running and maintaining the ship plus the service personnels manning the various retail and personal services).</p>
              <p>Translate this vision into a hard asset for a floating outpost for the SAF.</p>

                  and their regular take so much money n slp and let ns man do their
                  job. wat make u think ns man( mostly in their early 20sbeing froce
                  to serve) will do a proper job?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>most regular i know sign up because of the paid and the slack
                  life. u sure expansive thing can be trusted on ppl like them??</p>

              <p>Your initial post addressed major issues except for one - is the navy large enough to protect an aircraft carrier?</p>
              <p>IF the RSN is large enough, then I believe over 90% of major surface combatants will be deployed with the carrier - you end up with a CVBG. But 1 CVBG cannot cover all waters around Singapore, many loopholes.</p>
              <p>I don't see any current solution to the problem above.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>On another point, if you have the carrier hit (assuming we use your theory of "1 land airfield for 1 sea airfield"), wouldn't that result in destruction of at least an entire squadron of aircraft?</p>
              <p>I believe a land based staging area for aircraft is much easier to protect than a sea based one.</p>

              <p>Yes, but the fact is that most other CV operators have backups - either another carrier or land bases. Even if their CV is destroyed (forward battle area), they do have defences for their homeland. If Singapore's CV is destroyed, how many planes do we have left?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>And your point of getting rid of airbase land for industrial development; even if it works, there is doubt it can fund another CV <strong>group</strong>, let alone manpower issues.</p>

              <p>It is not a "all or nothing" suggestion. No one expects RSAF to transform from a 100% land based airforce to a 100% CV only airforce.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>As mentioned, RSAF operates 3 main fighter bases each operating 2/3 sqns of aircraft. Reduce 1 air base = 2, maybe 3 sqn to relocate. Why not locate 1 sqn on a CV and distribute the rest to the other 2 remaining base? That's still 6 more remaining if 1 sqn fails which is a lot of backup. With the F-35B, alternative bases such as Sembawang and Seletar can even be considered as well.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>With reference to the CV "battle group", it would be useful to highlight what kind and how many escorts are "must haves" vs "good to haves". Contrast that with the existing capabilities of regional navies to counter such a group. </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The entire spanish fleet operates just 10 frigates and 4 subs with just that 1 carrier of theirs. Does RSN operate fewer vessels? </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Will operating 1 carrier suddenly plunge SG and Mindef into a manpower crisis, I'd hardly think so esp when ships like the Juan Carlos operate with just 243 crew. There are tangible benefits from operating a CV though in terms of deployment, flight training, fleet protection esp in blue water ops eg Gulf of Aden etc.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>PLAB was originally built for passenger jet liners. Is using a base to house aircraft that doesn't need that much runway or facilities really efficient? Redundancy has a price-tag.</p>

              <p>What about a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Helicopter_carriers">helicopter carrier</a>? I feel the utility of a large aircraft carrier is rather, well...slim, but I could make a case for a light aircraft carrier. A small nifty little ship like the British HMS Ocean or the Yank Wasp-class ships could allow us to base existing helicopter assets off of it. It'd just be an amphibious assault ship, basically, like an expanded LST. Forgive me for the lecture :D</p>
              <p>The plus points would be: one, we can use existing rotary-wing aircraft (plus our SH-60 Seahawks when they arrive).</p>
              <p>Two, being able to deploy more helicopters at sea would help us in some areas: anti-submarine warfare, humanitarian support, containing threats from small boats and the like.</p>
              <p>Three, it could support amphibious operations.</p>
              <p>Four, if our armed forces feel creative, they could base UAVs and VTOL/STOVL aircraft off of the deck. I mean, it has a flat top.</p>
              <p>Of course, there are the problems of cost, logistics, politics and feasibility that have been covered above by everyone else. </p>
              <p>I like the TS's arguments. Good that he introduced this topic :) Personally, though, I think that a fixed-wing capable aircraft carrier would be of limited utiity in wartime. The liabilities of protecting and paying and politically defending and manning it could well outweigh the benefits of getting an alternate airfield and (the marginal) forward deployability. I'm a pessimist, really.</p>
              <p>Then again, I'm talking off the top of my head, as we all are. It'd be nice if someone like the DSTA or the Navy staff took the topic up and crunched some numbers. Wonder if they surf SGForums? :)</p>
              <p>Oh yeah, here's some info about the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chakri_Nareubet">Chakri Nareubet</a>, Thailand's aircraft carrier.</p>
              <p> EDIT: oops, looks like this has been touched on before in an earlier post. In any case, I hope I add to the debate :P</p>

              <p>the TS's purpose is to explore the viability of a F35B-light carrier concept in the very long run when maintaining land-based airbases might be unfeasible in land scarce singapore.</p>
              <p>not to lobby or make policy recommendations i think. im sure any adequately qualified procurement/policy maker would have half a brain and wouldnt even consider threads or forum postings some form of legitimitazation or political currency to spend, nor even factor it into their decision making process.</p>
              <p>It'd be nice if we got realistic. if we do get a light carrier, with no little to no coastline to defend, how do we justify such a carrier in the short to medium term ? just look at the HYUGA class of the JMSDF as a case in point. one "helicopter destroyer" and all that political controversy.</p>
              <p>your points are unrealistic to begin with</p>
              <p>1) its either a complement of fixed, or rotary wing or a complement of both. but numbers are finite. deck space is premium space. having F35Bs or STOVL aircraft operating will take up precious top deck space the helos need to land on and hangar space. i.e its probably more efficient to have something like 12 helos or 8 F35Bs rather than 6 helos and 3 F35Bs. you cant cut it either way unless you want to upsize the ship. and it wouldnt really fit into a light carrier definition after that.</p>
              <p>STOVL aircraft are likely to have a higher munitions and fuel load, that will entail significantly more capacity and if built to mil-spec steel, significant cost increases, not to mention the air-wing maintainence and crew.</p>
              <p>2) sure, under what sea state conditions can helicopters be effectively deployed, recovered and operated? do we have several thousand miles of EEZ to patrol and protect or do we have a 2000NM coastline ? already, what we have for our waters is overkill.</p>
              <p>an oft overabused statistic is that singapore's "amphibuous capacity" is one of the highest in the world if compared to a ship to population ratio.</p>
              <p>3) what amphibuous missions are we talking about ? what redland is there to fight ? how are your SAF troops going to mount an amphibuous assault without being within range of MLRS fire ?</p>
              <p>if the carrier / whatever exists at that point, is to stay safe, it has to be out of MLRS range at the minimum. that may need OTH force projection capability. with the number of helos currently avaliable, can we do that ? can we upkeep a logistics chain from that distance ? are there enough landing craft to operate from a ship to shore at that kinda distance after accounting for attrition and equipment failure ? do we currently have any amphibuous armor assets that could support a ship-to-shore assault ?</p>
              <p>unlikely SAF can ever develop a full and proper expeditionary capacity. limited amphibuous support yes. amphibuous warfare/ MEU style invasion against enemy held territory, unlikely.</p>
              <p><br>4) still space constraints. UAV crew = strain on shipboard bandwith/communication requirements. the same problem as mentioned in 1) still remains. its a tradeoff. u can either have X quantity of UAV or Y quantity of F35Bs but only X-5 UAVs + Y-4 F35Bs if you use them together.</p>
              <p>dont look at the chakri naubet. its a bad example to look at as she rarely leaves port (or so from what ive read). the HYUGA class will be interesting to observe how she complements the KONGO class AEGIS cruisers and joint JMSDF-US 7th fleet (PACCOM) exercises</p>

              <p>It is not a "all or nothing" suggestion. No one expects RSAF
              to transform from a 100% land based airforce to a 100% CV
              only airforce.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>As mentioned, RSAF operates 3 main fighter bases each operating
              2/3 sqns of aircraft. Reduce 1 air base = 2, maybe 3 sqn
              to relocate. Why not locate 1 sqn on a CV and distribute the
              rest to the other 2 remaining base? That's still 6 more remaining
              if 1 sqn fails which is a lot of backup. With the F-35B,
              alternative bases such as Sembawang and Seletar can even be
              considered as well.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>With reference to the CV "battle group", it would be useful to
              highlight what kind and how many escorts are "must haves" vs "good
              to haves". Contrast that with the existing capabilities of regional
              navies to counter such a group. </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The entire spanish fleet operates just 10 frigates and 4
              subs with just that 1 carrier of theirs. Does RSN
              operate fewer vessels? </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Will operating 1 carrier suddenly plunge SG and Mindef into
              a manpower crisis, I'd hardly think so esp when ships like the Juan
              Carlos operate with just 243 crew. There are tangible benefits
              from operating a CV though in terms of deployment, flight
              training, fleet protection esp in blue water ops eg Gulf of Aden
              etc.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>PLAB was originally built for passenger jet liners. Is
              using a base to house aircraft that doesn't need that
              much runway or facilities really efficient? Redundancy
              has a price-tag.</p>

              <p>Slim, the number of aircraft sqn you are projecting has some errors.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Example: Changi Airbase (East &amp; West) has 3sqns. Only ONE is a fighter Sqn, 145 Sqn (F16D Blk 50/52+). The other 2 (121sqn and 112sqn are the F50 and KC135).</p>
              <p>Paya Lebar - F5s and C130s</p>
              <p>Tengah - F16s and E2Cs</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>It is more like 3-4 fighter/strike sqns left if one is relocated to a CV. (Let's ignore overseas assets for now)</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>With regards to a CVBG - we need ammo support and oil etc. A large ship which can support the CVBG (another ship). Our Formidables; 4? Corvettes<span style="font-family: Tahoma; line-height: normal; font-size: 12px; white-space: pre;"><span style="font-family: arial; font-size: 16px; white-space: normal; line-height: 19px;">; 6? Subs; 2? I think that is quite a chunk of current RSN assets.</span></span></p>
