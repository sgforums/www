              <p>alise, that is exactly what I meant by mixing startup cost and maintanence. You get the money back up front by selling/developing the land, but later it all gets sucked back into maintanence for the carrier.</p>
              <p>From wiki.</p>
              <p>"Each will continue operating at full capacity until that time when they will be decomissioned. This process will first take place on <em>Nimitz</em> and is estimated to cost from US$750 to $900 million. This compares with an estimate of US$53 million for a conventionally powered carrier.</p>
              <p>53 Million just to scrap it later on.</p>

              <p>I can't say for sure ifthe carrier will save money or not, but as a as a politician I wouldn't really care. Ref my old posts,</p>

                                          financial sense. Even if a small carrier takes only 2 squadrons and
                                          we need at least 2 for refit coverage, the cost gets pushed into
                                          the defence budget which is limitless and spread over many years,
                                          and every body gets to redevelop things (air base) and stick a feather in
                                          their cap.</p>
              <p>I almost forgot, if the government wants more money, they better
                                          not redevelop the air base. It's better to do less work and sell at
                                          a high per square foot price, than provide more infrastructure and
                                          lower the land price. Who gives a rat's ass about our creature
                                          comforts anyway.</p>

              <p>For all I know, the carrier may be a net consumer of security and not a provider.</p>

              <p>Actually, the conclusion from the US CVA program was exactly the opposite, a CVE costs almost the same to operate as a CV or CVA, especially the nuclear kind, hence the drive to larger and larger carriers. After all, if operating cost is the same, why not build it larger?</p>
              <p>And I think there is a misunderstanding between startup cost and operating cost. Startup cost, yes, the CV may be less expensive, but in maintainance? No. You don't need to fuel your airbase to stop it drifting, power systems is the PUB's problem, same with water, troop rotations need not be airflown out, hulls need to be barnacled, hell, you don't really even need large personel quarters or PX, just give the staff office hours and you can kiss your housing problems goodbye. PX? Can't beat Macdonalds. :P</p>
              <p>So, yes, think it saves on startup, but long term, it loses.</p>
              <p>Not to mention, what plane are we going to embark on the carrier?</p>
              </div>
              </blockquote>
              <p>The later CVL/CVEs eg Juan Carlos have much lower operating cost due to lower manpower and higher mechanisation.</p>
              <p>243 complement vs 5,000 for a nimitz class. Won't be the same operating cost or construction cost.</p>
              <p>Ship fuel could be ~1,000 tonnes per operational full day at sea ~ 3 times FFGs.</p>
              <p>There are benchmarks on CVL maintenance. UK ark royal &amp; illustrious cost S$125-175m to maintain annually. But that's with 700 crew and that could account for 1/3 of the maintenance cost.</p>
              <p><a href="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200405/ldhansrd/vo050124/text/50124w03.htm">http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200405/ldhansrd/vo050124/text/50124w03.htm</a></p>
              <p>Long term wise, it doesn't lose as the airbase land generates revenue from property taxes, DC charges, rentals etc. That will be far more than the above maintenance cost.</p>
              <p>Agree with the comments regarding benefits of airbase. But there's cost savings also. No security guards/field defense sqn (shared security with current port premise), etc and other operational aspect as discussed in earlier thread.</p>
              <p>However, the issue of staff rotation is similar. Just going to port rather than airbase. The ship doesn't sail 24/7. When CV is in port, aircraft bases with remaining airbase. When ship at sea, its like overseas exercise.</p>

              <p>I got the 71 figure from Mindef so I presume that's also official.<br><a href="http://www.mindef.gov.sg/weapons/frigate/capabilities.asp">http://www.mindef.gov.sg/weapons/frigate/capabilities.asp</a></p>
              <p>A lot of the reason is due to workflow process improvement ie multi-tasking and automation. One example of lower number is bridge personnel (normally 7 now 4) using the integrated bridge system. Example of automation eg LTARs automatic deployment of sonar.</p>

              Alongside the new procedures did we also cut the number of shifts for certain roles, and does the ship need more crew in war time?
              
              With 68 out of164 the ship is sailing with half of its design crew. When the CG-47 was upgraded, they only cut 40 crew out of over 350, mostly traditional roles like lookouts and backup helmsmen that were outdated.
              
              Seems incredible that DCN designed a ship from the ground up without realising they had too many men aboard.

              <p>There is a hint in the above.</p>
              <p>Quote: Our Formidable-class frigates are a good example of how we have been able to operate a capability with fewer people. It has a crew half of what many other navies need to operate a similar class of ship. And now other navies, including the US Navy, are beginning to operate ships of this size and class with similar sizes of crew that we are now operating.</p>

              <p>He is presumably referring to the LCS which has a crew of 75 (including mission crew).</p>

              <p>As for the carrier, it's pretty much a no brainer. Singapore is NOT going to get one, especially if they have to buy a whole air-wing of carrier based fighters just to stock it too. And I hesitate to think how it'll handle in the Straits of Malacca.</p>

              <p>As for the -35, I'll believe in it when the 1st sale is made.
              Won't be the 1st time an international project got shitcanned, the

              <p>As for the carrier, it's pretty much a no brainer. Singapore is
              NOT going to get one, especially if they have to buy a whole
              air-wing of carrier based fighters just to stock it too. And I
              hesitate to think how it'll handle in the Straits of Malacca.</p>

              <p>Tell me the story of the M-60- as far as I know it was developed domestically from the M-48 and widely exported. I'm inferring you mean MBT 70.</p>
