              <p>SBS2601D, I never said the Aster 15 could not be developed. In fact there's already the Aster 30. As for comparing the SM2 to a Harpoon, what the heck are you on about? The SM2 and Harpoon aren't compared due to different roles. You should be comparing the Aster 30 to the SM2. You don't have a damn clue about what's going on, because these mistakes you make are basic mistakes that more informed ppl woundn't be making. At least slim10 has some background. You're hopeless.</p>
              <p>If the Formidables were to upgrade to Aster 30, then they would also have to upgrade their radar and sensors to accommodate for the increased range of the Aster 30 as well. At 3200t displacement, this would be a difficult (but not impossible) task.</p>
              <p>And if you want to say that the current Herakles radar is good enough, then suit yourself. However other countries wouldn't be spending a heap load of money on more advanced radars for no reason, would they?</p>
              <p>As for storywolf, Formidables do not have Aster 30 yet. They could have, but I can only comment about the present. If you want to compare the reliability of a Harpoon vs an AIM54 Phoenix that's up to you. Can you seriously risk your ships to danger just because a missile might not be reliable? Regardless of this bizarre point you make, I'm sure the Harpoons are reliable enough.</p>
              <p>As for the USS Stark, it is a OHP class frigate. The Americans don't really rely on their OHP for offensive duties do they?</p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">The rest, they have too vast a terrority to defend, make it hard for them to risk assembling a strike force which could use up 1/2 to all of their su-30 !!!</span> </p>
              <p>Your comment above is an assumption, pure speculation that doesn't warrant a response.</p>

              <p>Good!</p>
              <p>Keep your misinfo that way.</p>
              <p>Just like how most people never knew that our Fokker 50s could actually fire Harpoons till much later when it was announced. (Military nutters aside.<img title="Laughing" src="http://sgforums.com/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing">)</p>
              <p>Nobody said the Formidable class is damn good. Yet to say that it can't support the Aster 30 is vastly unfair to the guys who thought of potential growth to the ship.</p>
              <p>Even so....you clearly dont do any homework. The Aster 30's detection range can't possibly be beyond the Formidable's radar.</p>
              <p>Seriously you guys can keep debating about stuff like these, but like I say, much of it is best left unsaid.</p>

              <p><br> Even if the FFGs are equipped with aster 30s (or aster 60s if
              there's such a thing in the future), that's not going to stop air
              launched harpoons. Principally, low level/stand-off pop
              up attacks are always a b*tch to tackle without air cover.
              Same reason why sea-dart armed DDGs in Falklands couldn't prevent
              exocet firings from the Super Etendards.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The best solution is early AEW detection with air cover ie
              CVs. The problem with land based air cover is the endurance and
              positioning. Cue: That's the principal role of the escort
              carrier.</p>

              <p>Of course, I wouldn't suggest that CVs should operate without AEW cover.  Then again, what navalized AEW cover do we have for mini-CVs? </p>
              <p>We **Could** fly our E-2Cs off a catapult assisted carrier, but recovery?  If the CV has to rely on landbased AEW cover, it would thus be limited by the range of that AEW aircraft.  </p>
              <p>Missiles that can reach further, I contend can more adequately protect any surface ship than short range ones on its own.   My logic is simple, the further I can reach to attack the missile first, the more shot opportunities I have on it without wasting too many missiles.  Short ranged missiles, I have to take 2 or more shots in fairly short intervals at a single target to guarantee the safety of the ship.  Longer reaching missiles can also take advantage of LOAL capabilities.</p>

              <p><br>I agree with the above. I doubt if a mini-CV can take a E-2. But I like the G-550's range.</p>

              <p>Usually a frigate - like formidable would have the rader with range to see far enough to detect ship and planes, in normal condition. Of course when it come to wave top sea skimming - yes there may be blind spot.<br><br>UAV or USV  may not need to carry a powerful rader - but how you position them. As UAV with look down radar - flying planes or missile - trying to use terrain masking or sea skimming will be detect easier with look down radar. </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Or USV - which is send out to the outer perimeter, should be able to detect planes or missile - as the plane or missile would be visible to the USV radar in close range, but still is advance warning to the main fleet.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Balloon or small air ship with radar also been think of in the past by other navy. <br><br>But with our Airforce having a good size tanker fleet, and longer range fighters like f-16s &amp; f-15s, it is possible for the airforce to conduct forward sweep to clear any threads ahead or side.

              <p>I can almost confirm that Spore has ordered the Aster 30s although I have no idea whether delivery has taken place. If I am not wrong, the Formidables are designed to carry a mix of Aster 15s and 30s.</p>
              <p>The reason why I conclude that it is almost certain that Spore has ordered the Aster 30s was because I went to the Spore airshow last year. And I visited the MBDA booth. It was stated that the Aster 30s were in service with 3 or 4 named navies(can't really remb, if not wrong is France, UK, Spain and Italy) and 1 other unnamed navy. That spiked my interest of course,  and because at that time I also heard unconfirmed reports that Spore has shown keen interests in the Aster 30s and that the launchers fitted  on later ships of the Formidable class are actucally the A50(which can launch both Aster 15s and 30s if I am not wrong). I spoke to those manning the booth and I must say they were rather coy on who was the unnamed customer, refusing to say anything. Well, I went to the extent of saying "is it the country in which we are now in?" and their reply was just a smile, a twinkle and the usual " sorry, I cannot say more,". But I surmise it means an implicit admission that Spore was the unnamed customer.</p>
              <p>Also if this is to be believed: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aster_15">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aster_15</a>,  it does show that the Formidables are equipped with the Aster 30s.</p>

              <p>Spartan, that's interesting. It may take a decade just to conceptualise and plan how a ship might operate and integrate into the navy. An example would be how long China took to make the decision to build its cv (and still to date, nothing being built yet).</p>
