              Each CV will carry 12 F-35B and surge to 36 or more when needed.
              
              "In extreme circumstances, and given a little notice, it would be possible to have both carriers available at once, he said."

              <p>Good points. The counter argument is as follows.</p>
              <p>(a) How do many navies survive with just 1 carrier e.g. China, India, Brazil, Spain, Italy etc. Can navies live without 2 or more?</p>
              <p>(b) Does the CV need that many escort vessels (per Spain, Italy and Brazil's experience) vis a vis size of current RSN? In WW2, carriers were used as escort vessels (CVE or CVL) rather than fleet carriers. CVE were used to escort merchant vessels. CVL to escort/supplement fleet carriers.</p>
              <p>(c) As to cost, can RSAF save cost by reducing foreign air training cost (using CVE or CVL for training in international waters where Singapore does not get restricted by air space)? How much will a CVE cost as opposed to an Endurance 160? Can RSAF save even more cost if this reduces airbase land area instead of just buying standard fixed wing fighters?</p>
              <p>(d) From a doctrine perspectives, doesn't Singapore have to protect SLOC? If so, why wouldn't a CVE be more effective than current vessels?</p>

              <p>a) They can survive even without any carrier. But if they invest in only 1, they will not have a continuously on duty carrier on the sea. Their enemy will choose to attack the weakest link, wait till the carrier return to port then attack the target on sea. Or directly attack the carrier when it is defenseless during repair and maintenance.</p>
              <p><br>b) Carrier is powerful because of its aircrafts can reach very far. But it still has many blindspot and loophole from water surface, land, undersea, mine etc. That's when the fleet is needed to protect it. Carrier is too expensive with so many equipments and only son of many families on it, so the risk of being hit must be minimized.<br>One problem I can think of is, if the war is with Malaysia or Indonesia, it will be difficult to go through Malacca strait because the strait can be as narrow as 2.7km. Their aircraft and missiles can reach from any angle anytime without much time for us to react.</p>
              <p>c) I not sure about the cost. There are many countries after purchasing and using the first carrier, then realized how fast it can burn the cash. Some afford to buy but can't afford to use it.<br><br>Singapore SLOC is not under any threatening. In fact, it is other countries SLOC that comes into the picture in this region.<br>Singapore really don't need carrier. I think it is US that hope Singapore to buy their retired 2nd hand downgraded carrier to fund their economy recovery. They have no money and credibility to fight more war so they want Singapore to foot the bill...<br><br>Seriously as a small country, we shouldn't side any power, we should be neutral so both sides will try to make us happy. If we choose to side one and offend the other, singapore will lose all the bargaining power to the so called "friend" at the same time create more enemy. Really not worth it.</p>

              <p>Hi all, just to share some facts here.</p>
              <p>We have adequate airbases located at strategic locations all over Singapore. The RSAF is swift enough to respond to any possible air threats. The RSN have multiple LSTs capable of carrying medium sized helicopters. Our Navy maybe small but its capabilities are highly recognised by US Forces too.</p>
              <p>An aircraft carrier doesn't go out alone in the sea. But with a fleet of destroyers and cruisers, and stealth submarines to protect it.</p>
              <p>Having an aircraft carrier is not only a waste of resources, but we also don't have the capability to power it. An aircraft carrier requires 5000 sea and air crew. Even if we combine both RSN and RSAF together, they don't even have that much manpower in current existing units and squadrons.</p>
              <p>Our government has no intentions to procure any aircraft carriers and most likely in the next decade as well.</p>

              <p>Weasel - the CVE is too large and lack needed manoeuvre, need to defence itself of other from submarines , air or sea attack .</p>
              <p>Also it is too cost to have a CVE - escort ships .</p>
              <p>Air base still a lot time cheap and easier to operate then CV</p>
              <p>A CVE - so small the number of planes even if launch for strike will do little damage. It is still better of launching missile from frigate at them instead.</p>

              <p>Changi Naval base can dock a 5000+ pax nimitz class CVN and accompanying fleet but we need more space for a single CVE? Somehow I don't think so.</p>

              <p>The price (and availability) of land was not an issue when our air bases were built 50-70+ years ago. Today, any Singaporean will tell you land prices and availability are an issue. Where in Singapore can a land based airport be placed strategically safe and cheap? The latest RSAF runway (CAB) is just 1km from the naval base. Not many places left for a 3-5 sq km air base. A runway can't move. A CVE can.</p>

              <p>3-5sq km of prime real estate = cheap? Do you guys stay in Singapore? Seen the newspapers today on price of industrial land? Not to mention suburban condos going at $1500 or more per square foot. An airbase redevelopment will yield as much as $33 billion, generate GDP growth plus property taxes (also going up 5-13% in 2013) every year.</p>
                      
                      <p>That compared to the cost of a CVE that could cost as low as $600 million. No one is suggesting going around the world to make trouble. See post 1 plus the need to understand what a CVE does (as opposed to a fleet carrier).</p>
              
              <p>btw, airbases need expensive fighters too. Like the US$3+b we spent on a sqn of F-15s or even more for future F-35As. Also, 4x KC-135s will not be able to maintain 24/7 cover over a trailing fleet at 15kts more than 1000nm away.</p>

              Let's not be kwa chang. No one is suggesting turning Tekong into Jurong Island (though computerised training of not only recruits but NSmen/regulars are becoming more prevalent). Defence does not come with zero cost. Scarce resources = resource allocation required. That's economics 101. An airbase (and an airport) comes with cost-benefit or we'd still be using Paya Lebar as our international airport.
              
              The reality is that number of aircraft squadrons and fighters are declining. Again simple economics due to increasing aircraft capability and increased unit cost. However, same number of airbases maintained. Basing options should be assessed for efficiency. If economics not considered, that's where you get suggestions of multiple CVNs (crewed by non-striking FT).
              
              Airplane design is evolving. SLOC defence needs are changing. Defence costs are going up. I would expect Gahmen to managed defence budget carefully and not just pay $billions to buy new fighter sqns or under-utilise facilities.

              <p><br>i think money is needed to tunnel, but design no need very super. maybe just accessiblity to rapir and hangar facilities. as for entry we can have mmultiple. the main idea is to have two in series. one major access is reinforced, underground. while the multiple entry exit ones are  light not armor and also can be manually operated or easily cleared, position on ground level.  i think we have underground ammo sotrage too. land space in constraint so we can really go underground for this type of military facility.</p>

              Hi weasel
              If building a carrier vs airbase is for economic reason such as saving land , why there is no company or government ever move their office, factory, school or whatever to sea?
                                Furthermore, we are putting all the aircrafts and lifes on the floating platform that can be sunk by just 1 highly explosive bomb.
                                
                                Having a carrier will not make Singapore a strong country, but will rather weaken it.
                                What makes Singapore strong is a strong economy, good relationship with other countries, strategic geographic location, stable society.
                                If we buy one carrier and the necessary fleets etc, the first 3 will be damaged, and soon will cause social unrest.
