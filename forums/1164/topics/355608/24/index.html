              Sure, all these toys are as "affordable" as $2000 psf condos or
              $100k <strong>COE</strong> cars. How much additional fare

              <p>I agree fully that raising bus fares is an easy way out for the minister, the more difficult way out is to cut the ministers salaries</p>
              <p>the real problem is that the bus drivers deserve higher salaries but they don't get it, the ministers don't deserve the high salaries but they take it.</p>

              If you look at the defence budget, the question is whether there are ways to generate more income, change how procurement works and manage defence $ better instead of merely think of defence expenditure as a straight line cost?
              
              That's the same argument with the CVE. One can either look at the CVE or new fighters as merely extra $$$ spent or go back to the first question on page 23. Its a way of showing that CVEs can be more than affordable due to the trade-offs....or we can stick to the usual strategy of just pay more for defence.

              <p> Actually, there is segregation, otherwise why need so many ministries? MOF is responsible for Government budget. Personnally, I know MOF and Mindef works very closely on defence expenditure. Every ministry will have to provide a budget. If you think facilities management don't come under DSTA, think again. Infrastructure management comes under systems management. New camp etc all need money. Old camp gets demolished get redeveloped. Last one I can think of was Seletar.</p>

              <p>I still don't think PLAB is fully utilised. Emergency runway probably gets invoked at most once a year (and there are lots of alternative commercial emergency runways in the region.). As to ST maintenance/servicing, I don't see much difficulty to shift those ops to other airbases. Most of the freight ops goes out of Changi/Seletar. Agree that Government, particularly the RSAF, will not lightly give up any of the airbases. Its easier just to budget $XX billions for new aircraft acquisition.</p>
              
              <p>Canada has just audited numbers to suggest 65 F-35As will cost C$44.8b (S$55.55b) for a 42 year service life or S$855m per F-35A. That's how much more SG taxpayers will just have to fork out per option A if we ignore option B. Pay and pay loh.</p>

              China on the other hand, has been doing more than just issuing commemorative aircraft carrier coins. They are also building even more oilers to support the growing fleet.

              <p>China approves research funding for nuclear reactors that <span style="text-decoration: underline;">may</span> power aircraft carriers</p>
              <p>http://www.ptinews.com/news/3405961_China-approves-funding-for-nuclear-powered-ships-</p>
              <p>News is not new as a CVN has been suggested under a type 089 project since 2007. Indeed, China was then suggested to be intending to build 1-2 Varyag sized carriers under a type 085 project by 2015. LHD projects have also been suggested under type 075 projects. A research project on nuclear propulsion is expected to take several years to complete. Some analysts have suggested that the study may be completed earlier if the propulsion system is based on existing submarine reactors (possibly multiple units hooked up together). imho, submarine nuclear reactors generate a lot less electricity than CVNs as the usage patterns are different. In the context of increasing china oil imports, the move to nuclear propulsion (even for commercial marine applications where supertankers can be as big or larger than CVNs) is not surprising.</p>

              Since you guys say its too costly and high maintenance to have a aircraft carrier... Why dont we invest in a escort carrier??
              
              We can convert a ocean liner or a oil tanker into a escort carrier, we need not pay extra to purchase a ship...
              
              An example would be in 1942, Japanese Imperial Navy converted a ocean liner Scharnhorst into a Escort Carrier Shinyo...

              instead of an aircraft carrier, how about a submarine and aircraft hybrid?
              
              that means the aircraft is capable of submerging into the waters and if rapid deployment is required, it gets out of the water and fly using its aircraft engine
              
              this design was proposed and made by the Russians during WW II, but the tech requirements were just simply too complicated at that time
