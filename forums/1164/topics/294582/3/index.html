Could the Israeli general be talking about "jamming" enemy comms? I could be wrong but I think they did that with SDW (Six Day War).<br><br>With military radio comms there is actually no "structure" to bomb. There may be mobile relay vehicles but there's no " communications " building. Bombing the telephone exchange may help but it takes only a short time - maybe one or two days? - for them to switch to wartime military radio comms.<br><br>...<br><br>And since TS is probably talking about a SDW-style surprise attack. All the more reason to take out the air force first.<br><br>(Of course, if we can spare the assets we should target their ability to communicate.)<br><br>If we finish off their air forces and air defences, they can communicate all they want but they ain't gonna get any where in a hurry since they can only walk or take the bus. And these we can then bomb at leisure.</div></blockquote>Yes,  I remember Israel artiliary took out the runway airport in lebanon before launching the strike.
