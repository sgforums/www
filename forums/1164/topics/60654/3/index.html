They rely on US as a strategic balance to counter-balance growing threat from developing military powers such as China and India. They also rely on their geographical isolation and mass to deter foreign military  ambitions.<br><br>Somehow but strange , many forumners view ADF as a very potent force.

Local media tend to attach their bias when they deliver information.  At times they can lose their creditability and objectivity.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote>perhaps u can start wif some context - ur rank, apptment, unit (?)</blockquote>of course not. Apologies for that.<br><br><blockquote>den when u went and when u came back</blockquote>went there as the last rotation. came back recently only. Being there longer than planned.<br><br><blockquote>den the trg u all went thru normally and to prep for peacekeeping.</blockquote>Pre-course was thorough. Fibua, ranges, technical handling of SAR21 and pistol, lots of lectures on country, lectures/practicals on first aid, do's and don'ts in the country, general admin like allowances etc.<br><br><blockquote>den things u all do there (those things shown on tv can say rite?) interesting experiences.</blockquote>I did a lot of planning and was able to see a lot of the overall picture. Recieved info - assessed situation and threat - true or false alarm? - if true, activate planning - write orders  - activate plan and orders - log all actions and correspondence - gain and present overall situation/actions/awareness  - lesson learnt.<br><br>I don't do those ground work. Those shown on TV are the troopers. They carry out our orders. Most of those activities shown on tv are blue hat patrols or CMA activities.<br><br>Life is very routine over here. Over time, you feel pretty down. That's when the holidays and vocation play a part to increase your morale. To pass time quickly, i developed a daily routine. Morning wake up, eat breakfast. After bfast, check mail, check PDA for outstanding tasks, do the tasks, after shift/duty - jog/gym, dinner, after dinner, evening brief to commander, after brief, watch movie, sleep. That's it. Nothing spectacular. Nothing grand. I do travel quite a bit, to the junction pts and to the capital. Tat's when i see the spectacular view from the top.<br>My best achievement? Climb the highest mountain in Timor Leste at 2968m. Bloody cold up there. I tot my fingers gonna dropped off anytime.<br><br>Lastly, i took plenty of pics. Brought a compact canon v2 and a SLR-like fujifilm S602Z there. Oh..i think singaporeans are well known for their gadgets over there.<br><br><blockquote>o cos omit those sensitive parts.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></blockquote>yes i will.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><br><blockquote>How would you rate the ADF in terms of competence, professionalism and proficency?  Their operations in E. Timor os called Operation Citadel right?</blockquote>How did you know the name of their operation?<br>The ADF is a very professional army. Learn many things from them. They have gone thru many operations all over the world, which will put them one up above us.<br><br>I won't go into ratings or details, but the things that left a lasting impression on me were<br>1) Their rank structure. Their spec progress from pte, cpl, sgt, wo1 then wo2. Each of the rank last quite a number of yrs. All the ranks are very proficient and competent in their job areas - professionalism. A cpl can stand up and give a fantastic presentation to a 2 star general.<br>2) War stories. Happened to make friend with a pte who went thru somalia. Another one was a captain, who left the army as a RSM and became a mercenary, then came back to work in the army cos his wife prefer him to settle down into a much peaceful job. Their war stories were amazing. I took the chance to ask them how it felt to be shot at and to kill ppl.<br>3) Superb commanders. Their leaders are true leaders. Examplery conduct and performance, admired and respected by all. Every single one of their platoon commanders can outrun most of our local officers. In fact, everyone of them love running. When they punish their men, they do the punishment together. Not wayang, but it's part of their culture.<br><br><blockquote>I visited a forum frequented by our neigbours up north and they had some very rude comments about the Aussies, I'd like to hear your opinion.</blockquote>May i know the URL of this forum? I cannot deny that some aussies, like some black sheeps, will definitely have the arrogant white man attitude.</div>
