But compared to the SBO, it is rather warm and clearning SOC won't be as comfortable.<br><br>The troopers do 2 type of patrols, green and blue. Green for recon stuff and blue is with the blue UN cap, patrolling into the village doing CMA (Civil Military Affairs) stuff i.e. mingling with the locals, getting to know them as well as their concerns and lastly to make your presence felt.<br><br>Officers and warrants are issued with the additional Sig Sauer P226 pistols. Since everyone is operating in an operational theater, there is a required to be armed at all times. Weapon will be "actioned" once you leave a defined area.<br><br>Everyone is also issued with a body armour to be worn when you are outside a defined area, i.e. POB/COB (platoon/company operating base).<br><br>Hope this helps to clear some of your doubts.</div>
