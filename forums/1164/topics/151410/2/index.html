Given that the AA-12 does have greater range/maneuverability than the AIM-120, future versions we will probably acquire eg. AIM-120C-7, with extended range/maneuverability, and even the current version we use, have better ECCM compared to the AA-12. coupled with our superior C4ISR network and electronic warfare capabilities, ensure that if our vipers get the shot off (and they probably will with the help of awacs), the flanker is as good as dead.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>Quoted from dwightlooi, taken from WAFF</strong>:<br><br>Do can believe the Russian's claim on the range of the R-77 if you want and you can believe that the AIM-120 is a 48km missile. But the truth is probably that the R-77 won't hit anything at 120km and the AIM-120C will kill something way beyond 48km. Why do I say that? Because the US leads the world in solid propellant technology. American solid motors have the highest specific impulse -- this is true in both military and space applications. Basically, there are two ways to get better kinetic range in a missile. You can make the motor more energetic or you can make the airframe, warhead and guidance lighter. The US already leads the field in solid motor performance -- detailed explanation on this issue is another topic for another time -- so that leaves lightening and payload reduction. It is possible to reduce the warhead, guidance package size/mass fraction in relation to the missile's propellant fraction. This will yield a notable increase in range. This is what is done on the AIM-120C7 -- the electronics are shrunk, the warhead is moved forward and the length of the rocket motor extended. However, nothing about the R-77 suggests this. In fact even the pre-C7 AIM-120C5 has a higher motor volume fraction than the R-77 and I won't bet on russian electronics being featherlight despite the volume they take up.<br><br>So why is it that the Russians can claim that the R-77 as a 150km missile? Are they lying? Probably not! You there is no such thing as "a" maximum range for AAMs. The range a missile is effective depends on the launch profile and the target profile. Ballistically, both the R-77 and the AIM-120 will fly out to more than 200km if they are launched at a high altitude. However neither missile will hit anything but a Zepplin at the range. The effective envelope for a missile can range from less than 20km to more than 100km depending on how you shoot it and against what. Flying at Mach 2 against another Mach 2 aircraft coming ahead on at a lower altitude gives your missile a lot of range. You can probably launch in excess of 150km and you will likely kill your enemy he he doesn't break and turn tail immediately. If you are just coming out of a tight turn near sea level and you are shooting at a Mach 2 aircraft flying away from you at high altitude, chances are your missile won't catch him if he is more than 15 km away! There can be a factor of ten difference effective range for an medium range AAM depending on the tectical scenario. So, yes, the Russians probably are not lying when they say that the maximum range of the R-77 is over 150km -- because the missile should be able to kill something flying in some kind of scenario. But, you can say the same about the AIM-120C! Hence, official range claims are quite meaningless and highly misleading.<br><br>The AIM-120C has a very impressive, proven combat record. In fact, nothing has thus far proven effective in jamming it. When launched within its proper envelope it almost always hits.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>It's been interesting following all the discussions on this topic but I seriously think that alot of people are missing the point here.<br><br>The Typhoon and Rafale are without doubt the sexier and newer airframes.  In an Air Superiority role I have no doubt they will kick ass and clean up the F-15C/D/E/T.<br><br>BUT if the RSAF's requirement is for an air superiority fighter then why is the strike variant, the F-15E/T in the tender and not the F-15C/D fighter variant?<br><br>I would guess that the RSAF's requirements (which none of us are privy to) is for a strike aircraft and in that the F-15 is the best candidate ... longer legs and heavier payload?</div>
