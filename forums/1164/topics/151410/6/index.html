            <div class='col-md body'>Don't forget the purpose of the new fighter. It is a replacement for the A4SU, which is a strike platform, not an air-superiority platform. The F-15T has the largest bomb load, the longest range and excellent avionics at a very good price. The package also includes numerous PGMs to complement the strike role.<br><br>The F-16s are our air superiority platform, and are planned to be replaced by the F-35 when it becomes available. We are third in line to get the JSF, after the US and UK.<br><br>People comparing the F-15T to the SU-30 or other air superiority platforms should be knocked on the head. This is not a contest to see who has the sexiest plane in SEA. This is a contest to replace 70+ A4SU. It had to be cheap, and with a big bomb load if we are going to replace the mud moving power of those 70 planes. The long range, speed and avionics are just icing on the cake.</div>

The Rafale was last price for Sg was EUR 75 for every 2 units.  I have to salute to Sg for the way it negotiate for such a bargain price, like the Formidable frigates it had brought at the low price.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>anyway... i really think this decision has a lot of political consideration. China seems to be trying to isolate us(or the other way round?) by having a defence pact with malaysia and Indonesia. Remember the news of Thailand wanting to open up an new trade route by opening some river? China also wanna help them since they do not have the technology. If that trade route really opens up, what do you think will happen to us? We gonna lose most, if not all, of our port business since travelling through thailand is a shorter route from China to India. So I do believe that F15T might be an affirmation of our ties with the Americans.<br><br>But let's face it... whether or not it's better than the SU-30s...

            <div class='col-md body'>I am indeed sadden by the news that RSAF is going to get the F-15T instead of the Rafale. But come to think of it...we have really got a real bargain! If you compare the prices between the Rafale and the F-15T, you can see the big difference and given that in Euro, the price is even higher after conversion. Comparism of price between other variants of F-15s also shown that ours is cheaper. Please also remember that our model is currently one of the most advanced in the world. It is currently better than what the US and South Korea have and maybe even slightly better than what Isarel have. Definitely value for money!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"></div>

The total value, if all options are exercised, could be as high as $741 million.<br><br>The Government of Singapore has requested a possible sale of<br><br>Major Defense Equipment (MDE)<br><br>200 AIM-120C Advanced Medium Range Air-to-Air Missiles (AMRAAM);<br><br>6 AMRAAM Captive Air Training (CAT) Missiles;<br><br>50 MK-82 GBU-38 Joint Direct Attack Munitions (JDAM) w/BLU-111 warhead;<br><br>44 AN/AVS-9(V) Night Vision Goggles;<br><br>24 Link 16 Multifunctional Information Distribution System/Low Volume Terminals (Fighter Data Link<br>Terminals);<br><br>30 AGM-154A-1 Joint Standoff Weapons w/BLU-111;<br><br>30 AGM-154C Joint Standoff Weapons;<br><br>200 AIM-9X SIDEWINDER Missiles;<br><br>24 AIM-9X SIDEWINDER CAT and Dummy Missiles;<br><br>Non- MDE<br><br>300,000 20mm Practice Round Cartridges;<br><br>100 KMU-556 GBU-31 JDAM Tail Kit Assemblies;<br><br>4 MK-82 and MK-84 Bomb Practice trainers; and<br><br>testing; integration; devices; containers; common munitions built-in test reprogramming equipment; mission<br>data production system; drones; technical coordination program; engine component management program;<br>aircrew safety equipment; foreign liaison officer administration support; training equipment; repair and return<br>services; technical assistance; missile planning system; technical orders; electronic warfare systems and<br>support; weapons trainers; weapon system reports; missile container; spare and repair parts; supply support;<br>integration and technical services; spares; support and test equipment; personnel training and training<br>equipment; software support; publications and technical documentation; training; life support and survival<br>equipment; studies and surveys; ground support equipment; training missiles; U.S. Government and contractor<br>technical and logistics personnel services and other related elements of logistics support. The estimated cost is<br>$741 million.<br><br>Singapore has requested a competition between U.S. contractors and foreign competitors for an aircraft<br>program. If Singapore selects the F-15 aircraft, the aircraft and engines will be purchased commercially, for<br><br>which there would be an eventual 36(c) notification of the commercial sale. This proposed sale includes the<br>weapons and logistics support for the F-15 aircraft.<br><br>This proposed sale will contribute to the foreign policy and national security of the United States by helping to<br>improve the security of a friendly country that has been, and continues to be, an important force for economic<br>progress in Southeast Asia.<br><br>This proposed sale will provide Singapore with a credible self-defense capability that will deter aggression in<br>the region and ensure interoperability with U.S. forces for coalition operations. Current U.S. Government<br>policy is to enhance and strengthen our relationship with Singapore and this proposed sale will bring our two<br>militaries closer together. Other countries in the region already or will soon possess this capability. Singapore<br>needs these munitions to modernize its defensive capability, increase interoperability with U.S. forces, and<br>provide a viable deterrent force in protection of vital ports and waterways. Singapore will use these munitions<br>in defense of its sovereignty, or as part of an international coalition. These munitions will significantly improve<br>its military capability by providing an intermediate-range anti-aircraft capability. Singapore is a modern, high-<br>tech nation that can absorb these weapons into its armed forces.<br><br>The proposed sale of this equipment and support will not affect the basic military balance in the region.<br><br>The principal contractors will be Raytheon Missile System Corporation of Tucson, Arizona and Boeing<br>Integrated Defense Solutions of St. Louis. There are no known offset agreements proposed in connection with<br>this potential sale.<br><br>There will be up to 10 U.S. Government personnel and 10 contractor representatives for two-week intervals<br>annually to participate in program management and technical reviews.<br><br>There will be no adverse impact on U.S. defense readiness as a result of this proposed sale.<br><br>This notice of a potential sale is required by law; it does not mean that the sale has been concluded.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>In considering the acquisition of the F15T,  perhaps it will also be useful to consider how this complements our purchase of the F16 C/D series. The aircraft is supposed to be for SEAD operations which would be a sound complement to the F15T strike role.</div>
