            <div class='col-md body'>Actually F15T is a very powerful strike plane, it is capable to doing all the high g stunts even with full weapon load. In addition, the combat radius and loitering time is higher than the F16 and F18. This has given us a very key advantage when we perform long distance strike mission.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>That's why Sg is smart, we have so much foreign talents and $$$ in our country. Moreover, we have naval and aerial facility for Uncle Sam to use. If some stupid man try to play funny tricks on us, eg putting some of their rockets MLRS unit within 50Km from here, it will kenna alot of political pressure from Uncle SAM. Nobody can move anything under the nose of Uncle Sam w/o his approval, u know?</div>
