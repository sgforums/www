            <div class='col-md body'>AGM-154A Joint Standoff Weapon [JSOW]<br>The AGM-154A Joint Standoff Weapon or JSOW is currently under development by Raytheon [Texas Instruments] for the Air Force and the Navy. The AGM-154A (Formerly Advanced Interdiction Weapon System) is intended to provide a low cost, highly lethal glide weapon with a standoff capability. JSOW family of kinematically efficient, air-to-surface glide weapons, in the 1,000-lb class, provides standoff capabilities from 15 nautical miles (low altitude launch) to 40 nautical miles (high altitude launch). The JSOW will be used against a variety of land and sea targets and will operate from ranges outside enemy point defenses. The JSOW is a launch and leave weapon that employs a tightly coupled Global Positioning System (GPS)/Inertial Navigation System (INS), and is capable of day/night and adverse weather operations. The JSOW uses inertial and global positioning system for midcourse navigation and imaging infra-red and datalink for terminal homing.<br><br>The JSOW is just over 13 feet in length and weighs between 1000-1500 pounds. Extra flexibility has been engineered into the AGM-154A by its modular design, which allows several different submunitions, unitary warheads, or non-lethal payloads to be carried. The JSOW will be delivered in three variants, each of which uses a common air vehicle, or truck, while substituting various payloads.<br><br>AGM-154A (Baseline JSOW)The warhead of the AGM-154A consists of 145 BLU-97/B submunitions. Each bomblet is designed for multi-target in one payload. The bomblets have a shaped charge for armor defeat capability, a fragmenting case for material destruction, and a zirconium ring for incendiary effects.<br><br>AGM-154B (Anti-Armor) The warhead for the AGM-154B is the BLU-108/B from the Air Force's Sensor Fuzed Weapon (SFW) program. The JSOW will carry six BLU-108/B submunitions. Each submunition releases four projectiles (total of 24 per weapons) that use infrared sensors to detect targets. Upon detection, the projectile detonates, creating an explosively formed, shaped charge capable of penetrating reinforced armor targets.<br><br>AGM-154C (Unitary Variant) The AGM-154C will use a combination of an Imaging Infrared (IIR) terminal seeker and a two-way data link to achieve point target accuracy through aimpoint refinement and man-in-the-loop guidance. The AGM-154C will carry the BLU-111/B variant of the MK-82, 500- pound general purpose bomb, equipped with the FMU-152 Joint Programmable Fuze (JPF) and is designed to attack point targets.<br><br>Texas Instruments (TI) Defense Systems &amp; Electronics (DS&amp;E) began Engineering and Manufacturing Development (E&amp;MD) of JSOW in 1992. In December 1995, the Navy and Texas Instruments completed Development Test IIB (DT-IIB) at the Naval Air Weapon Center, (NAWC) China Lake and Point Mugu, California, with 10 for 11 successful flights of the AGM-154A BLU-97 dispenser variant.<br><br>On January 6, 1997, it was announced that Texas Instruments Defense Systems &amp; Electronics was being purchased by Raytheon Company, Lexington, Massachusetts. The U.S. Navy began Operational Evaluation (OPEVAL) testing in February 1997, after successful development testing and initial operational testing programs. The test program resulted in a 42 for 44 success rate or greater than 96% successful JSOW launches. The Air Force began Development Test &amp; Evaluation (DT&amp;E) flight testing of JSOW on the F-16 at Eglin Air Force Base, Florida, in March 1996. Air Force testing of the baseline JSOW was hindered by less than desired progress in the area of F-16/JSOW integration. There was never a problem in the interface between the weapon and the aircraft. The weapon worked perfectly. The problem that prolonged the testing at Eglin, was with a subassembly of the JSOW, which was not manufactured by Texas Instruments.<br><br>AGM-154A (Baseline variant) system entered Low Rate Initial Production (LRIP) on schedule. The $65.9 million LRIP contract was awarded by the Naval Air Systems Command (NAVAIR), in Arlington, Virginia, for 111 JSOW AGM-154A/baseline systems. LRIP for the other two variants are scheduled for FY99 and FY00, respectively. On 29 December 1998 Raytheon Systems was awarded a $133,881,355 firm-fixed-price contract to provide funding for the Full Rate Production Lot 1 of JSOW AGM-154A and the Low Rate Initial Production Lot I of the JSOW AGM-154B (AGM-154A: Navy - 328 and Air Force - 75) (AGM-154B: Navy - 3 and Air Force - 21). Work is expected to be completed by March 2001.<br><br>JSOW test articles were deployed in 1997 aboard the USS Nimitz and are currently deployed on the USS Eisenhower. JSOW initial introduction to the operational commands was on the Navy/Marine Corps F/A-18 in mid-1998. As of late 1997 a number of remaining JSOW test assets were on an interim deployment for further operational evaluation. USS Carl Vinson 's air wing first employed the JSOW during combat over southern Iraq on Jan. 25, 1999.<br><br>On 29 December 1999 Raytheon Systems Company, Tucson, Ariz., was awarded a $109,573,867 modification to previously awarded contract N00019-99-C-1014 to exercise an option for the full rate production Lot 2 of the Joint Standoff Weapon AGM-154A for the U.S. Navy (414) and U.S. Air Force (74). Work will be performed in Tucson, Ariz., and was expected to be completed by March 2002.<br><br>On 23 June 2000 Raytheon was awarded a $5,069,914 modification to previously awarded cost plus incentive fee basic ordering agreement N00019-98-G-0104 for the integration of the Selective Availability Anti-Spoofing Module (SAASM) into the Joint Standoff Weapon (JSOW) System. This effort will bring new production JSOWs delivered after 1 April 2003 in compliance with current Global Positioning System (GPS) security requirements for weapon-based GPS. Work will be performed in Tucson, Ariz., and is expected to be completed by May 2001.<br><br>Weapon planning will be accomplished using the Navy's Tactical Automated Mission Planning System (TAMPS) and the Air Force Mission Support System (AFMSS). Aircraft-to-weapon communications will be via the MIL-STD-1760 interface, making inflight programming/targeting possible, as well as preflight data loading. The weapon will be deployed from both carrier- and land-based aircraft, employing insensitive munitions technology. The JSOW will be employed on the following aircraft: F/A-18A/B, C/D, and E/F; AV-8B; F-14A/B and /D; F-16C/D; F-15E; F-117; B-1B; and B-52.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Come on guys despite the F-15 being an old ariframe, it looks DAMN good. IMO i really think the F-15 suits the name the Eagle very well.<br><br>OKay in my honest opinion, i was a rafale supporter but looking at the things that we are getting from this buy is really good. And i am still wondering why they renamed it Next Fighter Replacement Programme. Perhaps like what some has mentioned, to hold out until F-35? But looking at it i think the F-15 greatly extended our operational range. We are now able to engage enemies further than ever before. I'd say let us welcome the Eagle.<br><br>Hmm hope if i can successfully become a pilot, i may get to fly one of the planes that i deem the most beautiful.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz"><br><br>btw the best looking plane to me is the F-14 with wings swept back.

            <div class='col-md body'>F-15t is one of the most powerful plane any nation can hope for.<br><br>Control of the sky.<br>With its superior radar, weapon, range &amp; engine, it basically control the sky. Yep people will say su-30 have vector-thrust ....., but remember the f-15t will be more then a match for it. With F-15t new radar, it have the advantage of BVR first shot. Even in close range, with helmet sights, and new off bore missiles, it is more than a match of any vector-thrust aircraft.  In fact with vector-thrusting came a new complexity in maintance and flying the plane, which may work against the plane. For the F-15t, it also have the superior thrust which ensure that if you cannot outmanuveour people, use brute raw power to get out of that situation.<br><br>Ground attack.<br>It is able to carry most weapons, including the advance weapons. Yep a lot of people may alway say go for the advance attack weapons, but then you also must see the cost of them, and if there is enough valuable target. The F-15t load one of the most impressive for bombing missions. Anything more will need delicated bombers like b-52 type of big planes.<br><br></div>

The twin-engine F-15 is equipped with new Pratt &amp; Whitney nozzles that can turn up to 20 degrees in any direction, giving the aircraft thrust control in the pitch (up and down) and yaw (left and right) directions. On March 27, 1996, NASA began flight testing a new thrust-vectoring concept on the F-15 research aircraft to improve performance and aircraft control. The new concept should lead to signifigant increases in performance of both civil and military aircraft flying at subsonic and supersonic speeds.

            <div class='col-md body'>The F-15 is a twin engine, high performance, all weather air superiority fighter. First flown on July 27, 1972, the Eagle entered USAF inventory on Nov. 14, 1974. It was the first U.S. fighter to have engine thrust greater than the normal weight of the aircraft, allowing it to accelerate while in a vertical climb. This, combined with low aircraft weight to wing area, makes the Eagle very highly manueverable. The Eagle has been produced in single-seat and two-seat versions.<br><br>The single-seat F15A on display, nicknamed "Streak Eagle," broke eight time-to-climb world records between Jan. 16 and Feb. 1, 1975. In setting the last of the eight records, it reached an altitude of 98,425 ft. just 3 minutes 27.8 seconds from brake release at takeoff and "coasted to nearly 103,000 ft. before descending. It was flown in its natural metal finish to reduce weight for the record-setting flights. To protect it from corrosion, McDonnell Douglas Corp. has since painted it in the gray color scheme of most operational F-15s.<br><br>This is F-15 K<br><br><img src="http://www.spacewar.com/images/f-15k-bg.jpg"><br><br><img src="http://www.defence.co.kr/html/bbs/data/magazine/F-15K.jpg"><br><br><img src="http://www.boeing.com/defense-space/military/f15/f-15k/intro/F15Kintro_r3_c3.jpg"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>The F-15K, like all F-15s, will be one of the world's most survivable aircraft. The combat-proven F-15 boasts an exceptional safety record, thanks to its advanced avionics systems, robust airframe, speed and maneuverability.<br>Combat aircraft survivability is largely determined by two factors: how well an aircraft avoids being hit and how well it can withstand a hit. The F-15 avoids and withstands hits with success unsurpassed by any aircraft that carries weapons or fuel tanks under its wings or fuselage.<br><br>The F-15K's integrated avionics and electronics systems provide exceptional situational awareness, giving its crew a better view of the battlespace than its enemy has. Its radar sweeps the air and ground for targets at long distances, allowing the crew to detect and attack with long-range weapons before the enemy knows what is happening. Advances in radar and weapon technology will further enhance these advantages.<br><br>The terrain-following system that allows the aircraft to fly at very low altitudes, its automated electronic jamming system integrated with a radar-warning receiver, and its smoke-free engines thwart enemy attempts to locate the aircraft.<br><br>The engines, which can propel the F-15 to speeds exceeding twice the speed of sound, and an airframe capable of 9 g maneuvers, allow the F-15 to routinely outmaneuver enemies.<br><br>The aircraft has a triple-redundant hydraulic system and redundant electrical generation system that prevent a single failure from ending a mission. Fuel dispersal throughout the wings, with none above the engines, a foam fire-suppression system, and self-sealing fuel lines significantly reduce the vulnerability of the aircraft's fuel system. In addition, much of the aircraft is made of fire-resistant titanium.<br><br>Each F-15K will carry a two-person crew. The division of duties between pilot and weapon system officer allows each to remain focused on their individual tasks without becoming overwhelmed and encountering dangerous mental and physical fatigue. Traditionally, aircraft with two-person crews have performed better than those with single-person crews.<br><br>For the long-range, multi-role missions flown under the challenging conditions at which the F-15 excels, these are significant advantages. Having two crewmembers in the cockpit is also advantageous in the event of injury or illness to one of them.<br><br>The F-15 has one of the best safety records in U.S. Air Force history. On those few occasions when an incident occurred, F-15s have safely landed after being hit by lightning, after withstanding a fuel-tank explosion, with destroyed tail sections and with half a wing missing.<br><br>Leveraging unchallenged experience, the F-15K offers proven, not merely promised survivability. The F-15K enjoys all the benefits that have contributed to the unmatched safety record of earlier F-15s.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>IMO, the F-15T is a good buy.  Look at the weapons sales and the AESA that comes with a COMBAT proven air frame.<br><br>The Strike Eagle may be based on the 1970s design, but is actually a totally different aircraft compared to the first McDonell Douglas F-15A that rolled off.  U simply cannot compare a strike eagle against a the F-15A.<br><br>Secondly, the Strike Eagle is a highly survivable aircraft.  It can really take serious beatings and walk away with it.  The classic one being a Strike Eagle that lost one wing and managed to return home and land.  Saving the pilot and WSO.  Honestly, I think the strike eagle will need at least 2 R-77s or R-73s to peg it for good.<br><br>As for the Dogfights.  Firstly, it doesnt happen very often nowadays. With AWACs overhead, most engagements would typically take place BVR.  Once BVR missiles have been launched, the launching aircraft generally peel off, and try to evade any BVR missiles counter-launched at it.  There is very little opportunities for Dogfights to happen nowadays.  Besides, with new helmet targetting systems, and the AIM-9X, i believe we do have a good chance against surprise encounters.<br><br>And the amraam outranged by amraamski thing.  Well, we really wont know until we start shooting.  On paper, the amraamski does have a range advantage over the AMRAAM, but then, all these range and launch envelopes are not absolute.  Older versions had an effective range of approx 25miles, and probably 15miles when it came to tailchases.  At BVR, if u can't out maneuver the missile, chances are u can still outrun it.   For the amraamski, we don't even know if its as accurate as claimed. I haven't heard of an R-77 launched in combat against another fighter.   Somebody comment please.<br><br>Finally, the most important part of the Strike Eagle.  Its almost unparalleled in the A2G role in for a Fighter. That is in terms of amount of ordnance it can carry, precision, and survivability. And just look at the variety of weapons it can use.  JSOWs... what de heck, talk about a bang for the buck!  With a platform like the F-15T, we can even throw in some addition A2G arms like the popeye series.<br><br>All in all, I think the F-15T is a good choice.  We need something that can replace our scooters in the a2g roles.<br><br></div>

Remember there is not a lot of targets to justified a larger number at this moment. We don't want to over invest till we have to use a F-15T to bomb someone toliet because we run out of targets.<br><br>As I say again to hell with classification of 4g !!! As I mention before, 1986 all three F-15E , rafale and eurofighter took their first flight ! So rafale is not really that impressive or new.
