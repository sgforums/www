Last year, govt announced that civil service will cut 3% of all ministries(except MINDEF) manpower annually from 2004- 2007. All minintries(except MINDEF) will have 2% budget cuts. MINDEF is the only one that have more budget this year. Now, defense budget accounts for about 30% of total govt budget. this is very high and there is so much that we can afford to spend.<br><br>i think RSAF should be glad that they have new &amp; expensive jets. Many civil servants are the one that have low morale as they have worry about smaller budgets, retrenchment &amp; outsourcing.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>The F15T is a good choice.<br><br>Economic of maintenance:<br>F15T will share a large number of standard spare parts with our current fleets of F16. The technical expertise gained in maintaining the F16 fleets could be applied on the F15T, thus reducing the lead time for our intregation of F15T into RSAF.<br><br>Blanket order of spare parts and standardization of critical components could be more readily available from USAF storage for us. Price of these spares could be cheaper. We could also get the scrapped F15A/B/C from US for our own "mod" as well (just like the A4 skyhawks). We could get the first 1 or 2 batches of brand new F15T, then followed by 30-40 mothballed F15A/B/Cs stored in US deserts with special technical modification done with the help from our friendly Nation X. This will enhance our technical capability, and will prove useful in building our next gen UCAV as our NGF in 20xx.<br><br>On surface, the Sukkoi fighter and Rafale deals looks more spectular. But this is only from surface. The Russians and French would not be willing to share with u the in-dpeth knowledge w/o your heavy investment. Sukkoi are not young, the Sukkoi is designed and built in late 1970s. But the special russian mod with Nation X equipments in Indian Sukkoi, has transformed the Su30MKI<br>into a deadly foe for any western planes. Rafale is a young planes currently only backed by France. The time &amp; cost factors could be very very high to develope the Rafale into a mature plane.<br><br>Operations:<br>While F15T is going to be a yesterday plane sooner or later, but the "mod" could enhance the lifespan of the F15T as well. We can expect to see a lot of "funny mod" in our F15Ts, possibly using the F15T together with UCAVs for ground supression missions. F15Ts heavy payload is good for carrying Stand-off weapons in RSAF for deep strike missions.<br><br>While Rafale would be used in junction with the French UCAVs in the future, F15T could be our local test platform. When the production line closes in states after 2010, we could get the equipments and blueprints in-house. In addition, we could also get the F15T engineering teams into Sg for our future projects (eg thrust vectoring F15S??, stealth F15S?? or ALCM F15S??). The French Rafale team is a great engineering teams, but we have more experience in working with our friends in states.<br><br>Finally, when coming to post modern air combat, the victor is always the side with the furthest reach and detection range. The AMRAAMs and Python4 would be the deadliest AAM in this era, expected to dominate well into next decade. Russian AAM are good, but the electronic miniaturization is way behind that of Nation X, let alone our friends in States. That is why the R77 electronic sensors are  bigger in size for similar performance envelope as the AMRAAMs.</div>

This is necessary to make the planes more agile, of course relying on advanced Fly-By-Wire systems.</div>
