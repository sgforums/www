            <div class='col-md body'>I dun think there is any official statement about it.<br><br><blockquote>MALAYSIA: A mid-2003 $RM5.4 billion ($1.42 billion) RMAF contract for 18 advanced two-seat multi-role Sukhoi Su-30MKMs is now known to include funding of 120 million ($143.56 million) for advanced digital mission<br><br>systems avionics from France's Thales group. The RMAF's Su-30MKMs will be similar to India's Su-30MKIs now arriving from Russia's Irkut group, with canards, <strong>thrust-vectored Lyulka AL-31FP turbofans </strong>and NIIP N-011M Bars radar. RMAF westernized mission systems avionics from Thales and SAGEM, however, will exclude Israeli Su-30MKI components in Su-30MKM and weapons package deliveries, due from 2006.<br><br>The RMAF will oversee integration of the aircraft and systems in Russia, which will be completed in partnership between Sukhoi and Thales. Equipped with modern European avionics, these aircraft will enhance the RMAF's already substantial combat aircraft fleet, from delivery by 2007 to 2008, while strengthening Thales' links with its Malaysian industrial partners. Thales claims that its systems will boost the capacity and operational performances of the SU 30MKMs, notably in the domains of avionics, navigation, identification and optronics, and enhance their capabilities for both day and night combat </blockquote>http://forum.keypublishing.co.uk/showthread.php?s=d56300b0f6c4fb7fd80c3e7665ad7b83&amp;t=30304<br><br></div>
