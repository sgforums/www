            <div class='col-md body'>last post for tonight... sleepy man...<br><br><blockquote>Malaysia Buys 18 Sukhois in RM3.4b Deal<br><br>KUALA LUMPUR, May 19 (2:22pm):  The Government today announced its purchase of 18 Russian-made Sukhoi Su-30MKM Flanker fighter jets for the Royal Malaysian Air Force, under a package deal worth US$900 million (RM3,42 billion).<br><br>Making the announcement, Defence Minister Datuk Seri Najib Tun Razak said that the deal proper would be made towards the yearÂ’s end, possibly during the proposed visit of Russian President Vladimir Putin.<br><br>Â“We have agreed in principle on the technical specifications of the aircraft and the financial aspects of the purchase," he told a packed Press conference at Wisma Pertahanan in Jalan Padang Tembak. "There are other formalities, including the direct and indirect offset packages, to be settled with."<br><br>Also present at the Press conference was NajibÂ’s Russian counterpart Sergey Ivanov who is on a three-day visit here.<br><br>The 18 jets, specially customised to Malaysian specifications (thus the Â“MKMÂ”), would be delivered the earliest by 2006.<br><br>Â“We selected the Su-30MKM because it fulfilled the RMAF's requirements of an advanced, multi-role combat aircraft to enhance its capabilities," he said. "The purchase is also part of RMAF's modernisation."<br><br>Najib said Russia would look into the possibility of helping RMAF upgrade its two squadrons of 18 MiG-29N, purchased in 1994.<br><br>Â“At the same time, we will also seek technical support from India, for both the MiGs and Sukhois, another major operator of the Russian jets,Â” he said.<br><br>Welcoming RussiaÂ’s cooperation to develop the countryÂ’s defence and anti-terrorism capabilities, Najib said there was avenue for Malaysia to exchange intelligence and information on these issues.<br><br>Malaysia is also expected to purchase a similar number of F/A-18E/F Super Hornets from Boeing of the United States.<br><br>Should both the Su-30MKM and Super Hornet deals materialise, it would make the RMAF one of the most modern outfits in the world.<br><br><span style="color: red;"> The Su-30MKM, an upgraded version of the Su-27, is powered by two AL-31F turbofan engines, designed by the Lyulka Engine Design Bureau (NPO Saturn). It could also be fitted with the AL-31FP engine with thrust-vectoring nozzles, just like those fitted to the MKI variants currently operated by the Indian Air Force.<br><br>The aircraft could be equipped with a 30mm GSh-301 gun with 150 rounds of ammunition and a range of missiles, rockets and bombs mounted externally on 14 hardpoints.<br><br>These include the air-to-air missiles carried by the aircraft includes: R-27R1 (NATO designation AA-10A Alamo-A), all-aspect medium-range missile with semi-active radar homing and R-27T1 (AA-10B Alamo-B) with infrared homing and a range from 0.5 to 60km; and R-73E (AA-11 Archer) all-aspect, close-combat air-to-air missile with infra-red homing and a range from 0.3 to 20km. </span><br><br>ItÂ’s systems include infrared search and track system, laser range-finder, radar, and helmet-mounted target designator provide detection, tracking and attack capability.<br><br>Ivanov said that his deputy Mikhail Dmitriev, who accompanied him, was leading a high-level military and technical delegation to iron out the finer details in the Sukhoi purchase programme for Malaysia.<br><br>Â“These include legalities, and terms and conditions on after-sales and support services to ensure the continued serviceability of the aircraft," he said.<br><br>Also to be discussed are the research and development, and transfer of technology facilities. The major purchase conditions were agreed upon by both parties.<br><br>Malaysia and Russia would, over the next few days, be involved in talks here on defence industry cooperation which includes trade of hardware, research and development, training and military exercises.<br><br>The aircraft purchase is a culmination of the visit by Prime Minister Datuk Seri Dr Mahathir Mohamad to Moscow several years ago, according to Ivanov.<br><br>The aircraft purchase package, although not large, is very significant for a long-term business partnership and other bilateral deals between both countries, including that of space technology.<br><br>Â“For Malaysia, I believe the purchase will attach great promise to develop the countryÂ’s economy, now that Malaysian-Russian trade is on the increase,Â” he said.<br><br>On RussiaÂ’s perception of the terrorist threat in Malaysia, Ivanov said Malaysia has a sound security and stable political climate that encouraged countries like Russia to do business here.<br><br>Â“I am satisfied with the current situation and convinced of the counter-terrorism efforts undertaken by your government," he said. "On our part, we are prepared to assist Malaysia in this aspect, including providing training and conducting joint military exercises."<br><br>One of the proposals was for the Royal Malaysian Navy to participate in joint exercises in the Indian Ocean where Russia has a large fleet presence.<br><br>Ivanov said Russia, along with China and several central Asian countries, had set up international anti-terrorism centres to that effect.(Source: The New Straits Times Online)<br></blockquote>it could be fitted with the AL-31FP... but its not... instead.. it is fitted with the AL-31F (NON VTC version)<br><br>weird... no R-77 mentioned....  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_question.gif" alt="Question" title="Question">  i thought they sure buy R-77 this time round?<br><br>oh... well... feel free to correct me if i am wrong...<br><br>but for now... my conclusion is...<br><br>1... no VTC..<br><br>2... if based on SU-27.. then probably no canards as well....<br><br>3... no R-77<br><br>good nite...</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Firstly, I feel that the main reason why the F-15 was selected was that it could fit its deep strike capability into the whole RSAF air umbrella and do so seamlessly.<br><br>With the Viper as our mainstay fighter, the F-15 will be meant for a much more highly specialised role.Think about it..</div>
