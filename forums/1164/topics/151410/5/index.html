Anyway dude, "Top Gun" style dogfight doesn't exist in 99.99% in the 21 century real world air combat conflict.<br></div></blockquote>Well, someone said this in the 1950's and it cumulated to the F4 Phantom... all bristling with Missiles and no guns.. the pilots lost their dog-fighting abilities and became missile drivers... They got wacked in Vietnam by the so-called "2nd rate" pilots of the Commie North and had to hurriedly start Top Gun to relearn all of the dog-fight skills again n install the M61 in the Phantom.( see Cunningham-Col Tomb classic encounter...)<br><br>Dog fights will always be encountered and the pilots had to be well trained in this classic skill... Of course if you can bush wack the other guy far away, all the better, but if it comes to knife fight range, you'd better hv your skills and the better aircraft ready... Never say Never...<br><br>In this same vein, I'd say the choice of the Mud Hen as our next fighter ( I see some subtle smoke being fired by the RSAF when they changed the program name from NGF (Next <strong>GENERATION</strong> Fighter program, to the NFRP (Next <strong>FIGHTER REPLACEMENT </strong>program), is a short term choice and this bird will not last the daylights in another 10-15 years when it gets too long in the tooth...<br><br>Altho' the insides can be upgraded often, it is always within the airframe and this design is already 30+ yrs old.. An airplane flies and how well it flies affects the survivablility and mission... Many are now going for low radar signature for  getting off the first shot and the Mud Hen will be a BIG FAT target... also, its manoeverability is past the best and will be beaten once the enemy gets into Archer range.. then What? Turn tail and run?? Too late then... Hope all of our vaunted air-battle tactics work or else we would be in deep doo-doo...<br><br>Checkl 6!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"></div>
