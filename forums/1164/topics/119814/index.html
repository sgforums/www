            <div class='col-md body'>Keppel Wins $73 Million Missile Radar Station For Pacific Ocean<br><br>SBX will consist of a large X-Band radar mounted on a modified fifth-generation semi-submersible platform with Battle Management Command Control and Communications, which will include In-flight Interceptor Communication System Data Terminals and associated communications; power generation; facility floor space; and infrastructure, similar to a fixed radar installation. The platform will be approximately 390 feet long, with a 238-foot beam, and an operations draft of approximately 75 feet. The height from water surface to the top of the radar dome will be 250 feet. The deck area will be approximately 270 x 230 feet.<br>Singapore - Oct 28, 2003<br>Singapore conglomerate Keppel Corp. said its US subsidiary AMFELS Inc. has won a 73 million US dollar defence-related contract from Boeing.<br>The contract involves outfitting a baredeck semi-submersible oil drilling platform that will be used as a radar outpost for the US government's missile defence system, Keppel said in a statement.<br><br>AMFELS' work also involves the construction of living quarters and installing of electrical, networking and mechanical systems on the platform.<br><br>When completed, the platform will be deployed in the Pacific Ocean to be used as an early detection facility for missiles fired from North Korea (news - web sites), the oil and gas publication Upstream said in a report this month.<br><br>The vessel is expected to be delivered in the first quarter of 2005.<br><br>"We are proud that Boeing Company has entrusted us with this project on account of our commitment to and reputation of on-time, on-budget delivery of superior quality projects without compromising health, safety and environment standards," AMFELS chairman Tong Chong Heong said.<br><br>Keppel's forte is in building jack-up rigs for the oil and gas industry and the reported contract for the sea-based radar outpost would be the first venture related to defence.<br><br>Boeing manufactures commercial and military aircraft as well as satellites. It is involved in aerospace activities, including missile defence systems and space flights.<br><br>The SBX Platform<br>The Missile Defense Agency (MDA) plans to conduct more operationally realistic testing of the Ground-Based Midcourse Defense (GMD) element of the overall Ballistic Missile Defense System (BMDS). Included as part of this test program is the development and construction of a Sea-Based X-Band Radar (SBX) that will track, discriminate, and assess incoming target missiles.<br><br>The SBX will provide enhanced capability to support more challenging test scenarios. By utilizing a floating platform, the X-Band radar can operate at the best location for different and varied test scenarios, whereas a fixed location for the X-Band radar would limit both performance potential and support to the GMD tests.<br><br>SBX will consist of a large X-Band radar mounted on a modified fifth-generation semi-submersible platform with Battle Management Command Control and Communications, which will include In-flight Interceptor Communication System Data Terminals and associated communications; power generation; facility floor space; and infrastructure, similar to a fixed radar installation.

The deck area will be approximately 270 x 230 feet.<br><br>The initial sea trials will take place in the Gulf of Mexico to ensure maneuverability and control of the vessel. In addition, the sea trials may include full power operation for satellite and calibration device tracking. Following the sea trials, the completed platform will transit from the Gulf of Mexico to its primary support base at Adak, Alaska.<br><br>SBX will perform tracking, discrimination, and assessment of target missiles in support of missile defense tests, as well as, operation of the GMD system.<br></div>
