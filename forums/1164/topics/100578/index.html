            <div class='col-md body'>I was wondering, is there any military novels that potray SAF in the correct manner? I've read a book written by a ex-USAF major called the last phenoix. The story is telling the arabs countries joined to take saudi arbia and china taking S.E.A . It find it laughable that the author called the SAF the SA( singapore army) and how the USVG (US volunteer group) a squadorn of A-10 the only major air cover we have. There is no mention of any SAF land force fighting and no mention of our F-5 and A-4. there is also very little mention of our  F-16 in comabt.<br><br>I want to ask , is there any good Singpaore military novels there???</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>There's none, even if you aren't harkening for a Tom Clancy-level parallel. Douglas Chia &amp; Wee Ee Hon ("Ko Island") are the only local writers I can think of whose recent publications dealt with some sort of SAF sensibility. There was also this NS account by an author whose name currently escapes me, with "Air Level" featured prominently in the title - will let you know on both tomorrow. Plus, I posted before that Mickey Chiang included an engagingly "realistic" short story that opened the SAF "Fighting Fit" coffee book of 1990.<br><br>IMO The best localized narratives - not necessarily fictional - are still those which depicted the Emergency Years. In particular, I recommend a couple: Noel Barber's "War of the Running Dogs" &amp;, my favorite, F. Spencer Chapman's "The Jungle Is Neutral". (Found $1 copies of both at a Bras Basah bookshop this year.) Of course, the SAF didn't exist then &amp; most of the dramatic action took place in the Malayan jungles.</div>

            </div>
            <div class='col-md body'>I enjoyed reading Wee Ee Hon's book, Ko Island: Will NS Men fight, but at the end of they day it comes off sounding a bit like propaganda rather then a true blue war story.<br><br>Still, I think it's a reasonably good short story. It's also not really realistic but it'll definitely please the patriot in you to hear about NS Men in combat and kicking ass! Not too bad for a first try for a local writing war fiction.<br><br>If you got cash to spare, support a fellow Singaporean.</div>

Wake up your idea.<br>Don't look down on yourself. It's a valid suggestion if you're game for it.<br><br>Afterall, anything's possible. Tom Clancy was an insurance broker who had never served any time in any armed service. At the time he wrote his first book "The Hunt for Red October", I don't think he'd even set foot on a Naval warship. The only things he knew were from books he read as a hobby.</div>

You don't really need a lot of knowledge of our military equipment and such as you can always dicredit whatever you write at the end of it. Anyway, I believe a lot of technologies are supposed to be classified info. Some authors scribble nonsense or rumours they heard. In some novels, their technology sounded futuristic but it actually exist in real life. Or maybe just make use of whiat you know of our SAF if you do not intend to go overboard (e.g SAR 21, F16C/D, F5T, LaFayatte Frigate, Apaches... ). Have anyone of you read Dan Brown's Deception Point. It made use of US's  NRO(National Reconnaisance Office), Delta Force and NASA. Brown described everything inside NRO and it's technology in a very concise manner. How could he have did it if NRO is a restricted place while the agents in there are told to keep their mouths shut.</div>
