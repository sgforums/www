            <div class='col-md body'>Joe Black, your answers:<br><br>- no idea<br><br>- no idea<br><br>- while it sounds like an interesting and exciting proposal, I wonder about it's feasibility. Unless we band together (maybe with Taiwan as well?)  and sponsor the project, it is almost certain the project will not go anywhere (US will want nothing of it as the USAF will view it as a threat to their F-35 program). Another issue is high risk vs low potential returns. The F-16 user air forces might also view it as a threat to their plans for buying JSF. IMO I wouldn't bother, get an interim type like RSAF and wait for the JSF.</div>

Should funding from the US side be cut, the whole program goes, no matter what the partners say.<br><br>Do not for a moment underestimate the politicians ability to cut programs. In a similar vein to the US not getting Block 60s so the USAF will claim to have a need for F-35s, consider:<br><br>- USMC electing out of SuperBug for F-35<br>- USAF opting out of Block 52+ and CFT-ed Vipers as they don't want to have long range Vipers (to back up their need for more and new tankers)<br><br>Defence funds for new projects is only that big in the US context, I can fully understand why the services want to cut off their noses in the short term for what they see as long term gain.</div>
