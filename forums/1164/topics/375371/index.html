              <p>lazy and lack of motivation is because you are preparing for war which will never happen. And if it really happen, the war will be over when a bomb drops on sg in which you may not even have the time to go and pick up your rifle.</p>

              <p>Just based on what you say above on how 1) you believe, despite your low IQ and lack of any institutional knowledge, Singapore is not susceptible to any military attack or provocation, 2) that Singapore will not win or is unable to hold off a military battle in the event 3) that Singapore is "finished" with "one bomb", and that "using one bomb" is the modus operandi of our enemies as opposed to conquering the land through Inf units.</p>

              <p>you're the uneducated whore who's exposed to be a 'man' in AA aren't you?</p>
              <p>Why don't you try to replace the population yourself? And you go support the ageing population on your own when you have one "so big fuck" LOCALLY BORN citizen supporting 10 people above 70 yr old in 20 years time, you fucktard. It's not your wet dream or Chee Soon Juan the retard's wanking fantasies. It's based on statistics from the life and birth registries you fucktard. Do it yourself you fuckwit. Next, try to repopulate the country by making the migrants do NS, you fucktard and I'd see how you can convince them short of spreading your arse.</p>
              <p>Didn't PM say that he'd make the migrants' kids do NS? Did your pimp granddaddy skip NS when he came here from China? Did your gigolo great-granduncle do NS too? If the Brits made your pimp daddy and gigolo uncle do NS, would they do it?</p>
              <p>How come you, their fucktard spawn had to do NS? I can see your small dick from here, like its not bad enough to be a faggot, we have to have retarded faggots as our "fellow citizens'.</p>
              <p>Fucking moron. The very reason why Singapore's progress would be held back. stupid people.</p>

In a nutshell, its 40% cheap labour, 40% to make up for man power and 20% for defence. Although the last 20% will not be used unless absolutely required.</p>
