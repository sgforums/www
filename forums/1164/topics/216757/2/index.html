            <div class='col-md body'>So does anyone think that our new submanes will have its hull extended like in the pic above? Personally don't think it is necessary as our waters are shallow and our operational area is not that big. So having a small sub actually is an advantage.<br><br>But then again, having a large submarine generally means more weapons and more endurance so it also not bad. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I guess if it's lengthening, it will be for extra battery capacity(assuming lead acid type). But I've come across some technology on the web that's 3 to 4 times more energy density. More expensive though. May not be so in the near future.<br><br>May I ask the more knowledgeable forumers whether flow batteries are a better alternative than some AIPs that doesn't use diesel and other fuels  etc?</div>

But will that post a problem to maneuvorbility especially in the busy, shallow waters littered with wrecks around Singapore, after all the submarine is designed for the Swedish waters and not ours.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"></div>
