            <div class='col-md body'>I think why people now dun use flamethrower is bcos it is definitely considered to be obsolete. Traditionally, flamethrowers are used to assault hard target like bunkers, concrete pillboxes. In FIBUA, they are used to weed out or kill enemy forces hidden in areas where normal infantries can't reach or areas the enemies can hide from grenades or rounds. Now a days, to perform these task is a simple comms to the 84RR PS, and the target can be easily cleared with HE rounds.<br>If u use flamethrowers, the range is limited, and u got to inch slowly and carefully to the target. U may need a platoon size force to pin down the enemies from firing their MGs. Thus casualties are definitely high.<br><br>Wad I want SAF to get is the TOS-1 system from Russia. It is a short range 230mm MLRS which is thermobaric in nature. It is used successfully against the Chechen Rebels in Russia.<br><br>Wad interest me is that the flamethrower seems to be still in use in China. The 97 military exercise shows a flamethrower clearing a trench. They even seem to have vocations like flag carriers and trumpeter.........LOL</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>Effects of thermobaric weapon</strong><br><br><blockquote>In a thermobaric weapon, the fuel consists of a monopropellant and energetic particles. The monopropellant detonates in a manner simular to TNT while the particles burn rapidly in the surrounding air later in time, resulting an intense fireball and high blast overpressure. The term "thermobaric" is derived from the effects of temperature,the Greek word "therme" means "heat",and pressure,the Greek word "baros" means "pressure",on the target. The ability of thermobaric weapons to provide massed heat and pressure effects at a single point in time cannot be reproduced by conventional weapons without massive collateral destruction.<br><br>The initial detonation reaction defines the systemÂ’s high pressure performance characteristics: armour penetrating ability.<br><br>The post detonation anaerobic reaction define the systemÂ’s intermediate pressure performance characteristics: Wall/Bunker Breaching Capability.<br><br>The post detonation aerobic reaction characteristics define the systemÂ’s personnel / material defeat capability: Impulse and Thermal Delivery.<br><br>Aerobic combustion requires mixing with sufficient air to combust excess<br>fuels. The shock wave pressures are less than 10 atmospheres. The majority of aerobic combustion energy is available as heat. Some low pressure shock wave enhancement can also be expected for personnel defeat. Personnel / material defeat with minimum collateral structure damage requires maximum aerobic enhancement  </blockquote>Good against armour? Infantry? MOUT sounds good<br><br><img src="http://naoruzanje.paracin.co.yu/rpo1.jpg"><br><br><strong>RPO-A Shmel</strong><br><blockquote>RPO-A Shmel, the initial version was termed a capsule flame-thrower and relied upon its incendiary and blast capabilities for on-target effects. A later version combines the thermobaric warhead with a small hollow charge which penetrates light armour or structures to allow the main warhead to detonate inside a target, thereby considerably enhancing the projectile's destructive effects.<br>The effect of the RPO-A projectile is such, that when detonated inside a structure, its lethal and destructive effects will cover an area of 80 m3, claimed to be similar to an equivalent 122 mm artillery projectile. When utilised against personnel in the open the lethal area will cover 50 m2. Maximum range is 1,000 m but the sights are calibrated to only 600 m. Point blank range against a target 3 m high is 200 m.</blockquote></div>
