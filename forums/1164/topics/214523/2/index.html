            <div class='col-md body'>During the lesson in BMT, the instructors told us that the WP substance that is spewed out sticks to the skin and keeps burning until there's a hole into the flesh and apparently cannot be washed off with water and has to burn itself out.<br><br>The WP canister grenade looked like a smoke grenade, so it can be easily confused with a true smoke grenade especially at night inside the forest when you can't see anything. Other than its nasty effect, this must also be a concern for widespread issue.<br><br>Ordinary smoke grenades for signal or cover must be made of things other than WP. For one, they do not burst but just sprays out the smoke.<br><br>However, I think that if you throw a WP at the enemy, it has the double effect of burning them as well as producing smoke to obscure their vision or mark their position for airstrike etc.<br><br>So maybe WP arty shells are fired at the enemy for the same dual purpose. If the enemies under WP attack can't see, they can't shoot. And those that got burnt would be screaming and causing a lot of distress.<br><br>US recently began using WP against insurgents in Iraq. Signs of desperation.<br><br>In Korea, the US used WP. The PLA feared it tremendously. They released some captured US POW with the message that should the any US trooper be captured with WP, the PLA will use it on him.</div>
