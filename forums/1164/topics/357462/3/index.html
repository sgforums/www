              "Key infrastructure, including power stations, have become vulnerable due to their dependence on Internet connections,"
                  
              "It would take two years and cost less than $50 million a year to prepare a cyberattack that could paralyze the United States," 
              
              On the other hand, cyber warriors think Darpa too slow...

              Interesting cos cyber attacks are already happening.
              
              In peacetime, cyber attacks can result in critical information loss. Besides schematics, it includes logistics, practices, SOPs etc. All of which represent info that can be used in war.
              
              The 1967 six day war is an example of utilising organisational data. The israelis knew egyptian pilots tend to sleep through a certain time. Hence attack was at that time.
              
              Cyber warfare can generate opportunities for such exploitation on a different vector.

              <p>Just a few thoughts......</p>
              <p>Data defence could easily be deployed by implanting false informations. So a successful extraction of information would still need to verify the data. Ground intel is needed.</p>
              <p>A  PRC NGO lead cyber attack would result as a portal it could easily do a reverse mapping of the intel network. almost the same case as a Terrorist cell that is identified but would still monitors information and plans rather than take out the cell.</p>
              <p>Cyber attack has open up hostilty "Intend" from the chinese side against the US to undertake cyber defence.</p>

              <p>Cyber snoops launch recruitment drive<br>Posted Mon Aug 2, 2010 4:00pm</p>
              <p>A secretive and elite United States cyber team that has tracked criminals on the internet for more than 10 years has used this year's DefCon hackers conference to recruit new members.</p>
              <p>The chief of the normally secretive team, Chet Uber, described Vigilant as a cyber "A-Team", taking on terrorists, drug cartels, mobsters and other enemies on the internet.</p>
              <p>"We do things the government can't," Mr Uber said.</p>
              <p>"This was never supposed to have been a public thing."</p>
              <p>Vigilant is an alliance of slightly more than 600 volunteers and its secret ranks reportedly include chiefs of technology at top firms and former high-ranking US cyber spies.</p>
              <p>The group scours internet traffic for clues about online attacks, terrorists, cartels and other targets rated as priorities by members of the democratically run private organisation.</p>
              <p>Vigilant also claimed to have "collection officers" in 22 countries that gather intelligence or coordinate networks in person.</p>
              <p>"We go into bars, look for lists of bad actors, get tips from people," Mr Uber said.</p>
              <p>"But a significant amount of our intelligence comes from our monitoring the internet.</p>
              <p>"We are looking at everything on websites, and websites are public."</p>
              <p>Mr Uber says the team shares significant findings with US spy agencies and is so respected by leading members of the hacker community that he was invited to DefCon to recruit new talent.</p>
              <p>He says Vigilant came up from underground after 14 years of operation in a drive to be at "full capacity" by adding 1,750 "vetted volunteers" by the year 2012.</p>
              <p>"We are good people not out to hurt anybody," Mr Uber said.</p>
              <p>"Our one oath is to defend the US Constitution against all enemies foreign and domestic."</p>
              <p>Anything that can be looked at legally on the internet is fair game for Vigilant, with email and encrypted transactions such as online shopping off limits.</p>
              <p>Mr Uber says his team uncovered evidence of fraud in the latest presidential election in Iran and has been testing a way for people to slip information out of countries with oppressive regimes.</p>
              <p>He says the information obtained was given to US officials.</p>
              <p>"They expected fraud but they didn't expect the wholesale fraud that we passed along," he said.</p>
              <p>The holy grail for Vigilant is finding out who is behind cyber attacks.</p>
              <p>Inability to figure out who launches online assaults routinely leaves companies or governments without targets to fire back at.</p>
              <p>"This is a completely unsolved problem," Mr Uber said.</p>
              <p>"We've probably been working on it as long as the government has." - AFP</p>

              <p>The key in winning a cyber warfare is SPEED!</p>
              <p>The Chinese is 1 up against the US and the rest of the world with their advanced Super Computer.</p>
              <p>Chinese supercomputer named world's fastest  <br>Mon, Nov 15, 2010<br>AFP  <br>   <br>BEIJING - <strong>China overtook the United States at the head of the world of supercomputing on Sunday when a survey ranked one of its machines the fastest on the planet.</strong></p>
              <p>Tianhe-1, meaning Milky Way, achieved a computing speed of 2,570 trillion calculations per second, earning it the number one spot in the Top 500 (<a href="http://www.top500.org">www.top500.org</a>) survey of supercomputers.</p>
              <p>The Jaguar computer at a US government facility in Tennessee, which had held the top spot, was ranked second with a speed of 1,750 trillion calculations per second.<br> <br>Tianhe-1 does its warp-speed "thinking" at the National Centre for Supercomputing in the northern port city of Tianjin - using mostly chips designed by US companies.</p>
              <p>Another Chinese system, the Nebulae machine at the National Supercomputing Centre in the southern city of Shenzhen, came in third.</p>
              <p>The United States still dominates, with more than half of the entries in the Top 500 list, but China now boasts 42 systems in the rankings, putting it ahead of Japan, France, Germany and Britain.</p>
              <p>It is not the first time that the United States has had its digital crown stolen by an Asian upstart.</p>
              <p>In 2002, Japan made a machine with more power than the top 20 American computers put together.</p>
              <p>The supercomputers on the Top 500 list, which is produced twice a year, are rated based on speed of performance in a benchmark test by experts from Germany and the United States.</p>

              <p>If a malaysian can hack into US Fed, how much more can the PRC hackers do?</p>
              <p>M'sian hacked into US Fed</p>
              <p>NEW YORK - A SOPHISTICATED Malaysian cyber bandit hacked into the US Federal Reserve's computers and also stole nearly half a million credit and debit card numbers, US prosecutors in New York said.</p>
              <p>Lin Mun Poo, a Malaysian resident and citizen, was arrested on October 21 soon after entering the United States and was indicted by grand jury on Thursday, the US attorney's office in Brooklyn said.</p>
              <p>He allegedly hacked into the Cleveland, Ohio branch of the Fed, the US central bank, and in separate attacks also stole more than 400,000 card numbers, as well as breaching the defences of numerous other systems.</p>
              <p>Poo, who is being held in pre-trial detention, 'made a career of compromising computer servers belonging to financial institutions, defence contractors, and major corporations, among others, and selling or trading the information,' the US attorney's office said.</p>
              <p>'Secret Service agents seized his heavily encrypted laptop computer, which contained a massive quantity of financial account data and personal identifying information that he had allegedly obtained by hacking,' the prosecutor's office said.</p>
              <p>Among the other alleged hacking by Poo, the Secret Service said he entered a Pentagon contractor's system 'potentially compromising highly sensitive military logistics information.' -- AFP</p>
