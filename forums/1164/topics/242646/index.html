            <div class='col-md body'>Please read this book. Very insightful, also very alarming. It is another "Vietnam" coming to a country near you.<br><br><img src="http://ec2.images-amazon.com/images/P/174051209X.01-A35MNAZ77Y26Q7._AA160_SCLZZZZZZZ_.jpg"><br><br>The situation is actually quite serious and though there is a general news blackout, Singapore is already somehow involved.<br><br>Some of the rebels were exiled to SIngapore and later moved to Sweden.<br><br>These people have been fighting before the birth of modern Indonesia. They fought the Dutch, the Japs, the Dutch again. When Indonesia became independent, the Acehnese were betrayed and they began fighting the Indonesians.<br><br>Besides independence for Aceh, the bigger cause they are fighting for is to make Indonesia an Islamic Republic - as opposed to a democratic republic. They have big ambitions.<br><br>This Islamisation is gaining momemtum all over Indonesia.<br><br>Why Aceh is important for us to understand is that although there is a news blackout, this place looks like the most potentially troublesome place eventually for SE Asia.<br><br>It is not difficult to imagine JI finding lots of willing converts in Aceh.<br><br>Ever wondered why Singapore responded so generously to the Acehnese?<br><br>Could it be because we want to be buy some goodwill from a potentially explosive population?<br><br>The Indonesian military had been killing indiscrimately and all kinds of abuses heaped upon the Acehnese. Not difficult to predict that the war will increase beyond Aceh's borders as the Acehnese start bring the war to the Indonesians.<br><br>Now there is only one or two organisations like GAM that's fighting the Indos. It's a matter of time before more extremist factions emerge.<br><br>The loss of E Timor in the extreme east of their empire surely puts the Indos in no mood to lose yet another chunk in their western most.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>GAM has effectively ended its armed revolt and disarmed itself after the peace accords signed in 2005 under the auspices of the Norwegian government. Former guerrillas were integrated back into society. Free elections were held in Acheh this year and GAM is participating politically in the electoral system. The central government in Jakarta has also made inroads towards greater allocation of Achehnese oil revenues to local needs. Hence the Acheh rebellion is in the past tense.</div>

Consequently, it may be easier to invest in such a region, because they have more control over their natural resources too.<br><br>Furthermore, the Acehnese have always been at odds with the Javanese, same as the case of Timor Leste, which apart from Indonesian annexation in the 70s, did not share a single culture nor ethnic history with the ruling elites in Java.</div>

However, I foresee greater autonomy and nothing further than that. Both the provinces and the central government need each other. If Aceh did not get anything more than autonomy, I don't think the other provinces would get a better deal than a larger share of the oil/gas revenue.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz"></div>
