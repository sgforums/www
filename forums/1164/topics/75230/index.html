            <div class='col-md body'>Don't forget Sandline International, a British company and a very big player in 'privatised warfare'. Widely suspected of involvement in major illegal arms trading, often in violation of United Nations sanctions.<br><br>These companies can serve a useful role if properly regulated; for example, politically sensitive UN peacekeeping missions can be 'outsourced' to them quite economically.<br><br>The problem is, though, there is very little regulation right now to prevent these companies from running amok. Their bosses behave like feudal warlords, brazenly interfering in civil wars and genocidal conflicts in order to make a quick buck. They have plundered and pillaged many of the mineral rich parts of Africa, setting up a flourishing international trade in everything from conflict diamonds to illegally poached ivory tusks.<br><br>Many of these companies that routinely violate humanitarian law and essentially profit from the blood of innocents are British in origin. One wonders why the British government doesn't police them more rigorously, but I suppose the Brits (even though they loudly proclaim themselves as champions of human rights) have frequently shown that they have no qualms about shedding innocent blood in order to generate profits for their arms industry.<br><br>For example, they sold Hawk fighter-bombers to the Suharto regime, which was still merrily slaughtering East Timorese at the time. The Sandhurst military academy and Oxford University have trained more third world dictators than any other institution in the world, and most of these dictators have then gone on to place large orders for British military equipment. I think Margaret Thatcher's own son is a director of Sandline. The list goes on.</div>

This policy has also had the additional objective of Anglicising foreign leaders (and often, sons / daughters of leaders) and making them sympathetic to British interests.<br><br>You'll notice that a disproportionate number of third world dictators (and their assorted offspring and cronies) with a Western education have been educated in the UK rather than the US. Bashar al-Assad, who's widely suspected of supporting international terrorism, was a student at Oxford just a few years ago. Benazir Bhutto was President of the Oxford Union. Etc etc etc ad nauseam.<br><br>As for Sandhurst, that's even worse - that's a military school that provides its students with training in extremely potent techniques that can be employed as tools of oppression. Its intake is directly supervised by the Ministry of Defence. Yet, so many third world tinpot republic strong men have managed to find their way into the academy, and have used (and continue to use) their acquired military skills to maintain a stranglehold over their people.<br><br>I'm not sure about your School of the Americas claim - the US did support quite a number of Latin American regimes, but often felt constrained to do so covertly (recall the Iran-Contra scandal, for example). That precluded the US from actually accepting foreign dictators into its universities (where they would probably be lynched on arrival) or supplying them with American arms. Quite often, while the US supplied these regimes with funding, they were required to buy Soviet-made weapons on the black market to hide the fact that their support came from the US.<br><br>It's different, you see - while the US supported dictators for strictly political ends, the UK did so for politics as well as to simply drive its arms industry.<br><br>Also, even if the US did provide actual training to the Latin American strongmen, I think that, going by the numbers, the Brits still beat their record for the sheer numbers of dictators they educated / trained.<br><br></div>
