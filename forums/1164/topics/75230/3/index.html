Do NOT attempt to misrepresent my position.<br><br>And as I had already clearly explained before, these institutions did NOT train these dictators to <span style="font-style: italic;">be</span> dictators. As you say, they were trained at these institutions and became dictators afterwards. I'm NOT saying that they sat through their Oxford Law or PPE supervisions with their tutors telling them, "Have you thought about what you're going to do after university? I hear being a dictator's a pretty good job! Here, take an application form!" My sole contention here is that these institutions have an inenviable track record of having had dictators and tyrants among their students. There is also an entirely reasonable supposition here that these people put the skills and knowledge they acquired at Oxford / Sandhurst to deadly use when they returned to their home countries and commenced their misrule.

How can you possibly assume that their education had no effect whatsoever in making them more inclined towards dictatorship? How can you so readily conclude that, for example, Benazir Bhutto's presidency of the Oxford Union and her consequent interaction with English aristocracy (who, to this day, still have ideas about how societies should only be ruled by certain people with certain social / genealogical backgrounds) did not strengthen or indeed provoke her development of her own ideas about how she was entitled to rule and exploit Pakistan for her own benefit?<br><br>Sure, the climate in their own countries plays a significant part too, but you can't rule out the effect of education. I thought it would have been blindingly obvious to Singaporeans in particular that education has a profound effect on how people behave towards their fellow men and women long after they graduate (cf. the whole Raffles - PAP connection).<br><br>As for Sandhurst, you point out that many military academies have "exchange programmes".

HOW could anyone have known?<br><br>it is still not obvious to me from your questionable line of argument that oxford happily and wilfully accepted students of a questionable character and equipped them for nasty ends.<br><br><blockquote>Furthermore, there is no such thing as monocausation in life, and the same rule applies to politics.
