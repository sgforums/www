            <div class='col-md body'>Why decide to sign on right now ? It's a rather big decision and you all haven't even went through army life yet. It's not all guts and glory like in the movies. I had toyed with that idea before i went into NS, now I'm glad i didn't sign on. Simply because outfield life isn't exactly as what I had pictured before i entered. It wasn't all "go go go !!! " or "storm the front !!!" or "chiong ah !!!" ala CS and all the war movies.<br><br>There was the mosquitoes bites that were so numerous i'd think the bites i suffered in the army alone numbers in thousands. Then there was the long tactical marches, and most of all the digging (i can be a part time farmer liao with all my experience). And there's all the regimentation and politics b/w the appointment holders, and b/w NSF/regulars. I swear it's almost like your average office politics in a commercial company.<br><br>In any case, I was a spec in the infantry, and a lot of my spec frens signed on through SAFEC (now non-existant) for 10 years. 9 out of 10 want to break the bond after the 5 year mark. The 5 year mark is the earliest point in the contract where you can break the contract without having to pay back any money.<br><br>My advice, try the life. If you like it, then sign on. If you don't, you just saved yourself from the jaws of the SAF. If you're thinking about the money, you get backpay up to 6 months from the day you sign on. So no loss if you sign <strong>after</strong> you enter NS.<br><br>Anyway how to get selected for OCS ?<br><br>The computer test in CMPB is very important. If you didn't sign on, this will probably determine your vocation and rank in the SAF, along with your PES status. If you wanna go garang places like cdo/guards/infantry, choose the garang answers. Eg :<br><br>I would rather :<br>a) read a book<br>b) climb a mountain<br>c) go sky diving<br><br>I chose (b). Look where it got me. Infantry. For guards I would guess you have to be good in swimming too, so state you can swim 50 laps in the super long form to ask you to fill.<br><br>I would say the stupid computer test determines 95% of all NSF vocations. I've seen good soldiers become men, and cockanadens become officahs. So do the test properly. All those interviews, surveys, and peer appraisals in BMT are rubbish and probably end up as a statisic on some general's table. So unless you are :<br><br>a)really outstanding and extremely fit, or<br>b)the complete opposite of (a)<br><br>Your NSF fate is solely determined by that CMPB computer test.<br><br>In any case, I wouldn't say JC students have a higher chance of going into OCS. Because JC and poly students basically have different intake timings. JC peeps usually enlist in the first half of the year, poly peeps in the 2nd half. Officer selection is mostly independant of each other. You're not going to compete with the other JC/poly people, just within your own batch.</div>

They all follow strict "time-tables", meaning they spend fixed times at one position before they move on. If you're the sort keen on adventure and want the "glamour" of being a leader in battle, it's better if you stay NSF or be a specialist instead. You only get to do the adventure bit for max 1.5 years, after that, if you're unlucky you end up as a ranking "clerk" in one of the HQs, doing plenty of paper work and secretary jobs.<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by kY|e-_-o:</div><div class="quote_body">my first choice would be intelligence..<br>go to ocs and apply to be an intelligence officer.. if i manage to make it to ocs that is.. try my best  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"> </div></blockquote>FYI, for people aiming for anything higher than LTC, they must be government scholarship material and even then, it's no garauntee you will make it so far. Personally, I won't recommend joining IO before you actually get a feel of it. My CO tried to convince me to convert when I decided not to continue with my contract but the scheme was quite new and the route of advancement was real murky for the junior officers so you might end up hanta kaki on one position for longer than expected. Shit happens.<br><br>So think carefully. I was lucky enough to see both the good and bad sides and I got out before shit happened.</div>
