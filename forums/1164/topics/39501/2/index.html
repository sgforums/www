An air superiority fighter? OR a bomb hauler which also happens to be able to shoot respectably at other things in the sky ?  If the bomb hauler is what we want, then ok fine, get the F-15T, but if we want air superiority, I'd rather something more up to date, and later spend a bit more on the missiles ourselves. . . its only about 24 planes, we can't afford to have them falling out of the sky!!  esp. if they are for air superiority!</div>

And singapore alone has over 100+ military aircraft, I don't think we ever need worry abt spare-parts<br><br>Also It's all a matter of economics. When there is no war, toys like these cost a huge bomb. Everytime you fly an F-16 you burn USD2500 and the parts or wiring needs to be replaced or serviced.<br><br>Think of it as the workstations/servers in your company environment or school.<br><br>If you buy from one particular vendor say Sun 100 unix boxes, if you had to upgrade each one of them to 1GB main memory each do you think you will get a better deal from Sun? Do you think you can twist their arm to get them to lower their price or get more freebie, if you had a problem you cannot solve do you think you able to squeeze their balls to get them to help you based on the fact that you have a huge sun server environment thus a big customer?<br><br>Say you bought 30 sun servers, 30 HP and 30 IBM, do you think you can twist each of their arms sufficiently, more likely they will tell you to go to hell!<br><br></div>

Singapore not known to pay good money for junk.</div></blockquote>Oh , u shd be in the force to know that all the JSF stuff were bribes , maybe that is too dangerous for u to say it in a public forum arent u.<br><br>About the missile , u shd know that the R-77 out range the Amraam and i believe the Derby . However specs of missile offered is one thing , the technology and era of aircraft offered is another. Are u trying to tell mi , we will buy a late 80 upgraded by yet vintage aircraft to match the growing air threat in the region??? No i dun think so its wise to do that. Are we going to buy a plane whereby the Americans are replacing and the British are not adoping to fight our growing threat???<br><br>Look here , everyone will know that the Su-30 , Rafale and Typhoon do provide new technology such as high end sensor , agility and weaponary which the F-15 dun have or the Americans do not want to offer. For wat u are saying , are we going to buy a plane whereby our neighbour's SU is build to kill???<br><br>However yes , no doubt the F-15 is old , it still provide a punch but is it wise to buy something whereby its out dating in the world arena , and similar Amraam incident might occur again??? Then like that  , we are not learning from our mistakes.<br><br>I disagree that the Typhoon is junk , every warplane will meet error in development , go check out how many Mudhen had crash , does it mean that the Mudhen is junk?? If the Typhoon is junk , then i shd say in regret that the RAF have choose a junk plane rather than choosing the F-15s whereby they had test it out in Kosovo and friendly exchanges between their American counterparts.<br><br>Cheers <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink">  Think out of the boX.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>the koerans radar is in v1 therefore can b upgraded to v3 near future which is possible, ours on the other hand is selected v3 radar as the proposal, would b diffcult to have another level of upgrade unless ST upgrade the eagles locally, to another level of AESA radar.  as for f-15active, the demostrator plane, i would b surprise if ST Aero upgraded the F-15T (selected IF) to part active(wif carnards) with/or tvc engine to counter the Su-30MKM.</div>
