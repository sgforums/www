However, what about our current fleet of Vipers? The oldest one the A/Bs are coming close to 15 years. What is RSAF going to do with them? I often wonder why not to upgrade them to the MLU/Block 50 standard so that we can better service them? The oldest of the C/D Vipers will also be nearly a decade old in another 2 years time.  Should we also look at giving them a minor upgrade, eg. radar to the same APG-68V(5), color LCD displays plus any other upgrades that are found in the latest batch of Vipers RSAF is receiving.<br><br>As for the next fighter purchase, my point of view still stands at that we should buy a non-US made aircraft given Singapore is most likely to commit to a JSF purchase. Singapore needs to leverage our unique position (especially at this time) to get the "best" ***operational*** fighter with a good weapon package to boot. That means Rafale currently presents the best option IMO. Otherwise, we may as well settle for Super bugs or F-15T and integrate them with Standoff weapons from Israel. We could also demand JDAMs and Slammer along with the packages.<br></div></blockquote>i read from AFM last yr March issue , the chief of rsaf says the Falcon ONE is just a demostrator for the viper A/B in regards to Man-machine interface, so most probably we would not upgrade the A/Bs Viper as we had most of the C/D variants to replace the A-4SU for now in the strike role.<br><br>I guess most probably we be selling the A/Bs Vipers or as the Black Knight team demostrator.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>In fact, Mindef has also developed its own upgrade of the F-16A/B which they call F-16TD(or something like that). According to MINDEF, it is just only a technology demonstrator for the man-machine interface thingy. One such upgrade was appiled to a  RSAF F-16A and was displayed at Asian Aerospace 2002.<br><br>This leaves only 5 F-16A/B(one crashed and one upgraded). RSAF should either relegate these F-16A/B to acrobatic duties or use them in aggessor training. In addition, they can also give one F-16 to ST aero to build a Falon One prototype.<br><br>I think RSAF has  upgraded its older F-16C/D to colour MFD configuration as according to an Australian magazine, RSAF has purchased colour MFDs from Honeywell.<br><br></div>
