Dislike Malaysia? Sorry, but I respectfully disagree. I have Malaysian friends and last I checked I had no problems with them at all. My problem is with those windbags on both sides of the Causeway who manipulate the feelings of both Singaporeans and Malaysians for cheap political points and those same windbags who shoot their mouth off and end up shooting themselves in the foot.<br><br>A check of the posts I made here and in the Speakers Corner would vindicate that fact.<br><br>And if you feel that the points I've raised were false in any way, please kindly explain why.

Technically , viper isnt wrong by saying that. Let drop the case and not drag another malaysian issue in.<br></div>

It is extremely difficult to fly those 2 types of planes in a single team, and I believe its the first time that any aerobatic team used 2 completely different and extreme mix of aircraft. It goes to show the skill needed to even maintain a simple formation. In fact during AA2000, amongst the pilots which I had a chance to speak to, they were quite   impressed with the skills of the Black Knights.</div>

They sometimes read what we post here, and discuss it on their on forum. But it will have to be on "friendly prices".</div>
