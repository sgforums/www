I think this is a joke.<br><br>The fighter is going to replace our A-4SU , thus logic will tell u that the next fighter will be the cream of ATG. The F-15E/k/T do give a reasonable punch ,however will US release the equippment for us for that punch....? No , i dun think so. The next fighter i can think so which can Mud move is the Typhoon. A typical stike mission with 18 Brimstone , 4 Amraam and 2 Asraam can deliver hell to our enemy. Y not a mission with 2 storm shadows , 4 Amraam and 2 Asraam??? We can penerate Kuala Lumpur and Jakarta<br><br>My logic is not abt specs , but is that if we buy any fighter outside US ( maybe Rafale or SU-30 ) we are entitled to weapons classes which US will not be game to sell. Combat proven is not an important issue. Rafale and SU-30 isnt realli combat proven doesnt mean they are inferior to the F-15 because they havent have a fighting chance to prove themselves.<br><br>One havent have the chance to prove themselve , doesnt mean they dun have the capability to exel.

            <div class='col-md body'>Foxtrout8, the source is the official website of Typhoon, I won't read too much into it. I am not saying Typhoon is not a good ATG platform, its just that it is not maximised for that capability as well as other fighters, namely F-16 and Rafale. The Typhoon "block" model as of now does not have a very good ATG suite and capability. Like I said, the block upgrade for the ATG will come later in the development cycle. When that will happen is anybody's guess. Until then I won't put Typhoon as "leading" in the ATG role.</div>
