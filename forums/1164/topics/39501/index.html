And dun forget. . . we need tons of other equipment .. . compatibility issues, esp. the Su-30MK.. .<br><br>anyway, I think the Rafale rox. . .  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"> but only Su-30MK has TVE. . ., dammit. . .<br><br>stats of Typhoon look nice. . . but i dun like the look of the typhoon. . . sorry. .  i judge a book by its cover. . .<br><br>Rafale also requires less than 1300 ft (less than 400m) of runway for takeoff and landing<br><br>Typhoon needs 700m<br><br>Su-30MKI (India's version) needs 550m for takeoff and 670 for landing. . .<br><br>http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/world/russia/su-30mk.htm<br>read the last paragraph:<br>"In May 2002 it was reported that studies in a Boeing simulator complex show that the Su-30MK can defeat an F-15C Â“every timeÂ” by using a combination beyond visual range (BVR) attack with an AA-12, followed by a close approach and attack with an IR-guided AA-11. The Su-30 penetrates the F-15Â’s Doppler radar net because it can rapidly dump speed to zero relative to the F-15, then attack from below and accelerate away. Similar tactics, say the analysts, would not work against an F-22 or F-35. The maneuver also requires great pilot skill, of a level very rare outside leading Western powers. It is also possible that the test is set up to justify purchase of the F-22 and F-35 along with various new air-to-air missiles. Critics point out that the maneuver will also not work against the F-16 and F-18, since with their smaller radar signatures they are not so vulnerable to the BVR portion of the attack.
