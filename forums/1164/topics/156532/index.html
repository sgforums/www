            <div class='col-md body'>i read from some book that our current subs can operate with onli 18 crew as compared to other subs like agosta which needs 54 crew, is it true that such a small crew can operate a more complicated vessel as compared to surface warships?btw the vastergotland class subs need a crew of 28 onli,from wad i saw on the book.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>If our submarines can really operate with such a small crew this comes to show something...The original submarines have been heavily modified internally and i am not refering to the tropicalisation process. The highly automated operations means we can react as fast if not faster than a conventionally crewed sub. To be able to operate with such a small crew means that we can operate more submarines with our current small supply of manpower and thus the 2 additional submarines bought recently.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"></div>

With the sub HMS Halland of Gotland class) did make the Americans interested but it wasn't <span style="color: red;">until a Singaporian Swedish-trained, and equipped with a Swedish sub (altho actually not of Gotland class) penetrated the defense of a U.S CVN that the bells really rang over there... for the first time, a submarine stood ready to fire its torpedoes against a US nuclear aircraft carrier</span>.<br><br><strong>Originally posted by IAF in militaryposts.net:</strong><br>Hi signatory, this is interesting... Are you refering to ex-sjoormens? Would you be kind enough to elaborate?<br><br><strong>Originally posted by signatory in militaryposts.net:</strong><br><span style="color: red;">yeah.. unfortunately I don't know which one of the subs from 'Project Riken' took part in that exercise but yes ex-sjÃ¶ormen class. Of course project Riken ment 6 years of upgrades with the last of the 4 subs delivered in 2001. Training of crews, engineers and sharing of documentation were also part of that project.</span><br></blockquote>Since we dunno how much the 4 Challenger class boats cost but I am sure quite cheap( jsut look at the cost of 2 VÃ¤stergÃ¶tland ), it is good platform for us to learn and gain experience for submarines operation, just look at above example , is it more than worth it!!!!<br><br>If the Challenger could penetrate USN CVN grp, it certainly could do so against any navy in the world!!! Afterall who is better than USN!!!!<br><br>Next the 2 upgraded AIP VÃ¤stergÃ¶tland-class submarines only cost us USD128mils, which mean only USD64mils per boats!!!! <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"><br><br>Do you know how much one brand new AIP SSK cost???<br><br>It is abt USD350~400mils per boat , more toward USD400mils!!!!<br><br>Do you know that MY bought 2 non-AIP Scorpene plus one old Agosta given to them free cost them????<br><br>USD972mils!!!! <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br>That is why I said you dunno what the hell you are talking abt!!!! <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"></div>

There are times when the CV transits and has a mere 2 or 3 escorts.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Erm, it true that a carrier battle group doesn't sail without it escorts.

But just to quote urself in that particular thread.<br><br><blockquote>It was meant to be an ASW exercise.....they were out hunting for us.....from ASW helos, P-3C Orion, Sonobouy, frigate, cruiser.....wonder if satelite was involved in tracking us....anyway left the navy liao...</blockquote>No mention of US SSNs.<br><br>I've always believed that the best weapon to hunt another submarine, is another submarine.  Hence my posts was simply that, the "swedish" team had a good chance cos of the possible absence of a US boat.<br><br>However, I still retain the respect for the crew of the RSN boat that managed to penetrate US ASW lines, and obtain a firing solution on a US Carrier.</div>
