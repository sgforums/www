            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by specfore:</div><div class="quote_body">Accuracy of the M16...  this was probably the more significant fault compared to other assault rifles.  The M16 was built to be able to disassemble easily. The 2 big retaining pins holding the barrel assembly to the trigger assembly and butt are the key components that would dictate whether your zeroing is OK or not. If the pins are fitted loosely, how much zeroing you do will be useless. At long ranges , more than 150m... a small zero error will mean a missed shot.</div></blockquote>Not quite. Remember, the sights/optics and barrel are attached to the upper receiver and are fixed in relation to each other.<br><br>I can conceivably see how a loose-fitting lower receiver and/or buttstock <span style="font-style: italic;">might</span> throw your aim off if it shifts during the critical trigger squeeze, but pressing the entire rifle into your body during the trigger pull should eliminate most if not all of the play between the lower and upper receivers.<br><br>Almost all of the ARs I've come across (including the ones that I build) have <span style="font-style: italic;">some</span> amount of play between the lower and upper receivers, due to variances in manufacturing tolerances. It's just a question of how much. Most of the play can be eliminated by installing a rubber shim like the AccuWedge under the rear take-down pin lug in the lower receiver.<br><br>The prevalence of AR-platform rifles in Highpower competition in the US points to its tremendous accuracy potential. The most important factor in realizing this potential is the use of correct ammo. Commercial and military-surplus ammo are mass-produced and variances in the manufacturing process (oftentimes accompanied by poor quality control) make them shoot inconsistently. Given the right <strong>handloaded</strong> ammo, it is not unusual for an AR-type rifle to achieve this kind of accuracy at 200 yards:<br><br><img src="http://webpages.charter.net/dlwh/Tgt_200yards_AR24.jpg"><br><br>That target, by the way, was achieved with this particular AR:<br><br><img src="http://webpages.charter.net/dlwh/DCGC_070405_08_Small.jpg"><br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Problem with the M16 is the gas gets blow back into the bolt carrier and in the bolt you get harderend crystallized carbon which is not easy to remove ! and also, with the amount of heat generated in close bolt !IN sustain full auto firing, it would generate more jam!<br><br>a piston based M16 like the Heckler and Koch M416<br><br><a href="http://www.hkdefense.us/pages/military-le/rifles-carbines/hk416.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.hkdefense.us/pages/military-le/rifles-carbines/hk416.html</a><br><br>would resolve the whole issues !

When that day comes I suppose.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"><br><br>Really hope someone comes up with a better quadrant sight for the M203.

Yeah, it is in the early days, and with fingers crossed the SAR21 will be improved sufficiently to find its place in the hearts of NSmen or the world market.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>But somehow I don't think they'll be able to reduce the weight much tho.<br><br>But by the time they do, my reservist commitments will probably be over.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>
