            <div class='col-md body'>Like the topic says "Is the AR15/M16 Family of Weapons Obsolete?", in general not just in Singapore. I'm not starting a "_____ VS M16" debate.<br><br>In a period of Piston Operated weapons has the M16 with its Direct Impingement system reached the end of its life?<br><br>Is it really inferior compared to other 5.56mm rifles out there in terms of reliability etc.<br><br>Is the M16 really that terrible a weapon. We've all heard/read the horror stories of the M16 platform, some even make it sound like an over glorified paperweight. But is it really that bad.<br><br>However, I've seen some AR15/M16 take a lot of beating and still keep going.<br><br>Does the modularity of the M16 buy it some points or it just an excuse to keep them.<br><br>Share your opinions, information and experiences with the M16.<br><br>Has the old work horse finally reached the end of its life?</div>

The AK-47 weighs nearly 1 kg more!<br><br>Haha I can easily hold the M16 with 1 hand! In fact my batch jus abt anyone in my platoon could! Wait till you handle support weapons like the Ultimax 100 or GPMG!

Why should we let recruits handle brand new weapons and let them spoil it due to inexperience and rough usage? There is a vast stock of new weapons including M16s that we keep just for open warfare.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Actually right... the AR 15 and the M16 are the same... AR 15 is the name given by colt industries... while M16 is given by the american army for what reason i dont know... but seriously... i think the M16 have been of use to SAF for damn long liao la.... and the rifle seriously has many probs...<br><br>althoug me not in saf.... but i need to cock the weapons 4 times just to do combat zeroing.... the things always kena half feeding and no feed one... damn jialat... the SAF spec says its faulty mag... okay fine but look at the body of the rifle.... so worn out... i think they better service all the M16s... if not it will be a terror to use it....<br><br>Imagine a flawless M16.... i think SAR 21 can be flushed down the toilet... hahah<br><br>I do believe that m16 is one of the better rifles in the world now... compared to SAR 21... always kena chamber explosion... hahaha some say its because of the dbl feeding thingy or sthg got into the chamber.. hahahh..</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Erhhhh... if you not in or have been SAF how come you do zeroing on an M16?  If you talking about it at the the ones you play play with at the various exhibitions etc... aiyah, those not the combat issue ones lah.<br><br>Give me a M16 with a zeroed scope over the SAR21 anyday.  Or even better the Carbine version.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Why would it be obsolete?<br><br>You squeeze the trigger, it goes bang and the round hits generally where it's aimed at (account for your marksmanship skills or lack thereof), and the weapon's perfectly usable.<br><br>As for obsolesence, you would have two major factors: function and availability of consumables.<br><br>Function: the auto-loader superceded the manually loaded rifle, and the full-auto superceded the auto-loader.  Is there any mode of fire for new rifles that the M-16 doesn't have?<br><br>Consumables - 5.56 is still standard issue internationally, and I don't think parts for the M-16 family will run out for quite a while yet.<br><br>Nope, it's not obsolete.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by Shotgun:</div><div class="quote_body">Most of my jams that i got with live firing the M-16 was half feeding or no feeding at all.  Most of the time, the magazine springs were too weak when it contained just 4 rounds. I suppose its not the M-16's fault, but the magazine.<br><br>Besides that, I liked my M-16... i still remember my butt number was 203. Loved it, it was light, and accurate.  I shot off the red glow sticks marking the edge boundaries down range just to prove i could shoot at night as well as in the day. Haha.  Saved my good spec a long walk down to remove it as well.<br></div></blockquote>Yes, forgot about the faulty magazine. That was why during my time when the company went for their marksmanship tests, the OC asked the CQM to draw new magazines. But in war, as a reservist, you will be issued new magazines and new rounds to load.  IAs will seldom happen then.<br><br>Accuracy of the M16...  this was probably the more significant fault compared to other assault rifles.  The M16 was built to be able to disassemble easily. The 2 big retaining pins holding the barrel assembly to the trigger assembly and butt are the key components that would dictate whether your zeroing is OK or not. If the pins are fitted loosely, how much zeroing you do will be useless. At long ranges , more than 150m... a small zero error will mean a missed shot.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Well, I belief the AR15/M16 series weapons are still far away from being scrapped. Why? As its one of the most ergonimacally designed weapon to date and also its lightweight, and easy to train the shooter with.</div>
