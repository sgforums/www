Perhaps they got license agreement with the French to built them. Won't be surprised since French sale India quite a number of stuffs.<br><br>The other is NOT a cuise mssile.

India is not North Korea... they can't ship missiles to other countries and flip the UN the bird when they get caught...<br><br>the attempt to sell the subsystems just seems to be a move to offset some of the costs of this tremendously expensive product... and to establish India's position in the global arms market by offering a lower price than western countries.<br><br>so... with the new Indian "milan" ATGM, has anyone been counting how many ATGM systems are now in the MAF?<br><br>they had the eryx, some pakistani model i can't remember, and now, this??? wah lau... another zoo... and all with range of around 2 km... sigh...<br><br>they win already lah... yeah right... reduce reliance on one dominant supplier... by fragmenting your inventory and farking up your supply chain...<br><br>which is worse? not being able to buy weapons or having SO MANY different systems that u can't support ANY one of them properly?<br></div>

Distribution depends on the unit - Armour, Infantry, Parachute Infantry (RDF) or Commandos.<br><br>The Eryx is a shorter range weapon - could be used at company level for selected units.
