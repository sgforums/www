How to project power?<br><br></div></blockquote>Our C-130 fleet numbers 10 aircraft, comprising 4 C-130B converted to KC-130 aerial refuelling configuration and 6 C-130H transports.<br><br>Personally I would like all these to be retired, given that they were built the late 1970s(KC-130B) and mid 1980s(C-130H), being replaced with an equal number of C-130J models.<br><br>*I know that subsequent posts will state things like cost effectiveness and the like being preferable but it would be wiser to replace them now than to soldier on with airframes nearing 30 years of age soon. Surely 10 C-130Js will not take much of a cut on our budget.</div>
