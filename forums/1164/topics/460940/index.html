              </p><p>This may not be the first time most of you hear someone whining about enlisting in the military for 2 years but just hear me out because i have some points to make and i hope some of you can counter them and enlighten me instead of giving me a generic response such as asking me to skip it and get a jail sentence or imigrate overseas ( it is not that easy ladies.)</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>You would most likely been told since young that singapore is weak and that any country would be capable of taking it. So lets think about it , why would another country want singapore in the first place? Sure it has value as a trading post for other countries but if it was taken over , would other nation want to come and trade in it when there are other ports available that are cheaper and hasn't been invaded?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Attacking a small nation like ours would only anger other huge Nation such as USA and the UK and it may escalate into another war which won't be much of a benefit.War only brings proft the weapon manufacturers. Today companies that creates mass supplies of weapons have no competition and they could charge them as high as they could if a war is to start. This is another reason to avoid a war and invading a country like Singapore.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>With the discovery of the nucleur bomb , what is the use of sending out men to do the fighting when an atomic detenator is enough to wipe out this entire city much less a battlelion of troopers.Even if all of the men that enlist in NS were to go to war , we are still probably fucking vulnerable just by looking the world map. We are fucking surrounded and if we lost all of our defense post , the battle is as good as over.There isn't a second chance to retake the land.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Defending this country for pride and honor is propaganda created by the government to brainwashed us into thinking fighting for the country for glory is what a singaporean is all about. Why risk our life , dreams ,family for some petty dispute a few politicians can't come to an agreement upon?They send the common folk , poor or rich  to defend their ego and all it does is destroy the economy , jobs and lives.In this day and age would anyone living in a 1st world country want to repeat mistakes of the past? </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>War may be for a good cause , if there is injustice , tyranny and facism it could be worth fighting for but with today history and cultural education plus the invention of the internet , many are coming to see the down side of war and let not the colour of our skins or beliefs seperate us. If we know that war is less profitable and only bring unhappiness , what is the point of all this bullshit with serving your country and dying for it?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>War is just young men killing all the other young men that were brainwash into thinking they are fighting for a honorable cause.If that what you want to do it is fine by me , go defend this country without knowing you are being use by the people that run this country i absolutely disagree with how the government force us to enlist in the military or lock us up in a cell should we refuse to join the rest of the herd. It is absolute babaric.</p>

              <p>I posted this topic recently and it has been moved ,edited and locked by a moderator so that no one can discuss the topic like rational people nor was i able to reedited it. I was upset and i would like to have an explanation of why you are doing this.</p>
              <p>It seem that what i heard of how singapore censored other that have disagreement with it policys and are full of imbecile unable to reason with each other without resorting to such junvenille behaviour is true.</p>

              <h2>Why NS?</h2>
              <p>NS was introduced in 1967, just 2 years after Singapore’s
                  independence to ensure the peace and stability of our nation.</p>
              <strong>We are a 'little red dot'.</strong>
              <p>With a population of 4.4 million and a land of 699 square km,
                  Singapore is amongst the 20 smallest countries in the world.
                  Singapore is too small to change the world. Instead, we must adapt
                  as the world changes around us.</p>
              <a class="thumbed_image" rel="lightbox" href="http://iprep.ns.sg/img/asiamap.jpg"><img src="http://iprep.ns.sg/img/asiamap.jpg" alt="Storming the hideout" width="380" height="285"></a>
              <h3>Importance of NS</h3>
              <p><strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">We must be able to defend Singapore ourselves. No one else is
                  responsible for our security and we cannot depend on others to come
                  to our defence.</span></strong></p>
              <p><em><span style="color: #008000;">Our defence is predicated on deterrence. That is why we invest
                  heavily and consistently in building up a strong defence force to
                  provide that deterrence.</span></em></p>
              <p><span style="color: #993300;">At the same time, we seek to be friends with as many countries
                  as possible in the region and beyond. By having friends who can
                  help us in our times of need, we enhance our security.</span></p>
              <h3>Need for NS</h3>
              <p>NS is our only viable option to building up a credible defence
                  force to ensure our survival. A conscription force by law which
                  obliges all eligible people to enlist would create a sizeable
                  standing force ready to guarantee our security.</p>
              <p>The <abbr title="Singapore Armed Forces">SAF</abbr> maintains
                  itself in a high state of operational readiness at all times so
                  that it is able to react swiftly to any threat.</p>
              <p>To meet the defence challenges in the 21st century, the
                  <abbr title="Singapore Armed Forces">SAF</abbr> is upgrading and
                  transforming itself into a highly sophisticated, well-integrated
                  fighting force.</p>
              <p><a class="thumbed_image" rel="lightbox" href="http://iprep.ns.sg/img/storming.jpg"><img src="http://iprep.ns.sg/img/storming.jpg" alt="Third Generation SAF" width="288" height="216"></a></p>
              <p>The Third Generation <abbr title="Singapore Armed Forces">SAF</abbr> will be a network-centric
                  organisation. Our forces will be interconnected, equipped with
                  electronic information systems, and be able to fight cooperatively,
                  and in an integrated manner, on land, in the air and on the
                  sea.</p>
              <p>Within the nation itself, the <abbr title="Singapore Police Force">SPF</abbr> upholds the law and maintains
                  order, keeping the streets safe for family and friends.</p>
              <p>And in case of any crisis or emergency, such as a major accident
                  or a terrorist attack, the <abbr title="Singapore Civil Defence Force">SCDF</abbr> will be there to rescue
                  and save the lives of fellow citizens.</p>
              <p>All together, the <abbr title="Singapore Armed Forces">SAF</abbr>, <abbr title="Singapore Police Force">SPF</abbr> and <abbr title="Singapore Civil Defence Force">SCDF</abbr> play a key role in
                  Singapore’s Total Defence—Military Defence, Civil Defence, Economic
                  Defence, Social Defence and Psychological Defence.</p>

              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>Total Defence</strong> (or <strong>TD</strong>) is the name of <strong><a title="Singapore" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Singapore">Singapore</a>'s comprehensive defence strategy, adapted from countries like <a title="Denmark" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denmark">Denmark</a>, <a title="Sweden" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sweden">Sweden</a>, <a title="Switzerland" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Switzerland">Switzerland</a> and <a title="Austria" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Austria">Austria</a>. </strong></p>
              <p><em><strong>It is based on the understanding that besides military action, aggressors can also defeat the country by wrecking its <a title="Economy" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economy">economic systems</a>, tearing its <a class="mw-redirect" title="Social fabric" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_fabric">social fabric</a> apart, targeting Singaporeans' beliefs and commitment to defence, and 
                      its ability to recover from disasters, both natural and man-made. </strong></em></p>
              <p>The 
                      Total Defence concept encompasses five key aspects – military, civil, 
                      economic, social and psychological defence – and focuses on the need for
                       each Singaporean to play his or her part to defend the nation. These 
                      five aspects are very similar to the "4 Defences" of the Austrian 
                      "Comprehensive National Defense" (<a class="extiw" title="de:Umfassende Landesverteidigung" href="http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Umfassende_Landesverteidigung">Umfassende Landesverteidigung</a>) strategy of 1975.</p>
              <h2><span id="The_Five_Aspects" class="mw-headline">The Five Aspects</span></h2>
              <p>"<strong>Military Defence</strong>" consists of the Singapore Armed Forces (SAF), including its citizen soldiers.<sup id="cite_ref-totaldefence_0-0" class="reference"><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Total_Defence_%28Singapore%29#cite_note-totaldefence-0"><span>[</span>1<span>]</span></a></sup> Their mission is to "enhance Singapore's peace and security through 
                      deterrence and diplomacy, and should these fail, to secure a swift and 
                      decisive victory over the aggressor". As part of the mission, the SAF 
                      strives to maintain a high state of operational readiness 24/7.</p>
              <p>"<strong>Civil Defence</strong>" is about ensuring Singaporeans know what to do
                       in times of an emergency. The Singapore Civil Defence Force (SCDF) 
                      supports this aspect of Total Defence. However, if Singapore encounters a
                       nation-wide emergency (e.g.: terrorism act or war), the SCDF will not 
                      be able to cope with the demands of the situation. Hence, it is crucial 
                      to rope in Singaporeans to help their fellow Singaporeans. To facilitate
                       this, the SCDF recruits and trains civil defence volunteers in first 
                      aid, rescue and evacuation procedures, and shelter management.</p>
              <p>"<strong>Economic Defence</strong>" is defined as maintaining the economy of 
                      the country and its ability to compete in the world, as well as 
                      environmental protection.<sup id="cite_ref-totaldefence_0-1" class="reference"><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Total_Defence_%28Singapore%29#cite_note-totaldefence-0"><span>[</span>1<span>]</span></a></sup> It also involves helping Singapore (and Singaporeans) stay relevant in 
                      the global economy and putting in place economic systems to ensure that 
                      the Singapore economy does not collapse in times of crisis.</p>
              <p>"<strong>Social Defence</strong>" is about keeping the social fabric strong and ensuring that Singaporeans live in harmony regardless of race or religion.<sup id="cite_ref-totaldefence_0-2" class="reference"><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Total_Defence_%28Singapore%29#cite_note-totaldefence-0"><span>[</span>1<span>]</span></a></sup> This is especially important because Singapore is a multi-racial and multi-religious society.</p>
              <p>"<strong>Psychological Defence</strong>" is about loyalty, commitment to Singapore, and having the will power and resilience to overcome challenges.<sup id="cite_ref-totaldefence_0-3" class="reference"><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Total_Defence_%28Singapore%29#cite_note-totaldefence-0"><span>[</span>1<span>]</span></a></sup> This is the component that would determine if Singaporeans will stay to fight or abandon the country when it is in trouble.</p>

              <div><span><strong>Protecting our way of life</strong><br><br>Introduced
                       in 1984, the concept of Total Defence (TD) was adapted from the 
                      experiences of countries like Switzerland and Sweden. As a young nation 
                      with a small population and a conscript armed forces, we needed to draw 
                      on the different strengths and abilities of our community to augment our
                       defence capability. <br><br>Conflicts between countries are no longer 
                      just military in nature. Potential aggressors and threats can appear in 
                      less obvious and non-conventional ways (e.g., destroying social cohesion
                       by exploiting differences in race, language, religion, culture, social 
                      or economic class; weakening national resilience by using psychological 
                      warfare to play on the people’s fears and apprehensions; or waging 
                      economic warfare through economic boycotts, trade sanctions or acts of 
                      sabotage to bring down the economy). Total Defence provides the 
                      framework for a comprehensive and integrated response to deal with all 
                      kinds of threats and challenges. Whether it is a security threat such as
                       global terrorism, or a national crisis like SARS, Total Defence brings 
                      together all relevant government agencies, private sector organisations 
                      and all Singaporeans in a coordinated effort to deal effectively with 
                      these threats and challenges. When Singaporeans take personal 
                      responsibility for and get involved in the defence of Singapore, they 
                      are playing their part to help keep Singapore safe and secure. <br><br>Total
                       Defence has five aspects - Military Defence, Civil Defence, Economic 
                      Defence, Social Defence and Psychological Defence. These five aspects 
                      represent the key sectors of society. They also help Singaporeans 
                      understand how they can be involved. When we take National Service 
                      seriously, volunteer in civil defence exercises, help build a strong 
                      economy, strengthen community ties with one another regardless of race 
                      and religion, and stay committed to defend the country, we are doing 
                      something in every sector of our society to strengthen Singapore's 
                      resilience as a nation.</span></div>

                      represent the five aspects of Total Defence: Military, Civil, Economic, 
                      Social and Psychological Defence. <br><br>The arrows point in the same 
                      upward direction. This signifies concerted effort towards a common 
                      objective of safeguarding the progress and future of Singapore. <br><br>The logo's outline is significant because: <br><br>It
                       is, firstly, the outline of a hand, symbolising action and representing
                       unity and completeness. Total Defence is deficient if any of the five 
                      "fingers" is missing. <br><br>Secondly, the logo is in the shape of a 
                      house, and symbolises Singapore as our homeland. With Total Defence, the
                       security of our homeland is therefore safeguarded. <br><br>The tagline 
                      "It's personal. Play your part." in its handwritten format emphasises 
                      the personal nature of and involvement in Total Defence, reminding 
                      Singaporeans that they have a part to play in the defence of Singapore. 
                      The rounder edges of the logo give it a softer feel, reflecting the 
                      personal stake in Total Defence and encouraging Singaporeans to embrace 
                      Total Defence in their daily lives.<br><br>The crescent and five stars, 
                      and the colours of red and white, are elements from the National Flag. 
                      They represent nationhood. Total Defence brings Singaporeans together as
                       one people. <br><br>Taken as a whole, the logo symbolises all 
                      Singaporeans doing what they can in Total Defence to ensure peace and 
                      security for the future. </span></div>

              <p>And bluntly speaking, Singapore is a chinese majority country but south east asia is not the original homeland of chinese.

              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>Total Defence</strong> (or <strong>TD</strong>) is the name of <strong><a title="Singapore" rel="nofollow" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Singapore">Singapore</a>'s comprehensive defence strategy, adapted from countries like <a title="Denmark" rel="nofollow" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denmark">Denmark</a>, <a title="Sweden" rel="nofollow" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sweden">Sweden</a>, <a title="Switzerland" rel="nofollow" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Switzerland">Switzerland</a> and <a title="Austria" rel="nofollow" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Austria">Austria</a>.</strong></p>
              <p><em><strong>It is based on the understanding that besides military action, aggressors can also defeat the country by wrecking its <a title="Economy" rel="nofollow" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economy">economic systems</a>, tearing its <a title="Social fabric" rel="nofollow" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_fabric">social fabric</a> apart, targeting Singaporeans' beliefs and commitment to defence, and its ability to recover from disasters, both natural and man-made.</strong></em></p>
              <p>The Total Defence concept encompasses five key aspects – military, civil, economic, social and psychological defence – and focuses on the need for each Singaporean to play his or her part to defend the nation. These five aspects are very similar to the "4 Defences" of the Austrian "Comprehensive National Defense" (<a title="de:Umfassende Landesverteidigung" rel="nofollow" href="http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Umfassende_Landesverteidigung">Umfassende Landesverteidigung</a>) strategy of 1975.</p>
              <h2><span>The Five Aspects</span></h2>
              <p>"<strong>Military Defence</strong>" consists of the Singapore Armed Forces (SAF), including its citizen soldiers.<sup><a rel="nofollow" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Total_Defence_%28Singapore%29#cite_note-totaldefence-0"><span>[</span>1<span>]</span></a></sup> Their mission is to "enhance Singapore's peace and security through deterrence and diplomacy, and should these fail, to secure a swift and decisive victory over the aggressor". As part of the mission, the SAF strives to maintain a high state of operational readiness 24/7.</p>
              <p>"<strong>Civil Defence</strong>" is about ensuring Singaporeans know what to do in times of an emergency. The Singapore Civil Defence Force (SCDF) supports this aspect of Total Defence. However, if Singapore encounters a nation-wide emergency (e.g.: terrorism act or war), the SCDF will not be able to cope with the demands of the situation. Hence, it is crucial to rope in Singaporeans to help their fellow Singaporeans. To facilitate this, the SCDF recruits and trains civil defence volunteers in first aid, rescue and evacuation procedures, and shelter management.</p>
              <p>"<strong>Economic Defence</strong>" is defined as maintaining the economy of the country and its ability to compete in the world, as well as environmental protection.<sup><a rel="nofollow" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Total_Defence_%28Singapore%29#cite_note-totaldefence-0"><span>[</span>1<span>]</span></a></sup> It also involves helping Singapore (and Singaporeans) stay relevant in the global economy and putting in place economic systems to ensure that the Singapore economy does not collapse in times of crisis.</p>
              <p>"<strong>Social Defence</strong>" is about keeping the social fabric strong and ensuring that Singaporeans live in harmony regardless of race or religion.<sup><a rel="nofollow" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Total_Defence_%28Singapore%29#cite_note-totaldefence-0"><span>[</span>1<span>]</span></a></sup> This is especially important because Singapore is a multi-racial and multi-religious society.</p>
              <p>"<strong>Psychological Defence</strong>" is about loyalty, commitment to Singapore, and having the will power and resilience to overcome challenges.<sup><a rel="nofollow" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Total_Defence_%28Singapore%29#cite_note-totaldefence-0"><span>[</span>1<span>]</span></a></sup> This is the component that would determine if Singaporeans will stay to fight or abandon the country when it is in trouble.</p>

              <div><span><strong>Protecting our way of life</strong><br><br>Introduced in 1984, the concept of Total Defence (TD) was adapted from the experiences of countries like Switzerland and Sweden. As a young nation with a small population and a conscript armed forces, we needed to draw on the different strengths and abilities of our community to augment our defence capability.<br><br>Conflicts between countries are no longer just military in nature. Potential aggressors and threats can appear in less obvious and non-conventional ways (e.g., destroying social cohesion by exploiting differences in race, language, religion, culture, social or economic class; weakening national resilience by using psychological warfare to play on the people’s fears and apprehensions; or waging economic warfare through economic boycotts, trade sanctions or acts of sabotage to bring down the economy). Total Defence provides the framework for a comprehensive and integrated response to deal with all kinds of threats and challenges. Whether it is a security threat such as global terrorism, or a national crisis like SARS, Total Defence brings together all relevant government agencies, private sector organisations and all Singaporeans in a coordinated effort to deal effectively with these threats and challenges. When Singaporeans take personal responsibility for and get involved in the defence of Singapore, they are playing their part to help keep Singapore safe and secure.<br><br>Total Defence has five aspects - Military Defence, Civil Defence, Economic Defence, Social Defence and Psychological Defence. These five aspects represent the key sectors of society. They also help Singaporeans understand how they can be involved. When we take National Service seriously, volunteer in civil defence exercises, help build a strong economy, strengthen community ties with one another regardless of race and religion, and stay committed to defend the country, we are doing something in every sector of our society to strengthen Singapore's resilience as a nation.</span></div>

              <p>Humans are nor selfish beings, they are the most selfless beings by nature. Just that some twats are raised to believe that they have to be selfish in order to 'survive'. Also, our so called army is a defense military, to protect against assholes like terrorists and such. We do not have any way to protect ourselves during a straight out war.</p>

              <p>I went off to bed last night so i wasn't able to response early.Anyway some of you made good points on how a small country like ours need a strong military force.</p>
              <p>But i am still not satisfied on how this justify the government to instill fear onto us of getting a felony should we choose to skip it.

              <p>The first poster asks very relevant questions which should be asked from time to time. War is pointless. The point is that not everyone shares that view.</p>
                          
                  <p>Singapore had zero resources in 1941. Yet by 1942, the Japanese had taken over Singapore, chinese residents were massacred on the beaches. In the 60s, communism had taken hold of Malaya. By the 1970s, communism threatened to overrun south east asia from Indochina to Indonesia. In the last decade, the threat had transformed into an extra-national one with shadow organisations such as JI planning attacks in the little red dot.</p>
                          
                          <p>To assume that Singapore has nothing to offer is not reality. Singapore is today an economic juggernaut not because someone said so. Singapore port status and geographical position makes it a strategic location where MNCs set up HQs. It sits at the heart of a trade route where 70% of the world's oil traffic passes. If Singapore chokes off the Malaccan straits, 1 billion chinese go without electricity. Do you think the Chinese government dont see that?</p>
                          
                          <p>Today, the regional threats are diminished not because Singapore has no army but because it has an effective one. It takes many many years of investment and training to build up an effective army. It can take only a year or less (or simply an act of parliament) to eliminate it. Whether NS can sustain Singapore's security in the future is subject to debate. There may be other options to NS. Only Singaporeans can decide how safe Singapore should be. Sure, maybe a little less investment on defence or less time spent on NS may not compromise security...or it may. The young are willing to take more risk. Older folks, maybe not. It may be a tired old phrase but a wrong choice can = no more Singapore.</p>

              Leatsalmonfish, just serve your NS military service then you will know the meaning of your service to the country. There is no problem just follow whatever you are ordered to do and you will be ok. Good Luck.

              <p>National service is needed because we do not have enough

                          years too, but there are in a diff circumstances(provocation from
                          the north).</p>
              <p>National Service in other countries:</p>
              <p>Taiwan = 4 months(2014 onwards), I believe(if not wrong) there
                          are thousands of missiles aimed directly at Taiwan.</p>
              <p>Switerland = 5 months</p>
              <p>Singapore = 2 years!! WHY?? we are in peace zone, aren't we?</p>

              <p>"National Service is a waste of time and torture."</p>
              <p>I've heard many people say that, but, so what? It is not a waste of time for I am damn sure some things we learn in NS can be applied to life. And you may think it is a torture, but I don't think it is torturous. Somehow, I feel that the need to face the workforce is MUCH MORE torturous. What's so bad about keeping fit in the Army than to face the attitude of your boss everyday. At the same time lazing in the office and turning fat? (Not everyone is like that I know) Suffering from high blood pressure from the stress.</p>
              <p>And by the way, I would consider these boys who stated the above as pampered and have no ability to endure hardship. Would be worse when they face the workforce.</p>
              <p>For those who say just serve and zao, really haven't learn anything from the two years of valuable experience. Does it matter how long other countries serve? Malaysia serve 3 months do you want to migrate there? For what I know Singapore is the most fair in racial equalities in the region, but also the place where there are the most pampered kids complaining about National Service. Take a look at Isreal, no one is complaining about their 3 years of service and their strict standards. (such as having to carry their rifle wherever they go even when they 'book out') Why are you complaining now?</p>
              <p>Personally, I wouldn't want to change the law, rather I hope the government enforce it more strictly. Hate me for all you like, but I will get this straight, without a country, you have no home. Migrate for all you want, but remember what your ancestors had gone through to keep what Singapore is today. </p>
              <p>If one day a second Japanese Occupation occurs because people like you is unwilling to serve, how would YOU be able to cope with the guilt? Your family members and relatives all massacred? Think man THINK.</p>

              <p>Actually that offers no help to actual citizens of Singapore. I tell you this, someone who has a real job for 2 years instead of doing NS is helping the country much more, as they are responsible for at least something productive.
