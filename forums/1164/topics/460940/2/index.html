              <p>I'm sure.</p>
              <p>But you should give them due respect.</p>
              <p>And if you dont realise, NSFs form part of the RSN staffing also.</p>
              <p>Look at where the collision took place and you will see what I mean by "keeping you safe". The ship was involved in an accident on patrol. If you can't be bothered to even find out the area it was patrolling, I think you shouldn't act smart and say what you wish.</p>
              <p>You people don't know.</p>
              <p>The frontline units are the ones who keep us safe.</p>
              <p>And who do you think comes to your aid when you need them? You can jolly well tell the SCDF peeps to buzz off when the time comes when you need them?</p>
              <p>I dont think so.</p>
              <p>You simply dont have the balls to.</p>
              <p>You think just soft power gets you far? Your project would be possible without the sacrifices of others? Think carefully.</p>
              <p>It riles and irks me to see you people take security for granted.</p>
              <p>On the one hand, its best you guys dont know whatever happens too. *shrugs*</p>

              <p>Sigh.... another thread involving a pre-enlistee who is making all sorts of noise about how NS is pointless. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="icon_rolleyes.gif"></p>
              <p>Listen, kid, I'm not going to talk about responsibility or our geo-political situation or whatever, because you're only going to write me off as an old codger spouting government propanganda.</p>
              <p>All I have to say is this: You're going to do NS one way or the other, so drop this attitude of yours. Tell yourself: <em>'I may not enjoy doing this, but I've got to do it, so I might as well make the best of my time in here</em>.'</p>
              <p>Because one thing is for sure (and all the other old codgers will agree with me on this): <strong>If you enter NS with this sort of attitude, you're going to really, really suffer.</strong></p>
              <p>So do yourself a favour and drop this attitude. Seriously.</p>

              <p>True that. <br><br>Putting aside his conscientious objections (or what some might see as cowardice), I also want to talk about the changes in civilian life after being a conscript. Donald Trump talked about how military school gives an unfair advantage to them when they come out in the private sector. As they are taught about the bigger picture stuff, like the outer side of the B-I triangle.<img src="http://jeremiahjosey.files.wordpress.com/2010/09/bi_triangle.jpg" alt="" width="913" height="790"></p>

              <p>No doubt, shyt will definitely happen, u may be punish for the *most ridiculous reasons, double standarding and see the ugly side of humans. On the bright side, all these is a prelude or a milder version of what you will be facing when you enter the working world. Here is also where u can see who u really r, learn to go w the flow or endure wat crap they throw at you, only fight the battles you can win and most important of all, make allies and learn who u can trust.</p>
              <p>*most ridiculous reasons example: You got to do pumping because you don support the same football club as your OC</p>
              <p>Double standard: OC say cannot gamble in camp, but he is gambling away with my team mates while the rest of us is doing dirty jobs</p>
              <p>Ugly side of humans: OIC accused u of being a gay for the fun out of it.</p>

              When I did my NS, no maid leh. Fewer young people these days got respect for old ex-reservist....
              
              In my day, have to chong swa with very heavy equipment and dig trench while under the obligatory constant abuse. lol. Today, NSmen can play computer games eg simulator and got Ipad somemore! The difference most obvious to me is that I hear today NSnen in some camps take bath even got hot water!
              
              Singapore will eventually belong to next generation. They have decide for themselves whether NS is relevant. If they want to hear advice from oldie, that's up to them. If they make wrong decision, they pay the price.

              <p><br>not the rich ones but those middle and lower classes too.they all dont want to work even in ns and expect their comrades to shoulder n do their job for them.these are the citizens who are too lazy to do their own job and not that capable for future undertakings .</p>
              <p>the outcome is pretty obvious!more capable sporeans will leave spore and left spore with the lazy ones who dont even want to do their own ns even!</p>
              <p>i remebered when  i was doing my ns reservist duty  years ago and found out that those 2 years ns people expect the reservists to do their job while they stand there n SUPERVISE ONLY!its as if they are not happy to even do ns and expect the reservist to do their ns for them as well.</p>
              <p>once i even heard them say anything call the r ns reservist to do their simple  2 years ns job for them.</p>
              <p>i cant imagine what the country and the economy will be like when these people come out at work for MNC profit orientated companies.</p>
