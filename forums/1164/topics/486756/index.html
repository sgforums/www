              <p>Should you and your family face financial hardship, you can
                  apply for financial assistance. The quantum of financial assistance
                  is the difference between your family’s minimum subsistence level
                  and monthly income. It’s best to talk to your officer on how to
                  apply for this scheme upon enlistment.</p>
              <p>To alleviate your family's household expenses, you can apply
                  these.<br> <br> <strong>Financial Assistance Term Grants</strong><br> For needy NSF whose families encounter financial hardship as a
                  result of their enlistment into the SAF<br> <br> <strong>Welfare Financial Assistance Grant/Loan</strong><br> Assistance provided to active servicemen who are in a financial
                  predicament beyond their control eg. theft, fine, medical bills,
                  spouse retrenchment. Assistance takes the following form:<br> <br> Grant: (a) CO Contingency Grant (b) Welfare Grant<br> Loan: Welfare Loan<br> <br> For full detail, please refer to welfare circular 3-39.<br> For Term Financial Assistance enquiries please call 6373 1150; 6363

                  3338; 6373 3336<br> <br> <strong>The SAF Finance Clinic</strong><br> The Finance Clinic is set up with the aim to assist servicemen who
                  are financially distressed. Servicemen in financial distress must
                  come forward and they must go through the formal channel of
                  declaration before assistance can be rendered. The SFC aims to
                  provide debt management to distressed servicemen, so as to mitigate
                  their situation from deterioriating into an indebtedness cycle.
                  Credit Counselling Singapore (CCS) had been engaged to assess and
                  structure the debt management plan. Servicemen who does not meet
                  the CCS criteria will be referred back to SFC for other forms of
                  help e.g. through welfare grant or loan.</p>

                  and monthly income. It’s best to talk to your officer on how to
                  apply for this scheme upon enlistment.</strong><br> <br> Before his National Service (NS) enlistment, Private (PTE) Max
                  Al-Fyan Yew bin Abdul Hafiz Yew drew a stable income of about $700
                  a month working in sales and was the breadwinner in his family.
                  Hence, he was understandably worried when he learnt that his
                  monthly NS allowance would be half of what he used to earn.<br> <br> Fortunately, with the intercession of his superiors in the SAF, the
                  SAF Personnel Services Centre (SAFPSC) was able to help him through
                  SAF Financial Assistance Schemes. Said the supply assistant of
                  Supply Hub East: "I’m thankful for the extra $600 that I receive
                  every month on top of my regular NS allowance as it has greatly
                  contributed to the payment of my family’s bills."<br> <br> 1st Warrant Officer (1WO) Kng Ter Sern, Officer-in-Charge Asset
                  Management Team, Pasir Ris Camp, went one step further by following
                  up on PTE Yew’s case when his initial Term Financial Assistance
                  Scheme expired. Said 1WO Kng: "Caring for our soldiers is one of
                  the SAF core values...when Max’s initial financial assistance
                  scheme ended in December last year, I conducted a house visit and
                  recommended that he receive further financial help from the
                  SAF."<br> <br> PTE Yew is just one of many examples of how the welfare schemes
                  administered by the SAFPSC have benefitted around 65,000 in-service
                  personnel of the Ministry of Defence (MINDEF) and the SAF, as well
                  as Operationally Ready National Servicemen (NSmen).<br> <br> "The SAFPSC’s primary role is to strategise and design welfare
                  structures in order to support the SAF’s philosophy on welfare...
                  We believe in the virtues of commitment and engagement, and to
                  achieve that, we are concerned with the well-being of personnel and
                  their families," said Lieutenant Colonel (LTC) (NS) Koa Boon Teck,
                  Head of SAFPSC.<br> <br> As secretariat to the SAF Welfare Council, the SAFPSC introduces,
                  implements and reviews the proposed welfare schemes and services.
                  Its welfare efforts cover five broad areas: health care, work-life
                  balance, finance, vacations and insurance.<br> <br> On the SAFPSC's latest efforts in improving welfare support, LTC
                  (NS) Koa said: "We want to move away from the mental model of
                  welfare as a reactive element, where people subscribe to welfare
                  only when they are in need..we felt that there was an impetus to
                  changing the image of welfare."<br> <br> Here are some of the latest welfare initiatives spearheaded by the
                  SAF Welfare Council and the SAFPSC:<br> <br> <strong>SAF Central Welfare Fund Bursary Awards</strong><br> 2nd Warrant Officer (2WO) Tanusha Tan of Headquarters 9th Division,
                  whose 19-year-old daughter, Natasha, received the Bursary Award at
                  the polytechnic level worth $1,200 last year, remembers her
                  daughter being ecstatic at receiving the notification of her
                  successful application.<br> <br> "It was a very good morale booster for Natasha, and it will surely
                  further encourage her to do well," added 2WO Tan.<br> <br> Starting from February this year, the award, which is given to the
                  children of MINDEF/SAF personnel to recognise their academic
                  excellence up to the local degree level, now has a qualifying
                  family income cap of $4,000 levied on each level of study, compared
                  to the previous staggered qualifying income caps across all levels
                  of study. In addition, the quantum awarded for all levels of study,
                  less the junior colleges, polytechnics and local universities, has
                  been increased.<br> <br> <strong>SAF holidays/ vacation spots</strong><br> The SAF Seaview Resort, Bintan Lagoon Resort &amp; Golf Club, as
                  well as the Joondalup Bungalows in Perth, Australia, are examples
                  of resorts which recently underwent their first major revamp to
                  ensure the highest levels of modernity and aesthetic appeal for
                  holiday-makers.<br> <br> More exciting locations have also been added to the stable of SAF
                  vacation spots, including the Amara Sanctuary Sentosa, Ascott Kuala
                  Lumpur and Club Bali. This means that active servicemen and NSmen
                  can enjoy relaxing stays at a wider array of resorts, at exclusive
                  prices of up to 60 percent below published rates.<br> <br> In addition, a new travel portal will soon be introduced to allow
                  MINDEF/SAF personnel and NSmen greater flexibility, choice and cost
                  savings when booking rooms, airfares, car rental and even travel
                  insurance when they go on vacations. Named Free Independent Travel,
                  the interactive and user-friendly one-stop portal will be launched
                  tentatively on 1 Apr.</p>
              <p><strong>SAF Group Term Life (GTL) Insurance
                  Scheme</strong><br> From 1 Jan 09 onwards, the scheme automatically covers
                  newly-recruited MINDEF/SAF personnel for $100,000, and now has a
                  maximum coverage of up to $600,000, unless they choose to opt out.
                  Spouses and dependants are included in the coverage, which extends
                  beyond the serviceman’s stay in MINDEF/SAF. NSmen are also eligible
                  for the competitively-priced scheme.<br> <br> More information can be obtained via the Aviva-SAF Insurance
                  Infoline at 68278000.<br> <br> <strong>SAF Financial Assistance Schemes</strong><br> <em>Last September, monetary lifelines such as the Term Financial
                  Assistance Scheme, which aims to alleviate the financial stresses
                  of servicemen, were improved. This scheme, which helps needy NSFs,
                  had its period of assistance extended from six months till the
                  serviceman's Operationally Ready Date but subjected to review after
                  12 months. A term financial loan scheme was also launched for needy
                  servicemen.</em><br> <br> <strong>100% subsidy for Defensive Riding Course
                  (DRC)</strong><br> As of 1 Oct 09, the DRC, which is designed specifically for
                  MINDEF/SAF personnel, became fully subsidised. Held at the
                  Singapore Safety Driving Centre (SSDC) located in Woodlands, the
                  half-day course aims to encourage road safety among those who
                  regularly commute to work or perform despatch duties by
                  motorcycle.<br> <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><em><br> *Applications for most of the welfare schemes can be found on the

              Stay in camp and go back to see your parents and siblings, once or twice in a month. If you want to go outings with your friends or girlfriend(s), just go and after that return to your camp. Food and lodging is free in the army. 'Buy' guard duties from those who are 'selling' guard duties, this has been the tradition in the army haha. Source in the market for cheap and good quality items like t-shirts, jeans, wallets, shoes etcs; and sell them to your buddies, NCOs and Officers. When you live in the army barracks, everybody will know you and you will be like popular in your camp haha.

              <p>Wah...quite a lot these days.... during my time, recruits' allowance was only $135.   I was drawing around $800 per month (plus additional CPF) before enlistment and pay was reduced to just 16.8% of pre-enlistment salary which already was lower than others because of shorter duration anticipation (told them enlisting in army soon).</p>
              <p>Those days chicken rice $1.50-$2 per plate....now $3 per plate.</p>
