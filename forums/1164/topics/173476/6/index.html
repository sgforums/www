            <div class='col-md body'>BTW, I do notice that every year, without fail, there will be crows watching performing aircrafts next to humans. That's not all, they try to perform alongside with the performers and I think they managed to draw more attention. Stunts include: Flying close to stalling speed before diving, tight turns, changing directions abruptly, and best of all, flying backwards with the help of wind! Its free of charge somemore!<img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I've seen vids of a crow, snatch a walnut, fly around a highway with the uncracked nut.  Wait for a car, does a vertical landing in the car's path, drop the walnut and goes for a vertical take off before the car comes and hovers to watch the walnut get crushed.  Then it does a vertical landing, to eat the insides of the nut.<br><br>BEAT THAT F-16!</div>
