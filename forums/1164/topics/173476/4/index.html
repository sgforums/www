LOUIS, Feb. 20, 2006 -- The Republic of Singapore Air Force (RSAF) has reassigned three of its AH-64D Apache Longbow multi-role combat helicopters from its training base in the United States to a RSAF facility in Singapore, marking the first-ever deployment of international Apache helicopters in Asia.<br><br>One of the Apache Longbows, produced by The Boeing Company [NYSE: BA] in Mesa, Ariz. , is on display this week at the 2006 Asian Aerospace exhibition in Singapore.<br><br>U.S. Army Apaches have been stationed in Asia over the past decade, but Singapore , which joined the Apache family in 1999, had previously assigned its growing fleet to training duties at a facility in Arizona.Singapore has ordered 20 Apache Longbow helicopters and has logged more than 8,000 accident-free hours in the past three-and-a-half-years while training in Arizona.Singapore received its first eight in 2002 and began receiving the first of the final 12 in January 2006.<br><br>The first of the three Apache Longbows sent to Singapore was ceremoniously accepted in Arizona in January before being flown to Singapore by transport aircraft.<br><br>"The return marks a significant milestone for the Republic of Singapore Air Force.In the U.S. , they have had very good training value. They were able to practice and train the components, the proficiencies and the competencies. Now we can look at the bigger scheme of things and fit them in with the other pieces to set the stage for a new era for our defense force," said Colonel Tan Wee Ngee, Commander, Sembawang Air Base.<br><br>Boeing and the RSAF have been working closely to ensure the program meets or exceeds requirements and will continue to ensure that the RSAF has the resources to maintain and operate its aircraft in Singapore.<br><br>"The Singapore Apache program continues to make great strides and achieve significant milestones," said Tommy Filler, Boeing director of International Apache Programs. "Our overall success reflects outstanding teamwork and long-term commitments from everyone involved. And we're equally proud that the Republic of Singapore Air Force is the first of our international customers in Asia to field the Apache."<br><br>The Apache Longbow features fully integrated avionics and weapons plus a state-of-the-art modem transmitting real-time, secure digitized battlefield information to air and ground forces. It can rapidly detect, classify, prioritize and engage stationary or moving opposition targets at standoff ranges in nearly all weather environments.<br>A unit of The Boeing Company, Boeing Integrated Defense Systems is one of the world's largest space and defense businesses. Headquartered in St. Louis, Boeing Integrated Defense Systems is a $30.5 billion business. It provides network-centric system solutions to its global military, government, and commercial customers. It is a leading provider of intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance systems; the world's largest military aircraft manufacturer; the world's largest satellite manufacturer and a leading provider of space-based communications; the primary systems integrator for U.S. missile defense; NASA's largest contractor; and a global leader in sustainment solutions and launch services.<br>###<br>Contact Info:<br>Hal Klopper<br>The Boeing Company<br>office: 480-891-5519<br>mobile: 602-391-7489<br>hal.g.klopper@boeing.com</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>"Network centric, stealthy platforms - indigenouslly designed naval platforms, such as the 'Tiger Shark', a future frigate design, and the 'Blue Shark', a future corvette design."<br><br>Hmmm..........this is taken from page three, was wondering wat is this Blue and Tiger shark design? Anione got potos? Are those respective names given to the 62m and 81m stealth corvettes found on ST page? Was also wondering if the Navy would replace the victory class with them, or perhaps increase the fleet size? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_idea.gif" alt="Idea" title="Idea"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Just wanna tell you guys a bad experience I had today at the Airshow. Those farking CISCO guards are so frigging irritating. They have small arms on display there and as I was wanted the opportunity to fiddle with the SIG 550 series of weapons, I picked it up. He snatched it from me and said that No Touching. But I was like wtf...got no sign say cannot touch the weapons lor. And thankfully, the exhibitors saw what was going on and approached us, he allowed me and others to fiddle with the SSG in the end.<br><br>Its an Airshow, and people pay top money to be let in. And we do understand the need for safety and security, but having these fat and unfit CISCO guards who do nothing but try to exercise what pathetic powers they have really piss me off!I complained to the one of the show organizers in the end, however they did not give a solid reply or reasoning for the undue rudeness and unpractical approach of the CISCO guard.</div>

Because they have to guard weapons 4-5 metres apart but yet only 1 person.<br><br>This is especially the MP-9 and FGM exhibit.

            <div class='col-md body'>Honestly,do you guys know how much those companies must pay to hire each CISCO guard? They charge like 2k a day.And honestly, look at them.If anyone really wants to stun the weapons, they can simply cut the cable with wires and run. I mean if there are no passer-bys or SPF or SAF personnel helping them, the person can run the CISCO guards to death. Totally ridiculous...Really don't see the wisdom in hiring such an excessive number of them.So restrictive, might as well not have a show.</div>
