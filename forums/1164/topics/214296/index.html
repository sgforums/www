It marks a historic event as it greatly encouraged and pleased the KPA (Korean People's Army) and people that have wished to have powerful self-reliant defense capability," KCNA reported.<br><br>"It will contribute to defending the peace and stability on the Korean Peninsula and in the area around it."<br><br>The U.S. Geological Survey's Rafael Abreau said the earthquake-measuring agency has not recorded any seismic activity from North Korea.<br><br>However, South Korean intelligence officials said a seismic wave of magnitude-3.58 had been detected in North Hamkyung province, according to Yonhap.<br><br>In Tokyo, the prime minister's office said Japan had set up a task force to address the situation.<br><br>High-level South Korean officials were meeting Monday after intelligence of the suspected test was received.<br><br>"President Roh Moo-hyun called in an emergency meeting of related ministers on Monday to discuss the North Korean nuclear issue," said Yonhap, quoting Foreign Ministry spokesman Choo Kyu-ho.<br><br>"The meeting comes as there has been a grave change in the situation involving the North's nuclear activity."<br><br>According to KCNA, there was no radioactive leakage from the site.<br><br>On Friday, the U.N. Security Council warned North Korea against performing a nuclear test, citing unspecified action if it should do so.<br><br>It also called on North Korea to return immediately to the six-party talks with China, Japan, South Korea, Russia and the United States.<br><br>'Serious provocation'<br>Citing American belligerence and pressure, North Korea said Tuesday that a nuclear test was in the works. A date and time for the test was not given.<br><br>The report of the test came as Japan's new Prime Minister Shinzo Abe arrived in Seoul for meetings with President Roh Moo-hyun to address the nuclear issue as well as address strains in relations between the two countries over territorial and historical disputes.<br><br>North Korea accused rival South Korea on Monday of committing a serious provocation by firing warning shots during a weekend incident in which the South says soldiers from the communist North crossed over their border.<br><br>The border shooting came Saturday. South Korean soldiers rattled off about 40 warning shots after a group of five North Korean troops crossed into the southern side of the no-man's-land separating the divided Korean peninsula, South Korea said.<br><br>No one was hurt in the incident.<br><br>On Monday, members of the U.N. Security Council are expected to select South Korean Foreign Minister Ban Ki-moon to succeed Kofi Annan as secretary-general of the world body.<br><br>In a straw poll last Monday, all but one of the 15 council members supported that choice, according to Chinese Ambassador Wang Guangya.<br><br>John Bolton, U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, refused to discuss the outcome of the vote, but said: "I think it was sufficiently clear that all members of the council agreed to move to a formal vote on Monday night," he said. The announcement would be made Tuesday, he said.<br><br>CNN's Jamie McIntyre, Barbara Starr, Sohn Jie-ae and Elise Labott contributed to this report<br><br>Copyright 2006 CNN.

            <div class='col-md body'>(This post has been cross-posted among multiple forums)<br><br>I think it's time the international community further isolate this country by severing all diplomatic ties, shutting down every North Korean embassy out there, getting the small international community in North Korea to pull out of there, and to literally seal North Korea off from the outside world through all means, in order to send a very strong message to their government. This even if this means starving their (innocent) citizens to death; in fact, this might drive even more North Koreans out of their country and isolate North Korea even further.<br><br>However, any calls for military action should be considered carefully. You are now dealing with a country that can create a nuclear winter if you wage war with them. Moreover, military action can only serve to be a stepping stone to World War III, considering all the messiness we already have in other parts of the world. Governments must not react in a knee-jerk manner and carefully consider every possibility, including, in this case, total world war and it's scary consequences (think: end of the world). In my opinion, <span style="color: red;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">peaceful but strong, immediate, real, and frim actions must be taken against North Korea <strong>now</strong></span></span> in order for any progress to happen. Going to war will only make matters worse. Much, much worse.<br><br>Japan must also not use this as an excuse to go into militarism. I often regard Japan's move to a true pacifist country at the end of World War II (even if it was unfairly forced by the U.S.) as the right move, and a move every country should work towards. Going into militarism will be a great leap backwards for Japan, and will not help at all in mantaining the already-troubled "peace" of the world. In fact, hearing all the reports that a new arms race may be sparked off, Japan will only help it by going into militarism.</div>

If they ever do so, (they wont) China has all right to invade or rather reclaim taiwan. the chinese government has and always will view taiwan as its own. Only taiwan is playing around with the idea of being seperate from China.<br><br>For me i really hope Taiwan goes back to China perhaps under the S.A.R. just like Macau and HK. Afterall they are Chinese, they came from the mainland was together in the past so i see no reason why they want to be seperated. Perhaps someone can enlighten me. Is it idealogyÂ�H after china opened up, its really not that unbearable propaganda like what the North Koreans are still doing.<br><br>For the NK nuke issue, some has already mentioned that war will just make things worse. Thats is perfectly true and correct. And since China is reluctant to make the DPRK's government collapse due to the influx of hungry refugees, that is the main problem in my opinion the world should solve. perhaps standby rations and then seal off all trade and communications with NK and watch them tumble. No food, equals to hungry people or possibly dead people, and dead people means no fingers on the red button.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>The only peaceful solution present is for NK to disarm its nuclear arsena, and allow UN inspectors to ensure.  Chance of that happening? Not likely.<br><br>The other options may include sanctions and cutting off all aid to North Korea.  People will starve and die, while Comrade Daffy Duck enjoys 20 course meals with his nuclear scientists.<br><br>A military option is NEEDED before NK can develop capabilities to actually launch their nukes.  Should they be able to mate their Nukes to their long range missiles, they will threaten the entire region, and all the way up to Alaska.  Everything from Japan, China, S.Korea, Taiwan, and the Russo-Jap oil pipelines can be hit.<br><br>Allowing North Korea to keep its nuclear arsenal, would mean countries such as Japan and South Korea arming up too. And what you have is a nuclear mine field in North east asia.  Do we really want things to escalate to such a point before any action is taken?<br><br>I've mention before in militarynuts that as unfavorable as a conventional campaign may be, it may be the only solution.  If the Chinese are willing to go along with this, to bring their disobedient allies under control, it may be over pretty quickly.  A coalition for Chinese, Japanese, South Korean and American Forces maybe what is needed to demonstrate a unified resolve to see a nuclear free Korean Peninsular.<br><br>After that, can always divide North Korea up 4 ways with individual administrative regions under the various coalition nations.  Together with the UN to oversee, it maybe a solution to the North Korean problem once and for all.

But for 550 Tonnes of TNT to cause a 4.2 earthquake.  I believe public discussion believes otherwise.<br><br>To create an earthquake of magnitude 4 on the richter scale, u need at least 56,000 kg of explosives.  I was told that conventional explosives cannot be used to create earthquakes, else they would have succeeded at using explosives to create earthquakes to relieve "stressed" areas to prevent larger earthquakes.<br><br>But still point taken.  The North Koreans created a seismic event of 4.2 by detonating what is now suspected to be a nuclear weapon.

If they ever do so, (they wont) China has all right to invade or rather reclaim taiwan. the chinese government has and always will view taiwan as its own. Only taiwan is playing around with the idea of being seperate from China. </blockquote>Well storm, you are absolutely correct.  There is definitely no need for China to use nukes on Taiwan (in the eventuality of an armed takeover of the island) as PLA numbers alone can overwhelm ROC numbers.  I am toying, not promoting the idea mind you, that the Taiwanese taking a page out of the NK's reasonance of having nukes as self defence (against the US), will now be tempted to develop nuke weapons and using such weapons as a cornerstone as the main deterrant against superior PLA numbers.  Remember, in the event of a PLA invasion of Taiwan, the latter knows it will be the 1st war (against PLA on Taiwanese soil) and last war, so the Taiwanese authorities have nothing to lose here.  Imagine, if the taiwanese leaders gonna lose their country, might as well take Beijing, Shanghai down with it.  Now if you are Beijing, will you make a move?  You can but are you willing to pay the price (Taipei will not be the only city in ruins, but a nuked Beijing &amp; Shanghai too?)<br><br><blockquote><br><br>Originally posted by storm_freaky13:<br><br>For me i really hope Taiwan goes back to China perhaps under the S.A.R. just like Macau and HK.

As this thread is about NK nuclear test, I will not discuss this Taiwan/China issue here.<br><br>Let me leave a thought for you and using your argument <span style="font-style: italic;">"...

Like what you said Beijing will not be willing to lose its capital or other major cities just to get back taiwan. Besides the Chinese local authorities view taiwan as their province so i believe if TW tries to obtain nukes, diplomacy will be first, if it fails an invasion is inevitable.<br><br>Very good point for the second part its a real enlightenment. but i believe in time to come maybe 10 years or more Taiwan will return to china. How though its open to imagination and the steps the respective governments take. Singapore is different because we are recognised as a soveriegn nation but for Taiwan not many countries recognise its sovereignity. Enough about china for now perhaps we can carry on our discussion in private message? haha<br></div>
