Singapore Technologies Kinetics is itself the land systems arm of Singapore Technologies Engineering (ST Engineering). A further subsidiary company of ST Kinetics - Advanced Material Engineering Pte. Ltd. (AME) - designs and manufactures conventional and smart munitions advanced protective materials as well as guided system components.<br>In 1994, the company disclosed that it was developing, as a private venture, the 40 mm L70 Field Air Defence Mount (FADM). This is an improved version of the standard combat-proven Saab Bofors Dynamics 40 mm L70 towed anti-aircraft gun covered later in this section.<br>The 40 mm Field Air Defence Mount (FADM) was successfully tested and proof fired in 1996 and initial production has now commenced.<br><br>Description<br><br>Today's air defence threats, with their higher speeds and greater manoeuvrability, make more demands on the air defence weapon. Modern air defence weapon systems must offer high-hit probabilities, fast response times, autonomy and round-the-clock operation.<br>FADM has been designed to meet these requirements and is said to be capable of<strong> intercepting all kinds of high-speed aerial and surface targets.</strong> To carry out this mission it has the following advanced features:<br><br>1. Electric drive aiming system using brushless motors to attain high tracking and aiming accuracy in very quick time.<br>2. Battery powered, providing immediate and non-interruptible source of power supply on demand.<br>3.<strong> 101-round dual-compartment 40 mm magazine to allow for ample engagements without reloading and immediate selection of two types of ammunition providing the unique capability of defending against aerial and surface targets simultaneously and instantly.<br>4. Fires the highly destructive 40 mm L70 PFHE at a cyclic rate-of-fire of 330 rds/min to provide an effective and sustained defence against modern air targets.<br>5. On-mount Optronic Fire-Control System (OFCS) with FLIR for autonomous, round-the-clock operations and ECM immunity.<br></strong>  6. New rigid one-piece carriage providing a stable firing platform on land.<br>7. An automatic levelling device to allow for very quick deployment in less than three minutes with an accuracy of Â±1 mrad. Immediate deployment is also possible under emergency situations, for example, the gun can be lowered to the ground with its outriggers spread for stability and firing can commence almost immediately.<br><br>Although the AOS 40 mm L70 FADM is fully autonomous, it can be interfaced easily with any remote fire-control system. The weapon system is complemented by a full range of 40 mm L70 ammunition including PFHE, HE-T and PT. Production of this ammunition is undertaken in Singapore.<br><br>Specifications<br><br>Weapon<br>Calibre: 40 mm<br>Number of barrels: 1<br>Barrel length: 2.8 m<br>Recoil mechanism: hydro-spring<br>Breech mechanism: vertical sliding<br>Weight: (excluding ammunition) 6,000 kg<br>Max length: (tow bar extended) 6.60 m<br>Max width: 2.25 m<br>Max height:<br>(travelling) 2.5 m (includes the installation of electro-assembly)<br>(trunnion above ground) 1.30-1.50 m (firing position)<br>Traversing radius: 3.26 m (firing position)<br>Ground clearance: (travelling) 0.39 m<br>Track: 2.00 m<br>Wheelbase: 4.05 m<br>Elevation/depression: +80Âº/-4Âº<br>Traverse: 360Âº<br>Power operation:<br>(max elevation speed) 60Âº/s<br>(max elevation acceleration) 152Âº/s2<br>(max traverse speed) 100Âº/s<br>(max traverse acceleration) 152Âº/s2<br>Synchro ratio (coarse): 1:1<br>Synchro ratio (fine): 16:1<br>FCS interface: RS422 or MIL-STD-1553B<br>Rate of fire: 330 rds/min<br>Numbers of rounds on gun: 101<br>Effective anti-aircraft range: 4,000 m<br>Main voltage: 3 Ã— 415 V 60 Hz<br>Power consumption: 5 kVA max<br>Reference voltage: 115 V 400 Hz<br>Battery voltage: 48 V<br>Battery capacity: 100 Ah<br><br>Electro-optic fire-control system<br>Laser range-finder<br>Wavelength: 1.54 Âµm (eye safe)<br>Pulse repetition rate: continuous, 3 Hz<br>Accuracy: 7 m<br>Range: 6,000 m<br>Technology: Neodymium: YaG and Radan shift cell (standard atmosphere and NATO standard)<br><br>FLIR<br>Wavelength: 8-12 Âµm (TCM detectors) (options for 3-5 Âµm)<br>Cooler: integral stirling cycle<br>Cool-down time: 3 min<br>Narrow field of view: 2 Ã— 3Âº<br>Wide field of view: 4 Ã— 6Âº (pupil 76 mm)<br>Detection: 10 km on aircraft<br>Tracking: 7 km on aircraft<br>CCIR output: 25 images/s<br>Resolution: 0.21 mrad (narrow field of view)<br>Max resolution: 200 pts/line Ã— 575 lines<br><br>Fire-control computer<br>Ballistic computation with 3 integrated ballistic switchable<br>Future target calculation<br>Firing sequence and auto tracking<br>Overall aiming accuracy of less than 2 mrad<br>Access for parameters such as wind, ammunition mean point of impact, muzzle velocity and air conditions<br><br>Reflex sight<br>Magnification: Ã—1<br>Field of view:<br>(horizontal) 20Âº min<br>(vertical) 16Âº min<br>Diameter of collimator: 78 mm<br><br>Status<br><br>In production.<br><br>Manufacturer<br><br>Allied Ordnance of Singapore (Pte) Ltd<br></div>
