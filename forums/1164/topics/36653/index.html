            <div class='col-md body'>think the rucksack or the so call field pack is ok. but they can always make some improvements to it.  for example the Israeli armed forces do have a great range of combat vest. they had the vest and the bag pack in one vest.<br><br>the link: <a href="http://www.isayeret.com/vest/recon.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.isayeret.com/vest/recon.htm</a><br><br>but for the saf's new SBO, it seems to follow the us design in terms of appearance, adaptable protection etc... let's jus wait and see when it come out as a standard issue to the whole of saf.<br><br>cheers.[/url]</div>

So they allow for Camelbaks now huh? I rememeber it wasn't that popular 8 years ago. It's a good concept though. we could do away with those two canteens and replace it with pouches to hold additional items.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"></div>

Its like SAW and M203 training...they left that out of BMT now...They should have just kept that in as a part of BMT training...even a simple familiarization course would be good enough.<br><br>I agree with you on the ET tool. This is one thing that we haven't found an alternative for...but it's useful, since the ET stick could be fashioned out of any loose wood or even bamboo in an emergency out in the field. A foldable ET tool won't be able to do that.</div>

But I know they dun ask you to ask full pack and fight. It's not combat effective. They only train you physically with full pack. I'm just complaining about full pack.<br><br>If they ask me to ask full pack and fight, I tell them to train Combat Maid to carry my load. hahahahaha  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"></div>

With modifications to the front pouches,  we could carry 10-12 mags (300-360 rds); that's what my fren did with his SBO. It has been shown that troops would rather carry more ammo than food or water.
