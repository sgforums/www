The policeman and the civilian were given outpatient treatment at the Malacca Hospital.<br><br>Armed with chains, helmets and sticks, the 15-minute rampage began at 8.30pm and was believed to have been triggered by an assault on a soldier on Friday night after an argument with a villager.<br><br>The soldier had apparently rammed his car into the villager's fence. He demanded compensation and the argument escalated into a fight. Other villagers got involved and beat up the soldier.<br><br>The man returned to the village at 2.45am yesterday with several others. Another argument ensued, but the problem was settled without incident.<br><br>However, at 8.30pm yesterday, he returned with 60 others, mostly soldiers, in an army truck, cars and motorcycles, looking for the villagers involved in the earlier argument.<br><br>The mob started smashing windows and doors of a house besides breaking the windscreen of a car parked nearby.<br><br>Houseowner Noraini Adam, 49, said the men arrived at her house and smashed the door and window panes and the windscreen of her husband's car before two of them entered her house.<br><br>"I shouted at them that they were in the wrong house," she said. "Later, they just left ...they did not harm my family." Noraini said the men might have thought someone from her family was involved in the earlier fight as it happened in front of her house.<br><br>Stall owner Supiah Kasan, 39, said: "They were acting like madmen, smashing up everything and chasing people. Those who tried to flee were chased into their homes and also a nearby surau." Supiah said there was panic when two smoke grenades were thrown near the food stall. The rampage lasted about 15 minutes, after which the mob left.<br><br>Malacca Tengah Criminal Investigation Department chief Deputy Superintendent Dennis Lim said police had identified the suspects.<br><br>Police have classified the case under Section 148 of the Penal Code for rioting with weapons. The offence carries a maximum five years' jail or fine or both. Police also recovered spent smoke grenade canisters from the scene.<br><br>The authorities have arranged meetings between the Village Development and Security Committee and the army camp commanders to resolve the dispute.<br><br>Â©New Straits Times (M) Berhad<br><a href="http://" rel="nofollow"></a></div>
