            <div class='col-md body'>Based on my conversations with friends and family members who are regulars, life as a regular in the Army is not the busywork and mindless regimentation of NS. It is a job, much like in a corporation. Specialists are like the foremen on the factory floor, and officers are like the executives and engineers back at the office. Same kind of work, same kind of challenges, same kind of problems. In fact, I think that corporate structure was modelled on the military when the first corporations came into existence. Our SAF is more corporate in culture than most armies, apparently. Less warrior culture. This is not a good thing IMHO.<br><br>You have about the same chance in the SAF of "making a difference" or getting meaningful work as in most large corporations or the government. As an officer, you may get a chance to see in new weapon systems, develop new doctrine or really make a unit "yours", which is not very different from what executives do in a corporation. Not everyone gets the chance, but that is also true in the private sector. As a specialist, you can really make your mark on your unit -- you are the soul and spirit of the army in the end. Again, not that different from corporate life "in the trenches". You get stupid decisions and bad leadership from upstairs in both the army and in the private sector. Signing on is not "zo bo" or a curse as many people seem to think. It's just another job.<br><br>The only differences are that you have to lead a very disciplined and physical life, superiors have more power over subordinates, and the work is dangerous and unusual, which may make finding another job difficult later. If you don't mind these aspects, or you are inspired or attracted by the prospect of defending the country, then signing on might be for you. If you cannot stand passing your IPPT, living under a hundred rules and punishments, being commanded by others, or just don't like the work, don't sign on. Since it is a commitment, signing on for the money is definitely dumb and most who do it for that regret it.</div>
