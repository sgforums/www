            <div class='col-md body'>i recently got to talk to a friend of my in armour, and i asked him about the rumour of the new light tank based on the Bionix chassis... I managed to get some info from him...<br><br>-When I asked him when it would enter service, he said it was already in service. Furthermore, he says that it is the second tank that Mindef will officially admit... which means we should get to hear about it soon...<br><br>-He also confirmed that the main gun is a 120mm. I asked him if the recoil would crack the armour, and he said that it was not such a big problem, since the recoil is quite light.<br><br>-In most other respects, it is similiar to the SM1, with a few changes. Heavier armour, more speed, and a faster autoloader. And quite possibly troop carrying capabilities.<br><br>-Then I asked him about other tanks, and he says that he has driven four. One is the SM1, and the other three he is not allowed to say, otherwise kena caught by MSD...<br><br>-During our conversation, he commented that the Merkava has a poor gas filtration system. When I ask him how he know that, he just winked knowingly.<br><br></div>

All things considered, tanks are actually more mobile then any other type of wheeled unit over rough and soft terrain! The only time the actual weight of the tank comes into play is when it has to cross a bridge or any sort of structure that needs to support it's entire weight, the hardness or softness of the ground has little to do with deploying tanks, for tracks are far better then then wheels...<br><br>One reason why we might not operate MBTs is because of our lack of space. Singapore is not exactly tank country and our needs are probably better fed by having lighter AGS like 120mm systems that are more mobile, fuel effection and aviable in larger numbers.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by Tango1:</div><div class="quote_body">The Israelis lost 2 Merkava IIIs recently in the West Bank/ Gaza strip operations. Seems that they were hit by a command-detonated bomb in an ambush. Of cos', no tanks are invulnerable. The point is, MBTs are vulnerable in a FIBUA situation; and given the terrain  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"> we are operating in, a Bionix light tank variant seems more plausible. Important thing is manoeverability and some decent firepower. Anything better than the SM1s we have now...<br><br>As said, a 120 gun is kinda big. Better a 105 main gun. Like the M551 Sheridans...could even launch Shilegh (sp) AT missiles from it...<br></div></blockquote>105mm rounds might not penetrate PT-91 armour. The 120mm armour piercing rounds are more likely to penetrate most known MBTs. As for against soft targets, even the 75mm rounds used by the SM1 are sufficient.<br><br>Why is there such a big misconception that MBTs are not suitable for FIBUA or any urban scenarios?  In fact, MBTs are great roadblocks and provide good protection for dismounted armoured infantry or foot soldiers. Had the US deployed MBTs in Somalia, we wouldn't have seen such tragic "Black Hawk down" scenarios.<br><br>The Israeli also successfully used their MBTs in the 1980 invasion of Lebanon. The PLO, which only have armed soliders and light vehicles were no match for the Israeli armoured forces. The Israeli also ended up doing tank vs tank fighting against Syrian tanks in Beruit and other Lebanese towns.<br><br>Another reference, watch the mini series, Band of Brothers. You will know the value of tanks in build up areas.</div>
