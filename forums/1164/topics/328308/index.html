              <p>M4 carbine has been a hot topic.Many have agrued if this shall</p>
              <p>be replaced.But no one can decide for US Army,except the wise</p>
              <p>wo/men in US Congress.</p>
              <p>The tone in this recent Congress report sounds not so good,</p>
              <p>right at the very beginning of the Summary:</p>
              <blockquote>The M-4 carbine is the Army’s primary individual combat weapon for infantry<br>units. The M-4 uses a direct gas impingement system that blows carbon from the fired cartridge back into the weapon’s receiver, which can lead to weapon malfunctions.</blockquote>
              <p>Then inside the content:</p>
              <blockquote><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Open Competition for an M-4 Replacement</strong></span>. </blockquote><blockquote>Some small arms analysts have<br>detected “a growing frustration among arms makers that the Army is wedded to a single company.”26 Congress has also asked the Army and DOD to study and report on the feasibility and advisability of conducting an open competition for carbine-type weapons and to develop a long-term, competitive strategy for small arms. If such an effort is undertaken by the Army and the other Services, some might argue that lessons learned  from past Army small arms initiatives such as the Objective Individual Combat Weapon (OICW) program and, more recently, USSOCOM’s Special Operations Combat Assault Rifle (SCAR) program, would facilitate such a competition and procurement.</blockquote>

              <h1 id="story_title">Malaysia has licence to make M4 assault rifles</h1>
              <p>KUALA LUMPUR: Malaysia has a licence to manufacture M4 carbine assault
                  rifles locally and the potential to export them to other countries in
                  the future, said Defence Minister Datuk Seri Najib Tun Razak.</p>
              <p>“We are buying the firearms from the United States but have the licence
                  to produce them now through a local company,” he said yesterday.</p>
              <p>Najib, who is also the Deputy Prime Minister, said they decided to go
                  for the United States-made M4 Carbine as the Steyr rifle had problems
                  because of its limited research and development technology. The Steyrs
                  have been used for 15 years.</p>
              <p>“The M4 Carbines are more suitable, effective and have extra capacity compared with the Steyrs.</p>
              <p>“We took this decision as we want to enable our soldiers to be soldiers
                  of the future, equipped with the latest modern technology,” he said
                  during question time with student leaders after closing the Overseas
                  Umno Club's leadership course.</p>
              <p>The US Congress, he said, had approved the sale of the rifles, which should be delivered in the near future.</p>
              <p>Last year, Najib had presented a letter of intent to SME Ordnance Sdn
                  Bhd (SMEO) for the procurement of 14,000 rifles in a RM70mil deal.</p>
              <p>SMEO had signed a contract with Colt Defence LLC for the weapons.</p>
              <p>While it was not practical to produce all military needs locally, Najib
                  said the country was doing well as it was producing its own Offshore
                  Patrol Vessels and was in the process of producing unmanned aerial
                  vehicles (UAVs) locally.</p>
              <p>“UAVs are the way forward in war
                  tactics and many armies are using them as this will help reduce the
                  number of casualties,” he added.</p>

              <p>I am amazed you even bother to mention this, given this was already known since Vietnam.</p>
              <p>The direct impingement (M-16) system offers far better recoil then a long stroke piston (sar-21) or a similar system, hence offering a weapon using it far better accuracy. FIY, a properly maintained DI system will perform reasonably but it requires more care then a piston system.</p>
              <p>As far as systems go pistons are more practical for the soldier, hence most, if not all of the considered M-16 replacements work on this.</p>

              <p>You mean you learnt nothing from the past few threads on this issue and you even bother to ?</p>
              <p>There has been plenty of improvements to the M4 in the recent decade, the average M4/M16 the grunt uses will outshoot the SAR-21 basic/carbine anyday, with the exception of reliability which is already a long known issue and the reason they want to replace it.</p>
              <p>Do you really want to see what an M4 can be modded to?</p>
              <p><img src="http://i2.photobucket.com/albums/y44/mfingar/M4_Poster_Samplesm.jpg" alt="" width="641" height="852"><a href="http://i2.photobucket.com/albums/y44/mfingar/M4_Poster_Samplesm.jpg"></a></p>
              <p>How many improvements in the SAR-21 over the past 9 years since 1999? How come the Israelis can come up with so much stuff for their Tavor and we're still messing around with the SAR-21 basic for our troops which has some serious issues like night fighting reliance on the LAD?</p>
              <p>Once again you need to be reminded, but I suspect that you simply do not want to learn this fact simply because you are too stubborn to accept this, is that the yanks could easily switch to some other weapon back then like the SCAR, the XM8 or what have you not but the simple reason they have held out for so long was because they are waiting for something truly revolutionary to replace their legacy systems when the technology matures with as opposed to simply switching to something that is just slightly better.</p>
              <p>And of course there's the piston M4/M16 as well that solves the reliablity issues and makes it as reliable as ARs like the SAR-21, but at the expense of accuracy.</p>

              <p>How come you seem to learn nothing at all? Bad memory or just plain stubborn?</p>
              <p>I suggest you get more creative when trying to find new topics to pinpoint. In  fact you are becoming amusing, you seem to be mostly incapable of posting a decent and honest topic in any forum electing instead to post just about everything in the "what's wrong with this country/military" vein filled with shallow and childish questions that could be answered with a bit of common sense, not to mention having absolutely no effect on whatever country or military you have targeted. It is a style that is repeated, old and boring, and the fun in these topics usually come from how badly you get owned.</p>
              <p>And funnier you reuse your old and debunked arguments again a while after your defeat, thinking that apparently they will work this time.</p>

              <p>You cannot attach the range of accessories that are available to M4 to other rifles such as SAR-21 unless the rifle is modified accordingly to accept these. However, the M4 has evolved over the years (  due  to  the US military's needs thru combat experience )  to the current situation where an M4 can be tailored to suit the various combat situations.   </p>
              <p>There is no rifle system that I know of that can give the user such a wide range of accesories.</p>
              <p>I think M4s with scopes are only issued to front line combat soldiers. Ordinary soldiers still get M16s &amp; not M4s -   someone please confirm.     </p>

              <p>I think M4s with scopes are only issued to front line combat soldiers. Ordinary soldiers still get M16s &amp; not M4s -   someone please confirm.    </p>
              </blockquote>
              <p>I don't know who gave anybody the idea that the US military only uses M4s across the board when most of the ordinary grunts use the M16. But they are basically the same thing save for the fact that M16 shoots further and hits harder.</p>
              <p>As for scopes, it depends on where you are, but the idea is to get the good stuff to the front lines.</p>
              <blockquote>
              <p>Can someone advice on the basic M4 issued to the ordinary soldiers of US - i don't think they come with any scope even.</p>
              </blockquote>
              <p>Depends on their unit, but the push is towards modular mounting systems. The ordinary US Marine certainly gets far better sights then the ordinary SAF soldier gets with the SAR-21.</p>
              <p>The USMC uses the M16A4, which is a modular system as well, and the US Army using that for some of it's units as well.</p>
              <p>Here are examples of what the ordinary US troops in Iraq are using:</p>

              <p>Officials with Project Manager Soldier Weapons solicited the
              small-arms industry seeking "the state of the art in small arms
              technologies" for soldiers.</p>

              <p>The "request for information" is the first step toward a
              carbine competition the Army intends to open next year after Colt
              Defense LLC, the company that makes the M4, turns over the weapon's
              technical data rights in June 2009.</p>
              <p>That gives the Army a chance to make major design changes in the M4 or select a different weapon.</p>
              <p>"We
              want to make sure we know what's out there" said Col. Douglas Tamilio,
              who runs PM Soldier Weapons. "The door is wide open for any type of
              system."</p>
              <p>If all goes as planned, the Army will release a request
              for proposals late next summer, formally inviting weapons makers to
              submit plans and prototype weapons for testing, said Maj. Tom Henthorn,
              small-arms branch chief for Soldier Requirements Division at Fort
              Benning, Ga.</p>
