              <p><img src="http://mili.co.kr/infantry/servedweapon/be/2000/f2000_3.jpg" alt=""></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>One of the modules developed for the F2000 system is a proprietary lightweight 40 mm under-slung GL1 grenade launcher (empty weight – 1 kg) that uses standard low-velocity <a title="40 mm grenade" href="/wiki/40_mm_grenade"><span style="color: #002bb8;">40x46mm</span></a> grenades. The launcher is a single-shot breech-loaded <a title="Pump-action" href="/wiki/Pump-action"><span style="color: #002bb8;">pump-action</span></a> weapon with a barrel that slides forward for loading and unloading (like the <a title="M203 grenade launcher" href="/wiki/M203_grenade_launcher"><span style="color: #002bb8;">M203 grenade launcher</span></a>), locked by axial rotation of the barrel.</p>
              <p>The weapon’s trigger was installed directly under the F2000's trigger so that it can be manipulated without removing the shooting hand from the rifle’s pistol grip. The breech release button is found on the left side of the launcher body, like on the M203. The grenade launcher barrel length is 230 mm (9.1 in). <strong><span style="color: #ff0000;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">The grenade launcher comes with a basic flip-up ladder sight, but it was intended to be used with a specially-designed optoelectronic fire control system designated FCS, developed in cooperation with the </span></span></strong><a title="Finland" href="/wiki/Finland"><span style="color: #002bb8;"><strong><span style="color: #ff0000;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Finnish</span></span></strong></span></a><strong><span style="color: #ff0000;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"> company Noptel. The aiming module is installed in place of the standard optical sight and becomes the weapon’s primary sight when mounted, but its main purpose is to accurately determine and indicate the range of a grenade target. The module is powered by a 9 V battery pack, installed in the stock, behind the magazine well. The power pack is also intended to power any other tactical accessories or systems that could be introduced.</span></span></strong></p>
              <p style="margin-left: 72pt;"><a rel="nofollow" href="http://i132.photobucket.com/albums/q35/flex297/Night%20Vision%20Gear/f2000_sr.jpg"><img src="http://i132.photobucket.com/albums/q35/flex297/Night%20Vision%20Gear/f2000_sr.jpg" alt="" width="288" height="265"></a><br><a rel="nofollow" href="http://i132.photobucket.com/albums/q35/flex297/Night%20Vision%20Gear/f2000_sg.jpg"><img src="http://i132.photobucket.com/albums/q35/flex297/Night%20Vision%20Gear/f2000_sg.jpg" alt="" width="288" height="263"></a></p>
              <p><strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">The FCS integrates a low-power laser rangefinder (precise to within +/- 1 m), a day-time aiming channel with an electronically projected reticle, a measured range display reading and a diode elevation adjustment indicator. The fire control system calculates a firing solution manifested by the barrel’s angle of elevation using target range information from the laser rangefinder (the rangefinder is activated by pushing a button on the pistol grip, below the trigger), corrected manually by the shooter through a push-button interface (add/subtract buttons) on the FCS top cover to take account for head or tail winds that could affect the desired range. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">The F2000 FCS also contains software with the ballistic properties of up to six types of 40 mm grenades and can be reprogrammed to take advantage of future munition improvements.</span></span></strong></p>

              <p>Also you haven't answered all these issues lionnoisy....</p>
              <p>The SSW uses a 5.7mm PDW module as it's KE module, which is vastly inferior in range, accuracy, and stopping power to the full sized 5.56mm KE modules of most other ABM packages.</p>
              <p>Additionally the SSW is not modular.</p>
              <p>Additionally in the event of running out of 40mm ammo, or facing situtations 40mm is overkill or not needed, the SSW is unable to serve as a normal direct fire weapon on par with the rest of the weapons in the section or platoon.</p>
              <p>Now you see why most companies working on the concept still want to stick with a full sized rifle? You think they are stupid or idiotic and didn't consider the PWD concept?</p>
              <p>A bigger issue, what role exactly does the SSW fill? If put into a section supposedly to replace the SAR-21 GL, you lose the rifle ability the SAR-21 GL gives you in favour of a semiautomatic grenade launcher</p>
              <p>If you put it in platoon level, one wonders why not just use a 3GL SAR-21? Which is still useful as a rifle or just switch to an ultra lightweight AGL altogether that can give you sustained 40mm ABM fire instead of just a limited magazine?</p>
              <p>Is the SSW innovative?</p>
              <p>Nope.</p>
              <p>It's a fixed concept with serious compromises.</p>
              <p>What is a innovative concept?</p>
              <p>The IMI MPRS would be an example, a small, 600gram package that affords the capacity to use advanced munitions to any modern rifle or future modular weapons. In fact, anything that can accept a P-rail can accept the MPRS.</p>
              <p>ADDITIONALLY, the MPRS is not just a ABM grenade sight, it is also an advanced sighting system that can be used with the normal, direct fire mode.</p>

              <blockquote>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: x-small;">In a briefing at Eurosatory show in
              Paris last week, the head of the U.S. Army’s Program Executive Office
              Soldier, Brig. Gen. Mark Brown, wasn’t exactly bubbling with enthusiasm
              when discussing the Army’s Colt-manufactured M4 carbine, though he
              tempered his skepticism of the gun with enough praise to soften the
              edges. <span> </span></span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: x-small;">“Right
              now the M4 carbine is a world class weapon,” he said, before adding,
              “my personal opinion is that we have to step up to a new carbine with a
              more lethal round.” It was an interesting admission on Brown’s part,
              since some have criticized the M4’s 5.56 round as not having enough
              stopping power, and its habit of jamming if not constantly cleaned.
              This comes in the context of a wider debate over the future of the M4
              as the Army’s carbine of choice, especially since many people,
              including the Delta Force and SEAL’s, have been <a href="http://www.armytimes.com/news/2007/02/atCarbine070219/">singing the praises</a> of the Heckler &amp; Koch 416 carbine. BG Brown surely knows this, which is probably why he followed up with this:<br></span></p>
              <blockquote>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: x-small;">“I
              don’t think we need an unhealthy, discordant debate over the current
              carbine because I don’t think the current carbine is a long-lived
              solution anyway. However, the M4 carbine has been continuously
              improved. It has 68 substantial engineering design changes and about
              380 total engineering design changes, so it’s become a modular system.
              It’s very accurate, it’s the most accurate of the carbines, it’s the
              lightest of the carbines, and it’s the shortest of the carbines. We’re
              very pleased with it, and we expect it to be the Army’s carbine of
              record, for a little while.” </span></p>

              <span class="lingo_region">
              <p><img src="http://www.defensetech.org/images/industry-day.jpg" alt="industry-day.jpg" width="300" height="199" align="left"></p>
              <p>I know it's a bit late, but I got my hands on some material that came out of the <a href="http://www.military.com/news/article/army-news/army-looks-for-possible-followon-to-m4.html">mid-November "industry day"</a> held in the DC area to show the Army what's out there to replace the M4.</p>
              <p>You'll remember <a href="http://www.defensetech.org/archives/004425.html#comments">that the service has indicated it's finally willing to explore updated options to its standard-issue service rifle</a>...now
              the M4. Whether you think the M4 sucks or not, it makes sense that the
              Army is breaking free of its single-minded love affair with the M16 and
              its variants.</p>
              <p>I missed the industry day (dumb me) but I got a write-up on the
              meeting from a renowned weapons expert that many of you might know. He
              did not send this directly to me, I obtained it through other sources,
              so I'm going to protect its origins and the author.</p>
              <p>According to the expert, "19 vendors showed up at the industry day,
              including Polytech, KAC, Precision Reflex, POF, S&amp;W, FN with SCAR,
              Superior Tooling, AAI with LSAT, LWRC, Colt Defense, Barrett, Sabre
              Defense, Armwest, HK, Bushmater/Remington, Robinson Armament, Troy
              Industries and SIG Sauer." Army secretary Pete Geren showed up as well,
              along with key players from PEO Soldier and PEO Soldier Weapons.
              According to one of my sources, fortunately some congressional staffers
              from top lawmakers who want to take up this issue also showed,
              including staffers for Salazar, Hutchison, Sessions and John Warner
              (though we know he's retiring soon).</p>
              <p>The weapons expert said:</p>
              <blockquote>
              <p>Lots of AR-based systems on display, mostly off the shelf items,
              many op rod guns and conversions. A few medium caliber (6.5G and 6.8
              Rem SPC and 7.62x39mm R) platforms on display and a few 7.62x51mm
              systems as well. No bullpups (Tavor, AUG or F2000)surprisingly and no
              XM8. Lots of discussion about op rod upgrades to M4's versus complete
              new systems. Little talk that I heard anyway about user convertible

              one or two such systems there.</p>

              <p>One thing my source told me -- and yes, he does have a stake in the
              adoption of a new rifle -- was that Geren's presence, while adding
              senior-level gravitas to the event, was essentially meaningless because
              he's probably going to leave in 60 days. And the fact that neither the
              service chief nor vice chief showed up at the event sent a signal the
              the uniformed leadership isn't on board with the idea and could
              recommend to the next secretary that they abandon the effort.</p>
              <p>Here's more from the debrief:</p>
              <blockquote>
              <p>Industry reps I spoke with were cautiously optimistic having been
              burned a time or two before in the last 10 years. A major difference
              here is the presence of a formal requirements document (CDD) as per the
              JCIDs process that is due to be completed and staffed by the end of
              CY08 and expected to be approved by summer CY09 with possible draft RFQ
              release to industry for comment w/i 4QFY09 (and a second Industry Day)
              and eventual final RFP release by Sept. 2009; all this as per COL
              Tamilio's (new PM-SW formerly from the REF) briefing to the attendees.
              Each vendor was allotted 30 minutes to present to a US Govt team in
              private. Lots of new faces within the "small arms system" to include a
              new PEO Soldier, PM-SW and PM-SW IW and USAIC reps....</p>
              <p>This process of consulting industry in support of a real fair and
              open competition for the next service rifle has not occurred in more
              than 70 years, likely since the M1 Garand "competition" prior to WWII.
              This was a historic day! Lots of oversight on this one from the real
              end user side and at senior leadership levels. We are on the right
              track finally. Lets just hope it doesn't get derailed with changes in
              the US Govt over the next 2 months. Time will tell. Keep the pressure
              on!</p>

              <p><em>Each company was given equal space to display their weapons at the
              event. Congressional aides and reporters were given a strict 60-minute
              window in the morning to talk to gun makers and handle weapons before
              being asked to leave. The rest of the day was consumed with
              participants making 30-minute presentations to Army officials as well
              as representatives from the Air Force, Navy and Marine Corps.</em></p>
              <p><em>Many companies have been preparing for this opportunity for years.</em></p>
              <p><em>Smith
              &amp; Wesson, a company founded 156 years ago, made a dramatic shift
              three years ago with its decision to go after the military market, said
              Joe Bergeron, a defense product manager for the company.</em></p>
              <p><em>“Over
              the past three years, we have invested more than $50 million in
              facilities,” he said, describing Smith &amp; Wesson’s three
              manufacturing sites in the United States.</em></p>
              <p><em>“We saw a need for the
              rifle,” he said. The company has developed a line of M4-style weapons
              that feature a gas port that’s positioned mid-length along the barrel.
              This midlength system helps reduce some of the port pressure, “allowing
              the gun to run a little cooler and cleaner,” he said.</em></p>
              <p><em>Bushmaster/Remington officials were showing off their Adaptive Combat Rifle.</em></p>
              <p><em>The
              weapon features a gas piston operating system, tool-less quick change
              barrels and a multi-adjustable folding stock. It was created and first
              unveiled as the Masada in 2007 by Magpul Industries of Boulder, Colo.
              Magpul is best known for inventing a molded-plastic magazine attachment
              that helps combat troops perform speedy magazine changes.</em></p>
              <p><em>Since then, Magpul signed a deal with the larger Bushmaster to produce and market it as the ACR.</em></p>
              <p><em>LWRC International LLC displayed several of its piston gas system carbines that are available in multiple calibers.</em></p>
              <p><em>The company’s M6A2PSD is chambered for 6.8mm and features an eight-inch barrel.</em></p>
              <p><em>“That
              eight-inch barrel, 6.8mm — in that tight little package — is delivering
              more velocity and a bigger bullet than a 14.5-inch M4 is,” said Dave
              Hall, LWRC consultant with a special operations background.</em></p>
              <p><em>FNH USA displayed both the 5.56mm and 7.62mm versions of its SCAR as well as a conversion kit to adapt the weapon to 6.8mm.</em></p>
              <p><em>“It’s
              an open architecture design; if they want a different bell or whistle,
              we can put it on or take it off,” said Gabe Bailey of FNH USA. “If they
              don’t want a feature like a selector level; if they don’t want the butt
              stock to fold we have a non-folding stock.”</em></p>
              <p><em>The company hopes to
              start delivering low-rate initial production SCARs to Special
              Operations Command by January, Bailey said. In addition to SCAR, FNH
              USA makes the Army’s M2 and M240 machine guns and the M249 squad
              automatic weapon.</em></p>
              <p><em>Some gun company representatives said they were skeptical about this latest effort given the Army’s track record.</em></p>
              <p><em>From
              2002 to 2005, the service developed the XM8 as a replacement for the
              conventional Army’s M16 family. The $33 million program led to
              infighting in the service’s weapons community and eventually died after
              failing to win approval at the Defense Department level.</em></p>
              <p><em>The XM8 was a spinoff of an older Army program called Objective Individual Combat Weapon.</em></p>
              <p><em>Started
              in 1994, the OICW program featured the XM29, which combined a 5.56mm
              carbine with a 20mm airburst weapon to maximize ground soldier
              firepower. But after a decade, development had stalled in the face of
              technical challenges that made the weapon too heavy and bulky.</em></p>
              <p><em>Together the XM29 and the XM8 ended up costing the Army <span style="color: #ff0000;">$100 million</span>.</em></p>
              <p><em>Still, participants of the industry day said they were pleased the Army took this step.</em></p>
              <p><em>“I
              think this is a wonderful opportunity for the soldiers; it will give a
              whole industry a chance to give some input into updating the” M4, said
              David Dunlap, president of Precision Reflex Inc. “The weapon is a good
              weapon, but it does need updating.”</em></p>
              <p><em>But there was also an
              undercurrent of skepticism by many small-company officials who wondered
              if the Army’s process would treat them fairly and not favor larger
              small-arms companies the service has dealt with in the past, said
              several individuals who asked not to be identified for fear of
              retribution.</em></p>
              <p><em>When asked about this concern, PEO soldier commander
              Brig. Gen. Peter Fuller said “it’s better to be fair like this through
              the whole process. We are going to have another industry day; we have
              the big guys, but we want to see more small guys because small guys can
              come up with these great new and innovative ways to deal with things.”---end of quote</em></p>
