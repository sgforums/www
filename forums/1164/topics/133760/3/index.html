            <div class='col-md body'>Seriously, the E2C is used for much more specific operation area. They are also critical to any beyond visual range engagements by our Amraam. Any aerial attack force on Singapore may not be detected by the E2C.<br><br>The key to the aerial defence of Singapore is our Air Traffic Control area of operation. Singapore has been allocated the role of controlling the air traffic of the entire South East Asia by the FAA in the 1980s, the Malaysians were making a lot of noise about that. In fact, the air search capability the Civil Aviation Authority of Singapore has allows the detection of aircraft as far as Australia. Yep, you read me correct. Our ground radars and E2C have more specific war time purposes, thats why they are the mobile versions. In case the Malaysians detroy CAAS radar stations.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Wow, interesting subject here.  I guess when they meant 800km, they are just stating the ability TO BE ABLE to cover 800km if needed to.  Whether its wise or not is another question.<br><br>I believe there is a sortie profile called HAVCAP, to protect the High Value assets such as AEWs.  The cool thing about AEWs, is that u  cant really sneak up on one.   Though u may figure out where one may be, how to approach without getting spotted by the AEW is the tricky part.  Unless u got some really nifty toys such as F-22s.<br><br>So u dont' really NEED to have planes patrolling Around the AEW in order to protect it.  Just make sure the nearest airbase has fighters ready to scramble to protect it.<br><br>But of course, if the AEW is operating near to the front, it would be wise to have rotating flights of HAVCAP sorties planned out.<br><br>Nothing classified here, just speaking from my hours of playing Falcon 4 SP3.</div>

Now in production transition, this new marque is the umbrella term for a package of parallel improvements to the Group II baseline encompassing a Mission Computer Upgrade (MCU), introduction of the Advanced Control Indicator Set (ACIS) display suite, fully integrated UHF satellite communications (satcom), a vapour cycle upgrade and addition of the Cooperative Engagement Capability (CEC). Taken together, these various enhancements will enable significant improvements in data management, system throughput, operator interface, connectivity and situational awareness. Initial operating capability (with CEC) is scheduled for 2003.<br><br>The introduction of the MCU/ACIS fit, as a precursor to the full Hawkeye 2000 mission fit, is significant in that it provides for the transition of the mission system to a new open architecture based on industry-standard backplane technology. Based on the Raytheon Model 940 computer, a modification of the DEC 2100 processing system, the MCU offers orders of magnitude of extra memory and throughput in comparison to the legacy L-304 computer. Based on industry-standard VME/PCI technology, it is approximately one-third the weight and less than half the volume of its predecessor, freeing up space and weight for other new equipments. </blockquote>fr <a href="http://www.janes.com/defence/naval_forces/news/jni/jni010126_1_n.shtml" rel="nofollow">http://www.janes.com/defence/naval_forces/news/jni/jni010126_1_n.shtml</a><br></div>
