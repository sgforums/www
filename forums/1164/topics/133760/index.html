            <div class='col-md body'>Sorry if I offend anyone...<br>Radar are used to compile picture for the warfare officers to plan stretegies, attacks, detection etc...<br>Radar cannot kill enemy, maybe it can kill their sperm if they are near and transmitting at very high power.<br>Even if E2C are at the edge of FPS117 max range and itself provides radar pictures and combine with FPS117 picture, it is still picture. We still need striking capability and attack force if you wanna detect and kill enemy at that far range.<br>In time of crisis or war, I dun think SAF will deploy E2C till that far out, maybe not into enemy territory or malacca straits. Maybe they will deploy up north at south china sea. As if they were deploy at that far range, they becomes very vulnerable to attacks by enemy airstrike and reinforcement may come too late.<br>In south China Sea it's different, the area are large, our RSN ships can co-ordinate with the airboys...<br><br>Furthermore, radar is a radar. A radar will inevitably only shows radar echos or radar bleeps. But you wont know what the contact is. You will need ESM ultimately. Finally I dun think our ESM system are that great that can help out to detect contacts at that far range.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>E2C or any airborne radar are considered High Value Assets (HVU). You NEVER place them at the front line. So you can't add 400+360=800km. Airborne radars are mainly to supplement the air picture, to pick up low flying aircraft that may not be picked up by ground-based radars. To put them in front is total suicide, unless you say the adversary has no air-threat.<br>So think again..</div>

Generally, the E-2 will fly just above our head or the furthest South China Sea where it quite difficult to "ambush".  Their main purpose is to paint a better picture and C&amp;C of air asset in the theatre.  We will have a general air coverage over the area but not  dedicated F-16s around E-2C.  Our fighter jokeys also don't want their balls to get cook by the radiation.   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"></div>
