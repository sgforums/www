            <div class='col-md body'><img src="http://www.ultimak.com/gallery/USArmyLTC.jpg"><br><br>LTC Arnold is holding what he calls his "AK-48" (a Hungarian AKM). It's equipped with a slant brake, the UltiMAK M1-B optic mount with EOTech HWS (Holographic Weapon Sight), American AKBSW(H) synthetic stock, and an ARG-B M-16 style pistol grip. Why, you might ask, are American military and security personnel using AKs? We've asked quite a few of them about that, and we repeatedly get an answer similar to what Mr. Arnold told us;<br><br>"When I first learned of our pending deployment, I was the XO for a tank battalion. We all carried M-4s and 9 mms. I was promoted to LTC and therefore transferred out of my XO slot and up to Brigade headquarters. No M-4s there, only M-16s. The M-16/M-4 is an excellent weapon but I wanted something with "punch" to it. Something that left an impression. I went to a shotgun initially, since I assumed we were going to be in an urban setting. Nothing like OO buck or slugs when kicking in a door. As it turned out we ended up here at LSA Anaconda, a more rural setting, requiring longer shots (100-1000 meters). Certainly farther than a 12 gauge was going to shoot. I was also given command of an 896 man Iraqi National Guard Battalion (ING), whose primary weapons are AK-47s. When I attempted to exchange my shotgun for an M-16, I was told there were none remaining. So out of curiosity, I picked up one of the ING AKs and gave it a try. I liked the way it shot, as well as the 7.62 vs. 5.56 round. Initially I disliked the short butt stock, but after a few "encounters" began to appreciate it. Its far easier to shoulder rapidly with all of our gear on. My AK has grown on me as we've fought together over here and I would very much like to take it home with me. I'm not sure if that will be authorized yet but we'll see..."<br><br><img src="http://www.ultimak.com/gallery/WinningTeam.jpg"><br>UltiMAK in service "across the pond".

            <div class='col-md body'>The AK will always be a good idiot-proof weapon that can put out impressive amounts of firepower, that's good in a brawl. But imagine trying to carry a 1.5 contact rate of 7.62mm, and when the firefight becomes more tatical and at moderate range, the AK suffers somewhat against "finer" firearms because of it's lower accuracy and heftier weight, which is no problem for armed forces who rely on brute strength, rather then tatics to win the day.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Yup,agreed that the AK47 is heavier and the 7.62 rounds are also heavier.It all depends on what is the user looking for.High rate of fire,lightweight and precise weapon,there you have the M16.If you are looking for a weapon which allows for the hard hitting power,more stable and reliabilty in what ever conditions and idiot-proof not to mention produced cheaply,then you have the AK47.<br><br>Lastly,its must be noted that Soviet weapons regardeless whatever type,are built for one purpose, reliabilty.While western/american weapons regardless of type are built for precision.Thus they tend to lack in terms of reliability under rough conditions.</div>
