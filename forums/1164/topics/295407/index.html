I think they were only brought out as a last resort weapon. Like the flamethrower. It's probably when they think the defence is gonna be stubborn then they'll bring out the WP and flamethrower.<br><br>I read that thermite grenades were often used in Korea to disable arty pieces to prevent enemy capturing them intact.</div>

Which makes the SFG more useful, which is why it is the standard issue among troops.<br><br>The WP is more of a terror weapon. The phosphrous is like molten lava and burns into flesh upon contact.

            <div class='col-md body'>White Phosphorus (WP)<br>White Phosphorus (WP), known as Willy Pete, is used for signaling, screening, and incendiary purposes. White Phosphorus can be used to destroy the enemy's equipment or to limit his vision. It is used against vehicles, petroleum, oils and lubricants (POL) and ammunition storage areas, and enemy observers. WP can be used as an aid in target location and navigation. It is usually dispersed by explosive munitions. It can be fired with fuze time to obtain an airburst. White phosphorus was used most often during World War II in military formulations for smoke screens, marker shells, incendiaries, hand grenades, smoke markers, colored flares, and tracer bullets.<br><br>The Battle of Fallujah was conducted from 8 to 20 November 2004 with the last fire mission on 17 November. The battle was fought by an Army, Marine and Iraqi force of about 15,000 under the I Marine Expeditionary Force (IMEF). US forces found WP to be useful in the Battle of Fallujah. "WP proved to be an effective and versatile munition. We used it for screening missions at two breeches and, later in the fight, as a potent psychological weapon against the insurgents in trench lines and spider holes when we could not get effects on them with HE. We fired Â“shake and bakeÂ” missions at the insurgents, using WP to flush them out and HE to take them out. ... We used improved WP for screening missions when HC smoke would have been more effective and saved our WP for lethal missions."<br><br>White phosphorus is not banned by any treaty to which the United States is a signatory. Smokes and obscurants comprise a category of materials that are not used militarily as direct chemical agents. The United States retains its ability to employ incendiaries to hold high-priority military targets at risk in a manner consistent with the principle of proportionality that governs the use of all weapons under existing law. The use of white phosphorus or fuel air explosives are not prohibited or restricted by Protocol II of the Certain Conventional Weapons Convention (CCWC), the Convention on Prohibitions or Restrictions on the Use of Certain Conventional Weapons which may be Deemed to be Excessively Injurious or to have Indiscriminate Effects.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hand grenade must be employed in careful manner after the environment has been assessed.<br><br>In a book that I read about the British SAS training for deployment in Malayan jungle during the Confrontation, a British officer lost one eyes after throwing a frag grenade in a jungle setting.  The grenade rebound off branches...lost one eye.  Undaunted, he tried the same foolish move again after discharge from hospital.  Guess what, lost his remaining eye; blind in both eyes.<br><br>Morale of the story, don't anyhow throw grenade.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I think my encounter as a safety NCO is not the first and last time that such careless handling of M203 happened in SAF or any other army.  Some lessons have to be learnt the hard and embarrassing way to sink in.  So, maybe that why rifle sling was not stipulated to be removed during tactical live firing. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_redface.gif" alt="Embarassed" title="Embarassed"><br><br>Some soldiers are just a hazard to themselves and others.  You know what I meant. (Maybe, we should start a new thread on such soldiers  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"> ) But then again, the true quality of a soldier is assessable only under the baptism of real operation with live ammo exchanged with enemy.  They may not be switch-on during training but when live, duty, honor and etc are at stake, they may be more enthusiastic and collected than any of us blogging here.  Until such time, I reserve my judgement on fellow soldiers.</div>
