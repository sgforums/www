Another oft quoted story about their skill was during an encounter during WWI or Burma campaign, in a bayonet duel between German/Jap solider, ghurka jump aside after geeting first swipe, enemy said "Ha! you missed". Ghurka said "try shaking your head", which the enemy did and his head fell off. (more lilkely to be another urban legend).<br><br>True story:<br>During WWII in the midst of the British retreat from Japanese conquest of Burma, a vickers MG team (heavy watercooled MG with crew of 4) was being manhandled with great effort even though there was almost no more ammo to supply the weapon.<br><br>While crossing a river on a makeshift raft, the raft started to break apart and rapidly sank. Naturally everyone swam to shore except the MG gunner. They thought he drowned (as Ghurkas are poor swimmers). Upon diving into the murky depths they found him still struggling to swim from the bottom clutching his MG. Upon rescue, they ask him what happened. His reply that he didn't want to disobey his orders not to abandoned his weapon.<br><br>This is a true story which show their dedication to orders and bravery to carry out their duty.</div>

While we do have small units like SOF, the SAF doesn't have an all-regular force on the scale of the Gurkha contingent.<br><br>And yes, they're bloody fit.  The way they run up hills, I'd swear they were part mountain goat.<br><br>That said, our lads from SOF are easily up to par with the Gurkhas on a man-to-man level.  Unless Meculo happens to also know many of our force line lads on a first-name basis, I wouldn't take his opinion too seriously.<br><br>Ultimately, it comes down to professionalism, which Gurkhas are renowned for.  Whenever our guys bumped into the Gurkhas in Changi, there was mutual respect, and that's what I liked most about them.</div></blockquote>oh..we do have a all-regular force battalion exist in SAF rite now...<br>but compare fitness with the Gurkhas of cos cannot fight...</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I think their great fitness comes from living at altitude, so they are well acclimated and then when they come to sea level, their fitness level is even greater.  Also, they probably don't have cars or other forms of public transportation there, so they have to go everywhere on foot.  Just like the Kenyans and why they are so good at long distance running.  I believe for the Indian and British Army recruiting, they have to walk for days from their village to Kathmandu.<br><br>I wonder if the SPF Gurkhas have the same level of competency as the British Army Gurkhas.  Just because they come from Nepal doesn't mean they are as skilled.  Granted they might have many natural attributes, but how much of those are enhanced by the training makes them the fearsome waririors they are.  Perhaps the SPF Gurkhas are all reputation with no real substance like their counterparts in the British Army.</div>
