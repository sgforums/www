Just because they come from Nepal doesn't mean they are as skilled.  Granted they might have many natural attributes, but how much of those are enhanced by the training makes them the fearsome waririors they are.  Perhaps the SPF Gurkhas are all reputation with no real substance like their counterparts in the British Army. [/b]</blockquote>Hmm....you took down a few before over here?</div>

Not SAF. However, their establishment dosent seem to move with the times as SPF does. Not only are they still wearing the early generation police uniforms (other then the hat, of coz), they dont seem to be having the intention of abolishing the Constable and LCP ranks in line with the rest of the SPF as well, amongst other things.<br><br>And yes, they continue to be commandered under the Ang Mos employed by the sg govt.</div>
