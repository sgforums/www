Not that I know of many such cases happening nowadays expecially pertaining to the "kill" part....the last time it happened to a police officer was way back in 1991 at Tampines (it was, however, snatch before kill...not the other way round. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy">). Then again there is also a case of a Cisco guard who was murdered with his own gun last year if you guys recall....but that isnt really a snatching case.<br><br>But as for suicide cases, sadly, it does happen a tad too often I suppose. Only recently there was a young Cisco plasting his brains out at Tuas Checkpoint? Now is actually quite a lull period. Last year got one SATS police. Year 2002 got 3 cases (2 police, 1 CISCO....yeah the one involving the DXO), dunno how many in 2001, but another 3 cases in 2000....<br><br>And those were only the reported cases.

I also dont think airsoft products (or firearms in general) should be selling in my neighbourhood store downstairs. Call me selfish, but I want to go on my rounds knowing I have a firearm in case of an emergency, and not having to worry that at the next turn, an air pellet might somehow find its way through my eyes and brains, or a metal slug through my heart.</div>
