S'pore's image is a society that is straitjacketed by its government! Foreign talents are not attracted to stay here at all because they say it's a BORING place! We are nowhere near a cosmopolitan city that the government is trying to be... why u think they allow bar-top dancing? supposedly that activity is unnecesary and potentially dangerous too...<br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>I hate to say this, but you're one of those still living in the 20th century thinking within the box and stifling our growth as a mature nation...  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_confused.gif" alt="Confused" title="Confused"><br><br>You dun have to keep trying to convince me the problem of airsoft, it's not like i dun know the government's stand or the implication of allowing airsoft...<br><br>Anyway, if i ever laid my hands on one, i'll probably enjoy it in the privacy of my room....

(better yet, the wife was a DXO).<br>Several years back, there was a case of a officer got shot by his gf, because he allowed his gf to play with his gun. Oops. It was loaded that time. just once.<br><br>Lastly, we have several years back, another officer who ran amok right here in yishun. It was a VERY MAJOR piece of news back then.<br><br>And of course, from time to time, we have one or two criminals who manage to knock out/kill a officer and take their sidearm.<br><br>Pile all these cases together, and are there people in singapore who are legally holding guns at home? yes.<br><br>And for those in the know, a certain permit issued by a certain agency allows you to have a firearm. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"></div>

So much for the image fo S'pore...  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_sad.gif" alt="Sad" title="Sad"><br><br>You must understand a good government MUST always move along the spectrum of strong intervention towards lasseiz-fare as the nation and its citizens mature, it cannot remain stuck to one end of the spectrum... It stifles growth...<br><br>Society immature (Strong government control to maintain order)<br>i<br>i<br>i<br>i<br>i<br>i<br>i<br>i<br>i<br>Society matures (Government loosens control to allow civil society to flourish)<br><br>If there is a strong government presence all the time, citizens will never learn how to be responsible and b highly dependent on the government... like what you said.... Ppl complaining why government is not doing enough when it has already done so much... S'pore society will always remain immature...<br><br>LKY said he was very impressed when he went UK that people are very civilised and just put their coins and take the newspaper, no one steals them... It's because their government has learn to let go and allows its citizens to mature... In S'pore, the moment there is no law or when ppl think they can get away with it, they'll speed, spit and litter like nobody's business... Why? because they've not been educated to be responsible, they know there's the government to clear up for them and they just have to ensure they're not caught and fine...<br><br>It's like raising a child, once he grows up, the parent will slowly loosen control, let him make mistake and learn to be mature and responsible... A parent who is always controlling a child will end up having a irresponsible kid who will commit offences the moment there is no adult presence...  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_neutral.gif" alt="Neutral" title="Neutral"><br><br>Okie, You sound like a policeman and I can understand your main concern is order, not growth... you've made your point that S'pore is still a very immature society that is not ready to accept activities like airsoft... I cannot argue with that, but i'm deeply sadden by this...  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cry.gif" alt="Crying or Very sad" title="Crying or Very sad"> My question is, HOW and WHEN will S'pore be ready?</div>
