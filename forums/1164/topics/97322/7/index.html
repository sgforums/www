            <div class='col-md body'><strong>hey guys guess wat i found this on yahoo auctions<br><br>&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>Will be selling information in a form of a map on where exactly in singapore you can get airsoft, be it a small pistol or big machine gun.(single clocking or semi/full auto). Photo 1 is one of those you can get for only S$30(M16/A4 Submachine gun-Single Clocking). Photo 2 is one of those you can get for only S$60(D-90F Machine gun-Semi/full auto). Photo 3 is one of those pistol that comes with an attachement that allows you to fix a red-dot sight and a laser pointer(which are also included together with the silencer)for the price of only S$20.(Single clocking) Depending on what stocks arrive, you can have a vast range of airsoft that cost between S$5(small single clocking pistol) to S$60(semi/full auto machine guns). Though these items are made in china, they provide the same power capacity and near looks as though of brands like TOKYO MARUI. For the one time price you pay for this information, you will be one who can fulfil your fantasy of owning a full range of airsoft guns(Price is negotiatable). Feel free to email me for any quiries. Thank you. Hi there, due to the fact that i have to redo the whole auction again cos someone bid or bought, resulting in the closure of it, pleaseeeee do not bid ok? You can always email mi at airsoft_4241@yahoo.com.sg Thanks! This is to answer some curious pals in my first original auction, WHICH WAS CLOSED! Hi everybody, its airsoft_4241 here. Yup, youre rite, i am new in selling items here, hence i totally have no idea how to properly answer your questions. This is the only way i can think of. ok, 1st things 1st. Im an avid user of yahoo auctions. Ive got no ratings becos i applied for a new id juz to sell this info. Cmon, who would use such a catchy title on such an open market? Why am i selling this info is for one simple reason. Truthfully, i wanna make a quick buck, who doesnt? Secondly, theres this guy from hong kong selling the stuff itself! wow! thatll take a lot of guts to do it here! im doing this cos i will not be handling any of the items, so guess ill be quite safe. i am a big time airsoft fan myself. I was really on cloud 9 when a friend told mi he knew where i could buy them. I couldt believe at first, cos i noe that its near impossible it can even come into the country. Rest assure that the seller is very authentic and has new stocks or replenishments at least once a month. Check out how much they are on sale in this auction itself? go check on the sold items and youll find a guy who bought gun no.2 for S$250! The exact same damn gun! I got it for only S$60! so instead of earning commission everytime theres a sale on the net, might as well i make juz a few bucks and run! You noe guys, i wont blame you if you guys wanna fork out S$10 each to pay mi for the info. Making S$100 is a great big bonus for mi, cos im juz doing nothing but lotsa typing and earning money. Who doesnt want? and i wont blame you for being skeptical. Im an auction user too, and i noe that somethings are too good to be true. S$100 to mi and S$60 for the gun. Its S$90 cheaper and guess wat, you will noe where to buy and you can continue to buy it your whole life! You think i got the info for free ah! but i dun mind trying cos i really want an airsoft gun! and my gamble paid off! Guys, you noe why i cant bring you there, meet you or watever, cos we noe how risky this stuff is. The great part is, if you manage to pyscho your friends to share your hobby, the seller will even go to your location whenever there are new stocks! ok, I say so much first, think ive answered most of your ques rite? But feel free to email mi at airsoft_4241@yahoo.com.sg if youve got other questions. But pls give mi sometime, maybe 2 or 3 days to reply, cos you see lah, juz 1 nite and sooooo many questions i gotta answer. Dun worry, we all share the same passion. Maybe we can even have a club that meet up once in a while on some remote place in sg to have a war! Haha! cheers guys!<br><br>&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br><br>u guys think he saying the truth? </strong><br><br>---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br><br>Actually i'm the one who told this guy "<strong>yjkeh</strong>" where to buy.<br><br>actually the reason that i tell him not to tell the location 'coz <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>that is the only shop i know!</strong></span><br><br>[/u]i don't want tell others abt the location to all of you 'coz. if i tell or that yjkeh tell the location, <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">it will be a big risk</span></strong><br><br>Pls understand!<br><br>pm me or message me!<br></div>
