Or very difficult to 'freelance' something... You always must join something official, usually some quasi-government organisation if you wanna have fun, either PA, CC, SAFRA etc.... How about I dun wanna join anything, just wanna have some fun with my close friends?<br><br>I think main thing is other countries are big, the government can't control everything... here so small, everything also want to control... explore a bit kena charge with trespassing liao...  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cry.gif" alt="Crying or Very sad" title="Crying or Very sad"></div>
