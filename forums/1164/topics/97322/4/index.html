            <div class='col-md body'>I used to live in Hong Kong and another Singaporean friend living there quickly introduceed me to airsoft guns.<br><br>I bought and modified an MP5 and joined in in "wargames" with other airgun enthusiasts, mostly Hong Kongers.<br><br>The HKers love to dress up in full gear with helmet, SBO and flak vests!<br><br>Some would be dressed as SS Waffen and armed with the Stg 43.<br><br>Some would be dressed as SWAT in full gear with sidearms etc. Very impressive - to look at.<br><br>Me and my friend are rather more simple. He dons his SAF No 4, SBO and beret where I just wear my No4 pants and boots. Top I wear a hunting camo smock my friend gave me. No SBO or headgear.<br><br>Airsoft battles are really adrenalin pumping events. Everyone has heavily-modified weapons that will give you severe swelling if you get shot too close.<br><br>It's great fun as once, I saw a troop of about 15 from the enemy side trying to flank us. I could see them from 500m away cos one of the idiots was dressed in SWAT all black moving through low bush!<br><br>I led my friend and another HKer to a position to ambush them. When they walked into our trap, we shot about 12 of them. But one guy broke off and attacked me from a side I wasn't watching. I got shot in the neck, arm and fingers.<br><br>My neck bled from a pellet cut and my fingers were swelling slightly as was my arm. He shot me from about 10 metres away.<br><br>My friend shot him in return.<br><br>SAF should introduce this for training. Never have I taken cover or run so quickly during SAF training.

Damn painful ganna hit by pellets, especially during "Power" games which is all souped up weapons. You know, I made quite a lot of money selling Beach Road bought No. 4 and SBOs, camos etc to these HK guys. They pay good money for it because it is a "hobby" activity for them.<br><br>Anyway, I lost a tooth to a pellet when I was only wearing half face mask. Was watching the game too close (I already dead) and next thing I felt a pellet at the back of my throat. Cost me HK$5000 at the dentist.<br><br>Hey, did you joined a team? If so, whats the name? My team is made up mostly of ex-british volunteer corp and a US Army officer. Maybe we skirmed before? My team is more tactics focused rather than mindless spraying the battlefield until the weapon jam or batt run out. But difficult to shot commands from the full faced mask.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Xprobe<br><br>No, I am not a part of any team. In fact, I stopped going to these wargames very quickly as most of the people we played against were not very sporting.<br><br>Eventually, we just lost interest and work took up most of our time. And soon we both left HK for different parts of China.<br><br>We did play one game where there were only 10 of us, all friends. So we split into 8 vs 2. The 2 would go into hiding and then the 8 would try to hunt them down. Very exciting when it's yout turn to be the ones hunted by 8 enemies.</div>
