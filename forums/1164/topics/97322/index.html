SG has very strict laws regarding toys mimicking guns, all toy guns have orange tipped barrel, airsoft guns also have. my advise is dat if u like shooting, go sign up membership at a CC and play there, but its not cheap. More info can be found in airsoft forum in here...</div>

They even have a name for themselves called 'cutters' and there are a few websites dedicated to 'cutters'.... Anyone has a daughter, better check her wrists...

I'm not looking for an argument here, the purpose of my thread is to find an avenue to buy authentic looking guns as a hobby.<br><br>I'm tired of repeating myself, the problem lies with the person possessing the gun, not the gun itself... Go read LaserLodz post again...<br><br>I AM looking at the big picture, Singapore has to open up in order to thrive in the long run... S'pore's image is a society that is straitjacketed by its government! Foreign talents are not attracted to stay here at all because they say it's a BORING place!
