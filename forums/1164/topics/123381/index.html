            <div class='col-md body'>Don't think we can really compare their pay scales with ours. It was good education to see what pay they are getting... but can't really draw any meaningful conclusions.<br><br>SAF is kind of different. We have to attract the regulars who are supposed to provide the trainer cadre and the leadership to the NS men and reservists. So , the pay scales look very good in the SAF. Plus, the fact that S'pore is a high -cost economy, so purchasing power is also a factor.<br><br>What about reservists in SAF?  Some of us are earning more than what our regular rank in the SAF would pay.  If we compare this against their pay  scales, can we really say that we are a high salaried armed forces?</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Guys,<br><br>This might help you guys - ROY DAVIS LINVILLE JUMPER is a political scientist who is trained in the fields of Comparative Politics, International Relations, and Public Policy. He is the author of two previous books: Orang Asli Now (1999) and Power and Politics (1997).<br><br>The Senoi Praaq is a Malaysian special forces unit originally created in 1956 by the British colonial authorities to fight communism during the Malayan Emergency. The term "Senoi Praaq," which roughly translates as "war people," stems from the Semai language and is the basis of a colorful legend in Malaysia. The unit is largely comprised of non-Malay tribal peoples known collectively as the Orang Asli of Peninsular Malaysia. Jumper details Senoi Praaq inception as a private army and its subsequent development into an affiliate of the Royal Malaysian Police (RMP) in this fast paced and often graphic account of irregular warfare as it applies to counterinsurgency.<br><br>The unit began as a creature of British Military Intelligence and fought in the deep jungle as Special Air Service (SAS) proteges, eventually replacing the latter upon Malaysian independence from Great Britain. They then served as mercenaries employed by the United States Central Intelligence Agency in Vietnam and later fought on Borneo during Malaysia's own undeclared war with Indonesia. Today the unit remains under arms and heads up a large paramilitary apparatus maintained in conjunction with conventional military forces. Malaysia's capacity to project force throughout South East Asia should not be underestimated, Jumper warns. The Senoi Praaq is a unique fighting force upon which Malaysia may rely to preserve her sovereignty.<br>** Table of Contents **<br>-- Glossary<br>-- Abbreviations<br>-- Maps<br>-- Introduction<br>-- The Political Background<br>-- The Emergency and the Turn of Events Leading to Formation of the Senoi Praaq<br>-- The Senoi Praaq Deploys<br>-- The Senoi Praaq Deploy in Vietnam<br>-- The Senoi Praaq Stands Down in Vietnam as the Indonesian Crisis Erupts<br>-- The Indonesian Confrontation on Borneo and its Spread to Penninsular Malaysia<br>-- Senoi Praaq Rehabilitation<br>-- Conclusion<br>-- Sources Consulted<br></div>
