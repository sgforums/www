            <div class='col-md body'>On a neutral note, it's hard to tell simply by tallying losses. Some of the losses are due to normal attrition via accident in combat operations. In Ohama the Allies took more losses then the Axis, but the battle was an Allied victory.<br><br>And not to mention accounting on the Hezbollah side is extremely difficult to trust or even start with. By the amount of ground action that took place (and losses on the IDF infantry side), they are admitting a ridiculusly low amount of losses (60 fighters and not much else after all that fighting)... but their claims are consistent with the theory that they are trying to pitch of winning every single battle and making the IDF look like fools.<br><br>I find that a little hard to believe. The overall direction of the war may be misguided, but the IDF are no slackers in killing the enemy. It is highly likely that Hezbollah took heavy losses in this war that they simply do not need to be accountable for. The IDF however, is accountable for their losses to the govt. and Israeli public and can afford to be less flexible for their tallies. This is not counting the amount of people who decided to resist the IDF as armed combatants not offically reconized as Hezbollah.<br><br>But if you ask me there is no clear winner. However, Hezbollah can be said to be getting the better deal out of this conflict as they managed to secure propangada and opinion victories. In terms of military, it might very well be quite a serious blow that they are trying not to talk about at the moment.<br><br>Israel has been far less adept on that front, and when they got into that conflict it was in a sense and unwinnable war for their enemy disguise their losses, simply run away and let the political weight of the conflict bear down on the side that has to be more accountable for their actions.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>The problem is that sometimes, both sides can claim victory, and no one can totally shoot down either side's reasoning.<br><br>Take the Polish-Soviet war of 1920 for instance. Poland had invaded the Ukraine with the intent to set up a buffer against Russian imperialism. The Russians managed to chase them back to Poland with the full intent of capturing and spreading communism to Western Europe.<br><br>In the end the Poles managed to fend off the Soviets and claim a successful defence of their newborn state. At the same time, the Soviets claimed a successful repulsion of the Polish invasion of Ukraine.<br><br>So... who's right?   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br>More can be read here: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polish-Soviet_War" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polish-Soviet_War</a></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hmm...<br><br>Well the fact that they were surprised by the capabilities of Hezbollah shows that they went in without proper intelligence. If you don't even have this kind of intelligence how to pick out what to destroy?<br><br>But maybe in round 2 it might be different. I mean now more of Hezbollah's cards are known, I wonder how things might progress if (touch wood) there is another fight.</div>
