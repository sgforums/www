            <div class='col-md body'>Reading the report in the author's first post, I lost count but I think China has used some rather devious means (as usual) to buy up to 4 carriers so far for study.<br><br>There used to be a TV advert in China that was shot above one of these vessels with Carina Lau Kar Ling. There was a full complement of aircrafts on deck even.<br><br>I find it strange that they have rejected offers from other people who would build the carriers for them - choosing instead to spend time to R&amp;D and build it themselves.<br><br>Operating carriers is definitely the way to go for China. China will feel hapless if it continues to be hemmed in by its lack of REAL sea power.<br><br>I don't think the expense will deter them. Besides, the strategic advantage for China to operate a carrier group outweighs all other considerations.<br><br>They have sent people up to space already, which is a silly, useless waste of money. But it is one of those chest-beating thing to show the world that "China also can".<br><br>So if they will do that, you can bet your last dollar that die die they will have a carrier task force to challenge US for the job of schoolyard bully.</div>

And if its a civil war, even the UN or USA also can't intervene them.
