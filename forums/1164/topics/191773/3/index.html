            <div class='col-md body'>I have to say that...Singapore armed forces in the region is the best... Best equip and most modernised. Especially our airforce,we have the strike abilites and capable of conducting Precison strike and night fighting capabilites. Thailand has a strong army but not so well-equipped and it's airforce sucks with many outdated F-16/A and F-5E... Spore is also has the most indigenous weapon(although we need a little bit help from Uncle Sam)in ASEAN.. We make our own IFV,Self -propel Artillery,howitzer,SAR-21,Matador,LSD,APV.... WE MAYBE SMALL AND A LITTLE RED DOT ON WORLD MAP BUT WE WILL STING U LIKE HELL IF ANY ASEAN COUNTRIES TOUCH US!!!</div>
