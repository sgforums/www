And my answer is simple.  If you don't defend the country, your family will suffer.  Now are you (not you literally but anyone) willing to let your family &amp; loved ones suffer?  If not then there shouldn't be any doubt as to whether you will fight or not.<br><br>But of course if you (once again, not literally) are a coward &amp; would rather abscond even if it means dumping your loved ones behind to get slaughtered, then its a different story lah.<br><br>Many people seem to forget that if war does break out, we are not just fighting for the land or the PAP or the Lee Dynasty.  We're also fighting to protect our loves ones.  Because as long as the country is in a state of war, they are not safe.  So will we fight?  I leave that to the individual to choose.</div>

If we allow war to come to Singapore's shores, we're screwed regardless of the outcome of the war. There's only so much space to maneuver in 650 km2 of land. That's not much land for the enemy to pulverise, either.
