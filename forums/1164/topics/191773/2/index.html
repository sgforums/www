Niven, head of the Gurkha Contingent in Singapore.<br><br>The Gurkhas' main strength is their impartiality in the multiracial city-state of four million people.<br><br>"In the local context, impartiality is one of their unique attributes," Niven said.<br><br>"Not being influenced by the local scene is part of their concept in Singapore. They just don't get emotionally involved in anything they may get caught up in."<br><br>It is the absence of political or religious roots in Singapore that has granted the soldiers a reputation of utmost objectivity -- key to success in Singapore which is inhabited by ethnic Chinese, Malay and Indian communities.<br><br>ON A KNIFE EDGE<br><br>The Gurkha Contingent was officially created in Singapore in 1949 from ex-British Army Gurkhas.<br><br>The city state has expanded the Contingent in the past few years, according to a source with knowledge of the Gurkhas, but the events of September 11 could result in further increases.<br><br>"Before, you just never saw them on the streets (of Singapore)," said the source, who did not want to be identified. "But the government is pushing them more into the public domain, which is a very interesting phenomenon."<br><br>The recent arrests of Islamic militants suspected of plotting bomb attacks have cast a shadow over the security-conscious island republic.<br><br>"We are a police force and we respond to what our republic requires of us in times of peace or in time of tension in the world," Niven said.<br><br>"We are unique here in the sense that our Gurkhas are police officers... While a soldier is perhaps out there to kill people, Gurkhas here are essentially present to maintain the peace, and protect people and property."<br><br>Yet, a Gurkha cop is still a Gurkha. According to legend, once his kukri dagger has been drawn in battle, it must "taste blood". If it has not, its master has to cut himself before returning it to its sheath.<br><br>Descended from the Rajputs tribes of North India, Gurkhas conquered the small Nepali region of Gorkha after being forced out from India in the early 16th century. Settling down in their new home, they called themselves Gurkhas.<br><br>A CITY IN A CITY<br><br>From there, Gurkhas have travelled widely, serving the British empire in many parts of Asia but particularly Singapore and Hong Kong.<br><br>The Gurkha Cantonment in Singapore is like another world, with its own shops, schools and playgrounds.<br><br>"This is a small township, and I am like a mayor," Niven said.<br><br>Stationed in Singapore on a temporary mission, the Gurkhas do not sink deep roots into the city's soil. They are not allowed to.<br><br>The principle of impartiality forbids them to marry Singaporean women.<br><br>Most end up returning home to their villages in the hills where most people grow rice and wheat.<br><br>So far, only two or three of them have broken the tradition and chosen to stay in Singapore instead of returning to Nepal, one of the world's poorest countries and torn by a six-year-old Maoist rebellion that has claimed some 3500 lives.<br><br>Niven said they are mainly recruited from the Hindu and Buddhist villages and begin their careers at the age of 18 to 22.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I wouldn't call the Gurkhas an auxilliary force since they are part of the SPF.  Yes we do see them at prisons but prisons also has their own SPEAR unit which is mobilised if there are riots, prison breaks, hostage situation &amp; the like.  So when they active SPEAR or when they activate the Gurkhas, we wouldn't know.<br><br>As for anti-terrorist, that's covered by lots of units these days.  STAR used to be a land based unit but now they have maritime capabilities &amp; of late counter terrorist capabilities too.  SOF has always been a CT unit.  Police Coast Guard's elite Special Task Squadron is now CT capable too.  And of course there's the Naval Diving Unit's SWG which is also CT capable.  Hell, its damn complicated and none of us know who gets activated when.  And honestly, I'm not gonna crack my head figuring it out.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br>With regard to the Tekong incident, 2 of the 3 idiots were caught by the Gurkhas while the remaining one was nabbed by the STS.

Immagine some idiot has his weapon and ammo snatched by the illegal immigrants.<br><br>Just like seeing pale, skinny, bespectacled and underaged-looking NS men with SAR-21 at Changi airport a couple years ago. Some of them look like clerks or storemen, or at best, medics from the brigade HQ medical center. They don't inspire confidence in the civvies using the airport and definitely won't deter any terrorists. In fact, the minute I saw them I contemplated how easy it would be to snatch their weapon and ammo (all 5 rounds of it <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"> )<br><br>They patrol together with what look like airport SWAT and these guys look a hell lot more professional. In fact, together it looked like these SWAT guys are taking a bunch of children (SAF) out for a walk.<br><br>Can't they at least have a selection process based on appearance?<br><br>And what the hell are they going to do if there was indeed a terror attack? Are they trained to know what to do? Are they gonnna open fire?<br><br>The complete lack of experience aside, an assault rifle is probably the wrong weapon in a crowded civvy area. There must be a reason why SWAT prefer SMGs like MP5. </div></blockquote>i agree....since i did see a bunch of black and blue berets patorling the airport.<br>The SOC guys look way more mean hah.<br>Anyway the 700 sent after them were either supporting or running checkpoints/patrols and protecting BMTC rather then actually chasing the 3 of them.The SOF and gurkkas were the ones in the jungles</div>
