            <div class='col-md body'>(Source: US Navy; issued Sept. 14, 2004)<br><br>ABOARD USS JOHN C. STENNIS --- Soviet-designed MiG-29s flew against F/A-18C Hornets, F/A-18E Super Hornets and F-14D Super Tomcats Sept. 7 during joint air-to-air combat exercises over the South China Sea.<br><br>The joint Carrier Air Wing (CVW) 14/ Royal Malaysian Air Force (RMAF) exercise began with Strike Fighter Squadron (VFA) 115 flying the F/A-18E Super Hornet, and Fighter Attack Squadron VFA-25 flying the F/A-18C Hornet against the RMAF MiG-29s with four one-on-one engagements, each practicing within-visual-range air-to-air combat exercises with the historically-adversarial MiG.<br><br>The second part of the exercise involved VFA-113 flying the F/A-18D Hornet, and Fighter Squadron (VF) 31 flying the F-14D Super Tomcat, conducting mock Â“dog fightÂ” engagements in a beyond-visual range exercise.<br><br>Lt. Dave Faehnle, training officer for VF-31, said the exercise was a great opportunity to fly against an aircraft that presents a real-world threat.<br><br>Â“We flew two, two-on-two runs against the MiG-29s,Â” said Faehnle. Â“We achieved our mission objective, to see their aircraft on radar and to engage a dissimilar aircraft. It was a great opportunity to observe some of their tactics and to exercise some of our own radar systems.Â”<br><br>The exercise was controlled by CVW-14Â’s Carrier Airborne Early Warning Squadron (VAW) 113 Â“Black Eagles,Â” flying E-2C Hawkeyes.<br><br>Lt. Jill Dougherty was the air intercept control officer during the exercise and provided battle space situational awareness to the MiG to find their adversaries.<br><br>Â“It was fascinating,Â” said the Lexington Park, Md., native, Â“to control and interact with one of the most significant threats to U.S. military aircraft today.Â”<br><br>Lt. Stephen Dean flew a Super Hornet against the MIG during one of the morning engagements. According to Dean, one of the most impressive things he saw was when Â“hisÂ” MiG pulled a high performance, nine-G turn. A nine-G turn is a turn that causes the aircraft and the pilot to experience nine times the force of gravity.<br><br>Â“One of the qualities of the MiG-29 is its superb maneuverability,Â” said Dean, of Oak Harbor, Wash.<br><br>According to VFA-115Â’s Operations Officer, Lt. Cmdr. Keven Harms, the exercise was considered a success.<br><br>Â“The opportunity to fly against the aircraft that is considered Naval AviationÂ’s percentage threat, the MiG-29, was truly a once in a lifetime event and is sure to be the highlight of the cruise for everyone who participated,Â” he said.<br><br>Stennis is currently on a scheduled deployment to the Western Pacific and is scheduled to return to homeport in San Diego this fall.<br><br>hmm ... tit-tat?<br><br>we fly with french<br>they fly with americans<br><br>why never all fly together? french and american still divorce?<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hey tVdog, i think we should consider the Harrier|| because the RAF trashed them last year in an open exercise.

            <div class='col-md body'>AN/APG-68 V(9) radar on our F-16C/D Block 50 (+ version):<br><br>APG-68(V)9 Radar for Block 50/52 F-16<br>Manufacturer: Northrop Grumman<br><br>The Israeli Soufa F-16I, and Hellenic F-16 Block 52s are equipped with the latest version of Northrop Grumman APG-68 radar, the (V)9 multimode fire control radar that offers improved detection range and resolution. Only the Block 60 aircraft, destined for the UAE, are to be equipped with a more advanced version Â– the Active Electronically Scanned Array (AESA) radar. Initially, the Israelis favored the local Elta EL/M-2032 fire control radar originally developed for the IAI Lavi, but encountered financial and political obstacles. The IAF decided to use an improved model of the F-16 radar, and was involved in the specifications definition phase of the new version. It was later been selected by most of the latest acquisitions Â– by Poland and Greece. The new version uses new, Commercial Off The Shelf (COTS) technology that provided faster processors that provide increased throughput, with x5 faster processing speed and x10 growth in memory capacity over the current version. With the powerful processing capability, the new system has a high resistance to electromagnetic interference and countermeasures and future growth potential. The system offers new and improved capabilities in both air/air and air/ground modes, primarily in the operation at long range (BVR) and target rich airspace. The APG-68(V)9 offers 30 percent increase in detection range, improved search-while-track mode (four vs. two tracked targets) and larger search volume and improved track while scan performance. Its single target track performance has also been improved.<br><br>On air/ground missions, the new radar becomes an effective sensor, utilizing its high-resolution synthetic aperture radar mode, which allows the pilot to locate and recognize tactical ground targets from considerable distances. Although previous radars had some Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) capabilities, the new version generates imagery-class (2 feet resolution) high resolutions pictures, comparable to pictures delivered by the most modern commercial satellites. These pictures can be acquired from very long range, at all weather conditions and provide an effective, real-time source for the targeting of long range, precision guided weapons. The radar also has increased detection range in sea surveillance mode, and enhanced ground moving target identification and mappinc capability. The radar features an inertial measurement unit that improves dynamic tracking performance and provides an auto-boresight capability, which increase accuracy.<br>http://www.defense-update.com/products/a/apg68-v-9.htm<br><br><img src="http://www.f-16.net/PhotoGallery/album33/abm.sized.jpg"><br>www.f-16.net pictures.<br><br>The V(9) version of the AN/APG-68 radar provides both improved air-to-air capabilities and air-to-ground capabilities. These include:<br><br>30 percent increase in detection range;<br>Improvements in false alarm rate and mutual interference;<br>Four versus two tracked targets in the Situation Awareness mode (a search-while-track mode);<br>Larger search volume and improved track performance in Track While Scan mode;<br>Improved track performance in Single Target Track mode;<br>Two-foot resolution in new Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) mode, which allows autonomous delivery of precision, all-weather, standoff weapons;<br>Increased detection range in Sea Surveillance mode;<br>Improved target detection and map quality in Ground Moving Target Indication mode.<br><br>In general, this radar offers a 5X increase in processing speed and 10X increase in memory compared to the current AN/APG-68 radar and provides large growth potential.<br>http://www.f-16.net/f-16_versions_article9.html<br>[/img]</div>

Singapore should find a budget and a role for the Harrier aircraft. Though is is an old aircraft and can't fly very fast, its VSTOL properties will be great especially if runways of our 3 airbase are cratered. Hey, as someone suggested, we can turn our LSTs into aircraft carriers! : )</div></blockquote>Harrier may be totally wrong for us. The problem is harrier did make a name for themselves in the falkland war and some dog fights. But note this does not  mean they are suitable for singapore.<br><br>Harrier in the falkland main duties are to do just fleet air defense, and close air support for shore. The mean they excel in exactly within their envelop, which the battle is all contained within a small area, which harrier have the advantage. Same as excerises, they are restricted with some constraints that are to the harrier advantage.<br><br>However in real life those constraints may not be suitable. For Singapore case, we would perfer to talk out threats before they can be, which mean forward bombing of enemy position, harrier failed badly as it lack the speed, range and load. For defense, it may also fail as you want to get out fast to intercept it , not fight it over singapore.<br></div>

I think you do better if you convert a big containter ship for it. Just strengthen the containers and put them on top till flat top all wielded together, and lay a surface on it.

During the 80's I saw a pictorial concept for a RAF carrier without use of runways or ski jumps but using mechanical cranes to lift harriers port side and launching them.</div>

As i have said, a LST is a LST and a carrier is a carrier, you cant turn an LST into a carrier. If you use the hull of the Endurance, build a few support hangars on the sub deck and a control tower on the deck, you are not turning an LST into a carrier, <strong>you are building a carrier from a metal hull</strong>.<br><br>If you retain the normal structure of the Endurance and allow it to carry JSF, <span style="color: red;">that is NOT a carrier, but a LST with JSF, you get it</span>? Not every ship that carry a number of aircraft is a carrier, i know of LPDs which can carry the same of aircraft an aircraft carrier can carry but it is still known as a LPD and i know of destroyers that can carry more helicopters than our Endurance, it is still known as a destroyer...<br><br>Dare to explore? Hey brother look here lah, explore can, but make sure you have the knowledge k? Dun be funny to say that an LST with JSF is a carrier or by changing the superstructure of the LST you get a carrier from an LST.<br><br></div>
