            <div class='col-md body'>DMR in all countries have been a full size 30 caliber rifle that is like the 7.62x51mm or 54R! never a small caliberlike the 7.62x39 or 5.45/<br><br>As for SKS there is no good way to mount a scope on the rifle! So is the AK series!  they since have put a scope mount on the AK but than it is more of a compromise . Thus! the SVD still does a bgetter job than any of the rifle out there as a DMR.  US have recenntly revamped the M14 and issueing them out as DMR!<br><br>DaveC!</div>

Both of his guns were purchased legally.<br><br>Citizens and permanent residents are allowed to purchase firearms in the US.<br><br>Individuals purchasing firearms from licensed FFL dealers at gun shows have to submit to a background check (the National Instant Criminal Background Check System, or NICS for short) at the time of the purchase. The checks are nearly instantaneous, and involve the dealer calling the relevant state or federal NICS agency by telephone with information about the purchaser. If the purchaser's records come back clean, approval for the sale is given, usually within minutes of the call being made.<br><br>In some states, holders of handgun carry permits are exempted from these checks when purchasing a firearm, the rationale being that the background checks had already been performed at the time of the permit application.<br><br>Some states do not require a NICS check for <span style="font-style: italic;">private, in-state</span> firearm transactions.</div>

This wouldn't surprise me, as I've encountered a number of these sales drones who aren't up to date on firearms regulations. But that's really a non-issue as the sale would be flagged at the time it's called in for the NICS background check.<br><br>Federal regulations trump state regulations. <a href="http://www.atf.gov/firearms/022002newregs4nonimmigrant.pdf" rel="nofollow">Here</a> are the BATFE regulations specifically pertaining to the sale of firearms to non-immigrant aliens.<br><br><blockquote><strong>Yep that is freedom .... free to buy and shoot people. </strong></blockquote>That's a pretty ignorant statement.</div>

When you walk up to the counter and ask for a firearm to rent and to use their range, they will ask for an ID.

            <div class='col-md body'>Hi!<br><br>As what everyone has answered....<br><br>I have been to thailand and the range of weapons you can shoot is very limited. Comming to shoot in the US the best thing is to get with someone you know to shoot and you will really have a blast ! it is not shooting in those public ranges but goin to ranges and private lease that really make the differnnce.<br><br>U should not have any problem going to the public ranges which they usually rent guns.. both pistol and rifle to shooters! HOwever, not all of them will let you rent class 3 weapons ! which is machine guns ...<br><br>In Las Vegas there is an outfit that do rent C3 wepons but they are very expensive  !USUALY, the rental is not as much but the ammo they kill you on that!.<br><br>DaveC</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>You can't compare the shooting between Thailand and the US, but then again, it depends on what you're looking for. If you wanna simply plink with some Glocks, SIGs, etc, Thailand will do I'm sure but if you wanna go from zero to hero in a couple of days, then a good Tactical Pistol class in the US is the way to go. I've seen novices come in with no experience whatsoever and after 3 days, asked me if I wanted to take a bet at who gets the most at the plate rack! Happened to be a Singaporean too; gave him the nickname Ninja after that.<br><br>So, what kind of shooting do we do during a weekend?

It is quite a hoot but the situations given is defensive NOT offensive.
