            <div class='col-md body'>I am only guessing but most pictures of Ruskie troops I see, the SVD Dragunov is liberally issued.

            <div class='col-md body'>I guess in the SAF concept of a 7-man section, we cannot afford to have a designated marksman who carries a weapon that's too different from the basic assault role.<br><br>In the old days, we have SAW gunner, sharpshooter, M203. The only guys carrying regular AR's are the LAW gunner and the Section IC. Depending on each section's makeup, it varies. Some have 2 SAWs, some 2 M203's, some 2 LAW and some have 2 sharpshooters.<br><br>With the SAR-21, I may be wrong but the need for a separate sharpshooter has somewhat been made redundant as everyweapon is now a sharpshooter weapon.<br><br>Unlike the Russians I posted above, the SAF requirement for a section sharpshooter is actually very low - just a 1.5x scope.<br><br>IMHO, our section sharpshooter is most importantly a rifleman first, due to the small size of our sections.<br><br>So if they are armed with such a specialized weapon like the one you posted, they may not do so well in the assault role.</div>

            </div>
            <div class='col-md body'>Maybe another reason why our requirement for section sharpshooter is so low is because the terrain where the infantry section operates - jungle, plantation or FIBUA, you can't really see that far to snipe long distance.<br><br>I emphasize <strong>"where the infantry section operates". </strong><br><br>Because the sharpshooter moves with the section on assault. He doesn't detach himself to find a nice sniping position. Therefore, to equip him with a specialized sharpshooting weapon may be quite unnecessary. I feel the 1.5x scope with the 5.56 bullet is quite sufficient for infantry section fighting.<br><br>Having a 7.62 in the section would burden the ammo supply and he will have a weapon that's too big for FIBUA and FOFO or just bashing through vegetation.<br><br>There will be the real snipers deployed for these roles.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>well! looks like we have a SAR21 with a 3x scope ! that is a good idea becasue there may be time when your 1.5x scope cannot engage a target as effective out to 400 meters or more.... with the advent of better bullet like say the M855/SS109 or the 77 grain 5.56 ammo! we could effectively engage up to 600 meter! thus a 3 or 4x scope would be useful. Hopfully the scope has a ammunition calibration rectical or a Ballistic cam to compensate for the bullet drop at diffrent ranges.<br><br>a DMR would greatly increase a squad's capability ... the weight is insignificant becasue try enageing a man size target out to 600 meter would be very hard without a good optics! and the extra weight would be well worth it ! you can;t hit what you cannot see!<br><br>I have shoot side by side a AUG with 1.5x and a M16 with Elcan and I could easily engage at 600 yards on a man size gong with the Elcan!  with the Elcan we can easily ding the gong 8 out of 10! while the 1.5 AUG will be about 3 out of 10 becasue the AUG''s scope and also the AUG did not have the bullet drop compensation! at 600! it will be near impossibe to hold off ( kentucky windage) becasue the target is too small.<br><br>DaveC</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I just feel that mission can change and we may be engaging a differnt warfare where longer range engagement is needed.  Although statistically all engagement is done 100 meter or less, there are times when a terrorist or anything is further and the squad lose its effectiveness ! reason why US is supplementing their units with M14 and scoped M16... I guess same thing with the British which has the SUSAT scope . and if you look at the scope design! all have range compensation to the ammo use! thus the effectivelness of the rifle is increase! same with the SVD's PSO-1 scope! Dang! even the British SUIT scope in the 80s have a cam that has 300 and 500 meter setting!<br><br>Maybe it is time we train our troop level to engage differnt distance instead of learning to do the aim off thing!<br><br>The pooint being you can;t engage if you cannot see that well!reason you start seeing M4 with ACOG, FN-249 with ELcan and M240 with Elcan setup!<br><br>We had the vision to have the Sharpshooter concept for a long time!  ! WOnder why they kind of let it slip and neglected it!...<br><br>Maybe the 3x 4x scope is too expensive ! like this M4 setup with the ELcan is deadly at 600 yds with SS109 ammo!<br><br>DAveC!<br><br><img src="http://i3.photobucket.com/albums/y66/davechng/Guns/m4-3.jpg"></div>

They are all from Chechnya and I figured that there must be one SVD per section.<br><br>But ....<br><br>Even in old pictures from the 70's where they were using the AK-47, you still see the guy with the SVD right alongside the rest of the guys and dressed just like a rifleman.<br><br>I am curious as to why they don't use the SKS for DMR? I mean it is more accurate compared to the AK47, and it uses the same ammo.<br><br>That's why in the other thread I asked if the AK47 round is inherently inaccurate?<br><br>Of course, this could simply be that their concept of a Designated Marksman is completely different from us.</div>
