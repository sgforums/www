              <p>its true that if you put a battleship right next to the most advanced warship today, the battleship will blow it away, however, there is the issue of getting your battleship there... with regards to that, battleships are not really at home in today's naval environment, with the advent of more lethal and longer ranged weapons.</p>
              <p>if you ask me, what i would prefer would be a navy based on larger ships (etc destroyers and lpds) supported by a base of smaller, "mosquito" vessels. having the ability to sting hard and disrupt the enemy. in my view, this can't be acheived by aircraft carriers or battleships for singapore, as they would be a huge drain on resources, and would be rather restricted in their operations, and rendered heavily vulenerable, due to the prescence of multiple chokepoints around us, losing one would mean we lose the whole war....</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>just my 2 cents worth of thoughts over the past 5 mins.</p>

              <p>The last surface engagement between capital ships was probably the actions of Taffy 3 against the Yamato fleet off Luzon in WWII. Even then, that strictly wasn't an engagement between battleships - that was a David vs Goliath engagement between US destroyers and Japanese battleships. Try reading up on that - interesting stuff.</p>
              <p>Otherwise, for much of WWII, much of fighting between fleets was conducted between aircraft carriers which were so far apart that the ships did not actually see each other. The Battle of Midway, for instance had the carriers about 150km away from each other.</p>
              <p>Battleships didn't do a lot of work; towards the end of WWII they were used as little more than sea-based artillery for beach landings.</p>
              <p>We buy our ships based on our operational needs. Buying an aircraft carrier is seriously just a total waste of manpower and resources when there is absolutely no requirement for us to perform long-range force projection.</p>
              <p>And like I said.... putting together a single aircraft carrier group will suck up every single man, plane, and ship in the RSN and RSAF. Send the aircraft carrier group somewhere, and Singapore loses its entire home-based air and sea power. No kidding.</p>

              <p>Guys guys... This is just a opinion of mine... No need to get so worked up... In my point of view in modern warfares, aircraft carriers are the "rulers" of the seas... No doubt it cause a bomb to construct it, it also requires a huge amt. of manpower to sail her out to allow her operations to be a success... That I can understand... But what makes me feel awkward is, a navy w/o battleships?? That's ridiculous... Come on... I consider at least battleships presence in most navy... Since during the last world war, Japan has built 2 greatest battleships in the world, one named Yamato and the other named Musashi... Although the defeat of Japan in the Battle of Midway, IJN continued to construct more battleships and aircraft carriers in the upcoming battles despite the shortage of resources...</p>

              <p><br>NDPfreak wake up - this is 2008 - WII is long gone !!! Why you keep bring up WII to justify battleship - even US have phase out the last of their battleship - so does all other navy.  So that is no argument on it.</p>
              <p>technology and advancement have change a lot of things - gone are the days of battleships !!!</p>
              <p>Aircraft carrier ? Only for those rich enough to afford it and have the manpower to operate it. The cost of running an aircraft carrier + its air wings + escort fleet ( destoryers , crusiers, supply ships + submarine ) are just too high for most . What the use of aircraft carrier - if you so not have the money to buy fuels for your planes !!! What the use of aircraft carrier - if you are not able to prove it with the escorts that need to protect it ?</p>
              <p>What happen to US at pearl harbor ? Yes - with all the aircraft carriers and battleship - they still got bomb to shit !!!  LOL !!!</p>
              <p>No money + not enough people to man it  = even if you like it - wake up - you cannot afford it mean you cannot have it. If you insist very navy should have battleship or aircraft carrier - till the day you have the money to help each navy pay for them  - if not stop dreaming !!! </p>

              <p>Current usage of land still allows us to operate airbases without any difficulties.  But when land becomes more and more scarce, and naval automation becomes more advanced, we might see a shift that might be more favorable for an aircraft carrier.</p>
              <p>But before that, we will probably reclaim land until we cannot reclaim anymore.</p>

              <p>Your answer above  shows that you have not given any consideration to the questions I've posed for you to dwell on.  If you had even bothered to google it you'll be very aware of how misplaced your views are.  As it is you seem to only want someone to confirm your point of view and latch onto posts that pander to them. </p>
              <p>Do feel free to raise more questions or issues but I doubt you'll learn much from a free discussion until you've either done a bit of background reading/research or are willing to shut up and listen.</p>
