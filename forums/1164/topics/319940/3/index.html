              <p>Yes we have all studied Geography in Secondary School ... but nobody's Geography teacher is a failure.  Firstly, at secondary school level they just don't have the time to go into the depth required to give you a complete understanding of things.  Secondly, they are only teaching you geography not economics or finance.</p>
              <p>Do dwell on the thought that those of us who are older than you have also studied Economics and Finance in University.  As part of our daily life, many of us even read the newspapers, journals and various other online resources on world affairs ... not just computer games.</p>
              <p>What you have to understand is that your Point of View from Geography alone represents one side of the story.  Events around the world are much more complicated than that and are never truly affected by just ONE factor alone ... such as the dwindling oil supplies you are referring to.</p>
              <p>Please give others the benefit of the doubt that they could be right and that you are wrong.  Hear what others have to say, go do some research to double check what they are saying before you even attempt to contradict them.</p>
              <p>I'll help you out here by doing the searching for you.  Here's a link to report talking about what Shotgun was referring to ...</p>

              <p>seriously, you are either really only 16 years old and being a typical teenager ... or you are masquerading as a 16 year old and trolling ... either of which aren't very attractive.</p>

              <p>NDPfreak, technically battleships don't exist anymore. The last one was USS Missouri, decommissioned in 1992 (you can visit it at Pearl Harbor).</p>
              <p>Singapore, including RSN is VERY well-armed for its size. Only 9 countries operate aircraft carriers (not helicopter carriers) of some sort  - US, Russia, Brazil, Spain, UK, France, Italy, India and Thailand. Ignoring Thailand (because their aircraft carrier is almost never used), the poorest of these 9 countries operating carriers, India, has a GDP that is ~7 times ours [India's GDP is US$1,098 billion, S'pore's GDP of $161 billion, source: IMF figures for 2007). Even a country like Australia, with GDP &gt;5 times ours gave up their aircraft carriers over a decade ago. S. Korea, with 6 times our GDP has only LPDs. </p>
              <p>Aside from S'pore not needing this type of long distance force projection, carriers require a task force to protect and supply ships to replenish/refuel ($$$) and in order to ensure having an operational carrier at any moment, you actually need more than one carrier, because the ship needs maintenance/upgrades/retrofit (or else you enemy can attack you when your ship is the dock). I think everyone can see in the case of Thailand, their carrier, HTMS Chakri Naruebet is pretty much a white elephant. Let's not repeat their mistake.</p>
              </div>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>HTMS Chaukri Narubert is not an aircraft carrier. It is classified as an offshore patrol helicopter carrier. <a href="http://www.naval-technology.com/projects/chakrinaruebet/">http://www.naval-technology.com/projects/chakrinaruebet/</a>.</p>
              <p>However, while I agree that RSN lacks the manpower to operate a supercarrier and there is no need for it to operate one, operating a helicopter carrier would be ideal. A 20000 ton vessel which can accomodate 10++ attack helicopters or a few VTOL aircrafts and support an amphibious task force will allow RSN to do limited force projection.  Currently the 4 Endurance LSTs more or less fulfil this role though but it will be good to have  a helicopter carrier. Can also serve as the flagship of RSN.  No battleships fantasy, NDPfreak!!  Aircraft carriers have replaced battleships as the capital ships in  modern naval warfare!</p>

              <p><br>Well, you are right in one thing, if oil prices are high, it really doesn't matter that it shouldn't be.  We lan lan still have to pay.</p>
              <p>But like I said, land reclamation would still be our priority.  And who knows, they maybe able to find some other way to maintain a credible air force with minimal land usage?</p>
              <p>The problem with oil is that, is that there are so many conflicting views about it.  Some scientists say we are running out faster than expected, some say that using "proven" reserves to estimate how much oil we really have left is inaccurate.</p>
              <p><a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/business/4681935.stm">http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/business/4681935.stm</a> -- How much oil do we really have?</p>
              <p>From the way the oil prices are headed... if not managed properly, it really might be heading for a crash.  And yes, it seems like "pigs are gonna fly."  I remember TIME magazine once saying that, if OPEC does decide to increase its output, it might throw oil prices into a downward spiral.  That is against the interest of MANY oil giants as well...</p>
