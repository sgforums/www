            <div class='col-md body'>Not all trainees got up &amp; ran. Some were dragged up. Imagine dragging a comatose person &amp; "making" him run. That should give you an idea of what it looked like. Even for those who did get up &amp; run, my point is that you build fitness gradually. You do not subject recruits (esp unfit ones) to such training on their first day of BMT.<br><br>I do not know if any of them actually passed out 'cos everytime we tried to help a fellow recruit up, we would get farked. All I know is that for someone to just drop like that, he must be pretty exhausted, maybe even fainted for all we know.<br><br>Yes 3 months for BMT may be considered short. But no one said anything about dragging the training that much. I lost track of the number of times we ran around the Nee Soon parade square but I believe it was at least 10 rounds. And not forgetting the tons of sit ups, push ups &amp; star jumps as well. Whatever it is, this is NOT the type of training to do on the first day of BMT. Definitely its overboard.<br><br></div>

If the person is allergic to bee stings, a single wasp sting is already enough to kill him.<br><br>After exercise you are flat on your back. But did you sit yourself down &amp; then lie on your back? Or did you just collapse as though you fainted? During my first night of BMT (mind you, we were just enlisted that afternoon), we were asked to run around the parade square non stop. In the middle of the run, we would be stopped every now &amp; then to do push ups, sit ups, star jumps, etc and then continue running.<br><br>Most of us were not very fit (being from the PTP batch) &amp; were certainly not used to this suddenly VERY vigorous exercise. I saw with my own eyes several recruits collapse like flies. Some cynics might say they purposely fell so they could "rest" for a while.<br><br>Bullocks!! First of all, they didn't get to rest. If anyone fell, the instructors would squat next to them, fark the recruit &amp; his parents &amp; then drag the recruit up &amp; force him to continue. Secondly, I don't think they would purposely fall face first.  I saw some recruits collapse &amp; when they hit the road, it was SMACK face first. That has GOT to hurt &amp; like I said, I doubt anyone is dumb enough to do that on purpose.<br><br>When my buddy collapsed, he scrapped both elbows so badly that blood was flowing down his arms. Not only was medical attention not given, he was farked, told not to be a p[b]</strong>ussy &amp; forced to continue running. If anyone expects me to believe that my buddy did that on purpose to "rest", I'll show him my middle finger.<br><br>Fitness have to be built up gradually. You run 2km first, then 5km, then 10 km &amp; eventually 20km. If you are unfit, you do NOT run 20km on your first day. That is asking for trouble. Similarly, what happened to our batch was unacceptable. You do NOT subject recruits to that kind of treatment. Not on their very first day of BMT. If it was on the last week of BMT (pressumably most recruits are quite fit by then), it might have been more acceptable.[/b]</blockquote>The things described in the last paragraph contravenes all rules relating to optimum physical training and sports science.It's just a pure tekan session that is held too often at too many camps for too long a time already.</div>

He was prob following the damn SOP. If he follows SOP, he gets blamed for being inflexible. But if he doesn't follow SOP, he gets charged.  So the person to be shot should be the person who wrote the SOP.<br><br>Yes, during war time u concentrate on those victims who stand a chance. Those "gone cases" as you call them, no choice but to sacrifice them so others who stand a better chance of living can live.<br><br>But this was NOT war situation!! And I'm pretty sure a MO would not suka suka call for heli evac unless he's sure its needed. Don't forget, MO anyhow call for heli evac, I'm sure he'll get his arse fried too.</div>

Why is this so?</blockquote>I think the original post is a bit inaccurate. The actual word used in the papers was <strong>comatose</strong>. To substitute the word comatose for coma is misleading as most people without first aid training don't really get the difference between the two.<br><br>Under the Glasgow Coma Scale which is used by medical professionals to assess a patient's level of consciousness, a casualty can be given a total of 15 points (GCS 15) to a minimum of 3 points (GCS 3).<br><br>A GCS 15 rating means that the casualty is alert and able to respond both verbally and with movement (of muscles, limbs etc...).<br><br>A GCS 3 means that the casualty is totally unresponsive. Usually, GCS 3 will mean the casualty is near death.<br><br>Now, under medical classification, it only requires you to have a GCS 7 to be considered comatose. At GCS 7, a casualty quite literally has his eyes closed, can still make some sounds and can react to pain. Someone who's 'comatose' could have simply fainted from anxiety or stress and needn't be hosiptalised.<br><br>Thus, it might be understandable why the Air Force people didn't immediately want to medevac when they heard 'comatose'.<br><br>Still, I do find it strange why the MO just gave a one word ( "comatose" ) reply when asked about his patient's status, why didn't he give something more detailed like "GCS 5, Drowning"?<br><br>P.S. I'm only a registered First Aider not a licensed Medic, hopefully my post can be understood clearly. Perhaps a Combat Medic can comment on what I've posted?<br><br>P.S.S.
