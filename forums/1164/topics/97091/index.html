            <div class='col-md body'>I agree with the discussion.<br><br>I feel that what SAF should provide are guidelines to the MO and Commanders of a certain rank/appointment as to when heli- evacutation can be activated. I believe why SAF had some rules ( such as the 3 stings) is to prevent misuse. Since a certain rank has been "given" to these commanders, their judgement on the ground should be trusted. We all agree that SOP don't and can't cover every single situations that requires a heli-evact?<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"></div>

Does it mean that when a soldier has a small red swelling, then they must be evacuated?   What if it is a mosquito bite, or something innocuous?   Then SAF would not be viable because training and operations would be impossible.<br><br>Keep a database of each soldier and his allergies?   Medical test can be conducted to determine some allergies, but what about those that cannot be detected?   And what about the cost?<br><br><blockquote>Originally posted by esesce:<strong><br>This reminds me of an incident several years back. My friend (suffers from asthma) was doing his BMT.

I would not be confident to say if the officer is at fault without further information.   For example, was your friend's condition made known to the officer at the start of the training course with proper medical certification?<br><br><blockquote>Originally posted by esesce:<strong><br>Yes, there are ppl who chao keng, but the problem is non medically trained ppl can't tell them apart from genuine cases.

Even they make mistakes.   Imagine the logistics problems that arises when every complaint are to be evacuated/sent to medical centre - how many safety vehicles would be necessary to follow a platoon exercise?   What if a genuine emergency occurs when the safety vehicle is not available because of a minor case?<br><br><blockquote>Originally posted by esesce:<strong><br>And to that, I should mention my CSM during my BMT recourse.

However, don't be so hasty to put down "those b*stards" - most of them are doing what they think best under constraints of the training situation.

I am saying that there are no way where every contigency can be explictly catered for.

I guess that you are probably right in that the officer can't remember the specific problems with each of the soldier under his charge.<br><br>3.   What is "collapse"?   Sometimes after exercise, I get so tired that I am flat on my back.   Is that collapse?   My point is that trainees need to be pushed to some extent - and I have no definition for "extent".   When a person <strong>thinks</strong> that he has reached his limit, it may not be his true limit.   It all comes back to a judgement call - and a judgement call can be right or wrong depending on many factors.   A person who can run 2.4 in 8 minutes in one day may die of heart failure trying to do 10 min another day.   Therefore, those responsible can only do their best.   <strong>I agree that there are some who will act like ass-holes, but my believe is that most are just trying to do what they thing is right.</strong><br><br>4.   I have already stated my opinion on medevac and coma.   About "different perspectives", I am not only referring to this specific instance - it applies to the rest of your previous post.</div>

I was one of the most unfit soldier in the platoon in my BMT, SAFINCOS and ANCO courses and I had a hell of a time.   At one stage in my ANCO course, the whole detachment had not been able to achieve delpoyment timing, and since I was the biggest sized guy in the detachment, I was picked for the deployment task over and over again so that timing can be achieved.   (I <strong>KNOW</strong> that the trainer picked me not because I was targetted, but because he needed the timing to be met so that we can break off the training.)  After a few rounds I had to tell him that I can no longer continue because I was too shagged.   Therefore I know what it was to be like being unfit.   However, I can also say that without being pushed during all the various courses, I would not even achieve the fitness level required to pass IPPT and SOC.<br><br>While I had agreed that fitness had to built up gradually, we had to take into consideration that BMT is only three months, and the time needed to build up fitness simply is not there.   Solution?   Longer BMT?   (Don't curse me all those waiting for enlistment - I don't mean it <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"> )   Ultimately, it is the responsibility of those who are about to enlist to ensure that they are prepared for army life.   Which brings me back to my initial observation some post back - those responsible (PTI, officers and NCOs) have to work within the constraints of the environment/situation.</strong></div>
