Rotor wash blows snake into fire.<br><br>Quartermaster: Encounters snake, then loses contact. Can not identify who owns snake by hand receipts. Orders new snake through supply channels.

Gives Signal Corps $5 Billion to make this happen. SigO abuses the 2 smart people in the corps to make it happen, while everybody else stands around, %$&amp;$!es, and takes credit. In the end, GTE and several sub-contractors make a few billion dollars, the two smart people get out and go to work for them, and the commander gets what he asked for only in fiber-optic based simulations. The snake dies of old age.<br><br>SJA: Swear they saw something like that on the Discovery Channel . . . spend weeks arguing if it was a snake or not.<br><br>Special Forces: Makes contact with snake, ignores all State Department directives and Theater Commander Rules of Engagement by building rapport with snake and winning its heart and mind.

Rodents are not entitled to burial with full military honors, even if they are "casualties of war".<br><br>103. My commander is not old enough to have fought in the civil war, and I should stop implying that he did.<br><br>104. Vodka, green food coloring, and a Â“Cool MintÂ” ListerineÂ® bottle is not a good combination.<br><br>105. I am not allowed to bum cigarettes off of anyone under twelve.<br><br>106. I may not trade my rifle for any of the following: Cigarettes, booze, sexual favors, Kalishnikovs, Soviet Armored vehicles, small children, or bootleg CDÂ’s.<br><br>107. Must not mock command decisions in front of the press.<br><br>108. Should not taunt members of the press, even if they are really fat, exceptionally stupid, and working for UPI.<br><br>109.

I am not qualified to operate any US, German, Polish, or Russian Armored vehicles.<br><br>112. When saluting a Â“legÂ” officer, an appropriate greeting is not "Airborne leads the wa- oh...sorry sir".<br><br>113. There is absolutely no need to emulate the people from Â“Full MontyÂ” every time I hear the song "Hot Stuff".<br><br>114. I cannot trade my CO to the Russians.<br><br>115. I should not speculate on the penis size of anyone who outranks me.<br><br>116. Crucifying mice - bad idea.<br><br>117. Must not use government equipment to bootleg pornography.<br><br>118. Burn pits for classified material are not revel fires - therefore it is wrong to dance naked around them.<br><br>119. I cannot arrest children for being rude.<br><br>120. An EO briefing is probably not the best place to unveil my newest off color joke.<br><br>121. I should not use government resources to Â“waterproofÂ” dirty magazines.<br><br>122. Radioactive material should not be stored in the barracks.<br><br>123. I should not teach other soldiers to say offensive and crude things in Albanian, under the guise of teaching them how to say potentially useful phrases.<br><br>124. Two drink limit does not mean first and last.<br><br>125. Two drink limit does not mean two kinds of drinks.<br><br>126. Two drink limit does not mean the drinks can be as large as I like.<br><br>127. Â“No Drinking Of Alcoholic BeveragesÂ” does not imply that a Jack DanielÂ’s Â® IV is acceptable.<br><br>128. "Shpadoinkle" is not a real word.<br><br>129. The Microsoft Â® Â“Dancing PaperclipÂ” is not authorized to countermand any orders.<br><br>130. Â“IÂ’m drunkÂ” is a bad answer to any question posed by my commander.<br><br>131. No dancing in the turret. This especially applies in conjunction with rule #113.<br><br>132. The loudspeaker system is not a forum to voice my ideas.<br><br>133. The loudspeaker system is not to be used to replace the radio.<br><br>134. The loudspeaker system is not to be used to broadcast the soundtrack to a porno movie.<br><br>135. An order to put polish on my boots means the whole boot.<br><br>136. Shouting Â“LetÂ’s do the village! LetÂ’s do the whole &amp;^!^ing village!Â” while out on a mission is bad.<br><br>137. Should not show up at the front gate wearing part of a Russian uniform, messily drunk.<br><br>138. Even if my commander did it.<br><br>139. Must not teach interpreters how to make "MRE" bombs.<br><br>140. I am not authorized to sell mineral rights.<br><br>141.

I should not threaten suicide with pop rocks and Coke Â®.<br><br>148. Putting red Â“Mike and Ike'sÂ” Â® into a prescription medicine bottle, and then eating them all in a formation is not funny.<br><br>149. Must not create new DOD forms, then insist they be filled out.<br><br>150. On Sports Day PT, a wedgie is not considered a legal tackle.<br><br>151. The proper way to report to my Commander is Â“Specialist Schwarz, reporting as ordered, SirÂ” not Â“You can't prove a thing!Â”<br><br>152. The following items do not exist: Keys to the Drop Zone, A box of grid squares, blinker fluid, winter air for tires, canopy lights, or Chem-Light Â® batteries.<br><br>153. I should not assign new privates to Â“guard the flight lineÂ”.<br><br>154. Shouldn't treat Â“piss-bottlesÂ” with extra-strength icy hot.<br><br>155. Teaching Albanian children to taunt other soldiers is not nice.<br><br>156. I will no longer perform Â“lap-dancesÂ” while in uniform.<br><br>157. If I take the uniform off, in the course of the lap-dance, it still counts.<br><br>158. The revolution is not now.<br><br>159. When detained by MP's, I do not have a right to a strip search.<br><br>160. No part of the military uniform is edible.<br><br>161. Bodychecking General officers is not a good idea.<br><br>162. Past lives have absolutely no effect on the chain of command.<br><br>163. Take that hat off.<br><br>164. There is no such thing as a were-virgin.<br><br>165. I do not get Â“that time of monthÂ”.<br><br>166. No, the pants are not optional.<br><br>167. Not allowed to operate a business out of the barracks.<br><br>168.

            <div class='col-md body'>Why did the chicken cross the road?<br><br>USAF reactions to this event follow:<br><br>Air Education and Training Command:<br>The purpose is to familiarize the chicken with road-crossing procedures. Road-crossing should be performed only between the hours of sunset and sunrise. Solo chickens must have at least three miles of visibility and a safety observer.<br><br>Special Ops:<br>The chicken crossed at a 90 degree angle to avoid prolonged exposure to a line of communication. To achieve maximum surprise, the chicken should have performed this maneuver at night using NVG's, preferably near a road bend in a valley.<br><br>Air Combat Command:<br>The chicken should log this as a GCC sortie only if road-crossing qualified. The crossing updates the chicken's 60-day road-crossing currency only if performed on a Monday or Thursday or during a full moon. Instructor chickens may update currency any time they observe another chicken cross the road.<br><br>Tanker Airlift Control Center:<br>We need the road-crossing time and the time the chicken becomes available for another crossing.<br><br>Command Post:<br>What chicken?<br><br>Tower:<br>The chicken was instructed to hold short of the road. This road-incursion incident was reported in a Hazardous Chicken Road-Crossing Report (HCRCR). Please re-emphasize that chickens are required to read back all hold short instructions.<br><br>C-130 crewmember:<br>Just put it in back and let's go.<br><br>C-141 crewmember:<br>I ordered a no. 4 with turkey and ham, NOT chicken. Besides, where the heck are my condiments?! We ain't taking off til' I get my condiments!!!<br><br>Fighter dude:<br>Look, dude, that was the frag, OK? I've flown my 1.0 for the day and I ain't got time for anymore questions!<br><br>B-1 crew:<br>Missed the whole show--we had an IFE so we couldn't get out to see it; you'll have to ask the SOF.<br><br>Air Force Personnel Center:<br>Due to the needs of the Air Force, the chicken was involuntarily reassigned to the other side of the road. This will be a 3-year controlled tour and we promise to give the chicken a good-deal assignment afterwards. Every chicken will be required to do one road-crossing during its career, and this will not affect its opportunities for future promotion.<br><br>John Warden:<br>The chicken used its unique ability to operate in 2 dimensions to bypass the less important strategic rings on this side of the road and strike directly into the heart of the enemy, thereby destroying the will of the enemy to fight and thus ending the conflict on terms favorable to the chicken.<br><br>Congress:<br>The chicken will do anything to get the C-17 and the F-22.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Pierre, a brave French fighter pilot, takes his girlfriend, Marie, out for a pleasant little picnic by the River Seine. It's a beautiful day and love is in the air. Marie leans over to Pierre and says, "Pierre, kiss me!" Our hero grabs a bottle of Merlot and splashes it on Marie's lips.<br><br>"What are you doing, Pierre?" says the startled Marie. "I am Pierre, the famous French fighter pilot! When I have red meat, I like to have red wine!" She smiles and they start kissing. When things began to heat up a little, Marie says, "Pierre, kiss me lower."<br><br>Our hero tears her blouse open, grabs a bottle of Chardonnay and starts pouring it all over her breasts. "Pierre! What are you doing?", asks the bewildered Marie. "I am Pierre the famous French fighter pilot! When I have white meat, I like to have white wine!" They resume their passionate interlude and things really steam up.<br><br>Marie leans close to his ear and whispers, "Pierre, kiss me lower!" Our hero, grabs a bottle of Cognac and pours it in her lap. He then strikes a match and lights it on fire. Marie shrieks and dives into the river.<br><br>Standing waist deep, Marie throws her arms upwards and screams furiously, "PIERRE, what in the hell do you think you're doing?"<br><br>Our hero stands up, defiantly, and says, "I am Pierre the famous French fighter pilot! When I go down, I go down in flames!"<br></div>
