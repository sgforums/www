            <div class='col-md body'>From MINDEF - www.mindef.gov.sg<br><br>Singapore has sent three Republic of Singapore Air Force (RSAF) CH-47 Chinook helicopters from its Peace Prairie detachment in Grand Prairie, Texas, to assist in relief operations in the wake of Hurricane Katrina. The helicopters arrived at Fort Polk, Louisiana, on the afternoon of 1 September (local time). They are based in Fort Polk for their mission.<br><br>SingaporeÂ’s Chinook helicopters will be working closely with the Texas Army National Guard in their disaster relief operations. The RSAFÂ’s Chinooks will undertake resupply and airlift missions. Thirty-eight RSAF personnel, comprising pilots, aircrew and technicians, are deployed in this mission.<br><br>The RSAFÂ’s Peace Prairie detachment has worked together with the Texas Army National Guard on other relief missions in the past, including relief operations in the aftermath of Hurricane Floyd in North Carolina in 1999 and fire-fighting and flood relief operations in Texas in 2000.</div>

I mean when the tsunami hit the countries around Indian Ocean not long ago, but you don't see chaos at this sort of scale then. These countries are third world countries some more. There are reports of shooting at rescue workers ,policemen and helicopters. Our RSAF personnel in the rescue effort may be in trouble.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_eek.gif" alt="Shocked" title="Shocked"> </div></blockquote>Remember how the americans reacted when Michael Fay was canned? Our personnel should move out immediately if fired upon!! It is not worth risking our guys and our reputation doing a relief work. If the yankee were shot, they will never remember that our guys were there to help!!</div>
