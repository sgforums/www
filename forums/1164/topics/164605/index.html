            <div class='col-md body'>throughout the history of mankind, in all continents, wars were fought for territorial gains, for control of resources, for political reasons, for ideology, for religious faith, for freedom and protection and for some of the above reasons combined. Wars were never fought to bring peace.<br><br>Often war bring only temporary peace when the warring countries run out of means to fight and peace is broken soon as a country feel that they are strong. e.g. the germans in WW1 followed by WW2, the communists in north vietnam and north korea.<br><br>The only countries that can avoid wars are those who are strong against a strong adversaries, e.g. USA and USSR in the cold war, south korea against the north, israel against the arabs, even taiwan against china.<br><br>Peace is achieved by our ability to prevent a war, never by starting a war.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I have an idea, why don't i just argue my case here and then use some of your replies as reference articles. hahaha.<br><br>Sometimes, man forgets how precious peace is until its gone.  When peace is taken for granted, the society breaks down as people forget some of the values that were highly regarded in war.  Values such as loyalty, honor, and courage.  The onset of Peace I feel is often the onset of decadence to such values.  That is when society corrupts itself, reflected by rise in crime rate.  &lt;--- last sentence a smoke grenade <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br>Wouldn't such temporary peace at least remind us that we have to hold other values above selfish desires?<br><br>Examples of military organizations.  Institutions of violence and destruction. Yet they hold values such as loyalty, honor and courage above many organizations in peace-time society.<br><br>The writer Thomas Mann once wrote, "Is not peace an element of civil corruption and war a purification, a liberation, an enormous hope?"<br><br>Is the current peace, the type that will last?  Or would it simply decay itself into another war given enough time.  A war that would perhaps be more violent and more brutal, resulting in more bloodshed.  Is appeasement always the policy?  Don't you think multiple-small-scaled conflicts and skirmishes might actually ease tensions and perhaps alter the course of the future to avoid larger conflicts?<br><br>I suggest that if the allies, had taken Nazi-Germany' more seriously when she breached the Treaty of Versailles, the 2nd World War might not come about.  It was because the Allies chose not to take direct action, that resulted in the growth of Nazi-Germany's ambitions.  And if the Allies had not conceded Sudetenland and Czechoslovakia, and threatened to go to war immediately,  perhaps, the war would not have lasted as long as it did.<br><br>In today's context, I see the United States play a role in pre-empting conflict.  And it does so by creating smaller, but more restricted conflicts.  Conflicts that do not expand out of a certain geographical boundary.  Ever since the fall of Saddam's Iraq, majority of fighting and hostile actions has been localised in that country itself.<br><br>Perhaps, if the United States did not topple Saddam, combined with Iran's now transparent nuclear ambitions, a larger scale conflict might actually evolve in the middle east with in 10 years?<br><br>In short, would you have multiple small skirmishes, or a once in 50 year World War?  Knowing the capabilities of modern weaponry, destructive powers of WMADs, I would think a few small wars in a short span of time would be better off for the existence of humanity.  Peace? Lets enjoy it while it lasts.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hmm - interesting.<br><br>Without meaning to sound too fuzzy, the answer really does depend on what one defines as war, from which perspective the point is taken, and whether we are talking about actual war or the threat of war.<br><br>Let's look at the first point: what is defined as war?  Do tanks have to go rolling across front lines (the traditional definition of war), or could it be a case of terrorists letting off bombs once every 18 months (geurilla warfare), or one country strangling the sea routes to another (economic warfare)?<br><br>In the first case, the point doesn't stand - history has shown that in traditional military terms, the aggressor rarely wins in the long run.<br><br>In the second case, we have the instances of Israel and Vietnam as evidence.  These nation states exist owing to the actions of the Stern Gang and the Viet Cong respectively.<br><br>I raised economic warfare more as a mitigating factor than as a method.  Does one country need to engage in war with another in order to ensure its economic survival?  This of course leads to the second point - what was the objective of starting the war? Was it to set an imbalanced situation right?<br><br>The third point is the definition of war.  MAD and Singapore's defensive stance are examples of using the threat of war to maintain peace.  The first Gulf War and the two World Wars, on the other hand, are examples of using actual warfare to return to a peaceful situation.  In the former case, Sun Tzu's "the best war fought is one that is won without a single shot being fired" applies, while the old saying "we don't start fights, we just finish them" applied in the latter case.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>The Great War of 1914-1918 was to be the war to end all wars. That premise was broken in 1939, and there probably hasn't been a single day where there wasn't armed conflict somewhere on the globe.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I kinda like to go with the definition of war being an "armed conflict."<br><br>Peace would be "The absence of war or other hostilities. " or Freedom from quarrels and disagreement; harmonious relations.<br><br>However, in my arguement, peace would be subjective / relative.  War in Iraq, and Afghanistan, no major war elsewhere in the near future. Theoretical.<br><br>And the our ability to prevent war does not equate to peace.  Sometimes, trying to prevent war might actually make the inevitable war become more brutal, and of a larger scale.  Ref: Allies appeasement policy prior 1939.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Writing for a GP paper?<br><br>Touch on the bitter irony of this chicken and egg saga, then talk about  negotiation vs aggression and how successful each are and their strong points. Bring up examples such as the Oslo peace accords between Rabin and Arafat vs the subsequent Palestinian Intifada of 2000.<br><br>Bring up the UN and their superficial and largely glossed-over role in maintaining world peace, its ineffectiveness corruption and bureaucracy.<br><br>Bring up the issue of war (or the threat of war) which many perceive to be able to solve diplomatic issues between neighbours quicker and more effectively than negotiation. The Falklands campaign is a good example.<br><br>Use historical examples of the Roman empire to demonstrate unity through the sword and advancements such as currency and justice. And bring up the flip side of Ghengis Khan and his mongol tribes and how they brutalised the populations they subjugated from beijing to constantinople and the only innocents who suffer are civilians.<br><br></div>
