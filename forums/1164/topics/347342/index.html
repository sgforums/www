              <p>Read in  Nov / Dec 2008 Army News cover story " Wallaby '08 "  that 1 SIR used M113 APCs during the exercise.</p>
              <p> It was reported that the unit was " executing and practising the motorisation drills now......... before we acquire the <strong><em>actual platform</em></strong> ". </p>
              <p>I  assume that the <em>actual platform</em> will be the Terrex and that at least part of SAF's infantry battalions will be "motorised"  in the near future.</p>

            <div class='col-md body'><p>  I believe that the SAF plans to achieve motorisied infantry capabilities before further exploring on mechanised capabilities. What my definition of 'motorised' is that just having a armoured trooplift capability for infantry troops to reach their objectives faster, safer, etc. Ie, the drivers and gunners (if there is) for the vehicle (for now, the M113) aren't organic to the unit. <br><br>While, 'mechanised' is that the infantry troops have a armoured capability to assualt on their objectives. Ie, drivers and gunners and other possibile assets wld be organic to the unit itself.<br><br>Anyway, the Terrex rumour has been around for a few yrs already.</p></div>

              <p>For one thing, we know that the SAF doesn't do with sweeping changes overnight.  300 vehicles might be just the initial order.  There will be lots to iron out in terms of doctrine, as well as technical issues that may surface.  </p>

              <p>eh, i didnt mean to direct it in any way or any person. certaintly dont mean gd4u is a boy scout.</p>
              <p>i dont know the exact figures but it depends on your SAF infantry under what conditions, mission requirements and on what terrain. i mean, you definitely cant cover 100km in 3 days in Brunei. if you can do that, you probably are commando grade in terms of fitness.</p>
              <p>personal record was i walked about 40~45km in one day. usually its abit lesser given that our training areas in singapore dont exactly allow you to walk from point A to point B without making huge loops to achieve distance.</p>
              <p>and the thing is, map distance is just that. map distance. walking distance is usually much further.</p>

              <p>I dunno, but sgstars might have walked longer in a shorter time span than me. But for me, that particular 60km for me is no joke n i will continue to remember it. That is not the discussion here anyway.<br><br>BTT, the stryker and Terrex are quite close in their specifications (other than engine), I doubt the SAF would have 2 different vehicles that will raise their maintainence costs. There might be technical learning differences between them too. <br><br>I guess that the motorised infantry would have Terrex (if ordered) and Broncos for its battalion assets. The terrex just doesn't seem to hvae the capacity to load up assets stores and its troops as well. <br><br>Anyway, is the Terrex more spacious than the M113 or Bionix ???</p>

              <p>I believe Terrex has one of the largest ( 12.2 m3 ) internal volumes for similar type of vehicle.   Its carrying capacity is 12 + 2 crew  - hence shud be bigger than M113 and Bionix.</p>

              <p>i don't know if people just wanted this thread to die off, but it seemed really interesting, so i hope people dont mind if i revive it.</p>
              <p>i honestly believe the terrex would be the motorised platform of the future. one only needs to look at all our army camps and note that they're far away from each other, connected by roads, much like any other urbanised country. the benefits of the terrex is that it is wheeled, and locally made (or at least designed. somehow. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terrex mentioned timoney and turkey being involved). sure the stryker would be good for us, but i highly doubt we'd buy anything that has born the brunt of so much criticism after deployment in iraq.</p>
              <p>Being wheeled, training would not be compromised. any infantry bn can simply hop on the terrex, and do night movement to any of our distant training areas, with no worries about damaging the roads as per tracked vehicles (bronco, bionix etc). Being locally produced, we'd have a good say of how we want to configure the vehicle, to suit our needs, something that singapore likes to do very much.</p>
              <p>i believe the terrex was on display at the recent army open house/ airshow or something, cause i saw civilian pictures in the public domain SOMEWHERE. LazerLordz, you'd probably know, being in militaryphotos.net. everyone can see its interior and see how much comfortable it is as opposed to the M113.</p>
              <p>Sepacat, your point about having to dismount is very interesting. were you ex-AI?</p>
              <p>And my guys have actually sat inside one. it really is awesome. can anyone say aircon? (ADJUSTABLE aircon? hahahha) ;)</p>
              <p><br>On a sidenote, this whole MINDEF crackdown on army 'secrets' is <span style="text-decoration: underline;">totally understandable</span>, but really quite <span style="text-decoration: underline;">annoying</span>. what consituates a secret anyway? i'd love to share with you guys my experiences in the M113 (within opspec of course, i was from a motorised bn), but i'm seriously afraid of getting issued a charge sheet.</p>
