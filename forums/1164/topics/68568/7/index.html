            <div class='col-md body'>One day me and two of my recee team mates parked our jeep tactically in the dark at an exercise. We were exhausted! we are supposed to take turns to be awake, but in the end all become sound asleep. One was lying on the bonnet, another on the tool box and the last one on the vehicle commander seat. When is about first light, the one lying on the commander seat mumble, "Sir coming" and repeated it. But, none of us got the energy to get up until our Platoon commander come within 1 metre. He said "KNN", you all sleep CCB!" We still answered "no sir". Then he asked me (the MG gunner), where is your GPMG? I got down the jeep and digged into a batch bushes, "I kept it here, Sir". PC got so mad that all the three got confined for 3 weekends as a punishment.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>The post about having an enemy platoon 50m from own location reminded me of something that happened during Safincos.    A similar incident was shown in the movie "The Longest Day" on D-Day.<br><br>During section training, I was appointed section leader for the exercise.   After establishing the bivouac perimeter, I was to lead a combat patrol to find the enemy location.   At about 5pm, I lead my section in to a wooded area and we were walking as if we were on a hike, i.e. casually, as we did not spot anything suspicious.<br><br>All of a sudden, a few metres from me, I noticed a some bashas and a few soldiers cleaning their rifles - I guess in preparation for dusk standto.   When I looked around, I found out that I had lead my section right into the enemy platoons area!   My section mates and myself looked at one another and around, but we continued walking as if nothing is wrong.   Many of the enemy along the perimeter  closest to us looked at us too, but continued cleaning their weapon.<br><br>We managed to walk out of the enemy location without being captured or alarm raised :-)<br><br>On hindsight, I should have told my section to attack - we might have wiped out the whole platoon - after all, they cannot use their weapons!   I might have been awarded the Congressional Medal of Honor ;-)   (Oops, wrong country, no war LOL)</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>"Not really a cockup 15 - A batch of OCS cadets were undergoing an Arty course during the same period. In a training exercise, a cadet was holding on to an iron picket while his course mate were to hammer the iron picket into the ground with a monkey ram. The cadet was holding the iron picket too high up and when the monkey ram came down, all the fingers (I think only on one hand) were chopped off."<br>...yes, this case was quite famous when I was in TANCO course.  After that the instructors always tell us to use our foot to support the picket. Not the best method but the safest.<br><br>"Not really a cockup - The batch of OCS prior to the above incident had a cadet who got it worse. He was standing between the gun and the truck just before setting out for exercise. He was runned down by the gun when the truck moved off and died."<br>...yes, this case was the most famous in SOAY.  The staff sgt who was talking cock with me during one of the exercises with the ANCO for 120mm SP course actually got very emotional because he was there to witness it.  He was one of the instructors for that batch of cadets.</div>

So the instructor ordered group 1 (meaning me, the fella and the sect comd) to go back to collect the stuffs.  We were grumbling all the way and we were so sian that we low tactical.  then we just strolled into the clearing again w/o checking for danger.  and wow !! ... in the clearing was another section kana briefed by the instructor.  Oh crap ... enemy contacted.<br>both sides just look at each other stone stone, because both sides were low tactical.  and no one raied their rifles.  then me the garang one, i just tore off my thunder flash from my webbing, did not even bother to lit it and then shouted "Grenade !!" and threw it into the midst of the enemy section.  and I packed up my legs and ran out.  my other 2 fellas were not prepared for my action and were still glued to the ground.  after about 50m or so, I ran into the bushes in the side for cover and waited.  my 2 fellas did not come about and my instructor walked around shouting my name.  i came out, and got led to the clearing again.  kana scolded for throwing thunder flash into the enemy (not observing TSR).  kana scolded for not lighting thunder flash (this is funny leh ... TSR and lighting thunder flash).  kana scolded for not ensuring my sect cmd and friend corrdinated with my action.  so i thought ... that's it lah ... fali assessment in mission.  eh ... did not leh ... i only got scolded but the sect cmd failed the mission.  and the sect cmd got another round of tekkan with the enemy section.  the fella got back his bayonet and smoke ... and the 2 of us went back to the section and continued with the water collection.  my sect cmd got tekkaned good ... and only returned 1 hour later.</div>

During section leader training, one of my platoon mate somehow lost his rifle in Jln Ulu Sembawang and did not realise until later.   Whole platoon had to go back to training area at night to find it.   Luckily for him, it was found after a search.   Can't remember how many weekends extra he kana signed.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>i think there are 155 shots fired in singapore. probably direct shots firing thats what i heard. ok now for my cock up missions.<br><br>mission 1. ambush mission. i was the section leader for a ambush and after the usual thing we prep for we move out tot he ambush site. the time for the set up was before 0630 so that when it is around dawn, enemy came along and then we ambush them. reached the site at 0530. but were instead ambushed by the enemy that we were supposed to ambush. cos due to some planning cock up by the instructors, the time waschanged. i thought i would fail my assessment for sure. 'nvm' my instructor said 'go set up ambush and we will assess on the next group that come by'. so we fumble around in the dark. me being nightblind, unable to see anything at all in the dark. manage to position section and everything in the process but step over a couple of the guys in the process. lucky i quite small so they not so jialat. then set down peacefully for ambush. instructor sat beside me and started snoring really loudly. (this was the 4th msn in 3 days and we were really tired). seeing the instructor sleep, the whole section also cannot resist. at around 0710 i woke up and started pulling the comscord so that everyone could wake up. thankfully my instructor was still asleep. shortly after that he woke up and commented. while u ppl solid ah nvr slp. then the enemy came along and we ambushed them. msn declared successful and i did farely alright in my assessment. this is the most cock up msn i ever had. but heck it was successful.<br><br>mission 2. patrol. we were walking along this road in tekong and were suddenly attacked fromt the left. the left side was full of really tall grass the elephant type grass and was uphill. then we all prone. cant see a single enemy but kept being fired upon. section leader kept shouting 'can anybody see the enemy?' all of us goons said 'no'. then at this point my instructor knocked my helmet. 'ooiii u can stand up and see the enemy wat'. then i promptly replied 'but i would get shot at'. then she shouted at me again. 'but u got grass to camo u so enemy cant see u'. then i stood up. but due to my short height i couldnt see a single shit. then i quicklyy  prone down again. 'wat the f2ck are u doing?' she screamed. which i replied 'mdm the grass so tall i so short i really cant see anything'. got another knock on the helmet. 'ooiii u can jump wat )(*&amp;^%$#@!'. then i got up again and jump. i caught sight of the enemy and started yelling to my section leader 'I CAN SEE THE ENEMY LIAO I CAN SEE THE ENEMY LIAO!!!' this time i kenna knock again. 'wah lau u can see the enemy the enemy cant see u meh???' then i prone down and kept quiet. then again another knock. 'tell the section leader where is the enemy'. then i shout 'enemy front, 50m, one attend b with an m16,  charge!!!!' then i got knock again for incorrectly describing the enemy. Sigh u just cant please everyone....<br><br>Msn 3. ex battleking. was having a horrible time in thailand for my final ex b4 commissioning. a horrendous female instructor forbade all cadets from canteen breaks until the ex is officialy over. so at the exercise ground, everytime the kids came to sell drinks we had to reject. so sad to see them looking even sadder then us. then i was posted to the Observation post. there with one of the majors who was in charge, had a hell of a time. ran up and down the stairs to the OP to test the fastest time. anyway i was suppose to activate one of the fire code. like the infantry ppl would call for Estab nuke. so i did the usual code thingy and said ' toyota i say again toyota' 2 shots were fired. we heard it wheezing through the air heard it explode and couldnt see the rounds. everyone of us at the OP were straining our eyes against all the optical instruments trying like hell to find out where the rounds are. it clearly went over the ridge and then i radioed back 'stop i say again stop'. then that is when the battery ppl start to panic. while we at the OP were taking a break as no firing could commence while they check what the hell was the mistake. we ran up and down the stairs of the OP to get our 3  or 4 times ice cream break. while everyone in the OP was congratulating me on my luck and our god given ice cream. later it was found that the battalion recce offr didnt align the moving directors and the gun position was out. he was that cock up but yet went on to become the BNRO of the unit that he was posted to. it was hilarious.<br><br>oh ya then one of the sgt told us that we can exchange lightsticks with the kids for cans of cold drinks. lightsticks then became our currency for comodity.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I have heard that 155 were fired, but only very rarely, just to impress VIPs.   During my time no one in my battalion fired real 155 rounds in Singapore.   We did however, fired 14mm simulation rounds from our M71 in Safti.</div>
