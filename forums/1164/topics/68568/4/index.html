            <div class='col-md body'>When you get mired in mud, you must immediately stop struggling and spread out your free body weight horizontal to arrest the sinking. The first instinct tto struggle to free onself can be fatal. Struggling in mud will create a suction force which will pull you in deeper. To free the limbs, lift them up slowly enough that it slides within the mud without creating any suction. Once you are as horizontal as possible, inch slowly towards the closest solid ground and extract yourself slowly.<br><br>Moving fast in mud will compress the medium, force out the water infront of your body, leaving the solid particles and make the medium resist like a brick wall, holding you in a vicelike grip. Moving slowly allows the water within the mud to lubricate the individual mud particles in the slurry to slide past you without trouble.</div>
