            <div class='col-md body'>story 6 : ... just remembered<br>during my days as safincos instructor ...<br>there were a few topo exercises to cover ... ex. tenderfoot, nighthawk, etc ...<br>so the initiation one was tenderfoot ... 35k by day, 19k by night.<br>it was not the trainee section i was covering but my friend's.  his story was a classic.  that time we just joined 'B' company as instructors-in-training and were attached to the staff sgts to observe the training.  from time to time we were given the chance to take over the training sessions as some kind of on-job-training.<br>well, in ex tenderfoot, the friend of mine kana to man the command post for the exercise and during the night phase, 1 of the sgts got tired and asked him to cover his section for the last 2 check points.  wah ... happy lah ... go run around with the section in ulu sembawang in the night and act like damn garang like that.  topo by running and adrenaline.  then ... wah ... turned out that the section was actually lost.  they missed the last check point and actually had to back track to find it.  but my friend was trying to lead them to the next one.  so lanlan, had to back track 2 check points (about 8k) in the night and to make it worse, because the lobo manning the check point thought that the ex, was over (becos my friend when he reached the next check point reported in so the command post thought his was the last one), the lobo packed up the check point and returned to camp with the medic.  the poor section ended up searching for nothing and ... and... believe it or not ... my friend and the section got so disoriented that they got lost.  really bang balls.  all of us were back in camp by 1am and by the time we washed up and lock arms, were in bed by 2am.  my friend and that section came back at 5.30am ... just in time to fall in for 5bx and breakfast.</div>

Didn't know that the bunk was torn up...heheh. Somemore I was Section 2 so that should have been my bunk.<br><br>Cock up mission:<br><br>I was assigned as Platoon Sergeant for a mission. However, the platoon was added with another section (they missed that training so making up for it). So being the PS, I was moving out with section 5. The Platoon Commander, a staff sergeant, led us around the training area. But I think we got a bit lost or he took us on a really roundabout way. Along the way, it was planned (didn't know it until later) that the PC would be taken out i.e. casualty, and I would assume command for an assault up a slope. unfortunately, since we were already walking around for a while, most of the guys were shack out. Then when a halt was given, everyone just took cover and didn't pass the message down to me (at section 5) to come up to the front.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_redface.gif" alt="Embarassed" title="Embarassed"><br><br>Since no one passed the message down, I simply move out with the section 5 and eventually got separated as they were assigned the GPMP firebase role.<br><br>from the small knoll, I saw them i.e. the 4 sections, charge up and down and up and down the slope for at least 3-5 times.<br><br>When we regrouped, I found out that I had cocked up my assessment as I was not there to lead the platoon. Somemore, the  PC got fed up and start punishing the rest of the gang by making them, do all the charging (then  samulah!)<br><br>After being verbally abused, I was then assigned the medic role i.e additional gear of the medic load to do another patrol. Luckily, the thunder clouds came and the additional training was cancelled. (our OC was around).<br><br>What a sh-t day.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>oh hello fellow 'f-ing echo'.<br>Yah ... section 2 of the 2nd floor was torn up.  and becos of the impact, the roof started leaking real bad and during heavy rains, the roof will leak and all of us have to drag the beds to the middle of the bunk.  the water was like ... white water rafting down ...<br>and u can imagine the OC's office and the PC's office down stairs ... all have to be evacuated to ANTW (advance NCO trg wing behind.  we were all thinking ... man ... this is worse than tekong camp1.<br><br>oh while u were there, did you kana the infamous staff Raja (before defaulters parade, he'll make us do 100 counts of 8 of star jumps or 150 push ups - we can choose.  and he'll end the defaulters when at least 2 fellas faint from the tekkan) and Lt. Tan (the micro muscle, ultra maniac, super fit and loves to torture) ranger officer?  I can remember Lt Tan.  1st day only and he ordered his whole platoon to fall in.  we were green from tekong and fell in a little slow.  he not happy and asked all of us to run up and throw our cupboards from the 2nd floor down !!  and then bring up the mess to stand by cupboard.<br><br>but staff raja, staff cb tab and lt. Tan are really damn solid during missions.  you really learn the real art of patrolling and fighting and not just the theory part.  and they also sleep on the floor and eat the same crap as us during missions.  but back in camp ... woah ... better avoid them like anything.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Mine was defense ex in Tekong. After 2 days &amp; nites of trench digging, we set off for another mission on the 3rd day. However, we (84 sect) were told that we may be acting enemies. So, we left without our 84 guns. It's only  after crossing path with the trainers that we realised the big mistake. That was after walking for about an hour. As usual, our sect cmdr was screw upside down. We walked/ran back to our trench to carry our guns and rushed back to join our coy for the mission.<br><br>later on, we also found out that another coy didn't bring along their ET and whole coy was made to samulah. This was one of the most cock up Bn exercise and we were ranked bottom among the brigade.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>This one happened during signal nco course.<br><br>Supposed to do a final exercise - topo before graduation. Our route is only 30 plus clicks (can't remember exactly). Set out nice and early from Pasir Laba. My team was doing well i.e. first in the group. But when we were finishing and coming to the last check point, we found ourselves staring at this thick vegetation i.e. no check point. Bash and bash, no point, everyone radio back for instructions. PC come in his rover and realised that the check point was planned on paper i.e. didn;t really come to the ground to check. Then say he will create a new check point for us. Bloody cock up. So although he was in the wrong, he had the cheek to ask if we want to give up and take the rover (we were still the first team). Of course, we wanted to finish the bloody thing, so we just ngeh ngeh lai. By the time we finished, I think the actual route became 50klick just becos someone didn;t bother to do a proper check before we started.<br><br>The joke was, we  were still the first to reach camp stagmont. The other platoon all got lost somewhere in Mandai which was supposedly harder to topo. So in the end, they also sort of "extended" their own routes.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Funny stories everyone! I had many good laughs...my turn:<br><br>Story One: We were practicing heli-exfil at LCK one time after a week-long recce mission. As per standard practice, once the Pumas arrived, we ran towards the helo from a "10 &amp; 2 o'clock" angle. Got this guy in my team who was damn tall and big-sized...he was the SAW gunner. He was the last one to board the chopper since he dropped something from his full pack and went to retreive it. So we could see him running from a short distance away, and the pilot acting guai-lan, turned around and told us to tell that guy to hurry up...<br><br>So we shouted "Hurry up", "Faster", "Chop chop", etc....and my teammate came running like mad dog, macam Ben Johnson on 3 doses of steriods, and jumped into the chopper....but he forgot to lower his head, and knocked his head (lucky got helmet) at the top of the cabin compartment All we heard was a sudden loud "THUD" and he practically flew backwards towards the grass lying on the ground...panting like gonna die...our jaws also dropped open...my Plt Sgt who happened to be on the same chopper with us shouted "OOI !! Waiting for what?! Go and see if he's ok lah?!!"<br><br>I ran out to him (still lying flat on his back, with the full pack to one side and still holding on to the SAW).."ooi XXX, you ok or not?" His reply: "uhh...yeah..I'm fine...thought I saw angels laughing at me (He's Catholic) "<br><br>The air crew all laughed like siow....<img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br><br>Story Two: this happened during my Gds ACT. We finally reached the test day of rappelling and headed off to Sembawang Air Base to do it. Being the amateurs we are, (not to mention the initial fear of height) my section was pretty hyped up and scared at the same time when we boarded the chopper. So as usual, the pilot brought the chopper up to the required altitude and we went down in two pairs, each by one door.<br><br>If I still remember, the trick is to simply release your braking hand and slide down a bit, so as to clear the doorway, but never to "jump off"...these two jokers in my section were so scared that they won't clear the door that they pushed off hard to swing out. What happened was typically comical...since the downwash was pretty strong, and that they pushed off, both jokers came swinging towards each other like two colliding pendulums and swung smack into each other. One of the guy's leg managed to kena the other joker's nuts....My OC from above was yelling with the megaphone (not required for him actually) : "HOI !!!! CCB!! WHAT THE F**K ARE YOU ALL DOING!?!!"  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_twisted.gif" alt="Twisted Evil" title="Twisted Evil"><br><br>Needless to say, the pilot and co-pilot nearly died laughing...becos of those two jokers we kenna guard duty for two weeks....sigh.... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hi There..found ur website by chance last week..So here is mine cock up mission<br><br>Happen last year during our ICT for Patrolling for installation (POI)of Clementi Camp (next to the indutrial park)  .AS part of the duites all vehicles were stopped before a stop spikes, an excersie vheicle was acting as a bomb truck and was cordoen off to 1 area, the civilian vehicle (Lexus) immediaelty behind it getting impatient tot the sgt was waving him to go, (actually the guy was asking him to stop). The poor guy in the lexus just step on the gas ..hehe bang the 1st 2 front tire just could take the spikes..the comms was just yelling and the CO was running toward the guard post.The commotion lasted for 1/2 hr as the guy was agruing with the CO and sentries on duties who shld pay..he lost in the the end.. later in the afternoon there was another vehicles and a motorcycles that was also "stopped" in the same way. the latter had to atted by the MO <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br><br>The next was the unit before us and it happen. Any one working at Clementi Indutrial park? , went for the briefing for POI and the conducting officer (Maj i think) was not at all happy, he keep telling us not to challenge anyone outside the compond, It turns out that the previous units as contacted by the acting enemy outside the camp at 11++pm , the reservist so garang that they chase all the way into the next road and the enemy in turn fire back. Imagine u working late and all of a sudden GPMG and thunderflash..someone call the police and 1 patrol car came, had to call for more cars as they didnt expect to see the firefight..in the end the brigade chief has to come back to camp to settle all this..</div>
