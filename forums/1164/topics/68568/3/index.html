But sometimes ah ....<br>It was nearing the end of the fiscal year and we normally had to burn the remaining funds of the budget. (yah ... its true ... when you have excess $$ left, you just spend.  Upgrade the loo, the lighting, the paint job, anything.  all the tax payers $$ go bye bye).  well, we had about another $800k left, so my S4 asked the QM to do something about it.<br>The QM had good intentions lah ... he kit exchanged the hole Bn's uniform.<br>take a few seconds to sink in....<br>.... it costs about $600k for that request alone.<br>wah ... all the other departments of course wanted to back side butter him.

Looks like we may have covered some of the same ground, Wombat.<br><br>Had a similar situation, but thank God I landed in a dried out rice paddy.  Ended up knee deep in soil that had a consistency like ash - damned softest landing I ever had!  The guy in front of me in my stick landed in mud and the next couple of guys landed in a pineapple plantation - they came out scratched and bloodied, but all had grins on their faces because they scored the pineapples they landed on.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br><br>That turned out better than another overseas jump I did - the people in the village next to the DZ saw the Charlies coming and decided to come and watch the show.  I exited the aircraft, got into good para position and saw a multicoloured field instead of green - the buggers were right under me.  I shouted down for them to clear the area, and by the time I found a clear spot I was less than 30 feet above the ground, right over a rocky spot.  Braced myself for a hard landing and crunch - I broke a tooth.  I forgot about it soon enough, though - we ran into one of the villagers who had a 12-gauge shotgun, borrowed it from him and were having too much fun checking it out.</div>
