            <div class='col-md body'>something similar happened in my OCS course also.  My appointed PC during a platoon fighting patrol mission ran forward when the platoon was contacted, to assess the situation.  He ended up, along with his medic-appointed, right in front of a very well camo MG position.  so the instructor declared both of them KIA and me, the platoon sgt kana to take over the platoon in the patrol.<br>actually come to think about it, KIA also not bad.  Can be hammocked back all the way to camp ... cock lah<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by -=hellfire=-:</div><div class="quote_body">Hi all,<br>Mine goes like this.. We had this defence exercise, where we dug in,  Mob4(??!!?), in the afternoon heat.

So here comes our gung ho reinforcements in the form of the mg-gunner and assistant. Who doubled to my trench, stand in the open (bua long long) and asked "Hey, where's the enemy huh??" As we weren't issued with the dioptic inserts for our masks, so we had to make do without any glasses on.. And due to the cold weather, the mask ALWAYS fogged up. So vision was really errr..... blurred. So as all might have guessed, the mg-gunner and assistnant were downed.. without firing a single shot on his mg. LOL.<br><br>Next came the PC and his runner. he's more tactical... He squated behind a tree, just 5-10m IN FRONT of the enemy, turn around and asked "Wheres the enemy huh?".. Before his runner can ans, they're pronounced 'dead'.<br><br>S3 witnessed the whole ordeal where weÂ—entrenchedÂ—lost out to just one section of enemies.. He was fuming mad boy...

            <div class='col-md body'>Some of the incidents here are eerily similar to those I have experienced, especially vleelee's.   Maybe the same cockups occur over and over again because those who experienced it had ROD'ed leaving the fresh NS people to cockup themselves.<br><br>vleelee talked about smallpox interupting his training - I was in Tekong doing BMT donkey years ago (early 80's) when some in a company (I think it was E Coy) got smallpox.   The whole island was quarantined and we were not allowed to go back to Singapore for a month and training continued.   However, the lucky people who got the smallpox did not have to training, and what is more, they get to go back to Singapore to the medical facilities for checkups.<br><br><b>Cockup 1</b> vleelee also talked about a trainee acting as section commander charging up a hill alone in Safincos.   During my Safincos training, in a section training exercise, another trainee was acting as the section leader leading us on a patrol.   The enemy was in a knoll and we leap frogged half-way up the knoll when the section leader gave the order to charge.   However, most of us were very shacked at that time and did not move leaving the section leader to charge up to the top of the knoll screaming 'charge' all the way.   When he reached the top and looked around, found out he was the only one, gave a loud 'aaarrrggghhh' and 'die', fell back with arms and legs wide apart and played dead.<br><br><b>Cockup 2</b>In another section training exercise in Safincos, my section was charging up a hill with bayonets fixed when the person behind me tripped.   His bayonet tip penetrated my uniform and poked me on my back, luckily without drawing blood.<br><br><b>Cockup 3</b>I was an M71 gun commander during NS days.   During deployment, we had to run in front of our 7-ton MAN truck towing the M71 to lead the vehicle to the site (I remember times when we had to run a couple of hundred metres with truck chasing after me).   At the last couple of days of the Battalion's proficiency test exercise,  we had to deploy in the early morning, and boy was I tired and sleepy.   Anyway, I got out of the truck and started running on an unpaved tracked in front of truck.   My driver was driving quickly because timing is critical to pass the test.   All of a sudden, I felt rumbling just behind me and realised that the heavy vehicle and gun was almost upon me.   I just managed to siam on time to avoid being runned over.   I have to say that my driver was not entirely at fault.   Admittedly, he was also tired and sleepy and therefore not as alert as he should be.   The problem was that I fell asleep when running !!! (I didn't realise that anyone can be as tired as that :-)<br><br><b>Cockup 4</b>The battery convoy stops just outside the deployment area so that the commanders can disembark and lead their vehicles to their positions.   We were travelling fast because timing for the deployment was taken.   It was raining, the area was wet and muddy and my 7-tonner could not stop on time crashing into the M71 in front demolishing the pneumatic rammer.   I understand it cost over 20k to replace.   SAF have this funny habit of charging the driver and vehicle commander when anything happens.   I expected to be seeing a guardroom from the wrong side, but fortunately, my battery commander (BC) did not take action against me.   However, my driver was charged and ended up in the guardroom.<br><br><b>Cockup 5</b>This happened in Thailand or Taiwan (can't remember which).   Something was wrong with that M71 assigned to me and I received a lot of flak from my BC during live firings.   For some reason, when the gun is fired, it rocked and behaved a little bit like a see-saw; obviously the accuracy of the live firing leaves a lot to be desired.   The BC thought that the trail spade was not emplaced deep enough so we dug deeper and deeper, without solving the problem.   During one deployment, my gunners lifted up the trail (in this days of mechanisation, who would believe that we use man-power to operate a 9ton piece of equipment) which normally requires a lot of effort.   But on this occassion, the gun was light and did not stop going up when we stopped lifting.   The result is that the muzzle brake touching the ground while the two trails pointed up at the heavens ;-).   Now that it had been established that my detachment was not at fault, but the gun's, I stop receiving flak from my BC.<br><br><b>Cockup 6</b>During the convoy movement in a battery exercise, we were travelling past Khatib Camp when Gun 3, which was not properly hookedup to the 7ton truck detached itself from the truck and slammed onto the road in the middle of the junction.   Taffic had to be blocked off for a few minutes to allow the gun to be hooked up again.<br><br><b>Cockup 7<b>My battery had the responsibility of operating the 25pounder during the 21 gun salute in National Day.   During a rehersal, one of the 25pounders became unhooked from the LandRover in a traffic junction near Hougang.   Unlike the previous incident, we do not have to stop the traffic to hook up the gun because the gun is light and because of the LandRover's speed.   After the gun detached, it slammed onto the road and obliging move by itself (through momentum) past the junction to the stopped LandRover :-)<br><br><b>Cockup 8</b>In a battalion exercise, in another battery, a gun commander was appointed acting battery sergeant-major (BSM) and had to lead his convoy to the deployment area (near Woodlands).   Unfortunately for him, he got lost and led his convoy of 4 guns to the causeway, went past immigration before he can make a U-turn.   The Malaysians must have gotton a shock to see a Singapore Artillery battery on the causeway :-), especially it was a period of tension when some Isreali big shots visited Singapore.<br><br><b>Not really a Cockup 9</b>In another message, someone posted about people stuck in the mud.   During a battery exercise, one of our officers was walking around the deployment area in Simpang.   Arty deployment grounds were typically wide open muddy places.   Unwittingly, he veered off to the side of the track and sank up to his waist in very soft mud and was unable to move.   A few of the guys had help him out.<br><br><b>Cockup 10</b>I was involved in weapon testing in Project L****n conducted in Thailand.   The 155 *** gun was test fired.   On one occassion, instead of the barrel just recoiling, the barrel rotated from about 45 degrees to about 70 degrees before coming to a rest about -5 degrees.   The bolts on the trunnion had sheared off during the firing.<br><br><b>The next three cockups happened in Thailand during battalion FATEP (an artillery test that involves live firing that determines our combat readiness).   It was our first live firing exercise and that there are cockups is not surprising</b><br><br><b>Cockup 11</b>During the test, on one live firing mission, all the guns except for mine were ready.   My gun had problems with the main sight, and we had to use a spare sight.   However, the spare cannot be secured firmly and so I had to waste time getting another standby from the command post.   All this time, my BC was repeatedly calling for "Gun 1, check ready".   My layer install the sight, laid the gun to the specified line and quadrant, and I reported ready.   The safety NCO performed a cursory check on the laying but I was so pressured at the time that I did not check on the layer.   Immediately after my gun fired we were ordered to 'standfast', meaning that everyboby in my detachment was to act as mannequins (i.e. not allowed to move).   Officers came to my position and performed a check.   Apparently, the forward observer, positioned up a hill looking at the target area had heard the whining of the 155 round as it flew past his location and called for a 'stop' (he should not be close enough to hear the passge of the shell).   It was found that while the settings on the sight was correct, the sight was not secured properly (a few degrees deviation can mean that the impact is kilometers away from target).   It took them a few hours to find the impact area as the FO was focused on the target area, and the shell had landed elsewhere (maybe he had his head down when he heard the shell coming!).   My shell had apparently landed in a padi field and took out a cow in the process.   Needless to say, I felt down and worried for the rest of the exercise anticpating a charge and spending time in the guardroom.   Fortunately, my BC and the CO did not take further action.   (Wheww :-)<br><br><b>Cockup 12</b>Gun 2 was the pivot piece and as such they fire the most shells.   The normal procedure is that once a gun is laid, we wait for the GPO to order to fire.   However, in this occassion, the gun commander fired the shell immediately after loading without the order to be given.   Gun 2 commander was chastised but luckily, was not charged.   The had to fire an additional round because the FO did not anticipate the firing and therefore did not see where the round landed.<br><br><b>Cockup 13</b>Gun 4 was given the order to load.   It was during the test and timing is important.   Just after the order to fire was given, gun 4 commander realised that the wrong charge was loaded (the charge comprises bags of propellant (explosive) that determines, along with the angle (quadrant), how far the round goes).   He checked with the safety officer, who happened to be our RSM.   For some reason, the RSM asked the commander to fire, and the round obviously landed in the wrong position (don't know if it was over or short of target).   The RSM was almost charged for this incident (ALMOST).<br><br>The battery commander,a captain then, was a nice guy, a scholar who was seldom in battery line because he had some duties with regards to the President.   He is now a high ranking General holding a top post in Mindef.<br><br><b>Not really a cockup 14</b>During the ANCO (Arty NCO) course one of the fellow trainee was operating the breech blok of the M71when it closed, chopping off the index finger.   When we opened up the breech block, his finger was found, but cannot be reattached.   He was downgraded and became a clerk in the school.<br><br><b>Not really a cockup 15</b>A batch of OCS cadets were undergoing an Arty course during the same period.   In a training exercise, a cadet was holding on to an iron picket while his course mate were to hammer the iron picket into the ground with a monkey ram.   The cadet was holding the iron picket too high up and when the monkey ram came down, all the fingers (I think only on one hand) were chopped off.<br><br><b>Not really a cockup 16</b>The batch of OCS prior to the above incident had a cadet who got it worse.   He was standing between the gun and the truck just before setting out for exercise.   He was runned down by the gun when the truck moved off and died.<img src><img src></b></b></div>

Personally, I don;t think this type of 'minor' infraction that has no consequence to civil law would or should have much effect on civilian life.<br><br>However, after my ROD, I had worked with a labourer for a few years who was an army regular sergeant who killed someone outside of camp.   He was convicted of manslaughter, jailed in a civilian jail and given the rotan.   He was also discharged from the SAF, and I think he lost his pension.   His criminal record will stay with him for life (oh, I think a recent change in law allows his record to be erased after a period of time - one hundred or so years later if I remember correctly.)   Anyway, he cannot leave Singapore, and employment is problematic - that's why he ended up as a labourer.</div>

My gun had problems with the main sight, and we had to use a spare sight. However, the spare cannot be secured firmly and so I had to waste time getting another standby from the command post. All this time, my BC was repeatedly calling for "Gun 1, check ready". My layer install the sight, laid the gun to the specified line and quadrant, and I reported ready. The safety NCO performed a cursory check on the laying but I was so pressured at the time that I did not check on the layer. Immediately after my gun fired we were ordered to 'standfast', meaning that everyboby in my detachment was to act as mannequins (i.e. not allowed to move). Officers came to my position and performed a check. Apparently, the forward observer, positioned up a hill looking at the target area had heard the whining of the 155 round as it flew past his location and called for a 'stop' (he should not be close enough to hear the passge of the shell). It was found that while the settings on the sight was correct, the sight was not secured properly (a few degrees deviation can mean that the impact is kilometers away from target). It took them a few hours to find the impact area as the FO was focused on the target area, and the shell had landed elsewhere (maybe he had his head down when he heard the shell coming!). My shell had apparently landed in a padi field and took out a cow in the process. Needless to say, I felt down and worried for the rest of the exercise anticpating a charge and spending time in the guardroom. Fortunately, my BC and the CO did not take further action. (Wheww :-)</blockquote>i've heard about this one!!!<br><br>my tuition teacher told me about this one arty piece, he was assigned to. he was an arty officer. anyways, he says once, during an ex in taiwan, someone else was in command of the arty piece, and the sighting was wrong. they fired the shell and overshot, so they went to search for the shell, finally found it in the padi rice fields. so u were the one in command of that arty piece?!<br><br><blockquote>Originally posted by dragonstar:<br><b>Not really a cockup 16</b>The batch of OCS prior to the above incident had a cadet who got it worse. He was standing between the gun and the truck just before setting out for exercise. He was runned down by the gun when the truck moved off and died.</blockquote>heard about this one too! in fact it was that same piece of arty that he commanded! but this happened b4 he got command of it. he told us they needed to scrape the guy off the ground....<br>*shiver*</div>
