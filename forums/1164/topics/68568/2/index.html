The trg officer and the chief of staff called up the CO and ... after a lengthy verbal assault, asked the whole Bn to pay up.  ok lah ... money no problem ... but where to buy the plants, and foliage back?<br><br>called and called and finally got the primary production board to sell us vegetation.  not cheap eh ... each man in the Bn had to fork out $60 odd.  but the next few dets and Bns that went into the trg area had an easy time.  the M113 can be a realy good lawn mower.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Some outfits take the close shaves with death in their stride,one of my friends, Guards recon were driving around Tekong in an open topped Land Rover along with two commandos, about 20-40 kph above the allowed speed limit for some perverse reason. They took the turn too hard, lost control and went straight into a ditch at top speed, propelling the two commandos and guardsman into the jungle off the road while it flipped over and got stuck in the ditch.<br><br>Amazingly, nobody was seriously injured and could walk from the crash, not long later, a Col. comes along in his own land rover and asks laidback, what happened, they immediately cook up a cover story on how a speck of dust got into the driver's eye at high speed, causing him to lose control.<br><br>At the same time, the medic which arrived on scene, miffled that he has no job to do, makes lame jokes about IVing the pengsang jeep, which was completely undamaged, safe a dent in the bumper.

            <div class='col-md body'>Similar to this LAN cable. Our experience was with our fiber cables. We were on a 2 week division exercise. Since we were in Division, we tend to lay our cables all over the place.<br><br>Sometimes, the brigade side hq also nearby.<br><br>So when the exercise was cut. One of the very on brigade linesmen tore down all their d10. Since they did not recognize our fiber, they assume it was from enemy. So they proceeded to cut thru the thick cable with their puny wire cutters.<br><br>No matter, they managed with enuff tenacity to cut the thousand over dollar drum of fiber. Luckily all there was for us was just a BOI and writeoff. (U can repair fiber but the quality will never be the same again).</div>

Most of the weight came from it's reinforced gigantic monitor to allow the top brass to see it from afar... Apparently nobody in R&amp;D thought of using a projector instead of a screen!<br><br>Anyway, that thing was so tough that it could probably survive being hit by bullets or a near miss by an arty shell... it could do anything but work. The IBM PC was slow, the software was buggy and it hung frequently... what's worse, the 200 dollar keyboard cable tended to get loose if you pulled it too hard and the only way to plug it back in was to take the unit apart!<br><br>True to Dilbert principals, when the keyboard cable got loose, my friend would usually carefully push the wire back in, put the tray back, and wait for the next user (preferably a rookie) to come along, and the moment the person pulled out the keyboard tray to use the keyboard, the cable would come lose and all the Signals guys over there will go "Wah lau! Look at what you do!" Usually the hapless rookie would actually be suckered into fixing the keyboard cable, a tedious job nobody wants to do.<br><br>Of course, that was if that thing could work or even get to battle in the first place, especially the version which weighted 1 ton and needed it's own transport unit... usually the smaller version would take a lot of the Singals guys to lug around while the other guys are yelling at them to hurry up and set up that thing. And of course, that thing usually failed to live up to expectations and long strings of hokkien vulgarities would often be heard in the night. One night, one guy got so fed up he kicked the thing right off the back of a 3 tonner, creating a crash that sounded like a bomb going off and that thing actually survived!<br><br>Of course, this thing actually went on an exchance programme to Taiwan, and the Signals unit had to wayang a lot to make it look good, as they were ordered...<br><br>Rumour has it that these battle computer units are siting in storage in some military base waiting for use in a time of war... considering the battlefield computing equipment we have now, my signals friend is not optimistic that anyone might use it at all.<br><br>Except for armour plating, of course.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>The mother of all screwups that I've seen has to be a demonstration mass drop at Tuas - a whole lot of Mindef brass were there to watch.  The pallet on which the Mercedes jeep is dropped has 3 parachutes.  Damn thing rolled of the Charlie ramp and only one opened.  One of the boys was on the ground packing up his chute, heard a rushing noise and dived aside just in time to keep from getting squashed.  Write off one Merc and one mounted Milan system.  That was not a good day for 3rd transport.<br><br>Abseiling practice during BCT, doing a casualty rappel.  My buddy was not the most height-loving kind of guy, and I was tied to his back as the casualty.  He slipped while getting into L-shape and let go of the rope.  Next thing I knew I was looking 8 floors up at the ground - he weighed 85kg, I weighed 65, and we both landed on my back on the cliff.  Anyway, the safety line got wrapped around my leg and as my buddy kept flailing about, it got tighter and tighter.  I headbutted the back of his head (good thing we were both wearing helmets at the time), and it was enough to stun him.  I told him to keep still, called up to the safety line belayer and asked him to give me some slack while I untangled my leg.  Once I did that, I told my buddy to plant his feet on the cliff and walk, not bounce, down the cliff.  I left it up to my platoon sergeant to tear a few strips off the guy, but when I got back to barracks that night, I checked my back and saw that I had a bruise on my back from my shoulders to my hips.<br><br>Company exercise in Singapore.  The three platoons were to approach the target from separate directions.  My PC decided that he wanted to cut across this gravel pile which was about 2 storeys high.  We got up to the top, going two steps forward and one step back, and found hat the bush on the other side was too thick to cut through quickly.  I did a quick recce and reported that it was the same all along the length of the gravel pile.  The PC insisted on trying another spot, and by the time we were done, we had gone up and down four times without finding a break.  Eventually we skirted around the pile and the bush, as I recommended originally, and got to the target an hour late.  Needless to say, the OC did not take kindly to this and the PC was assigned a whole pile of extras.  Anyway, on the way back, I referred to the PC as Wally Weenie the Wonderschmuck, and the name stuck.  For the rest of his tour with us, whenever anybody was looking for the PC, they would ask Â“WhereÂ’s Wally?Â”.<br><br>Night FIBUA exercise in Serimbun.  We were the guinea pig batch for MindefÂ’s study into the effectiveness of issuing each man with a laser sight.  The sight we used had a bracket that was bolted on to the barrel of the weapon, with the laser emitter sliding on and fastened by quick-release levers (similar to the ones found on bicycle wheel hubs).  Anyway, went tom the first room, activated the laser, saw the red dot and fired.  Same thing happened with the second room.  Got to the third room, hit the activation button and got nothing.  I checked my weapon and found that the sight had dropped off because the quick release lever was worn down.  Anyway, we had to call for exercise cut, hit the lights and find the damned thing Â– it cost $1400 and damned if I was going to sign a 1206 for that.<br><br>LRRP exercise in Brunei.  In our team we had two snipers, but one of the section commanders pulled rank and insisted on navigating.  We walked for 5 hours, did a position check and found that we were only 2 klicks from where we started Â– the bugger had gone around in a circle.  We took a break and one of the boys whipped out his camera Â– I still have the photo of the lot of us looking exhausted and pissed off, with the section commander looking somewhat sheepish.  Anyway, when we started off again, the snipers did the navigation and got us there within an hour and a half.<br><br>Same LRRP exercise.  The mission was to look out for a Land Rover with a cross on the side, and report the number written on the canvas cover.  After a day and a half, a Rover appeared, but it didnÂ’t have the cross.  Two majors and a colonel got out of the Rover and poked around in the bush for about half an hour, then got back in and took off.  We sent a report, but it wasnÂ’t relevant to the exercise anyway.  I caught up with an old school mate who was an OCS instructor, and I asked him if he knew anything about it.  As it turns out, some OCS cadet had his rifle stolen while he was asleep Â– the weapon was later recovered at a nearby village.  The cadet was an SAF scholar, so he didnÂ’t get much more than a reprimand.</div>
