They shared money to buy lottery and kena the top prize and it was during one of the live firing exercise that the results was announced and they asked the dyty clerk to check the results. After they realise that they had the winning ticket, instructed the clerk to safe keep the ticket in OC's office vault while waiting for them to come back. Each of them paid for a new car after that  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"></div>

Oh dear - I can't imagine what the mission briefing was like.  Was it a single-mission exercise or was it in the middle of a bigger exercise.  In the former case, that's just seriously wrong.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hi all,<br>Mine goes like this.. We had this defence exercise, where we dug in,  Mob4(??!!?), in the afternoon heat. Held our positions and awaiting some enemies' attacks..<br><br>My trench contacted heavy enemy fire power, and so we comms for support... So here comes our gung ho reinforcements in the form of the mg-gunner and assistant. Who doubled to my trench, stand in the open (bua long long) and asked "Hey, where's the enemy huh??" As we weren't issued with the dioptic inserts for our masks, so we had to make do without any glasses on.. And due to the cold weather, the mask ALWAYS fogged up. So vision was really errr..... blurred. So as all might have guessed, the mg-gunner and assistnant were downed.. without firing a single shot on his mg.
