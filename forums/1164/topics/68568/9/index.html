            <div class='col-md body'>ok ... ok ... 19th SSL batch SAFINCOS Echo company guys should know this.<br><br>we were on platoon mission and the instructors really tekkaned us bad from the moment we dropped off the tonner into ulu sembawang.  So in the night, 1 fella (who kana sect. cmmd appt) who just came back from his mission, and did not really fare very well in the evaluation, was ordered by the instructor to do a powder bath.  I don't really know the reason why lah ... i also kana sect cmmd appt for another section.<br><br>and in the midst of the powder bath ... we got contacted by another platoon.<br><br>can you imagine another more 'suay' moment for that fella ?<br><br>sbo, helmet, MILEs, rifle, boots, everything .... everything ... all off.  and looking white as a ghost ... and kana contacted.  how to  be more suay.<br><br>and kana sect cmmd some more ... so how ?  run back naked to section to assume command or what ?  how ?<br><br>and i was organising my section into fighting position and awaiting my PC's orders.  then i saw him.  the instructor also didn't care.  so the fella asked if i could help him.  huh ?  how to help him?  he asked if i can help him gather his items so he can put them on faster.  i told him i am sect cmmd leh ... got section to worry about.  he looked around (his own section was pretty far away lah ... ) so ... what to do ... started dressing up. (p.s. incidentally ... by the time he finished dressing up, the platoon was ordered to relocate ... damn the MILEs lah).  i tell you ... all the sections that had to 'movement' past him ... were shaking heads and sniggering at the same time.<br><br>this was not the most cock up some more.  during the contact, the instructors intervened in the fire and movement and somehow, 2 of the sections were facing each other and were 'firing' away.  the sect cmmds knew this and told the instructors but ... aiyah ... that time who had guts to question the instructors one.  the PC and our CSM saw this some more ... PC became very angry.<br><br>Our PC was howling his voice out for the sect cmmds to gather and that fella was still trying to put his MILEs on.  When we gathered, the PC asked why there was 1 section that was commandered by a 2 i/c and where the bonkers did the sect cmmd go.  the fella raised his hand and replied that he was the sect commander but also could not atriculate why he was absent from the whole fire fight.  then the instructors got tekkaned, and the sect commanders got tekanned (and kana extras when we returned to camp), and the platoon was made to run up and down a hill casavacing casualties the whole friggin' night (because we screwed up the contact).<br><br>sigh .... last time is like this one ... trainees go in the mission blurr, get tekanned and come out blur blur also.  did not learn anything, just get screwed.</div>
