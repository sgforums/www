            <div class='col-md body'>Heard this funny one from my friend...he heard it from a retired LTC..<br><br>This LTC was in charge of this particular mission helded at Lim chu kang, which involves three platoons..2 good ones and one bad one...Well, the good forces were supposed to capture this bridge heavily guarded by the enemy. The plan is that, one will attack from the front first and the other will attack the enemy from the back....then overwhelm the enemies and capture the bridge.<br><br>The good forces which attacked from the front did something wrong during their moving out..(i think they reached there too slow)so their PC samura the whole thing and they have to go back to where their initial position to start the whole thing all over again..so happened that the signaller forgot to tell the other 2 platoon abt this!<br><br>The forces which attacked from behind later on were shocked to find that they were outnumbered by the enemy!(coz the one attacking from the front havent reach yet). So they fought and fought....until dunno how the heck they reach near the HDB blocks....they(the good guys from behind) were so desperate that they started using GPMG, which woke up those who were zzzz in their HDB blocks!<br><br>Later on after the exercise, the retired LTC found out abt this from his superior(the people zzz complained abt the GPMG fire) and was told to investigate...hee <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Seems wasted if this thread is left alone. Got too many priceless stories here. Want to laugh but must restrain myself here in office.<br><br>Got one real-life story from my uncle. Exact origin unknown but a funny one. Not exactly a mission but a training exercise, a night one to be exact. Ok, here goes.....<br><br>One night, a particular company was conducting night training in their respective sections. During the training, the section commander decided to check the strength of the section just to be safe. He signalled the second man and whispered "number". And then he waited while the man passed it down the section to the last.<br><br>After waiting for some time, no reply came. Section commander puzzled, so decided to try again. He whispered "number" again and the second man dutifully passed it on. Still no reply??  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_confused.gif" alt="Confused" title="Confused">  Section commander now worried so decided to do head count himself down the section. One, two, ...., seven. All present. Now section commander pissed off  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_evil.gif" alt="Evil or Very Mad" title="Evil or Very Mad">  and asked last man what message he got. The last man whispered "....". "WHAT!!! NA BEI?!?!?!"   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_eek.gif" alt="Shocked" title="Shocked"> <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>hi all,<br><br>Back in 94, my coy used to have this training somewhere in Khatib near the golf course. We were deployed among the bushes between the reservoir and nearby hdb flats. It was nearly midnight when we were "contacted", We fired like nobody business and i can hear my gpmg rounds echo through the entire neighbourhood. It was then I noticed some hdb units light up simultaneously as if all just woke up in the morning. While we were collecting the cartridges, we were "contacted" again. Only this time, it's by 4 police cars by the road. Can you imagine the tension we caused! Some folks must have thought some war just started and called the police. My OC with camo and helmet still on, took out his IC and hand it to the officer. Come to think back, I really don't know wtf we were doing in hdb area doing firing. Guess that was the last mission ever conducted at such locations.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Heard this from my friend.<br>He was a scout and training in Thailand. While travelling on a truck at night, they stopped for a break. That night was real dark, no moon cannot even see hand in front of you. My friend was worried so he asked the driver can he see in front? The driver say "no". My friend suggested he switch on his headlights but driver not willing (I think not suppose to switch on light or else enemy will see?) Anyway, my friend promise to take responsibility for any action taken against the driver because it was his own idea, so the driver agreed. When the lights turned on, they were absolutely shocked! Right in front of the truck was a huge tree!! <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>in end of 99 my former active unit was undergoing a watercraft conversion course since the company will be ord soon. the course is conducted by the former OC.... a SOB, mother F***er, KNNCBB &amp; etc SAF local scholar then a CPT.......no one in the ccy or even in the bn likes him.... not even the CO..... we were undergoing a night mission ex between the water lanes of tekong and tekong kecil. it was a full moon.... so there was spring tide.....  the tide around there is very low indeed...... many of us told that idiot that at this tide, many of our watercrafts will be grounded even the senoir instructors (WOs) had warned him of this..... but being a SOB, mother F***er, KNNCBB &amp; etc SAF local scholar, he god damn think that he is always right and you lower rank personnel are always wrong...... and there we go.... the first few watercrafts were grounded......just like tua peh gong.......sitting there in the low tide.....what a sight indeed.... if the msians were looking, they will have a good laugh........<br><br>this is no the funniest part.... then came the climax.... the exercise is been watched by this CO, a COL.... this COL is usually a very nice guy,...... i never seen him lost his cool or temper before.... he was jumping mad...... he shouted at this CPT in front of his former coy... i was out at sea at least 200-300m away.... and i heard someone shouting..... at that time i wonder who got f***ed big time...... it was not until i landed on the beach that someone told me that SOB, mother F***er, KNNCBB &amp; etc SAF local scholar got a good one big time.....<br><br>it is sad to know that this SOB, mother F***er, KNNCBB &amp; etc SAF local scholar is some MAJ or even LTC screwing up someone..... i once told my CSM that in the even that war breaks up, i will shoot him first if he were to be my OC or CO....  I rather go for a court martial then to let him march the whole unit to their deaths.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hello everyone!!! Being loitering around this forum for some time liao and decided to share some incidents......<br><br>Not sure whether is this considered a cock up........<br><br>We were supposed to have FIBUA Lima Foxtrot and one of our PL SGT was tasked to be the store and ammo ic. He was this young SGT from SAFEC who was known for screws-up and his platoon hates him to his gut.<br><br>The whole company with the store tonner and ammo arrived at the FIBUA area waiting for the Lima Foxtrot to commence. Everything swee swee, ahead of schedule......... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"><br><br>After sorting out the stores, he discovers that he did not load the empty magazine into the store tonner. It was still in armskote. Then arrived the OC and discovered the cockup.<br><br>Right in full view of the company, the OC slapped the bugger and screwed him upside down...... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_eek.gif" alt="Shocked" title="Shocked">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_eek.gif" alt="Shocked" title="Shocked"><br><br>After the screwing session, he quickly jumps onto the tonner and drive back to our camp to get the magazines.......so the Lima Foxtrot was delayed for 1 hours.... The best thing is during the Lima Foxtrot, while issuing the ammo, he was till joking and laughing.... never took the whole cock-up seriously.....our CSM also commented that he never see our OC so pissed before and throughout his 20 odd years, he never encounter such cock-up before....<br><br>Last I heard the PL SGT passed his CSM course and our former OC is now a LTC in the US with the Apache attachment.......<br><br>FYI, I am from Armour. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>
