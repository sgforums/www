To further develop our partnership, EADS and A*STAR are<br>currently working on an overarching research collaboration framework agreement<br>which would allow future projects to be launched without lengthy legal<br>negotiations.Â”<br>Â“This is I2RÂ’s first collaboration with EADS and we are pleased with the successful<br>completion. It has proven, yet again, that our institute's crypto R&amp;D expertise can<br>be applied to meet industry needs,Â” said Prof Lye Kin Mun, Deputy Executive<br>Director (Industry) of I2R.<br>This joint project was led by Dr Bao Feng, Head of the Cryptography and Security<br>Department of I2R in partnership with experts from EADS. Major scientific results<br>from the joint project include:<br>Â• two innovative cryptographic block ciphers jointly designed and evaluated<br>by both parties, for the use in secure mobile communicators,<br>Â• an in-depth analysis of homomorphic crypto-systems suitable for<br>governmental electronic voting systems. From the analysis, I2R designs a<br>new cryptographic scheme with improved properties suitable for electronic<br>voting. A homomorphic cryptosystem allows operation to be carried on<br>2<br>encrypted text such as e-voting where the operation is to sum up ballots<br>without revealing the details of the ballots.<br>According to experts from EADS, the outcome of this Singaporean project has<br>been optimized for hardware implementation in cryptographic application-specific<br>integrated circuits (ASICs) to be used in EADSÂ’ world-leading product lines.<br>Notes to Editor:<br>EADS is a global leader in aerospace, defence and related services. In 2006, EADS<br>generated revenues of Â€ 39.4 billion and employs a workforce of about 116,000.<br>EADS Singapore Research &amp; Technology Centre is an extension of the Research<br>Organization within the EADS Group (Â“EADS Innovation WorksÂ”) driven by its Global<br>Industrial Development strategy. It manages projects for the EADS business units and<br>EADS Innovation Works while performing its activities in close cooperation with<br>Singaporean scientific institutions.<br>The Agency for Science, Technology and Research, or A*STAR, is Singapore's lead<br>agency for fostering world-class scientific research and talent for a vibrant knowledgebased<br>Singapore.<br>A*STAR actively nurtures public sector research and development in Biomedical<br>Sciences, Physical Sciences and Engineering, with a particular focus on fields essential<br>to Singapore's manufacturing industry and new growth industries. It oversees 14<br>research institutes and supports extramural research with the universities, hospital<br>research centres and other local and international partners. At the heart of this knowledge<br>intensive work is human capital. Top local and international scientific talent drive<br>knowledge creation at A*STAR research institutes. The Agency also sends scholars for<br>undergraduate, graduate and post-doctoral training in the best universities, a reflection of<br>the high priority A*STAR places on nurturing the next generation of scientific talent.<br>(www.a-star.edu.sg)<br>The Institute for Infocomm Research (IÂ²R - pronounced as i-squared-r) is a member of the<br>Agency for Science, Technology and Research (A*STAR) family. Established in 2002, our<br>mission is to be the globally preferred source of innovations in `Interactive Secured<br>Information, Content and Services Anytime AnywhereÂ’ through research by passionate<br>people dedicated to SingaporeÂ’s economic success. I2R performs R&amp;D in information,<br>communications and media (ICM) technologies to develop holistic solutions across the<br>ICM value chain. Our research capabilities are in information technology and science,<br>wireless and optical communications, and interactive digital media. We seek to be the<br>infocomm and media value creator that keeps Singapore ahead.
