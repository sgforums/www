              <p>damned you beat me to it.</p>
              <p>i 'd throw in fillipino and china nurses as well.</p>
              <p>our home front can accept foreign talent in medical sectors but cannot accept foreign talent in army ?</p>
              <p>@commander31,</p>
              <p>the brits failed for a mulitude of reasons,</p>
              <p>foremost for not seizing the initiative when they anticipated the japanese landings and stopping them at chokepoints in Malaya.</p>
              <p>competency in leadership : while percival was a brilliant staff officer who anticipated correctly where the japanese would land and how they would move down the malayan peninsular, he didnt dare to launch operation matador [his hands were tied actually, again, metaphorically speaking] , which would have repelled the japanese. He wasnt a battle tested warrior like yamashita.</p>
              <p>Percival's direct opposite, Yamashita, was fresh from Japan's war in china and was a seasoned field commander (unlike the green and unexperienced Percival). His rapid attack and use of unorthodox warfare like bicycles and tanks allowed rapid japanese advance.</p>
              <p>his bluff at the end of the battle of singapore (his troops were running out of arty shells and ammunition) managed to win the day. luck certainly was a factor. Had the British refused to surrender, there would probably be a likelihood of british forces repelling the intial wave of Japanese invasion and bunkering down in singapore.</p>
              <p>plenty of other reasons like if the prince of wales and repulse werent sunk and all that too. but ild summarize it with this. Britain had a game plan, its just that Britain didnt execute its game plan well enough and effectively enough to counter the Japanese.</p>

                  <p>I am not trying to argue we should have just questioning now
                  that we have a larger and heavier armour force how does SAF
                  going to support and maintain at the same performance.</p>
                  <p>Was also thinking the term forward defence..... and
                  rapid deployment goes hand in hand. If SAF is still taking that
                  approach i just think that
                  maintaining that capabilities goes hand in hand.
                   </p>
                  <p>Transport plane is an over support for all occasions. Together
                  for Peace n able to meet crisis needs. I don;t think
                  cirsis happen every year but it only need to happen once.

                  I agree. SG has to manage a tight budget. Every piece of equipment (that could cost $b) will need very watertight justification.
                  
                  That's not to say SG would not benefit from a heavy air transport fleet. Just a question of whether its worth getting.
