Details are sketchy as to what exactly happened," he told reporters on arrival at the Sixth Brigade's air strip here Wednesday afternoon.<br><br>In the incident, four soldiers from the Army's Second Division based at the Sungai Ara Camp in Penang suffered minor injuries when they were hit by shrapnel from two grenades believed to have been hurled at the border post.<br><br>They are Sarjan Mat Nazir Ishak, 34, Lans Koperal Azmi Rashid, 31, both married and two privates, Yuzaini Yusof, 26, and Abdul Razak Abdul Wahab, 23, both of whom are single.<br><br>The soldiers were carrying out routine patrols at the border post when the incident occurred, Mohamad Ismail said, adding that the operation was not done jointly with the Thai army but both parties coordinated their movements by informing each other of their respective positions.<br><br>"We have not determined yet the type of grenades used but they were certainly not ours. We will know the type of grenades that were used once we identify their splinter code," he said.<br><br>Mohamad Ismail said that an investigation was underway to determine the cause of the incident although it would be quite difficult to identify the attackers.<br><br>He said that the Thai army was giving its cooperation in the investigation and should the situation worsen, the Malaysian and Thai Armed Forces would hold talks.<br><br>"Let us not make any speculation on the incident," he said while assuring that the situation was under control.<br><br>He denied Thai media reports which stated that the Thai army helped send the injured soldiers to the Thaanto Hospital in Yala.<br><br>He said that Thai army medical personnel attended to the soldiers before they were airlifted by a Malaysian Army Nuri helicopter to the Brigade's hospital in Sungai Petani.<br><br>Also present were Army Field Commander Lt Jen Datuk Soheimi Abbas and the Second Division's Commander, Mej Jen Datuk Raja Apandi Raja Mohd Noor.<br><br>-- BERNAMA </blockquote><a href="http://www.bernama.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.bernama.com/</a></div>
