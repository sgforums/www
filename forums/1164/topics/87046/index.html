Maybe a bit bland or CMI, but they give you enough vitamin C every day. Come on, how many of you eat a whole orange everytime you eat orange? Not to mention the night snacks. I think the bread prepared by SFI not bad.<br><br><strong>if they can afford to give regulars so much more above the norm market, y not jus really take a look at NSFs, at the standards of living now, 350 is definitely not enuff, </strong><br><br>Hey hey, people sell their life to SAF leh ... so noble of them .. of course they deserve the $$$ .. haha<br><br><strong>my friend posted to TUAS naval base, he stay in tampinese, leaving the travelling time alone, the 350 givent to him may most likely have 50% given to public transport.</strong><br><br>He stay out personnel ah? Then too bad lor, if you stay in, transport fee won't be that high.<br><br><strong>My previous job, i have my blanglas on my instruction, they are paid 18 dollars daily, the thais are paid 22 dollars, and they have OT pay</strong><br><br>Hey hey, blanglas don't have such well-balanced meal I think. And they're exposed more to the hot sun than recruits. And do they sleep on king koil?<br><br>You do a suvey lor. If NS is do blanglas work, how many are willing to switch? In return for their pay.<br><br><strong>i know its not a pay, but having a allowance where 50percent of it will be on ur transport is not getting anywhere, and not all people have rich parents to dpend on, my BMT mate, gives everything to his parents, his total pay to his parents, cos his family really need it, of cos its absurd to ask for 1k-2k, but maybe it be something comparable to a factory worker? </strong><br><br>I think your friend can sort it out with SAF with regards to financial assistance. You can't expect them to give factory worker salary to every recruit. Unless the recruit signs on, this isn't really fair to MINDEF.<br><br><strong>if one day theres need to, i will still pickup my AR15 to fight, but am i fighting for myself, or for my country?</strong><br><br>You what generation one? Now people use SAR-21 liao lah, at least M16S1.</div>
