Some competitions have time factor in, so very fast shooting, not the classic type you expect.<br><br>In fact all shooting classes teaches double action for pistols, revolvers and rifles including SAF, Police and shooting clubs. Trainees are usually make to practise double action, which they pull and hold than follow through, this is to get them into the habit and feel. This is to train them so that, in actual shooting, well trained shooters are actually doing double-action while they aiming, all this they are doing unconsciously, and so fast that the by-stander see it as a single squeeze  which you call "squeeze through".<br><br>In close quarter combat situation, a swat team member with a pistol will not just squeeze it off, and hope for the best that he hit the target instead of hostage. He is trained till he can do the double action super fast and hit target precisely.</div>

P22x once came into the picture sometime back but the idea was replaced by a 'better' pistol...which we have no say, as usual.Â¡Â±<br><br>Double action is not for competition only. Some competitions have time factor in, so very fast shooting, not the classic type you expect.<br><br>In fact all shooting classes teaches double action for pistols, revolvers and rifles including SAF, Police and shooting clubs. Trainees are usually make to practise double action, which they pull and hold than follow through, this is to get them into the habit and feel. This is to train them so that, in actual shooting, well trained shooters are actually doing double-action while they aiming, all this they are doing unconsciously, and so fast that the by-stander see it as a single squeeze  which you call "squeeze through".<br><br>In close quarter combat situation, a swat team member with a pistol will not just squeeze it off, and hope for the best that he hit the target instead of hostage.
