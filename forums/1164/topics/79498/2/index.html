I had the chance to shoot a few models of glocks, can say they are totally great. In fact they will be more suitable for our army (in the case of limited pistols training for most officers).<br><br>1) When you have not so well-train folk, the problem come during action, it is a time which is life and death. Usually there is a lot of cases of no-well trained people pulling the pistol out and pull the trigger just to realise they forgot to release the safety and then panic trying to release it. This shock and delay can result in disaster. That is why glock design the safety into the trigger system.<br><br>2) The light weight work to the advantage. It is lighter, which make it more easy to carry, aim and shoot. Make a lot of different for a less well train shooter to aim and shoot.<br><br>3) The glock build their pistols so that the parts can be interchange with the same type of glock. That mean if you have 6 x glock 17, you can stripe them and mixed up the parts and reassemble them, they still all can work, which others cannot.<br><br>If someone play play and shoot themselves, then some unit is lucky enough to get rid of some idoit officer. If he/she cannot even trust to hand a load gun, he/she should not lead. First rule, never put your finger on the tigger till you ready to fire.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>still think the P226 would alwast be one of the best, heard it actually beat the M-9 in everything but price, anyway, speaking of M-9, anyone here tried a M-9 before?</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Yeah,tried M9 in US last year.Its popular coz alot of Ang Mos use it in their movies.And frankly,its a complicated piece more suited for police work compared to military purpose.Reason being that,there is a de-cocker lever.Once you cocked the weapon,you have to de-cock it.And in law-enforcement,if the bugger who snatch ur gun dunnoe there is a de-cocker,he cannot fire it.However the Glock right is more idiot-proof.In combat,most of the time you do have time to even think of what to do.Glock makes things simple,slot the mag into the gun,rack the slide back to chamber a round and den you are ready to go.H&amp;K P7 also not bad,coz safety is in the pistol grip.Tried that too,but you must get used to shooting while squeezing the safety or else,you will find it weird.<br><br>Lastly,Glocks is lighter then many of the other pistols on the market.And it can be stored in the cold,run over,buried in mud and still shoot straight once it is loaded with dry ammo.So what do you say?</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>snk86,<br><br>The fact is P226 is one of the best pistols in the world. The price is actually more expensive then glock.<br><br>But for Singapore usage, we have to consider other factors, remember they are build for western size, we are asian, we have to consider the effect of size of the grep, weight and ease of use. The p226 may be the better pistols, I have shot with it, and found its size is a little too big, which both hand have problem grepping it fully, this thus reduce the accuracy of aim. Something smaller will be better in our case<br><br></div>
