            <div class='col-md body'>The SAF is unlikely to issue / deploy P90 to signallers or sidearms for most of its men for a very simple reason:<br><br>It's called Logistics.<br><br>Lessons from WW2 and previous wars WWI, pre-WWI skirmishes have shown a need for common ammo / reduced variations.  The US army had to juggle with rounds for M1, SMG, BAR, Carbines, MG, and sidearms.<br><br>The resulting lessons from WW2 was to standardise ammo, hence the search for a silver bullet.  The 7.62 was initially selected but was too powerful and heavy.  This finally led to the US bulldozing everyone else to use its 5.56mm.<br><br>As it was not adequate for heavy MG fire, the 7.62mm continued to be used.  To reduce logistics requirements for squad level and yet have adequate firepower, the squad auto weapon was developed, a role initially filled by M60 MG (7.62mm) during the Vietnam era.  The US tried a heavy barrel M-16 as a SAW to replace the heavy M60 but was unsatisfactory.  This led to the development of the current SAW M249 (5.56mm) after the war.<br><br>For SG, we used to use the M-16 HB, before replacing it with the SAW / Ultimax-100.<br><br>Having a P90 / sidearms means additional logistics requirements from the current 5.56mm (section) and 7.62mm ammo (platoon).  Imagine your S4 sending you P90 rounds when you are carrying SAR-21.<br><br>Or you ran out of P90 rounds but have excess of 5.56mm....<br></div>

When it rain, even armed with any sniper rifle, unless you do cater for adjustment of the drag and wind of the wind, also depend on the effect on the ammo also. Possible the L96 will perform better as its barrel is design even to operate in artic environment, but cannot say that the SSG fail terrible due to insufficient training cater to shoot the SSG in the rain.<br></div>
