            <div class='col-md body'>especially for those thigh-ride holsters, when drawing the arm, its pointing inwards, so if the round is discharged, either ganna thigh or knee. some holsters like the Safariland ones the thumbbreak will 'lock' the hammer so even if u can manage to squeeze the trigger while still holstered, the hammer will not engage, further more u need to press the 'n' down before u can 'unlock'. so the finger should be always sliding outside the holster for easy taking out and keeping, safety reason also.<br><br>morale of the story, use Safariland and not Fobus holsters.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_twisted.gif" alt="Twisted Evil" title="Twisted Evil"></div>

If you are found carrying it outside your home, you better have a good reason for it, for they will invite you for a long talk at the police station, as you are breaking the law.<br><br>As for SAF allow personal knifes ? That all depend on your unit and your need, but that is limited to in camp or out in field exercise, Don't expect to bookout in uniform with a knife as a decoration, you end up in trouble. Even if the unit allow you, place it tactically, not too eye catching, remember it is there to use not as decoration, you never know if when you have higher ranking visitors who does not approve of non-standard issue items.<br><br>Forget about ordering knife from the internet, now the check is very strict, unless you done the nesserily paper work, don't even try to bring in by mail.</div>
