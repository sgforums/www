You have the bulk on shoulder, 2 hands on rifle, so 3 point contact, the weight is well distributed and center of gravity is ok. The recoil is assorbed mainly by the shoulder.<br><br>Now come the shoot of pistols. We have what we call 2 point contact.  You have 2 hands on the pistol. the center of gravity is in fact pulling you forward. The pistol fully loaded with 12 to 13 rounds is close to 1 kg. Holding it steady, is not as easy as it seem.  Even is the pistol is zero, forsight and hindsight which is nearer to each other, so much margin for error, a slight alightment error will end up the bullet flying way out. The recoil is much stronger, as it don't have a butt like a rifle which help absorb the recoil,  recoil is totally  assorb by your hands. A rifle which is have 3 point contact ( tripod ) super firm. A pistol is 2 point contact ( bipod) not as good.<br></div>
