            <div class='col-md body'>Will the SAF issue sidearms during combat?<br><br>"No", at least not to the majority of ground troops.<br><br>I have served in a variety of infantry roles from Brigade S2 Int NCO, Battalion S2 Int NCO and also as infantry platoon NCO.<br><br>Even my Brigade commander, a Lieutenant-Colonel, uses the standard M16S1 during excercise. No pistol.<br><br>Very simple reason. Enemy sniper.<br><br>The sniper will shoot officers first and anyone with a sidearm will be picked out as an officer. Therefore SAF doctrine is all officers in the field shall be dressed and armed like the men.<br><br>Secondly, who says Singapore issues the P226 to SAF? The only fellow I met armed with a pistol during excercise was an arty Forward Observer - a Sikh lieutenant - who came to Brigade field HQ for briefing. He was armed with a SAF-issue Beretta M9 and a kukri (non-SAF issue, of course).<br><br>And this officer was extremely uncomfortable about carrying a pistol and had his weapon securely fastened to his holster and belt with a shoelace. He said a pistol is very easy to lose during excercise like a bayonet.<br><br>Even the sniper sergeant who came for briefing had only his Steyr sniper rifle and no sidearm.<br><br>Furthermore, a sidearm is virtually useless in battle and takes too much time to train someone to use one properly. Pilots aren't supposed to engage enemy on foot and his sidearm is only to defend himself at when his life is in danger. So the pilot won't be spending a lot of time at the range to perfect his pistol shooting skill unless on his own time because of personal interest.<br><br>I have friends in commando and they definitely don't have pistol training.<br><br>Another one mentioned that Signallers are going to be armed with the FN P90.<br><br>This is again questionable.<br><br>Why will the SAF issue an expensive, complicated and delicate weapon that fires imported ammo like the FN P90 to signallers?<br><br>We have a big stock of CAR-16 (scouts use them) and short SAR-21 can be procured cheaply locally.<br><br>So a recruit at BMT trains on the M16 or SAR21 and then relearns how to use the FN P90 when he becomes a signaller?<br><br>C'mon...<br><br>SAF ONLY issues FN P90 to SOF or maybe certain commandos for "hush puppy" role. This means to silence sentries before they can raise the alarm.<br><br>And only one or two will be issued to each team. The rest of the SOF team will still be armed with 5.56mm weapons like the short-barrel SAR21.<br><br>Why? Because the short SAR21 is more powerful than the FN P90. The P90 ammo is more powerful than the pistol-type SMG ammo like those used by MP-5 etc but is less powerful than the 5.56 on normal rifles.<br><br>This less powerful FN P90 ammo (5.7mm) makes it ideal for silencer weapons.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>TV dog,<br><br>"Secondly, who says Singapore issues the P226 to SAF?"<br>I say so !!! I was issue with P226, just because you - mountain tortise never see a P226 issue to anyone, does not mean it is not issue to someone.<br><br>"Why will the SAF issue an expensive, complicated and delicate weapon that fires imported ammo like the FN P90 to signallers?"<br>P90 is a very good weapon in its design, that is why expensive. It in fact it have better hitting power at certain range which more suit signallers and the design is that it does not to entangle with things, which make it very suitable for signallers.</div>
