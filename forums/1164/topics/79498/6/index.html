If a person who is new to a particular firearm..and uses it for the first time..all you have to do is..align the front sight and rear sight..align aiming eye i don't see why the bullet won't hit where you aim. (Assuming the gun is properly maintained.) I have only experienced shooting a .22 during NPCC (crap huh?) the only time i missed is when my hands are trembling..</div></blockquote>Jazzswing, think you got the wrong perception from your NPCC experience. If so easy people like Specop87 will not be joining shooting clubs. Sorry to be frank, NPCC .22 shoot is just desgin to make you feel good, and let you think that you can shoot ! If they don't give you so large human size target, standing so close to make sure some of you hit something, where the fun of joining NPCC ?<br><br>Standing close-range firing at that large target, aiming at heart, instead got chest, head, hand, and side as long as in the big box, all over the place, you still call on target in NPCC. But you cannot say it asÂ¡Â°don't see why the bullet won't hit where you aimÂ¡Â±. Unless at 18m, you aim at the heart and every rounds get the heart all grouped together than you can make that statement.<br><br>The .22 is a very small caliber. so very little recoil and easy to shoot, unlike 9mm.<br><br>Never assume that professional soldier can just pick up any rifle, pistol and align the front and rear sight, aim and bullet will hit where they aim, only movies it happens. You are lucky that .22 sight alignment happen to suit your eye. Others people eyes may not suit that sight alignment, they may miss totally, not that they are not good shooter, just zeroing is need, or they must know their shoot well enough and adjust their shots accordingly but they will still need to waste a shot or 2 to do that.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Regardless what firearm,it must be zeroed to the shooter's eyesight.And then it will be accurate.And to be frank .22 cal rounds are quite small,so recoil not that big.But compare it to something that is 9mm is diferrent.Anyway,just to add alittle more stuff to this thread.If,I say again a big IF,one day SAF decides to issue a side-arm to all troops regardless of service,what caliber in your own opinion do you think it should be,and why.<br><br>So far,for military handguns,mosr are using 9mm,.45 or .40.Feel free to express your points of views.</div>

I know, alway help to draw out the revolvers and ammos, escort them to the ranges. All of them sights are out to left or right a little. Everyone is too eager to start the moment it arrive, as teacher don't know about zeroing issues, range officer expect shooters to know how to adjust shooting instead but gauging 1st shoot.<br><br>About zeroing. Everyone of us is not perfect, all have some cockeye, left or right and up or down by some degree. So even center the front sight and back sight is not going to suit us. So what we do is to shoot and see if you cockeye to left or right and up or down, by how much. Then we can adjust the back sight left or right to compensate for your left or right cockeye and adjust the front sight up or down to compensate for your up or down cockeye. This adjustment process is call zeroing, sort of makeing the gun sights suitable for the shooter. Hope that help to explain zeroing.</div>

I know, alway help to draw out the revolvers and ammos, escort them to the ranges. All of them sights are out to left or right a little. Everyone is too eager to start the moment it arrive, as teacher don't know about zeroing issues, range officer expect shooters to know how to adjust shooting instead but gauging 1st shoot.<br><br>About zeroing. Everyone of us is not perfect, all have some cockeye, left or right and up or down by some degree. So even center the front sight and back sight is not going to suit us. So what we do is to shoot and see if you cockeye to left or right and up or down, by how much. Then we can adjust the back sight left or right to compensate for your left or right cockeye and adjust the front sight up or down to compensate for your up or down cockeye. This adjustment process is call zeroing, sort of makeing the gun sights suitable for the shooter. Hope that help to explain zeroing.</div></blockquote>such errors contribute to little off-aim. unlikely will cause the shot to miss the target but if shooting bowlingpin then most likely is totally miss liao loh....0 marks...heh</div>

But in NPCC ranges or competitions, the Range Officer is a police shooting instructor, he be too busy ensuring safety of folks and security for the revolvers and ammo first. The rest are teachers or a few cadet inspectors, all just know the basic shooting training only, not much better than you all, so very hard to be fair without more help.<br><br>No I am not with the police, long ago trophies all lost out, police commissioner, humilitate by everyone, so die die must bring back all trophy, if not police shooting instructors can retired early. I was a cadet inspector with NPCC then, who is good for nothing but shooting. So got drag into special intensive shooting training and  after got selected into that competition team. After that every weekend at ranges to shoot to maintain shoot skill and also help out.<br><br>I was suppose to transfer to police after BMT with bright path all taken care of. Sigh ! got sabo by my BMT PC and Sgt ! end up in OCS, which rejected my request to posting to police !  Then luck got worst, got sabo till end up in Combat Engineer !</div>

Also they bring me around to gun shops and ranges to try out a lot of others.<br><br>The rest i got to shoot is more of colt 1911, glock series,  Beretta 92B, HK series, smith &amp; wesson series, the rest are scope rifles.<br><br>In fact I found out how crazy the gun rules is over there ! I am told by all gun shops, as long as I am over at america more then 3 days, no criminal records, I can buy and own a pistol or gun ! A glock or sig cost about somewhere from USD$500-700 + The cheapest pistol is about USD$150 !!! totally crazy ! Don't feel too safe there after knowing that it is so cheap and easy to buy a pistol.<br><br>One of my colleague is already asking me to go over during the next hunting season, to go hunting with them ! Crazy ideal, think I will pass for some crazy guy may use me as a target instead.</div>

Even explosion scenes is also with fire effect which is totally not true. All for look better for the camera, not real life.<br><br>Well nowaday most pistol or rifles are design to minizes muzzle flash. You don't usually see notice muzzel flash during day but night time, possible. Usually you see flash, smoke or carbon, that mean that rifle is not clean or oily inside.</div>
