But if i see a combat medic I have a clear shot on, I'll shoot him anyway. Coz every person he saves is gonna kill one or more of my own in the future. This way, when we shoot em dead, they stay dead.<br><br>Yes combat medics have an already heavy load, but it's necessary to carry the standard rifle to defend themselves. If they carry a side arm, what if someone shoots the medic from a distance? How is the medic to engage back with a sidearm like a pistol?<br><br>The enemy can shoot anyone from a certain distance depending on their weapons system. If a medic cannot defend himself properly then gets killed because he carries only a damn sidearm, why bring him along in the first place? Is the platoon supposed to protect the medic? No, the job of the platoon is to complete their mission. The medic is there to care for the wounded in the platoon/coy/bn.<br><br>It's gonna sound bad, but no one in the front of the battle gives a damn about the medic (maybe the PS, CSM, RSM only) until they're a casualty. Do you think they have the time to care about what's behind them? Medics are left to fend for themselves and the only way they can do that is to carry whatever weapon everyone else is carrying.<br><br><blockquote><strong>Anyway,P226 is an old gun.SAF should consider the Glock 17 or 19.Perhaps even the Fn Five-SeveN which is of same calibre as the P90.<br><br>Lastly,I think best if all troopers get to handle a sidearm,coz if ur main weapon malfunction in firefight,u at least got sumthing to work with.Instead of standing there or running for cover holding a piece of plastic and metal which can only be used as a club.</strong></blockquote>Also IMO, I'll rather carry more ammo for my rifle, then to carry a separate small side arm and it's separate ammo. I don't really see the point of carrying 2 different weapons and it's separate ammo. How are you going to keep them? Maintence in the field would also be a problem.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>SpecOps87<br>Â¡Â°Hi all, just wondering if the SAF issue the front-line combat troops with a side-arm besides the standard issue M16S1/AR-15/SAR-21/M203/Ultimax 100 or GPMG? And also, what side-arm is it?Â¡Â±<br><br>For officer, the rank of Company Commander and above, if wartime, they are suppose to be issue P226 pistol. It is still one of the finest pistols in the world. For peace time, P226 is use only during special parades.<br><br>Military Police of course use side-arms, would expect them to be P226.<br><br>SOF let their personals have a wide choice of different pistols.<br><br>The Bear<br>Â¡Â°why don't medics be issued sidearms instead of a bloody rifle... Â¡Â°<br><br>One old sgt in US army said to some soldiers on pistols - Â¡Â°The day you need your pistol is the day you wish you have a rifle instead.Â¡Â±<br><br>It is very difficult to shoot a pistol. It is totally unlike in arcade, in untrained hand, you will not hit anything even if it is just 15m away. Think of a P226 weight unloaded is already 742g (9mm), once fully loading, bring up to aim and shoot, that became a problem. Also pistol needs zeroing, that means personal pistol to user, and 100 rounds per year to ensure it is of use to the owner.<br><br>Try to imagine, with almost 1kg tried to one of your leg, and extra 9mm, I am sure you your movement is restricted and slowdown. Unless you are going into a narrow tunnel, think it is still better to have a good rifle that is well maintenance.<br><br>Tango1<br>As for the claims that US army issue their machine gunner with pistol, that is not true. If MG gunner is carry a machine gun with ammo, the weight is already too much, adding a pistol will only kill him 1st.  They are better off, carry more spare machine gun ammo.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>BMEngineer ,<br><br>NSF, officer will not have the chance. Unless you are in special roles.<br><br>Even the regular, think only a few years, they let you shoot the most 1 or 2 mag. The problem is, that is not call training. As there too little rounds to consider training or even zeroing, also those are not personal arms, so those P226 are not zero to indiviual.<br></div>
