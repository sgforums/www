ROC has always been an important, yet unspoken part of our foreign policy, with Israel. The reality of international relations today and the regional politics in Asia mean that we cannot openly embrace these two states.<br><br>However, we have to look at this relationship we have with them, on the basis that both ROC and Israel helped us in our most dire moments, and formed the basis of our armed forces, the very nature of our sovereignty.<br><br>LHL had this to say to the PRC, that <strong>Singapore has a right and will define her national interest in her own terms and no one will dictate to us</strong>. The mass media missed this point, and instead focused on the more negative aspect of how we didn't show the PRC any respect etc.</div>

To the PRC, it was a simple, "you don't give us face." They are quick to forget whatever good that we've done for them too.  That a lot of their scholars are receiving education at extremely reduced fees, the money we invest into Shenzhen and other projects.<br><br>Personally, if a war ever breaks out with ROC, I feel sure that the SG government would stand with US and the international community.  Whatever commitments to both ROC and PRC we have are off the moment war breaks out.  I'm sure SG will do its part to mediate the 2 Chinas when tensions escalate, but we'll definitely pull out with war.<br><br>Honestly, the chances of SAF troops in Taiwan getting involved in a firefight is slim.  An all out amphibious assault on Taiwan can't be hidden, and we'd be out of there before the fighting starts.<br><br>And seriously, no point for China to launch a missile barrage at Taiwanese camps if they don't intend to make a massive amphibious landing.</div>

Singapore was even the venue for the cross straits talk between the two chinas. It is only when Lee Teng Hui started the move to amend ROC constitution, and the final change of government, then the exchanges between Taiwan and Singapore became few and far in between. I believe LHL had felt that he needed to understand the mindset of the leaders in the new ah bian government. It was not a bad judgement.<br><br>I have no problem if Singapore were to stand alongside ROC, against a communist PRC, if PRC had acted unreasonably.<br><br>But if the Taiwan issue is used by the US against PRC, Singapore should never be part of it.<br><br>If the new Taiwanese government began to dissociate Taiwan from China, as being done now, then the ah bian government is bringing his head to crash against PRC.

            <div class='col-md body'>Back to the OP: Has anyone read some of the scenarios of a Chinese attack on Taiwan? One plausible way is for the Chinese to focus on rapid assymetric warfare knowing the US has a weakness in rapid deployment for a large scale land war. It seems that that the first wave may involve missile strikes and cyber attacks on Taiwan's C4ISR to cut communication between commanders and the their units, coupled with airborne assaults on vital military and civilian infrastructure targets, including neutralising the top political and civilian people in Taiwan.<br>This first wave may be hard to detect (disguised as an exercise) or the Chinese can destroy US and Taiwanese spy satellites as they recently demonstrated that capability. It is a decapitation concept - cut off the head and the rest of the body is in confusion/paralysed. If executed very quickly by the Chinese, there may be no more organised resistance even before the Americans arrive, so the Ameircan mission changes from supporting Taiwan to "invading" Chinese-occupied Taiwan, which is a different ball game and may not have political support.<br>I'm not saying the Taiwanese soldiers are weak and give up easily, but from hearing comments from our soldiers who have exercised with them, they appear to lack initiative at the platoon to company level (compared to our soldiers). So if their command and control is destroyed, it could be a premature end without much fighting.<br>It appears that the Taiwanese shouldn't just beef up their conventional hardware like buying Apaches, destroyers and subs but also look into better protection of their C4ISR and guarding their leadership and maybe train their soldiers to operate more independently.<br>Some interesting reads:<br>http://www.globalfirepower.com/chinese_report.asp<br>http://www.c4isrjournal.com/story.php?F=2366056</div>
