            <div class='col-md body'>Taiwan Plans To Buy US-Made Attack Choppers<br><br>by Staff Writers<br>Taipei (AFP) April 11, 2007<br>Taiwan plans to purchase 30 advanced Apache attack helicopters from the United States in the face of a mounting military threat from rival China, a defence official said Wednesday. The deal would require the approval of the United States, the island's leading arms supplier despite a lack of diplomatic relations between the two countries.<br>Beijing strongly objects to any arms sales from Washington to Taiwan, which it regards as part of its territory awaiting reunification, by force if necessary.<br><br>"The attack helicopter deal has been under evaluation," defence ministry spokesman Major-general Wu Chi-fang told AFP, declining to provide details on the sensitive issue.<br><br>The Taipei-based China Times reported Wednesday that defence minister Lee Jye had approved two arms packages for an estimated 230 billion Taiwan dollars (6.95 billion US).<br><br>This includes 92.4 billion dollars for 30 Boeing attack helicopters, along with the 140 billion-dollar acquisition of 90 transport helicopters to replace the army's ageing UH-1H fleet, one of which crashed into a radio tower last week, killing all eight army officers on board.<br><br>The defence ministry immediately ordered the grounding of all remaining choppers of the same model for safety checks.<br><br>However, Wu said the reported proposal for transport helicopters was still on the drawing board.<br><br>Major General Huang Yi-li from the defence ministry told reporters Tuesday that the UH-1H fleet would be gradually retired in 10 years beginning 2008.<br><br>Taiwan has been seeking more advanced weaponry amid Beijing's repeated threats to invade.<br><br>In a wide-ranging interview with CNN in January, Taiwan's President Chen Shui-bian accused China of provoking the island by targeting it with nearly 1,000 missiles.<br><br>Tensions between Taiwan and China have escalated since the independence-leaning leader was elected president in 2000. He was narrowly re-elected in 2004.<br><br><a href="http://www.sinodaily.com/reports/Taiwan_Plans_To_Buy_US_Made_Attack_Choppers_999.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.sinodaily.com/reports/Taiwan_Plans_To_Buy_US_Made_Attack_Choppers_999.html</a></div>

Assessed by military experts from other forums:<br><br>1) Currently, China does not have enough water transport capability to support an amphibious assualt<br><br>2) China does not have at the moment, enough logisitics to support a land assualt on Taiwan.<br><br>3) Taiwan has enough capability to hold beyond the time it takes for US carrier to arrive.<br><br>4) Despite the number of missiles aimed at Taiwan, that itself will not cause Taiwan to surrender.
