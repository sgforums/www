            <div class='col-md body'>But he does make a valid point.When you want to compare BMTC, SISPEC, and OCS, you will eventually come to a point where you have to compare the end-product of these places in order to weigh up their merits and demerits.he mentioned the experiences he faced under different kinds of commanders, be it WOs or officers.It is true that there are CPTs who serve barely any time yet their rank determines they have to be Coy 2IC, OC or SO2, SO1.The latter two are not so much a concern since they are staff appts which do not have a very direct influence on the men in a generic rifle coy or any combat coy.For the former three appts, I would rather have an experienced MWO or 1WO (grade2) to lead the men, provided he has gone for instructional and educational advancement courses.Reason being that the main job scope there is combat and soldier managment, and you need the years of experience and ability to see the nuances in the men's behavior to anticipate any problems and move them as a whole force.They have simply more experience at the ground, as opposed to some junior officers who have not managed people before and are thrown into a situation where he is the end-all for the battalion.He does not benefit, neither do the men.<br><br>To be given CPT rank, he should have gone through his PC tour, or else he should be shifted to staff roles first.SISPEC and OCS do teach different things, and the ROA to the top is certainly a very different  route.But what the previous guy said, does make for pondering.Scholars are not blooded well enough, and they are not military affairs, history or tactics SMEs.Rather, they are groomed for staff roles and they should not be placed in a situation where their training is not relevant to their job.The screw-ups have come too soon too often.We cannot afford it.</div>
