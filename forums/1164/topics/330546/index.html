              <p>There are 2000 armed Gurkhas in Singapore and their number grows annually by 140.</p>
              <p>This is a dangerous sign.</p>
              <p>Gurkhas are not Singaporeans. They are mercenaries. AND Mercenaries work for money.</p>
              <p>In other words, Gurkhas can be bought with money. Loyalty is a
              tricky issue here, for their loyalty is dependent on their having to be
              satisfied with material reward. AND NOW this has proven to be true with
              their recent rioting incident in Mount Vernon Camp over pay issues
              which is very worrying.</p>
              <p>I do not know how the trouble makers will be taken to task in this
              incident and whether or not there will be a coverup because of the way
              in which the MHA has conducted itself with the lack of transparency in
              the way it fumbled over the Mas Selamat Kastari escape.</p>
              <p>The latest Gurkha rioting incident raises many questions in the
              minds of Singapore Citizens as to: How this mercenary unit being
              brought in and being armed? How is this mercenary unit empowered to act
              in Singapore? How is this mercenary unit subject to law and discipline
              and control?</p>
              <p>Will the rioters be charged and disciplined accordingly? What sort of discipline will they receive?</p>
              <p>As seen from the Mas Selamat Kastari escape, our administration will
              bend over backwards for these foreign mercenaries. The Gurkhas on duty
              ought to have been charged under the Penal Code but instead they were
              let off with a slap on their wrists. I believe the negligent
              Singaporean ISD officers received far heavier sanction compared to the
              negligent Gurkhas. It is amazing how much better treatment these
              foreigners are being treated in comparison to their Singaporean
              counterparts in the Police.</p>
              <p>[By the way when Singaporean boys have petty fight in groups, they
              are often charged with rioting and they go to jail for it, I wonder if
              our Singapore Police Force is held to any higher standards of conduct]</p>
              <p>We can trust that the Singapore Police Force and the Ministry of
              Home Affairs will do their best to cover up this incident and sweep it
              under the carpet. As if underneath the carpet is already not dirty
              enough. I would caution against condoning such coverup and I would also
              caution against the Singaporean public to be complacent enough to
              overlook the need to pressure the MHA into revealing the worms in the
              innards of the Gurkha Contingent.</p>
              <p>This is because it is my view that the continued presence of Gurkhas
              in Singapore is the greatest danger to Singapore itself. My reasons are
              stated below.</p>
              <p>If the PAP administration persists on being unrepentant on their
              mercenary ways and insist on using mercenaries for their security or
              should i say “the security of Singapore”, it would not be difficult to
              imagine the possibility of such attitudes infecting the Gurkha
              Contingent [which is mercenary in the first place] and resulting in the
              Gurkha Contingent selling out Singapore in time to come.</p>
              <p>Imagine, there are 2000 mercenaries armed and ready. Their
              allegiance unknown. It is easy for them to even try to eliminate the
              entire leadership and neutralize the other Singaporean units in the
              Singapore Police Force should they ever decide to do so. And it would
              be easy for them to do so because the PAP trusts the Gurkhas more than
              they trust Singaporean Police Officers, they get the Gurkhas to guard
              Ministers homes.</p>
              <p>Furthermore, the Gurkhas are professional soldiers and mercenaries,
              they are put constantly under training during their service. They upon
              completion of their vocational training continue to serve their careers
              in the position they have been trained for.</p>
              <p>Singaporean National Servicemen on the other hand are under training
              only whilst doing their national service and they only turn operational
              near to their Run-Out-Date (Operationally ready date) only to be
              released and returned to their civilian status.</p>
              <p>In the Singapore Armed Forces, we all know that in each SAF camp,
              there are roughly only 10-12 rifles in each aggregated guard detail and
              maybe 200-300 rounds of ammunition in each guardhouse. Other than that,
              all other weapons and ammunition are stored separately and drawing of
              arms and ammunition in times of need will take time.</p>
              <p>As of now, we know nothing of the Gurkha Contingent’s weapons
              drawing protocol and ammunition storage and drawing protocol but there
              is reason to believe that their ammunition and weapons are stored in
              the same camp unlike the weapons and ammunition which are stored
              separately in all SAF units. Therefore, it is my belief that our SAF
              units cannot react fast enough to be mobilized, armed and ready for
              action if their was a mobilization call to neutralize the Gurkha
              Contingent when the need arises.</p>
              <p>The red tape from the rules set by our leaders surrounding SAF
              weapons and ammunition drawing and the inherent fact that our
              Singaporean National Servicemen stay in the far flung corners of
              Singapore [with compliments from the Central Posting Centre in Mindef]
              as opposed to the Gurkhas being accommodated in their camp whilst on
              duty and being accommodated near their camp whilst off duty will
              prevent our local units  from reacting fast enough to tackle the
              mercenary unit should the mercenaries turn renegade.</p>
              <p>[Please recall that in this incident, the SOC reacted fast enough to
              deploy  Mount Vernon Camp because it was an incident of scuffle and
              rioting. This situation would be vastly different from the scenario
              where the  entire Gurkha Contingent co-operate and mutiny, there would
              be no 999 call to the Radio Division Singapore Police Force, there
              would also be no advance warning call to the Special Operations
              Command.]</p>
              <p>The PAP had better come up with much better reasons for maintaining the need for the Gurkha Contingent.</p>
              <p>Should the Gurkha Contingent revolt for reasons unknown, the PAP’s
              policy of recruiting and arming foreigners heavily on its own soil may
              prove to be the worst ever decision the administration has made and
              might in actual fact lead to the downfall of Singapore.</p>
              <p>I repeat myself. Gurkhas are not Singaporeans, they are mercenaries
              and they intend to retire in their homeland when they finish their
              terms of services. Gurkhas are i believe more heavily armed, from what
              the photos reveal, with at least Heckler &amp; Koch MP5 submachine guns
              and M-16 assault rifles as opposed to most of their Singaporean
              counterparts with their Smith &amp; Wesson 0.38 revolvers. God knows
              whether or not they have the same heavy weapons as a SAF Infantry
              Battalion e.g. GPMGs.</p>
              <p>Thank God that Singapore still has its Special Operations Command,
              Police Task Force unit, KINS and PINS. This however does not square the
              equation because do we have as many as 2000 fighting men in the Special
              Operations Command? I believe not.</p>
              <p>The question is to MHA is this - What function does this unit perform which cannot be performed by true blue Singaporeans?</p>
              <p>I hereby declare my intention to campaign for the disarming and
              disbanding of the Gurkha Contingent and I hope other Singaporeans will
              rally with me with this call.</p>
              <p>Until the administration gets pressured enough to be accountable
              with how the Gurkhas’ recruitment, training, deployment and weapons
              access and cost of upkeep, I pray for all Singaporean police officers,
              especially those in the Special Operations Command, to keep a keen and
              watchful eye on the Gurkha Contingent for reasons which i need not say
              more.</p>
              <p>No one need to look too far into history to know the dangers of having a foreign armed mercenary unit in Singapore.</p>

              <p>The simple answer is that the racial riots of the past and the religious tensions of the present and forseeable future require that the Singapore Government have at hand an impartial and neutral party, not beholden to any local populace or ideology, and <strong>loyal to the Government</strong>, in order to maintain peace and order in times of civil conflict.</p>

              <p>hmm, not that i agree totally with the poster here on everything.</p>
              <p>but the link between gurkha and PAP is fascinating and not without basis. for instance. go wander around the area around singtel comcentre. if you walk somewhere in the right direction, you'd come across a home (private estate) thats guarded by SPF gurkhas.</p>
              <p>gurkhas are also frequently deployed in high profile VIP/escort duties. for instance, when a high level foreign diplomat or event is going on, you have gurkha's openly deployed at VIP complex changi airport and you can actually observe them in select locations.</p>
              <p>not outright or clear evidence of the link perhaps, but anecdotal evidence to suggest something else ?</p>
              <p>i think its really very interesting that the poster has raised such questions.</p>
              <p>i dont wish to comment about the organisation and deployment of gurkhas. i simply dont know enough.</p>
              <p>but i do find that the gurkhas actually have roles which tend to have areas of interet conflicts in terms of responsiblity and scope with other enforcement agencies. if so then, why the need or justification for this added force?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>@edwin3060:</p>
              <p>our gurkhas are pretty different from the british army gurkhas for several reasons</p>
              <p>1) ours are under police control</p>
              <p>2) ours can be considered operating under the para-military sphere of operations</p>
              <p>3) ours are underpaid by a huge yardstick compared to the british ones but much more than the Indian Gurkhas</p>
              <p>4) whereas british army/indian army gurkhas for that matter have a clear and distinct role in the military (elite/shock troops). our gurkhas are officially under SPF but do have assignments / can be branched out under ARMY command as well. complicated role/complex scope issues ?</p>

              <p>Personally, I agree with edwin3060, in that history has a lot to do with the Gurkhas' presence in Singapore. The fact is that the Gurkhas have proven to be useful in the past, and I believe that their presence is still useful especially after 911. One issue that the poster seems to ignore is a practical one. As I am sure everyone is aware, the SPF is desperately in need of more manpower. As the poster himself hints, even the SOC may not have the manpower to be as large as it needs to be. Having said that, how does the poster intend to fill the gaps that will inadvertantly appear if we remove the Gurkhas?</p>
              <p>Aside from worrying about the Gurkhas and the "threat" that they may pose, I think SPF has larger problems to solve. Namely, how to recruit and retain professional officers, and jack up its manpower so it can do its current job more effectively.</p>
              <p>In any case, nobody here can claim to fully know how the Gurkhas are managed, what happened at Mt Vernon, or what led to the disputes. My view is that we should not get ahead of ourselves.</p>

              singtel comcentre. if you walk somewhere in the right direction,
              you'd come across a home (private estate) thats guarded by SPF
              gurkhas.</p>
              <p>gurkhas are also frequently deployed in high profile VIP/escort
              duties. for instance, when a high level foreign diplomat or event
              is going on, you have gurkha's openly deployed at VIP complex
              changi airport and you can actually observe them in select
              locations.</p>
              <p>not outright or clear evidence of the link perhaps, but
              anecdotal evidence to suggest something else ?</p>
              <p>i think its really very interesting that the poster has raised
              such questions.</p>
              <p>i dont wish to comment about the organisation and deployment of
              gurkhas. i simply dont know enough.</p>
              <p>but i do find that the gurkhas actually have roles which tend to
              have areas of interet conflicts in terms of responsiblity and scope
              with other enforcement agencies. if so then, why the need or
              justification for this added force?</p>

              <p>our gurkhas are pretty different from the british army gurkhas
              for several reasons</p>
              <p>1) ours are under police control</p>
              <p>2) ours can be considered operating under the para-military
              sphere of operations</p>
              <p>3) ours are underpaid by a huge yardstick compared to the
              british ones but much more than the Indian Gurkhas</p>
              <p>4) whereas british army/indian army gurkhas for that matter have
              a clear and distinct role in the military (elite/shock troops). our
              gurkhas are officially under SPF but do have assignments / can be
              branched out under ARMY command as well. complicated role/complex
              scope issues ?</p>

              <p>As to your first point, guarding of VIPs, etc, these are national duties, and not tied to the PAP at all. If, for example, another party was to form the government, the Gurkhas would also have to be deployed to guard the PM, and other important ministers, in addition to the President. That was why I said that one of the roles of the Gurkhas is to guard the President and the <strong>Government</strong> of Singapore, as well as other VIPs, diplomats etc.</p>
              <p>Also, among the Special Ops communities, you will find that there are many common areas of training, and the reason for that is both backup and to ensure that all these highly trained people speak the same language-- in some areas of training both SOC and the SOF do the same thing, does that mean that they shouldn't have cross training? How sure are you that just one command will be enough in an emergency situation?</p>
              <p>Finally, like I said previously in other threads, while our Gurkhas are under the control of the SPF, the Gurkha detachment here was originally detached from the Gurkha Regiment in Britain, and Gurkha selection is still done by the British before the Gurkhas are sent to Singapore for both historical and practical reasons. So your whole contention about the Gurkhas being different are null and void.</p>

              <p>Close protection of VIPs falls within the duties of the security command officers whom are Singaporeans. Gurkhas just make up the sentries, u see them guarding other installations as well.</p>
              <p>There is a whole lot of difference between the duties of SOC and SOF. Unless you are talking about STAR within the SOC, i do not think the other units that form the main bulk of SOC shares facilities with SOF.</p>

              <p>if you read between the lines of what i wrote i think you'd get my meaning. Not every VIP in singapore has gurkha protection. go figure.certain individuals only and their households. and not simply just "high value" targets only. not everyone will have these gurkhas for protection. if you cant get this, i doubt you will. like i said, the best way of understanding this is to take a walk in the area between istana and singtel comcentre. you should see things that wont fit your explaination.</p>
              <p>regarding your special ops thing. i dont know where you get your sources from. but let me share with you what i have gleaned from anecdotal evidence and after speaking to a gurkha here during one assignment i had.</p>
              <p>the gurkhas in military uniforms are NOT special forces. they are under police command but have a special dual command structure where they can be transferred to military command in the event of special case situations. this only happened after the robbers landed in tekong in 2006. go figure. i wasnt even going near their role of "elite/special troops", that i know too little to comment. But from what i observed about their gear and their weapons, not as clear cut as you can imagine. its rather complicated. they are Much much more heavily armed and equipped compared to normal "SOC" troopers.</p>
              <p>and it contravenes the UN regulation on mercenaries if i m seeing it right.</p>
              <p>my point regarding them being under two commands. its unique. in Britain and India, the two countries with the largest contigents of gurkha's, they tend to be under a sole military structure.  Here their role is dual role.</p>
              <p>i never knew the british "selected" our gurkhas before coming here. the guy i spoke to sure didnt give me that impression. He even told me that back home in his village, everyone tries out for the british army first. highest pay, best benefits. even a chance to become citizens. Those who cannot make it then usually try to go for either the SPF or the indian army. Indian army is a popular choice because its nearer to home for them and they get a pension if the complete their service in the army,</p>
              <p>these are facts. perhaps you and i are seeing it from different points of view but that dosent mean its moot.</p>
              <p>dont wear blinkers over your eyes. nothing is static. things change.</p>
              <p>have you been to cuppage road area recently ? i used to head there for jamming at a place near tong le industrial building. maybe if you know where it is, then you can go observe and see the reason about why gurkha's are actually complaining about the pay.</p>
              <p>it might be anecdotal evidence but with a open mind and first hand insight, its all quite apparent to me.</p>
