This will be the 5th foreign satellite to be launched by ISRO.<br><br>The Antrix Corporation of the Department of Space and the Nanyang Technological University of Singapore have signed an agreement in this regard.<br><br>The satellite, a remote sensing 100 kg class micro X-SAT being developed by the Nanyang Technological University is for earth observation and imaging in visible spectral bands. The satellite will be used for land and coastal observations employing multi-spectral imaging. The three-axis stabilized spacecraft will have deployable solar panels. It will be launched by ISROÂ’s time-tested polar satellite launch vehicle PSLV during one of its forthcoming missions. The Antrix Corporation will also provide the Singapore University with the necessary support for testing the satellite.<br><br>The Corporation provides launching services for foreign satellites using ISROÂ’s PSLV. The other foreign satellites launched by ISRO earlier were Proba of Belgium, Bi9rd and DLR-TUBSAT of Germany and Kitsat-3 of Korea.<br><br>PSLV has been launching mainly Indian remote sensing satellites weighing upto 900 kg in polar orbit. Its modified version i.e. the PSLV C-4 for the first time put into orbit the Metsat an exclusive meteorological satellite weighing upto 1200 kg in September last. It was also the first time that the PSLV was used successfully for launching a satellite into the geostationary transfer orbit.<br><br></div>
