            <div class='col-md body'>F-15 Eagle<br><br>The F-15 Eagle is an all-weather, extremely maneuverable, tactical fighter designed to gain and maintain air superiority in aerial combat. The Eagle's air superiority is achieved through a mixture of maneuverability and acceleration, range, weapons and avionics. The F-15 has electronic systems and weaponry to detect, acquire, track and attack enemy aircraft while operating in friendly or enemy-controlled airspace. Its weapons and flight control systems are designed so one person can safely and effectively perform air-to-air combat. It can penetrate enemy defense and outperform and outfight current or projected enemy aircraft.<br><br>The F-15's superior maneuverability and acceleration are achieved through high engine thrust-to-weight ratio and low wing loading. Low wing-loading (the ratio of aircraft weight to its wing area) is a vital factor in maneuverability and, combined with the high thrust-to-weight ratio, enables the aircraft to turn tightly without losing airspeed.<br><br>A multimission avionics system sets the F-15 apart from other fighter aircraft. It includes a head-up display, advanced radar, inertial navigation system, flight instruments, UHF communications, tactical navigation system and instrument landing system. It also has an internally mounted, tactical electronic-warfare system, "identification friend or foe" system, electronic countermeasures set and a central digital computer.<br><br>Through an on-going multistage improvement program the F-15 is receiving extensive upgrade involving the installation or modification of new and existing avionics equipment to enhance the tactical capabilities of the F-15.<br><br>The head-up display projects on the windscreen all essential flight information gathered by the integrated avionics system. This display, visible in any light condition, provides the pilot information necessary to track and destroy an enemy aircraft without having to look down at cockpit instruments.<br><br>The F-15's versatile pulse-Doppler radar system can look up at high-flying targets and down at low-flying targets without being confused by ground clutter. It can detect and track aircraft and small high-speed targets at distances beyond visual range down to close range, and at altitudes down to tree-top level. The radar feeds target information into the central computer for effective weapons delivery. For close-in dog fights, the radar automatically acquires enemy aircraft, and this information is projected on the head-up display.<br><br>The APG-63 radar was developed over 20 years ago and has an average mean time between failure less than 15 hours. APG-63 LRUs have become increasingly difficult to support both in the field and at the depot. First, individual parts have become increasingly unavailable from any source; incorporating newer technology parts often entails module redesign and fails to address the root cause. Second, continuing reliability deterioration impacts both sustainment, particularly during deployment, as well as ACCÂ’s ability to implement two-level maintenance. In addition, the APG-63 radar has virtually no remaining processing and memory capacity to accommodate software upgrades to counter evolving threats. The APG-63(V)1 radar has been designed for improved reliability and maintainability to address user requirements. The radar incorporates components designed for improved reliability and lower failure rates and enhanced diagnostics for improved fault detection and fault isolation. Along with other design features, these should improve radar reliability to 120 hours MTBM, an order of magnitude better than the existing APG-63.<br><br>An inertial navigation system enables the Eagle to navigate anywhere in the world. It gives aircraft position at all times as well as pitch, roll, heading, acceleration and speed information.<br><br>The F-15's electronic warfare system provides both threat warning and automatic countermeasures against selected threats. The "identification friend or foe" system informs the pilot if an aircraft seen visually or on radar is friendly. It also informs U.S. or allied ground stations and other suitably equipped aircraft that the F-15 is a friendly aircraft.<br><br>The Fiber Optic Towed Decoy (FOTD) provides aircraft protection against modern radar-guided missiles to supplement traditional radar jamming equipment. The device is towed at varying distances behind the aircraft while transmitting a signal like that of a threat radar. The missile will detect and lock onto the decoy rather than on the aircraft. This is achieved by making the decoyÂ’s radiated signal stronger than that of the aircraft.<br><br>A variety of air-to-air weaponry can be carried by the F-15. An automated weapon system enables the pilot to perform aerial combat safely and effectively, using the head-up display and the avionics and weapons controls located on the engine throttles or control stick. When the pilot changes from one weapon system to another, visual guidance for the required weapon automatically appears on the head-up display.<br><br>The Eagle can be armed with combinations of four different air-to-air weapons: AIM-7F/M Sparrow missiles or AIM-120 Advanced Medium Range Air-to-Air Missiles on its lower fuselage corners, AIM-9L/M Sidewinder or AIM-120 missiles on two pylons under the wings, and an internal 20mm Gatling gun (with 940 rounds of ammunition) in the right wing root.<br><br>The current AIM-9 missile does not have the capabilities demonstrated by foreign technologies, giving the F-15 a distinct disadvantage during IR dogfight scenarios. AIM-9X integration will once again put the F-15 in the air superiority position in all arenas. The F-15/AIM-9X weapon system is to consist of F-15 carriage of the AIM-9X missile on a LAU-128 Air-to-Air (A/A) launcher from existing AIM-9 certified stations. The AIM-9X will be an upgrade to the AIM-9L/M, incorporating increased missile maneuverability and allowing a high off-boresight targeting capability.<br><br>Low-drag, conformal fuel tanks were especially developed for the F-15C and D models. Conformal fuel tanks can be attached to the sides of the engine air intake trunks under each wing and are designed to the same load factors and airspeed limits as the basic aircraft. Each conformal fuel tank contains about 114 cubic feet of usable space. These tanks reduce the need for in-flight refueling on global missions and increase time in the combat area. All external stations for munitions remain available with the tanks in use. AIM-7F/M Sparrow and AIM-120 missiles, moreover, can be attached to the corners of the conformal fuel tanks.<br><br>The F-15 Eagle began its life in the mid 1960s as the Fighter Experimental (FX) concept. Using lessons learned in Vietnam, the USAF sought to develop and procure a new, dedicated air superiority fighter. Such an aircraft was desperately needed, as no USAF aircraft design solely conceived as an air superiority fighter had become reality since the F-86 Sabre. The intervening twenty years saw a number of aircraft performing the air-to-air role as a small part of their overall mission, such as the primarily air-to-ground F-4 Phantom and the F-102, F-104 and F-106 interceptor designs. The result of the FX study was a requirement for a fighter design combining unparalleled maneuverability with state-of-the-art avionics and weaponry. An industry-wide competition ended on December 23, 1969 when McDonnell Douglas was awarded the contract for the F-15.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>*  The first  F-15A flight was made on 27 July 1972, culminating one of the most successful aircraft development and procurement programs in Air Force history. After an accident-free test and evaluation period, the first aircraft was delivered to the Air Force on Novermber 14, 1974. In January 1976, the first Eagle destined for a combat squadron was delivered to the 1st Tactical Fighter Wing at Langley Air Force Base, Va. Three hundred and sixty-five F-15As were built before production of the F-15C began in 1978. In January 1982, the 48th Fighter-Interceptor Squadron at Langley Air Force Base became the first Air Force air defense squadron to transition to the F-15. After twenty years of service, the F-15A has recently been reassigned from active duty Air Force fighter squadrons to Air National Guard units. The F-15A is flown by Air National Guard squadrons in the states of Oregon, Missouri, Georgia, Louisiana, Hawaii, and Massachussets.<br>* The first flight of the two-seat F-15B (formerly TF-15A) trainer was made in July 1973. The first F-15B Eagle was delivered in November 1974 to the 58th Tactical Training Wing, Luke Air Force Base, Ariz., where pilot training was accomplished in both F-15A and B aircraft. The F-15B incorporates a tandem seating configuration, with a second crewmember position aft of the pilot's seat. The primary purpose of the F-15B is aircrew training, with an instructor pilot occupying the rear seat while an upgrading pilot mans the front seat controls. The rear seat pilot has a full set of flight controls and can fly the aircraft throughout the envelope, including takeoff and landing. Even though space is sacrificed to accomodate the second crew member, the F-15B retains the same warfighting capability as the F-15A. In keeping with the trainer concept, however, the rear seat is not equipped with controls for the combat avionics and weaponry. In fact, the rear seat is not a mandatory crew position, and F-15Bs are often flown with empty rear cockpits.<br>* The F-15C is an improved version of the original F-15A single-seat air superiority fighter. Additions incorporated in the F-15C include upgrades to avionics as well as increased internal fuel capacity and a higher allowable gross takeoff weight. The single-seat F-15C and two-seat F-15D models entered the Air Force inventory beginning in 1979. Kadena Air Base, Japan, received the first F-15C in September 1979. These new models have Production Eagle Package (PEP 2000) improvements, including 2,000 pounds (900 kilograms) of additional internal fuel, provision for carrying exterior conformal fuel tanks and increased maximum takeoff weight of up to 68,000 pounds (30,600 kilograms). Externally, the differences between the F-15A and F-15C are so slight as to make identification difficult; the only reliable indicator is the aircraft serial number. All F-15As have tail numbers starting with 73- through 77-, while F-15Cs have tail numbers beginning with 78- through 86-. The F-15C is the Air Force's primary air superiority fighter, serving with active duty units at Langley AFB, VA, Eglin AFB, FL, Mountain Home AFB, ID, Elmendorf AFB, AK, Tyndall AFB, FL, Nellis AFB, NV, Spangdahlem AB, Germany, Lakenheath AB, England and Kadena AB, Okinawa. The operational F-15C force structure is approximately 300 aircraft assigned to operational units. In the mid-1990s the F-15C experienced declining reliability indicators, primarily from three subsystems: radar, engines, and secondary structures. A complete retrofit of all three subsystems could be done for less than $3 billion.<br>* The F-15D is a two-seat variant of the single-place F-15C. The primary purpose of the F-15D is aircrew training, with an instructor pilot occupying the rear seat while an upgrading pilot mans the front seat controls.<br><br>F-15C's, D's and E's were deployed to the Persian Gulf in 1991 in support of Operation Desert Storm where they proved their superior combat capability with a confirmed 26:0 kill ratio.<br><br>The F-15C has an air combat victory ratio of 95-0 making it one of the most effective air superiority aircraft ever developed. The US Air Force claims the F-15C is in several respects inferior to, or at best equal to, the MiG-29, Su-27, Su-35/37, Rafale, and EF-2000, which are variously superior in acceleration, maneuverability, engine thrust, rate of climb, avionics, firepower, radar signature, or range. Although the F-15C and Su-27P series are similar in many categories, the Su-27 can outperform the F-15C at both long and short ranges. In long-range encounters, with its superiorr radar the Su-27 can launch a missile before the F-15C does, so from a purely kinematic standpoint, the Russian fighters outperform the F-15C in the beyond-visual-range fight. The Su-35 phased array radar is superior to the APG-63 Doppler radar in both detection range and tracking capabilities. Additionally, the Su-35 propulsion system increases the aircraftÂ’s maneuverability with thrust vectoring nozzles. Simulations conducted by British Aerospace and the British Defense Research Agency compared the effectiveness of the F-15C, Rafale, EF-2000, and F-22 against the Russian Su-35 armed with active radar missiles similar to the AIM-120 Advanced Medium Range Air-to-Air Missile (AMRAAM). The Rafale achieved a 1:1 kill ratio (1 Su-35 destroyed for each Rafale lost). The EF-2000 kill ratio was 4.5:1 while the F-22 achieved a ratio of 10:1. In stark contrast was the F-15C, losing 1.3 Eagles for each Su-35 destroyed.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>F-15E Strike Eagle<br><br>Although the slogan of the F-15's original design team was "Not a pound for air-to-ground," the F-15 has long been recognized as having superior potential in the ground attack role. In 1987 this potential was realized in the form of the F-15E Strike Eagle. The mission of the Strike Eagle is as succinct as that of its air-to-air cousin: to put bombs on target. The F-15E is especially configured for the deep strike mission, venturing far behind enemy lines to attack high value targets with a variety of munitions. The Strike Eagle accomplishes this mission by expanding on the capabilities of the air superiority F-15, adding a rear seat WSO (Weapon Systems Operator) crewmember and incorporating an entirely new suite of air-to-ground avionics.<br><br>The F-15E is a two seat, two engine dual role fighter capable of speeds up to MACH 2.5. The F-15E performs day and night all weather air-to-air and air-to-ground missions including strategic strike, interdiction, OCA and DCA. Although primarily a deep interdiction platform, the F-15E can also perform CAS and Escort missions. Strike Eagles are equipped with LANTIRN, enhancing night PGM delivery capability. The F-15E outbord and inboard wing stations and the centerline can be load with various armament. The outboard wing hardpoint are unable to carry heavy loads and are assign for ECM pods. The other hardpoints can be employed for various loads but with the use of multiple ejection racks (MERs). Each MER can hold six Mk-82 bombs or "Snakeye" retarded bombs, or six Mk 20 "Rockeye" dispensers, four CBU-52B, CBU- 58B, or CBU-71B dispensers, a single Mk-84 (907 kg) bomb F- 15E can carry also "smart" weapons, CBU-10 laser quided bomb based on the Mk 84 bomb, CBU-12, CBU-15, or another, laser, electro-optical, or infra-red guided bomb (including AGM-G5 "Marerick" air-to-ground) missiles.<br><br>Conformal Fuel Tanks were introduced with the F-15C in order to extend the range of the aircraft. The CFTs are carried in pairs and fit closely to the side of the aircraft, with one CFT underneath each wing. By designing the CFT to minimize the effect on aircraft aerodynamics, much lower drag results than if a similar amount of fuel is carried in conventional external fuel tanks. This lower drag translate directly into longer aircraft ranges, a particularly desirable characteristic of a deep strike fighter like the F-15E. As with any system, the use of CFTs on F-15s involves some compromise. The weight and drag of the CFTs (even when empty) degrades aircraft performance when compared to external fuel tanks, which can be jettisoned when needed (CFTs are not jettisonable and can only be downloaded by maintenance crews). As a result, CFTs are typically used in situations where increased range offsets any performance drawbacks. In the case of the F-15E, CFTs allow air-to-ground munitions to be loaded on stations which would otherwise carry external fuel tanks. In general, CFT usage is the norm for F15Es and the exception for F-15C/D's.<br><br>The F-15E Strike EagleÂ’s tactical electronic warfare system [TEWS] is an integrated countermeasures system. Radar, radar jammer, warning receiver and chaff/flare dispenser all work together to detect, identify and counter threats posed by an enemy. For example, if the warning receiver detects a threat before the radar jammer, the warning receiver will inform the jammer of the threat. A Strike EagleÂ’s TEWS can jam radar systems operating in high frequencies, such as radar used by short-range surface-to-air missiles, antiaircraft artillery and airborne threats. Current improvements to TEWS will enhance the aircraftÂ’s ability to jam enemy radar systems. The addition of new hardware and software, known as Band 1.5, will round out the TEWS capability by jamming threats in mid-to-low frequencies, such as long-range radar systems. The equipment is expected to go into full production sometime in late 1999.<br><br>The Defense Department plans to sustain production of the F-15E for at least two more years, purchasing three aircraft in both FY 1998 and FY 1999. Without FY 1998 procurement, the F-15 production line would begin to close in the absence of new foreign sales. These six additional aircraft, together with the six aircraft approved by Congress in FY 1997, will sustain the present 132-plane combat force structure until about FY 2016. Under current plans by 2030, the last F-15C/D models will have been phased out of the inventory and replaced by the F-22.</div>

The first flight by a production A-10A Thunderbolt II (75-0025<img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"> was made 21 October 1975. Purchase of a total of 739 aircraft was planned (including the six DT and E aircraft); but funding was terminated in 1983 after a total of 713 production A-10s had been ordered. Delivery was completed 20 March 1984. There were still 327 aircraft in service with the USAF, USAF Reserve and ANG in early 1994. The Thunderbolt II was used during the Gulf War of 1991.<br><br>Export versions of the A-10 were available as single-seat night attack and two-seat combat-ready trainer aircraft. Night capability is provided by the addition of a Westinghouse WX-50 radar, Texas Instruments AAR-42 FLIR, Litton LN-39 inertial navigation system, Honeywell APN-194 radar altimeter, AiResearch digital air data computer, Ferranti 105 laser rangefinder and Kaiser head-up display. It is expected that night/adverse weather capability can be improved with the addition of a LANTIRN (low-altitude navigation targeting infrared for night) fire control pod. The first combat-ready A-10A wing was the 345th Tactical Fighter Wing, based at Myrtle Beach, South Carolina, to which deliveries began in March 1977.<br><br>DESIGN FEATURES:<br><br>Cantilever low-wing monoplane, with wide chord, deep aerofoil section (NACA 6716 on centre-section and at start of outer panel, NACA 6713 at tip) to provide low wing loading. Incidence -1 degrees. Dihedral 7 degrees on outer panels.<br><br>FLYING CONTROLS:<br><br>Wide span ailerons made up of dual upper and lower surfaces that separate to serve as airbrakes. Flaps, airbrakes and ailerons actuated hydraulically. Ailerons pilot-controlled by servo tab during manual reversion. Small leading-edge slat inboard of each mainwheel fairing. Redundant and armour-protected flight control system. Interchangeable elevators, each with an electrically operated trim tab. Rudders and elevators actuated hydraulically. Redundant and armour-protected flight control system.<br><br>STRUCTURE:<br><br>Aluminium alloy three-spar structure, consisting of one-piece constant-chord centre-section and tapered outer panels with integrally stiffened skins and drooped (cambered) wingtips. Outer panel leading-edges and core of trailing-edges are of honeycomb sandwich.<br><br>LANDING GEAR:<br><br>Menasco retractable tricycle type with single wheel on each unit. All units retract forward, and have provision for emergency gravity extension. Interchangeable mainwheel units retract into non-structural pod fairings attached to the lower surface of the wings.<br><br>POWER PLANT:<br><br>Two General Electric TF34-GE-100 high bypass ratio turbofan engines, each rated at 40.3 kN (9065 lb st), enclosed in separate pods, each pylon-mounted to the upper rear fuselage at a point approximately midway between the wing trailing-edges and the tailplane leading-edges. Fuel is contained in two tear-resistant and self-sealing cells in the fuselage, and two smaller, adjacent integral cells in the wing centre-section. Maximum internal fuel capacity 4853 kg (10,700 lb).<br><br>ACCOMMODATION:<br><br>Single-seat enclosed cockpit, well forward of wings, with large transparent bubble canopy to provide all-round vision. Bulletproof windscreen. Canopy is hinged at rear and opens upward. Douglas ejection seat operable at speeds of 450 knots (834 km/h; 518 mph) down to zero speed at zero height. Entire cockpit structure is protected by an armoured 'bathtub' structure of titanium, capable of withstanding projectiles up to 23 mm calibre.<br><br>ARMAMENT:<br><br>General Electric GAU-8/A Avenger 30 mm seven-barrel cannon, mounted in nose with 2 degrees depression and offset slightly to port so that as the barrels rotate the firing barrel is always on the aircraft's centreline. Gun and handling system for the linkless ammunitions are mechanically synchronised and driven by two motors fed from the aircraft's hydraulic system. The single drum magazine has a capacity of 1350 rounds, and has a dual firing rate of either 2100 or 4200 rds/min. Four stores pylons under each wing (one inboard and three outboard of each mainwheel fairing), and three under fuselage, for max external load of 7.257 kg (16,000 lb). External load with full internal fuel is 5482 kg (12,086 lb). The centreline pylon and the two flanking fuselage pylons cannot be occupied simultaneously. The centreline pylon has a capacity of 2268 kg (5000 lb); the two fuselage outer pylons and two centre-section underwing pylons 1587 kg (3500 lb) each; the two innermost outerwing pylons 1134 kg (2500 lb) each; and the four outermost wing pylons 453 kg (1000 lb) each. These allow carriage of a wide range of stores, including 28 226 kg (500 lb) Mk 82 LDGP general purpose bombs; eight BLU-1 or BLU-27/B Rockeye II cluster bombs, 16 CBU-52/71, 10 AGM-65A Maverick missiles; Mk 82 and Mk 84 laser-guided bombs; Mk 84 electro-optically guided bombs; two SUU-23 pods; chaff or other jammer pods; or up to three drop tanks.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>STOL-jet fighter of canarded delta configuration. The Viggen was designed to fulfill several roles with one basic airframe, but in multiple versions: fighter-bomber, attack aircraft, tactical recce, sea surveillance, operational trainer, and pure fighter. The canards and a thrust reverser --- the combination of this with an afterburner is unique --- make the Viggen capable of operating from small, dispersed airstrips. The JA 37 is the fighter version.<br><br>Saab 37 Viggen<br>Viggen is a multi-role fighter, through upgrades still modern and with some almost unique features, in service with the Swedish air force in several versions, since 1971 and until after 2006. The name Viggen means The Thunderbolt, especially those resulting from the Norse god Thor's warhammer MjÃ¶lner.<br><br>In 1952 studies were started to design a replacement for Saab Draken. "Project 1357" in 1954, was the first to have a canard layout (lots of other layouts were studied as well). I n 1961, PW JT8D-22 was the chosen engine to be locally built, with a locally designed afterburner and lots of material changes in the rest. In 1962 the design was frozen, and the prototype first flew in Feb 8:th 1967. During the 1960's, it was foreseen that the Swedish air force would purchase 800+ Viggens, but the final figure ended up at 329. In order to make the airframe smaller, it was early decided to replace the navigator with a good navigational computer. It's designed to withstand 12 G, but the limit in operation is 7 G.<br><br>Emergency power is supplied by a ram air turbine just before the left wing leading edge, which extends automatically on hydraulic power failure, and just before touch down. (Earlier, it was also always deployed whenever the landing gear was down.) The canard doesn't contribute much lift in itself during normal flight, it acts more as a gigantic vortex generator for the main wing. During low speed flight, its rear edge flap can be lowered to increase lift and permit a high nose angle.<br><br>The requirement was that the aircraft would be able to operate from 500 m runways. A short take-off run is possible due to the powerful engine (then, it was the most powerful installed in a fighter). Landing distance is reduced by several means: The HUD is used as a precision landing aid, making it possible to aim just 30 m in from the threshold; The landing gear thinks a landing sink rate of 5 m/s is normal, so landings are done without any flare; The thrust reverser is interconnected with the nose gear link, so it can be selected in the air and will operate when the nose is lowered. (It is not intended to be used in the air.)<br><br>The aircraft must be servicable very quickly by concripts with relatively short training. Re-fueling and re-arming by 7 men, of which 6 are concripts, must take less than 10 min for the JA 37 Viggen. The time limits for reconnaissance and attack configured aircraft are 15 and 20 minutes. It is said that attack squadrons expect to fly 11 missions per aircraft and 24-hour period.<br><br>Variants<br>AJ 37 Viggen<br><br>108 delivered starting in 1971, expected to remain in service until about 1998. Serial numbers 37001-37108.<br>This is the strike variant. When it was designed, guns were definitely passÃ©, so there was no provision made for an internal cannon. Dumb bombs weren't popular either, so during the preliminary design stages, the only armament considered were missiles. It wasn't until the prototypes were actually in progress of beeing built, that someone thought of incorporating wiring for iron bombs, presumably as it was realised the HUD/Weapons Aiming Computer system would enable them to be dropped with good precision.<br><br>Main armament for the anti-shipping role, a very important role, is the Saab 304 rocket-powered anti-ship missile. For ground attack, 135 mm Bofors M70 rockets in pods of six each, were together with the command controlled, smoke-less liquid fuel Saab 305 missile, the main weapons, with the 120 kg bombs and 30 mm podded guns used when appropriate. The Saab 305/Rb 05 missile is now an all round weapon, as it is rather effective against slow, large aircraft and helicopters too. A TV version was contemplated as the Rb 05B, but it was cheaper to buy Mavericks instead. It has always had a secondary fighter role, with Sidewinders and 30 mm cannon in pods. In service, it replaced the A 32A Lansen.<br><br>Sk 37 Viggen<br><br>17 delivered starting in 1973, will remain in service for a long time yet. Serial numbers 37801-37817.<br>To make room for the second cockpit, fuel and avionics was removed, so it has a shorter range and lacks a radar. The fin is taller. The rear cockpit has two periscopes to give forward vision. The trainer version wasn't planned from the outset, as it was considered enough for pilots to learn to fly delta winged aircraft on Draken trainers.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><br>SF 37 Viggen<br><br>28 delivered between 1977 and 1980, will remain in service until about 2005. Serial numbers 37950-37977.<br>All fixed cameras are carried in the nose, that lacks a radar. There are three SKa 24C-120 for horizon-to-horizon coverage, an SKa 24-57 for wide angle pictures and two SKa 31-600 for high altitude or stand off photography. There is also an IR-linescan designated VKA 702. For night photography, a pod is carried on the left fuselage station, with three SKa 34-75 cameras loaded with IR sensitive film in the front. The rear of the pod houses electronic IR flashes, as does a complementary pod on the starboard fuselage station. In service it has replaced the S 35E Draken.<br><br>JA 37 Jaktviggen<br><br>149 delivered between 1979 and 1990, will remain in service until 2010-15. Serial numbers 37301-37449.<br>By the time this version was in final design, it was clear that guns were definitely useful, so it was given the most powerful cannon a fighter has had, a 30 mm Oerlikon KCA with 150 rounds. Rate of fire is 22.5 0.36 kg rounds/s at 1050 m/s, which gives them six times more kinetic energy than the 30 mm Adens on the attack version. A unique feature is the coupling of the radar gunsighting mode to the autopilot. When the pilot places a target in a capture window, the autopilot takes over pitch and yaw, and presents bank information on the HUD for the pilot to follow. Even if it's not followed, the pitch and yaw channels have enough authority to precision aim the cannon, reducing pilot workload letting him or her concentrate on tactics and situational awareness. The fighter version has an intertial navigation system instead of the earlier versions' doppler navigation system. It is 13 cm longer, partly because the RM8B engine, which is smokeless, more powerful and better suited to high altitude than the RM8A which powers the other Viggen versions, is 8 cm longer than the RM8A. There is a three stage fan, three stage LP compressor and a seven stage HP compressor, as compared to 2/4/7 on RM8A.<br><br>The fin is the same tall one as on Sk 37 to compensate for the longer fuselage. The external tank is the same size as on the other versions, but because there's a bulge where the gun is installed, there is no room for the abbrevited top fin of the tank, instead of three fins, this tank has four fins, in a flattened 'X'. The system has gone through numerous upgrades since service entry. The radar is able to track more targets now, than at service entry, for example. The lastest software upgrade, EDIT 33, enables the JA 37 to use AMRAAM missiles. In spite of having a strengthened wing, an engine 100 kg heavier (2200 kg) and a fixed cannon, it only has an empty weight 400 kg more than earlier versions. In service it has replaced and supplemented the J 35 Draken.<br>Technical data<br><br>AJ/SH     SF        SK        JA<br>Take off run:     400 m     400 m     400 m     400 m<br>Landing run:      450 m     450 m     450 m     450 m<br>Landing speed:    220 km/h  220 km/h  220 km/h  220 km/h<br>Length:           16.30 m   16.50 m   16.30 m   16.43 m<br>Span:             10.6 m    10.6 m    10.6 m    10.6 m<br>Height:            5.6 m     5.6 m     5.6 m     5.9 m<br>w folded fin:     4.0 m     4.0 m     4.0 m     4.0 m<br>Engine thrust:    6690 kp   6690 kp   6690 kp   7415 kp<br>w afterburner:  11790 kp  11790 kp  11790 kp  13125 kp<br>Range:            2000 km   2000 km             2000 km<br>Empty weight:     9500 kg   9500 kg             9500 kg<br>Max payload:      3600 kg   2500 kg             1700 kg<br>(excluding external tank)<br>Max take off<br>weight:         18000 kg  17000 kg            18600 kg<br>Max speed                                (at 3600 kg load?)<br>low altitude:  Mach 1.1   Mach 1.1           Mach 1.2<br>high altitude: Mach 2+    Mach 2+            Mach 2+<br>Guaranteed speed<br>high altitude: Mach 1.7   Mach 1.7           Mach 1.8<br>Time from brake release to 10 km or Mach 1 at low altitude: 100 s<br>Max altitude:    18000 km   18000 m            18000 m<br><br>Type: JA 37<br>Country: Sweden<br>Function: fighter<br>Year: 1977<br>Crew: 1<br>Engines: 1 * 12750kg Volvo RM 8B<br>Wing Span: 10.60m<br>Length: 16.40m<br>Height: 5.90m<br>Wing Area: 52.20m2<br>Max.Weight: about 17000kg<br>Speed: 2124km/h<br>Ceiling: 18300m<br>Armament: 1*g30mm 6000 kg</div>
