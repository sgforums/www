            <div class='col-md body'>What do you think is the path armoured forces will take into the future? I have read about the new Isareli system where short-ranged, fast-moving projectiles can be destroyed when installed on existing armoured vehicles. There is also much talk in US about the future tank being armed with cannons which fire projectiles at very fast speeds without any propellant but by alternating magnetic fields. Do you guys seriously think that future armour forces will take the shape of Mechwarriors,Battletech,Gundam and Robotech?

            <div class='col-md body'>Reading the news these past 20 years one becomes very familiar with images of MBTs and APCs operating in urban areas.<br><br>Most cities have roads, tall buildings, drains, manholes, basements, lots of rubble and stuff to barricade etc.<br><br>Enemy can cordon off an entire area like the Jews did in the Jewish Getto battles of WW2. It took the Germans a long time to defeat the poorly-armed Jews because all their Blitzkreig-style warfare and equipment simply didn't work so well in the city.<br><br>Blackhawk Down movie showed yet another aspect of urban warfare. The US move into lightly armoured Humvees proved to be a huge mistake as speed proved to be a less useful factor than good armour.<br><br>Do you think current MBT and IFV are well-suited to urban fighting?<br><br>Or do you think urban fighting conditions demand a different breed of AFV?</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I think we do need a different breed of A vehicles for urban warfare. Just take a look at the Isarelis. Their A vehicles are certainly one of a kind and can't be found any where else in the world. This is due to the fact that they have been engaged in urban warfare for so long now and they have incoporate the experience learned into designing their vehicles.<br><br>Look at their new Merkeva MBT,they have weapons like mortars and even a compartment behind for troops. I am sure some of you must have seen pics of odd looking APCs modified from old M113 and other obsolete MBTs.<br><br>All these weird looking vehicles are specially designed for fighting in an urban environment. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"></div>

So a stored form of energy or an engine to produce a huge surge in energy is needed. normal Internal combustion engines(ICE's) just dont have that.<br>Anyway there are portable nuclear batteries.
