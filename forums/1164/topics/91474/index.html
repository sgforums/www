As you are all aware the ADCS in S'pore are usually of the rank of Major or Captain and they are distinguished by the epaulettes and yellow cords on the shoulder.Since they are the aides to the President, he would have the listening ear of the President, but I wonder if a Colonel,  Brigadier General or a General were to be in contact with the Aide de Camp , how would the conflict of rank  vs appointment be viewed, would the higher rank general give due respect  to the Aide De Camp.or vice versa?The Aide de Camp is in charge of security of thePresident, and during the Qing dynasty, the Aide de Camp to the Governor-General would be viewed as the Commander of the Governor-General's army in addition to being in charge of security.</strong><br><br>This should make it easier to read. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>ADCs are more like representatives of the position. By this I meant ADCs of the service chiefs as well. Like an assistant who gives advice and with the power to carry out the instructions on behalf of the position. The level of rank still applies but the Presidents ADC only takes orders from the man himself but has no right to disrespect any higher ranking officers.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Just one to highlight 1 point, the ADC to the President does not concern himself with the Presidents security.  That concern belongs to the Security Command, SPF.  ADC, however, does look into how the security in organize during events in-order for him to plan his party of the event. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_eek.gif" alt="Shocked" title="Shocked"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hmm! I'm not sure if its all that glam to wear a badge that dignify a soldier or cop as the number 1 pencil-pr*%k?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_neutral.gif" alt="Neutral" title="Neutral"><br><br>Maybe wearing badges are a must for officers as its a form of showing their position to other foreign forces, something like a diplomatic thing, etc.  But for a soldier &amp; a cop, its the way they accomplish their mission that defines them as who they are, badge or no badge.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_eek.gif" alt="Shocked" title="Shocked"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Actually, it is an honour to be chosen as the ADC of the President. The badge and the aguilette are merely symbols to let the others know who they are, particularly for foreign dignitries and guests meeting with the President.</div>
