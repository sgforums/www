            <div class='col-md body'>I read (think is either Janes or DefenceNews) that the US military is using the USN's PHALANX system (deployed on some low-loader) and deployed them at some US bases in Iraq as a form of CIWS against mortars launched by Iraqi insurgents against these bases.<br><br>Well, have not heard news of any coalition casualties from any these mortars lobbed against them so.... guess the system works (?).. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_surprised.gif" alt="Surprised" title="Surprised"><br><br><strong>I doubt the land-based PHALANX is available for mass-production vis-a-vis foreign sale but hey, if the PHALANX can take on small targets like mortars, surely it can take on 'BIGGER' targets like Astro rockets!</strong><br><br>Anyway, back to the question.  Remember years before, when Hizbollah tend to fire constantly those Katyusha rockets from S Lebanon and it became sort of a 'nuisance' (sometimes causing fatalities) to N Israel (esp those staying at the Kiyat Shimona area) &amp; Tel Aviv seems to be pretty helpless (short of launching a ground incursion into S Lebanon) in preventing such attacks?<br><br>DefenceNews (I think) reported that in response to this 'need', there was a joint US &amp; Israeli cooperation into developing sort of a ground-base laser that can intercept and destroy (in flight) of any incoming Katyusha rockets.  I remember seeing this on TV (a high-powered lens showing the cross-hairs on an incoming Katysuha rocket and followed by a high-beam shot on it and the rocket subsequently exploded mid-air) and it was pretty successful as it was subsequently reported that repeated trials managed to 'defeat' the rockets.<br><br>The above counter-measure systems are available (minus int'l sale) but not sure if the SAF (or any other armed forces esp those from SEA) have any current means against such threats...</div>

If aim is to cause most casulity you would go for bomblets type, which is not too effect in urban area if most people is inside the buildings. If those buildings are well designed and right material used, the effect of the bomblets can be aborbed and withstand by the materials keeping most people who are in-door safe.<br><br>For rocket that don't disperse bomblets, then it destruction power will be concentrated on the place of impact. The design of the building and material is important to contain the blast . Yes a direct hit may take out 3-4 rooms but not the whole block.<br><br>In fact in urban situation, rocket is in fact not that as effective as most think, because we seen too much movies on how easy building can be blown up. Ask demolition companies that specialise in blown down buildings, you will then understand how much tons explosives and also must be place at critical point before a building can go down.<br><br>The most is it take out a few rooms on a direct hit only. Remember 3/4 of the rocket is fuels which is quickly use up in launch. the leave over 1/4 have guidance system and other things which leave little space of explosive, just enough if combine with the speed to take out a few rooms but not enough to take bring down a whole building<br><br></div>

The incoming missile would not do much changes in itz flight pattern as this would affect much of itz accuracy and therefore, itz relatively much more easier fer anti-missile-misile system to rectify any changes in the incoming missile trajectory. For unguided rocket, my guess is itz trajectory is juz a rough estimation. The flight pattern of the unguided rocket can be greatly affected by elements like strong wind n etc. after a long distance flight therefor it would b quite hard fer any anti-unguided rocket to maintained as close as to its roughly estimated flight path as it bcomes more unstable. I guess if its impossible to calculate n rectify the unguided rocket at realtime, interception by missile wouldn't work. I know that israel has developed some sort of high intensity laser beam system that can shoot down unguided rocket. Its tested n proven n i belief the principle behind it is bcos the system had roughly estimated where the rocket might go next (matrix), n using high intensity laser beam(which travels at speed of light), it fires during dat mere miliseconds wen the unguided rocket happen to pass thru dat estimated matrix. There is certainly no way anitink not even a rocket can outrun a laser beam travelling at the speed of light being fired at it wen it crosses dat estimated matrix, therefor an almost accurate interception all the time... juz 2cents of my opinion..im no pro in rocket science...would love to hear from others perpective too</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>One of the methods currently used (in Iraq and Afghanistan as well as in Gaza Strip ) to spot enemy mortar teams and Qassam rocket launch teams are armed UAVs such as the Predator and Global Hawk (do a 'search' on 'UAV' in military.com) in the fight against terrorism. The Yanks are also using their UAVs in Iraq to hunt for IEDs.<br><br>That was how quite a number of terrorists were liquidated in the above mentioned places. UAVs can also be used for aerial recces. I think they are part of the current 3G doctrine adopted by SAF.<br><br>The operators can actually fly these UAVs remotely, say in Singapore's scenarios, in underground bunkers. Probably these dudes can be recruited from all the XBOX gamers when they enlist for NS..  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_eek.gif" alt="Shocked" title="Shocked"> <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Thanks...i have an inquisitive mind since young...I don't take things as they are...i am more concerned about how all the weapons systems work together for a particular function instead of scrutinising the specs of individual weapon systems...i want to see the big picture...  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>It have come to my notice that few of our army camps have any air raid shelters or hardened bunkers. So in the event of a surprise attack with air strikes or in this case artillery bombardment, we will be at a serious disadvantage. Because surely some of it will get through our defences.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"></div>
