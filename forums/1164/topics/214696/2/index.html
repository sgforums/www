But suspect high price forces only the elite  PLA armour unit to be equipped only(Numbering 180-300). Type96 will be the MBT to replace most Type-59 tanks(1500-2000 and still producing). U can find more news on Sinodefence.. Plenty of pictures of Type 99 in formation of few dozens in exercise with serial numbers on it. SHowing it fully deploy.</div>
