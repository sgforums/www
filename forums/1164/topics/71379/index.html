            <div class='col-md body'>To be fair cavsg, I think both magazines target different sectors, AW tends to go after the people in the industry as its readership while AFM is after the aviation enthusiasts. Hence AW's focus on getting the scoops while AFM focus on the less technical aspect and more on photos.<br><br>As for newsstand price, I might be speculating, but I would assume that the number of pics in each publication might be a factor. Speaking from the experience of doing commissioned work for such magazines, the payscale per printed pic vs text is in a different class.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>ok seems that i need to start the ball rolling<br><br>I cannot really remember how far the history of 123 but when the 350 were delivered, it was operated by 123 not 124(afm said), back in 92 period  there was a competition and 550, md defender with notar and bell kiowa was in competition to replace 350, to side track during a testing of md a rsaf pilot actually was struck in the head by the main rotor blades as the a/c sits very low on ground, back again, the 550 was selected and 6 pilots were send to france for 1st batch. koh jun teh(kohj, rsaf 1st heli test pilot, featured in a bbc documentary in 86 when they were doing a film on empire test pilot school where he was studying, his test heli was the chinnok, now heli sim center co), derrick koh his brother (later 123 co), augustine teo (current apache commander, 123 2nd co, sharp shooter on fennec), ng chee pin (now sia pilot, left rsaf as 124 instructor), surresh(i think) and an india guy if i not wrong, could be chinese.  when they come back with fennecs, the a2 and c2 operated as a single squadron, that means 123 was both training and attack. if i not wrong, there was 2 co, kohj and another koh, cannot rem his name. according to peter teo(ex sbab co, and ndp parade commander) some one in hq came up with a brilliant idea to form 124 and transfer the training part to 124, the 'enemy' will be tricked into thinking that 124 is the attack fennec sqadron and leave 123 alone. at that time the true capability of c2 was top secret. its also that time when mg han eng juan, chief army, took flying lessons at 124. he flew about 12 lessons i think and was given rsaf wings, he then went over to 123 and operated the tow on the c2.  he was instrument in bring the fennec to ex wallaby. i don't agree that only in 1996 did we test the tow, we tested earlier than that. i saw a tow that was fired in an ex and recovered much earlier than 1996.  to my knowledge, tow were never publicly carried even in sbab, they are carried only overseas.<br><br>about the current state of fennecs, afm got it wrong, a few of them are preserved at st eng and could be sold to rnzaf.  current fennec got no attack ability, questionable also. i would not reveal the current fleet but afm got it all wrong.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>There was a AS-550C2 equipped with TOW during the RSAF Open House in 1998. Would'nt it be better to have the Fennecs operating with the Apaches in the observation role like the american Kiowas and the apaches?</div>
