            <div class='col-md body'>Political and being too reliant on American hardware issues aside. It makes sense to have F-15s since we already operate a large number of american planes. The weapon systems integration will be easier. In addition, with our upgraded AWACS that has Israeli tech and missiles like pythons and ammraam, operating F-15s will make us somewhat similar to the Israelis who operates 15s and 16s. This synergy can be built with relative ease among our current systems then integrating Rafale or Typhoon.<br><br>However, it doesn't matter it's Typhoon or F-15 for me. Coz I like both. =P But.... imagine a Rafale parking side by side with the F-16s...at Tengah..... hmm... they look the same size and makes me wonder does the Rafale does alot of things the F-16s cannot do. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"> hmmm... &lt;== just a farnee feeling. Rafale is a good jet.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>frm eurofighter.com<br><br>Eurofighter Typhoon Downselect in Singapore  10 October 2003<br><br>Eurofighter GmbH is pleased to announce notification of a decision by the Defence Science and Technology Agency (DSTA) in Singapore to downselect Typhoon for the final stage of the countryÂ’s Next Fighter Replacement (NFR) competition.<br><br>Commenting on the downselect announcement, Filippo Bagnato, Chief Executive Officer Eurofighter GmbH stated; Â‘I believe the decision by Singapore is a clear recognition of the power behind the Eurofighter partnership. We are fully committed with our partners to demonstrating the technical and performance capabilities of the Weapon System. This is combined with a clear route for technology transfer that will seek to enhance core indigenous capabilities in Singapore. Alongside this effort we will also work to further develop a powerful industrial partnership between SingaporeÂ’s high technology industry and EuropeÂ’s leading defence and aerospace companies - Alenia Aeronautica, BAE SYSTEMS and EADS.Â’<br><br>This initial success in Singapore is a further indication of the growing credibility and maturity of the Eurofighter programme as a new generation fighter. Following Type Acceptance of the Weapon System by the four nation customers in Germany, Italy, Spain and the United Kingdom, covering a programme for 620 aircraft plus an option for a further 90 aircraft, Eurofighter has also been selected by Austria to meet their requirements for a new generation fighter.<br><br>Eurofighter Typhoon is unique in representing core operational and industrial capabilities of the European defence and aerospace industry. A major factor in extending this capability and industrial potential is an understanding of the principle of a credible partnership that incorporates Government, Air Force and industrial participation in the programme. The Eurofighter Partner Companies and EUROJET are committed to extending the technical and industrial potential of the programme through high quality/high performance technology transfer with potential export customers.<br><br></div>

Singapore, however, could still place a follow-on order for F-16s.<br><br>Boeing, Dassault and Eurofighter will now respond to a tender for eight fighters, with the winner to be selected in late 2004 or 2005 and deliveries starting in 2008 or 2009. Singapore's ministry of defence, which had been planning a 10 aircraft buy plus 10 options, now says a follow-on purchase for 12-16 fighters is possible "in the near future".<br><br>Many anticipated the Rafale would be eliminated because it made after-deadline revisions after the French government dropped financial support for the export variant. Dassault is now offering Singapore the option of investing in a new variant, with upgraded Snecma engines and Thales avionics.<br><br>Singapore is entertaining this proposal because of the extra work it would provide for Singapore Technologies Aerospace. But it is still considered a long shot because of the anticipated steep development price tag and the likelihood it will not be ready by 2008.<br><br>The F-15T, probably equipped with Raytheon's active electronically scanned APG-63 radar, requires the least local work and is the most certain to meet the 2008 requirement.<br><br>Industry sources say Lockheed is surprised the F-16 was rejected given Singapore's current F-16 inventory. But Singapore could still opt for more F-16s - either on top of or instead of a new fighter - as it re-evaluates its force structure next year</div>

I don't know why we didn't get it in the end, but it was not because someone's parliament vetoed it.<br><br><blockquote><strong><br><br>We have a airforce without anti-ship capability.  Missile speaking.</strong></blockquote>Not true. We have at least 2 recorded purchases of air-launched Harpoons on a public list of US DoD contracts. Fokker PR pics show the yet-to-be-delivered (at the time when the pics were taken) MPAs carrying dummy Harpoons. There are other Harpoon-capable types, but I won't/can't say which types. (even though it does not need a genius to figure out).<br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>
