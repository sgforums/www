            <div class='col-md body'>Typhoon Warning<br>Aviation Week &amp; Space Technology<br>05/05/2003, page 39<br><br>Douglas Barrie<br>London<br><br>Any cut in RAF Typhoons would also raise a question mark over the number of Meteor missiles the Defense Ministry is to procure. Meteor will provide the aircraft with its primary medium- to long-range air-to-air weapon when it enters service around 2012. The six-nation program, being led by the U.K., is viewed as a key element in sustaining and developing Europe's guided-weapon industrial base.<br><br>Industry and government representatives from the four Typhoon nations are working on a "fast track" approach to finally agreeing on the major elements of Tranche 2. This could clear the way for inking the letter of intent (LOI) by late June or early July, with contract signature in September or October.<br><br>The LOI would free seed funding for Tranche 2, and avoid any hiatus on related development work as the partner nations and industry attempt to complete contract details.<br><br>The Tranche 2 aircraft will have a greater air-to-surface capability than initial-batch Typhoons. Batch-one aircraft are limited to the carriage and delivery of dumb and laser-guided bombs. Detailing the air-to-surface weapon inventory to be integrated as part of the Tranche 2 development effort is one of the key tasks now being undertaken.<br><br>As part of this process, the RAF is understood to be working on a priority listing of air-to-surface weaponry it wants included in Tranche 2 development. There are also efforts to try to introduce a precision-guided bomb capability on the aircraft earlier in Tranche 1 than previously planned.<br><br>Meanwhile, the Austrian government has confirmed its intent to buy 18 Typhoons, with a contract signature later this year.<br><br>Some U.S. analysts believe the aircraft's export potential will have been further bolstered by the political upshot of the war in Iraq. Given the discomfort felt by several pro-Western Arab states over the conflict, they may be less inclined to buy U.S. combat aircraft.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Eurofighter Typhoon service entry looms at last<br>Aviation Week &amp; Space Technology<br>06/16/2003, page 128<br><br>Douglas Barrie<br>Munich<br><br>The Tranche 1 buy comprises 148 aircraft. Two further tranches are also covered by a 620-aircraft umbrella contract between the partner nations and industry.<br><br>However, once more in keeping with the partner nations' apparent inability to follow any path of least resistance, in parallel with service introduction, the four also are trying to hammer out the production contract on Tranche 2, recast its scope and possibly draw in elements of Tranche 3. As if this were not challenging enough, there are also indications the British government is being forced to reconsider acquisition numbers, which now stand at 232 with an option for a further 60. Meanwhile, the RAF has torn up its long-standing fielding plan in order to better reflect emerging operational needs.<br>The critical nature of getting Tranche 2 right is reinforced by two key issues: the changing concept of operations with regard to the aircraft, and the emerging budgetary pressures on the projected Tranche 3 production run.<br><br>The Typhoon--or the European Fighter Aircraft as originally conceived in the mid-1980s--is at least conceptually a "legacy" program. Driven by the need to find a successor to the partner air forces' inventory of air-defense aircraft--the British Tornado F3, German F-4, Spanish F-18, and Italian F-104--EFA was designed primarily for the air-to-air role.<br><br>As the recent war with Iraq has clearly evinced, serried ranks of threat fighters to be met in beyond-visual-range engagements no longer constitutes the most likely operational scenario.<br><br>The Iraqi air force, perhaps motivated by self-preservation, remained resolutely on the ground throughout the war. And while there was a latent, if limited, air-to-air threat, it failed to materialize. The likely majority of future conflicts Typhoon partners are liable to become embroiled in will surely see a preponderance of airpower in their favor. Such superiority, however, does not negate the need for an aircraft fully capable in air-to-air combat. Even given near-assured air dominance--part of the benefit of involvement in any U.S.-led coalition--the continuing export of third- and fourth-generation combat aircraft suggests some potential adversaries could still pose an air threat.<br><br>In limited conflicts, the ability to defeat a Western coalition increasingly may not have to constitute denying air supremacy, but rather inflicting only a publicly unacceptable level of loss. At its most extreme, ponder how many B-2s (or eventually F-22s) the U.S. public, or indeed the Pentagon, would consider as acceptable losses in a conflict such as Iraq, or Kosovo.<br><br>In the case of Europe, this then pushes toward the acquisition of platforms capable of being used to prosecute an air campaign predicated on air-to-surface engagements, while sustaining more than sufficient air-to-air capacity.<br><br>Reflecting this shift, the RAF is looking to transition its rollout of the aircraft into squadron service from dedicated units to an all-multirole force structure. This would see seven multirole squadrons available by around 2011.<br><br>RAF Air Commodore Chris Harper, who is responsible for Typhoon, argued in a recent presentation that this change "spread the operational loading" while also offering "significantly enhanced flexibility."<br><br>The initial RAF service-entry road map foresaw the creation of four dedicated air defense squadrons, to be followed by an air-to-surface squadron, and then two multirole units.<br><br>Rather fortuitously, Typhoon was conceived from the outset with a latent secondary air-to-surface capability.<br><br>Within both Tranches 1 and 2 there's an increased emphasis on developing, and expanding, this capability as rapidly as possible to maximize the utility of what will be a key platform for the customer nations.<br><br>All of this, however, is being carried out in the context of budgetary pressures among all of the partners, with the inevitable gap between desirability and affordability to be negotiated.<br><br>"In addition to the Typhoon's inherent air-to-air capability, we have to offer in a more flexible way an increased air-to-surface capability," Bagnato acknowledged.<br><br>"Tranche 1 is not only an air-to-air platform; there is already within the full operational capability an initial air-to-ground capacity. The Tranche 2 concept is to build on this capability, so the aircraft is already prepared for the integration of new weapons," he added.<br><br>The air-to-surface capability within Tranche 1, however, is severely constrained by the paucity of air-to-surface weapons to be integrated on the aircraft at this stage.<br><br>The first batch of Tranche 1 aircraft for the RAF, as initially configured, are suitable only for air-defense training and operational test and evaluation. The batch-two aircraft will have a moderately improved capability with the inclusion of the multifunction information distribution system (MIDS), the first iteration of the defensive aids subsystem (DASS), and the ability to utilize the Paveway II laser-guided bomb.<br><br>Tranche 2 is where a much broader range of air-to-surface weaponry is now planned to be introduced, supported by the requisite sensor fusion, and full DASS capabilities.<br><br>Harper outlined British priorities for Tranche 2 to include Enhanced Paveway II and laser designator pod capability, to be followed by the Storm Shadow cruise missile, and Meteor air-to-air missile. The yet-to-be-selected winner of the British Precision-Guided Bomb competition will also be integrated within the Tranche 2 standard.<br><br>The integration of a reconnaissance pod, as part of enhanced operational capability (EOC) 2, also is being considered. One of the emerging lessons of the war with Iraq is the continuing need for crewed tactical reconnaissance. These upgrades are to be implemented in two stages: EOC 1, in 2007-08, and EOC 2, 2009-10.<br><br>Eurofighter officials have asked the respective partner nations to come up with a priority list of air-to-surface weapons to be integrated within the context of the Tranche 2 program; however, industry sources say this continues to be very much a work in progress.<br><br>The weapons "wish list" is increasingly facing the litmus test of fiscal reality, and it's likely some will either be pushed back or removed completely.<br><br>"On additional weapon integration, we don't always want to have to go back to the beginning [in terms of clearances]," Bagnato said. "The Tranche 2 avionics architecture is intended to allow us to avoid this--for both air-to-surface and air-to-air weapons."<br><br>"We want to avoid what happened on the Tornado, where the three partner nations ended up with 17 variants of the basic type. Once you lose commonality, you lose much of the cost-effectiveness of a joint program," noted Massimo Tarantola, the Eurofighter support program director.<br><br>"The concept with the Typhoon is for 2-3-year regular updates, while also accommodating any urgent operational requirements. But I need to know [what these are] to be able to put them into the baseline configuration for the aircraft. Every two years or so, I will offer all the modifications, and the same will apply with new developments," he added.<br><br>Central to this idea is the International Weapon System Support Center recently established at Halbergmoos, near Munich. The IWSSC has been set up "to maintain central control of the entire weapon system support process and resources," according to Eurofighter.<br><br>However, as Tarantola recognized, in making this work over the life of the program, "the real problem [among the operators] is going to be discipline."<br><br>Regardless of how good an idea the IWSSC is, it can only be as effective as the customers will allow. If partner nations pursue a path similar to that of the Tornado, with the rapid emergence of discrete national variants, then the IWSSC will be sidelined, left to watch costs spiral as commonality is squandered.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Korean F-15Ks Specialized for Air, Sea and Ground Combat<br>Aviation Week &amp; Space Technology<br>08/11/2003, page 29<br><br>David A. Fulghum<br>St. Louis<br><br>South Korea's F-15Ks are to be specialized for air, sea and ground combat as part of a network-centric force<br><br>Boeing's ROK Star<br><br>Boeing is nearing completion of its design for the Republic of Korea (ROK) Air Force's F-15K, as part of a $4.2-billion deal that will provide Seoul with the 40 most modern F-15s in the world--specialized for air-to-air combat as well as ground attack and maritime strike.<br><br>They will be the first F-15s with 15 smart weapons stations--six more than current operational F-15Es--that could arm the aircraft with 15,500-lb. joint direct attack munition bombs, if desired, said Steve Winkler, Boeing's director of F-15 production programs. Smart weapons stations allow updated target information to be transferred into weapons up to the point of launch for greater accuracy. First flight is slated for March 2005 with delivery of two aircraft to South Korea to follow in November 2005.<br><br>A $3.6-billion direct commercial sale buys the aircraft from Boeing, according to company documents. A $300-million foreign military sale provides F-15E training from the U.S. Air Force, cryptographic equipment and AIM-120 medium-range missiles. The U.S. Navy is to supply AGM-84 Harpoon, Slam-ER and AIM-9X missiles. A second $300-million contract with Samsung TechWin covers the General Electric F110-129 engines. It is the first time production F-15s have come equipped with GE engines.<br><br>The F-15Ks will be multi-role fighters and strike aircraft, the latest in the lineage that includes the U.S. Air Force's F-15E, the Royal Saudi Air Force's F15S and the Israel Air Force's F-15I. USAF will provide F-15E training to the Korean aircrews, and Boeing will subsequently provide additional training on the F-15K's maritime systems and the latest modifications. Many of the modifications are on the U.S. fighter road map to be added at a later date.<br><br>Another wrinkle, in addition to the maritime package, is the decision to equip the F-15Ks with the General Electric F110-129 engines, said other aerospace industry officials. Korea had equipped its F-16 frontline combat aircraft with Pratt &amp; Whitney engines. But with the worry that a systemic engine problem could ground the whole fleet, planners decided to diversify their engine suppliers.<br><br>Boeing is currently completing the aircraft's subsystem designs. These include major pieces of avionics including upgraded jammers, radar warning receivers and chaff/flare dispensers.<br><br>The Koreans have ordered a software development test facility so they can develop their own upgrades for the aircraft's advanced core processor and programmable armaments control set, Winkler said. While the U.S. doesn't turn over source codes for the radar and electronic warfare equipment, Korea has ordered an electronic warfare programming station that allows Korean specialists to modify the threats, techniques and parameters, he said.<br><br>THE AIRCRAFT will come with the APG63(V)1 radar (air-to-ground and air-to-sea search and track modes added) using a mechanically scanned antenna, Winkler said. Again there is the option to later upgrade to an active electronically scanned array. AESA radars are more powerful and multifunctional, according to other aerospace officials. While many aspects are classified, it offers longer range and better discrimination of small, stealthy targets like cruise missiles even in ground clutter. It also can simultaneously be used to jam enemy electronics, they said. The F-15's large radar housing allows installation of an antenna with thousands of elements which makes the system virtually maintenance free and extremely reliable.<br><br>An infrared search and track system (IRST) allows the aircraft to operate in an electronically passive mode to avoid revealing its position or identity. The system also offers a multi-spectral view of the battlefield and environment for better situational awareness. There is also a third-generation targeting and navigation pod, as well as a night-vision-compatible cockpit.<br><br>Along with its expansive range of weapons and sensors, the F-15K will carry real-time communications data links for establishing a targeting network with airborne early warning and control aircraft and electronic warfare aircraft. These capabilities look ahead to Korea's E-X program.<br><br>"It appears that the South Korean Air Force is heading in the direction of establishing a network," Winkler said. "They wanted Link 16 [data links] on their F-15Ks. It makes a lot of sense for a command and control network."<br><br>In meeting Korea's special needs, the new aircraft will carry: a single box Identification Friend or Foe system that includes interrogator, transponder and cryptographic function; ARC-232 combination UHF/VHF radio; dual embedded GPS/INS navigation systems; Advanced Display Core Processor and 6-in. LCDS displays; a new Tacan; Link 16 fighter data link (for network-centric operations) and a joint helmet-mounted cuing system that in combination with the AIM-9X will give an improved air-to-air as well as ground and maritime strike capabilities.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>F-15 : Proven platform, fastest to deploy as most of the technology will be tested out on the K. Based on 60's technology, maintanence will be longer compared to Typhoon and Rafale. Panels and access are designed in the 60's. Its more difficult to carry out 100/0 hourly servicing, although compared to the other 2, there is a wealth of engineering knowledge after 30 years of service. No more roadmap for development. Only way to counter the flanker in short term, pilots can start training long before aircraft is build.<br>Rafale: Most expensive of the 3 in terms of maintainence. Roadmap unclear. Least likely candidate unless French are willing to give away technology that is irresistable by SG. French base will close or scale down if it lose and skyhawks retire.<br>Typhoo: Large order of aircrafts meant its future is secured. Most likely winner unless RSAF wants to deploy an aircraft that can counter the flanker in 2006 timeframe. Delivery of aircraft depends on whether RSAF takes Tranche 2 or 3. No MRM capability till meteor deployed in 2012. RSAF will have a new training location.</div>

Darren Lake reports on how the aircraft will evolve to provide the Aeronautique Navale with a potent air defence and strike capability out to 2040.<br><br>Twenty years ago, France departed a five-nation European programme for a future fighter aircraft. It did so for two main reasons: first, that its prospective collaborative partners were unwilling to accept French demands for design and industrial leadership: and second, France wanted a smaller and lighter aircraft which, as well as serving the needs of the Armee de lÂ’Air, could also be adapted for operations off the deck of its new nuclear-powered aircraft carrier Charles de Gaulle.<br><br>The Aeronautique Navale (Aeronavale) required this new multirole fighter to replace its existing inventory of venerable F-8(FN) Crusader interceptors and Super Etendard strike aircraft. The new aircraft was also required to contribute to FranceÂ’s nuclear deterrent carrying a sub-strategic standoff missile.<br><br>This was in contrast to the air-superiority bias of the UK, Germany, Italy and Spain. And so in July 1985 France took the difficult, but necessary decision to go it alone, leaving the other four nations to press ahead with the Eurofighter programme. A national solution, led by French aerospace giant Dassault Aviation, would instead yield a new combat aircraft capable of meeting both air force and navy requirements from the turn of the century until around 2040. And so Rafale (Â‘squallÂ’) was born.<br><br><strong>Rafale variants </strong><br><br>While the French NavyÂ’s requirements have in many ways conditioned the conception and design of Rafale, the Aeronavale will in fact receive only 60 aircraft (roughly 20% of FranceÂ’s total planned purchase of 294 aircraft). Original plans had called for 84 naval variants to be produced, but this offtake was scaled back in 1996.<br><br>FranceÂ’s early plans called for the development of three distinct versions of a fighter in the 22t-plus category. Two of these would be pursued for the Armee de lÂ’Air - the single-seat C and two-seat B variants - while the navy would take delivery of a single-seat variant dubbed the Rafale M. Commonality between the three platforms would be extensive, with the two single-seat systems, for example, expected to share 80% of their components at the airframe and system levels.<br><br>The naval and air force variants would feature only minor design changes, such as the addition of a strengthened nosewheel capable of withstanding the stresses of catapult launches and carrier landings. A number of other capabilities would be introduced, with the aircraft optimised for embarked operations - for example, its lengthened forward undercarriage would enable the fighter to be launched in a more nose-up attitude, removing the need for a ski-jump.<br><br>Changing operational requirements and the experience of the French military in fighting the 1999 Kosovo campaign led to a revision of these service needs, and most notably to the addition of a fourth variant, the two-seat Rafale N, to the airframeÂ’s existing maritime stable. Again featuring a high level of commonality with the Armee de lÂ’AirÂ’s B version, this would benefit from the addition of a weapon system operator (WSO) in the aircraftÂ’s rear crew position.<br><br>In common with other two-seat fighter designs such as the Typhoon, BoeingÂ’s F/A-18F Super Hornet and the Block 60 F-16, future operations of the Rafale B and N could see the aircraftÂ’s pilot concentrate on the deployment of beyond-visual-range air-to-air missiles, while the rear-seat WSO will simultaneously manage the deployment of air-to-surface munitions. Other roles expected of the aircraft will include reconnaissance and anti-ship operations.<br><br>Only approved for development and production in December 2002, the Rafale N will represent the majority of the navyÂ’s Rafale order, with 35 aircraft to be built alongside 25 single-seat Ms. This late preference to acquire two-seat fighters was also mirrored by a revision to the Armee de lÂ’AirÂ’s planned order book for the aircraft, which will now total 139 Bs and just 95 Cs.<br><br><strong>Operational activity </strong><br><br>It is more than slightly ironic that FranceÂ’s efforts to field a domestically developed fighter have borne fruit before those of the collaborative project that it walked out of. While the four remaining Eurofighter nations are just starting to take delivery of their first aircraft, France already has more than two yearsÂ’ experience in operating production examples of its Rafale M.<br><br>Ten of these are now in limited service with the with the AeronavaleÂ’s Flotille 12 (12F) squadron. The unit reformed with the new aircraft in May 2001 and declared initial operating capability with the type in October 2002. This followed the aircraftÂ’s seven-month deployment aboard the nuclear-powered aircraft carrier Charles de Gaulle from December 2001, to participate in training in the Indian Ocean.<br><br>It was not long, however, before the aircraft was called on to support the US-led Operation Â‘Enduring FreedomÂ’ against Afghanistan in the wake of the 11 September 2001 terrorist attacks on the US mainland. FranceÂ’s lone carrier remained in the region for part of this campaign, and its Rafales conducted their first combat air patrols in co-operation with the US military. Seven Rafales were embarked during these operations, in addition to 16 Super Etendards and two E-2C Hawkeye airborne early warning and control aircraft.<br><br>Operations of the Rafale to date have taken tested the aircraftÂ’s current capability in the air-defence role, where the type offers a loiter time of over three hours. While the navy has yet to conduct its first aerial engagement with the new aircraft, it has already amassed considerable experience in operating the design.<br><br>"The 12F squadron is not yet operational; it is still testing the aircraft and its environment, including its ability to maintain the aircraft, both at Landivisiau [air base in Brittany] and aboard the Charles de Gaulle," said SIRPA Marine Chief Capt Christophe Prazuck. Embarked operations of the Rafale M have so far demonstrated the typeÂ’s ability to sustain up to 300 flying hours per year in the carrier environment, according to Dassault.<br><br>In time, FranceÂ’s carrier will sail with a maximum air wing of up to 40 aircraft, comprising the Rafale M/N, Super Etendard ModernisÃ© ground-attack aircraft, E-2C Hawkeye and support helicopters. The vessel is currently undergoing a period of scheduled maintenance at its homeport of Toulon, and is expected to take to sea again during November 2003. 12FÂ’s aircraft are currently operating from Landivisiau, awaiting their next opportunity to go to sea.<br><br>The Rafale will be much more than an interceptor, however, and from later this decade will boast a full air-to-surface and anti-ship strike capability for use in future contingencies. This will allow the navy to replace its two remaining squadrons of ageing Super Etendard ModernisÃ© aircraft with Rafale-equipped units, in 2007 and 2010.<br><br>The AeronavaleÂ’s initial 10 aircraft were delivered to the service in the so-called F1 software configuration, which offers a basic air-defence capability. The F1 standard enables the Rafale M to carry out its duties armed with MBDAÂ’s MICA EM (active radar-guided) and Magic 2 air-to-air missiles.<br><br>Deliveries to the service will resume from 2005 at a rate of six aircraft per year in the F2 configuration, which will add new capabilities in the air-to-air and ground-attack roles. The aircraft now with 12F will be upgraded to this standard from 2008, according to current plans. However, the potential of the F2 system will be demonstrated as early as 2004, when it will be tested by 12F aircraft assigned to the Charles de Gaulle for its next period at sea.<br><br>Final deliveries of the Rafale M/N will be made in 2012 in the future F3 standard, which will further expand the aircraftÂ’s sensor capabilities and weapons flexibility.<br><br>The Armee de lÂ’Air has so far taken delivery of just five Rafale B/Cs, and is waiting on the availability of the multirole F2 software standard before it fields the aircraft in frontline squadron service from 2006.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>Squall from the sea</strong><br><br>Continued...<br><br><strong>Weapons range </strong><br><br>Development work is already under way by French industry, the military and the DÃ©lÃ©gation GÃ©nÃ©rale pour lÂ’Armement procurement agency to prepare F2 software, which will add a range of weapon types including MBDAÂ’s SCALP-EG air-launched cruise missile, SagemÂ’s AASM range of precision-guided bombs and the MICA IR (infrared/heat-seeking) medium-range air-to-air missile. The F2 system will achieve operating capability in mid-2006 and receive a full release to service in 2008, according to the Armee de lÂ’Air, which will be the first to operate the standard.<br><br>The Rafale M could be cleared for operations with the standoff SCALP-EG weapon as soon as 2004, having already undergone embarked trials. The more than 250km-range design is already in UK service as the Storm Shadow. The Royal Air Force deployed 27 of the weapons during Operation Â‘Iraqi FreedomÂ’ earlier this year.<br><br>Looking further ahead, the F3 standard will add advanced reconnaissance capabilities, and weapons such as MBDAÂ’s AM39 Exocet anti-ship missile and its developmental ASMP-A air-launched nuclear missile.<br><br>Trials conducted in December 2002 saw a Rafale M operate with a mechanical model of the ASMP-A to record vibration and stress readings of the weapon. The aircraft flew 12 sorties from the Charles de Gaulle over a seven-day period with the model carried on its centreline. "The results from this campaign were successful," according to an MBDA release. The new weapon will have a maximum range of around 500km, and will augment the navyÂ’s current nuclear strike force. This comprises four strategic missile submarines assigned to its Strategic Oceanic Force, and a number of Super Etendards equipped with the baseline ASMP system.<br><br>Among the reconnaissance systems under consideration for use at this point are ThalesÂ’ Damocles laser designation pod, which will offer the aircraft a full day-and-night laser-guided bombing capability, and a planned Reco-NG system. Damocles is already being procured to equip the Super Etendard ModernisÃ©, but could also see use with naval Rafales until the next-generation pod is available for use.<br><br>An F4 standard is also now envisioned, according to Sqn Ldr Michel Dupont, Assistant Rafale Programme Manager for the Armee de lÂ’Air. This is expected to add MBDAÂ’s Meteor beyond-visual-range air-to-air missile to the aircraft, and possibly a new anti-radiation missile for use during future suppression of enemy air defence tasks. A next-generation supersonic anti-ship missile could also be introduced at this time, although Capt Prazuck says that "we are not in the process of defining and developing a new anti-ship weapon at this time". France halted development of an air-launched Anti-Navire Futur weapon system over two years ago.<br><br>Naval Rafales have 13 hard points, and can carry a maximum load of more than 9,000kg. Five of the aircraftÂ’s stores points are wet stations, suitable for carrying external fuel tanks or heavy ordnance. The aircraft shares the air forceÂ’s Giat Industries-supplied Defa 791B 30mm cannon, though this will not be integrated with the two-seat N variant to enable space to be freed up for additional fuel storage.<br><br>While it has an unrefuelled radius of action of over 1,000nm in the penetration role, the Rafale has a fixed but removable refuelling probe to support longer-range sorties. The navyÂ’s aircraft have already received clearance to operate with tankers using the US Navy-standard hose-and-drogue system, and have also conducted trials with a buddy-buddy refuelling tank carried on the aircraftÂ’s centreline. A Rafale M has already refuelled another Rafale and a Super Etendard during trials of this system.<br><br><strong>Key systems </strong><br><br>In concert with the introduction of new weapon and sensor systems, the availability of the enhanced software standards will also bring out the full mission capabilities of the Rafale airframe and its systems over the coming years. In addition it will also enable the aircraft to assume a variety of extra roles, such as its possible use as a flight controller for a number of unmanned combat air vehicles (UCAVs). This concept is being considered by the Armee de lÂ’Air as a future capability.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>Squall from the sea</strong><br><br>Continued...<br><br>The full utility of the Rafale will be achieved through the fusion of sensor data from a number of aircraft systems, primarily its RBE2 radar, front sector optronics (OSF) sensors and Spectra electronic warfare (EW) suite. Situational awareness and other command-and-control information will be relayed using Link 16 (enabled by a Multifunction Information Distribution System terminal). Taken individually, these systems offer an impressive capability, but Dassault officials say that it is only once this complex data fusion has been achieved that they will deliver their warfighting edge.<br><br>Developed by Thales, the RafaleÂ’s RBE2 electronically scanned array fire-control radar can currently identify 40 tracks, and target up to eight of these at any time in the air-to-air mode. In addition to tracking multiple airborne targets, the system will also be able to provide ground maps for navigation and targeting tasks, detect and track multiple maritime targets, and produce three-dimensional maps for terrain-following flight. This capability is, in time, expected to enable the aircraft to sustain low-altitude flight in Â‘hands-offÂ’ mode down to a height of around 100ft above land and 50ft over water. This will assist in the deployment of key future weapon systems, such as anti-ship missiles.<br><br>Thales Optronics and Sagem are co-developing the RafaleÂ’s OSF system, which features TV and passive IR search-and-rack sensors and an eye-safe laser rangefinder. These will enable the crew to identify airborne, maritime and ground targets visually from standoff range and to deploy advanced weapon systems under jamming conditions. The system will also support the crew in conducting battle damage assessment tasks. Self-defence will be achieved using the MBDA/Thales Spectra EW system, which incorporates a precise threat-location capability for use against airborne and ground-based threats. The design also incorporates an electronic countermeasures suite to protect its host aircraft against a variety of threats.<br><br>The extensive use of composite materials is of benefit in reducing aircraft weight and corrosion - factors that will lead to each Rafale achieving some 7,000 flight hours during its operational life. Dassault estimates that this will see each aircraft have a service life in the region of 30 years.<br><br>Prospects for additional sales of the navalised Rafale beyond those 60 to be built for the Aeronavale are not encouraging. The aircraft was one of a number of types evaluated by the UK in the formative stages of the latterÂ’s Future Carrier Borne Aircraft (FCBA) programme, but was always regarded as a rank outsider. It came as little surprise when the UK in early 2001 identified the Joint Strike Fighter as its preferred FCBA solution.<br><br>India is also reported to have shown interest in the naval Rafale in connection with its requirement for a new carrier-borne fighter. However, many observers suggest that this is simply to gain leverage with Russia in price negotiations for the purchase of the carrier Admiral Gorshkov and MiG-29K Fulcrum fighters.<br><br>On the domestic stage, FranceÂ’s planned construction of a sister ship for the Charles de Gaulle is not expected to lead to a follow-on order for the Rafale. Operations of the projected Â‘Porte Avions 2Â’ are expected to start from 2014.<br><br>"There will not be any more aircraft in the navy," Capt Prazuck told JNI. The service will sustain one air group equipped with Rafales, Hawkeyes and helicopters, and this must be capable of meeting all operational and training requirements. Capt Prazuck notes that both carriers could be deployed simultaneously in the future, for example with one deployed operationally and the second in use for training purposes or on build-up with a fighter presence embarked.<br><br><strong>Beyond the Rafale </strong><br><br>Early operational experience suggests that FranceÂ’s unique requirements will be ably met for many years to come by one of the most potent fighters now entering service anywhere in the world. In its naval guise aboard the Charles de Gaulle, the Rafale is already enabling the French Navy to conduct global power-projection operations, and to hold court with the US Navy.<br><br>However, Rafale is almost certain to be among the last generation of manned combat aircraft indigenously produced to meet a purely national requirement. In 1985 the French government felt able to bear the cost and interoperability issues associated with undertaking a national rather than collaborative programme.<br><br>Cost alone makes it unlikely that such a decision could be made next time around. Rather, the US-led F-35 Joint Strike Fighter, and pan-European interest in collaborative Unmanned Combat Air Vehicle developments point the way to the future.<br></div>
