            <div class='col-md body'>i feel that young MOs seem more enthusiastic in their job.<br><br>i don't remember much about the MO that inspected me 4 years ago, but the young MO i met last month seemed quite concern about my just-healed bone fracture and told me to report any pain no matter how insignificant in future.<br><br>coincidentally, he trained under the NUH doctor (or assistant professor) that diagnosed and performed surgery on me.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>yo wuming :<br><br>Your points are totally valid.  Certainly agree that irresponsible publicising is not desirable.  We had a tip from a forummer, we tried to scan the newspapers, check out the net for any mention and found nothing.  So we put up something and wonder ... We are glad to see some bros in this forum explaining "what really happened", the bros' explanation seems reasonable, it appears to be a totally freak accident and so Mindef is not at fault in this instance then.  But what if ... it was another 2Sg Hu case? No one publicises it, it gets "covered", how do we prevent this abuse from occurring?  To get to the stage of worrying about irresponsible publication, we must have a culture of open publication first, i guess ... anyway thanks for your responses; this is a great forum, arguments are sensible and this kind of spirit is whats needed for Singapore and which is what our site is aiming for.<br><br>laterz<br>Lau Ah Pek</div>
