They want to increae the price of water so what? go to war? i think pay the amount would be more cheaper than war. Its their water afterall..why so ^&amp;!$$hcy about it?</blockquote>Obviously you do not understand the issue at all. How naive can you possibly be? No one should take you seriously. You can raise the price of water all you want. But will singapore pay? Obviously not. Then what happens? `Potong' water supply? Then it will be war as water is regarded as sacred and essential to life.<br><br>We will never pay the increase in water costs unless we get an equitable return in terms of benefit. It is a testament to how powerful and conversely, how weak Malaysia is getting what she wants for what is obviously thier water. Im sure it aches on a daily basis. Especially for that twit who has brought more shame for Malaysia than anyone else; that Mat-hatter.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hehe. As usual, the Malaysians like to sing first before they are done working on whatever they are working on. Not the first time they have embarked on massive projects. Just look at what has happened to the rest.  It`s the systems(legislation, efficiency, etc) they put in place which counts; which they do not have. Anybody in SEA is capable of building large infrastructure projects.<br><br>Actually, MM knows exactly what he his talking about. Johor is not Shenzen or China. They are worlds apart. Malaysia is not even remotely close to China where competitiveness is concerned.<br><br>He is actually alluding to the system which favours the ethnic Malays in Malaysia. It is a theme he has been repeating again and again. Just packaged differently. In some ways, he is saying that it is pointless to invest there because the bumi princes(not the majority malays who are good) will put thier interests in acquiring wealth first above everything else. Investors wil be able to discern what he is trying to say.<br><br>The IDR, like all the other projects, will end in failure simply because the bumi leadership is deprived of good leadership, management and above all, integrity. And especially in Johor; the heart of the racist UMNO government..It will also fail simply because competing with Singapore means changing entire system and lifestyles. They know they could not do it. The so-called joint IDR committee between Singapore and Malaysia is simply a platform for Malaysia to ask for concessions from Singapore to ease off pressure in certain sectors so that the IDR will get some investments to grow. You`d think Singapore is not too smart to play along? Remember the MSC? They wanted our `software' and managing expertise after building the infrastructure under the pretext of joint cooperation. We basically gave them the third finger. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"></div>

Radicalizes Umno means a more hostil MY / Indo against SG.<br><br>for SG To continue siding with US or PRC? knowing that PRC has sign treaty with MY, and PRC does not see eye to eye with Uncle Sam.

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote>dude, why would i want to raise the water supply..im not even malaysian.(well i work there but that doesnt count) </blockquote>Well, now..you dont have to burn your brain cells to figure that one out...<br><br><blockquote><br>if malaysian want to raise the price of water its their right. Their water they can do it and if we see it in terms of economic they should.<br><br>why would we dont want to pay the increase? singapore a rich nation. Oil price keep raising , the same can be said on fresh water around the world, the cheapest is what they sold to us right now...a freaking 3 sen...the nearest to that is free water. Heck even the newater more expensive than that.<br><br>so singapore willing to trade life with 3 sen? that is so dumb!<br><br>"hey dude why singapore went to war man?..so many died economy destroyed..infrastructure destroyed...";<br><br>"alah..those prick north want to increase water price meh.. singapore dont want to pay..so they cut...a then we attack ma..."<br></blockquote>Lol. You have just effectively said what I wrote up there. Let me see if this helps....<br><br>Raise price but we dont pay unless we feel it is justified. Raise price= no war.  Water supply continue and we pay at the same price. But let`s say you cease the supply. Then it becomes war. cut water= war.<br><br>Price is never the issue for war. We will pay if we believe it is justified. This has  been made clear so many times. The word is `justified.' It is about trade-offs for both sides.<br><br>The original treaty was never about economics. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"> You signed it <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"> It is about Singapore`s viability as a state. So, anyways, Malaysia is stuck like Pedra Branca which is rightfully ours as well. There is nothing you can do about it saved risking a war you could not afford to have. You can even send a letter demanding more money. But we simply would not pay. Will you cut the supply then? You could not. Hence the problem for you.</div>
