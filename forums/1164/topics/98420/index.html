They're fanatical and there can be abundance of them with little or no training... There is no way any country can produce as many highly-trained spec operators to match their numbers... nor is that a feasible solution...<br><br>Yes, it seems a workable solution seems to be isolating the brains (masterminds) from the arms (fanatical followers). To me, the solution seems to be two-pronged...<br>1) Hunt down the masterminds like what you said, but taking care not to make them matyrs...<br>2) making it less attractive for the followers to follow the mastermind.<br><br>However, there are some problems that still needs to be address...<br>a) it is not easy to isolate the mastermind from the followers if they're of the same community<br>b) It is not easy to track down the mastermind unless you have reliable eyes on the ground (HUMINT)<br>c) how to discredit the mastermind effectively without make him a matyr<br>d) understanding the motivation of the followers and providing attractive alternatives...<br><br>Anyone care to comment?</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>No threat from terrorists? You got to be mad!!!!<br><br>Attack plan on Singapore (OPS JIBRIL)== Extracted from : http://www.terrorismcentral.com/Library/terroristgroups/JemaahIslamiyah/JITerror/OpJIBRILAttackPlan.html<br><br>After the reconnaissance, al-Ghozie determined that they needed an additional 17 tons of ammonium nitrate. Six targets were selected for attack by suicide truck bombs weighing three tons each. [162] Fiah Musa member Ellias would secure the additional ammonium nitrate. Jabarah was supposed to bring in the technical expertise for the operations. Bomb makers would rig the vehicles in a secure warehouse. The local cell members would then leave the country before Jabarah brought in the suicide bombers. Jabarah planned to smuggle the suicide bombers into Singapore one day before the attack; just enough time to familiarize themselves with their route and target. [163]<br></div>

If he's carry a bomb, he'll show some form of body language.  However, if the owner is damn cool, study the openings of the bag closely.  If its set up by a pro, the opening device of the bag would most likely be trapped for anti-temperring.  If the bag is opened safely, heres a note to take, explosive device are not small objects unless its a dirty-bomb or chemical agent.  So be slow &amp; careful how you go about searching.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_confused.gif" alt="Confused" title="Confused"><br><br>Currently, Al Qaeda's OP is to strike at central city area where there are many people around.  They also like the ideal of using public transport from airplanes, trains to any vehicle that carrys a large number of the public.  There was a suicide bombing sometime back which involve a public bus in Israel.<br><br>For your 2nd question, take note as much detail of whatever the suspicious event maybe.  Every detail no matter how small can help investigators.  but do take note of your own personal safety 1st.  Don't be a hero.<br><br>Your final question, call the police, let them call whoever else that needs to be called.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>ANSWER TO POP QUIZ<br><br>i) Improvised Explosives look like anything from plasticine, plastic chips (TNT flakes), oil or any liquids, manure (ammonia nitrate), black pallets etc. Key to identify is the ignition device, usually has (i) power supply (batteries or connected to external source), (ii) wiring (forget "the red wire is correct one to cut" nonsense) and timing device (egg timer, watch etc).<br><br>ii) Vunerable spot, anywhere with lots of human traffic (MRT), difficult to by-pass (key junctions), most material damage or prestigious symbols (Stamford Raffles Statue, Merlion), sensatative facilities (Sattelite, water works etc). Think like a terrorist and you'd be suprized at the number of vunerable spots singapore has. Avoid the obvious and see the secondary ones which would cause just as much damage and less protected.<br><br>iii) Anything and everything<br><br>iv) Call 999 and pray the clown who appears is better trained than most others.<br><br>REMEMBER NEVER EVER TRY TO CHECK BY OPENING OR MOVING SUSPICIOUS OBJECT, especially if have oily stains, ticking sounds or even too odd shaped for usual.</div>
