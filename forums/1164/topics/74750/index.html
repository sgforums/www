            <div class='col-md body'>Yep, lion's got it spot-on. Sure, the physical training is demanding, but what's most important is mental endurance and determination. It'll be easy to get discouraged, but just remind yourself - don't. In the end, when you've put on your red beret, you'll know that it was all worth it.<br><br>Prepare yourself for a lot of tekaning as well. Although it seems that Hendon Camp is a far 'kinder and gentler' place than it was before, no commando training is complete without harassment - expect frequent turn-outs, heavy punishments for even minor faults, getting yelled and screamed at 24/7, sleep deprivation, etc. There's a certain amount of paranoia that you will have to live with, particularly in BMT and Basic Commando Training, but as long as you adopt a positive and optimistic attitude, you'll be able to cope with the stress.<br><br>Since you're going into PTP, try to work on those areas of the IPPT that you're weak in. Commando PTP is no fun, I had to go through it, too - but after a few weeks (three, I think, I can't remember exactly), they conduct an IPPT, and if you clear that, you'll be able to book out of camp and enjoy a brief holiday before BMT starts.<br><br>And yes, like lion says - at the end of the day, all suffering, no matter how great, will come to an end. Your first six months will be the toughest - BMT and BCT are full of harassment. Once you're past that, though, everything becomes a lot easier, so remember - just hang in there.<br><br>As for pre-enlistment training: like lion says, try to do quite a bit of running. I would also advise trying to put on some muscle mass in the gym. And work on those chin-ups!<br><br>Hope that's helpful. Welcome to the family, compadre - Honour and Glory unto thee.</div>

You will need to keep in mind that the aim of putting you through all of those conditions is to train you to function normally under any conditions.<br><br>To put it in context, your area of operations will be further forward than anyone else's, which means that your operations will be the hardest to support.  As such, you may expect that what you are deployed with will be all you will get for your mission, personnel included.<br><br>To complete your mission, regardless of loss of men and materials, you will need to be resourceful and organised - you have no resources to waste.  In order to be resourceful and organised, you will need to be focussed under all conditions and not let yourself get rattled by the circumstances.<br><br>The objective of your training is to get you accustomed to operating normally under the worst of conditions.  Keep this in mind and it will make the harrassment a little easier to bear.<br><br>lion, was that 32 or 35km at the end of BCT?
