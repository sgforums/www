A rough english translation, feel free to improve.<br><br>xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx<br><br>Article: Soon to be procured SPYDER missile system, upgrading our country's air defence capability<br>Lian He Zao Bao<br>19 Mar 2010<br>By Chai Yong Wei<br>New Missile system<br><br>Header: SPYDER is a low level, rapid response surface to air missile system, range 15 km and above, believed to replace a missile used by airforce for over 20 years, the 7 km ranged, UK built rapier missile.<br><br>Singapore has approached isreal to buy the SPYDER surface to air missile system, which in range or altitude will be better than the rapier, hence increasing air defence capability.<br><br>According to news by an american defence magazine last month, Singapore selected in 2009 the isreali company Rafael's spyder surface to air missile, and received an unknown number of missiles.<br><br>According to this paper's understanding, A MINDEF/SAF announcement is expected within this year.<br><br>SPYDER is a low level, rapid response surface to air missile system, range 15 km and above, believed to replace a missile used by airforce for over 20 years, the 7 km ranged, UK built rapier missile.<br><br>Rapier is used by 165 sqn, formed in 1983, and can shoot down targets within 3 km.<br><br>According to the rafael website, SPYDER missile system not only provides a fixed installation air defence capability, it also provides air defence for armoured forces, with all day, 360 degree defence capability, and no limitation on angle.<br><br>From target id until missile firing, reaction time is not more than 5 seconds, firing range from within 1 km to over 15km, firing altitude from 20 feet to 9000 feet. It has simultaneous targeting capability, firing single missile or multiple missiles.<br><br>SPYDER is the abbreviation of "Surface-to-air Python and Derby". Python and Derby represents the Python 5 and Derby missile, most special feature is that it (the system) uses 2 different types of missile. The Python 5 and Derby are Israel's latest air to air missiles, currently Israeli Air Force's core munition.<br><br>Python 5 is a agile capable short-ranged dogfight missile, Derby being a medium range air defence missile, which technology wise is a next generation air to air missile catagory. Israel has packaged them into the same weapons system., equipping into one SPYDER system with short and medium range capability, whilst having 2 separate systems. <br><br>Hence SPYDER missile system is cost-effective, providing upgraded air defence for a country with limited military budget. Besides short range air defence, SPYDER also provides medium ranged air defence<br><br>As it can cope with both short range and medium range air targets, it can shoot down both aircraft and other air vehicles, as well as UAVs, air dropped bombs and missiles, capability better than current air defence systems.<br><br>Singapore is small, having a dense population, with many tall buildings, if attacked, will suffer more greatly than a large country, hence great emphasis is placed on air defence, especially with America's example of 911 terrorists attacking by hijacking airliners and crashing them into ground targets, it makes one appreciate more the importance of air defence.<br><br>Besides Rapier, the air force in accordance with its differing environment needs and uses, operates 5 other types of air defence system, including the "improved hawk" (I-hawk), "needle" type (IGLA), RBS 70 type laser guidance, north wind type (Mistral) and oerlikon 35mm calibre gun.<br><br>Malaysia Defence Minister:<br><br>No need to worry or speculate<br><br>Singapore's actions of purchasing an air defence system has been read by some "people of intent" as an arms race between the two countries.<br><br>But the Malaysian defence minister in responding to local media queries, says the purchase of military equipment by a country is a normal affair, no need to worry or speculate. <br><br>He said, Malaysia is not worried by Singapore's military activites. He also emphasised, the defence relationship between the 2 countries is very good and often conducts joint military exercises.</p></div>

              <p>Bravo to the Malaysian Defense Minister for playing down the jingoistic efforts of the likes represented by the noisy pusssy - whose intent is to blow hot air unnecessarily - and create false and hollow worthless pride.</p>
              <p>Weapon systems purchased are not meant to be boastfully paraded but are meant to be placed in quiet preparedness, and mentioned calmly to provide confidence for economic and social conditions to be carried out in respectful and helpful ways that will be beneficial for the region.</p>
              <p>What is the use of having the mentality of a poison prawn all the time, when we need also to live amongst the big fishes and find a way forward to co-exist and progress in mutually beneficial ways ?</p>

              <p>The article in zaobao does not specifically say that the Derby version was purchased &amp; we cannot necessarily conclude that SAF has also acquired this SAM. </p>
