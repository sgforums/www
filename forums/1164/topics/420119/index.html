              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT">KOLKATA/CHITTARANJAN: A  <a href="http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/search?q=Gorkha%20Rifles%20jawan">Gorkha Rifles jawan</a> travelling on a train did not hesitate to take on a gang of 30 armed  <a href="http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/search?q=dacoits">dacoits</a> singlehandedly, armed with just a khukri, when he saw them looting his fellow passengers. A  <a href="http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/search?q=GRP">GRP</a> escort team posted on the train reportedly did nothing to stop the robbers on Maurya Express late on Thursday. <br><br> Nearly 30 armed dacoits looted cash and valuables worth `10 lakh from 
              passengers of Maurya Express between Kulti and Chittaranjan stations 
              along the West Bengal-Jharkhand border on Thursday night. <br><br> The 
              armed dacoits refused to mess with Vishnu Shresta when they came to know
               that he is a soldier, but the 45-year-old Gorkha Rifles jawan would not
               sit back and watch his fellow passengers being manhandled and looted. 
              The fearless Gurkha pulled out his  <a href="http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/search?q=khukri">khukri</a> and fell upon the dacoits till he was overpowered. After a hurried shot
               fired at him went astray, they used the same khukri to slash Shresta's 
              wrist. <br><br> Shresta is posted at Ranchi and was proceeding on leave to Pokhra in  <a href="http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Nepal">Nepal</a>.
               He boarded the Hatia-Gorakhpur Jn Maurya Express from Ranchi on 
              Thursday evening. When the raid took place, he was fast asleep on his 
              berth. <br><br> "Suddenly, there were shouts and the sound of running 
              feet," Shresta recounted from his bed at Kasturba Gandhi Hospital in 
              Chittaranjan. "Somebody pulled at my bedclothes. I sat up and found a 
              number of people standing near my feet. They demanded that I hand over 
              all my cash and valuables. There was confusion all around and I shouted 
              that I am an Indian Army jawan. The criminals backed off and turned 
              their attention to a woman and her child, who were on a berth close by,"
               Shresta added. <br><br> He lost his cool when he saw a miscreant trying
               to pull out the girl, about 8 years old, from the berth and snatch a 
              necklace from her mother. <br><br> "I am a soldier and get paid to 
              protect citizens of this country. I could not sit back and watch as 
              passengers were looted. I pulled out my khukri and attacked the 
              criminals. Initially, they were taken by surprise and I succeeded in 
              connecting with at least three of them. The blows were severe and they 
              must have got themselves admitted to some hospital. By then, the 
              criminals started fighting back. They fired a shot that missed me. At 
              one point of time, the khukri fell from my hand and I was overpowered. 
              They picked it up and used it on me," the jawan said. <br><br> After 
              Shresta slumped to the ground, profusely bleeding from his wound, all 
              fight went out from the other passengers. None of them dared to make eye
               contact with the criminals and did their bidding. <br><br> According to
               authorities, members of the gang were travelling on the train posing as
               passengers. Around 11.25pm, about 10 minutes after the train left Kulti
               station, the criminals detached the vacuum hose between two coaches. 
              This brought the train to a stop. While some dacoits entered S1, S2 and 
              S3 coaches, others smashed the windows of the A1 and B1 air-conditioned 
              compartments to gain entry. <br><br> "The miscreants were shouting in 
              Hindi. When they asked us to hand over all our valuables, I gave them my
               purse and cellphone," said Nilu Verma, who was on her way to Lakhisarai
               from Katras. Ajay Srivastava was walking back to his berth from the 
              toilet when he was accosted by the criminals. "One of them snatched my 
              cellphone and asked me to hand over my wallet. As I took some time to 
              react, he slapped me and snatched my belongings," said Srivastava, who 
              was going to Muzaffarpur. <br><br> Anita Modi, on her way to Barauni, 
              felt that the 15-20 minutes of terror would never come to an end. 
              "Passengers were beaten up and abused. Even women were not spared. 
              People were screaming but nobody came to our assistance. When the train 
              reached Chittaranjan, we were feeling ill," she said. <br><br> Shresta 
              said the criminals were in the late thirties and carrying various types 
              of weapons, including guns, daggers and tangis. Strangely, railway staff
               on the train said they were not aware that passengers had been robbed 
              till they reached Chittaranjan. "We shall discuss with the RPF and GRP 
              on how to provide security on night trains in this stretch," said G C 
              Roy, senior divisional commercial manager of Asansol. <br><br> Police 
              succeeded in arresting six of the criminals and recovered a part of the 
              booty later. A manhunt has been launched for the others. Asansol 
              divisional railway manager Jagadanand Jha claimed that there was a GRP 
              escort on the train, but the personnel did little to prevent the crime. <br><br></span></p>
