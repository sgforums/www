            <div class='col-md body'>INSIGHT: The Internet: The new political ward?<br>By Lydia Lim<br><br>A WEEK after a rather parsimonious Ministry of Defence statement said that a young soldier had 'collapsed' and died, someone put up an online posting offering a shocking explanation.<br><br>The person, also a national serviceman, alleged that Second Sergeant Hu Enhuai had died after being dunked in water. About five other people also nearly drowned during a combat survival training session, he claimed.<br><br><span style="color: red;">His posting on the Military Nuts forum at www.sgforums.com sparked an online discussion that drew thousands of page views.</span> <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"><br>Some others, who said they were commandos, also posted messages confirming that water torture had been part of training sessions for some time.<br><br>This thread, which began in late August, was later removed by one of the forum's moderators.<br><br>Still, about two months later, Defence Minister Teo Chee Hean told Parliament that 2nd Sgt Hu had indeed died from drowning during the dunking, an unauthorised training practice at the School of Commando Training.<br><br>His friend, speaking for the first time to the press, tells Insight that he started the discussion thread to counter any wrong impression created by the first Mindef statement.<br><br>'They claimed that he had collapsed during training, as if it was due to his own health problems. There was no mention that he had drowned.<br><br>'I felt it was an injustice and decided to post an account of what really happened online, to let as many people as possible know,' he says. 'I let them know he drowned, that his head was forced under water and held there for a long time.'<br><br>This person, who asked not to be named, says he based his account on a conversation he had with another NSman who was at the scene.<br><br>After that first posting, he says he watched and waited to see what Mindef would do.<br><br>'I was just hoping that they would come out with the truth and admit that it was negligence on their part,' he says.<br><br>He still remembers Oct 15, the day Rear-Admiral (NS) Teo spoke for the first time about his friend's death.<br><br>'When I heard the minister's statement, I felt happiness and relief that his death had not been in vain, that there would be steps taken to prevent other people from dying in the same way.'<br><br>OUTING THE TRUTH<br><br>HOW the online discussion figured in Mindef's decision to make public the cause of 2nd Sgt Hu's death is difficult to establish.<br><br>The closest the Government came to acknowledging the Internet as a factor was on Oct 19, when Deputy Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong told reporters that Mindef would be transparent.<br><br>'Nobody should be left in any doubt that there is a cover-up or that Mindef will be kind to its own people... If we did not tell the truth, then people will start believing what is on the Internet uncritically,' he said.<br><br>What is clear is that, this time round, Mindef has been far more open than it was in 1991, when it also faced public pressure to be more forthcoming about three accidents that left eight servicemen dead.<br><br>At that time, Member of Parliament Charles Chong had asked for more information on the cases.<br><br>But then Second Minister for Defence Yeo Ning Hong said legal and security reasons required that findings by committees set up to investigate military accidents had to be kept secret.<br><br>Insight asked Rear- Adm (NS) Teo about the difference in Mindef's response then and now, and whether the Internet was a factor.<br><br>He would say only that his ministry's 'open approach' this time round 'ensures that the high level of public support and trust in the SAF is maintained'.<br><br>He also said in his e-mail reply that Mindef seeks feedback and monitors views from both soldiers and the public because the SAF is a 'citizen's army'.<br><br>It is interested in all 'serious discussions', regardless of the medium. And it responds when an issue 'merits a response', he added.<br><br><span style="color: red;">Although the Government may not like to admit it, the Internet has definitely limited its ability to suppress information, say media watchers.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br>As Mr Arun Mahizhnan, deputy director of the Institute of Policy Studies, notes: 'When serious issues are outed in the Internet first, the Government would find it exceedingly difficult to completely cover up.'  </span><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br></div>
