You will ses symptoms like nausea, vomiting or blank staring after the baptism of fire. It is said that those symptom are normal and only small percentage  of soldier cant recover at all and goes sect 8.<br><br>there is no doubt (if the soldier are well trained) that those same soldier that vomiting will become great officers and soldier.<br><br>my concern is the officers. SAF officers, how would you think they will conduct under fire? what happen when all the gadget that SAF officers and soldier rely on suddenly down? does that hamper the innitiative? [/code]</div>
