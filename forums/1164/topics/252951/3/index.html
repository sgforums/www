            </div>
            <div class='col-md body'>I believe the weakness of SAF is due to mainly 2 glaring issues which is namely elitism and doctrine.<br><br>Elitism, is very evident in all sectors of SAF. For example when a major exercise is conducted and concluded, senior commanders are rewarded with a big feast. That time during Wallaby, when the brigade exercise has ended, all the officers were entitled to this feast with flowing red wine, fine seafood dining on expensive cutleries under white tents with compliments of music from the PA system. How abt the rest, the NCO and men? We get to only eye-power their food and we have to buy our own food from the canteen. These creates an environment of elitism as officers are perceived as a rich men, privileged club. Such treatment will only dampen the morale of the troops under their direct command and create general un-happiness. These preferential treatment will only further encourage scholar-general syndrome and attract soldiers that are interested not by the nature of the job but by how lavish and spoilt the life an officer leads. Allowing retired generals to head GIC/ GLC or join the men in white has bred a generation of generals motivated by wealth and lust for future power in the civilian world.<br><br>The second problem is doctrines. We are the classic products of our rigid, stiff and too orthodox education system. Most of our exercises are too typical and hardly deviate from the typical setup. For example, we tend to assume the enemies will fight this way, use his equipment this way, or his modus operandi is this way. Thus our exercise dun really push the commanders to think of possible contigencies or alternative fighting manuveurs. Our exercises also always assume the enemy has an overall lower firepower or are lower technology than us.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Elitsm? Hard to say but I would not be surprised to find that in Singapore.<br><br>HOWEVER, there needs to be some seperation between the officers and men, as discovered in studies, hence the ritual and stuff that tends to set them apart from the Non Commisioned ranks. Some degree of seperation is needed to make sure the officers can give orders that they might be reluctant to give if they associated too closely to the men (such as sending them to their certain deaths).<br><br>But of course this works both ways. Too close to the men and you stop thinking like a commander, too far away and you become aloof and lose the enlisted men's respect.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>The way i see it, we have at least 3 potential weakness that can be exploited by our enemies:<br>1. We are largely untested (I'm referring to brigade and above level). We can plan, simulate and exercise all we want, but our forces are largely untested in combat (pls correct me if I'm wrong - East Timor is so far our largest combat deployment, right?) such as: (a) how to respond when things go wrong, (b) can various units co-ordinate under stress or when things don't go according to plan or training etc.<br>2. Staying power. How long can we stay and persevere? Most of our exercises are over in a few days. And given our doctrine is pre-emptive in nature, we will probably not be fighting on S'porean soil (less motivation to continue fighting?). Also, whether we have enough stockpiles of petrol, water, food, combat and medical supplies if the war becomes prolonged, like US is in Iraq?<br>3. Can we adapt? True, our weaponry mostly outclasses our oponents', but they may come up with new tactics (e.g., guerilla warfare), new devices (e.g., shaped-charge IEDs that can penetrate even Chobam armour). Can we adapt to different scenarios, different type of warfare?<br>(edited later)</div>
