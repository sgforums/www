Please elaborate.</div></blockquote>I think Tim Huxley pointed this out, we have this issue where it seems that some of the people in our higher levels of command are not really warriors at heart, but simply farming cash and a scholarship and see the SAF scholarship plan as a nice way to get it.<br><br>How to fix it? That would involve breaking a lot of iron rice bowls and transforming the SAF into an army that rewards true initiative (and not just wayang) rather then keep status quos and impress the latest visiting minister as well as filling endless forms.<br><br>It would mean giving the NCOs and CSMs a lot more freedom and leeway in how they run their show, as well as giving more weight to their feedback on what is happening on the ground.<br><br>But most importantly I think the mark of a general should be if he has the heart of a warrior, and not if he can manage to ace his studies or what have you not. Not that our generals do not need to be intelligent, but the emphasis ought to be more on a pratical intelligence then what is tested on how well you can mug your books.<br></div>
