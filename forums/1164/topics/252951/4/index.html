Ofcourse sweeping hostile narrow straits werent easy, your ship were within range of many type of missile and artillery (South african have proven that their G5 can be use to attack ship)<br><br>4. Now you have to secure the entire lenght of the coast line so that the flotilla will be secure while sweeping the straits for the bogus mines.<br><br>5. By the time the navy realise that the mines were probably bogus, its probably too late because the time consumed to search for it and the diverting of forces to secure the coastline have bogg down the actual campaign (which is the objective of the enemy forces)<br><br>6. when this happen and the flotilla retreats, all the enemy need to do is blow a ship using a mine some where in the straits, so that the first impression that the mines were bogus, will be crushed and more units will be diverted to secure this part of the peninsular....and for surely the attrition warfare will start.<br><br>given that the sealane is closed..and not the entire lenght of the straits is secure, the straits will be closed for a very long time and marking an economic disaster for singapore.<br><br>Now it is not necessarily the north that did the fiasco... country like Thai who for all these years wanted the segenting kra canal to be opened and killing singapore port at the same times...or the indonesia who can revive its super ports potential.. from the closure of singapore ports.<br><br>but this is just hypothesis. lol<br><br></div></blockquote>well... first of all... even the claim of mines being layed in malacca by them would get them straight away into hot soup with all the major global powers.. you dont even have to lay them... and those embassadors would be crashing into their PM office with a bulldozer.<br><br>secondly... without choking off the other ways of passage to singapore such as from the eastern and southern approach, mining the malacca is pure stupidity as it only renders their own major ports on their west coast inoperable.<br><br>thirdly... we dont have to secure the entire malacca straight... the US and other regional powers navy will do that for us... and i sure as hell will pay big bucks to see them hit or sink an american carrier with their G-5...  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br></div>
