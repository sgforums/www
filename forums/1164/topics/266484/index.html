            <div class='col-md body'>The Expeditionary Fighting Vehicle (EFV) is the newest USMC amphibious vehicle, intended for deployment in 2015. It was renamed from the Advanced Amphibious Assault Vehicle in late 2003.<br><br>The designed is an amphibious armored personnel carrier; launched at sea, from an amphibious assault ship beyond the horizon, able to transport a full Marine rifle squad to shore. It will maneuver cross country with an agility and mobility equal to or greater than the M1 Abrams.<br><br>The EFV is designed to replace the aging AAV, and is the Marine Corps' number one priority ground weapon system acquisition. It has three times the speed in water and about twice the armor of the AAV, and superior firepower as well.<br><br>Design:<br><br>The General Dynamics Land Systems EFV is an amphibious armored tracked vehicle with an aluminum hull. The engine is a custom MTU Friedrichshafen diesel (MT883) with two modes of operation; a high power mode for planing over the sea, and a low power mode for land travel.<br><br>The hull has a hydraulically actuated bow flap to aid planing. Shrouded Honeywell waterjet propulsors are integrated into each side of the hull and hydraulically actuated chines cover the tracks while in seafaring mode.<br><br>The aluminum hull has caused some controversy due to protection and flammability concerns. It is vulnerable to most armor piercing weapons and ignited aluminum produces toxic fumes. However, aluminum hulls have been used for decades in military ground vehicles and boats. The rear loading ramp is not able to open while the vehicle is afloat. This is also typical of other swimming military ground vehicles. For example, the M113 is another armored military ground vehicle the US currently is using that swims. It also has an aluminum hull, and its rear ramp cannot open while the vehicle is afloat.<br><br>It has a crew of three and can transport 17 Marines and their equipment.<br><br>There is a Command Platform version with secure command and control electronics (and seven work stations), but lacking the 30 mm cannon.<br><br>It is fitted with composite armor, mine-blast protection, and a nuclear, biological and chemical defense system (NBC). The standard version also has a Bushmaster II 30 mm Cannon.<br><br>Features:<br><br>7.62 mm Machine Gun (1xcoaxial)<br>Smoke / Gas Dispensers (32x)<br>Rear Troop Hatch<br>Top Troop Hatches (2x)<br>Reinforced Crew Compartment<br><br>Still under testing in the prototype stage though... Looks pretty ugly to me.<br><br><a href="http://youtube.com/watch?v=abWIjfFa26s" rel="nofollow">http://youtube.com/watch?v=abWIjfFa26s</a><br>Featured in Mail Call<br><br><img src="http://img504.imageshack.us/img504/7727/expeditionaryfightingvedg0.jpg"><br><br><img src="http://img168.imageshack.us/img168/2538/efvhydroplaningve8.jpg"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>The Philippines still uses a version of these AAVP7. They are about the size of a SBS bus.<br><br>I don't think any one thing can ever be good at doing 2 jobs equally well - swim to shore, then operate on land.<br><br>In the end, they don't do well at either. They are slow and unstable in the water and on land they are one big fat thinly armoured target. They can't be too well-armoured as they weren't designed to float.<br><br>Many tanks drowned in Normandy before they got to the beach.<br><br>A boat on the other hand, is designed to float first, so you can put more armour on a boat and it will still be faster and more capable on water than a lightly armoured amphibious tank.<br><br>So this is a fast sea-going vehicle, heavily-armoured like a Merkava, and once on land this boat will have some land capabilities - Just enough for it to rule the beach. But not so much that it compromises its boat concept hull.<br><br>Some of these vehicles will be weapon platforms while others will carry troops.<br><br>After the beach is secured their job is done. You don't need them to go on fighting inland as you can land all the tanks and MBTs you have after you've secured the beach.<br><br>The hovercraft comes very close to what I am describing - agile and fast at sea. But how good is it on land? Does the thing goes deflated if the air cusion is shot out?</div>
