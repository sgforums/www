              <p style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify">In their report, they specifically asked the agency to probe the alleged involvement of Deputy Prime Minister Najib Abdul Razak in the deal.</p>
              <p style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify">The report was lodged by Shamsul Iskandar (PKR Youth), Sapky Yusof (PAS Youth) and Anthony Loke (DAP Youth). The trio were accompanied by several supporters.</p>

              <p style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify">Zahar also accused Najib of providing Prime Minister Abdullah Ahmad Badawi, who took over the defence portfolio on Sept 17, with an “inaccurate” report pertaining to the contract.</p>

              <p> PUTRAJAYA, Oct 24 - The Pakatan Rakyat Youth wings today lodged a report at the Anti-Corruption Agency (ACA) headquarters here against Deputy Prime Minister Datuk Seri Najib Razak for alleged involvement in the RM2.3 billion Eurocopter helicopter deal.</p>
              <p>"We want them to open an investigation against Najib," said PKR Youth chief Shamsul Iskandar who led the group which included DAP Youth secretary Anthony Loke and Pas Youth secretary Ahmad Sabki Yusuf.</p>
              <p>The three representatives said they submitted several documents to assist the ACA, including a research paper over a similar purchase for the military helicopters by Brazil but for a significantly reduced sum.</p>
              <p><strong><span style="color: #0000ff;">Malaysia is reported to have signed a letter of intent to acquire <span style="text-decoration: underline;">12 Eurocopter</span> EC727 Cougar helicopters for a sum of <span style="text-decoration: underline;">RM2.3 billion</span> while <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Brazil paid US$1.2 billion for 50 units of the same model.</span></span></strong></p>
              <p>The PR Youth want the ACA to mount an investigation over the price discrepancy in two Eurocopter deals as well as to investigate a letter of intent regarding another complaint letter purportedly sent by one Datuk Zahar Hashim, the chairman of Mentari Services Sdn Bhd which is the local representative for a Russian helicopter company.</p>
              <p>In his letter, Zahar, a retired airforce captain, had claimed that Eurocopter had been awarded the contract to replace the ageing Nuri fleet even though it was the most expensive bid among the companies which tendered for the contract.</p>
              <p>According to Loke, they were the first group to lodge an official complaint against the DPM over this particular matter even though the Public Accounts Committee (PAC) in Parliament had spoken about the issue recently.</p>
              <p>"PAC is only a security filter with no investigative power. The most suitable body to undertake this investigation is the ACA," said Loke, who is also the MP for Rasah.</p>
              <p>Shamsul added that the onus is now on ACA to take action.</p>
              <p>"We told them to be proactive. There is no reason for the ACA not to open an investigation," he said.</p>
              <p>Shamsul also called on Prime Minister Datuk Seri Abdullah Badawi to live up to his promise to implement his promised reforms, particularly in dealing with corruption, before he leaves office in March next year.</p>

              <div class="post-body entry-content"><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_TV9Tv4BCYuk/SPa-77gJmzI/AAAAAAAAAEA/1wLQ98OVfxA/s1600-h/eurocopter_ec725.bmp"><img id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5257599551795731250" style="display: block; margin: 0px auto 10px; cursor: hand; text-align: center;" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_TV9Tv4BCYuk/SPa-77gJmzI/AAAAAAAAAEA/1wLQ98OVfxA/s320/eurocopter_ec725.bmp" border="0" alt=""></a><br>
              <div>A retired Armed Forces Captain, Datuk Zahar Hashim claims there were discrepancies in the tender process which led to French-German aviation firm, Eurocopter, winning the bid to supply the Royal Malaysian Air Force (RMAF) with 12 Cougar EC725 long-range tactical transport helicopters to replace the aging Nuri helicopters. The new Cougar choppers will cost the government an estimated RM2.3 billion.</div>
              <br>
              <div>As a military aviation enthusiast, I have been following the progress of the government's intention to replace the aging Nuri choppers with great interest, hoping that the folks at the Ministry of Defence (Mindef) would make a good choice for RMAF's long term use. I was quite happy when the government announced it has made a decision to purchase the Cougars, outbidding 3 other short-listed contenders - the American-made Sikorsky S92; the EH-101 (AW-101) Merlin of British-Italian firm Agusta Westland; and Russia's Mil Mi-17 Hip manufactured by Kazan Helicopters (under license from Mil Moscow Helicopter Plant which is the original manufacturer). I had always anticipated that it was either going to be the Cougar, Sikorsky or the Merlin, based on RMAF's requirement for a long-range versatile chopper with high capability for troop transportation and Combat Search and Rescue (CSAR). The Mil Mi-17 on the other hand, is more popular among Eastern bloc nations, with slightly older technology and less options / compatibility to be fitted with current state-of-the-art avionics and eletronic warfare systems.</div>
              <br>
              <div>To me, Zahar's two letters dated Oct 7 and 9, addressed to Deputy Prime Minister and former Defence Minister, Datuk Seri Najib Tun Razak (also copied to the Prime Minister's Office, the Anti-Corruption Agency (ACA), the Public Accounts Committee and the Public Complaints Bureau) is a classic case of being a sourgrape. Obviously angry because his company Mentari Services Sdn Bhd who represented Kelowna Flightcraft of Canada (for Kazan Helicopters) lost the bid, he is now out to get Najib and those at Mindef, hoping to get full support from the Prime Minister, the ACA and the Member of Parliaments in the PAC.</div>
              <br>
              <div>I feel sad because a sore loser is attempting to screw up the purchase of a helicopter with a proven track record, both during peace and war times. Of course good things come at a price. Here's a simple analogy. Why do people spend a bomb to buy Mercedes Benz or BMW when they can get a Japanese, Korean or even Malaysian marque for a quarter of the price they originally paid for the mentioned German marques? Well, obviously the Benz or the Beemer offers something beyond what Malaysian-made vehicles has - be it performance, ride, handling, safety and other creature comforts, not to the mention state-of-the art features and other options.</div>
              <br>
              <div>Okay, let's look at another analogy which favours Malaysian-made cars, just to be fair. Let's talk about Russian-made cars. Would you rather be seen in a box-like Lada or the sleek Proton Gen-2? Common sense would tell you, of course the latter which is definitely sexier and ages apart in terms of technology from every aspect. The fact remains until today that Russian made cars such as Lada, Gaz, Moskyith and Iz are poorly designed and highly questionable in terms of reliability. But one thing is for sure, they are bloody cheap.</div>
              <br>
              <div>Which brings us to the Russian-made Mil Mi-17 Hip chopper, rejected by Mindef in favour of the Cougar. First and foremost, Zahar's company Mentari Services is obviously several layers down from the chopper's original parent company back in Russia. It is quite baffling when Zahar claimed his company is representing Kelowna Flightcraft of Canada, which is in fact merely an aviation Maintenance, Repair and Overhaul (MRO) company in British Columbia which I suspect is the marketing agent for Kazan helicopters in Canada. Even if Mindef decided to choose the Mil Mi-17 choppers, it would be much cheaper for the government to deal direct with Kazan Helicopters or better still, Mil Moscow Helicopter Plant in Russia. Why even the need to deal with Mentari Services which obviously would charge hefty commissions and other hidden / discreet charges anyway? The Malayian government already have a good relationship with the Russian government, having purchased the MIG-29N and Sukhoi MKM-30 air superiority fighters under direct negotiations with the sole Russian government defence-related exporting arm, Rosoboronexport. In fact, the purchase of Mil Mi-17 would have had to be made through Rosobornexport which handles all sales of Russian arms to the international market.</div>
              <br>
              <div>Zahar also claims that the government could have save RM1.5 billion by opting for the Mil Mi-17 instead of the Cougar. He said that the government could have bought 30 units of the Mil Mi-17 for the amount paid to Eurocopter for the 12 Cougars. This is a clear cut case of quantity versus quality. We have lost too many airmen already each time a Nuri crashes. Will Zahar will be responsible for more lives if the Mil Mi-17 malfunctions mid-air?</div>
              <br>
              <div>Although I welcome the ACA and PAC's move to probe the Eurocopter deal, I hope the investigations would be done professionally and objectively with inputs and feedbacks from those who are experts in military aviation - the RMAF especially must play a pivotal role in defending their selection for the Cougars during the inquiry. When it comes to selecting the Nuri replacements, there should be no compromise for quality and safety. The MPs in the PAC especially, should not use this issue for political mileage. The business of defending our country's sovereignty via land, sea or air is no joke. It comes with a price. Just look at the defence budget for our southern neighbour and we'll know why. The last thing we want is Malaysia once again being the laughing stock for poor selection of defence equipments and arms. For this matter, the Opposition or potential opportunitist itching to capitalise on this issue for their own mileage should just shut up and leave it to our capable people at Mindef to handle this because it is their business to ensure the country is safe, with the aid of good defence capabilities. And don't even think of using the "waste of taxpayers' money" card for this one. As a taxpayer myself, I want my money to be spent on good defence equipment. I don't want my money to be associated with mediocre defence technology...</div>

              <h1 id="story_title">Eurocopter deal deferred (updated)</h1>
              <h2 id="story_byline">By ZULKIFLI ABD RAHMAN</h2>
              <div id="story_content"><br>
              <p>KUALA LUMPUR: The purchase of the Cougar EC 725 helicopters from <a href="http://archives.thestar.com.my/last365days/default.aspx?query=eurocopter"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0000ff;">Eurocopter</span></span></a> to replace the ageing RMAF Nuri helicopters has been deferred until the country’s economy improves, Datuk Seri Abdullah Ahmad Badawi said.</p>
              <p>The Prime Minister, who is also the Defence Minister, clarified that the cost of the purchase was RM1.7bil. He said the allocation would instead be channelled to other public programmes which provided high trickle-down benefits to the people.</p>
              <p>“For the time being, it’s more important to save because we are facing an economic situation connected to the global financial crisis,” he added.</p>
              <p>The decision, Abdullah said, was made during the Economic Council exco meeting on Oct 13, when the Economic Planning Unit had been directed to restructure the financial allocations for projects implemented under the Ninth Malaysia Plan for all ministries.</p>
              <p>“The ministries have been asked to reduce expenses,” he added.</p>
              <p>Abdullah said the affected projects were those which didn’t provide high trickle-down multiplier effects to the people, and the Eurocopter purchase is among the projects which would be postponed or cancelled.</p>
              <p>“We will not purchase the helicopters at this time. We need to reallocate our budget for certain specific programmes that need to be implemented in light of the present financial crisis.</p>
              <p>“We need money, but we cannot be borrowing to have money.</p>
              <p>“If we feel that some projects need to be postponed, we will decide accordingly,” he told a press conference Tuesday after hosting a Hari Raya and Deepavali open house at the Defence Ministry.</p>
              <p>Abdullah said the purchase of the Cougar would be reactivated once the national economy improved.</p>
              <p>“We have to decide by 2011 to buy new helicopters, and we may buy earlier if we have the money or we may buy fewer units than what we require,” he added.</p>
              <p>On the Nuri helicopters, Abdullah said the RMAF now has 28 units, which he said were old and had been involved in accidents which had cost the lives of soldiers and civilians.</p>
              <p>“We have to make sure we continue to service these helicopters as best we can.</p>
              <p>“We also have to realise that the time will also come when we need to buy new helicopters.</p>
              <p>“The decision has to be made by 2011, therefore it’s important these old helicopters be phased out,” he said, adding that it would take three years for the manufacturer to deliver the new helicopters.</p>
              <p>Abdullah said he would let the officials decide whether a new tender be called for the helicopters.</p>
              <p>Asked on the consequences of breaching the Letter of Intent (LOI) which already had been issued to Eurocopter, Abdullah said the Government can still postpone the project and no compensation payment would be involved.</p>
              <p>He added that he had not informed anyone, including Eurocopter or the French Government, of the postponement.</p>
              <p>Abdullah also said the Public Accounts Committee (PAC) would still go ahead with its scrutiny of the purchase of the Cougar helicopters.</p>
              <p>Abdullah said the PAC should be allowed to find our more details on the project.</p>
              <p>“That meeting was decided by the Deputy Prime Minister. Let the PAC know what procedures were involved and why the price was high.</p>
              <p>“The helicopters are expensive because of their high specifications.</p>
              <p>“The Cougar is designed to provide multiple functions such as combat search and rescue (CSAR) and troop carrying capabilities.</p>
              <p>“These are not ordinary helicopters that we can buy cheaply anywhere,” he added.</p>
              <p>Abdullah said he didn’t believe there were irregularities in the project, which was confirmed during the tenure of the previous Defence Minister, Datuk Seri Najib Tun Razak.</p>
              <p>On allegations that another company had offered lower prices and that the Brazil Government had bought lower-priced helicopters, Abdullah said:</p>
              <p>“The specifications involved would make them cost more.</p>
              <p>“The Brazilian version was not fixed to the level (of specifications) that we required.</p>
              <p>“If these helicopters are only for transport, of course they will cost much less,” he said.</p>
              <p>On the airworthiness of the Nuri helicopters, Abdullah said if the helicopters could be flown, then they are airworthy.</p>
              <p>Abdullah said he didn’t think that the postponement of the purchase and the reallocation of the budget meant that the country was going into recession.</p>
              </div>
              <p>“But when he have certain situations, we need to concentrate on projects that will have a multiplier effect on the people,” he added.</p>

              Ironic that the SP had higher fuel consumption as well.
              
              The extra cost is partly due to the additional avionics and self protection systems in the helo. The cost @ US$4X is about the same as the UH-60.

              <p>Taipei - Malaysia has canceled the procurement of 12 Eurocopter EC725 Cougar medium-lift transport helicopters to replace its aging Sikorsky S-61A4 Nuri helicopters.</p>
              <p>Malaysia's Air Force has been struggling to replace its remaining 30 Nuris, which were procured during the 1960s and '70s. Plans called for phasing out the Nuri by 2012.</p>

              <p>On Sept. 26, Prime Minister Abdullah Ahmad Badawi, also the countyr's defense minister, announced that a letter of intent had been signed with Eurocopter Malaysia to buy 12 EC725 helicopters for $650 million.</p>
              <p>The EC725 beat the AgustaWestland EH101, Boeing CH-47F, Kazan Mil Mi-17 and Sikorsky H-92 in a tender issued during the Langkawi International Maritime and Air Show (LIMA) last December.</p>
              <p>Abdullah announced the cancellation of the Eurocopter deal Oct. 28, citing the growing economic crisis and lost oil revenues.</p>
              <p>"We had decided during the National Economic Council meeting on Oct. 13 not to purchase the helicopters at the moment because we need the allocation for other projects, and saving is very important for us now to face an economic situation caused by the world economic crisis," Abdullah said in a news release.</p>
              <p>Political opposition leaders have attacked the Eurocopter deal as lacking transparency and protections. The Public Accounts Committee (PAC) and Anti-Corruption Agency are investigating allegations of corruption in the deal.</p>
              <p>"Most of the current controversy was due to the lack of public relations," a Malaysian defense analyst said. "They [MINDEF] could have avoided the bad press if they had done their homework. They could have explained better the decision behind the selection of the Cougar.</p>
              <p>"Furthermore, defense procurement policies inherited from the previous administration lacked transparency and checks, which will allow endless speculation and conspiracy theories," he said. "With the current political hangover, anything and everything will be politicized of which the current government yet again failed to appreciate. In the end, the services suffer."</p>
              <p>The analyst noted that there were also calls to shelve the deal in view of the current global economic crisis.</p>
              <p>Not everyone is convinced the deal is dead. One defense industry source in Malaysia said the "deal is still on" and the Malaysian "government is just going through a process of getting the ACA and PAC to issue reports saying all was fair and no corruption involved.</p>
              <p>"These reports will be issued soon, allowing the government to quash all the speculation and allowing the contract to be signed," he said.</p>

In fact the Nuri could last very long as evidence in service by Germany, Denmark, Canada, UK - Westland Commando, India. All these nation do periodic upgrade &amp; refurbishment on this old machine which Malaysia forgot after first 10 years or so, it start dropping from the sky. Then the flight instrument upgrade with a radar and stop again, as not enough finance for a full upgrade. Latest upgrade was with Airod then the ho ha about buying came to show and I think the upgrade just not there anymore. So how can this machine last.</p></div>
