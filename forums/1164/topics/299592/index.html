            <div class='col-md body'>Well, a quite interesting development, with the Russian modern 3G air defense, at least Persians can effectively deter any possible long range air raid by Jews. You have to figure out Polar bears are smart ones, they are equipping Iran with modern air defense system and fighter jets. It seems Iran has approached China for possible J10 sale but so far Chinese official media denies such sale.  If Israelis want a strike, they have to face formidable integrated air defense made up of modern SAMs like S-300 &amp; Tor-1, in the air, they may face Su30s. If Russians continue arming Iran in such a way, it may only leave any air strike option to Yanks, So, Yanks have to worry about IranÂ’s C802s that overseeing the narrow waterway, probably could remind them of the Silkworm that made Yanks so headache in 1980s.<br><br><blockquote><br><a href="http://news.yahoo.com/s/afp/20071226/wl_mideast_afp/iranrussiamilitarydefence_071226125812" rel="nofollow"><strong>Iran says Russia to supply new air defence system</strong></a><br><br>by Stuart Williams Wed Dec 26, 7:58 AM ET<br>TEHRAN (AFP) - Iran announced on Wednesday it is to receive S-300 air missile defence systems from Russia, a move that risks angering the United States which has been critical of past arms sales to Tehran.<br><br>The S-300 system will be delivered to Iran within the framework of a contract agreed in the past," Iranian Defence Minister Mostafa Mohammad Najjar was quoted as saying by state radio, without giving the date of the contract.<br>"The timing of the delivery will be announced at a later date," he added.<br>Earlier this year Moscow frustrated Washington by delivering to Tehran 29 TOR-M1 air defence missile systems, in a deal estimated to be worth 700 million dollars.<br><br>Iranian state media touted the S-300 as an even more sophisticated system than the TOR-M1, saying it could hit incoming enemy targets at a greater altitude. Iran said in January it had successfully test fired the TOR-M1.<br>The United States had urged Russia to cancel that sale, saying it was a mistake when the UN Security Council had imposed sanctions on Iran's ballistic missile industry as part of measures against its nuclear drive.<br>There was no immediate official confirmation of the new delivery from Russia, but the Interfax news agency quoted a senior Russian defence source as saying Iran would receive several dozen of the systems.<br><br>"In line with the contract signed several years ago, Russia will deliver to Iran several dozen 3RS S-300PMU1 anti-aircraft systems," the source said. Interfax said the deliveries would begin next year.<br><br>Russia, a veto-wielding permanent UN Security Council member, has important economic interests in Tehran.<br><br>A Russian contractor is also building and supplying fuel for Iran's first nuclear power station in the southern city of Bushehr, a much delayed project expected to be ready next year.<br><br>Moscow approved the two UN Security Council resolutions imposing sanctions against Tehran over the nuclear crisis, but also succeeded in watering down the measures and has been lukewarm on US efforts for a third.<br>Nevertheless, Russia has strongly urged Iran to obey the main demand of the West in the nuclear standoff -- that it suspends sensitive uranium enrichment activities.<br><br>Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said Russia was actively working to persuade Iran to suspend enrichment, offering Tehran the prospect of full negotiations with world powers if it did.<br><br>"From the economic point of view, Iran has no need to continue its programme of enriching uranium," he told the Vremya Novosti newspaper.<br>"We are trying to persuade the Iranians that Iran would benefit by suspending its programme, as this would immediately mean negotiations with the six (world powers dealing with the crisis) including the United States."<br>Iran's announcement of the delivery of the surface-to-air S-300 defence system comes amid continued international tensions over the Iranian nuclear programme, which the West fears could be used to make nuclear weapons.<br>The United States has never ruled out military action to end Iran's defiance, although a US intelligence report published earlier this month appears to have momentarily taken the heat out of the standoff.<br><br>The report said Tehran had halted a nuclear weapons programme in 2003, undermining US President George W. Bush's claims that it had an active atomic bomb drive. Iran denied ever seeking atomic weapons.<br><br>Iranian officials have vowed never to initiate any attack but have warned the armed forces will strike back with crushing force if the country's territory is hit.</blockquote></div>

The US have yet to field any similar operational systems.

This will be RussiaÂ’s second major contract with Iran on air defense systems in the recent years. Analysts say that Russia is thus countering plans of the United States for military interventions in the Middle East. </strong><br>Iranian Defense Minister Mostafa Mohammad Najjar said on Wednesday that the contract with Russia would deliver to Iran S-300 systems under a timetable to be announced soon. Russian arms trader Rosoboronexport and contractÂ’s executor Antey-Almaz did not comment on the statement but did not refute it either. Sources of Kommersant said that Russia has agreed to sell to Iran five S-300PMU-1 complexes worth $800 million. A source in the military industry reported that the contract had not been signed yet but talks were in a final stage. He, however, said that S-300PMU-1 might as well be sold to Iran from the arsenal of the Russian armed forces after necessary updates.<br><br>Teheran hosted last week a session of the Russian-Iranian intergovernmental commission on military and technical cooperation where Mikhail Dmitriev, head of the Federal Military and Technical Cooperation Service, made it clear that Russia was set to carry on cooperating with Iran in this field and added that this was necessary to preserve balance of forces in the region.<br><br>Contacts between Russia and Iran in military and technical cooperation got a major boost in early 2004 when Teheran asked MoscowÂ’s help in creating a missile defense system. <strong>Moscow suggested using S-300PMU-1 systems for defense of the capital city and four other regions including industrial center Isfahan, main naval base in Bander Abbas (the Persian Gulf), the nuclear plant in Bushehr and oil terminals in Abadan and Khorramshar.</strong><br><br>Iran was earlier in talks to buy an S-300V top tier army air defense system. Belarus, which also has the series in its arsenal, was to supply them to from Russia a new S-300PMU-2 system in return. But this option was no longer under consideration as relations between Moscow and Minsk got sour early this year.<br><br>In December 2005 Russia and Iran struck a deal to sell 29 Tor-M1 complexes for $700 million which was to act as a shield for S-300 systems. The Kommersant source in the Russian military industry said that Â“selling Tors first Moscow thought to check the worldÂ’s reaction to the contractÂ”.<br><br>The deal to deliver to Tehran five divisions of S-300PMU-1 was to be signed in March 2006. But Moscow walked out of the talks in January 2006 to protest TehranÂ’s course on its nuclear program. Russia was hoping to sell these S-300PMU-1 complexes to Algeria. But a recent chill in Russia-Algerian relations froze the execution of the contract. So, Iran is now most likely to get these systems after all.<br><br>The sale of S-300PMU-1 to Iran will surely create new tensions between Russia and the United States. Washington was quite cool in its reaction to MoscowÂ’s delivery of Tor-M1 complexes to Tehran as the engagement range of these missiles is limited to 12km and up to altitudes of 6km. They could strike cruise missiles or controlled air bombs but not the jets themselves. To strike Tors the United States would just need fire more missiles or bombs at the target. However, the range of S-300PMU-1 reaches 300km with altitudes of up to 27km. They could make American fighters and bombers easy targets. Back in 1998 the United States supported Turkey in its protest against the Russian contract to deliver S-300PMU-1 systems to the island. Cyprus ended up buying Tor complexes and the S-300s that Cyprus bought were deployed on Crete following an agreement with Greece.<br><br>Independent analysts say that the delivery of S-300 systems to Iran meets this countryÂ’s needs as well as RussiaÂ’s foreign policy strategies. Â“This purchase is quite logical of Iran and falls into its policy of upgrading the national air defense system,Â” Maxim Pyadishkin, editor of air and space publication Russia/CIS Observer, said. Â“This contract also fits well into RosoboronexportÂ’s strategy as they have always said that they do not just sell defense systems but offer defense systems ready to use.Â” Ivan Safranchuk, director of the Moscow office of the Global Security Institute, said that Â“Russia is consistent in boosting Syria and IranÂ’s capabilities of air self-defenseÂ”. Â“This is aimed to counter plans of the Unites States for a military action in the Middle East,Â” Mr. Safranchuk told Kommersant. Â“As soon as Moscow feels that the United States may finally decide to strike Iran, it comes forward to ease the tensions pushing Iran to continue collaboration with the IAEA on its nuclear program.Â”</span><br></div>
