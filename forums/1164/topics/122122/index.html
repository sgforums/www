Soldiers generally don't fight for sake of fighting (there might be a crazy few who do). It is fair to say that soldiers do fight for a cause and it could put their lives on the line. It may be for country, family and comrades or for extremist believes (ala AQ). Nobody fights simply for its own sake. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br><br>Also I don't know how one can possibly use "too much" technology.   Technologies are simply tools, be it the bow and arrows or the latest high tech gadget. Perhaps over-confidence in technology and not paying sufficient attention to the soldiers, strategies and contingency planning may be justifiable concern.<br><br>If that is what you mean, I agree as often, one gets the impression that little else matters besides our latest toys. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"></div>
