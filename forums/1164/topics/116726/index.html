"Indian knows how to avoid spy satellites " !<br><br>Rumours are define as " gossip passed around by word of mouth " according to the dictionary.<br><br>In fact every army in the world knows, how to avoid spy satellites. A lot of countries have been buy satellites photos from the US and also know when the satellites will pass by overhead each time. Yep by the way US have "blackbird" which can overfly india and take picture before you can even intercept that plane, so what so cocky about india !!!<br><br>Next you moron, think that in the whole of US - all the citizen there are  caucasian ? they have other races there and they have people who are train to speak in india language better then u. Get a good suntan and wrap up with clothes , they can even stand beside us without you knowing.<br><br>Yep kept busting at how bad the CIA or other intelligent agencies is not good compare to India. Let look at the facts, if refering to India - they have the worst intelligent agency !!!  Why ? I ask you how many Prime ministers ? in india got "killed" - the whole damn gandi gang !!! How many minsiters got killed ? Paliament also got storm by people and minister killed !!!!  Come on wake up !!!! Think the CIA or another other countries also got better record than india intelligents agency for not getting their head of state killed !!!<br><br>The reason why india intelligent agency failed to protected their VIPs is because they are too busy like u chasing after rumours then look into facts.</div>
