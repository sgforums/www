            <div class='col-md body'>i think we should discard the old mindset about numbers......<br><br>we should think more about capabilities......if we take away 5 LSTs and replace by 4 new endurance class 'LST', we must consider whether their capabilities have increased. a smaller number does not mean that the overall capabilities has decreased. just a basic comparision between the old ships and the new ships and you will notice the quantum leap in technology and capabilities</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>The Endurance Class can accomodate 2 Helis in Hangar as well as 2 10ton Helis on Open flight deck. So in Wartime scenario, the LST will carry at least 4 Helis. For our future acquisition of our  Helicopter ( most probably will be the latest Eurocopter cougars ) one of the criteria is for foldable rotor blades. So hope this answer your pausible wish for an extended Endurance.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I dun think the Apaches need to be permanently stationed onboard the LST. They can be like US with the carrier and LHD etc, While docking or non-operational time, the helos can be parked back at SBAB or CAB if allowed. Then at a moment's notice fly back in.<br><br>I do not expect our "Apache carrier" to be out-stationed for too long as that would be far too intimidating to any nation and with our current supply ships, i dun think we can last long.<br>the furthest i think would be the SouthChinaSea or IndianOcean where help is still a call away.(this is assuming in peace-time)<br><br>In war, this fellow can go as far out as she wans, provided a new supply solution is in place to support it. But then again, as singapore we are no super power, we only wanna protect what is ours therefore i do not see the need of getting out to where its more than necessary. This solution is mainly an attack platform.<br>I would consider it a silver bullet and only activated/announced when its necessary. Cos with 6-10 fully loaded Apaches with ammo reload, this is definately not a friendly ship.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_twisted.gif" alt="Twisted Evil" title="Twisted Evil"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by eurofighter:</div><div class="quote_body">Do our apaches have adequate protection against the corrosion resulting from operating a period of time over the sea? Since they are used manly for ops over land.<br>If RSAF is serious about operating or attaching apaches to LSTs, they can try fitting them with foldable blades. Read it somewhere(think it's AFM) that US Army is putting such blades on their apaches for trials.</div></blockquote>i'm not sure about apaches, but the pumas have MPAIs and it's not meant to filter out moisture or salts. The only way to protect the aircraft from all that salt is daily structural and compressor wash.<br><br>Once the aircraft comes back to land, there's is still some major washing to do.<br><br>Foldable blades, it should be possible if they use 2 pins to hold each blade.<br><br>But if the aircraft is to be left there for some time, exposing the pins will result in faster corrosion due to the environment. The pins need to be lubricated... and for it to be lubricated, u need to raise the rotor blades which needs a mechanical hoist, which is available only indoors.<br><br>Deployment on the LST is not as easy as most think, just putting the aircraft on the ship and activating it as and when. Most don't see the logistics that go through behind it, they don't see the extra equipment that needs to be brought on board, they don't see the manpower a squadron sacrifices on land, they don't know that the navy supplies only a certain type of fuel which is not the "best" fuel for that aircraft.<br><br>As most of you know that SAF is pretty ngiao... so when a detachment leaves the squadron they take along tools with them. And sometimes those remaining in the squadron can't work on the aircraft because the tools are not available.<br><br>Anyway this is referring to those ideas about leaving the aircraft on the LST on patrol and standby</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Just to give a scenario:<br><br>Assuming we are at war with N neighbour, all we have to do is to sail our Apache Carrier (with all the escorts) to the side of their country and we have all the power and flexibility in stopping their land forces in invading our tiny pathetic red dot. This will reduce our turn around time and offer us more chances in keeping our "frens" busy.<br><br>If assume is S neighbour, all we have to do is the park that guy in the middle of the sea to form our extra line of defence. An Apache i believe is not only meant for tanks, i mean if it can kill tanks, surely ships are no problem too...right?</div>
