              <p>Lionnoisy, you answered your question already you dumbass, the nearest base is RAAF Darwin!</p>
              <p>As for doing a wargame, you haven't got the intelligency nor the experience for conducting one. Come back when you get a brain!</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>If JORN did track a plane 500km out, then planes would have to be put on standby first! The plane would have to be identified plus you would also have to determine if it's hostile, JORN doesn't tell you this.</p>
              <p>However let's assume it's hostile, then yes up go the planes. 500km is not out of range for the Hornets considering they have SLAM-ER missiles (400km range). The Hornets would fly the rest of the distance to get the planes in range.</p>
              <p>Another option is to wait until they close in say 200km out.</p>
              <p>Also important to note is this. If there is an enemy fighter there, there must be a tanker there as well to blow up!</p>

              <p>Lionnoisy, you answered your question already you dumbass, the
              nearest base is RAAF Darwin!</p>
              <p>As for doing a wargame, you haven't got the intelligency nor the
              experience for conducting one. Come back when you get a brain!</p>
              <p>If JORN did track a plane 500km out, then planes would have to
              be put on standby first! The plane would have to be identified plus
              you would also have to determine if it's hostile, JORN doesn't tell
              you this.</p>
              <p>However let's assume it's hostile, then yes up go the planes.
              500km is not out of range for the Hornets considering they have
              SLAM-ER missiles (400km range). The Hornets would fly the rest of
              the distance to get the planes in range.</p>
              <p>Another option is to wait until they close in say 200km out.</p>
              <p>Also important to note is this. If there is an enemy fighter
              there, there must be a tanker there as well to blow up!</p>

                      be stupid to stay in JORN area for long. Have you seen the size of

                      The whole of SG is under JORN. If you knew some science, you would
                      also know that the range of JORN is variable due to the ionsphere

              <p>How can someone like you be the judge of whether a country is serious about their defence planning or not? What credentials have you got? Have you even finished your A levels?</p>
              <p>Don't speak when you don't have the foundations to speak on.</p>
              <p>As for RAAF Darwin, it has P3C Orion aircraft so it's not a paper kangaroo you dumbass. Plus the facilities are all there, so moving fighter craft there is a minor issue. I suggest you read more carefully, boy.</p>
              <p>RAAF Tindal approx 250km away has fighter aircraft based there permanently. It is the main base of the north as well if you read carefully.</p>
              <p>Just because the RAAF website doesn't list SLAM-ER doesn't mean it doesn't exist. You need to explore more sources before you comment.</p>
              <p>Finally, take a deep look at what Aegis coupled with SM2 can do. In a trial test, the F100 Spanish ship parked off Newcastle coast in Australia tracked and shot down every single plane as soon as they took off.</p>

              <p>Before you said 500km for your 'wargame' now you say it's meaningless you detect so far. Make up your goddamn mind! Of course it's better to have greater coverage, spastic.</p>
              <p>You also don't take into account all the other things I mention like the US Broad Maritime Area Surveillance Project. In fact you are so naive in your replies.</p>

              <p>How can someone like you be the judge of whether a country is
              serious about their defence planning or not? What credentials have
              you got? Have you even finished your A levels?</p>
              <p>Don't speak when you don't have the foundations to speak on.</p>
              <p>As for RAAF Darwin, it has P3C Orion aircraft so it's not a
              paper kangaroo you dumbass. Plus the facilities are all there, so
              moving fighter craft there is a minor issue. I suggest you read
              more carefully, boy.</p>
              <p>RAAF Tindal approx 250km away has fighter aircraft based there
              permanently. It is the main base of the north as well if you read
              carefully.</p>
              <p>Just because the RAAF website doesn't list SLAM-ER doesn't mean
              it doesn't exist. You need to explore more sources before you
              comment.</p>
              <p>Finally, take a deep look at what Aegis coupled with SM2 can do.
              In a trial test, the F100 Spanish ship parked off Newcastle coast
              in Australia tracked and shot down every single plane as soon as
              they took off.</p>

              <p>i think i might have deduced the problem of lionnoisy ! </p>
              <p>its called fatally flawed tunnel vision, otherwise known is bigotry. it can be described AS an approach to understanding or perspective which is static, fixed to one point of view. hence no point introducing or engaging in productive discussion with him. afterall its like water going down the drain, wont get into him anyway.</p>
              <p>@lionnoisy. i know next to nothing about radar systems, ADA and defence strategies. but from all the posts here, i learnt a few things which u clearly havent.</p>
              <p>1) australia's defence strategy/overall air defence framework relies on primarily on long range/early detection</p>
              <p>2) australia's AA / ADA assets are primarily sea based and mobile. no sense building a fixed and dense network when u are a continent with alot of coast line to cover.</p>
              <p>3) australia has a layered strategy of detect, track and intercept with sea and airborne assets.</p>
              <p>the gameplan is to see and shoot them down if they approach.</p>
              <p>but the problem is you are trying to apply singapore's ADA /AA defence framework onto australia.</p>
              <p>1) according to you SAF has alot more AA/ADA assets than australia. in your terms we pwn them in AA</p>
              <p>2)  you equate more assets into A BETTER FIGHTING CAPABILITY.</p>
              <p>our approach is to densely pack our ADA/AA assets into our homebase and to protect singapore from any raiders. if one bomb gets through and hits a HDB estate, the human cost is horrible. thats why we have such a dense network.</p>
              <p>and please ask yourself is this even relevant in australia's case ?</p>
              <p>if a bomb landed anywhere in central or northern australia, i bet my ass on the odds of it hitting a croc or a roo first before it even hits anybody. they are that sparsely populated. plus, darwin has little strategic value. you can bomb darwin to pieces and you'd have gained absolutely nothing in strategic terms. no damage to economy (maybe killing the crocs will hurt tourism - who knows?) or any major impact to australia. the only major strategic consequence of darwin is psychological. due to its lack of strategic viability, who would seriously want to attack ? its a low value target. but thats another long story altogether.</p>
              <p>have you even looked at a map lately ? most of australia's cities are located at the southern and south western australia. why bother even forward stationing most of your airforce in a place like darwin ? protect the toes to expose the backside for the elements ? if an enemy aircraft crosses darwin/northern territories, isnt it a clear and unambiguous sign that it professes hostile intent and fair game to be shot down?</p>
              <p>please remember that australia has this huge buffer space to play around with that singapore completely does not have. we probably could fit a few hundred singapores within australia's buffer/comfort zone before they decided to take a decisive response to shoot whatever it is down.</p>
              <p>ever figured that if australia were to adopt the dense AA/ADA umbrella network that singapore has, even with s-300 or patriot style systems, it would be a HUGE drain on manpower and resources ? even if they did, what are they going to be doing ? preventing the "enemy" from bombing the grain fields or cows ? simply not cost effective to do that.</p>
              <p>the way i see it , its simply a matter of adaptation to terrain and requirements. you are forcing singapore's adaptation into australia and demanding australia's air defence be interpreted in your shallow, immature terms.</p>
              <p>some food for thought for you lionnoisy : ask yourself why is the USN arming and building more burke class destroyers rather than the zumwalt class and building BMD defences in europe. going by your flawed logic, they should concentrate and build all the defences on land and in the US of A.</p>

              <p>sgstars,</p>
              <p>I only disagree with the following:</p>
              <p><span style="color: #333333; font-size: 14px; line-height: 16px;"><span style="font-style: italic;">ever figured that if australia were to adopt the dense AA/ADA umbrella network that singapore has, even with s-300 or patriot style systems, it would be a HUGE drain on manpower and resources ? even if they did, what are they going to be doing ? preventing the "enemy" from bombing the grain fields or cows ? simply not cost effective to do that.</span></span></p>
              <p>1. That it will be a huge drain of manpower and resources</p>
              <p>2. That there is nothing significant to bomb but fields, cows, and kangaroos. </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Examine the other side of the coin. The costs involves in pilot training, maintaining air bases, maintaining aircraft etc, versus deployed or semi-deployed ADA systems.  I am not suggesting that the Aussies need such a high density of Air Defence Systems coverage, but at least that ground based system should form the core.  </p>
              <p>Which is cheaper to build / buy?  AEGIS ships or land based Air Defence systems (Pac 3, essentially a BMD an exception)?</p>
              <p>Which is cheaper for 24-hour "ready to shoot" type of readiness?  Large number of aircraft (given the expanse of Australia) constantly sitting at alert 5 or alert 15?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>If I tear a hole in an air defense system, I can pretty much choose what I want to hit by altering my Strike packages through the gap.  I don't have to hit cows and fields.  Key structures would include joint UK-AUS-US intelligence gathering facilities, as well as centers of political activity, such as Canberra, and anywhere I need to drive home a point.</p>
              <p>In strategic context, no potential hostile threat except Russia is capable of projecting air and naval power so far out to Australia yet.  Russia's single carrier is now in the Middle East.  However, that is likely to change as Russia has pledged to build the largest navy, second to the US's.  With the Atlantic and Baltic seas firmly in NATO control, there is a possibility that Russian Naval power would be focused around the Pacific, Mediterrenean. </p>
              <p>Perhaps I read too much into the significance of things, but to me, Russia has demonstrated that it has not forgotten about the Far East with its large scale Naval exercise on the 26th of last month.  Often open military exercises are political events with agendas, I see no difference to believe otherwise this time.</p>

              <p>Lionnoisy, Australia does have airtankers, you stretch the bloody truth by saying that we don't. They are under procurement and will be here soon. When the Super Hornets arrive that will be 24 more little tankers as well. One tanker is already operating.</p>
              <p>As for AEW, this is also coming soon in the form of Wedgetails. The complete word is AWACS you dumbfuk.You must be so proud that SG has some pussy little AWACS planes that don't do shit.</p>
              <p>These are full on big birds that we're getting.</p>
              <p>Half the crap you say I don't get due to your lousy English.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Shotgun, your comparison is flawed in one major point. When you compare the cost of training pilots and AEGIS ships vs AA defence, yes it costs more to train pilots and AEGIS ships.  But you can do a hell of a lot more as well in terms of capability.. All AA defence can do is AA defence. With AEGIS ships, you have mobility, ASW, ASuW, and AAW. I won't even mention having pilots and planes.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>No such thing as alert 15.</p>
              <p>I don't think there are any joint UK-Aust facilities.</p>
              <p>Flying to Canberra in a fighter plane is not easy, if not impossible.</p>
              <p>Japan and Korea have very good navies that would belt the current Russian navy. This may change who knows, but unlikely.</p>
              <p>The Pacific will be controlled always by the Japan, Aust and USA triangle. How can you forget the US Pacific Fleet?</p>
              <p>As for the Meditterranean? Can you tell me exactly how the Russians can dominate this area? Have you looked at the map? At what part does Russia have a border with this sea?? Dominating a large sea via a tiny outlet thru Turkey , I don't think so.</p>

              <p>I sense some desperation in your reply, you normally reply like this when you are shaky and losing confidence.</p>
              <p>You just answered your own question, but maybe you are too scared to see the answers in your own conclusion.</p>
              <p>If you have no eyes, you cna have the best platforms and missiles in the world and they will be little more then fireworks going nowhere like the hundreds of SAMs the that Iraqis launched in desert storm that literally went nowhere.</p>
              <p>This is why your "JORN see so far is meaingless" point is incredibly silly I am amazed you even dare to post it without seeing how wrong it is.</p>
              <p>You still haven't answered my question:</p>
              <p>SAR-21 GL and MMS with advanced sighting systems are NOT future systems, in fact they were supposed to have replaced our M16/M203 NINE years ago, with the MMS being phased in eventually to keep the SAF up to date with the arms market.</p>
              <p>As it stands despite 9 YEARS later our front line units are still stuck with the M16/M203 and the only thing we see of SAR-21 GL is in wayang pictures. Worse, we end up selling the SAR-21 MMS to other armies while our own SAF uses the outdated version.</p>
              <p>Is this reasonable? </p>
              <p>Note that SAR-21 unlike Aegis, is a CURRENT weapons system that we have to rely on in war.</p>
              <p>Like you like to say, anything can happen in 9 YEARS, what if war breaks out? How lionnoisy how? Our soldiers go to war with weapons that cannot share common parts in the most basic fighting unit, the infantry section.</p>
              <p>Answer lionnoisy, or you don't dare?</p>
              <p>How come LCS thread you still haven't answer?</p>
