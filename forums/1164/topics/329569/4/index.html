Zimmerman" href="http://sgforums.com/wiki/Peter_D._Zimmerman"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0066cc;">Peter D. Zimmerman</span></span></a> of the <a title="Center for Strategic and International Studies" href="http://sgforums.com/wiki/Center_for_Strategic_and_International_Studies"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0066cc;">Center for Strategic and International Studies</span></span></a> testified about the calculation of success rates and accuracy in Israel and Saudi Arabia and discounted many of the statements and methodologies in Postol's report.</p>
              <ul>
              <li>Success Rate – the percentage of Scuds destroyed or deflected to non-populated areas </li>
              <li>Accuracy – the percentage of hits out of all the Patriots fired </li>
              </ul>
              <p>It is important to note the difference in terms when analyzing the performance of the system during the war.</p>
              <p>According to Zimmerman, in accordance with the standard firing doctrine on average four Patriots were launched at each incoming Scud – in Saudi Arabia an average of three Patriots were fired. If every Scud were deflected or destroyed the success rate would be 100% but the Accuracy would only be 25% and 33% respectively.</p>
              <p>Both testimonies state that part of the problems stem from its original design as an anti-aircraft system. PATRIOT was designed with <a class="mw-redirect" title="Proximity fuse" href="http://sgforums.com/wiki/Proximity_fuse"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0066cc;">proximity fused</span></span></a> warheads, which are designed to explode immediately prior to hitting a target spraying shrapnel out in a fan in front of the missile, either destroying or disabling the target. These missiles were fired at the target's center of mass. With aircraft this was fine, but considering the much higher speeds of TBMs, as well as the location of the warhead (usually in the nose), PATRIOT would most often hit closer to the tail of the Scud due to the delay present in the <a class="mw-redirect" title="Proximity fuse" href="http://sgforums.com/wiki/Proximity_fuse"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0066cc;">proximity fused</span></span></a> warhead, thus not destroying the TBM's warhead and allowing it to fall to earth.</p>
              <p>The Iraqi redesign of the Scuds also played a role. Iraq had redesigned its Soviet-style Scuds to be faster and longer ranged, but the changes weakened the missile and it was more likely to break up upon re-entering the atmosphere. This presented a larger number of targets as it was unclear which piece contained the warhead.</p>
              <p>What all these factors mean, according to Zimmerman, is that the calculation of "Kills" becomes more difficult. Is a kill the hitting of a warhead or the hitting of a missile? If the warhead falls into the desert because a PATRIOT hit its Scud, is it a success? What if it hits a populated suburb? What if all four of the engaging PATRIOT missiles hit, but the warhead falls anyway because the Scud broke up?</p>
              <p>According to the Zraket testimony there was a lack of high quality photographic equipment necessary to record the interceptions of targets. Therefore, PATRIOT crews recorded each launch on videotape, and damage assessment teams recorded the Scud debris that was found on the ground. Crater analysis was then used to determine if the warhead was destroyed before the debris crashed or not. Furthermore, part of the reason for the 30% improvement in success rate in Saudi Arabia compared to Israel is that the PATRIOT merely had to push the incoming Scud missiles away from military targets in the desert or disable the Scud's warhead in order to avoid casualties, while in Israel the Scuds were aimed directly at cities and civilian populations. The Saudi Government also censored any reporting of Scud damage by the Saudi press. The Israeli Government did not institute the same type of censorship. Furthermore, PATRIOT's success rate in Israel was examined by the IDF (Israel Defense Forces) who did not have a political reason to play up PATRIOT's success rate. The IDF counted any Scud that exploded on the ground (regardless of whether or not it was diverted) as a failure for the Patriot. Meanwhile, the U.S. Army who had many reasons to support a high success rate for PATRIOT, examined the performance of PATRIOT in Saudi Arabia.</p>

              <p>And note that this is a report on a missile that actually REPLACED our most capable missle, the I-Hawk, in the US arsenal.</p>
              <p>This is why militaries want to keep the hostile air OUT of the cities in the first place. Once the enemy penetrates your fighter layer you are pretty much in trouble.</p>
              <p>What will happen is that the goal of a missile or bomb is simply to hit the ground, if it does so in one piece or many is not really the issue for it, especially in Singapore. Even if you shoot down a plane it does not just vaporize, there is significant wreckage that can cause plentry of trouble for Singapore if it crashes into a populated area.</p>

              <p>Your perception and reality are wrong.</p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>You didn't answer me correctly lionnoisy, giving a wrong answer does not mean you've answered:</strong></span></p>
              <p>You post so much for what?</p>
              <p>What is the point of having so many short-ranged radars when you are vulnerable to a heavy ECW environment?</p>
              <p>Case in point, the Iraqis stocked up on a lot of radars and SAMs, prehaps even DENSER then Singapore's ADA in some areas but all it took was for the allies was to deploy EF-111s and they didn't even manage to shoot down a SINGLE allied aircraft when an EF-111 was on station.</p>
              <p>The only solution is the old one, and that was to use their own air force to chase away the EF-111s.</p>

              <p>Are you forgetting that with a standoff range of over 500km and the ability to detect stealth on the surface and the air there is this concept called INTERCEPTION?</p>
              <p>How come your concept of defence is all passive and wait for the enemy to come to you?</p>

              <p>WRONG</p>
              <p>Did you see the number of SAM launches and AA fire put up over Baghdad during Desert Storm? If you don't have air superiority all you are doing is damage mitigation.</p>
              <p>Do you think Singapore can stand a few bombs to our vital areas?</p>

              <p>You post this for what? The upgraded I-Hawk is a generation behind the Patrioit series which did not perform up to scratch for the purpose of defending cities from missile attack. What you posted is simply a wayang ad without considering what happens in reality.</p>
              <p>So who's the want with a lack of perception and reality.</p>
              <p>So your idea of sleeping soundly is to let the enemy come up to your doorstep and then trying to shoot them down instead of facing them out further with standoff ability with superbugs and AMRAAMs?</p>
              <p><strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">You are trying to argue for the superiority of a point-defence air defence model in an age of ECW, smart weapons, stealth and standoff munitions over a standoff air defence model?</span><span style="color: #000000;">Wow, do you go outside wearing your clothes on backwards? You wear your shoes on your head and your hat on your feet ah?</span></strong></p>

              <p>Answering wrongly does not mean you've answered.</p>
              <p>Please answer:</p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>1. How is it even possible to set up your kind of proposed IADS to cover the whole of Australia?</strong></span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>2. Is Singapore reliance on IADS a result of us having a great idea, or no choice because of our lack of depth?</strong></span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>3. Which viable airforce in the region can really afford to bomb</strong></span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>4. Which is more cost effective and practical? A lionnoisy-style IADS that waits for the enemy to come or JORN based-standoff defence based on sea and air responses?</strong></span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>If you cannot answer, you've just wasted your effort reposting.</strong></span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>And also you haven't answered on the issue of degaussing for demining work in your LCS thread which you quietly left.</strong></span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>Why you always leave your threads quietly after you are cornered?</strong></span></p>

              <p>Your perception and reality are wrong.</p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>You didn't answer me
              correctly lionnoisy, giving a wrong answer does not mean you've

              <p>You post so much for what?</p>
              <p>What is the point of having so many short-ranged radars when you
              are vulnerable to a heavy ECW environment?</p>
              <p>Case in point, the Iraqis stocked up on a lot of radars and
              SAMs, prehaps even DENSER then Singapore's ADA in some areas but
              all it took was for the allies was to deploy EF-111s and they
              didn't even manage to shoot down a SINGLE allied aircraft when an<span style="color: #ff0000;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"> EF-111 was on st</span></span>ation.</p>
              <p>The only solution is the old one, and that was to use their own
              air force to chase away the EF-111s.</p>
              <p>Are you forgetting that with a standoff range of over 500km and
              the ability to detect stealth on the surface and the air there is
              this concept called INTERCEPTION?</p>
              <p>How come your concept of defence is all passive and wait for the
              enemy to come to you?</p>
              <p>WRONG</p>
              <p>Did you see the number of SAM launches and AA fire put up over
              Baghdad during Desert Storm? If you don't have air superiority all
              you are doing is damage mitigation.</p>
              <p>Do you think Singapore can stand a few bombs to our vital
              areas?</p>
              <p>You post this for what? The upgraded I-Hawk is a generation
              behind the <span style="color: #ff0000;">Patrioit </span>series which did not perform up to scratch for
              the purpose of defending cities from missile attack. What you
              posted is simply a wayang ad without considering what happens in
              reality.</p>
              <p>So who's the want with a lack of perception and reality.</p>
              <p>So your idea of sleeping soundly is to let the enemy come up to
              your doorstep and then trying to shoot them down instead of facing
              them out further with standoff ability with superbugs and
              AMRAAMs?</p>
              <p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">You are trying to argue

              <p>You don't seem to have woken up, if you have woken up you would have seen that the Australians are already having one of the best solutions to this problem.</p>
              <p>Instead you are still going on and on uselessly on why these problems require your kind of ineffective point-defence solutions when basically what the Australians are doing are addressing the problem, you are not.</p>
              <p>You just want a long list of names and SAMs and anti-air guns used in no context except to make long posts and make it seem like you understand the concepts of air defence when all you are suggesting is bad idea after bad idea, as well as thinking that such complex concepts and systems can be solved simply by throwing money at the problems to buy this or that system without even a CONCEPT to use them under.</p>

              <p>And please don't be retarded, the only thing you seem to be in is in denial.</p>
              <p>If anything it's pretty obvious that the Aussies are doing what it takes to protect themselves in the light of how things in the region develop.</p>
              <p>You are always focused on today and now because it allows you to make useless threads like this asking more useless questions. But in reality to plan for anything especially when it comes to regional defence requires thinking decades in advance, the difference between Singapore and Australia is that Australia makes it's intentions known and open to public scrutiny while Singapore only lets out the good news and keeps failures quiet.</p>
              <p>You claim you always want to know the truth and are very good at digging out information and asking question.</p>

              <p>Don't be silly, the best solution to hijack is not shooting down the plane but to prevent the hijack in the first place, if that fails you already have a suck thumb incident.</p>
              <p>For example, our RSAF and air defences are totally useless if a plane is hijacked from Changi airport with the intention to crash it somewhere in Singapore. Even if you shoot it down it is going to fall somewhere in Singapore, possibily in somewhere populated and people are still going to die.</p>
              <p>Hijacked aircraft are not so much an air defence problem then a security problem, but given you like to have all your security issues on backwards like advocating point defence over defence in depth I am not surprised you seem to think the solution to hijacked aircraft is to use SAMs and guns to shoot them down.</p>

              <p>WRONG, you are making a conceptual mistake.</p>
              <p>The idea of JORN is not to watch the skies over their own cities and land as in it is to look over the skies and land of their POTENTIAL enemies and the approach vectors.</p>
              <p>They whole idea is to know when your enemy is taking off planes and sending ships and where they are heading well in advance before they even come in range of your conventional sensors.</p>
              <p>So you want JORN to cover cities in SE corner and west for what? You are making the same mistake in the defence of Singapore during WW2, and that was to position and point the guns the WRONG way.</p>

              <p>LOL, he has been at this for years, I doubt he'll change soon.</p>
              <p>He will not change because he's not interested in bettering himself as a person, but more interested in feeling good about himself. Hence he is reluctant to do things that will challange his "feel good" notions about himself, such as taking a critical look at his own beliefs and behaviour.</p>
              <p>Instead he will blame others for his own failures, calling them Aussie-worshipers and what have you not without even stopping to think that it is those people he thinks who are the traitors towards the Singaporean ego that are the ones who are probably far truer Singaporean patroits then him and his shallow behaviour in here.</p>
              <p>Does a person who stands up for Singapore do so by engaging in dishonest acts like creating clones and trying to trick others into believing he has more support and to manipulate others?</p>
              <p>So lionnoisy, if you dare, answer to all this.</p>
              <p>I doubt he will.</p>
              <p>But well, it's still fun to pwn him.</p>
              <p>But really, nobody takes him seriously.</p>

              <p>I find this very funny because this picture which you keep using:</p>
              <p><a class="thumbed_image" rel="lightbox" href="http://defence-data.com/storypic/scanrange.jpg"><img src="http://defence-data.com/storypic/scanrange.jpg" alt="" width="288" height="195"></a></p>
              <p>Comes from the webpage that answers your question:</p>
              <blockquote>
              <p><strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">Jindalee over-the-horizon radar was used to track military aircraft landing and taking off from Dili Airport, in East Timor, on 20 September 1999, when Australia-led Interfet forces began securing the former Indonesian province from militia violence. Australian Hercules C130 transports were detected from 1500 kilometres away by a 6 kilometres-long radar array at Longreach (Queensland), and at a similar site at Alice Springs (Northern Territory).</span></strong></p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>Aircraft images were displayed on radar consoles in Adelaide and Melbourne, 2600 kilometres from the action. Royal Australian Air Force commanders said the radar was accurate enough to show aircraft turning on their landing approach to Dili Airport.</strong></span></p>
              </blockquote>
              <p>Note it was used in 1999, and at EXTREME range and it more then worked. The network has been much improved since then.</p>
              <p>If it can do this at 1500km, 300km is chicken feat.</p>
              <p>On the other hand your 50km requirement for AA umbrella will be totally blind until the last moment.</p>
              <p>Normal civillian radars deal with thousands of flights in a day, the technology to track such numbers is already well in place.</p>
              <p>I think you only want to listen to those who say cannot, what about those who say can?</p>
              <p>Let's see what those who say can say:</p>
              <p>I find it interesting, you keep using your picture from THAT webpage but don't dare to quote what it says.</p>
              <p>Why ah?</p>
              <p>Being dishonest again?</p>
              <p>Rest assured that when we try to take off our planes, the Aussies will know about it. Even our stealth frigates can be picked up by them.</p>
              <p>I understand it's very frightening for you, that's why you would like to think cannot.</p>

              <p>Have you learned nothing?</p>
              <p>How good is your small umbrella in an ECM environment and under saturation supersonic cruise missile attack and NO ROOM for error on a small island?</p>
              <p>You said you woke up to the realities of air defence after reading my post, but now have apparently gone back to sleep again?</p>
              <p>The only thing that will be leaking is your small and "good" AA umbrella.</p>
              <p>What's next? You prefer to be in a Humvee instead of an Abrams when people are throwing APFSDS rounds your way?</p>
              <p>Let me ask you a question instead:</p>
              <p>Do u mean when any enemy launch hundreds of supersonic cruise missiles hundreds of miles away with heavy jamming and</p>
              <p>sg air AA can only start to track at 50km?Can their computers cope with the work loads?</p>
              <p>will their missiles be fast enough to catch everything? the missiles are faster then even I-Hawk</p>
              <p>can their AA guns even hit anything</p>
              <p>I think everyone say cannot.</p>
