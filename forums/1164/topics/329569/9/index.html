              <p>Coles' report, published on 12 September 2008, is brutally frank and
              exposes serious weaknesses in MoD procedures and management. He states
              that the procurement was "constrained... by the initial choice of ship
              design, it has been managed to get the ship into service as soon as
              possible, and it has been characterised by shortcomings in project
              management and governance and collective wishful thinking".</p>
              <p>Furthermore, Coles and his review team judged that the
              ship <span style="color: #ff0000;">"is unlikely to meet all of the requirements" </span>of the delivery
              contract awarded to Tenix Defence Systems (now part of BAE Systems
              Australia) in July 2004, and that "remedial work" is necessary to allow

              <p>Most damaging, perhaps, are the assertions that even when
              the improvements have been completed, the Royal New Zealand Navy (RNZN)
              will have to impose operating limitations on the ship, and that its

              <blockquote>
              <p>There have
              been teething problems with the first ship, HMNZS Canterbury
              which we are in the process of addressing.</p>
              <p>The Coles
              Report indicated that the ship is intrinsically safe and
              with some short term remedied work will deliver the Defence
              Force "a cost effective, versatile and valuable military
              capability throughout its service life".</p>
              <p>So too will the
              other six ships, the offshore and inshore patrol vessels.
              The Navy has been impressed with the overall performance of
              the ships during their sea trials.</p>
              <p>However, they will be
              accepted only when the contractor Tenix, now BAE, has
              addressed all aspects of performance contracted for,
              including the seaboats on board the ships.</p>
              <p>Taken together,
              the Government is looking at an investment of well over $1
              billion in new ships and infrastructure and upgraded
              capabilities for the Navy.</p>
              <p>The Air Force is undergoing a
              major renewal of every flying platform worth nearly $1.9
              billion.</p>
              <p>The two Boeing 757s have already proven their
              value during the 2006 riots in Tonga. The modification of
              these aircraft so that they can carry both freight and
              passengers will further improve their utility in tasks such
              as the transport of NZDF personnel and disaster and
              humanitarian relief.</p>
              <p>The first upgraded 757 returned to
              New Zealand in August and is currently being re-introduced

              <p>This is another anti--oz postings,quoting Australians' opinions,</p>
              <p>including the Defence Minister of the Commonwealth!</p>
              <p>Wow!Do u think the top brass in Defence is anti--Australia?</p>
              <blockquote>
              <p>What the defence public relations team won't tell you is that these
              are testing times for the navy. There are <span style="color: #ff0000;">not enough sailors to man its
              fleet, many of its ships and helicopters are ill-equipped for war, half
              of its submarine fleet lives in dry dock</span> and a new generation of young
              Australians are baulking at a life on the high seas.</p>
              <p>Not surprisingly, morale also is being tested, with squabbles
              breaking out among overworked sailors and commanders firing off orders
              telling them to stop complaining about their lot and display greater
              leadership. The top brass is so concerned about disgruntled sailors
              talking to the media that it issued a warning that leakers were a
              betrayal of the "value set" of the RAN.</p>
              <p>Last week, <span style="color: #ff0000;">Defence Minister Joel Fitzgibbon d</span>eclared he was sick of
              people talking about the future when so much of today's Australian
              Defence Force was ill-equipped forcombat.</p>
              <p>"We spend a lot of time thinking and talking about important
              capability as we look far out into the future, but we seem to spend
              much less time talking about the capability we need to do the things we
              do right now and on a regular basis," Fitzgibbon said.</p>
              <p>Naval expert Andrew Davies, of the Australian Strategic Policy
              Institute, says the navy is facing one of its most challenging eras.
              "They have had a lot of trouble getting war fighting capability on to
              the frigates, the submarines are undermanned and the helicopters
              especially, with failure of the (now scrapped) Seasprites, do not
              provide the capabilities a modern warship needs.</p>
              <p>"The navy is at a point now where it really has to step up.</p>
              </blockquote>

              <blockquote>
              <p>The navy's woes are a combination of bad luck, bad management and
              bad timing. Mismanagement of important projects has resulted in the
              planned upgrade of four of the navy's FFG frigates being delayed by
              <span style="color: #ff0000;">almost five years, </span>blowing out the total cost to more than $1.5
              billion. The disastrous Kaman Seasprite helicopter project finally was
              cancelled by Fitzgibbon in April at a cost to the taxpayer of $1.1
              billion.</p>
              <p>Other weak spots include the abandonment of plans to upgrade the
              Anzac class frigates into capable air defence platforms and a
              continuing and alarming shortfall in the navy's anti-submarine warfare
              capabilities. "The surface fleet is ill-equipped for high-level
              operations," Davies says.</p>
              <p>But the biggest single challenge to the navy today is not its lack
              of capable equipment but its lack of qualified people to operate it.</p>

              <p>To Oz defence,time is not an essence.</p>
              <p>remember APC M 113 upgrade  cannot be completed in almost 8 years!!</p>
              <p>and many more.For the most powerful conventional subs,</p>
              <p>while they are still upgrade (or fixing the problems of design and</p>
              <p>workmanship in the original productions),they already get A$5 m to research</p>
              <p>on new subs.The new subs may come with cruise missiles,and much more.</p>

              <p>He already totally pwned in here mah, he adding basically what is the same old posts trying to repeat his old arguments does not change that fact.</p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>Let me see, he mentioned the M113 take very long to upgrade, that one status:</strong></span></p>

              <p> </p>
              <p>Basically what he's doing is simply waiting for a while before repeating his old arguments, to bother to answer them is a waste of time and energy.</p>
              <p>I'll wait for him to really try something serious and new before I even bother with it... that's when the real comedy starts.</p>

              <p>Lol, if he goes to defence talk he'll get pwned even worse... they have a zero tolerance policy for cranks like him in there.</p>
              <p>Basically I don't think he'll go to defence talk, or he'll quickly get bored... this is because defence talk is so used to having a nationalistic crank turning up now and then to talk rubbish about how great the military of their particular country is that lionnoisy is actually pretty unremarkable.</p>
              <p>Additionally, he will face the prospect of actually having to face the people of the nations he always slanders, and I suspect he's too much of a coward to actually dare to debate these things with them, especially with REAL Australian soldiers. He dares to spread his rubbish in here because he's spreading it precisely for only Singaporeans to see... he does not dare to actually bring these things up to the people of the nation he slanders...</p>
              <p>Actually I think it would be pretty funny to see lionnoisy blunder around in defence talk, the pwning he will recieve will be utterly EPIC.</p>
