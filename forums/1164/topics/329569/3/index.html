              <p>sgstars,</p>
              <p>I only disagree with the following:</p>
              <p><span style="color: #333333; font-size: 14px; line-height: 16px;"><span style="font-style: italic;">ever figured that if australia were to adopt
              the dense AA/ADA umbrella network that singapore has, even with
              s-300 or patriot style systems, it would be a HUGE drain on
              manpower and resources ? even if they did, what are they going to
              be doing ? preventing the "enemy" from bombing the grain fields or
              cows ? simply not cost effective to do that.</span></span></p>
              <p>1. That it will be a huge drain of manpower and resources</p>
              <p>2. That there is nothing significant to bomb but fields, cows,
              and kangaroos. </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Examine the other side of the coin. The costs involves in pilot
              training, maintaining air bases, maintaining aircraft etc, versus
              deployed or semi-deployed ADA systems.  I am not suggesting
              that the Aussies need such a high density of Air Defence Systems
              coverage, but at least that ground based system should form the
              core.  </p>
              <p>Which is cheaper to build / buy?  AEGIS ships or land based
              Air Defence systems (Pac 3, essentially a BMD an exception)?</p>
              <p>Which is cheaper for 24-hour "ready to shoot" type of readiness?
               Large number of aircraft (given the expanse of Australia)
              constantly sitting at alert 5 or alert 15?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>If I tear a hole in an air defense system, I can pretty much
              choose what I want to hit by altering my Strike packages through
              the gap.  I don't have to hit cows and fields.  Key
              structures would include joint UK-AUS-US intelligence gathering
              facilities, as well as centers of political activity, such as
              Canberra, and anywhere I need to drive home a point.</p>

              <p>hey hello shotgun ! think you should know me from elsewhere.</p>
              <p>like i said, i dont know much about AA/ADA but me take on the whole issue is this :</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>1) Flexibility : with ships , you basically have a mobile AA platform that can reach almost any major australian city since they are all located at near the coastal regions. with their purchase of SH and possibly growlers and AEGIS, you have a potential weapons package that can cover as much ground for as little cost as possible. it isnt static. but a rather dynamic system.</p>
              <p>2) S-300 and patriot style systems use very large missiles. i m not too sure about the type for fuel they use, but i m assuming its non solid fuel. there's a whole lot of issues regarding storage/refueling and defueling such missiles. big pain in the ass for handling too. might piss the australian greenies. even if its solid fuel, its going to be prohibitively expensive storing it and supplying it across australia.</p>
              <p>was thinking along lionnoisy's lines of having a very dense/packed AA/ADA network across australia. but i see your point. didnt think about it. having a couple of such batteries in like a few choice cities seems like a pretty good idea now. theater missile defence. maybe this is a chink in australia's ada/aa shield.</p>
              <p>but even then, the cost of these batteries arent cheap. the radar and tracking systems alone are a few hundred million. not to mention the cost of upkeeping them and training the manpower. manpower costs go up too. as it is, australia is struggling to find people for their armed forces. the costs of establishing a missile defence arm and funding the follow up logisitics requirement might not be a politically palatable (i .e hostile public opposition to arms procurement, for instance, take a look at how the aus public isnt too happy with the money sunk into f35 program and the f18 purchases, was a big scandal over there if i aint mistaken) decision even though its a sound decision.</p>
              <p>and another possible thing to look at is the desire. maybe the brass feel that what they have is sufficient enough for the current threat scenarios. why provoke and raise unnecessary tensions and trouble by telling everyone, "hey , i m going to build a big air defence network right here if you blokes dont mind me". certain to raise eyebrows and create unease within the region. like for the same reason why we persisted with the SM1 for so many years even though we probably felt they were obsolete a long time ago. </p>
              <p>by putting the missiles on ships instead of land u get several benefits. no green groups to piss you off. dramatic enhancement of your fleet capability and protection. mobility and flexibility in deployment (not something that can be easily done cross country in australia). PLUS , you get the added bonus of doing it on the sly. you dont want anybody to know where is your ace in hand. remember, few regional countries have the means or abilities to probably detect and track the movement of aussie AEGIS destroyers. that makes deploying enemy aircraft harder. and even tied up pierside, aussie AEGIS can play a role too. it becomes a static defence. truly very handy assets.  </p>
              <p>a small scenario exercise? i really have no idea. say australia splashes out on either a fleet of 50 JSF versus a patriot/pac 3 system country wide (inclusive of roo and croc land) . </p>
              <p>patriots provide a deterrent value . a shield of sorts. but thats it. it can be neutralised (not sure how and by what means but most definitely expensive). its not able to turn into a active asset. you cant send your pac batteries to go hunting for ships or enemy troops. once the need for them has been overcome/compromised/supersceded, its as good as useless.</p>
              <p>on the other hand, the F35s are flexible. they are like a sword. u can use it to kill things or you can use it to open letters (a gross overstatement but possible) a sword posesses a deterrent value as well. and provides you a whole lot more options for the money spent.</p>
              <p>perhaps if ya look at the projected lifetime operating costs and consider how the added dimension of possiblities, its easier to justify more aircraft.</p>
              <p>sorry if i lapse into cliches such as sword and shield but i figured the key component of the aus defence planners would be flexibility. in conclusion, improvement of the aussie air defence would be nice, giving them more SAM or TMD assets but i guess they havent done so for their own reasons, namely either political or the desire not to provoke or create unnecessary awareness.</p>
              <p>on another note, was reading about the FPDA. the key and biggest component of FPDA is this joint AUS-SIN-MAL-UK IADS HQ located in butterworth penang. an australian air marshall is the nominal head of this HQ. not too sure if i am reading it right but the australians probably do have a very in depth knowledge of the region's air projection and defence capabilities. hence their procurement policies ?</p>

              <p> </p>
              <p>hey hello shotgun ! think you should know me from elsewhere.</p>
              <p>like i said, i dont know much about AA/ADA but me take on the
              whole issue is this :</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>1) Flexibility : with ships , you basically have a mobile AA
              platform that can reach almost any major australian city since they
              are all located at near the coastal regions. with their purchase of
              SH and possibly growlers and AEGIS, you have a potential weapons
              package that can cover as much ground for as little cost as
              possible. it isnt static. but a rather dynamic system.</p>
              <p>2) S-300 and patriot style systems use very large missiles. i m
              not too sure about the type for fuel they use, but i m assuming its
              non solid fuel. there's a whole lot of issues regarding
              storage/refueling and defueling such missiles. big pain in the ass
              for handling too. might piss the australian greenies. even if its
              solid fuel, its going to be prohibitively expensive storing it and
              supplying it across australia.</p>
              <p>was thinking along lionnoisy's lines of having a very
              dense/packed AA/ADA network across australia. but i see your point.
              didnt think about it. having a couple of such batteries in like a
              few choice cities seems like a pretty good idea now. theater
              missile defence. maybe this is a chink in australia's ada/aa
              shield.</p>
              <p>but even then, the cost of these batteries arent cheap. the
              radar and tracking systems alone are a few hundred million. not to
              mention the cost of upkeeping them and training the manpower.
              manpower costs go up too. as it is, australia is struggling to find
              people for their armed forces. the costs of establishing a missile
              defence arm and funding the follow up logisitics requirement might
              not be a politically palatable (i .e hostile public opposition to
              arms procurement, for instance, take a look at how the aus public
              isnt too happy with the money sunk into f35 program and the f18
              purchases, was a big scandal over there if i aint mistaken)
              decision even though its a sound decision.</p>
              <p>and another possible thing to look at is the desire. maybe the
              brass feel that what they have is sufficient enough for the current
              threat scenarios. why provoke and raise unnecessary tensions and
              trouble by telling everyone, "hey , i m going to build a big air
              defence network right here if you blokes dont mind me". certain to
              raise eyebrows and create unease within the region. like for the
              same reason why we persisted with the SM1 for so many years even
              though we probably felt they were obsolete a long time
              ago. </p>
              <p>by putting the missiles on ships instead of land u get several
              benefits. no green groups to piss you off. dramatic enhancement of
              your fleet capability and protection. mobility and flexibility in
              deployment (not something that can be easily done cross country in
              australia). PLUS , you get the added bonus of doing it on the sly.
              you dont want anybody to know where is your ace in hand. remember,
              few regional countries have the means or abilities to probably
              detect and track the movement of aussie AEGIS destroyers. that
              makes deploying enemy aircraft harder. and even tied up pierside,
              aussie AEGIS can play a role too. it becomes a static defence.
              truly very handy assets.  </p>
              <p>a small scenario exercise? i really have no idea. say australia
              splashes out on either a fleet of 50 JSF versus a patriot/pac 3
              system country wide (inclusive of roo and croc land) . </p>
              <p>patriots provide a deterrent value . a shield of sorts. but
              thats it. it can be neutralised (not sure how and by what means but
              most definitely expensive). its not able to turn into a active
              asset. you cant send your pac batteries to go hunting for ships or
              enemy troops. once the need for them has been
              overcome/compromised/supersceded, its as good as useless.</p>
              <p>on the other hand, the F35s are flexible. they are like a sword.
              u can use it to kill things or you can use it to open letters (a
              gross overstatement but possible) a sword posesses a deterrent
              value as well. and provides you a whole lot more options for the
              money spent.</p>
              <p>perhaps if ya look at the projected lifetime operating costs and
              consider how the added dimension of possiblities, its easier to
              justify more aircraft.</p>
              <p>sorry if i lapse into cliches such as sword and shield but i
              figured the key component of the aus defence planners would be
              flexibility. in conclusion, improvement of the aussie air defence
              would be nice, giving them more SAM or TMD assets but i guess they
              havent done so for their own reasons, namely either political or
              the desire not to provoke or create unnecessary awareness.</p>
              <p>on another note, was reading about the FPDA. the key and biggest
              component of FPDA is this joint AUS-SIN-MAL-UK IADS HQ located in
              butterworth penang. an australian air marshall is the nominal head
              of this HQ. not too sure if i am reading it right but the
              australians probably do have a very in depth knowledge of the
              region's air projection and defence capabilities. hence their
              procurement policies ?</p>

              <p>I think I'm not so extreme to insist that ADF should cover every inch of Ozzie airspace with PAC-2 or PAC-3 coverage.</p>
              <p>1. I do agree with your point of flexibility and redeployability of ADA on warships.  No arguments there.  However, it also comes at the cost of Vulnerability from maritime threats, especially submarines. I've been going at this like a broken record, my apologies.  When ADA radars turn on, ESM equipment on submarines are able to pick it up and help them locate the AAW ship, thereby giving away their location, making them vulnerable targets for submarines.  </p>
              <p>2.  Large missiles?  I don't think they really considered this a problem since they DID consider the PAC-3 missile system before. Naturally, that was for their BMD initiative.  I'm suggesting PAC-2 Systems for anti- aircraft warfare, not for BMD coverage.   They are significantly less costly when compared to the PAC-3. </p>
              <p>I think you've mentioned the precise scenario of the defense gap posed by a ADA coverage whose core is based on a naval platform.  Given their versatility, they can be sent out on ASuW tasking. Great, excellent versatility! What happens to ADA coverage at home when that happens?  Ships move out of position, gaps appear in defensive umbrella, that is precisely the problem I am bringing up.  What I am saying is that, they should have the core-ADA coverage land based with PAC-2 systems, to cover these gaps. </p>
              <p>Yes, land based ADA can be "neutralised." But not easily, because, you can either only target it by Anti Radiation missiles, originating from the "Air" domain, or ground troops, which must first penetrate the maritime defenses, or Air defenses before they can set foot on Australia. They certainly cant be shot at by submarines, which are now identified as one of the most potent threats of naval warfare.</p>
              <p>FPDA is an agreement, so is the IADS for it.  Its existence in peace time is pretty much "paper."  As far as I know, there is no concrete implementation of it.  Its like a framework in the event that something really does happens.  The focus of this IADS was SEA, not Oceana.  As far as Australia goes, its out of FPDA's IADS coverage. </p>

              <p>haha, no contest from me here. like i said, i dont know much about ADA.</p>
              <p>was just trying to debunk lionnoisy's nonsense.</p>
              <p>hmm, but i dont think FPDA can be written off that simply. i was thinking more along the lines that the Australian's know SEA's IADS and the capabilities of the various nations in attacking and defeating them as a result of FPDA. hence maybe their present focus is on defending against any possible air attack from "rogue" SEA nations, and having sufficiently capable resources to do so.</p>
              <p>in the very long run, like you mentioned, currently ATM , the only possible "hostile" nation that might have the capabilities to attack australia would be russia. and even then, that is a remote bordering on the impossible proposition. in the likelihood of a more nearby threat from another rising power in asia, i m sure oz will get more capable IADS toys</p>

              <p>But now you are making a point based on long ranged air defence? To the point you can even dare to post a map showing the combat radius of potential enemy aircraft? The exact kind of zone that JORN provides COVERAGE for?</p>

              </blockquote>
              <p>WRONG, AA guns are prehaps the WORST option to deal with a hijacked plane. Firstly they have a lack of range, and secondly they do not make a "clean" kill of the aircraft, the shot-down aircraft will simply crash to the ground in the city which was it's point in the first place, the damage caused is the same.</p>
              <p>And worse, the hijacked aircraft can simply fly around the combat radius of the AA guns or simply fly too high enough to be out of engagement range.</p>
              <p>The best way to deal with a hijacked plane is to intercept it with another aircraft, which is what all militaries actually DO, except yours prehaps.</p>
              <p>AA guns on their own in modern warfare are practically useless, if they are not part of an IADS they are simply sitting ducks for a wild weasel standoff munition.</p>
              <p>This is the fatal flaw in your plan, you are pushing for the retarded idea that each and every single Australian city must have an IADS like Singapore, we can afford to set up such an IADS for the simple reason we have no other option and have nowhere else to run to nor do we have the space to spread out our defences. </p>
              <p>Trying to set up an IADS to defend each and every Australian city ala. Singapore is like your 3000 ship navy idea to defend each and every square inch of Australian waters to counter and enemy that can pop up anywhere and anyhow.</p>
              <p>Also since you posted your "enemy aircraft range map", go and study it with some common sense.</p>
              <p>Note that these represent the combat radius of enemy aircraft, note that Australia is at the very limit of their endurance, and in any case if the PRC wants to attack Australia they have to fly to the very limit of their endurance, for half of that flight or even more, they will already be picked up by JORN. This gives the Australians HOURS to respond to any air attack from the PRC.</p>
              <p>And what is the best way to respond for it? To wait in their cities with your "minimum" AA guns and wait the several hours for the enemy to arrive or to meet them out at sea with their air force and navy?</p>
              <p>Also note that any air force save the USAF flying sorties to Australia will be unable to keep up a good operational tempo due to the atrocious turnabout times required. The roundabout trip is simply too long and the journey too fraught with risks given they are flying at the limits of their endurance.</p>
              <p>This is why for most air forces trying to stragetic bomb Australia is simply not a practical option. Any potential enemy trying to attack Australia has to grapple with issues of operational temo, distance, logistics and what have you not. Unlike your imaginary army in your "wargames", they cannot pop up "anywhere, anytime and anyhow".</p>
              <p>Singapore has no choice but to rely on an IADS due to our utter lack of depth, but if we had the choice this is NOT the way we want to fight. In fact our battle plan involves one that hopefully does not need us to use our IADS at ALL by trying to gain air superiority or even air supremacy over any potential enemy with our air force to the point that we won't have to use our air defences at all, if possible.</p>
              <p>So all the stocking up on air defence is not a sign of our strength, it's actually a sign of our WEAKNESS. It's not because we have some great idea but because we have a great weakness in our lack of depth that we need to stuff it full of guns and SAMs.</p>
              <p>But you don't seem to understand that, thinking that this is a "great" idea that the SAF has that the world has to follow.</p>

              <p>Don't worry about Lionnoisy's stuff, most of it are pretty extreme.  Usually he will debunk himself some way or another.  Besides, our resident lion tamer, SgTrex will take care of him. </p>
              <p>He has brought up an interesting issue though.  I personally do not believe naval AAW should form the core component of a country's IADS, with reasons stated in my previous posts. </p>
              <p>These arguements are endless because its a tug of war between Military Effectiveness vs Political Effectiveness.  </p>
              <p>Skew to one side too much, you'd either be spending too much on defense, or too little to guarantee security when push comes to shove.  I'm a realist when it comes to military stuff.  Whatever that I have, has to work as advertised when the sh!t hits the fan. Unfortunately, politicians are still the ones who write the cheque.</p>
              <p>For a country thats never been invaded before, and always fought beyond their shores, its also understandable why they don't base much of the AAW capabilities on land. </p>

              <p>i just find JORN in north.Even i consider the Rapier,the most</p>
              <p>Oz get is 2 layers.Besides RAAF aircarfts,AA is low level</p>
              <p>of RBS--70(Bolide)---</p>
              <p>8 km range,a ceiling of about 4.5km (15,000ft).</p>
              <p>How about the middle to high level / range AA,</p>
              <p>say ceiling 15000 to 30,000 ft and range up to 30 km?</p>
              <p>Oh yes.I am waiting for u to tell me.</p>
              <p>I remember ADF did not mention the concept of Layers</p>
              <p>Defence.The ocean is their Great Wall lah!!</p>
              <p>Why do they need layers of defence?</p>
              <p>U guys just very kind to say for them.</p>
              <p>some of u say SG need heavy AA becos SG is small</p>
              <p>and congested.Have u forget oz also get cities?</p>
              <p>One city in Oz easily gets 3 million population.</p>

              <p>our High-to-Medium<br>altitude Air Defence (HIMAD) missile system,<br>the Improved-HAWK (I-HAWK) formed the<br>second, and</p>
              <p>our Short-Ranged Air Defence<br>(SHORAD) systems such as the Rapier, RBS-<br>70, and Mistral SAMs formed the third.</p>

              <p>Your english comprehension fail ah?</p>
              <p>Do you even know what defence in depth is?</p>
              <p>The Australian kind of defence is prehaps one of the ULTIMATE examples in the region of air defence in DEPTH.</p>
              <p>The Australians have a buffer zone of 500 KILOMETERS  to respond to any enemy threat with.</p>
              <p>It is the Singaporean defence that is the one that lacks depth</p>

              <p>some of u say SG need heavy AA becos SG is small</p>
              <p>and congested.Have u forget oz also get cities?</p>
              <p>One city in Oz easily gets 3 million population.</p>
              <p>Few bombs dropped will cause lot of problems.</p>
              </blockquote>
              <p>WRONG, SG needs heavy AA because there is no place to put out a defence. If you want to defend something the best option is to keep the enemy AWAY from the city in the first place, and this is what the Australians are doing.</p>
              <p>In short, our kind of air defence is practically a point defence network... in short the LAST option you want to resort to when planning for air defence.</p>
              <p>BTW, if we don't have air superiority no matter how many guns or SAMs we put bombs and missiles are going to get through our IADS network, there is no question about it. Our network is only there to reduce the damage, not to stop it entirely.</p>
              <p>In an era of smart standoff weapons and electronic warfare, IADS networks are vulnerable to penetration to such means. Hence the best option is still to stop the enemy from reaching in the first place, if they can reach your SAMs and guns you are already in a very bad state.</p>
              <p>So you are suggesting the Australians divert their funds from actually having an effective air defence solution in JORN standoff to your last-ditch idea?</p>
              <p>Wow, how logical...</p>

              <p>WRONG, what we are saying is that no one CAN knock on Oz's door EASILY.</p>
              <p>Trying to attack Australia has plenty of natural difficulties that any hostile airforce has to overcome.</p>
              <p>PS. It's not that difficult to relocate planes across Australia FIY, they're done this plenty of times. You are trying to invent problems and questions without even bothering to see the facts before you make them... wow...</p>
              <p>And why fly there in combat load when your combat load is waiting for you there?</p>
              <p>Isn't it obvious why they are spending billions on their military? In fact you even made a big hoo ha about it in when they got their "mini-cv".</p>
              <p>They want to power project.</p>
