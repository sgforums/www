              <p>I'm waiting for his next EPIC slipup, while he does make rather funny mistakes practically all of the time, the funniest and most epic was when he was caught using clones after just a few posts, his panicked and anyhow wack reactions after having being caught red handed was priceless.</p>
              <p>Best part, he even tried to accuse me of framing him for using clones, then he changed his story, and then changed it again. In the end he dissappeared for a while to calm himself down giving everyone a few days of peace, and when he returned he was a lot less noisy then before.</p>
              <p>LOL, now that was funny.</p>

              <blockquote>Air Vice Marshal Deeble—I believe we have schedule risk associated with the program. Next week will help me confirm exactly where I sit with the radar, which will bound my overall problem space. What I have told Chief of Air Force and CDF is that I believe that we could, if we worked through some of these significant<br>issues, look at<span style="color: #ff0000;"> initial operational capability</span> at around the end of<span style="color: #ff0000;"> 2011</span> and a<span style="color: #ff0000;"> full operational capability around 2012</span>—assuming that there is some risk that will be realised in the not-too-distant future. That is what my<br>current planning base is. I do not want to set expectations that I cannot achieve. I have significant technical risks in the case of the MESA radar, which will really bound that problem for me.</blockquote>

              <p>the risk most projects in the eyes of DMO</p>
              <p>and the concerns of the MESA radar</p>
              <blockquote>
              <p>what are the five worst projects on your books, by risk, that give you the<br>most concern?<br>Mr Gillis—On 4 June you asked a very similar question, and Dr Gumley gave the response of Wedgetail,<br>HF Mod, Vigilaire, Tiger and Super Seasprites, in addition to the M113s.</p>
              </blockquote><blockquote>Mr King—Likewise, Senator. I would say that our No. 1 priority is AEW&amp;C—that is, the airborne earlywarning aircraft. It has been the subject, obviously, of a number of questions at these committee hearings and<br>in the public domain. I have Air Vice Marshal Deeble, who is the program manager, here with me. Would you<br>like an update on these five programs?<br>Senator JOHNSTON—I would very much like an update.<br>Mr King—This program will deliver the military a very highly capable aircraft, one that we have not had before. It is not a replacement capability; it is a new capability. With that comes a range of technical challenges, as you are aware. I will ask the Air Vice Marshal to give you a quick update on the program and<br>the latest actions we are taking to keep that on track for the future.</blockquote><blockquote><br>Air Vice Marshal Deeble—The Wedgetail program remains a very complex technical program. My primary concern at the moment is the performance of the MESA radar. It is a multirole, electronically scanned<br>array. <span style="color: #ff0000;">We are in the middle of trying to baseline the current performance of the radar with Boeing and Northrop Grumman prior to entry into formal acceptance testing of that particular system.</span><br>Over recent months we have started discrete testing in an acceptance testing context for parts of the aircraft,but radar, of course, is the primary sensor and is the one that is causing us concern at the moment with respect<br>to its current performance. That baselining activity will take some time. It will require us to test the radar in a number of different domains, predominantly in the Canadian and continental US arenas,<span style="color: #ff0000;"> to confirm that<br>baseline performance and then be able to determine whether we are at a sufficient level of maturity. Maturityfor the radar is going to be made up of performance, whether it meets its performance specification, and<br>stability, whether it meets a normal mission requirement</span>. We are conducting operational assessments as we go through that baselining activity. As we determine a level of performance, we then look at what that means in<br>the operational context. That activity is ongoing: by the end of this year I envisage I will have a very good handle on exactly what the radar will do, what shortfalls it may have, what the operational implications are<br>and, hopefully, a path forward agreed with Boeing at that point in time.<br>I have recently written to Boeing about our ongoing concerns with the technical performance of the radar<br>and we are working through those issues with Boeing as we speak. I will be in Seattle next week to work through those issues quite specifically with them. The questions I have asked of them are about what they<br>believe the current baseline performance to be; what action they will take to remediate any shortfalls in performance and, if there are residual shortfalls, how we will work together to understand what those shortfalls<br>are and how we would go about resolving them. At this point in time the radar is at a critical juncture. It is the primary sensor.<br>Senator JOHNSTON—This MESA radar is manufactured by whom?<br>Air Vice Marshal Deeble—Northrop Grumman Corporation.</blockquote>

              <blockquote>Senator JOHNSTON—Northrop Grumman. Who else is using this radar in the same sensing role that we anticipate using it?<br>Air Vice Marshal Deeble—<span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">We are the first customer</span></span> of this particular radar. The AEWAC capability is the first of type.<br>Senator JOHNSTON—Yes.<br>Air Vice Marshal Deeble—The same radar is also going to be installed on the Turkish aircraft currently undergoing flight test in the US. I think there may be an aircraft flying in Turkey as we speak. That is the sameradar.<br>Senator JOHNSTON—<span style="color: #ff0000;">Is their radar operational?<br>Air Vice Marshal Deeble—Their radar is very much reliant on us resolving those issues. We are the first customer. </span>A lot of the testing that we are conducting will confirm baseline performance for those other nations.<br>Korea is also on contract for this capability, and it is the same radar that is inherent in the Korean aircraft—what they term their EX program.<br>Senator JOHNSTON—But we are at the head of the queue?<br>Air Vice Marshal Deeble—<span style="color: #ff0000;">We are at the head of the queue.</span><br>Senator JOHNSTON—Very good. I am sorry I interrupted; please continue.<br>Air Vice Marshal Deeble—That is okay. <span style="color: #ff0000;">The ESM—electronic support measure</span>s, the ability to passively determine what is occurring in the electromagnetic arena around the aircraft—is also another system that we<br>are working on closely. BAE Systems Australia is currently responsible as a subcontractor to Boeing for the provision of that system. We have been working closely with Boeing to understand exactly where we are. I did<br>discuss that particular system last time I was at Senate estimates. That is one of the reasons we are looking<span style="color: #ff0000;"> at an incremental delivery</span>—that has been offered by Boeing. That system has lagged in its development. I think<br>we are at the cusp of being able to resolve those issues. <span style="color: #ff0000;">We will have to conduct further developmental tests and evaluation to determine what those system issues are and what the integrated system performance will be.</span><br>Senator JOHNSTON—That BAE ESM system is called what?<br>Air Vice Marshal Deeble—It is the ALR 2001, a variant of the 2001. That system was developed by an Israeli company, Elta Systems. <span style="color: #ff0000;">BAE Systems Austra</span>lia has them on subcontract to provide that system.<br>Senator JOHNSTON—Where else is that system deployed in the configuration where we would wish to deploy it?<br>Air Vice Marshal Deeble—<span style="color: #ff0000;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">There is no other system out t</span>here that is deployed in the same configuration.<br>We are a very significant modification of the ALR 2001. That system is currently resident in the AP3C but we have expanded those capabilities in the AEWAC context.</span></blockquote>
