              <p>1) water tunnel and wind tunnel serve similar engineering purposes u moron.</p>
              <p>http://www.answers.com/topic/water-tunnel-hydrodynamic</p>
              <blockquote>
              <p>A <strong>water tunnel</strong> is an experimental facility used for testing the <a class="ilnk" href="http://www.answers.com/topic/hydrodynamics">hydrodynamic</a> behavior of submerged bodies in flowing water. <strong>It is very similar to a recirculating <a class="ilnk" href="http://www.answers.com/topic/wind-tunnel">wind
              tunnel</a> but with water as the working fluid, and related phenomena are investigate</strong>d, such as measuring the forces on scale
              models of <a class="ilnk" href="http://www.answers.com/topic/submarine">submarines</a> or lift and drag on <a class="ilnk" href="http://www.answers.com/topic/hydrofoil">hydrofoils</a>. <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Water
              tunnels are sometimes used in place of wind tunnels to perform measurements because techniques like <a class="ilnk" href="http://www.answers.com/topic/particle-image-velocimetry">PIV</a> are easier to implement in water. </strong></span>For many cases as long as the <a class="ilnk" href="http://www.answers.com/topic/reynolds-number-2">Reynolds number</a> is equivalent, the results are valid, whether a submerged water vehicle model is tested
              in air or an aerial vehicle is tested in water. For low Reynolds number flows, tunnels can be made to run oil instead of water.
              The advantage is that the increased <a class="ilnk" href="http://www.answers.com/topic/viscosity">kinematic viscosity</a> will allow the flow to be a faster
              speed (and thus easier to maintain stably) for a lower Reynolds number.</p>
              <p>Whereas in wind tunnels the driving force is usually sophisticated multiblade <a class="ilnk" href="http://www.answers.com/topic/propeller">propellers</a> with adjustable <a class="ilnk" href="http://www.answers.com/topic/blade-pitch">blade pitch</a>, in<strong> water and oil tunnels the fluid is circulated with pumps,
              effectively using a net <a class="ilnk" href="http://www.answers.com/topic/fluid-pressure">pressure head</a> difference to move the fluid rather than imparting
              <a class="ilnk" href="http://www.answers.com/topic/momentum-2">momentum</a> on it directly</strong>. Thus the return section of water and oil tunnels <strong>does not need any
              flow managemen</strong>t; typically it is just a<strong> pipe sized for the pump and desired flow speed</strong>s. The upstream section of a water tunnels
              generally consists of a pipe (outlet from the pump) with several holes along its side and with the end open followed by a series
              of coarse and fine screens to even the flow before the contraction into the test section. Wind tunnels may also have screens
              before the contraction, but in water tunnels they may be as fine as the screen used in window openings and screen doors.</p>
              </blockquote>
              <p>so going by your logic, NUS must be stupid to invest in a wind tunnel since water tunnels have some inherent benefits over wind tunnels ?</p>
              <p>use abit of brain first. different types of systems, different aims and purpose. u cant compare lemons and apples that simply. one must look at the characteristics and then compare from there,</p>
              <p>and how does a car making capability relate to m113 upgrades ?</p>
              <p>SG is light years ahead of AUS military ? quantify. remember AUSTRALIA now has the world's most deadliest frigates. what does sg have ? 6 formidable class without their seahawks. which means we just about have ASW operating  at a substantially degraded capability.</p>
              <p>and in relativity. answer the qn about mk47 and SCAR/ELGM and FN2000/ELGM. dont know, dont talk nonsense.</p>
              <p>ANSWER the existing qns.</p>
              <p>oh btw, whats a queene ? i m still eagerly awaiting your answer on that.</p>

              <p>Aeronautical engineers at the NASA Dryden Flight Research Center
                      often use water to help make aircraft fly more efficiently and safer.</p>
              <p>The water is used in a closed-circuit Flow Visualization Facility
                      (FVF) commonly called "the water tunnel." The facility helps engineers
                      understand the <strong>characteristics and effects of air flowing over and past
                      an aircraft or an aircraft component by using water to simulate ai</strong>r.
                      The water flow patterns are studied and recorded in nearly the same way
                      that wind tunnels are used.</p>
              <p>Water tunnels have become a very useful diagnostic tool in the
                      development of advanced technology aircraft. Although the FVF is much
                      smaller than most wind tunnels, it can produce three dimensional test
                      results which compare well to actual flight data, but at a much lower
                      cost than a wind tunnel and the FVF tests can be conducted in
                      considerably less time.</p>
              <p>Water tunnels such as the one at Dryden are used as a "first step"
                      in providing important information about anomalies and phenomena
                      revealed in wind tunnel tests or in actual flight tests. Water tunnels
                      are also used to study and improve new aircraft and hardware designs.
                      After test results are studied carefully and understood, possible
                      configuration changes on the full-size aircraft can then be considered.</p>
              <p>To observe the flow fields and vortices created in the water tunnel,
                      <strong>colored dye is injected into the moving water from tiny ports on
                      aircraft models and models of flight hardware. The dye creates a visual
                      three-dimensional image of vortices and flow fields around the test
                      object that can be photographed and recorded on video cameras for
                      subsequent studies.</strong> Laser light sheets and shadowgraphs are also used
                      to accommodate photography and video taping in the FVF.</p>
              <p>Most of the tests conducted in the FVF have been to study<strong> aerodynamics associated with high-angle-of-attack research such as
                      determining the strength and location of vortex flows at various flight
                      attitudes</strong>. Angle of attack (AOA) refers to the angle of an aircraft's
                      wings or fuselage relative to the direction in which the aircraft is
                      moving through the air. Wings produce less lift as AOA increases and
                      soon an aircraft can easily become uncontrollable. NASA studies
                      involving high AOA sought better means of controllability at extreme
                      angles of attack. At Dryden, the FVF contributed significantly to the
                      early development of AOA research projects.</p>
              <p>Among the aeronautical projects the FVF has supported are the F-18
                      High Angle of Attack Research Vehicle (HARV), the F-8 Oblique Wing
                      research aircraft, the Space Shuttle, the Air Force YF-22, the X-33,
                      the SR-71, hypersonic vehicle research in which speeds of over Mach 4
                      were simulated, vortex studies on F-14, F-15, and F-16 aircraft, and
                      high AOA studies of vertical/short takeoff and landing (V/STOL)
                      aircraft.</p>
              <p>The facility was used to support the Space Shuttle drag chute
                      verification program at Dryden, and also to study flow fields on
                      lifting body models during development of the X-38. The X-38 was the
                      proposed space station crew return vehicle that incorporated the
                      wingless lifting body concept.</p>
              <p>Other uses of the FVF include flow field studies of flight hardware
                      such as pylons, air probes, antennas, and other similar fixtures that
                      would disturb airflow during flight. The FVF has also been useful in
                      helping to determine the best locations for smoke emission devices on a
                      research aircraft being used for in-flight atmospheric flow
                      visualization studies.</p>
              <h3>FVF Description and Operation</h3>
              <p>Dryden's FVF was built by NASA in 1983 and is patterned after the
                      Northrop Corporation water tunnel in Hawthorne, Calif. It was designed
                      to consume a minimum of floor space, a factor that resulted in a
                      vertical orientation of the facility's three main structural components
                      -- a vertical test section, a horizontal test section, and the settling
                      tank. The other main component is the pumping system located at ground
                      level.</p>
              <p>The vertical test section is a four-sided chamber 6 feet high, 16
                      inches deep and 24 inches wide. It is constructed of 2-inch clear
                      acrylic plastic on all sides so that tests can be observed from nearly
                      all angles. A round 16-inch door on the outboard 24-inch side gives
                      personnel access to the interior for model mounting and test
                      preparation.</p>
              <p>The horizontal test section is 77.5 inches high and 24 inches wide.
                      Visual and physical access to the horizontal unit is limited because
                      the top of the chamber is more than 15 feet above the floor and access
                      must be from above. The horizontal chamber is very suitable as either a
                      free-surface channel or as a water table by using a sluice gate on the
                      "upstream" end of the section. The distance the sluice gate is open,
                      combined with adjusted pump speed, can adjust the flow rate. During
                      shadowgraph photography in the horizontal chamber, conditions
                      simulating supersonic and hypersonic speeds can be created and studied.</p>
              <p>The largest part of the FVF is the 15.5-foot high, 24-foot wide
                      stainless steel settling tank. When the FVF is operating, a 15-hp
                      electric centrifugal pump sends water into the bottom portion of the
                      settling tank through a 12-inch pipe. The water enters the settling
                      tank through a series of small holes drilled around the perimeter of
                      the entry pipe to reduce turbulence created by the pumping action.</p>
              <p>Pumping action forces the water to rise and flow across the upper
                      portion of the settling tank into a smaller horizontal section where it
                      passes through two honeycomb flow straighteners that stabilize the flow
                      and eliminates turbulence. The horizontal test section is that portion
                      of the upper channel between the two flow straighteners.</p>
              <p>After passing through the horizontal section, water flows down past
                      a third honeycomb straightener and enters the vertical test section.
                      The water exits the bottom of the test section through an 8-inch return
                      pipe and is carried back to the centrifugal pump for continuous
                      recirculation. On the "upstream" side of the pump is a diatomaceous
                      earth filter that constantly cleanses the water. The velocity rate of
                      the water can be varied from 2 to 10 in. per second, based on the type
                      of test being carried out. Experience has shown that a velocity rate of
                      slightly more than 3 in. per second generally provides the best
                      visualization results, with minimal water turbulence, for most tests.</p>
              <h3>Test Models</h3>
              <p>Models used in the FVF are typically scaled 1/32 and 1/48.
                      Commercial plastic model kits are often used if a model of the real
                      aircraft associated with the test project is available. Commercial
                      plastic models are excellent tools for use in the FVF because they are
                      usually very accurate in depicting design configurations and their
                      price tags helps keep operational costs low. The loads on the models
                      created by the dynamic pressure of the water are low and eliminate the
                      danger of breakage in most cases.</p>
              <p>The model kits are assembled in the Dryden model shop where
                      technicians carefully prepare their surfaces to assure that test data
                      isn't compromised by imperfections. The models are supported inside the
                      test chamber by an attachment called a sting.</p>
              <p>Once model shop technicians identify where the dye injections lines
                      are located they are installed before assembly is complete. The
                      external ports must be flush with the model's surface so the flow of
                      the dye will not affect the model's flow field.</p>
              <p>On most models of jet aircraft tested in the FVF the engine inlets
                      are open and water is allowed to enter to create the simulation of mass
                      flow through the engine or engines. The water passes through the inlet
                      and is then ducted away from the test section so it doesn't disturb the
                      flow field. During tests where water flows into the inlets, the flow
                      rates in the test chamber and the inlet are carefully coordinated to
                      correspond to specific flight conditions.</p>
              <p>Engine exhaust streams are also modeled in the same fashion by
                      ducting water from outside the test chamber into the model and out the
                      exhaust outlet. Water flow in the test chamber and inside the model is
                      coordinated much like the inlet flow to correspond to realistic flight
                      conditions.</p>
              <p>Model shop craftsmen also make models of specialized test hardware
                      and components when they are not available from another source, such as
                      pylons, air probes, antennas, and other fixtures that would disturb
                      airflow during flight.</p>

              <p>The size of the models tested in the FVF are limited by the
                      dimensions of the test chambers, but researchers prefer large models
                      over small ones because they usually yield more accurate test data and
                      visual flow details are more easily studied.</p>
              <p>Most of the tests carried out in the FVF are for visual purposes and
                      still photos and videotape are the primary means of acquiring visual
                      documentation of tests results. The video system, using _-in. tape,
                      includes a text generator that creates title screens and displays test
                      conditions. A video screen splitter allows the camera to record the
                      platform of the test article and side views simultaneously.</p>
              <p>Model positioning in the FVF is controlled by a computerized system
                      that includes a motion controller, servomotors, a joystick, and a model
                      support arm inside the test chamber. A model's angle of attack and yaw
                      angle (in relation to the direction of water flow) can be adjusted by
                      either moving the joystick or by entering the desired position into the
                      computer. As position inputs are made, a character generator linked to
                      the video camera system records the new position on videotape. A
                      typical model 18-in.long will have an angle-of-attack range of -30
                      degrees to +90 degrees. The yaw angle will usually be limited to about
                      15 degrees because of wingspans.</p>
              <h3>Dye Injection System</h3>
              <p>The use of colored dye is the most common means of producing flow
                      visualization in the FVF. It is commercial vegetable-based food
                      coloring found in most any grocery store.</p>
              <p>The dye is emitted into the water from flush ports, external tubes,
                      probes or any other means that will allow it to be captured by the flow
                      field being studied.</p>
              <p>A system of six pressurized dye containers is mounted on the outside
                      of the test section. Each can hold a different color and the rate of
                      flow at each container are controlled by individual needle valves. Dye
                      feed lines from the containers are placed in the test chambers and
                      attached to the models in the vertical test section through the side
                      door.</p>
              <p>Individual test requirements determine how the dye lines are
                      configured and how many are used. Each dye line can be routed to many
                      smaller lines through a manifold system. <strong>Tests in the FVF have seen as
                      many as 120 dye lines being used simultaneously.</strong></p>
              <h3>Laser Light Sheets</h3>
              <p>Laser light sheets are used to visualize the cross section of a flow
                      field. Either fluorescent dyes or a particulate such as aluminum powder
                      is placed in the flow field "upstream" to act as a tracer element. A
                      thin but broad sheet of laser light is used to illuminate the tracer
                      element at a particular location in the flow field, based on test
                      requirements.</p>
              <p>The tracer elements give off a brilliant pattern in the flow field as the laser light sheets illuminate them.</p>
              <p>During the tests, <strong>the laser light sheets can be moved and scanned
                      across the model, they can be oriented vertically or horizontally, and
                      are easily photographed or recorded on videotape.</strong></p>
              <h3>Shadowgraph Photography</h3>
              <p>The horizontal test chamber is normally used for tests that call for
                      a free surface water table where conditions will allow simulated
                      supersonic and hypersonic speeds to be visually recorded.</p>
              <p>For these tests, two-dimension models are placed on the bottom of
                      the test chamber that is painted white. Cameras and lights are placed
                      above the test chamber. The flow rate is controlled by placement of the
                      sluice gate and a coordinated pump speed. Shadows of waveforms --
                      analogous to atmospheric shock waves -- are created on the chamber
                      floor by overhead lighting and can be easily photographed.</p>
              <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Simulated Mach numbers of 4.10 have been created in the horizontal
                      test chamber during past studies of high-speed flight vehicles.</strong></span></p>
              <h3>FVF Benefits</h3>
              <p>The Dryden FVF has become a <strong>convenient, inexpensive, and accurate
                      research tool for project personnel who need to study fluid dynamics
                      phenomena in connection with advanced technology vehicles</strong>, especially
                      those associated with high angle-of-attack flight.</p>
              <p>The facility allows flow field visualization and interpretation in a
                      timely and cost-effective environment, factors that are becoming
                      increasingly important as aerospace vehicles become more complex and
                      expensive.</p>
              <p>Advancements in model construction and instrumentation, along with
                      increased knowledge of the behavior of fluids, will give the Dryden FVF
                      an even more important role in NASA's quest to keep the United States
                      at the forefront of world aviation</p>

              <p>yea sure, i am pretty sure that water tunnels will "break once they exceed mach1"</p>
              <p>- depends on design, pump, return system of individual water tunnel.</p>
              <p>-cheaper, affordable, accurate</p>
              <p>-cost-effective</p>
              <p>-use of dye allows multiple variables to be tracked and studied. easy visual referencing and understanding as well.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>how how how lionnoisy ? seems like you are WRONG again. it really depends on the water tunnel design, but if the NASA one can go up to 4.1 mach as well in testing. why not the australian one ?</p>
              <p>its an inherent potential within to reach that capability. whethjer it reaches the capability or not is a matter of design and engineering.</p>
              <p>admit it lionnoisy. u posted the water tunnel thing without knowing what you were saying.</p>

              <blockquote>
              <p>As reported in The Australian last week, the first of six Wedgetails
                  is now not expected to be delivered until late November 2009, <span style="color: #ff0000;">more than
                  28 months </span>behind schedule.</p>
              <p>The Royal Australian Air Force is the<span style="color: #ff0000;"> launch customer for the
                  aircraft</span>, a modified Boeing 737 airliner, six of which were originally

                  management of defence procurements, he warned.</p>
              <p>On a happier note, Mr Combet said he was pleased to see contractual
                  acceptance of the Adelaide Class frigates, HMAS ships Sydney and Darwin<span style="color: #ff0000;"> after years of protracted delays</span>.But it was a near run thing with

              <p>I apologised to other SG people about the synchrotron, SG has one that goes to 700MeV, Australia 3GeV. The strength I don't think is a major issue though.</p>
              <p>No one on this forum ever said Australia was so advanced, it was only ever you and your inferiority complex. Do you have a small dick as well and feel inadequate? LOL</p>
              <p>As for the Wedgetail, it is def not good to see delays. Fortunately, Australia was smarter this time around with the contract signing, so that Boeing has to put up with delay costs.</p>
              <p>Australia is not perfect, but it is striving v hard to become a much more potent military.</p>

              <blockquote>
              <p>The navy's woes are a combination of bad luck, bad management and
              bad timing. Mismanagement of important projects has resulted in the
              planned upgrade of four of the navy's <span style="color: #ff0000;">FFG frigates being delayed by
              almost five years,</span> blowing out the total cost to more than $1.5
              billion. The disastrous <span style="color: #ff0000;">Kaman Seasprite</span> helicopter project finally was
              cancelled by Fitzgibbon in April at a cost to the taxpayer of $1.1
              billion.</p>
              <p>Other weak spots include the <span style="color: #ff0000;">abandonment of plans to upgrade the
              Anzac class </span>frigates into capable air defence platforms and a
              continuing and alarming shortfall in the navy's anti-submarine warfare
              capabilities. "The surface fleet is ill-equipped for high-level
              operations," Davies says.</p>
              <p>But the biggest single challenge to the navy today is not its lack
              of capable equipment but it<span style="color: #ff0000;">s lack of qualified people </span>to operate it.</p>
