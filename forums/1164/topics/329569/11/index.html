              <blockquote><strong><a name="identifying">Identifying 
                              High Risk Programs-the Example of the AEW&amp;C Program</a></strong>
              <p>Indeed, an examination of the AEW&amp;C program shows 
                              that it carries a high level of risk. A characteristic of the development 
                              of uniquely Australian systems, displayed by the Collins, is that their 
                              estimated cost rises steeply between the various developmental stages 
                              of the project. There are significant increases between the approval for 
                              early conceptual studies and the subsequent issue by the project Office 
                              of its preferred specifications, against which equipment providers are 
                              invited to bid. There are further increases between approval by government 
                              of the preferred supplier and the signing of a contract. As the program 
                              cost increases, the date for in-service delivery recedes.</p>
              <p><a name="_Toc525354310"></a><a name="costincreases">Cost Increases in the 
                              AEW&amp;C Project</a></p>
              <p>These stages can be seen clearly in the AEW&amp;C aircraft 
                              program. When project definition studies commenced in 1994, the estimated 
                              cost was $1 billion, with an in-service date of 2000.<sup>(163)</sup> Five years later, when Boeing had been selected to supply the AEW&amp;C 
                              force, the estimated cost had risen to $2 billion to supply seven aircraft, 
                              the first in 2004-05.<sup>(164)</sup> In mid-2000 the project was frozen 
                              pending the completion of the defence white paper because of Cabinet's 
                              concern about the impact of its rising costs on an over-pressured defence 
                              budget. By this time contract negotiations had pushed the total program 
                              cost to $3.4 million.<sup>(165)</sup> The program was approved in the 
                              white paper but for a current approved cost of $3.11 billion it will supply 
                              only four aircraft from 2006 onwards but which will not be operational 
                              until 2008.</p>
              <p>Obviously, the decline in the exchange rate between the 
                              A$ and US$ has contributed something to this increase in cost. However, 
                              during the period from mid-1994 to December 2000, the A$ has lost just 
                              under 19 per cent against the US$,<sup>(166)</sup> clearly less than the 
                              increased cost of the AEW&amp;C project. Furthermore, the variability 
                              of exchange rates against the US$ has significance which goes beyond the 
                              issue of costs.</p>

                              Program</a></p>
              <p>The AEW&amp;C program is open to the risks of other struggling 
                              defence acquisition programs. Four million lines of software code unique 
                              to Australia will have to be written for its electronic systems. Australia 
                              has no domestic operational experience to assist the development program 
                              and the user organisation, No 2 Squadron, is being created within the 
                              Project Office. The AEW&amp;C is currently an orphan system. Australia 
                              was the first and remains the only customer for the Boeing design. The 
                              hope was that it offered sufficient advances to be purchased by other 
                              nations, thus spreading development costs and creating a market big enough 
                              to justify Boeing's continued support of the system into the future.</p>
              <p>At one stage Turkey was to be a customer but a combination 
                              of severe currency devaluation and contract disputes are likely to prevent 
                              an order for some time.<sup>(167)</sup> Indeed, it is a problem that the 
                              Boeing aircraft is aimed at countries needing a cheaper alternative to 
                              the more complex early warning aircraft. Unfortunately, many of these 
                              are also amongst those countries whose currencies are more likely to devalue 
                              against the American dollar, making the system less affordable.</p>
              <p>Although over countries (South Korea has been mentioned) 
                              will probably buy some of the aircraft, it is not yet established that 
                              the numbers sold will be sufficient for Boeing to afford an ongoing program 
                              of system development. Managing the AEW&amp;C program to overcome high 
                              risk factors and avoid their financial implications is likely to remain 
                              important for the future viability of the Defence Capability Plan.</p>

                                              Ongoing Problems in Defence Procurement</strong>
              <p>Yet, in reality, the Collins submarine program is not amongst
                                              the worst managed by Defence, in terms of either additional costs
                                              or time overrun. At present there are 15 Defence acquisition
                                              programs which have exceeded their approved cost by a combined
                                              total of $568 million...</p>
              <p>Even by the worst interpretation of performance, the Collins
                                              program would rank twelfth amongst these. Many of the programs are
                                              characterised by changes to overseas systems to meet specifications
                                              developed by the Australian Defence Force (ADF) for peculiarly
                                              Australian requirements. These systems are unique to Australia and
                                              typically have proven difficult both to develop and maintain.
                                              Within Defence they have attracted the nickname
                                              <strong><span style="color: #ff0000;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: red;">'orphan
                                              systems'.</span></span></span></strong></p>
              <p>The desire of the ADF to acquire <span style="color: #ff0000;">orphan systems</span> is not 
                              a relic of past decades. It has been shown in the ANZAC class frigate 
                              helicopter program, for which the platform was selected in 1997 and for 
                              which the avionics system is two years late. It is a danger which must 
                              be managed in the Airborne Early Warning and Control (AEW&amp;C) program, 
                              the contract for which was signed in December 2000, and for which four 
                              million lines of unique software are needed. It is also a risk inherent 
                              in the Government's new approach to the Collins class combat system.</p>
              <p>Neither is it a problem whose effects are confined to 
                              the programs themselves. Were, for arguments sake, the AEW&amp;C program 
                              to require additional funding to the same extent as the Collins program, 
                              it would cost an extra $600 million. Such unprogrammed expenditure would 
                              be sufficient to jeopardise the orderly development of the ADF as planned 
                              in <em>Defence 2000</em>, the defence white paper.</p>
              </blockquote><blockquote><strong><a name="poor">Poor 
                              Management and the 'Orphan Systems' Syndrome</a></strong>
              <p>On this scale then, the consequences of poor financial 
                              management of defence projects must be a concern. At their root, many 
                              of them suffer from the same problems as the submarine program. In common 
                              with the Collins submarines these struggling projects exhibit two critical 
                              characteristics. They have all incorporated significant changes to what 
                              appears to be reasonably suitable military technology, to specifications 
                              which Defence claimed were necessary to meet peculiarly Australian requirements. 
                              Typically, these changes result in uniquely Australian systems which prove 
                              difficult to develop and maintain. Most commonly this syndrome, which 
                              again is typical of the Collins submarine program, affects electronic 
                              systems. In Defence such programs are known as 'orphan systems' since 
                              they have no close equivalents in the world.</p>
              <p>Neither is the Collins program a relic of a previous 
                              age when defence project management was less sophisticated. Defence procurement 
                              programs of a much more recent vintage than the submarines are in equal 
                              or more difficulty.</p>

              <p> a  few simple home truths here lionnoisy.</p>
              <p>1) no weapons procurement system or process is without flaws</p>
              <p>2) no weapon system is without flaws</p>
              <p>3) STK weapons are not best in the world /universe/galaxy. PERIOD.</p>
              <p>4) different expectations/ needs = different procurement requirements and methods</p>
              <p>5) we cant evaluate whether procurement is ideal or not, but we can critically examine the cause and effect of procurement. which is something you havent been doing.</p>
              <p>to critically examine means to try to fit everything within the context (i.e Australia's shoes) you have simply been bashing them without making an effort to UNDERSTAND them.</p>

              <blockquote>
              <p>The stand-down period will run from December 3 to February 3, and will be a permanent arrangement every year.</p>
              <p>This
              Christmas 500 navy personnel will remain deployed overseas and in
              waters north of Australia. If an emergency occurs, other personnel will
              be ordered back to work.</p>
              <p>But thousands of sailors who might
              previously have been deployed on ships over December and January on
              exercises or training activities will not be this year, and will be
              able to take longer than usual holidays.</p>
              <p>The extraordinary
              measures are a part of an initiative called "New Generation Navy" aimed
              at attracting and retaining more staff by changing the culture of the
              navy and improving the work-life balance of personnel.</p>
              <p>The navy
              loses 11 per cent of its workforce every year and last financial year
              only achieved 73 per cent of its full-time recruitment targets.</p>
              <div id="contentSwap2" class="pageprint" style="display: none;"><a name="contentSwap2"></a>
              <p>The Chief of Navy, Vice Admiral Russ Crane, told the <em>Herald</em> "this program is about, where I can, providing an opportunity for our people to have a good break.</p>
              <p>"This
              is about generating some space and taking advantage of an opportunity
              for [personnel] to be able to have a bit of time to spend with their
              families at home, a bit of time to spend with their mates."</p>
              <p>He added: "It's about getting a culture in place that's about working smarter not harder, and I think we owe that to our people.</p>
              <p>"By doing that I believe we can significantly reduce some of the separation rates we're seeing at the moment."</p>
              <p>Leading Seaman Christine van Lieshout is a mother of three whose husband is also in the navy.</p>
              <p>She believes the new Christmas arrangements will be "fantastic".</p>
              <p>A
              reservist at navy headquarters at Russell in Canberra, Leading Seaman
              van Lieshout recalls spending Christmas in 2003 alone with her children
              because her husband, a chief petty officer, was on deployment to
              Christmas Island.</p>
              <p>"That was pretty horrible," she said. "We were
              basically watching everyone else with their families … we received a
              phone call late in the afternoon from him and that was Christmas."</p>
              <p>This
              year Leading Seaman van Lieshout and her husband, Rodney, will both go
              on leave on December 19, and will spend the holidays with their
              children Daniel, 16, Ashley, 11, and Stephanie, 13.</p>
              <p>Her husband
              has just returned from a six-month deployment in the Gulf, during which
              time he missed his children's birthdays, Father's Day and a
              confirmation.</p>
              <p>"The children have not had an opportunity to see
              their dad very much, so having the opportunity to have Rodney home a
              lot longer is fantastic because it gives them bonding time and takes a
              bit of pressure off me."</p>
              <p>She said the  initiatives were "fantastic for a lot of people".</p>

              <p>The upgrade of four guided missile frigates might be four years late but, experts say, the navy now has the most lethal frigate fleet on earth.</p>
              <p>That has caught the attention of several overseas navies, including the US, Canada, Greece and Turkey, which could send their FFGs to the Sydney shipyard of French giant Thales for a similar overhaul.</p>
              <p>In January this year <em>The Daily Telegraph </em>revealed the parlous state of the $1.4 billion project and major problems with electronic combat and self-protection systems.</p>
              <p>Just 10 months - and several key staff changes - later the huge high-tech challenges have been overcome and yesterday HMAS Sydney and HMAS Darwin were handed back to the navy for final trials.</p>
              <p>Parliamentary Secretary for Defence and driving force behind the reversal Greg Combet said he was "very pleased" with the outcome.</p>
              <p>"These FFGs will be advanced warships and hopefully we will get one to the Gulf next year to relieve the Anzac frigates," Mr Combet said.</p>
              <p>The ships have been virtually re-built and fitted with highly capable missile and combat systems and new radars and sonars. Some involve more than a million lines of software code.</p>
              <p>Chief executive of Thales Australia Chris Jenkins said the upgrade was the most complex in naval history.</p>
              <p>"These are the most capable ships in the history of the RAN," he said.</p>
              <p>The upgrade was a testimony to the skills available in Australia, he said.</p>
              <p>"Building new ships is so much easier than upgrading operational assets. It is very challenging," he said.</p>
              <p>Commodore Drew McKinnie of the Defence Materiel Organisation said the handover was "momentous".</p>

              <blockquote>
              <p>We found antennas with a physical leak in them; the antennas
                                      have been replaced<br> by the company.</p>
              <p>We found hardware deficiencies.</p>
              <p>We found some mounting deficiencies.</p>
              <p>We found some software deficiencies. I might add that through
                                      this detailed analysis</p>
              <p>we also found, surprisingly perhaps, some deficiencies on fitted
                                      equipment that has been there for quite some time which generated
                                      spike. It was a very thorough trials process.</p>

              <p>Dumb lion, have you read the date of my article vs your articles? My article was published on the  19th November 2008.</p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">The "sources" you refer to are months to years old.  I know you're mentally retarded, but please try to catch up with the present.</span></p>
              <p>Next year, one of the ships is being deployed ACTIVELY. So stuff your operational capabilities BS talk. These ships will be used for what they're supposed to do .</p>
              <p>Did the FFG upgrade have problems? Yes. But now look at what we have got.  I'm astonished you didn't even bother to read the article.</p>
