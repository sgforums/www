            <div class='col-md body'>Those mainlanders are a bunch of cocky little bastards, aren't they?<br><br>Hmmm - let's see.  The CEP of the American Peacemaker is 100 metres, while the CEP for the Chinese Ju Lang 2 and Dong Feng 31 missiles is anything up to 300 metres.  As a rough measure, you would need 10 Chinese warheads to have the same effect as one American warhead.<br><br>Bottom line, losing all cities east of Xian is an estimate so optimistic as to border on manic.  Even if the Chinese get the first shot off, a nuclear shootout would mean that all Chinese cities, not just east but west, north and south of Xian are going to be turned to ashtrays.  Mind you, that's without factoring the US Navy's SLBM capability into the equation.<br><br>As for the issue of shooting down a reentry vehicle, it's a matter of speed.  An MIRV travels in excess of 24,000 km/h.  The PAC-3 is designed to intercept tactical ballistic missiles travelling at about a quarter of that speed.<br><br>That said, the critical factor here is that the missile travels towrads its target instead of chasing after it, so the speed of the PAC-3 is not a deal-breaker here.  More importantly, it's the speed at which the trajectory of the missile and target, and the precise point of the PAC-3 warhead's detonation, can be calculated .<br><br>The trouble they had with the original Patriot's 24-bit guidance system was that it was about 0.34 seconds slow in making its decisions.  However, it is essentially a software problem.  It's only a matter of time before they get their algorithms correct and improve the software so that it can intercept an MIRV - with a range of 100 km, the PAC-3 has more than enough range to catch a MIRV reentering the atmosphere.</div>

Now I can even more politely to tell you, sorry, you can not use this range on the Tactical Ballistic Missile(TBM), which is interceptable by PAC-3  , For such missile, according to the PAC-3 data, itÂ’s engagement range is much shortened to 30km, for a  even higher speed ICBM? You judge how should this range be even shortened again if I also wild minded enough to agree on your  Â“PAC-3 interception ICBM dream.Â”</strong><br><br>For your info, all the US official documents  clearly define the PAC-3 is for low tier TBM defense.

These are historically called atom bombs or A-bombs, though this name is not precise due to the fact that chemical reactions release energy from atomic bonds too, and fusion is no less atomic than fission. Despite this possible confusion, the term atom bomb has still been generally accepted to refer specifically to nuclear weapons, and most commonly to pure fission devices.<br><br>In general, fission bombs are powered by using <strong>chemical explosives </strong>to compress a sub-critical amount of either uranium-235 or plutonium into a dense, super-critical mass, which is then subjected to a source of neutrons. This begins an uncontrollable nuclear chain reaction, and produces a very large amount of energy. </span><br><br>Now touch the topic: If the Interceptor with 72kg HE traveling @ 5M ( PAC3 grade) hits a even much higher speed MIRV @ 20M( 7km/s), what going to happen?<br><br>A.	The hit and HE explosion wonÂ’t cause the Chemical Explosive in the warhead to explode subsequently.<br>B.	The Â“deep impact Â“and high charged explosion will trigger the Chemical explosive in the warhead to explode and subsequently trigger the chain reaction.<br>If the answer is A, pls go back the point 1, If ur answer is B, then agree on my previous post.<br><br><blockquote><br><br>In any case, I said I'm here to chill, shoot the breeze and throw some ideas around, but you just gotta go wetting your pants over something this trivial, don't you?
