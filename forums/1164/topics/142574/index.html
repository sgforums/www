Beijing has long insisted that it will not initiate the use of nuclear weapons in any conflict.</strong><br><br>But in extensive comments to a visiting delegation of correspondents based in Hong Kong, General Zhu said he believed that the Chinese government was under internal pressure to change its "no first use" policy and to make clear that it would employ the most powerful weapons at its disposal to defend its claim over Taiwan.<br><br><strong>"War logic" dictates that a weaker power needs to use maximum efforts to defeat a stronger rival, he said, speaking in fluent English. "We have no capability to fight a conventional war against the United States," General Zhu said. "We can't win this kind of war."</strong><br><br>Whether or not the comments signal a shift in Chinese policy, they come at a sensitive time in relations between China and the United States.<br><br>The Pentagon is preparing the release of a long-delayed report on the Chinese military that some experts say will warn that China could emerge as a strategic rival to the United States. National security concerns have also been a major issue in the $18.5 billion bid by Cnooc Ltd., a major Chinese oil and gas company, to purchase the Unocal Corporation, the American energy concern.<br><br>China has had atomic bombs since 1964 and currently has a small arsenal of land- and sea-based nuclear-tipped missiles that can reach the United States, according to most Western intelligence estimates. Some Pentagon officials have argued that China has been expanding the size and sophistication of its nuclear bombs and delivery systems, while others argue that Beijing has done little more than maintain a minimal but credible deterrent against a nuclear attack.<br><br>Beijing has said repeatedly that it would use military force to prevent Taiwan from becoming a formally independent country. President Bush has made clear that the United States would defend Taiwan.<br><br>Many military analysts have assumed that any battle over Taiwan would be localized, with both China and the United States taking care to ensure that it would not expand into a general war between the two powers.<br><br>But the comments by General Zhu suggest that at least some elements of the military are prepared to widen the conflict, perhaps to persuade the United States that it could no more successfully fight a limited war against China than it could against the former Soviet Union.<br><br><strong>"If the Americans are determined to interfere, then we will be determined to respond," he said. "We Chinese will prepare ourselves for the destruction of all the cities east of Xian.

China has upgraded them from liquid fuel to solid fuel which means they are travelling at Mach speeds.<br>Try stopping a missile when it can split to 13 warheads travelling at Mach speeds.<br><br>And ICBM usually fly up to space near the orbital path where common anti missile can't reach and re-enter the atmosphere at mach speeds to reach it's target.

Lehner said quite simply that Â“this missile defense system being deployed is not a threat to either the Russian or the Chinese strategic deterrent force.Â”<br><br>Lehner accurately presents official policy, but this points to the problem with current policy. It is true that the United States is not seeking to deploy a strategic defense, and that it is specifically avoiding the space-based systems useful to that end. The arms controllers who vehemently opposed ReaganÂ’s Strategic Defense Initiative are therefore wrong to attack the system and policy as such. The systems currently under development would still preserve a policy of mutually assured destruction, permitting enemy missiles to have a Â“free rideÂ” to our territory and citizens.<br><br>The beginning of a limited deployment this year in Alaska and California is an important first step, but it is essential that such deployment be followed up with more ambitious and capable systems. Specifically, the proper direction for future missile defense should be toward space-based interceptors designed to counter the strategic threat posed by Russia and China.</span><br><br>Why should China's Strategy force's missile necessarily over fly Pearl Harbor? WhatÂ’s the purpose for PLA to deploy 094 SSBN? Why the new nuclear Submarine base is built in southern Hainan Island instead of Northern China. ItÂ’s all because such arrangement makes the PLA easily launch an attack from all directions and avoid passing by the Pearl Harbor or Guam where got heavy US force deployment. ThereÂ’r just too many wormholes in the waterway between Taiwan and Philippine  for the modern and quiet 094 SSBN to sneak into vast pacific ocean,  where the SSBN could comfortable find a unnoticed corner and surpass the American BMD mainly existing at north<br><br></div>
