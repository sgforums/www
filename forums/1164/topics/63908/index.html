Wat model , not sure. Basing on the possibility our friend up north will get stand-off anti-ship weapons. A mix of Aster30 and another shorter ranged missile is my preference.<br><br><blockquote>3) would the SSMs be Harpoons or Exocets?</blockquote>Most likely either one of these two. Supersonic missiles and other available SSMs in the market now are rather unproven and unstable plateforms.<br><br><blockquote>4) would it be armed with torpedo decoys?</blockquote>Most likely so. ( My opinion )<br><br><blockquote>5) would it replace the MGBs?</blockquote>Yesh.<br><br><blockquote>6) if so, then would the Gabriel missiles still be in service?</blockquote>Either they armed the Deltas with Gabriel or other similar missiles or they will armed the PVs will Gabriel or other similar missiles. We simply need such missiles in our inventory.<br>[/quote]</div>

In this case 62 times  You take the diameter 76mm * 62 = 4712mm or 4.712 meter.<br><br>For 155mm howitzers,  a 52 calibre barrel is 155mm*52 = 8060mm or 8 metres.<br><br>The longer the barrel, the better combustion of the propellant and better guidance of the projectile.<br><br>Good example is the M16 Commando version, it has a shorter range and accuracy than the standard version.</div>
