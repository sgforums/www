Its been tested before.<br><br>In public, no comments on our "friendly" neighbour.<br><br>Actually you won't use a GPS-guided or even laser-guided bomb on a tank, it is abit too costly, unless absolutely necessary, you would use something more economical. GPS won't be of use, unless you're dropping armour-piercing JDAM.<br><br>There are tanks with warning receivers against lasing, but that's just warning, the only reaction is to try and hide/run, but with modern weapons so fast and able to receive mid-course update, its unlikely they can run fast.</div>
