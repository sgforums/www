The only thing advantage the M1 have over the Leo2 is M1 is the quietest tank in the world .... !!! But then it also got 1 of the major weakness - its burn gas a lot more then leo2  .  The worst nightmare of tankees is have tank but no fuel .<br><br>You are right about the howitzers like Primus tanks .... they nowaday have the ability to attack a tank from a far .... but usually that will still need someone or a UAV to give them a co-ordinate to fire the new anti-tank artillery round to ......  the round when reach the area will activite sensor that detect where the tank is and auto steer itself to it ( the old days they still need someone to aim a laser designator to the tank )  .... the round will impact the tank from the top which is where it is the most thinly armoured.</div>

There are but as some have mentioned, it depends on how you define rifle and how you define tank armour.<br><br>If by rifle you mean a man portable rifle, then historically, there have been plenty of so-called "Anti-Tank Rifles", from small calibres such as the German 7.92mm PanzerbÃ¼chse to the Finnish 20mm Lahti.  These were capable of various levels of penetration but had one common factor ... they were all facing obsolesence by the early years of WW2.<br><br>(you can read more about WW2 ATRs from here http://www.antitank.co.uk/)<br><br>There is a finite limit to how much armour these man portable rifles can penetrate and that limit was reached pretty much in WW2.  Tank armour OTOH has progressed significantly beyond that.<br><br>So comes the second part of defining "tank armour".  If you're talking about an MBT like a Leo 2, then no way in hell.  Unless you want to count in golden BB shots.<br><br>OTOH, an AMX-13 is still considered a tank <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink">  The armour protections on an unmodified AMX-13 can be penetrated by even 12.7mm SLAP (Saboted Light Armour Piercing) rounds.<br><br>Modern 0.50in (12.7mm) sniper rifles are also sometimes called anti-material rifles.  They also commonly have AP rounds available for engaging lightly armoured vehicles such as APCs, Armoured trucks, etc.<br><br>Hope that helps.</strong></div>

AFAIK there is the M995 5.56mm AP round and the M993 7.62mm AP round.  Also IINM, the standard 4.7mm round for the P90 is also of an AP design (if not designation).<br><br>AP rounds for rifle calibres are usually denoted by a black tip on the bullet.  They differ from standard ball rounds in that they usually have a steel (or harder material) penetrator embedded in the bullet core instead of a standard lead core.<br><br>The 0.50in SLAP round is somewhat different in that it is IINM it is more an APDS (Armour Piercing Discarding Sabot) round than a pure AP round.<br><br>+2c<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>on the PT91M new gun<br><br>quote:<br>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>PT-91M has as you know a slovak modernisation of Rapira gun, 2A46MS (modernized,slovak). It has increased hit accuracy by 23%.<br>Better guns i can see only german 120mm L44 or L55, swiss one,russian/ukrainian modernisation or chineese (do not know the name, with increased kinetical energy by 30%). However Bumar Labedy is familiar only with slovak one.<br>So it's too complicated and costly to change the gun. In Poland the programme with 120mm L44 (like in Leopard 2A4) was abandoned.<br>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br><br>Info on the PT91M new round<br><br>quote:<br>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>what we know however, that a military weapon research guys work over new apfsds projectile. next one. this one would have additional charge around the sabot. The apfsds amunition for t-72 is split in two parts, penetrator with sabot and propellant charge. and that's why the length of the penetrator seems to be limited (some say however that loader would accept longer penetrators anyway) and also the amount of propellant is limited. Malaysia bought new APFSDS and now they working on this next - this time the propellant will be in two parts of the amunition - in normal charge and additively around the sabot. So it could achieve biggest speed and biggest penetration.<br>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br><br>quote:<br>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>The additive propellant charge around the sabot is for speed increase. Normally the amunition for T-72 (in oppose to western tanks amunition that is ine one piece) consist of 2 separate parts: propellant and projectile (sabot and penetrator). Normally propellant in one part burns at the moment of opening fire, and the projectile goes out of the barrel, then sabot breaks apart and lonely penetrator flies to the target. But the amount of propellant is limited due to construction of 2-part amunition. Now they want to add the propelant also around projectile - of course it burns also in the moment of opening fire. Two charges of propellant burn, (normal and around the sabot) and projectile leaves the barrel.<br>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br><br>better penetration than the older round<br><br></div>

With extra propellent charges, I can imagine the extra "fling" the turret will have in the event of a catastrophic failure.  Something which T-72 series are quite known for too!</div>
