Did you support the implementation of National Service? Why?<br><br>3. How did other National Service men, like you felt?<br><br>4. How did your family and relatives (others) felt?<br><br>5. Did you do anything to show your dissatisfaction/support? If yes/no, why?<br><br>6. What did other people did to show their support or dissatisfaction?<br><br>7.

            <div class='col-md body'>A lot of the very first batches won't be heavy internet users or forum contributors. If you lower the bracket to 40+'s (served mid-late 70's, early 80s) you might get some responses. Bear in mind the very first batch in 1968 was a very select small batch. Only in the early- to mid- 70's did SAF really get rolling with large numbers of conscripts, once the core local instructor base was in place.  LHL himself enlisted in 1971, and disrupted shortly thereafter on SAF and President scholarships to Cambridge, returning to active service only in 1974.<br><br>Alternatively ask your uncles/family friends who served that time to send out the survey form to their fellow unit members.</div>
