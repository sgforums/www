            <div class='col-md body'>What is the rational behind this acquisition? Does Singapore have similar plans or do we already have them? We could have gotten the Isareli Popeye stand-off missile or used current UAVs with warheads.

            <div class='col-md body'>For us I think we shud get the THEL or the MTHEL laser system. A missle defence system like the patriot or the arrow system would be a huge waste of money ... 3 reasons.<br><br>1) because eventually someone will eventually find a way to counter measure against it, then we have to upgrade constantly. A laser system on other hand my understanding is it tracks the targets in trajectory and uses high tempreature from the beam to destroy it in flight. Laser Beams burns only electricity, missiles if missed the target is $$$ down the toilet.<br><br>2) A laser system deployed signals to our neighbours that we are peaceful and the system by itself is non-offensive and cannot be used offensively.<br><br>3) A laser system sends signal to "would-be" powers that we are not another regional competitor peddling for influence, we're just neutral.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Energy weapons would be near to the Holy Grail of ABM defences.For us to possess a THEL or a future wide-area HEL system, would really signal a paradigm shift in the capability of our forces and send a message to potential adversaries or troublemakers in the region.It's a whole new level of warfare as I see it, JSFs with planned solidstate lasers, MTHEL and THEL systems..Now that's a 4G army.USA could have it in 15-20 years...</div>

They face a constant security threat, many civilians lost their innocents lives and many more at risk evetyday... thay had been to a few wars.... thru that.... their Defence equipment manufacturer improve their hardware.....  it is by logic of basic survival.... like why spore is supposedly better in our region...? we are at higher risk of been engaged by our neighbours than our neighbours themselves... so we are forced by circumstances to invent and innovate, else aggressors might have their field day... why the diff between  ST and them....? ST's equipment had not really been combat  ( war ) tested...  They had... and combat experience is a good testbed for improvement...<br><br>nice try on the figures.... anyone can swipe it off web....<br>DIN your books,forums, internet tell you all these...???<br>Tell allow me to " GUIDE " you....<br><br>anyway this is not meant to inslut the Pre-enlistees....<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong></strong><blockquote><strong>Originally posted by SibeiSuayKia:<br>[b]you still haven't explain why ST engineering loses out in terms of innovation and creation of new weapons.<br><br></strong></blockquote>[/b]<br><br>Well, thought you would have the knowledge by now....<br>nvm.... well there are afew reasons...<br><br>1. Depends on who you compare ST with. In our region, ST did well, our neighbours are not so involved in R and D and manufacture their own defence equipment... they simply buy off the shelf and alter to suit their needs rather than tailor make... But if you are looking beyond this region... ST not quite on the world map yet,,, though they had sold some of their Defence Equipment to  foreign armies , but ST still got a long way to go..<br><br>2. If we have the political will, we can. ( think some of the high tech equipment that can track snipers, chemical trace and driverless assualt vehicle : better not to name them... if u do ur own research after this, no need to tell everyone here..!!!<br><br>3.They had been fighting for their survival for the past 4 , 5 decades... innovation is their means of tipping the balance to their favour... They have to harness on the technologicial and clever operational planning  to turn the situation to their favour. They need to fight daily , for their survival. they have skermish almost daily... the day they lose the advantage, will be the beginning of their nitemare.<br><br>4. They have assistance from Country " X ". we all know who. financial assistance even.<br><br>5. some of our locally developed defence equipment is almost similar to those of country " Y ".. those who seen... should know wat i'm talking abt...  the BX, UAV, ATTC, small arms, ...  similar to those in the mkt...<br><br>6. wat makes you so sure that our local ST equipment not up to standard...? what you dun know doesn't mean they dun exist... there is too much u dun know... which can't be posted here..... i had seen for my own eyes.... some things are mean the way they are.... SECRET..  let them remain that way and do not probe any further....<br><br>btw... pls stop asking stupid questions.. see for yourself during NS... and keep quiet abt wat you saw.... unless u wanna betray SPORE...</div>

UAV Modded F-22 Style Capabilities Fighter jet, which means<br>the fighter is auto pilotted and pre-programmed to blast enemy<br>area, that means if it's radar automatically detect enemy,<br>it will proceed to engage it , then go back to the previous flight path.<br><br>B. the F-22 style will also have space capabilities, the engine will also<br>be larger in order to provide enough thrust for it to reach space,<br>it will also have hydrogen tanks and ion engines to cruise to and fro in<br>space<br><br>2)  A. Our ship might be floating when that time comes , hovering over<br>the sea , and equipped with laser cannon (think command and conquer<br>ion cannon style) and they will be equipped with a newer type of<br>armour , think it should be like a force field type last time<br>i heard there was a article in which people could use the "force field<br>to block the HEAT rounds" , hope scientists will research more on it.<br><br>B.  Multi Guidance missile , that means the missile will not only track<br>using IR and Radar , it will also track using satellite and more<br>missile manoevurability and ability to cruise through space using<br>ion engines.<br>(ion engines are currently used by satellites to speed through space<br>and to reach satellites and they can go for long periods of time<br>ideal for us)<br><br>C.  Satellites which can fire nuclear missiles/lasers and incinerate cities<br>or act as a refueling station for our F-22 style space jet.<br><br>3) A.With Regards to Land , i think we could have Mech Warrior III<br>in which they can move faster, go through all terrains and utilize laser<br>and all the missile options available inside it , cannons++<br><br>B. Having mech warriors also give us advantage in which a normal tank<br>can't have, for example , a tank would have problems trying to barge inside a place with mines( we're completely ignoring the fact that the C-130<br>or Chinook might airlift the tank inside , in fact we could have rocket<br>propellants to thrust the mech warrior up behind it.<br><br>C. This will be RSAF's 15th Generation Army , whole new revolution..<br>And 1 more regarding multi missile warheads.. in fact we could have like<br>1 missile , once like 2km away from target could split into multiple  warheads and auto engage multiple targets..<br><br>D. A Fighter jet which can fire missile in all directions , that means<br>the firing bay or loading bay can fire from the back front up and down<br>a new style..for NASA Space Shuttle , on the space suit, they got<br>some sorta thrust vectoring in which the astronaut can move in all<br>directions, that means without turning the plane and facing 9Gs<br>we can automatically reverse the plane by firing the thrust forward.<br><br>That is my wish for SAF, 150 years from now =D , satellites will be our new<br>KC-135 ! Hurray!<br><br>SAF 1000 years from now.<br><br>This is my wish, for Singapore to survive , and not to decline , sensible political leaders around.<br><br>When that time come, Who knows? perhaps people would have discovered material that is about 100 times stronger then Uranium 235, perhaps less then 1 megaton needed to blow up 1 entire country the size of australia.<br><br>Or perhaps the World will have too many world wars..people have taken into underground due to winter..RSAF probably will stop flying. Then RSUF ,<br>Then we will have that kind of<br>driller which can fire drilling style of missiles perhaps we will war by  going thru the earth's core and fighting.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote>What is the rationale behind this acquisition?</blockquote>Not really a big deal. Australia is just trying to upgrading their air combat arsenal, with their ageing F-111 strike bombers are due to be phased out by 2010. The cruise missiles aren't going to be operational until between 2007 &amp; 2009, according to reports.<br><br>The whole thing's taken on a political tone due to historical mistrust &amp; topical fears: Indonesian invasion of East Timor, Bali bombing, war on terror, Australian's allied role vs. North Korea, el al.<br><br>I read that there's also this past regional spat over the F-111's when Australia 1st bought them in the '60s, as a nuclear deterrent-cum-threat against Indonesia during the Confrontation era. Then they ordered 15 more such aircrafts in the early '90s, without initially informing Indonesia &amp; causing a rift then. At least for this time around, they're said to be willing to brief their neighbors on the new plans ~shrugs~</div>
