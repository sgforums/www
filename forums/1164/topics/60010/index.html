            <div class='col-md body'>Don't know why one would bother, really.  It's just the same old bunch of blowhards who got their noses out of joint over the fact that we didn't accept the gospel according to Mao.

            <div class='col-md body'>Bro NathanG5! Have you already post the topic in that board asking them why. I search i was not able to find your topic. Did you post or not?<br><br>Well it seem that only a few of them hate Singapore to the core. Some of them think that Singapore should be part of China. A lot of them don't view Singapore as a multi racial country but as a <strong>Chinese</strong> country.<br><br>Brother NathanG5! I will be waiting for you to post the topic in that board.</div>
