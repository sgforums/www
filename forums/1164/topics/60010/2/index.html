Just becos' they were a great civilization once, these pathetic bunch feel the world owes it to them to look up to them as a world power. It's not good when a country is ruled by someone with eaten up with personal grudges - just look north. However, it's even scarier when a sizable chunk of a nuclear-powered nation has chips on their shoulders</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Much can be debated around here in peacetime, however, if you are one of the 6000 troops stationed there and you want to trust the invading  PLA force to be kindly to you ppl, forget it. The lower -level commanders are not Bejing politicians, they just do whatever is neccesary to acheive their bjectives. Will you stand there and trust them to accept your surrender or will you fight back in self-defence? Personally, i will do the latter.</div>

And because it is a war the PLA might fire the first shot. In that scenario Singaporean soldiers might have to defend themself. But PLA is so big and powerful.

            <div class='col-md body'>guys...... the 6000 figure is the max that we sent over.... usually peaked during july to september..... because of summer in taiwan...... i do not believe we have 6000 people there all year round..... these 6000 will include people from sispec/ocs, NS units...... given that the barrack has limited bunk space....i don't think it is possible....<br><br>there are some chinese which are used to their own propoganda......... some of them talk through their backside... so i do not really want to bother with it..... most chinese i know are rationale people..... only people which are immatured, uncultured, and low educational level and incapable of thinking far will shoot their mouth off,,,,,,  so i don't think we should even bother dignifying these comments with a remark.....<br><br>another observation..... some chinese think that china has arrived........the recent economic boom seems to have reinforce this view.... but nobody told them that the bubble will burst...... from the economic intel collected, there seems to have a property boom (or bubble) in major cities.... occupancy rate does not seems to go up with this boom..... further more, income level is also not growing proportionally with this boom..... legal system is primitive and inefficient....... it is a time bomb..... and all that glitters is not gold...... China will have to reform..... how..... either the govt take some immediate but painfully action in truely reforming the legal system, improve regulation and what nots or reform through a financial crisis.....<br><br>one friend of my from shanghai commented that the price of a starbucks coffee is even more expensive than that in new york..... but the income level of ordinary shanghainese is not even on par with that of an ordinary new yorker......it seems that greed is the word of the day.<br><br>so by 2025.... i will not be surprise if the bubble burst....... until<br>then, they can remain confident and arrogant.......after that....china will need the world as in the 80s.........</div>

Just writing what i think.</div></blockquote>Simple actually.......The US,Japan,Europe and ASEAN can actually do alot.The reason why is because China is not some 3rd world country.China ships in 70% of it's OIL usage.Europe,Japan and USA controls most of the Super tankers in the world.While Singapore and USA controls the 2 fastest way frm the Mid-East to China.Especially seeing as to how the Russian pipeline will most probably end up in Japan instead of China and Japan.Talks on that are still ongoing.Currently China has enough oil reserves for something like 2 weeks or less.If the world does that China might have 3 responses.Invade Russia and end up having to fight Russia,Europe and the US due to political stuff and alliences,besides Russia is not a push over she is still great.Stop the invasion retreat and get a peace treaty which is very humiliating and seeing as to how the Chinese have such big egos that might not happen.The final way is to Nuke the world but that's a MAD situation and they know it too.So there you have it.....How the Chinese though powerful and people may tremble at her power she is still subjected to the rules of economies and relies heavily on the world for her needs even if the Chinese hard heads do not think so.</div>
