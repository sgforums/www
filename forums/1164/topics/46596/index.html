Ramly said the radar system was unable to complement its weapons system.<br><br>"However, with the new helicopters, we will be able to use their radar system to optimise the use of our weapons system." Ramly was speaking to reporters after handing the last of the six WASP HAS Mk 1 helicopters to Abu Bakar Museum here this morning.<br><br>Also present were chairman of the museum's board of directors Datuk Kurnia Makram Datuk Abdullah Md Drus, museum director Ahmad Farid Abdul Jalal and Tanjung Gelang RMN chief Laksamana Pertama Mohd Amdan Kurish.<br><br>The other five WASPs are being displayed at the Maritime Museum in Malacca; Royal Malaysian Air Force Museum in Sungai Besi, Kuala Lumpur; Universiti Sains Malaysia campus in Tronoh, Perak; and Universiti Teknologi Malaysia campus in Skudai, Johor.<br><br>In serving the RMN, the WASP helicopters have flown more than 10,000 hours with over 5,000 day and night landings aboard naval vessels.<br><br>In the 13 years of service, the WASPs have recorded zero accidents.<br><br>It is learnt that the Fennec helicopter, which is capable of carrying four people, will be used for training purposes while the Super Lynx multi-role helicopter will have anti-ship weapons capabilities and able to ferry six personnel for maritime operations.<br><br>"The Fennec also has added advantages as it has twin engines and other special capabilities for sea operations," said Ramly.<br><br>"We will be displaying one of the Super Lynx helicopters at the Langkawi International Aerospace and Maritime Exhibition to be held from Sept 31 to Oct 4."</div>

We plan to develop our Malaysian maintenance depot into a regional base,Â” he said.<br><br>Eurocopter has started building a new hangar for helicopters and rotary wing aircraft in Subang, while its administrative office is based in Kelana Jaya.<br><br>Â“Eurocopter is also working with several companies, such as Sapura Technology, Zetro Aerospace, SME Aerospace and Ikramatic System to further developing our industrial co-operation,Â” Ducrot said.<br><br>Â“In the future, we are exploring the possibility of conducting customisation work on some of our helicopters in Malaysia,Â” he pointed out.<br><br>Eurocopter is currently bidding to sell its EC-635 helicopters to the Malaysian army.<br><br>Ducrot described the Tiger and NH90 helicopters as two of the most exciting new products of Eurocopter.<br><br>Â“The Tiger uses stealth technology and is the modern-day attack helicopter. The French and German armed forces will be the first to have the Tiger range with 80 each, while Australia has ordered 22 units.<br><br>Â“As for the NH90, it is a state-of-the-art transport helicopter and we have received over 250 orders for it.<br><br>Â“We are competing (for tenders) in several countries in Asia and we would like to promote both these aircraft to Malaysia as well,Â” he added.<br><br>He revealed that Eurocopter already had a total of 60 orders for the NH90 from Finland, Norway and Sweden.<br><br>Â“Our targets are to build up the production of the Tiger and NH90 helicopters and develop them into benchmark products.<br><br>Â“We also want to make our customer support more effective through a new structural approach and a denser network of 'on-the-spot' services,Â” he added.<br><br>To a question, Ducrot said it had cost 2bil euros (RM8bil) for research and development on the Tiger helicopter, which was said to have a price tag of 20mil Euros (RM80mil) each. On EurocopterÂ’s order books, he said it had received orders worth a total of US$9bil, adding that this would keep the company busy over the next four to five years.</div>

We also have no plans of discarding the Exocet MM38 missiles which have been used since the 70's</strong>," he said.<br><br><strong>All the old variations would be used until stocks had run out</strong>, he said.<br><br>The RMN first used the missiles with the acquisition of the <strong>Sea Cats </strong>for the frigates <strong>KD Rahmat</strong> and <strong>KD Hang Tuah</strong> which were bought in 1966 while the <strong>Exocet MM38s</strong> were first used by the fast assault craft <strong>Spica M</strong> purchased from Sweden in 1979.</div>

Foss said that Malaysia's recent arms procurement had definitely improved the firepower of the its armed forces.<br><br>The army in particular, he said, had been trying in recent years to upgrade its capabilites and the purchases during the just-ended Defence Services Asia '02 as well as before the exhibition were certainly "a shot in the arm".<br><br>"(As a result of the new purchases), your armed forces are going to have an improved capability than 10 years ago," Foss said when met recently.<br><br>"That (procurement of G5 and MLRS-system) has considerably increased the range and firepower of your (Malaysian armed forces') artillery," said Foss, adding that Malaysia had also placed orders for an additional six G5 howitzers.<br><br><strong>The G5 howitzer has a range of 40km using standard ammunition but can reach 50km using the rocket-assisted projectile while the Brazilian-MLRS has a maximum range of 90km.<br><br>The MLRS can also launch longer-range tactical surface-to-surface missiles. </strong><br><br>Foss said that Malaysia's air defence capability had also received a boost with an <strong>agreement to acquire an undisclosed number of Jernas low-altitude anti-aircraft missiles from the European defence consortium, MBDA</strong>.<br><br>The 220 million pound-sterling deal which was inked during DSA '02, said Foss, was a significant step to Malaysia's air defence system as it gave them "a whole new capability they never had before."<br><br>The regiment-strong <strong>Jernas</strong> will be delivered to the Malaysian armed forces in three years.<br><br>The modern <strong>Jernas</strong> short-range air defence system (Shorads) and <strong>Igla V</strong>-Shorads will complement earlier armed forces' purchases of Pakistani-made <strong>Anza Mk-11</strong> and Thales' <strong>Starburst</strong> shoulder-launch surface-to-air missiles.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>The rag up north has reached a point where it has set new standards and hallmarks for imaginative and fictional reporting in mainstream media. While recent US journalists have come to light in scandals for false reporting, the ones up north don't even have to use any muscles (much less the one that matters) to exceed the misdeeds of their US counterparts.<br><br>Anyway, their articles are so incredibly stupid and ammo-scounging that it's amazing anybody still listens to them. I make it a point to ignore them out of hand the moment they present some "article" to "challange" us.</div>
