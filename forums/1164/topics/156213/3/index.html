            <div class='col-md body'><strong>Super Skyhawks pique students' interest in careers with RSAF</strong><br><br>The ageing Republic of Singapore Air Force's (RSAF) A4-SU Super Skyhawk fighter aircraft have found new homes in local tertiary institutions.<br><br>Retired in March this year, these aircraft are on loan to Ngee Ann Polytechnic (NP), Temasek Polytechnic (TP), Singapore Polytechnic (SP) and the Nanyang Technological University (NTU).<br><br>Since their relocation to the institutions in October, the aircraft have received much praise from lecturers and students, who are grateful to the RSAF for this unique learning opportunity.<br><br>Professor Shaker Meguid, head of the new aerospace engineering programme at NTU, said that it was necessary for students to have relevant and realistic training before they join the aviation industry in Singapore.<br><br>For NTU, the loan of the Super Skyhawk came at a perfect time, as its aerospace degree programme was launched in July.<br><br>While the three polytechnics have a longer track record in aviation studies, the Super Skyhawks have helped to improve their curriculum. Previously, the polytechnics relied solely on books, pictures and multimedia materials to teach aviation.<br><br>This was something Mr Cheah Swee Hock, course manager for the Mechatronics diploma course at TP, felt needed improvement.<br><br>"With the aircraft, we can see all the structures Â– piping, engines," he said. "So now, they can actually see it, touch it and that can have a very strong impact on their learning."<br><br>Mr James Leung, deputy director of NP's Mechanical Engineering division agreed. In aerospace programmes, subjects like airframes, systems and engines have to be covered and there is no better way to teach these subjects than through direct access to actual aircraft like the A4-SUs.<br><br>Luckily for these institutions, the RSAF felt the same way too. When the polytechnics wrote in to request the retired aircraft, the RSAF was aware that a loan of the aircraft would aid in the training of students.<br><br>Besides, if these institutions churned out better-skilled workers, as an employer the RSAF would benefit too.<br><br>The passion of these polytechnic students was evident as they stayed back in school late at night to await the arrival of the aircraft. At NP, more than 50 students stayed back just to witness the significant moment.<br><br>Â“This is not something you see every day,Â” said Gerard Wong, a final-year Mechatronics student from TP. Â“It was breathtaking to see how they moved the aircraft in.Â”<br><br>Gerard, like many other students from the polytechnics studying Aerospace Engineering and Mechatronics Engineering, plans to embark on a career with the RSAF.<br><br>The Super Skyhawk at his polytechnic is spurring him on to chase that dream.<br><br><a href="http://www.mindef.gov.sg/imindef/publications/cyberpioneer/news/2005/October/26oct05_news.html&lt;br%20/&gt;" rel="nofollow">http://www.mindef.gov.sg/imindef/publications/cyberpioneer/news/2005/October/26oct05_news.html<br></a></div>
