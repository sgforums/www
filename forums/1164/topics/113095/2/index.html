            <div class='col-md body'>Okay, so I'm picky about aesthetics! <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz"><br><br>Thanks - I'm sure we'll have a blast.  Yeah, our guys are pretty tight.  We had our first gathering in December (this coming one's a short follow-up to bring in the guys we missed the first time), and Ng Heng Chew, our OC, was pretty chuffed that we managed to get so many guys together.  Then again, he built the company, and that's a guy I would attach the "legend" title to.<br><br>Anyway, these reunions are going to be an annual affair.  I heard from the OC of 2 Coy of 1977 that they just had their reunion a couple of weeks ago.</div>
