Unfortunately, he went to ground after the story broke, and I haven't been able to contact him and get his side of the story.<br><br>Anyway, I knew him when he was a platoon sargeant in another company because we had mutual friends in the battalion.  While I personally knew him to be a top bloke, he did have a reputation in the battalion as the wild sort.  You account matches what I'd heard about him while I was overseas, namely that he'd mellowed out a lot.  Unfortunately, with his past, he didn't stand much of a chance in this witch hunt.</div>
