            <div class='col-md body'>Well after reading the posting in this threads, some with gd points and some with bad points, i read the New Paper Report abt the Cpt.<br><br>Like some you guys said, thats how SAF works, its more like thats how life works really.<br><br>He happened to to be Supervising Officer in paper( hope i am right here), and the Admin Instructions itself is a legal document, i remember my S3 drilling us day in day out last time on the importance of the document of how it can either save ones ass or frys ones ass.<br><br>Its a sad event for Cpt Pandi, the actions untaken by his fellow CDO proves that only a gd leader, one that many respect will allow such actions of writing letters to ministers etc. Its really sad that the world operates this way. Remember the monumenets on the top of the Supreme Court, where one of the figures holding the scales of Justices was blindfolded, in the eyes of the law, whoever has done wrong in what way has to be punished.<br><br>I just hope Cpt Pandi is able to resume his life if not his carrer. For i always belive in the Ranger's Creed, "Never shall I fail my comrades" and he will pick himself up again.<br><br>regards<br></div>

Man, I don't know what you're smoking, but for your sake I hope nobody in law enforcement gets a whiff of it.

Pay scales are, of course, according to the roles and breadth of responsibility.  That's got jack squat to do with what's being discussed here, so keep that nonsense to yourself.  You sound like you've either got a severe cognitive distortion, or you simply want to spew irrelevant crap to make yourself sound clever - that cockamamie plan obviously hasn't worked.</div>

Are you a general? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br>Here we have a minister and former member of general staff, and he's running for cover and throwing a captain to the public as a decoy.  I think that says it all about your little "generals are so great" theory.  As such, you can stick your brainwave where the sun don't shine.<br><br>Listen, boy, when you try to yammer and stammer on about roles in society and education, maybe you'd better check around and see who you're talking to.  If you're average Joe, you're going to make a damned fool of yourself talking to much bigger people about being a "real man".<br><br>Sure, the crowd sits at the bar and complains.
