It's<br>not just an F-5, it's a whole new plane."<br></strong> Well, sort of. Acquired by the air force in 1979, the F-5Es as they were<br>known then, were Singapore's first supersonic fighters.<br>.........................................<br>Now, the upgrading of the RSAF's entire Tiger fleet of about 40 planes has<br>been completed, at about $6 million a plane. This is a bargain considering<br>that a brand new F-16 costs about US$25 (S$43) million.<br>The upgrading has given the F-5S an additional lifespan of 10 to 15 years<br>each.<br>As for sceptics who think that the upgrade results in only superficial<br>changes, Mr Lim Tau Fuie, vice-president of avionics in STA, had this to say:<br>"It's now a much more effective plane than what it used to be.<br>"If there were no benefits, then other air forces like the <strong>Turkish Air Force<br>wouldn't have gone for it."<br></strong> BOMBS AWAY 'There's no need to see the target.

Use the softest to counter the hardest.We dared to do others not keen to do.<br><br>29/06/2005    STimes              Page: H2<br>Headline: It's true, water can absorb power of big blast<br>By: David Boey<br><br><blockquote>DEFENCE engineers here made an explosive breakthrough recently that could radically change the design of military bunkers and civilian bomb shelters.<br>After experiments showed that water-filled containers could help absorb the<br>destructive power of a bomb blast, engineers from the Defence Science and<br>Technology Agency (DSTA) held a full-scale trial with their counterparts in<br>Sweden,<strong> blowing up 10 tonnes of explosives.  </strong><br><br>Packed around the 10 one-tonne lots of explosives - each capable of punching a 3m-wide crater in the ground - were containers filled with two tonnes of water each.<br>On detonation, the containers were wrecked. But the energy from the<br>explosion vapourised the water,<strong> reducing the effect of the blast by 60 per<br>cent.<br></strong>Hailing the results as a major breakthrough, DSTA chief executive Richard<br>Lim said yesterday that defence engineers worldwide had considered using water barriers to reduce the effect of an explosion.<br>But none had tested the idea on the scale of the experiment conducted in<br>Sweden last month. He added that the experiments are important as water<br>barriers can potentially reduce the amount of land needed as a safety buffer<br>around ammunition bunkers.<br>Mr Lim updated the media on research developments at DSTA when he unveiled a 60-page book to mark five years of DSTA's achievements.<br>The book will be distributed to organisations such as government bodies,<br>tertiary institutions and public libraries.<br>DSTA was formed five years ago from several Ministry of Defence departments to serve as the national authority on weapons procurements and military technology.<br>Mr Lim added that another area his engineers are working on is to help<br>national security planners assess the impact of a bomb blast, similar to the<br>car bomb detonated outside the JW Marriott Hotel in Jakarta. The August 2003<br>terror attack killed 12 people.<br>'One of the scenarios that we are looking into is the extent of building<br>damage and casualties in the event of a car bomb exploding near or at the<br>entrance of a hotel, similar to the attack at the Marriott,' he said.<br>From its analysis, using computer modelling and other tools, DSTA will<br>recommend measures<strong> to minimise casualties and damages, if not prevent an attack.<br></strong></blockquote>2. <strong>More than 6 years of effort to confirm water as buffer   </strong><br><blockquote>In undertaking this project, MINDEF achieved a number of ground-breaking results in R&amp;D. Significant achievements have been made in <strong>water mitigation </strong>and ground shock studies. Water mitigation makes use of water to absorb the energy of an accidental explosion. This greatly reduces the safety buffer zone, freeing up land for productive use. Ground shock studies enables our engineers to formulate structural engineering codes for the safe construction of buildings in areas affected by ground shock effects. This also reduces land wastage.</blockquote>fr Speech by Mr David Lim, Minister of State for Defence and Information &amp; the Arts, at the Ground-Breaking Ceremony for the Underground Ammunition Facilty   Email Article    Dd: 12 Aug 1999,<br>fr <a href="http://www.mindef.gov.sg/imindef/news_and_events/nr/1999/aug/12aug99_nr.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.mindef.gov.sg/imindef/news_and_events/nr/1999/aug/12aug99_nr.html</a><br><br>Pl note Sg rewrite ammo storage code for NATO.</div>
