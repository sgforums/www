Ship<br>MIAMI Â— The crew of a luxury cruise ship used a sonic weapon that blasts earsplitting noise in a directed beam while being attacked by a gang of pirates off Africa this weekend, the cruise line said Monday.<br><br>The Seabourn Spirit had a Long Range Acoustic Device, or LRAD, installed as a part of its defense systems, said Bruce Good, a spokesman for Miami-based Seabourn Cruise Line. The Spirit was about 100 miles off Somalia when pirates fired rocket-propelled grenades and machine guns as they tried to get onboard.<br><br>The subsidiary of Carnival Corp. was investigating whether the weapon was successful in warding off the pirates, he said. The ship's captain also changed its course, shifted into high speed and headed out into the open sea to elude the pirates, who were in two small boats, he said. He had no further details.<br><br>Device maker American Technology Corp. said earsplitting "bangs" were directed by trained security personnel toward the pirates. That, combined with ship maneuvers, caused the attackers to leave the area, the company said.<br><br>The LRAD is a so-called "non-lethal weapon" developed for the U.S. military after the 2000 attack on the USS Cole off Yemen as a way to keep operators of small boats from approaching U.S. warships.<br><br>The military version is a 45-pound, dish-shaped device that can direct a high-pitched, piercing tone with a tight beam. Neither the LRAD's operators or others in the immediate area are affected.<br><br>American Technology, based in San Diego, compares its shrill tone to that of smoke detectors, only much louder. It can be as loud as about 150 decibels, while smoke alarms are about 80 to 90 decibels.<br><br>The devices have been deployed on commercial and naval vessels worldwide since summer 2003, the company said.</blockquote></div>

The contract, worth US$38m (approximately S$65m), involves a cargo conversion and avionics upgrade programme for two of the Royal New Zealand Air Force's (RNZAF) Boeing 757-200 aircraft.<br><br>Targeting to induct the first aircraft in October 2006, MAE will convert the aircraft from an all passenger arrangement to a multi-role configuration that allows the carriage of passenger, freight, mixed passenger-freight, Very-Important-Persons (VIPs) and Aero-Medical Evacuation. Completion of the programme is expected to take about two years.<br><br>In 2004, ST Aerospace and Israel Aircraft Industries (IAI) signed a licensing agreement with Boeing for the licence of data for the B757-200 Special Freighter Supplemental Type Certificate (STC).  The 757-200 STC was originally developed for a DHL conversion programme by Boeing with ST Aerospace and IAI as risk sharing partners, who shared the engineering services and performed the conversion work on the DHL contract.  Approximately 250 B757-200 aircraft is expected to be converted in the next 20 years, while more than 900 Boeing 757-200s have been delivered to 52 airlines since the aircraft first flew in 1982.<br></blockquote></div>

Dr Yap, 41, is head of the<br>population genetics laboratory at the Defence Medical and Environmental<br>Research Institute, a facility that comes under DSO National Laboratories,<br>Singapore's biggest defence research and development lab.<br>Tests on the device are continuing in the lab, located next to the National<br>University Hospital, to broaden the computer database to include information on as many types of viruses as possible.<br>'We can detect what we know, but how do you detect what you don't know, like new viruses or bacteria,' said Dr Yap. 'We don't have samples of everything from everywhere.'<br>At yesterday's award ceremony, Defence Minister Teo Chee Hean also gave out four team awards to projects advancing the performance of air defence radars and technology that helps SAF commanders lead and control their units during operations.<br>Mr Teo added that apart from home-grown innovations, Singapore has also been able to leverage on international technology partners to 'multiply what we can do on our own'.<br><br><strong>For instance, a 275g air surveillance vehicle called the Wasp<br>was tested here two weeks ago by the Defence Technology<br>and Research Agency(POster note:I think it should be DSTA) with the United States<span style="font-style: italic;"><a href="http://www.darpa.mil" rel="nofollow"> The Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) </a></span></strong><br>The Wasp, which carries two cameras, is one of 19 projects<br>that the US agency is working on with scientists here.<br>dboey@sph.com.sg<br><br></div>

After completing his diploma, he helped in churches and orphanages in<br>India but soon returned to Singapore.<br>'We can't function without money. We have to make some money too,' he said.<br>He returned to work on composite materials, but graduated from model<br>vehicles to the real thing, making car body kits for rally cars and racing<br>bikes.<br>'I have a friend who used to work for Lotus, the race car company, and he<br>taught me a lot about composite technology,' he added.<br>By working on hi-fi speakers using kevlar, he also began to appreciate the<br>qualities of this tough yet supple material.<br>He then decided to combine his childhood interest in military equipment and<br>his knowledge of composite materials.<br>In November last year, he gave up his $10,000-a-month job and roped in his<br>old neighbour Richard, whom he has known since they were five.<br>Did he ever imagine he would end up in the defence industry when he was<br>studying theology in Oklahoma in 1991?<br>It's not all that different, he said. 'My work is all about saving lives.'<br><br>dboey@sph.com.sg<br><br>The Lims with their inventions<br><br>THE black panel held by Mr Norman Lim is the soft ceramic armour. It is about<br>16mm thick.<br>The Lims fired five 5.56mm rounds at it using an M-16 assault rifle with<br>zero penetration.<br>Normal ceramic armour needed to resist these hits would be about 10mm thick.<br>However, it is much harder to wear as it is inflexible, especially when the<br>wearer has it on his chest and back, and tries to bend over. The Lims' armour<br>can also resist multiple hits. The tile held by Mr Richard Lim has been made<br>bullet- proof with a resin and fibre coating.<br>END of news<br><br></div>

Without munitions our systems have no purpose,Â” said Metal Storm Chief Executive Officer (CEO), David Smith.<br><br>Â“It means we have an arrangement to convert US Army inventory rounds in the United States and in all other markets we propose to have munitions available through ST Kinetics.Â”<br><br>ST Kinetics is one of the worldÂ’s leading 40mm munitions designers and manufacturers with a range that includes unique capabilities for Metal Storm weapon systems.<br><br>The agreement provides opportunities for the rapid development, testing and eventual certification of a range of 40mm munitions for use with Metal StormÂ’s weapon systems.</blockquote></div>

These vessels will allow the Arab Republic of Egypt to maintain the security of its coastal regions as well as those of friendly countries.  The vessels will be approximately 62m in length and will incorporate ship signature control technology.  High speed and manoeuvrability are two of their primary assets to fulfill these roles.  The vessels will also incorporate numerous combat system assets and electronic sensors that give them capabilities in anti-aircraft, anti-surface and electronic warfare.</blockquote><strong><a href="http://www.stengg.com/CoyCapPro/listing.aspx?pdtypeid=1" rel="nofollow">Products of ST here </a></strong>----whole range of SAF's  needs.<br><br><img src="http://www.stengg.com/upload/523AkP8XaDmanlDJEYg.jpg"><br><br>57m Stealth Patrol Vessel by ST Marine</div>

Everybody is afraid of drying, investing in health science and bioengineering to improve our own quality of life will be the future consumer trend.<br><br>In order to Sg to leadfrog the cheap Chinese competitors, we have to go into bioscience in full force. Not only to make medical drugs and do DNA research... we must not forget to incorporate the unique advantage of singapore - semicon wafer fab...<br><br>On the first look, bioengineering and wafer technology does not seems to mixed. But if you do some net research, many US firms and tech start-up are getting already to ramp up their biochip or bio-implants that is made by semicon wafer fabs.<br><br>If we hedge the ride with the correct timing, our Sg economy will surely benefits.
