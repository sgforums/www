We were also facing an extremely likely threat of annexation by our immediate neighbours, especially Malaysia. Our nations defence consist of no more than 2 infantry battallions and a few boats.

That doesn't make much sense for us, does it?

This policy began in 1969 when some of the more radical senior UMNO officials (led by Razak) began to call for the return of Singapore. Of course, UMNO can never admit to the fact that they were the ones who ejected SG from the Federation, so naturally they sweep it under the carpet with the pretense that Singapore left on its own will...<br><br>PAI SEH AH <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_redface.gif" alt="Embarassed" title="Embarassed"> Looks like you are another magnificent success at your country's brain washing programme, only I doubt that you had a brain in thebeginning for them to wash!<img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"></div>

As you know, we Singaporeans are famous for being very kiasu and stingy, so we sold either sold the Malaysia passports to the garang guni man or used the pages for toilet paper.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"></div>
