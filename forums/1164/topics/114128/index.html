It sounds like very little now but that's because of inflation. 2.9 million in the 1950s would be equivalent to more than several billion today. You don't use that much money to pay for a few years of admin for a mining island.<br><br>Besides that, the word used is "acquire" meaning "buy". In addition, since we were under the British as at 1958, if the islands weren't our property then why were we, a crown colony, being paid when the money should have gone to the Colonial Office in London?<br><br>The islands were ours in everything except documentation. A year later, Singapore became self governing and our territory was marked out.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I think the possibility is very low. Firstly why would the Australian government sell part of their country to another country? This will effect their national pride as this may be seen that they are unable to defend their own territory.They are not cash-strapped or anything. Furthermore they have a mining industry there(not sure if its still operational). Thirdly we will then have islands closer to the Indonesia island of Java where all there industries, population and not to mention the capital(Jarkarta). If we used these islands for LF,the Indonesian government will be very worried and maybe even protest. Imagine that we already have the NGF at that time, they will view us as a  'bad neighbour' <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"></div>
