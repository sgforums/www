            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by chino65:</div><div class="quote_body">What I like about this vehicle is that it took the SPG book and threw it out the window.<br><br>This German vehicle is a step away from the traditional tank configuration which seems to give more space for crew and ammo while still offering armour protection.<br><br>A few other countries have also abandoned the traditional SPG "tank" configuration by already mounting 155 guns on truck chassis.</div></blockquote>I think the demise of the "traditional" tracked SPA is vastly exaggerated.<br><br>Tracked SPGs are to provide arty support for Mechanised formations.  Wheeled Arty or Towed Arty are for motorised or legs infantry.  Still hasn't changed.<br><br>The recent spurt in R&amp;D on light weight wheeled SPA has more to do with the changed threat matrix of the major armies than on them abandoning tracked turreted SPA for truck mounted guns.<br><br>With the demise of the Warsaw Pact, there is no longer a pressing need for large numbers of MBTs and their attendent tracked SPA.  Instead, these countries now find their focus is on international peace keeping duties with an emphasis on light, rapidly deployable forces.  Hence the sudden surge in interest in wheeled SPA (G6, Caeser) and lightweight tracked SPA (eg. Soltam Rascal, KMW AGM).<br><br>The only innovation I see is in the marrage of the towed Artillery with the truck platform that used to tow it.  This allows for higher carraige speed both on and off-road as well as faster deployment times.  At the end of the day, it still remains an Artillery platform for motorised or legs formation.  Artillery support for a mechanised formation will still require a tracked SPA platform.  The spate of new lightweight tracked SPA is more due to the need for a platform to accompany the RDFs (which seem to be flavour of the month for every army).<br><br>That doesn't mean that Heavy tracked SPAs are no longer required.  While the matrix for the old Warsaw/NATO threat axis has changed, there are still plenty of potential "hotspots" worldwide where large scale conventional warfare is still a possibility.  In such "hotspots", the respective armed forces are actively acquiring/developing modern MBTs and tracked SPAs.<br><br>Examples of such hotspots include Greece/Turkey (the med equivalent of Singapore/Malaysia).  There is also the staple North/South Korea "truce" as well as the India/Pakistan saber rattling.<br><br>Take for example India ... While India currently lacks a modern tracked SPG, it is not for the lack of trying.  The recently aborted Bhim T-6 SPG was their attempt to indigenously develop a tracked SPG.  Instead, the Indian Defence Ministry has recently (May 07) issued a RFP for approx. 100 tracked SPG platforms with likely options for more to be produced locally with some form of tech transfer.  Other countries on the list of recent purchasers of modern SPGs include Greece who have opted for the Pzh2000 along with their Leo 2A6HEL.  South Korea has the K-9 whilst Turkey has the Firtina deriviative.  Singapore of course has the SSPH.<br><br>So in conclusion, heavy tracked SPA in the classical mould have not been dethroned by the upstart truck/gun hybrids.  They both fulfill different roles and it's just a matter of the local political climate as to which will play the larger role.</div>

I'm referring to the ones by Denel which can give a 52 cal gun a range of up to 70 km and above.</div>

However, I was referring more to your supposition of relying on our "conventional" guns for long range fire which I regard untenable. Naturally, the Primus has to resort to shoot and scoot tactics as per the commands issued to the Artillery firing unit.<br><br>As for a 52 cal version, they will have to do some serious tweaking to the chassis. As it stands, 52 cal is a much longer gun compared to 39 cal.</div>
