The Chinese government in the early days happily sent their officials to SG to learn about what makes our little island tick. They continue to view us as a China-friendly nation.<br><br>Secondly, it is also forgetting that SG govt has shrewdly cultivated realtionship with the Chinese govt for DECADES. We were there to help them modernise their economy long before anyone else. Though in the end we lost a lot of money but this money has bought us very good favour in the eyes of Chinese government.<br><br>For all the perceived ideological difference, the fact that we are all Chinese was not lost to the PAP and they played this card well. So relax, China does not view us as an enemy despite us appearing so western-oriented.<br><br>The recent admonishing of PM BG Lee HL was because the Chinese government has yet to acknowledge LHL as a senior leader worhty of respect - unlike his old man LKY which Chinese government holds in very high regard.</div>

That's why you see my last post was simply "sorry".<br><br>Yeah, that's exactly how I feel about the situation between China and Taiwan. Taiwan has always been a part of China. If let's say in 1965 the Workers Party decides to set up an independent People's Republic of Singapore on Pulau Ubin, should we just accept it?<br><br>What if it starts trading and by 2005 is a very strong economy? And Ubin has aligned itself with Malaysia and receives arms and training from the Malaysians.<br><br>Then Ubin decides to officially declare its independence. With official independence it means they can invite the Malaysians to build airbase and station troops on Ubin to deter an attack from Mainland Singapore.<br><br>What is the mainland supposed to do? If we attack, Malaysia vows to join in. If we don't the separatists on Sentosa whom are aligned with the Indonesians will be encouraged to step up their campaign for independence.<br><br>This is exactly the situation China is trapped in. Attack, sure die. Don't attack, also problem cos all the other places like Xinjiang and Tibet will take this as a sign of weakness and step up their revolt for independence.<br><br>And China will fall apart like the USSR.</div>

As for US, let's look at Gen Zhu's comments again:<br><br><strong>"If the Americans draw their missiles and position-guided ammunition on to the target zone on China's territory, I think we will have to respond with nuclear weapons," the official, Maj. Gen. Zhu Chenghu, said at an official briefing.<br><br>"War logic" dictates that a weaker power needs to use maximum efforts to defeat a stronger rival, he said, speaking in fluent English. "We have no capability to fight a conventional war against the United States," General Zhu said. "We can't win this kind of war." </strong><br><br>He is admitting China's military weakness as compared to US. They simply cannot win a conventional war against US and that's why he thinks China will use their nuke. What would you do if you're the president of China? what choices do you think China have?<br><br>Next on Taiwan, China leaders belong to the generation who lived through the humiliation of foreign invasions esp. Jap occupation. Defending their land or sovereignty is always the no 1 priority(Isn't that our priority as well?). It was reported that Deng Xiao Ping refused to visit HK until HK is handover to China by the British. He did not live long enough to see it. That is their mentality.<br><br>How can we say that it's selfish possession when Taiwan was part of China before the civil war? In any case, China never say they must re-unite by force. they only said Taiwan must not be independent. They are happy with the status-quo.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>China will be the first one to admit it is now at least 20 times weaker than US militarily.<br><br>But China will also be the first to remind you that when it fought the US in Korea during the 1950's the PLA must've been 200 times weaker than the US Army. The US was the mighty victor of WW2 whereas China was the sad loser that suffered grieviously during the war only to be further weakened by the civil war between the Chicom and KMT.<br><br>Still, China fought the Americans to a standstill. You can cite high casualty figures for PLA but this has never been a great problem for PLA.<br><br>So today, if US sends a task force sailing in to fight China on Taiwan's side, victory is not guaranteed. In fact, the US might again suffer serious damage to its ego. China isn't Iraq or Afghanistan.<br><br>And you cannot automatically count on South Korea and Japan to happily jump into the fray. S. Korea and Japan have so far never been threatened by China and are doing massive trading with China. In fact, both countries would rather wished the cockroach Chen Sui Bian disappear so they can all get on with their lives.</div>
