            <div class='col-md body'>Flame me if you want,flood my mailbox with hate mail if you want.But get this straight...we do not follow our old colonial masters.What we follow is the way the world is headed,a social norm.A culture thing which you cannot accept due to your ego...Hell,I'm Chinese.But unlike others,I'm proud to be a Singaporean chinese.Look at the amount of young mainland chinese youths trying to follow the westerns and you will realise that the problem does not lie with the world.Its with individual perception.The whiteman used to be strong..but I dare say,if they are wrong I will tell them straight.This ain't the days when the whiteman is always right,while others are wrong.<br><br>The only thing not discriminating or what...but frankly.Mainland Chinese have many things to learn instead of thinking that they are so high and mighty despite their booming economy,many of you are ingrateful of the sponsorships/scholarships which our government has so willingly offered to China students that you even insult the Republic of Singapore's government as stupid!How far can you go?Besides...being a student...I have seen a handful of Chinese from China who have adopted to the living and culture here.Unlike the majority who bitch about the living and education here.Think about it...I really respect the rare minority who have adapted and accepted the way of our life.So what if your country has the most number of people?You should adapt to the changes around you...not let the changes adapt to you!</div>

The Chinese race is like sand, tons of them around but never able to stand up to a rock.......,.... because we are never united.<br><br>Being Singaporean, it also upsets me to see so many scholarships going to foreigners, but what can we do, as a small island, we need more people, more minds/brains working together,... it is something we just have to accept.<br><br>But I do not dislike the Chinese govt/people as some Singaporeans do. They might sound arrogant at times, throwing their weight on the international arena, but you must know the decades they have spent being bullied by the rest of the world, the set back due to the "cultural revolution". With their improved standing, obviously they have to put it to the best use.<br><br>This is similar to what Malaysians had to put up with, in regards to Singaporeans in the late 70s and early 80s when we were way ahead of them in the economic game and obviously enjoy a constant airing of their inefficiencies and corrupt practices in our daily press. i.e. being insensitive and rude. Aren't we accusing the Chinese of a similar "crime"</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>For the record, I am from M'sia, and my ancestors are from China.<br><br>You talked about changes. Yes that's the whole point. Changes.<br>Westerners changed (invaded) the world in the 18th, 19th and 20th century into a western dominated world. We all had to live in that condition. I'm typing in English now. No one else in this world has the adaptability and survivability of the chinese race. We adapted to survice and thrive in this region. So don't misunderstand that I am against changes and adaptation.<br><br>But looking at the big picture, do you (or your grandchildren) want to continue living in such a western dominated world? Stop for a second and ponder these few points.<br><br>A western expatriate who knows less and works less harder than you, will in all likelyhood earn much more than you and become your boss. Just because they are born in US / Europe, the headquarters will send them here to become the CEO and upper management. No matter how good you are, most likely the highest you could ever reach is the regional head. That's it. And this is happening here in one of the most advanced Asian country. You might say hey SembCorp's boss is Singaporean! How many times have you ever heard of your fellow countrymen going to US/Europe to be the top management there? Even the native Singapore company Creative could not send a talent from Singapore to US to head the BRANCH office there, because they simply will not respect the authority.<br><br>Then you look at the fashion. The music. The movies. Asian artists all follow the style and trend from the western world. What they do, we follow after a short while. And yet we think wow we are hip and cool. That's the problem all over Asian nowadays. The inferiority complex. Look at the advertisement pictures, if there're more than 1 models in it, then you can bet that the white person is always going to be positioned at front and in the middle, while the blacks and asians are happily standing beside him/her.<br><br>Yes we have had to adapt to this condition for a few hundred years already. But now in this century, we have the opportunity to change things. We East Asians (most likely China) can lead the charge to change the very root of the imbalance world playing field, and make other people ADAPT to us. Just like it has been before the 18th century.<br><br>Anyone who has a problem with that, I don't know what to say to you. It's fine with me if you would like to see your children and your childrens' children adapt to the situation set by others. But I'd prefer us to be the ones seeting the situation.<br><br>PS: Btw, a lot of people complain about "arrogant" chinese. But do you complain about arrogant europeans or US? Because they are not arrogant? Tell me honestly that you don't look down on Chinese from mainland China. They don't deserve to be proud because they are not from europe? Remember one thing, the difference between mainland Chinese and Singapore-born Chinese is that they came here a bit later than your forefathers. How many of you have grandfathers born in Singapore?<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>You guys should try to check out the proposed J-12 fighter the PLAAF is planning to field by 2015. It looks suspiciously like an F-22A and bears no resemblance to any Chinese or Russian design I've seen so far. It will be the premier strike fighter of the PLAAF alongside the J-11 (Su-30MKK Flanker).<br><br>I only saw one pic while googling for it due to my busy schedule. It was only an artist's impression abeit of poor quality and not worthwhile to post here...</div>
