The author said that Singapore now opens its fourth taps, and Malaysia remains having one tap and they are having problem because of poor management, water prices went up due to privatization and the quality of water does not improve.<br><br>There are lessons learnt from such comparison, water sources are important but management of resources are more important; privatization does not necessarily mean higher quality; the continuing call to conserve water must be maintained and learn how singapor turns their weakness into strength and note how the other country turns from water exporting country to one who might need to import water.<br><br>We must also thank Malaysia for forcing us into water supplies development.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>With less depency on our Boleh neighbour for the precious H20, we can have more much more peaceful relationship with them. Water is always the basic need for human being, thus he will be jealously and zealously guard his water source, and let alone for sharing it. We cannot really blame our Boleh neighbour to be so calculating. Consider the fact that they have had been share the water with us for the past few decades. We should get ourselves independent on H20 issue, to prevent any deteriorating effect due to water supply in the future. In fact, the two countries should now be more focus on developing our common goods and face common challenges, rather than picking on minior issues and missed the big picture.<br><br>From historical point of view, many power city states had rose to power due to their promixmity to water sources like river. But as geopgraphical and climate changes, the water sources diminshed and the city states all went into the history book. One good example is the Rou Lan Kingdom in the Silk Road during the Tang Dynasty. Rou Lan Kingdom was powerful and rich due to her control of the ancient river and her status as a trade business centre, but as the population of the kingdom grew, the water sources diminished due to heavy usage by the local population and the distant travellers. Sounds familiar to our Singapore Story, right?<br><br>That is why our leader, MM Lee K Y, has a great foresight to focus on the development of water resource. When we was poor and tech backwards, we had embarked on a series of programme to educate the public on saving H20 and other infrastructure to collect more rainwater. When the opporunity comes, Sg embark on the ambitious H20 recycling tech research. The importance of readily available H20 supply will ensure the long term competetiveness of our country and essential for our survival. We should use water tech as a tool to open up Sg overseas investment effort, and also bring precious foregin direct investment into our country.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>If you look at the geographical info on our island, u will notice that Jurong area is a low laying are as compare to the surrounding place like Chua Chu kang, Bukit Timah and Lim Chu kang. Thus, Jurong can be a good catchment area for the run-off at the western part of Singapore.<br><br>We can already see that water formed a good part of business in our port activities. Tankers after tankers are queneing up in our port to top up food and water, while unloading/loading their goods for next destination.<br><br>If global warming presist well into mid 21 century, we may see china and india as a very very big market for water technologies. Already big cities like New Delhi, Beijing and Shanghai are facing some water crisis due to the some environmental / industrial issues.<br><br>I strongly support MM Lee foresight on developing the water tech in Singapore. We will need a good action plan and a cross ministry committee to look at how we can develope the water technologies and infrastructures in Singapore. If we can bring down the water cost, we may be a great location for foreign investors in the coming years. The land cost and labour cost in the China and India will continue to raise faster, and even catch up with us.<br><br>Currently, people is just looking at land cost and labour cost. But as you see, all high tech industrial needs high graded water and electricity &amp; well skilled labours as well. Singapore has very good electricity grid in our country, the labour are well skilled (can even source for foreign talents globlally to work in Sg), now if we can have a good supply of water at a reasonable cost, it will be a pull factor for us too.<br><br>Singapore has been working on the Space for quite sometimes. NTU and DSTA had been working on micro satellites. Even many of our neighbours (in both Far East, South Asia or even SE Asia) are planning to go Moon to visit Chang-re in 2020. Singapore as a responsible nation should also make use of our water recycling tech to get us some benefits from this round of "gold rush" to Moon in 2020. It could be a windfall for us, or even better if NASA could allow us to hike a ride by using our products in the Mission to Mars / Moon.</div>
