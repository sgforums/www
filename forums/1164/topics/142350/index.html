Keppel Integrated<br>Engineering chief executive Chua Chee Wui said his company would supply Newater to PUB at <strong>only 30 cents per cubic metre. </strong>This is believed to be lower than the cost at which PUB was producing Newater at the three older plants.</blockquote>STimes  13.07.05<br><br>How much you pay for water?Dunt be anger with PUB for it paid millions for infrastructures.We can solve water problems in our back yard.The reservoirs in the north is dispensable in the future,voluntarily.<br><br><strong>Dependency on Malaysia reduced from about 45% to 28 % in 2011</strong><br>Currently,Sg consumed about 500Mm3,million cubic meter per year.Few knows that only 45 % come from MY.It is one of the best kept secret!It is about 1,370,000m3 x 45%=620,000m3 per day come fr MY.<br><br><blockquote>The new Ulu Pandan plant will more than double Newater production capacity from 92,000 cubic metres per day to 208,000 cubic metres per day - enough to fill 104 Olympic-size swimming pools. A year ago, about 68,000 cubic metres of Newater were being used daily.<br>Mr Lim Chiow Giap, PUB's director for water supply plants, said the<br>production capacity of the new plant, at 116,000 cubic metres a day, is more<br>than the combined capacities of the three existing plants in Bedok, Kranji and<br>Seletar.</blockquote>With the completion of desalination plant(10% of yearlyconsumption),Marina Barrage,and inter-connectionof all reservoirs(55%x 14%=8%).<br><br>Projected sources of water supply in 2011,per day,in m3<br>Local catchment............740,000...m3<br>NEWater.......................208,000<br>Desalination.................134,000<br>Marina Reservoir............80,000<br>Reservoirs intergrated.100,000<br><br>Total local sources....1,262,000<br><br>Let say yearly increase in water consumption is 3%.Then in 2011,we need 1,740,000m3 per day.That is we need import 480,000m3 water from MY.<br>That is only 28% of our consumption in 2011.<br><br><strong>Advance in water reclamation technology </strong><br>It will make us less dependent  on MY beyond our imagination.Much of NEWater will be consumed by wafer fab factories(semi-conductors).They consume about 20% of Sg water!!<br><br>One desalination plant costs only $200m to build.We have plenty of land in Tuas and Changi East as big as three Changi airports.Resources to reclaim water has never been a issue .<br><br><strong>Water in north not easy to filter</strong><br><blockquote>RM1b to clean up rivers in Johor<br>Sim Bak Heng,New Strait Times<br><br>JOHOR BARU, June 5 2005<br>RM 1 billion. That is how much Johor needs to clean up the three most polluted rivers in the State.<br><br>Pos Malaysia The three rivers Â— Sungai Skudai, Sungai Tebrau and Sungai Segget Â— carry pollutants such as organic waste in the form of sewage water and garbage into the Johor Straits.<br><br>Besides the pollution, what makes the clean-up more expensive are the geographical locations of the respective river mouths.<br><br>For instance, the estuary of Sungai Segget is located at the Johor Baru city centre, the southern gateway to the peninsula.<br><br>The river mouth of Sungai Skudai is at the newly-developed tourism destination, Danga Bay, where a marina is to be built.<br><br>This explains why the State Government is willing to spend big money to clean up the rivers as the cost to be incurred later would be much higher if the ecology of the rivers is adversely affected.<br><br>State Tourism and Environment Committee chairman Freddie Long told the New Straits Times that the construction of a centralised sewage treatment system was the key to cleaner rivers.<br><br>"It is not going to be a cheap project.<br><br>"However, if we do not proceed with it now, it will become even more expensive," he said.<br><br>According to the State Department of Environment, the installation of a centralised sewage treatment system at Sungai Skudai would cost RM500 million, while those for Sungai Segget and Sungai Tebrau would cost another RM500 million.<br><br>Long said the system involved the laying of sewage pipes linked to a central treatment plant.<br><br>Sewage water would be treated at the plant before it was discharged into the rivers.<br><br>He said the Natural Resources and Environment Ministry had approved the project, while the Economic Planning Unit had set aside allocations for it to be implemented under the Ninth Malaysia Plan.<br><br>"We have completed a study on the design of the system.<br><br>"We are conducting a hydraulic study on the project. When everything is completed, we will appoint three consultants for the project. Each will be in charge of one river," he said.<br><br>Long said the project would also involve urban land acquisition.</blockquote>The rivers names sound familiar?Yes,some of our water come  from there.<br><br>Cheers to water independent---with  NEWater of course!!</div>
