Or could it be in your hurry to dismiss any sucessful American action as propangada you missed out the important details? Please read the posts properly before you shoot off one-liners.<br><br>I'm sure we are all quite aware on what transpired with Pvy. Jessica Lynch, but it seems that you are so fixated on that story that you fail to realize that there are plenty of female combatants in the US armed forces that have far better, and more amazing stories to tell.<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by LRRP:</div><div class="quote_body">Yeah..she admitted she never even fired a shot in ambush and passed out before before she can react..</div></blockquote>You are mixing up Pvt. Jessica Lynch with Sgt. Leigh Ann Hester. Sgt. Leigh Ann Hester was awarded a silver star for her actions during an ambush on a convoy.<br><br><a href="http://www.defenselink.mil/news/Jun2005/20050616_1745.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.defenselink.mil/news/Jun2005/20050616_1745.html</a><br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">WASHINGTON, June 16, 2005 Â– For the first time since World War II, a woman soldier was awarded the Silver Star Medal today in Iraq.<br><br>Sgt. Leigh Ann Hester of the 617th Military Police Company, a National Guard unit out of Richmond, Ky., received the Silver Star, along with two other members of her unit, Staff Sgt. Timothy Nein and Spc. Jason Mike, for their actions during an enemy ambush on their convoy. Other members of the unit also received awards.<br><br>Hester's squad was shadowing a supply convoy March 20 when anti-Iraqi fighters ambushed the convoy. The squad moved to the side of the road, flanking the insurgents and cutting off their escape route. Hester led her team through the "kill zone" and into a flanking position, where she assaulted a trench line with grenades and M203 grenade-launcher rounds. She and Nein, her squad leader, then cleared two trenches, at which time she killed three insurgents with her rifle.<br><br>When the fight was over, 27 insurgents were dead, six were wounded, and one was captured.<br><br>Hester, 23, who was born in Bowling Green, Ky., and later moved to Nashville, Tenn., said she was surprised when she heard she was being considered for the Silver Star.<br><br>"I'm honored to even be considered, much less awarded, the medal," she said.<br><br>Being the first woman soldier since World War II to receive the medal is significant to Hester. But, she said, she doesn't dwell on the fact. "It really doesn't have anything to do with being a female," she said. "It's about the duties I performed that day as a soldier."<br><br>Hester, who has been in the National Guard since April 2001, said she didn't have time to be scared when the fight started, and she didn't realize the impact of what had happened until much later.<br><br>"Your training kicks in and the soldier kicks in," she said. "It's your life or theirs. ... You've got a job to do -- protecting yourself and your fellow comrades."<br><br>Nein, who is on his second deployment to Iraq, praised Hester and his other soldiers for their actions that day. "It's due to their dedication and their ability to stay there and back me up that we were able to do what we did that day," he said.<br><br>Hester and her fellow soldiers were awarded their medals at Camp Liberty, Iraq, by Army Lt. Gen. John R. Vines, Multinational Corps Iraq commanding general. In his speech, Vines commended the soldiers for their bravery and their contribution to the international war on terror.<br><br>"My heroes don't play in the (National Basketball Association) and don't play in the U.S. Open (golf tournament) at Pinehurst," Vines said. "They're standing in front of me today. These are American heroes."<br><br>Three soldiers of the 617th were wounded in the ambush. Hester said she and the other squad members are thinking about them, and she is very thankful to have made it through unscathed. The firefight, along with the entire deployment, has had a lasting effect on her, Hester said.<br><br>"I think about it every day, and probably will for the rest of my life," she said. </span><br><br>Any questions?</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Its Jessica Lynch. Read all about this from the old war horse, Hack. He even phoned the Pentagon to contest the award.<br><br><a href="http://www.worldnetdaily.com/news/article.asp?ARTICLE_ID=34272" rel="nofollow">http://www.worldnetdaily.com/news/article.asp?ARTICLE_ID=34272</a><br><br>Using Jessica Lynch<br>Posted: August 26, 2003<br>1:00 a.m. Eastern<br><br>Jessica Lynch recently was awarded a Bronze Star Medal, a Purple Heart and the POW Medal. The BSM citation reads: "For exemplary courage under fire during combat operations to liberate Iraq, in support of Operation Iraqi Freedom. Private First Class Lynch's bravery and heart persevered while surviving in the ambush and captivity in An Nasiriya."<br><br>A BSM for "bravery" and "surviving in the ambush and captivity"!<br><br>The Army's official After-Action Report said she was in a vehicle that crashed while hauling butt trying to escape an enemy ambush. She was knocked unconscious and woke up at a nearby Iraqi hospital receiving special attention from some super-caring Iraqi doctors and nurses.<br><br>This was probably the first incident in U.S. military history in which an American soldier was awarded our country's fourth-highest ground-fighting award for being conked out and off the air throughout a fight.<br><br>BSMs citing bravery typically read: "Moving his machine gun to a forward vantage point, he covered the advance of the infantry with a heavy volume of effective fire. Repeatedly exposing himself to a devastating small-arms automatic weapons and mortar barrage ..." Or: "He voluntarily acted as point man and ... when the platoon was fired upon ... charged the enemy position ... Through his courage, determination and devotion to duty, he saved his patrol from suffering casualties and captured a prisoner who later provided important information."<br><br>It's no big surprise that I've been bombarded by thousands of angry e-mails from vets protesting this assault on our country's sacred award system.<br><br>"She wasn't wounded in action, nor did she do anything to deserve a Bronze Star," writes Arch McNeill. "We have hundreds of valiant soldiers here in the 3rd Division who far more deserve more than she received but in many cases didn't receive anything."<br><br>"I'm going to send all my awards back to the president and tell him where he can shove them," says a genuine war hero, Jack Speed, a former Army Raider.<br><br>Trust me, the troops Â– past and present Â– are unhappy.<br><br>So I rang the Pentagon and asked Col. Jeff Keane, "Why the bravery bit?" Finally, when the standard Army propaganda drill wasn't going down, Keane told me, " It was for her bravery in the hospital."<br><br>But all this flimflam wasn't Jessica's doing. She was used right from the first Â– a frail prop in the Pentagon's public-relations campaign to sell the war to the American people and to encourage their daughters to join up and be heroes.<br><br>To keep the truth under wraps, the Army concocted another whopper: "She suffers from amnesia."<br><br>A senior officer from V Corps (the unit that eventually awarded her the BSM), who has asked to remain anonymous, comments that there was "tremendous pressure right from the get-go to award Pvt. Lynch a Silver Star. But the high brass here concluded, 'There was no evidence of heroism on her part,' and told the pushers to back off."<br><br>But when the propagandists conned the highly respected Washington Post into reporting on how Lynch was shot and stabbed but continued to kill Iraqis until her last round was spent, heroic stuff that would make Audie Murphy look like a slacker Â– which the Post then took several months to correct Â– other media were fast to pick up the fairy tale, and the Army was besieged by proud Americans demanding that Jessica be awarded the Medal of Honor.<br><br>Of course, many of us now know that a high-priced flack in Tommy Frank's headquarters came up with this tall tale and then duped the Post.<br><br>According to retired Marine Lt. Col. Roger Charles: "There's nothing they won't stoop to spin. The Army needed a female hero to boost female recruiting and PR efforts, so they went and invented one."<br><br>And that's the root of the problem. The elevation of Jessica to Joan of Arc status is to recruit more women, even though thousands of female soldiers couldn't deploy with their units to Iraq because of pregnancy, no sitters for single moms' multiple kids and other problems.<br><br>And poor Jessica Lynch has become the unwitting poster girl for an Army of One that's fast becoming an Army of Two Â– since apparently more than half of the women deployed to Iraq are now pregnant.[[/url]</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Why is it when one thinks of US female combatants Jessica Lynch is the only thing so many people know? There are plenty of other more worthy stories of the fighting women in Iraq, and if one wants to get a true picture of everything, those stories are worth taking into account as well.<br><br>AFAIK, the Jessica Lynch incident and the resulting politics and propangada was a slap in the face to many of the other combatant units and they aren't that happy about it. Her unit got many more bronze stars and purple hearts then other units that took far more fire and seen more action. The grunts on the ground are hardly blind to this so called "US-Propangada".<br><br>The truth is it's just an effect of the news on a general public mostly ignorant of the war, and the incident took on a life of its own. If they really wanted Propangada material it would be so much better to play up Sgt. Hester's exploits.<br><br>There are REAL stories of heroism worth finding out about... why fixate on Jessica Lynch and crop it up as a highly ignorant point everytime someone is talking about something entirely different?</div>

However, to be fair, the higher level of grumblings today may also be attributable to the freely available number of conduits with which to vent one's frustration. When I was enlisted back in '87, I wanted to grumble, whine, curse, swear, cuss etc etc so badly, but alas there was no internet in those days... So I have no choice but to grit my teeth and bear it.<br><br>Whereas today, the channel for one to grumble is just a mouse click away.... It is also not necessarily a bad thing for younger conscripts to grumble... It is a form of stress release.</div>

Its always people saying that nowadays the young people so nua, so slack, so useless and cant even take any stress at all.<br><br>I definitely do no see any thing wrong with the conscripts complaining. Its not like they volunteer to be doing that. I wonder how people who say that conscripts are too soft would like to have the training conducted? By dunking in water? Perhaps they ought to sign on before saying anything. Who is to say that Taiwan and Korean conscript are not soft and they do not complain at all. I also can wayang till I super garang soldier.<br><br>I have ORD-ed and certainly it would be so easy for me to say that the conscript are too slack and training to easy because it would not be me who will have to undergo it and also in war it makes me feel safer but I certainly feel its not right.</div>

It seems that you are making a lot of bizzare statements about our so-called more questioning soldiers. Were you a commander in a combat unit recently?<br><br>AFAIK, from MY experience, our current THINK more about things and provide feedback. But at the end of the day they still know what the do when it comes down to the job. And I think that's a good thing. Our men currently want to know if their commander really knows the stuff he is talking worthy of their respect about or if he's just talking out of his butt and giving orders to appear "commanding".<br><br>Soldiers that do not understand their orders, follows it all blindly, or does not understand where it all fits into the bigger picture is at best a dumb asset on the battlefield micromanaged by their commander.<br><br>The way you make it sound is as if our soldiers question every single thing they do and do not get it done. Which from my experience, does not happen. What is happening is that they actually want to UNDERSTAND what they are doing instead of just being told to go here and there and do this and that.<br><br>Is that a good thing? Yes. I would prefer a soldier who questions if I have accounted for the enemy sightings in the next block a few hours ago when I give him the order to move around the next corner. It is a lot better then him simply nodding and going about the thing.<br><br>More minds working on the problem is always a better thing, as long as the commander maintains the last word in the end.</div>

Dun be silly. There is a difference between this situation and asking why they have to fall in at 0530 only to find that the bus only leaves at 0730.<br><br>Btw, you do know that since the Nuremberg Trial, simply saying "I was following orders" does not absolve the soldier of responsiblity for his actions right?</div>
