However, as one only need to take a basic lesson of history and learn from personal accounts that the Allies (the Yanks and Tommies in question), also made up for their technological shortcomings by exploiting other areas in which they had an advantage over the Jerries, as well as coming up with tatics to make up for some of their technological and qulatitive inferiorites... lots of deciding factors that had little to do with numbers.<br><br>Am I contradicting myself? Of simply being able to see all the shades of colour in a painting including the one that you seem to think the whole painting is made out of?<br><br>Also, this topic is drifting off topic. Your original assumption was that the Yanks and Tommies, being inferior in morale and discipline, and mental toughness then the Jerries, could only win by trading blood for victory... a point which I think that others beyond me has pointed out as flawed from beginning to end.<br><br>I await your reply, and am interested to know if it will actually contain arguments of substance instead of childish insults and dishonest facts, which I am afriad to say, hardly helping your case at all.</div>

I mean seriously, not insulting you but you just like erm, made several huge errors of comprehension in your quotes and post.<br><br>I'm not sure if it is deliberate, but in the case that it is I suggest you seriously think about deliberate misunderstanding of your opponents' position as an effective tatic in debate. I mean sure it allows you to avoid the issues and wastes your opponent's time in adressing things that have little to bear with the true debate but it has some serious shortcomings that limit its usefulness.<br><br>HOWEVER one also needs to know that this only works best in personal debate and not a public one as this. For others will rapidly start to see the person using deliberate misunderstanding as somewhat of a lamer, and quite quickly he will be discredited (a bit like Glock's case, but I suspect he simply lacked the ability to comprehend any basic logic that was in the way of his ideas).<br><br>You seem to make the fatal error of seeming to think when your opponent assumes your position (which is a common pratice in debate) as an actual pitching of it.<br><br>Hence please reread the giraffe-dog point...

Even if I wasn't here to contradict you, others would almost certainly pick up that mantle quite quickly.<br><br>And why are you trying to satire the Hurtgen Forest? The Americans made the assumption that the Germans were not going to hold the line and would withdraw, and were then surprised by the defences that the Germans had prepared there which included a lot more then just armour. This was not to mention that in retrospect it the value of the whole battle was questionable to begin with.<br><br>So yes, all this in mind... how does it even begin to support your point? When the Americans said that the whole battle was a waste of lives, they weren't saying lives were wasted due to them being inferior and unable to trump the Germans in quality, they were talking about the whole affair being rather pointless to begin with.<br><br>In that vein, even if they had taken less losses then the Germans, they still would have considered that battle a waste of lives.<br><br>So yes, it does not support your cause at all, but I thought that was obvious to anybody with a bit of comprehension of historical facts.<br><br>And how come you seem to think the only thing that matters in every single battle in the ETO is Sherman vs. German tanks?<br><br>So as it stands, I'm afraid you still have yet to prove your orginal point of the more disciplined, "high morale" German losing to the Yanks only because of numbers... which by all indications wasn't the case.<br><br>Please ah, I think one Glock in military nuts is enough liao... dun need to be another.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Chill out guys. Keep the discussion objective lar.<br><br>Just an additional side note.  It seems that the Germans were good at fighting defensively in depth, than launching quick blitzkrieg than led to believe.<br><br>As for high morale and discipline for the Post-Normandy German army, I don't really think so. They were getting their supply and war material manufacturing bombed all the way to Berlin, hence their morale couldn't have been fantastic either.<br><br>However, I feel that what made the German's a "tougher" army was eventually not just the vehicles.  But the fact that it was a more evolved army at that time in terms of organization and training. And that is taken from General Fayolle in 1916 where he wrote, "The great superiority of the German Army lies in its instructional methods and in its organization."<br><br>It was better organized and as a result had a more de-centralized command that allowed it to react faster to fluid situations.  In most cases, the German army were able to make precise counter attacks, from defense to offense, as well as switch operations tempo simply because its Army and leadership were better trained and better educated.<br><br>If thats what you constitute as a tougher soldier, perhaps in a way you are right then.</div>

The Americans made the assumption that the Germans were not going to hold the line and would withdraw, and were then surprised by the defences that the Germans had prepared there which included a lot more then just armour. This was not to mention that in retrospect it the value of the whole battle was questionable to begin with. </blockquote>see? you agree with me... then suddenly you wrote this below...<br><br><blockquote>So yes, all this in mind... how does it even begin to support your point? When the Americans said that the whole battle was a waste of lives, they weren't saying lives were wasted due to them being inferior and unable to trump the Germans in quality, they were talking about the whole affair being rather pointless to begin with. </blockquote>if it was pointless why pour so many men there? now we are getting closer.<br><br><blockquote>In that vein, even if they had taken less losses then the Germans, they still would have considered that battle a waste of lives. </blockquote>again you just support my point. life were wasted unnecassarily. Then again you wrote even more confusing thing like below...<br><br><blockquote>So yes, it does not support your cause at all, but I thought that was obvious to anybody with a bit of comprehension of historical facts. </blockquote><blockquote>And how come you seem to think the only thing that matters in every single battle in the ETO is Sherman vs. German tanks? </blockquote>i didnt say its the only things matter. But the tommycooker did get owned because of its inferiority and the tiger where overwhelmed and outnumber by the american from ground and above regardless of its superiority and ability to kill a lot of the allied.<br><br><blockquote>So as it stands, I'm afraid you still have yet to prove your orginal point of the more disciplined, "high morale" German losing to the Yanks only because of numbers... which by all indications wasn't the case. </blockquote>i didnt link the two. i say the german were more diciplined and are tougher in terms of mental, quality of equipment and tactics. Yet they lose.<br><br>then i say the allied use overwhelming number of men and equipment to counter the german superiority. Thats why they won.<br><br>if you remmember i say...'superb hardtrained soldier won battle. But dont make war if you have just a few of them..' i say battle not war.<br><br><blockquote>Please ah, I think one Glock in military nuts is enough liao... dun need to be another.</blockquote>in the end you have to insult me again, aafter all that craap about no insult during debate.</div>

Even well-organized armies who do not rely on attrition sometimes find themselves fighting such a conflict on an ad-hoc basis when things don't turn out their way.

If you account for all the losses in the battles, and the fact that the Allies were often on the offensive versus a well-defended foe, I find it hard to understand your point that the Yanks and Tommies can only win after taking heavy losses in ratio to the Germans.

You must realize that I am not even attempting to argue with you, merely letting your increasingly desperate antics bounce off and reveal themselves for the flawed arguments that they really are.<br><br>Truly, you are your own worst enemy.<br><br><blockquote>the german dont have enough man power to die like that, hence the in depth defence and counter attack were carefully executed. Unsuccessful most of the time because of the odd that the allied smack towards them.</blockquote>Ney, only in Normady were they severely outnumbered, and thanks in part to Allied misdirection as well. And one needs to account for the fact that the Allies did not commit all of their 1.4mil men that landed by July 25 into direct fighting with the Germans, a large proportion of that were landed men and equipment that were not thrown into the fight.<br><br>Also if you look at the committed forces in the other battles, the Allies rarely achieved the 3:1 ratio that military doctrine demands for the numerical superiority for a reasonably successful attack. Note that 3:1 assumes that both sides are of equal quality and equipment.<br><br>Even in the Battle of Berlin, when it was about to be over the Soviets committed a ratio of 2.5 to 1. And in the Hurtgen you so like the Allies badly under-committed (due to poor intelligence on enemy strength) to the battle, with a paltry ratio of 1.5:1!<br><br>In Market Garden they under-committed again with a ratio of 1.75:1.<br><br>In Dragoon, the Allies managed a strategic victory once again versus the German defenders with only a 2:1 advantage, still under the magic ratio of 3:1! Note that this is only a mere 0.5 and 0.25 more then Hurtgen and Market Garden.<br><br>Of course on the other hand when the Ardennes Offensive started, the Germans had an advantage of 2.4:1 on the Allies, coupled with stragetic surprise, lack of Allied airpower, as well as the Â“superiorÂ” technology and morale you seem to base a lot of your points on.<br><br>Yet they were unable to achieve their objectives and eventually ended up with an rather even 1.05:1 kill ratio.<br><br>What all this shows is that there is a lot of other factors that go into victory beyond sheer numbers versus Technology. Technological deficiencies can be made up for not only through numbers, but prudent stragety and playing into your inherent advantages.<br><br>Sun Tzu reconized this principle well enough when he wrote the Art of War, which wasnÂ’t focused around pitting numbers against numbers but a lot on how to manage and set yourself up for victory.<br><br>In fact if you look at many of the battles in WW2 (or actually a lot of battles before and after that), youÂ’ll find that often a lot of the results do not tally with what we would expect from warfare being a numbers games. This certainly wasnÂ’t the case in WW2 where sometimes the Allies won big, and in other cases they lost big irregardless of their numbers. Ditto for the Axis.<br><br>In fact the point is so obvious that I have yet to see any serious attempt to explain the Axis defeat as purely due to numbers beyond Neo-Nazi forums. The Yanks and Tommies fought beyond their numbers, considering what they were up against.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote> You must be his mother.

You donÂ’t really seem to get itÂ… itÂ’s not you versus me, and hence all your references to my mother is actually hurting your credibility, not mine.<br><br>ItÂ’s a mystery why you choose to debate in such a fashion, but I suspect it might be because you are so hung up on numbers, that you assume the person who manages to post to the bitter end can be considered the winner.<br><br>Believe me, if you next post consists mostly of your usual nonsense, there is really no need to reply to you anymore for there are certainly more productive things to do with time. You need to seriously think about how to actually win a debate, for it seem the only person losing your mind (considering how quickly you draw peopleÂ’s mothers in debate) might be you.<br><br>For me, I might just sit back and enjoy your show.<br></div>
