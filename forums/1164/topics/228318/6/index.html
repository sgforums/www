            <div class='col-md body'>I believe that both conscripts and regular armies have their own unique strength and weaknesses. We also cannot argue the fact that hill-billy will definitely trash a city bred kid in combat......<br><br>Back in my NSF days, I have the chance to train with Royal Thai army. These man are from the King's Guards airborne battalion and they are made up of entriely regulars and all of them have many years of airborne operation experience. Even the platoon medic being a few yrs older than us, is airborne trained with many jumps, and the entire battalion on the whole is very fit, tough, especially fighting in vegetations in LCK, their attacks are solid and rapid.<br><br>But..........when it comes to Fibua, they totally suck. Most of them looked confused, lost, and were literally running abt without adequate fire-cover. They clear rooms very slowly, thus giving the opfor to escape to other connecting rooms.<br><br>Thus, can we say SAF troops are weak just bcos we are getting wad the lao jiao seems as weak training? NO! Why are coy acting as the enemy managed to kill so many of their troops, is bcos, many of us are motivated to 'give the thais' a hard time, thus we went through many creative ways to attack them, that includes hiding in large drains, water towers and in the structures of a playground. SAF didn't put this in the training manuals, but we did it with our own initiative.<br><br>In fact, we are so effective that the Thai observing officer is overly impress, and the umpire have to call our MG to cease fire to let the thais move in, as the MG killed too many of them......... We also have very little Fibua training prior to that exercise.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Actually I don't think we will know the true mettle of the SAF until the bullets start flying like in Black Hawk Down...<br><br>What we can hope is that the training we are giving our soldiers equips them with the proper skills to survive and respond in a battle, that they will not break ranks, or cower in fear and cry for mommy.<br><br>But it's another thing entirely to say that our conscripts <span style="font-style: italic;">must and will </span>break under stress just because the training now is not as abusive as that of last time... that is another question entirely.<br><br>I think I fear more the bad choices that upper brass will make rather then the ground level troops not having the will to fight.</div>

I for one doubt that Singapore is exactly the kind that sits around with simmering tensions and war mongering for long without doing something to tilt it in either way.</div>

We also cannot argue the fact that hill-billy will definitely trash a city bred kid in combat......<br><br>Back in my NSF days, I have the chance to train with Royal Thai army. These man are from the King's Guards airborne battalion and they are made up of entriely regulars and all of them have many years of airborne operation experience. Even the platoon medic being a few yrs older than us, is airborne trained with many jumps, and the entire battalion on the whole is very fit, tough, especially fighting in vegetations in LCK, their attacks are solid and rapid.<br><br>But..........when it comes to Fibua, they totally suck. Most of them looked confused, lost, and were literally running abt without adequate fire-cover. They clear rooms very slowly, thus giving the opfor to escape to other connecting rooms.<br><br>Thus, can we say SAF troops are weak just bcos we are getting wad the lao jiao seems as weak training? NO! Why are coy acting as the enemy managed to kill so many of their troops, is bcos, many of us are motivated to 'give the thais' a hard time, thus we went through many creative ways to attack them, that includes hiding in large drains, water towers and in the structures of a playground. SAF didn't put this in the training manuals, but we did it with our own initiative.<br><br>In fact, we are so effective that the Thai observing officer is overly impress, and the umpire have to call our MG to cease fire to let the thais move in, as the MG killed too many of them......... We also have very little Fibua training prior to that exercise.</div></blockquote>if you guys wanted to give the thais a hard timethen shouldn't show them sure tactics so they remain weak.<br><br>now that you ahve shown them then they will learn and improve. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_confused.gif" alt="Confused" title="Confused"></div>
