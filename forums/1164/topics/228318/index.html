ROK sent three divisions of troops to Vietnam beginning to help the Americans fight against North Vietnam. The "White Horse," "Blue Dragon," and the "Tiger" divisions totaled more than 300,000 men over a twelve year period.<br><br>Below is a quote from wikipedia on the ROK marine corp:<br><br>"Most of the operations never exceeded battalion-size, but they also conducted divisional size operations. Before conducting missions, Koreans laid out their plans much more carefully than their allies, with greater fire discipline, the very effective use of fire support, and better co-ordination of sub-units. They also had to their favor the distinguished combat leadership of the company and platoon commanders. During village searches, ROK soldiers would subject the settlement to a series of detailed sweeps while interrogating subjects on the spot. By comparison, American units tended to favor a single sweep followed by a removal of all civilians for screening. Such a painstaking approach certainly paid dividends in terms of weapons seizures and reduced VC activity in ROK areas. Koreans quickly learned pidgin Vietnamese language; for fear that most Vietnamese translators were spies for Vietcong and NVA. Koreans also had better field intelligence than their American counterparts. Koreans conducted counterinsurgency operations so well that American commanders felt Korean AOR was the safest. This was further supported when Vietcong documents captured after the Tet Offensive warned their compatriots to never engage Koreans until full victory is certain. In fact, it was often that the NVA and Vietcong were ambushed by Koreans and not vice versa.<br><br>Their most notable operations in Vietnam were "Operation Van Buren" and the Battle of Hoi An. During "Operation Van Buren", a ROKMC platoon of about 13 soldiers wiped out an elite North Vietnamese Army regiment, resulting in only 2 Korean casualties while more than 400 NVA soldiers were killed. The initial gun battle had devolved into bloody hand-to-hand combat. The ROKMC boasted an overall kill ratio of 25-to-1 in the Vietnam War"</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I agree with some of you that Korea and Taiwan have much worse problem than us. Younger generation of Taiwanese see no point in fighting against the Chinese the other side. The wai shen ren really don't want to fight for ah bian. Korean teenagers are used to comfort and good life, and they don't believe they can fight against the north korean soldiers that are trained out of hardship.

            <div class='col-md body'>Actually I think this is perception based mentality that SG being a small country, far away from war zone will naturally have lax training.<br>I have read memoirs from a rifleman from the 28th inf div of US fighting in Europe during WW2. Most of their senior commands are made up of full timers while the junior officers and grunts are part timers. The soldier quote saying he dunno how he made it, he just came out of it alive. In his memoirs, u will be shocked at how little operational skills he learnt before going to Europe. He for example never touch before a real bazooka and did no life firing from it. They just issue a broomstick for them to simulate the bazooka. No doubt being a green horn, the division grapple their way and in turn slowly gained actual combat experiences. Of course, on the way, many soldiers perished. At least we learnt battalion movement and exercise before we ORD thats gd, for sure.<br><br>I believe wad is impt is not how much injuries or abuse one sustain during training, so as to gauge how gd the training is. It is more impt to teach the RELEVANT SOFT SKILL and RELEVANT FIGHTING TACTICS THAT IS UP TO DATE.<br>For example, during my time, they CO advocate shoot kill move tactics and leopard crawling in midst of chaos near enemy fire trench to conduct an assault is a veri good move, compared to the four second rule enforced in BMTC. Dun just judge some stuff by the exterior. For example, I visisted some Taiwanese military forum and read some stuff they wrote about SG conscripts. True, Taiwanese troopers are beefier and have greater physical strength. But they admit basic infantry tactics like patrols, local defense are much weaker than us. Another guy quote their artillery drills are slower to fire the first shot and their system is not that efficient.</div>

The role of BMTC has changed into a place where civilians are slowly integrated into military life. BMTC does not make soldiers, it makes military trainees, to prepare them for further advanced/vocational training which will transform them into soldiers.<br><br>I don't see tankees, arty gunners coming here to complain much.</div>
