When it comes to the US, its navy and air force are its stronger components. Because of the fact that the US is protected on both sides by two oceans and a rather short border with Mexico( the border with Canada non-militarized), there isn't really a need for a large army, unlike China or Russia.

            <div class='col-md body'>hmm..<br><br>for someone who have been in service for the past 8 yrs, i believe im in a fair position to give some comments.<br><br>although fact is that training did indeed go softer and the younger generation have also grow weaker in the lieu of Singapore's current peace and prosperity + the new generation parent's upbringing.  With changing times and growing wealth + with parents and youngsters getting more well educated, let us face the facts that future generations will probably be worst off and there will probably be more problems.<br><br>And most of these problems are beyond the goverment, SAF or anyone in authority.  However we must remind ourselves this is something we have to live with it.  And since we have to live with it, let us try to look at things in a positive way~ Things might change for the better if there is a pending war or catastrope, but until then who knows how things might go?<br><br>( by then maybe my son will only need to serve 1 yr or no need to serve liao??)  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_twisted.gif" alt="Twisted Evil" title="Twisted Evil"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Singaporean male is mainly sedentary unlike in US , Australia or many Western countries. Many boys in these countries pride themselves in excelling in sports such as football , basketball, surfing, skiing, extreme sports etc. It is in their culture / lifestyle - we do not have a culture / lifestyle where many boys engage in contact sports or even sports in general.<br>When engaged in sporting activities, one develops the competitive and fightin spirit ,teamwork and quick thinking besides physical &amp; mental conditioning.<br>Hence , physically we are softies compared to others.<br><br>However, NS does give us more than basic skills and know how to conduct combat operations.  It also conditions us physically and mentally. Without NS, we  are even worse of. However, all developed countries face problems with a young generation who are more sedentary compared to  the older generation. However, more importantly is what is in the mind - fighting spirit, determination and will. History is replete with examples of fighters having these qualities who victor over their more numerous, " tougher " or technologically advanced enemies.</div>

But most major American military actions involve them sending in their ground forces... and one also needs to know that they don't exactly tailor their forces for defensive homeland operations, but rather power and policy projection. They need a solid ground force to do that.<br><br>I don't see anything really wrong with their grunts. They can fight, and they are certainly far better then stuff the Ruskies throw at the insurgents in Gronzy, and they have been dishing out a lot more damage then they are taking when in the level firefights that they have been involved in. That's pretty good by any books. They have decent grunts that can get the job done.</div>
