            <div class='col-md body'>I'll have to agree with Shotgun, this debate will head nowhere because it is apparent the two of us deal with the same facts and data differently. This has become mostly an issue of semantics, thought somehow thanks to your constant evasion of some rather pertinent questions. It seems that you are just interested in taking about raw numbers, but not what they really mean so it has become apparent that such a person cannot be convinced of his folly otherwise, not anymore then a madman can be convinced that he is not a basketball and the world are not the same because they are both round. As such, I also find it rather amusing to leave you to your folly.<br><br>Just that I have to add that your approach is quite contary to how most historians view the whole issue of WW2.<br><br>So really, it's up to you to keep to your revisionist style of dealing with historicial data, but I think I'll keep to the tried and tested method, thank you very much.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Am I trying to be a lawyer or threatening you? What I am telling you is simply a matter of fact- if you slander someone expect to get into trouble with the court of law.<br><br>The truth is, people have been hauled from here and made to answer for certain things they have said in here before, most recently, one dude was in here making several slanderous remarks about religions and individuals and suddenly the mods of the forums he posted in were contacted by the police and told to provide evidence and testimony, as well as asked if they intended to press charges against that guy for what he posted.<br><br>Fortunately for that dude, they decided to settle it out of court, probably out of consideration for his family.<br><br>Also, one guy was in here using clones and attempting to smear the reputation of Meridian JC for some reason, when he realized that he was being investigated for the prank he pulled, he PMed the forumnites and mods begging them to remove the posts that he made (and their replies as well).<br><br>He was ignored. We havenÂ’t heard from since then, and all this just happened early this year.<br><br>Even more recently a dude was in here making plenty of big and negative statements in Australia, offending the Singaporeans staying there, as well as just about anybody and everything about Australia. That guy was also taken to task for many of the things he said.<br><br>These are just a few examples of the things that have happened in hereÂ… not to mention the numerous other cases where some dude thought it was fun to launch a smear attack on another individual and realized their prank had legal consequences.<br><br>Am I threatening you? No I am telling you- if you really want to carry down the line of argument that I am using a clone, you jolly well, for your own sake have proper evidence to back it up or else you might find yourself in hot soup.<br><br>If you want to prove it, just ask the mods to help you check and they will be more then happy to help to nail a clone. But I suspect you will be sorely dissapointed.<br><br>Truth is, you can indeed get into trouble with the law if you make an untrue or groundless statement attempting to question the integrity, honesty, goodwill and reputation of another person be it in real life or cyberspace.<br><br>What is your defense against the judge going to be? ItÂ’s your Freedom of speech to recklessly say whatever you like about others?<br><br>I'll say this again: I do not use clones, and you trying to follow this line of arguing unfortunately... is one that will ultimately have serious consquences on yourself.<br><br>So am I threatening you or are you not your own greatest threat? In your desire to win any argument you have recklessly rushed into troubles that are not worth this debate.<br><br><blockquote>are you a lawyer?<br><br>so if i say 'your mother a ^&amp;*%^', its an insult. But if i say 'i could say your mother a ^&amp;*%^' im off the hook? </blockquote>Did I even, in my post directly insult your mother? Or intend to insult your mother?<br><br>Is this not an example of you trying to take hypothetical statements out of their context to assume they are a personal insult?<br><br>I am no lawyer, but what I can tell you quite simply is this:<br>In a court of law, my statements will be taken in their entire context- it will be immediately clear that I had never any intention nor purpose of insulting your mother and that quote (which was even largely inoffensive to begin with), was an HYPOTHETICAL EXAMPLE to referring to another thing entirely. You case will be thrown out entirely.<br><br>On the other hand, unfortunately the things you did are quite obviously, and directly an insult intended to cause mockery and harm.<br><br>So IÂ’m afraid you are no the lower ground here. I never had, nor ever had, any intention of insulting your mother and my words made it clear- it is your unreasonable oversensitivity that led to all this, including the very ones with possible legal ramifications of defaming me (for using clones) and insulting my mother.<br><br>So really, you can carry on playing with fire if you want. It seems my job has shifted from answering you to collecting evidence in your words.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>As I said, the context and intent of the useage of the terms related to "mother" can be easily infered from your posts.
