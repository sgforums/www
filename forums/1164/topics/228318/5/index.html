Much less talk about it, and about basically the only thing you know- which is rather little and insufficent for discussion.<br><br>And it does not take much to find out more about this, just trawl around the net or even drop by Strategy Page to see what some of the Yank grunts are saying about the whole thing and how it's really run there. You focus on lynching Jessica Lynch in hopelessly small pictured, as much as it is an ironic pun.<br><br><blockquote><strong>It is almost impossible that Basic did not teach them/her to clean their/her weapons and to fire back when attacked. Maybe no convoy drills were taught but firing back when fired upon almost certainly has been taught. </strong></blockquote>Being taught to clean your weapon and knowing the weapon TH is VERY different from normal field discipline and routine, which by all means is enforced at unit level. If a Guardsman does not clean his weapon the question is raised with the OC or CO of that unit, not BMTC where the soldier orginally came along.<br><br>Unit culture is extremely important in making sure some things get done. Should every soldier clean their weapon? Yes. Should every soldier know what to do when the stuff hits the fan? Of course. But in the end the thing that really makes this drilled into the soldier is the culture and training of the unit.<br><br>You don't give a girl a rifle for the first few weeks of boot, then post her to a unit where more or less they have a mentality that fighting will not come to them and think that no bad habits or sloppy soldiering should develop. Once again as I point out, your focus on the alleged sloppy soldiering of Jessica Lynch is hopelessly microfocused... the real problem was with her commanders and her unit.<br><br><blockquote><strong>That girl said her rifle couldn't fire because it was jammed and she curled up somewhere crying (not sure about the crying bit it just came to my mind). I do agree that she should not have been given a medal but these are the yanks we are talking about - even Popov36 (Gus Kohntopp) got a medal so as can be seen this is not against the run of things in the US. It is a media war as much as it is about guns and bullets.<br><br>And I am frankly not surprised that the convoy was routed in such a way... if all you got is very basic training in contact reactions and drills, your main job is ferrying stuff around, and this is your first time in a firefight it is not surprising you will end up being unable to fight. Do you seriously think the Pes C clerk at S1 could defend himself if HQ got attacked? And what's more do you think your army driver really knows the value of keeping his weapon clean like the normal grunt who knows firsthand what happens when you IA in the heat of battle?<br><br>At the end of the day blaming individuals isn't going to help the situtation when the pattern is generated higher up, and that's where you should really be talking.<br><br>Your focus on Jessica Lynch simply because (as you admitted) you don't know enough about the subject and have some limited valid points to make (which is about the whole of your case) sounds a lot like a person sometime back that insisted on very limited knowledge and circular logic that the SAR-21 could be "improved" when the very improvements he "invented" already existed and the "problem" (if there was any to begin with) was really with the SAF who for some reason (of which I can think of many) was not implementing and not the weapon itself... and somehow he keeps droning on and on while evading the rather obvious truth... that for some curious reason, he sees the need to brand the SAR-21 as "not one of the worlds best yet" for whatever bizzare reason that is quite irrelevant to the normal grunts that use the weapon, love it, and know it works very well indeed.<br><br>It would behoove you not to follow his path.<br><br>Nuff said.<br><br></strong></blockquote></div>

Unit culture may be a mitigating factor but no more. If my rifle was found covered with rust, I would expect to be shafted for it; I would not expect to get off by saying that my OC/PC/Sgts have never ever checked or told us to clean my rifle.<br><br>The blame game is also crucial - too often the term has been used to sweep aside issues. Blame, or rather responsiblity, needs to be allocated so that we can identify where the problem is. Finding out the various spheres of responsibility, identifying the irresponsible and punishing those found to be lacking  is part of the process of improving and preempting similar incidents.<br><br>After all rules and directives are useless without a big stick to enforce them. Hence they must be enforced and be seen to be enforced.<br><br></div>

She just happened to mention to the media that her weapon was jammed with sand during the fight and she never got off a single shot. That is if the media can be trusted to quote her in context...<br><br>The fact she even dared to mention this to the media shows somewhat that in her mind weapon discipline was always the furthest thing from her mind. Any grunt who knows his stuff would certainly refrain from putting in this detail when giving his/her account to the media for they know it reflects badly on them. Unless of course they were never taught the importance of keeping your weapon working at all in the field of ops... and their main concern was getting their stuff from point A to B without watching out for ambushes or getting lost.<br><br>Also we are ASSUMING, for the sake of an argument that she does not keep her weapon clean. It may very well be so that she does keep her weapon well cleaned, but simply happened to be unlucky at the wrong moment, and mentioned this suck-thumb fact to the media and left it to us to draw all the wrong pictures. Even combat units who keep their stuff in tip top condition as and when they can report fouling with dust and sand happening- in <span style="font-style: italic;">Generation Kill</span>, the recon marines were forced to fight with fouled Mk 19s simply because a logistical screwup prevented them from getting the proper lube for their weapon. If this is the case we have argued mostly for nothing.<br><br>In the end what we do know for sure, the facts we can really deduce is that there was something seriously wrong with Jessica Lynch's unit. They reacted in all the wrong ways to the ambush, got lost, and did all most of the things soldiers weren't supposed to do. All things considered the only conclusion I can draw up is that from the start they were screwed and poorly prepared for the war... if Jessica Lynch's weapon really jammed because she didn't take good care of it... unit quality would certainly be a main contributing factor. This not to say that grunts do not have individual responsibility... but often they are only as good as their commanders. If their commanders do not train and create an outfit that in which they can be proper soldiers... it's hard to blame the individual enlisted soldier even if they were on some level responsible for their own demise.<br><br>If one put her in a proper outfit, could we argue that she would have been drilled and trained to do far better? We may never know but I don't think there's any reason to automatically suggest that she must be a total incompetent just because the media saw it fit to paint her at first as G.I. Jane... A mistruth in the other direction is still a mistruth.<br><br>As for the post on the SAR... it's a cautionary tale of an impending pitfall in logic to avoid.<br><br></div>
