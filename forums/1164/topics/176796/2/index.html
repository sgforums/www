If killing the enemy troops aids in that, then so be it.<br><br>What do you gain by emptying every single round against the enemy, but u know that they will just overwhelm you anyway?

No men will respect a leader who shout orders from afar without being at the forth front with his men.<br><br>Any officers holding field appointment know that he has to be in the forth front not only to be aware of the ground situation and terrain but also to set the fighting tempo, to rally morale or to lead his fellow men. Yet, he has to be cautious that he himself should not get engross in a fire-fight when contacted because his immediate task to follow, should be to coordinate the movement/deploy of his troops in such a way as to utilise their firepower upfront, preventing fratricide in the event of flanking, look out for strategic spots or to relay information back to HQ. Only then can he hope to achieve mission success for the benefits of the bigger picture. Beside, all soldiers are equip with a standard rifle each as primary weapon which is mandatary to carry with them into battle as per SOP and the pistol is only secondary. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_neutral.gif" alt="Neutral" title="Neutral"></div>

Your OCS PC must be kidding you.<br><br>I believe it is lawful to shoot a soldier if he deserts in the heat of battle and disobeys orders to stop running away.

            <div class='col-md body'>Well, believe that it would not be wrong if the officer shoots a trooper who demoralises the morale of the troops and ask them to join him in deserting. That would be utterly coward. But that is not to say, we follow what the Russians did at Stalingrad, asking the men to charge and gunning down those who retreat.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>u cannot just shoot a soldier for desertion.  Its not allowed, by military law.<br><br>It is however, possible to sentence a soldier to death for misconduct in action.<br><br>However, that would require a field court marshal.<br><br>And unless the verdict in the court marshal is unanimous, the soldier cannot be sentenced to death. The presiding officer must be a captain and above if i am not wrong.  So not any tom dick or harry pc can happy happy shoot a soldier.</div>
