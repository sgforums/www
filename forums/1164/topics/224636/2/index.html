Actually, the LTTE doesnt really fit into the traditional image of a terrorist organization. To me, a terrorist organization are people that have to hide to carry their activites. A people that cannot openly stand up against government forces. But the LTTE seems to be doing a pretty good job against the Sri Lankans. When was the last time you actually saw a terrorist organization actually conquering and governing territory. To my limited extent of knowledge, I don't think I've ever seen it happening else where. It might not be entirely correct to classify the LTTE as a terrorist organisation. More like a secessionist movement. </div></blockquote>I agree with ur points. I guess the main difference btwn LTTE and the rest of the labelled terrorist organisations is that they do govern the land they have captured.<br><br>OT abit to define what is a terrorist group?<br><br>Lets compare LTTE to the Palestinians.<br><br>Motive and goal for LTTE: Originally fighting for a seperate state.<br><br>after 2002 decided to fight for self-government since the Sri Lankan Sinhalese govt refuses.<br><br>Situation: Sri Lankan government presses on with nationalism of sinhalese while neglecting tamils. Hence LTTE was formed (long story short)<br><br>Tamils negotiate with government. Fails. LTTE formed and violence erupts. Captures territories and governs them.<br><br>Motive &amp; Goal for palestinians: Fighting for their homeland and a palestinian state<br><br>Ever since the formation of the Jewish state, violence ensues till this very day with rocket attacks on Jewis settlements and in turn gets bombarded by israeli helicopters and fighter jets. Angered by the creation of that very state, militant groups are formed to resist Israel and to get back what they were supposed to have (can be disputed, but historically they  had a state)<br><br>Peace between Palestinians and Israel is shaky until today especially after Hamas got into power.<br><br>If you are them, do you think its fair for your government to labelled terrorists?<br>What constitutes to being a terrorist?

No law was there to punish the British officers who violated human rights at will in the most brutal form. The freedom fighters who was marching were beaten up and shot at will.

Disregarding all opposition the British divided bengal, then they supported the Muslim league a fundamentalistic organistation. Later when its leaders asked for a seperate nation in the name of religion, it was supported by the British and before leaving India, India was divided into Republic of India and Islamic Republic of Pakistan which comprises of west and east Pakistan. Republic of India continued with the tradition and remained as a secular, democratic, pluralistic nation which today is popularly known as India. The newly created Pakistan choose to be Islamic as it is the main basis of forming Pakistan. Large scale of Hindus and Sikhs moved into India whereas muslims wishing to live in an Islamic nation moved into Pakistan. Communal violence erupted and many people lost their lives. Later in 1971, after genocide and a freedom struggle East Pakistan became an independent nation of Bangladesh for the Bangladeshis.</div>
