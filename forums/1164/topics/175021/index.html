The accuracy of the weapon is constant. There is no such thing as zeroing to increase the inherent accuracy of the weapon.<br><br>(remember someone on this forum once said that their warrant officer declared that he had zeroed his weapon so thoroughly, he was aiming to place all his rounds through one single hole)</div>

Accuracy of a weapon refers to how consistently the round behaves after it leaves the barrel. So If i fire, and the round hits above the target, in a perfectly accurate weapon, if i aim at the same point and all else being equal, the round will hit at the same place.<br><br>eg. At 100m<br><br>I expect an M16 to be very accurate. If I aim at the chest of fig 11, and the round hits the head, then because the M16 is accurate, I know that if i aim at the chest again, the round will hit the head.<br><br>A revolver on the other hand is not as accurate as a rifle. At 100+m if i aim at the same point, I can expect there to be a variation as to where the round falls due. If i aim at the chest, at the round hits the leg, the next time round i fire may hit the ground, etc.<br><br>Zeroing is so that the round will fall where you aim at. It has nothing to do with the accuracy of the weapon. Maybe we can say that zeroing improves the accuracy of the firer since he does not have to offset his aim point. It improves his accuracy because he does not have to estimate where to aim. Rear sight, front sight, Boom! No need to aim left, or up or down. His inherent marksmenship ability is not improved simply because he has zeroed his weapon.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>OK. So it is universally accepted by everyone here that when zeroing a weapon - an M16 for example - you are actually tuning the sights to YOUR individual eyesight.<br><br>Right?<br><br>So this means if I pick up my mate's M-16, I'd probably shoot bobo.<br><br>Which brings me to the next question:<br><br>What about this SAR-21 being "factory-zeroed"?

            <div class='col-md body'>Don't let the default factory of the sar-21 fool u. Still must adopt proper firing posture for the weapon in order to use it accurately.  Trying shoot the Sar-21 like how u shoot ur m-16 won't give u a good hit rate either. =D<br><br>I'm currently doing archery now, and i have to zero my bow every week. Same thing applies.  Zeroing by right would allow every round to land on the same spot IF you release perfectly.  For a rifle, a sturdy grip, + applied breathingt technique, posture, and trigger squeeze, if identical at every squeeze, will result in VERY tight groupings, if not the shots landing one on top the other.<br><br>Of course, nobody is perfect, hence the shots will always seperate.</div>

            </div>
            <div class='col-md body'>Actually, that IS an interesting question that tvdog raised.<br><br>Theoretically speaking, the objective of zeroing is to set the intercept of two lines at the intended point of impact.  The first of these lines is the trajectory of the projectile.  The second line traces the path from the targetted spot to the tip of the foresight to the centre of the rear sight to the shooter's eye.<br><br>It would make sense that for iron sights, since the layout and size of the face varies from person to person (in particular the distance between the cheek and the eye), zeroing is an individual thing, and the foresight height has to accommodate for how high the shooter's eye sits, and the rearsight for the amount of tilt of the shooter's head, in order for the second line to be adjusted correctly.<br><br>Now how that gels with something like a SAR-21's scope is a different matter altogether - regardless of what angle you take to look through the sight, the crosshairs shoudl still stay on the same spot, and only the field of view should be affected by not looking directly through the sight.  Once the sight is zeroed, would the crosshairs then not point at the right spot regardless of who is looking through it?  Any differences in accuracy should be caused by the shooter's manner of handling the weapon.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Agreed, SG, weapon handling and the state of the weapon itself affect accuracy, although I'd treat zeroing and grouping as two separate issues.  If the grouping is fine and the zeroing is off, a competent shooter should be able to offset the aim and hit the target with some degree of reliability.  On the other hand, if the grouping is off, the weapon cannot be zeroed effectively.</div>

I have come accross people who cannot shoot the Fig. 11 target at 25m even if their lives depended on it!<br><br>Also agree that non-rifle match rounds, inconsistency seldom allow 2-3 cm at 100m (I assume you meant 100m bcos I have seen 4.5cm at 100m and 1.2cm at 25m, no kidding).<br><br>BTW zeoring is to align the bullet trag to your line of sight. It differs because of (i) the amount of muscle/fat on your cheek, (ii) how far you hold the rear sight from your eye, (iii) how you 'sit' the rifle butt into the hollow of your shoulder, (iv) how your squeeze/snap the trigger, and/or (iv) whether you hold your breath completely, half or not at all (recommended 1/3 breath out). Each and everyone has a different series of combinations of the above.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>All I want to say is that if a person before you zeroed the weapon and the 2nd person is to fire it, the round should land in the position as the first person have zeroed it.. that is if the the 2nd shooter adjust his natural position to align the front and rear apperture correctly..<br><br>By accuracy of the weapon.. I do not know the experts or professional's definition.. I mean that when a weapon is zeroed today, after it goes back to the armskote... 2 months later they might be a little off...<br>Additionally, each weapon is a little different from the next..<br><br>I did not mean that they will go through a single hole when fired...</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Thought I'd chime in here for a few brief comments.<br><br>If the rifle is "zeroed" through the iron sights using a particular sight picture, then that rifle should shoot to the same POI with subsequent users <span style="font-style: italic;">if they adopt the same sight picture that was used to zero the rifle</span>. The iron sights and barrel are attached to the upper receiver and are fixed in relation to each other, so it does not matter how the shooter's head is situated with respect to the rifle, as long the dominant (aiming) eye is in the correct position to acquire the same sight picture each and every time.<br><br>In practice, however, not everyone might use the same sight picture. For example, one shooter might prefer to have the entire bullseye sit atop the front sight post, while another might prefer that the top of the front sight post horizontally bisect the exact center of the bullseye. When zeroing a firearm, the shooter's preferred sight picture has to be accommodated.<br><br>Other factors that might work against achieving a repeatable zero in a particular firearm might include:<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Variances in the ammunition.</span> Manufacturing variances in the mass production of ammunition (coupled with the occasional lapse in quality control) might result in inconsistent powder charges, projectile weights and seating depths. The resulting variations in muzzle velocity would cause the POI to wander from the POA. Granted, the 5.56mm cartridge is a very flat-shooting round, and differences in muzzle velocity might not change the POI significantly at 100 yards, but at 200 yards and beyond, the changes in POI do become noticeable.<br><br>Military-issue and military-surplus ammunition aren't exactly known for holding tight manufacturing tolerances. I've measured variances of up to 400 fps with milsurp M193 (55 gr.) ammunition (and slightly less with M855 [62 gr.] rounds) out of the barrel of the same AR. That's why AR shooters who want to achieve a repeatable zero to maximize accuracy, handload their own ammunition.<br><br><img src="http://i12.photobucket.com/albums/a221/screwthepap/223_Reload.jpg"><br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Weather conditions.</span> Wind, temperature and humidity do, to varying degrees, affect the ballistics of the projectile. A gusty crosswind would wreak havoc with your POI, especially at extended shooting distances. An explanation of how temperature and humidity affect ballistics can be found <a href="http://www.exteriorballistics.com/ebexplained/4th/51.cfm" rel="nofollow">here</a>.<br><br>Fortunately (or unfortunately, depending on your point of view), it's always hot and humid in Singapore, so the effects of temperature and humidity can almost be regarded as a constant.   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br><br>MG</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>in theory the tip and aperture of front and rear sights are centre and along an axis parallel to the line of sight sticking to the theory of a perfect line of travel of a bullet fired from the rifle. no zeroing is needed in such a theory. however there are many physical aspects that is present to thwart this theory since the rifle shall be used in a planet with gravitational pull, various environmental change aspects and in the hands of a human being and not robots.<br><br>Thus i personality feel that zeroing is more a task to check the centre position of the sights..sometimes some rifle zeroings are clicked to such an award position that immediately u know there must be something wrong with the shooter or the rifle itself. in Sg's infantry unit the M-16 was our main rifle and has a standard specificaition and accuray rating based on the perfect line of sight theory so say at 300m range if the firer adopt the basic firing fundamentals and with some fine tuning of the rifle sights condition through zeroing the rounds (if also at a constant loading) should find its mark on a large stationary target board.<br><br>The newer SAR21 has a scope with cross hair sights so require minimum or no zeroing at all..u just have to get to know the positions of your sights when aiming at a target from a greater distance, judging the weather/ wind condition since the velocity of the projectile gets lower as it travels away to the limit of its effective range, going downwards to the ground level or swept left or right against the direction off wind travel etc.<br><br><a href="http://www.huntingmag.com/guns_loads/zero_060205/" rel="nofollow">may want to read this</a><br><br></div>
