            <div class='col-md body'>Haha my fav IFV, anyway for light tank ours will most likely be based no e bionix chasis but it will most likely be another class rather then another version of e bionix as for air defence e SAM version of e M113 is very new unlikely 2 be replaced or else built them for wat <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_neutral.gif" alt="Neutral" title="Neutral"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>First ATGM version unlikely cos no demand for it yet at lest for now, then i feel a gd air defence system should combine gun n SAM like e wildcat turret with 2 30mm gun n 4 clip-on SAM like mistral,stinger or SA-18 or any 2 type of SAM its desiged 2 fitted on2 most IFV/AFV maybe we can use something like tat <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>What makes you think the M113 cannot keep up with the Bionix???<br>If the M113 used is the Ultra version, then there is absolutely no problem whatsoever. In any case, there is no need for an air defense vehicle to be directly in line with the Bionix. Their role will be to support from behind, at the rear echelon.<br><br>BTW, I have experienced the old M113 before back in NS, and believe me, in the hands of a "garang" driver, it can give you a hell of a ride!!!!!!<br>My M113 driver can even do drifting.... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by ^Delta^:</div><div class="quote_body">I hope to see an ATGW version with 4 Spike /NT-D launchers and reloads carried internally.

            <div class='col-md body'>Actually both steers the same way, just that the bx has both differentials linked to a steering wheel. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">  If you ever got to open a bx up and have a hacksaw in hand, you could ruin its steering just by sawing off that thin diameter of a differential link. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">  But most of us just choose to loosen the screws on that damn thing to give the driver a hard time keeping it straight. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>That will be ideal. The vehicle then can provide short range anti-air support to the armoured forces much like the new Igla M113. This can be used to defend airbases as well and thus replacing the RBS-70 on V200 and the immobile guns. Definitely worth some consideration due to its versatility.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"></div>

In any case, there is no need for an air defense vehicle to be directly in line with the Bionix.

            <div class='col-md body'>Prob with M113 is the stupid profile is too tall.  CG is dam high.  Bigger and more obvious target, as well as flip risk.<br><br>Btw, any idea if they plan to make a SCOUT version of the BX? IE, BX with signals intercept equipment, enhanced optics etc.</div>
