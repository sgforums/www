The OICW is really two guns in one package attached to a high tech targeting computer.  The bottom is a 5.56mm assault rifle, and the top fires 20mm HE assault cannon rounds.  The 5.56mm is great for anti-personel, while the 20mm HE is good for flushing enemy forces out of reinforced positions, or attacking light vehicles.  The targeting computer uses a sensors package that can pick up anything on the battlefield, even magically or technologically hidden items.  The targeting computer incorporates a range-finder and automatically adjusts the sights to compensate for wind and range.<br>The plans for the OICW to replace the modified M-16's didn't work out and eventually the M-16/M203 combination was left in the field.  When Colt replaced its aging M-16 fleet with the new M-23's, the M-22 was chosen to take the M-16/M203's spot, once again killing the idea of the OICW.  But with the advent of magic and Ruthenium Polymers, combined with better snipers the need for a system that could detect invisible and/or partially hidden objects became apparent.  Colt re-built the OICW to incorporate all of the latest technology to fill this role.  The UCAS Army now issues a few OICW's to each squad to act in the anti-sniper, anti-magic roles, for which this is superb.  UCAS forces also use the OICW in urban environments where the sensors are a great asset.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I heard its been cancelled.  They split the project and the assault rifle part and the grenade launcher part will be developed as separate projects.  The assault rifle portion is now the XM-8 (basically a Americanised Heckler &amp; Koch G36) and the grenade launcher portion is developed into a standalone launcher and increased calibre to 25mm (can't remember the new designation)</div>
