            <div class='col-md body'>It is rumoured that someone up north has bought over 3000 of these ATGMS from pakistan. These ATGM's are actually pakistan locally produced Chinese HJ-8 (Hong Jian) ATGMS.<br><br><a href="http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/world/china/hj-8.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/world/china/hj-8.htm</a> (summarised)<br><br>The PLA's second-generation anti-tank missile "Hongjian-8" [Red Arrow] was deployed in the late 1980s. This anti-tank missile has a long range and is accurate, dependable and powerful. It can pierce through armors 80mm thick. The front armor of the gun tower of Taiwan's best M60 tanks is only 110mm thick. The latest "Hongjian-8E" was finalized for production in the mid-1990. The "Hongjian-8E" has a range of four kilometers, and an estimated hit accuracy of over 90 percent. Since it is fitted with tandem warhead, it can pierce through tanks with reactive armor, and has an armor-piercing depth of over 100 millimeters. The "Hongjian-8E" can be carried by infantry soldiers or mounted on various types of vehicles and helicopters. The performance of the "Hongjian-8E" is similar to the "TOW" anti-tank missiles of the US army, and is better than the German and French "Milan" anti-tank missile.<br><br>In July 1997 Pakistan successfully tested two missile systems -- Anza and Baktar Shikan, which will add to its conventional military strength. Baktar Shikan is a second generation anti-tank guided missile weapon system which pursues the principle of optical aiming, IR tracking and automatically generated, remote controlled and wire transmitted guidance signals. The system can quickly be dis-assembled into the following four sub-units, each not weighing more than 25 Kgs, thus making the system man-portable:<br><br>Encased missile<br>IR Goniometer<br>Guidance unit<br>Tripod assembly<br><br>Aiming at the target through 12 magnifications sight of Goniometer, the firer presses the firing trigger and keeps the cross hairs of the sight on the target. The rest is done by the system itself, which automatically guides the missile to fly along the line of sight until it hits the target and a powerful warhead enables its destruction.<br><br><img src="http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/world/china/images/redarrow8-002.jpg"><br><img src="http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/world/china/images/baktar_shikan-atmws.jpg"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>JANEÂ’S DEFENCE WEEKLY - JULY 14, 2004<br><br>Malaysia accepts Pakistani ATGW<br>CHRISTOPHER F FOSS JDW Land Forces Editor<br>London<br><br>Malaysia has taken delivery of its Armoured Combat Vehicle (ACV) 300-series tracked armoured vehicles fitted with the Pakistani Baktar Shikan anti-tank guided weapon (ATGW).<br><br>A contract was placed in late 2000 with FNSS Savunma Sistemleri of Turkey for 211 ACV 300 vehicles in 10 configurations. The 300 in the vehicleÂ’s designation denotes the output of the Detroit Diesel 6V-53T diesel engine in horsepower. The vehicle is called Adnan in Malaysian service.<br><br>Final deliveries are due later this year and an additional order is expected to be placed in the future.<br><br>One of the variants ordered by Malaysia is the ATGW configuration armed with the Baktar Shikan launcher mounted on a pedestal that can be retracted into the hull of the vehicle under full armour protection when not required. The launcher can also be deployed away from the vehicle on its tripod.<br><br>The vehicle is also armed with a 7.62mm machine gun and 76mm electrically operated smoke grenade launchers.<br><br>The Baktar Shikan is manufactured by the Institute of Industrial Control Systems (previously the Dr A Q Khan Research Laboratories) and is a further development of the China North Industries Corporation (NORINCO) Red Arrow 8 ATGW. It is a wire-guided, command-to-line-of-sight system that only requires the operator to keep the sight locked onto the target to ensure a hit.<br><br>The original version had a maximum range of 3,000m and was fitted with a single high-explosive anti-tank (HEAT) warhead. More recently, a tandem HEAT warhead has been developed for this missile to engage targets fitted with explosive reactive armour.<br><br>NORINCO has also developed a 3,500m-range version as well as alternative warheads. However, it is not known whether these improvements have been incorporated into the Pakistani versions.<br><br>The Baktar Shikan ATGWs were supplied to Malaysia under a separate contract placed with Pakistan three years ago and also included in this deal were Anza Mk I fire-and-forget man-portable surface-to-air missiles.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I agree with four-niner to a certain extent. The Carl Gustav is bulky and heavy, further more Russian anti-tank weapons can be quite good too.

And since you have both AP, Smoke, Illum, Heat and bunker busting its a versatile weapon.</div>

The tests involved firing large amounts of ordnance (including several versions of RPG ATGL, light and heavy ATGMs, and APFSDS rounds) at frontal projections of T-80U and T-90 MBTs both protected with Kontakt-V ERA and stripped of it.<br><br>T-80U and T-90 MBTs were represented by 3 vehicles each, one with Kontakt-V ERA, one with removed explosive packages and one reserve vehicle. For the ERA part of trials, knocked-out ERA packages were replaced after each shot.<br><br>One more T-80U MBT was used for special trials that focused on testing of Shtora-1 EOCMDAS.<br><br>The following weapons were used:<br>* Infantry ATGLs (fired at a distance of 40m)<br>* RPG-7 (using advanced 105mm grenade PG-7VR with a tandem<br>warhead, pen. 650mm RHA)<br><br>* RPG-26 (disposable launcher, pen. &gt;500mm RHA)<br>* RPG-29 (advanced 105mm launcher, pen. 750mm RHA)<br>* ATGMs (fired at a distance of 600m)<br>* Malyutka-2 (pen. &gt;600mm RHA)<br>* Metis (pen. 460mm RHA)<br>* Konkurs (pen. 650mm RHA)<br>* Kornet (pen. &gt;850mm RHA)<br>* APFSDS (fired from T-80U MBT at a distance of 1,500m, the<br>most likely round is 3BM42)<br><br>Each weapon was fired 5 times at each target, for a total of 20 shots per weapon. The total number of shots fired during the trials thus exceeded 150.<br><br>The trials yielded the following outcome:<br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">ATGLs</span><br>T-90: RPG-29 produced a total of 3 penetrations.

Furthermore, after firing the crew entered the vehicle, activated it and was able to execute the firing sequence. Without ERA, one round penetrated.<br>T-80U (data available only for stripped target): One round almost penetrated (3mm hole in the inner lining, no visible equipment damage); two penetrated to 1/2 thickness; one missed the target completely; one hit the gun.<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">CONCLUSIONS</span><br>RPG-29 proved to be by far the most potent weapon among those used. As powerful as heavy ATGM Kornet, it appeared to assure the frontal penetration of T-80U even for the squad-level firepower. Even though T-90 fared better, it is still not immune to it. Considering sufficient proliferation of this weapon and the fact that this is still a fairly light infantry weapon, it is the most dangerous adversary of modern Russian MBTs, and is a very disturbing development.<br>Original reports that ATGM Kornet performance is severely degraded by ERA due to its peculiar order of internal components proved true as the ATGM with at least 100mm higher penetrating potential was not superior to a much lighter RPG-29.<br><br>Report of Shtora-1 EOCMDAS trials is confusing. Being laser-guided, ATGM Kornet should not suffer any interference from Shtora as it only affects IR SACLOS ATGMs. Furthermore, ATGMs can only deviate to the left if the marker is set to the left of both emitters, which is hardly likely. It is possible, however unlikely, that it was caused by a sloppy work of removal the warhead which e.g. could cause a gyro cofusion.<br><br><img src="http://armor.kiev.ua/fofanov/Tanks/TRIALS/T-80U.jpg"><br><img src="http://armor.kiev.ua/fofanov/Tanks/TRIALS/T-90.jpg"><br><br>see the big big holes marked in red on the T80 and T90, dun play play ah russian ATGW is good ah.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>The main problem for 84mm is the weight and the back blast. Due to the fact most units are using the MK 1 and2. the heavy weight means that the 84 team is usually veri slow then trekking, worst is they face difficulties catching up with others. This is veri disadvantageous to us as our infantry battalions are designed to be light type. The 84 is also not responsive enough. If the there is a surprise encounter, the 84 team may not be able to fire due to back blast.<br><br>Thus I believe we shoulder look into the current MATADOR design. It is 90mm in calibre thus it has potential to be a MAW. Perhaps we could get a tandem type for it, thus efectively could replace Carl gustav rifle. The existing matador is also a little too heavy. 9 kg is no mean joke......, just imagine leopard crawling with it. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_twisted.gif" alt="Twisted Evil" title="Twisted Evil">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_eek.gif" alt="Shocked" title="Shocked"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>See ... You talk about fire supporting for our troops when they trying to overtake objectives as if the enemy will be firing out in the open meh?<br><br>On those objectives there will be  a series of connecting trenches dug with thick thick overhead protection from airburst shrapnel. Then CG84 effective firing distance is only 700mters that means there are only very few places you can fire from like high knolls nearby that can offer good foilage free overhead view to do firesupport so you can be sure there will be someone waiting there for the CG84 team or maybe deploy a few sniper to wait there. Then how?<br><br>The good thing abt MBT in this region is that there are not many, PT-91 only got a few so that means they cannot afford to deploy so many around but then for major objectives you can be sure to find one or a few, if the whole batallion during MTC meets a T-80 or PT-91 does it have any weapon in the arsenal to take on these little buggers? Or everybody just drop everything and run away is it?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy">  At least with a few RPG-29 we no need to scare can still wallop them.<br><br>also some RPG rounds are thermobaric, with thermobaric firesupport is possible already and no matter how good your trench also cannot escape fuel explosive, fuel explosive when exploded becomes sticky like napalm goes into every nook and cranny burns everything shure die one.<br><br>CG84 old hunk of junk already ah even up north they are throwing it away to embrace the RPG we should be doing the same otherwise oneday we jialat ah.</div>
