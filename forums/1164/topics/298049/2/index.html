            <div class='col-md body'>I think it's safe to say, If the W.Allies didn't make it past the fortress wall, The Germans stood a chance to defeat or force a stalemate in Russia as Stalin has time and time urged the Allies to open another front in the Western which led to significant resource lost.<br><br>Another two scenario to consider. What if Hitler didn't declare war on US? What if the 3 army groups actually made it to Moscow before the 1942 winter<br><br>If Hitler didn't stupidly fall in Japan's plot, He could have actually forced the British to their knees. Because of Japan, Hitler lost the war, On accounts that they requested that as Ally, Germany should declare war on US AND a neutrality pact signed between the Japanese and Soviets allowed the Reds to direct men and resources to the endangered capital.<br><br>Of the 3 army groups in Russia, It came to about 4.5 million men, over 25,000 worth of artillery, planes and tanks. Had the advance on the Moscow defense line been swift considering that the only people holding the line were draftees, old men, women and even childrens. Imagine the amount of damage Germany could have made to the W.Allies on the western front?</div>

The West do not really thought of the Japanese as civilised and as their equal then.

Initially they believed that the Allies would attack France from Calaise but they instead landed in Normandy. During the invasion, Rommel and his senior officers were on leave hence reserve forces were hesitant to dispatch reinforcements from Calaise to Normandy in fear of a second Allied beachead.<br><br>And I dare say another turning point of the war was when Rommel was forced to commit suicide.</div>

Had Normandy not been a success, there would be 2,000 Tiger I and 1,500 Tiger II on the eastern front.<br><br>I don't care about how the Japanese fared but in the European theater, Germany had the upperhand believe it or not. Only the Russian IS-2 was capable of any chance of destroying the Tiger tanks even then, they had to go within 500m of it.<br><br>The W.Allies didn't have any tanks to counter even the Panther upfront, their Shermans were pretty much scrap metal in the later parts of war and the M26 weren't even deployed in large enough numbers to be effective.</div>

Then German High Command can rush all the Panzers to the Eastern Front. Add that to the 10:1 kill ratio for the average German panzer and the Soviets would probably get counter-attacked back to Ukraine or Russia proper.

Add that to the very favourable terrian which in the hands of a competent General would be able to turn each battle into a Iwo Jima (now called io tou) or Okinawa campaign but 10 times bloodier.<br><br>In their hands were also 1000+ suicide planes and countless suicide boats for downing invasion ships. Speaking of the IJN, they had a few heavily damaged ships, such as the ex-BB Nagato, where she was disengined and AA Guns removed to serve as a static gun platform.<br><br>Even though the Japanese has nearly lost, they were determined to give their all, and hardened their Home Defences.<br><br>Now going into hypotechical mode, if the Allies were rebuffed at Normandy, then consequently the Soviets wouldnt send troops back to their Far East and engage battle with the IJA in late 1945. If that didnt happen, Japan would have Manchuria's resources and the entire Kwantung Army at its disposal. That would mean another 200k men and 2000 planes more to fight.</div>
