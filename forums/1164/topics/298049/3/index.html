The Germans also remedied the weakness in side armour by adding side skirts and zimmerit coating on it.<br><br>The Tiger II might be the best tank, had it had more time in Research and Development. If only the engine problems were solved, the Tiger II would have been as fast as the Panther.

Nothing wrong with that.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>And to add on to my post, I am quite unsure how would the Americans react to an overwhelming Soviet victory over the Germans.  By 1944 Roosevelt was advocating the "Four Policemen Theory" and he did place high emphasis on cooperation with the Soviets on a common vision.  That together with his personal distain for France might have introduced a willing for the Soviets to head all the way west.  He did sound off many a times of his unwillingness to be preoccupied with post-war recuperation of Europe and would rather either the British or Soviets do it.<br><br>Stalin as usual was the realpolitik player, pocketing all territories the red army could cover as bargaining chips for a post-world negotiation with the west.  I sincerely doubt he would have stopped out of consideration!<br><br></div>
