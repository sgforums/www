            <div class='col-md body'>when u said D-day... i assumed u meant the invasion of Normandy...<br><br>actually "D-day" is just a generic term for an invasion.. there is also a D-day in the invasion of Iwo Jima, Okinawa, Tarawa etc etc..... and H-hour is the hour of the invasion.....<br><br>anyway, in the event that D-day failed, the allies will probably lose a lot of men and materials....<br><br>however, with the industrial might of the US, these will be replaced shortly....<br><br>Eisenhower actually prepared a "defeat" speech in the event the invasion failed... so there is an even chance that it will fail....<br><br>so we will probably see another Dunkrik as the Allies tried to extract the remmants of the invasion forces... with both air and naval superiority, i think the majority of the invasion forces can be extracted... probably the rear guard will become POWs....<br><br>there will probably be a polictical storm in US and UK, but those in powers will probably stay there....<br><br>Germany will probably be able to focus on the Eastern front and i don't think the USSR will be able to make significant in-roads also....<br><br>The Allies will continue to pound Germany from the Air... more airmen from the 8th AF and Bomber Command will lose their lives....<br><br>There is actually a seconodary operation,  the invasion of southern france, it will probably not be carried out....<br><br>The 2nd d-day will probably be delayed for another year or so.... and this time the allies will probably use overwhelming force....<br><br>Germany will be even weaker to resist...... esp when they are bled white by the russians...<br><br>the way in europe will probably end about a copule of months....not by a full year as i expect the 'drive across france' to take shorter time due to weakened resistance... there will probably 'not' be a battle of the bulge type of counter offensive...<br><br>the war in the pacific will not be affected by much.... we might even see a situation where japan surrender before germany....<br><br>Also if the allies use the atomic bomb on Japan, Germany might surrender also.... when they saw the effect of the atomic bomb.<br><br></div>

The Nazi war machine would still be eventually be crushed...by the Soviet Army alone.  The most is that WWII (for the Germans) would not end on May 8, 1945 but could be in 1946 or even in 1947.  The end result for the Germans is still certain, not the question of 'IF' but 'WHEN'.  Don't forget, the Soviet counter-assaults were already draining the German manpower considerably (heard what happened to the German Sixth Army at Stalingrad?).  If you read books here, it is stated that most of the German defenders at the Normandy beaches were not the finest nor the fittest troops (mostly fresh from the Hitler Youth Camps and the old Volksstraum) except the SS Panzer reserve that were positioned at the wronmg places due to deceptive communique that were sent out by the Brits to fool the Germans.<br><br>However I disagree on scenario 2, allowing the Soviet Army to 'liberate' Hungary, Poland, Romania and the smaller Eastern Europe is one thing, but to allow the Soviet Army to roll into France is not accepatable by the W.Allies.<br></div>
