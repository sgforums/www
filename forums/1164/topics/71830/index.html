            <div class='col-md body'>have u watched Gattacca? its a movie starring Ethan Hawke and Uma Thurman and it goes somewhere along the lines of what you're talking about...<br><br>and here's the theme for the whole movie: <strong>there is no gene for the human spirit.</strong><br><br>i'm probably genetically imperfect... childhood asthma, myopia, maybe premature baldness as well... average IQ, below average height and weight ratio...<br><br>does that make me inferior genetic material? i dare u to make that claim.<br><br>part of what makes the human race so special is genetic diversity. all that nonsense about breeding geniuses with athletes for genetically superior offsprings is pure nonsense... Einstein and Beethoven would probably have been aborted if u went by those silly standards.<br><br>eugenics is morally deplorable to me not merely because it blatantly discriminatory but because it seeks to reduce procreation to a set of fixed formulaes. its never that simple.<br><br>even if u attempt to fertilize a "class A" egg with a "commando quality" sperm, u will still have a chance of getting either a normal healthy fetus, a retard, or maybe... just maybe... a slim chance of an athletic genius. its not reduceable to that level... not yet anyway. and i shudder to think of the day when it will be possible...<br><br>besides, when u deliberately weed out certain genetic traits to make "superior" human beings, u might actually be leading to mankind's extinction.<br><br>Darwin, contrary to popular beliefs, isn't about eugenics. the "strong" survives doesn't mean physical strength. it means adaptability.<br><br>heard of sickle cell anaemia? don't wanna insult your intelligence... go check it out. a supposed "weakness" might actually turn out to be a winning trait that enables a specie to survive.<br><br>a friend of mine was thinking of getting an alsatian guard-dog recently and was told by a canine enthusiast we knew that alsatians make lousy guard-dogs these days cos pple are breeding "pure-bred" alsatians for looks... the signature ears, face, coat and tail... to the extent that they aren't very smart anymore...<br><br>and the whole point of getting thoroughbreds, for pple who know canines, is not just for looks, but because they're extremely intelligent and easy to train. now, because of vain, ignorant, pet owners, we have a specie suffering from genetic deterioration resulting from lack of diversity. ever wondered why golden retrievers are so friendly (or retarded) ?<br><br>go figure...<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Thankfully,since my cousin is a doctor,I do know what sickle cell anaemia is.and no,you did not insult my intelligence,I heard of it before.You dun need to get so winded up lah man.Chill.<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">What is sickle cell anaemia?</span><br>Sickle Cell Anaemia is an inherited blood disorder, which mainly affects people of Afro-Caribbean origin, and some people from the Mediterranean region, Arabia and Asia<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">What causes sickle cell anaemia</span>Within our blood vessels are red blood cells (which are shaped like doughnuts). These red blood cells contain a protein called haemoglobin (HbA). The function of haemoglobin is to carry oxygen from the lungs to all parts of our body.<br><br>Sickle Cell Anaemia occurs when the Hba is replaced by sickle haemoglobin. When you have sickle haemoglobin, your red blood cells become sickle-shaped, therefore, they cannot pass through very small blood vessels. This causes blockage, resulting in lack of oxygen to parts of the body which in turn results in pain, and/or damage to vital organs.<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">How does a person get sickle cell disease and anaemia?</span><br><br>Sickle Cell Anaemia is not 'catching'. We all have two copies of the gene for HbA, one inherited from our mother and one inherited from our father. Now, if one parent carries the HbS gene then sickle cell trait can occur in their baby. This means that the child is a carrier of the sickle cell gene, but has enough HbA to keep their red blood cells flexible. So the child will not have the symptoms of Sickle Cell Anaemia. Very occasionally they have to be careful when doing things that demand less oxygen than normal, for example scuba diving. If both parents carry the trait then the child may be born with the full Sickle Cell Disease with the symptoms as described below.<br><br>There are other types of haemoglobin such as HbC and beta thalassaemia, that when combined with sickle haemoglobin cause sickling disorders. Consequently, there are different forms of Sickle Cell Disorder, which occur in different ethnic groups.<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">The symptoms of sickle cell disease and anaemia:</span>Symptoms include fatigue, breathlessness, bone and joint pain, weakness and susceptibility to infections. People affected with Sickle Cell Anaemia also experience what's known as 'crisis'. These are severe attacks which can encompass the aforementioned symptoms as well as jaundice, fever and vomiting. A crisis usually leads to hospitalisation, and in some cases a blood transfusion is needed. Repeated crisis can lead to liver, lung, kidney damage and other medical conditions.<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Managing sickle cell disease and anaemia:</span><br>There is no cure for the disease but daily medication and regular hospital check-ups keep Sickle Cell Anaemia manageable. People with the condition are able to go to school, college or work but, of course, may have to take time off for periods of illness. Like with many other conditions, it's a matter of being aware of the 'limitations' of the disease and taking precautions. So, for instance, avoiding strenuous and emotional stress, drinking plenty of fluids to avoid dehydration and being able to recognise the onset of illness is important.<br><br>and there you have it.</div>
