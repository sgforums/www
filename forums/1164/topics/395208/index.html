              <p>that's the beauty of it............so that hi tech nations can still get hurt by weak ones..............</p>
              <p>problem is the powerful nations can use these ''simple'' weapons to stage false-flag attacks like 9/11 and then blame it on someone else before whacking them................US, UK and especially Israel are the masters of these kind of dirty tricks.</p>

              <p>you can be sure US and UK trops won't get killed if they all returned home..............to shift the blame of their killings from the real ones that are responsible, the Western media misled the public into thinking the muslims are the bad guys..........just because the powerful elite wants to control the muslims' oil and gas.........</p>
