              <div>
              <p style="margin: 0px 0px 1em; padding: 0px;">Missile performance aren't absolute numbers.  Airspeed / Altitude and aspect of the launching aircraft play a crucial role in improving those numbers.  </p>
              <p style="margin: 0px 0px 1em; padding: 0px;">I have doubts of that article's argument as I have trouble believing this statement : - </p>
              <p style="margin: 0px 0px 1em; padding: 0px;"><span style="color: #333333;"><em>With a thrust vectoring engine capability (TVC), the Flanker driver has the option of making himself into a very difficult endgame target for the AIM-120 regardless of  the capability of his jamming equipment. </em></span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0px 0px 1em; padding: 0px;">I never truly believed how TVC can be used to avoid missiles. TVC when activated slows the aircraft down significantly.  Slow targets are dead targets.  </p>
              <p style="margin: 0px 0px 1em; padding: 0px;">Also, if the current models of AIM-120s are in the air, his Jamming equipment will only serve as a bright beacon for the AIM-120 to home in on due to the "Home-On-Jam" capability. </p>
              <p style="margin: 0px 0px 1em; padding: 0px;">The author is also biased the way he set up his scenario, allowing the Flanker to shoot at longer ranges with the R-27s, assuming that the defending aircraft has no self-protection jammers, while allowing the Flanker to have "modern DRFM monopulse" jammers.  He might as well assume the target to be an unarmed Cessna 172. </p>
              <p style="margin: 0px 0px 1em; padding: 0px;">If the target aircraft is an F-16C and above, its jammers would have denied the Flanker it's R27 shot opportunity, forcing the Flanker to fly closer to burn through the jamming signal.  </p>
              <p style="margin: 0px 0px 1em; padding: 0px;">The single biggest flaw of his whole argument against the effectiveness would be the issue of combat record. The AMRAAM has shot down Flankers, Fulcrums and Foxbats alike in Iraq and Serbia with good accuracy and effectivness.  The reverse cannot be said about the R-27 (and all its SARH, IR, ARH and <span style="font-weight: bold;">whatever fart-sniffing variant</span>), and the R-77.  </p>
              <p style="margin: 0px 0px 1em; padding: 0px;">They cannot prove their effectivness by simply discrediting the AMRAAM's performance thus far.  They can only prove it by matching or out-performing it, and they have yet to do so. </p>
              <p style="margin: 0px 0px 1em; padding: 0px;"><br>True enough, Russian BVR is largely mass and saturation of multiple seeker types.  But thus far, none of their Missiles have proven to be effective in any measure.  However, AMRAAM allows its equipped air force to handle such "mass" problems as well by Grinding larger formations away with just a few flights of aircraft supporting.  And thats as far as I will go into tactical discussions of the AMRAAM. </p>

              <p>yeah, i did mention the report was slightly biased but its one of the few open source articles  that i can quote from unfortunately.</p>
              <p>anyway,  i do agree the AMRAAM is definitely more capable and has a proven track record. unfortunately the russians didn't export their weapons to customers good enough to score some positive results for them. the only customers that have the Su-30 type that might get some results, the world policeman doesn't wanna go into conflict with them yet. </p>
              <p>i was just trying to make a point that the combat effectiveness of the AMRAAM no doubt is good, but the hit probability of the missile decreases especially if you go up against BVR aware type of targets who possess similar type of missiles and self-protection. they might also emply similar weapon employment tactics, especially if they have also operate western aircraft, plus access to russian aircraft. maybe it s a rojak of everything for their tactics? might confuse them instead. </p>
              <p>in any case, just fire more to guarantee a hit lor. :P hahaha.</p>

              It is quite strange to find the suk held up to this pedestal when the F-15 has better radar, equal maneuvreability, better avionics, ECM, ECCM and better munitions. Not to mention numbers advantage, more pilot training, better digitalisation reducing workload, better service support etc.
              
              Even if the RSAF went totally missing, potential aggressors would find it difficult to match the SAF's capability on the ground. SAM coverage will be improved esp if the Spyder M-R is acquired, not to mention area coverage with the asters on the formidables and the Hawk upgrades. Russki strike capabilities with moving targets is a little short-sighted (which means close in encounters vs M-R sams).
              
              FMS reports suggests SG imported another XXXk 155mm shell cartridges + almost equal numbers of fuzes and propellants. ST eng has been pretty busy ever since it acquired CIS. At least SAF won't be worried about ground munition shortage in a shooting war.
              
              Mindef has been spending quite a fair bit of taxpayer $ and the results at least from my perspective has been justified so far.

              Nah, that's the purpose of having the AIM-9X and the HMS. Turn rates are important to get into acquisition envelope (and the closer, the more important). With the introduction of off-bore sighted WVR missiles, this has made higher turn rates less important (and not that the Su-30 has that significant a turn rate over the F-15). Watching Aim-9X doing a 180 deg turn on you-tube is amazing.
              
              Good pilots will always maximise the aircraft's advantage even against superior aircraft. RSAF exercises with the IAF really benefits the local pilots.
              
              Missile performance and counter measures in such instances are vitally important. Doesn't make sense if one can get 4 missiles off but zero-hits when the other party fires 2 and get a hit.

              <p>I wasn't referring to weapons vs manueverability.  I was simply stating that the F-15 is not superior in manueverability.  It has about a 5-6 degree per sec disadvantage.  </p>

With a thrust vectoring engine capability (TVC), the Flanker driver has the option of making himself into a very difficult endgame target for the AIM-120 regardless of  the capability of his jamming equipment. Since all of the AIM-120s fired are identical in kinematic performance and seeker jam resistance, any measure applied by the Flanker driver which is effective against one AIM-120 round in the salvo is apt to produce the same effect against all AIM-120 rounds</span></em></p>

              <p>Jamming resistance is greatly improved by using monopulse radar seeker. Monopulse radar seeker usually form several polarized beams at one pulse. Filters can be inserted to remove any signal that is either unpolarized, or polarized only in one direction. In order to confuse such a system, the jamming signal would have to duplicate the polarization of the signal as well as the timing, but since the aircraft with DRFM jammer receives only one lobe, determining the precise polarization of the signal is difficult. Especially the active radar seeker on AAM works only in terminal stage and the light up of the active seeker is pretty short in less than 1 min, in such a short time frame, the Assie funboy thinks the target plane’s RWR can locate the direction of the incoming AAM and then DRFM got enough dwell time to form exactly the same signal to jam the active radar seeker at a “50 percent degradation of AIM-120 kill probability?”  He must got the result after a wet dream instead of any serious job. The beauty of monopulse radar seeker is not only to be difficult to jam but also, in case of successful jamming , it can seamlessly switch to “Home on jam” mode, which means the jammer itself will provide illumination for the AAM to home in if its own signal being jammed.</p>

              Just wanted to clarify that most modern RF missiles have monopulse seekers. Even the R-77/27 and AIM-7 has it.
              
              The difference between active M-R AAMs such as the Amraam and earlier SARH is the necessity to illum the target. Targeting can be done in track while scan mode which reduces the warning time for the target aircraft until terminal homing of the missile. Factor in AESA (agile beam) and radar detection is even more difficult. For a mach 4 missile to be detected at 20km means 15 second reaction time as compared to 80km which provides a minute of reaction time. 15 seconds doesn't give much time to tackle home on jam functions.
              
              Think what happens when stealth aircraft is factored in.
              
              Also important is the onboard software. Miniaturisation of processors mean powerful onboard computers that can identify differing scenarios and take on continually upgraded programming algorithms to tackle such scenarios. In layman's term, its like a computer playing chess that has its programmers continually inputing more possible moves and identifying which are the best moves in certain scenarios. Faster processors = faster reaction times = use of better software.
              
              Shotgun, noted on the manoeuvre bit. Me didn't say F-15 had better m, I used "equal" which in the case of performance envelope is a fair statement to make.

              Also note ALQ-131(v) pods used for F-16 and F-15s. RSAF upgraded pods to block 2 standard in 1996-8. Additional updates every 2 years.

              I was not able to confirm that SG is license manufacturing this in SG from a public source and hence posted the correction. Although the following countries are noted to have licensed copies eg Brazil, Chile, Israel, Portugal, Romania, South Africa, Spain, and Sweden but I couldn't confirm this for Singapore via public source.
              
              Unless someone can post a valid public source, I'd prefer to regard this as a "no" or at most a "?" but that's not to say I'm right or wrong.
