              Before the F-35 enters service in RSAF, the F-15SG will take on the A2A role. Its only a short transition to the F-35 (5-7 years). 1-2 squadrons of F-35s is sufficient for A2A. Possibly 1/2 to 1 sqn of F-35B STOVL version will provide an adequate deterrent to potential surprise attacks. 
              
              The F-16 are also capable of stand-off munitions eg Mavericks, glided JDAMs. Once GBU-39A/Bs SDBs and BRU-61 multiple racks get configured onto the F-16s, the RSAF doesn't actually need that many aircraft to fulfil the same amount of missions it could currently fulfil.
              
              What RSAF could do with are more munitions though.... If RSAF can extend its underground depots to house munitions (including those owned by US), SG can buy munitions from US in times of need without needing to have it delivered all the way from US (and yet save on the ownership cost) ie we provide weapons depot services in Singapore as well..... Its a shared services JIT concept pulling from a same supplier. At the same time, the US doesn't need to ship its munitions to its frontlines all the way from US.

              <p>given the fog of war and the uncertainty that comes with it + the ever present murphy's law. you never know. maybe the adversary keeps his wild cards secret and we too, and then when we show hand. it's the same, oops. then if technological advantages are on parity then it'll be attrition based already? then it comes down to who has more of what. haha.</p>
              <p>it'll be ugly man... hehe</p>

              <p>F15SG and our D+/52 is well-optimised for deepstrike. otherwise why the need for conformal tanks?? the amount of drag though negligible still comes out significant if you ever need to do dogfighting, very very very very draggy!</p>

              <p>btw there's a certain video circulating around the internet, not sure if it's pulled down yet. its about a USAF F15 pilot debriefing some senior guys aobut the Su30MKI observed performances during Red Flag.</p>
              <p>gist of it is that no matter how good your aircraft is, at the hands of inexperienced pilots who can't utilised it to its max potential, even older legacy fighters can still win. and that the su-30 piloted by an experienced guy would be a tough nut to crack.</p>
              <p>quite an interesting insight.</p>

              <p>Yeah, the D+ is not really for dogfighting though it can hold its own when its Cat I.  Have to admit, having CFTs in a dogfight is a scary thought knowing that any gunshots are likely to come from that aspect. </p>
              <p>The video was rather enlighening about the TVC.  Green and over-eager pilots throwing the TVC around just to get nose authority for the quick kill when their sustained turn rate would have won out eventually anyway... sounds VERY green.  But I won't expect any Su-30s to get into a dogfight anyway.  </p>

              btw, CFTs are removable. Just a bit more troublesome. CFTs are very useful for minimising tanker missions for long range ferry missions to and from US.

              <p>The F-16 are also capable of stand-off munitions eg Mavericks, glided JDAMs. Once <span>GBU</span>-39A/Bs SDBs and <span>BRU</span>-61 multiple racks get configured onto the F-16s, the <span>RSAF</span> doesn’t actually need that many aircraft to fulfil the same amount of missions it could currently fulfil.</p>
              <p>What <span>RSAF</span> could do with are more munitions though…. If <span>RSAF</span> can extend its underground depots to house munitions (including those owned by US), SG can buy munitions from US in times of need without needing to have it delivered all the way from US (and yet save on the ownership cost) ie we provide weapons depot services in Singapore as well….. Its a shared services <span>JIT</span> concept pulling from a same supplier. At the same time, the US doesn’t need to ship its munitions to its frontlines all the way from US.</p>

              <p>in my opinion i think there is a minimum number of aircraft that any airforce should possess in order to wage an air campaign effectively. look at the US for example, they are currently being stretched very very thinly. and looking at future procurement 183 F-22s as their main bet for air superiority worldwide isn't enough.</p>
              <p>looking inwards towards our region or for most countries, unless you need force projection then probably the requirement for self-defence would mean that the numbers of aircraft or assets needed could be scaled down.</p>
              <p>but look at it this way, in any engagement you would expect losses. so let's say you load up an F16 or even a F35 with its full load of air-to-ground weapons. maybe you're expecting say 6 or more SDBs for example for a minimum of 1 bomb per target. if that aircraft gets shot down unfortunately then how? the other aircraft on that mission might have targets of its own to hit so you're already like 6 target kills less.  its like loading all your eggs in 1 basket. i think its more prudent to spread out the loads over slightly more aircraft so that loss of aircraft in an engagement would not render your mission ineffective?</p>
              <p>if you look at the US, when they go on a typical mission its like 4 aircraft tasked for Sweep, maybe 4 or 8 aircraft for strike, another 2 for SEAD, 2 more for rear sweep or escort.. thats already about 12 to 16 aircraft just for one mission to guarantee enough bombs to hit the target and usually you're looking at several targets within the vicinity, real case scenario would prob be more. of course we're only talking about legacy fighters like F15s, 16s and 18s and the rest of the conventional type of aircraft we have. F35s would be a significant asset to any airforce but you do still require a significant amount of them as their inner payload isn't that great, and if you want to add pylons outside to carry more then it defeats the whole purpose of them being stealth. :S</p>
              <p>just my 2c worth :P the more aircraft the better!! haha</p>
