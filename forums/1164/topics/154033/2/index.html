            <div class='col-md body'>Combination is not practical.<br>Submarines main advantage is stealth. It moves silent.<br><br>The bigger your submarine, the more moving parts it has, the more drag it makes in the water... all this leads to more noise and less stealth.<br><br>Also submarines are most vulnerable on the surface.<br>To submerge you have to get your pumps working and dive. You can't just turn the ship 90 degrees and shoot down, you have to do it at an angle.<br>Water resistance will also slow it's entry so bigger will be slower.<br>Can you imagine how long your carrier sub will take to dive?<br><br>Even if it's half the length of a normal carrier, it'll still take much longer to dive than a normal sub and probably make twice as much noise in the process.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>First of all, the cost of your all-in-one submarine carrier will be very very expensive, at least 5x to 10x the cost for a conventional carrier. After that, you will need delicated machinery and infrastructure to maintain your super carrier. You must understand that this is not easy like what u watch in cartoon series e.g. Macross.<br><br>After that, do bear in mind that your super carrier will be a damn big targets for enemy to shoot at. Even simple depth charge will not miss the target. W/o any shielding tech, your big carrier is just a exhibit in the harbour.<br><br>In addition, you sub carrier would have problem to access some of the region in the world. Deep open water ok, but not small, shallow, narrow straits. In addition, the maintenance work required is tremendous. Your Nuclear engine to power this big sub will be like a underwater rock band, and you lost your stealth advantages.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I rather that we spend the $$$ to colonize moon or put some extra eyes in the orbit to do some useful neighbourhood watch at our backyard. If one day Sg can hike a ride to moon, we can at least have some claim on the real estate on Moon for some real future development.<br><br>With Singapore focus on bio-techonlogy and moving up the semicon value chain, it is inevitable that some day in the future Sg would need some sort of low G facility for manufacturing some high grade medicine or precious semiconductors materials. It is towards our nation interest to kick start some real cutting edge material research, which can really propel our Sg into the top indusrtial leauge. Currently, we know that China and India is still very backward in material research. Jap and Korea are working on advanced engineering materials for bio and semicon.<br><br>Sg should really bank in on the weakness of China and India now. Both giants are still busy get the IT and Electonic assembly outsourcing contracts. It is a good move that Sg is starting to build wind tunnels and electronic magnetic labs, but we need more projects to spreadhead into advance material engineering. In this way, Sg can play a more important role in the emerging Bio-Semiconductor implant market.</div>
