As to the definition of ranger, a downgraded ex-SOF officer who told us frankly, they may have participated but not necessary completed the course but still given the patch even though dropped out. True rangers in singapore having really gone thru the course in US ony a small handfull. The course can really drive you insane!!<br></div>
