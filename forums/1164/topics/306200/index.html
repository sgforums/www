              <p>It is good to be confident but to be over confident and complacent is another matter altogether.</p>
              <p>Please take note that the Malaysian Army is much more battle-hardened due to their tougher training and less than ideal conditions as compared to our SAF which is increasing dependent on technology which in my opinion may not be a very wise move. War cannot be won just with technology alone, the people behind the machines count as well.</p>

              <p>I don't really get the point of all these pointless posturing on the part of the forumners. This consolidation is a very smart move by the Malaysians, IMHO. By consolidating the 5 TA battalions, they increase their connections to the country and not to the various states that the battalions come from. It may be part of a move to generate 5 additional first line motorised infantry battalions from 5 second line infantry battalions. This will definitely improve their urban combat abilities, unlike us, who will have to convert infantry to motorised infantry in order to increase our urban combat abilities.  Just goes to show how limited our manpower is against them.</p>
              <p>Again, these are <strong>motorised</strong> battalions i.e. to be used in the urbanised Malaysian peninsula rather than East Malaysia.</p>

            <div class='col-md body'><p>these 300 series TA were actually full time soldiers, not ur average weekend boy scouts.  unlike SG's full time reservists, they're full time through life.  LOL.  redesignating them as full time soldiers (hence the need to re-name) brings about many benefits to them like training, equipment, pension etc.  of late, they have been participating in bigger exercise manouvres.  perhaps for a more flexible role than merely guarding the malaysia-thai border.</p></div>

Besides, the Infantry is one of the cheapest forces to upgrade, even compared to other formations in the Army, so this move is actually very very smart by them. The fact that they are doing this so soon after we announced our acquisition of the Terrex is even more worrying.</p></div>

              <p>I wouldn't bother about the Border Regiment, my fellow Singaporean Neighbours. They are there purely for one region and one region only, the one bordering Thailand, in the separatist stricken Pattani province.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Eastern Malaysia is larger than the peninsula put together, which in the future would see an increase in RM Police GOF personnel mainly to deal with terrorism, cross border mafias, and kretek smuggling.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>But I am impressed. We Malaysians don't pay attention to the minute details of the SAF.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>And lastly, I don't think 60 ton tanks can do well in Malaysian terrain, what with the fuel costs, etc. You Singaporeans got your F15s yet??</p>

              <p>Sheer weight is not the thing to look into when you want to consider mobility, ground pressure is.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Last I checked, erm, the Leo2 actually has better ground pressure compared to the PT-91 that the MAF uses. What this means is that in difficult terrain the Leo2 actually performs better then the PT-91 despite being heavier.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>This condition is not unusual, it was observed in WW2 when the Pershing Medium Tank could handle terrain that the Sherman tank could not, despite being much heavier. Get a 80kg soldier in boots and a 45kg woman in heels to walk in mud, no surprises for who gets bogged down first. </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>So the question I think reflected back is... with it's high ground pressure and limited gun elevation, can the PT-91 do well in the undulating, and (if going by your logic) soft terrain of Malaysia?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Not bashing the PT-91, but I think the logic behind your one-liners ought to apply to your own things as well to see if they are really valid... if you don't think the Leo2 can do well in Malaysian terrain then you probably have far less reason to believe the MAF really made any sort of a smart idea buying a tank with higher ground pressure and limited gun elevation (vastly limiting the terrain that the tank can properly engage targets from).</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>So I'm not entirely sure what you are getting at with your one-liners... except demostrate general ignorance? </p>

              <p>Actually I believe those look more like cases of bad driving then actually getting bogged down <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Cartoon/teeth.png" alt="teeth.png"> and you know no matter how advanced the tank its no match for a bad driver who does not know his terrain.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The point is general mud is bad for ALL mobility in general... but the PT-91 is certainly going to fare worse in bad terrain then the Leo2, and that is just the plain truth and no my-country-better-then-your-country hot air. The only advantages the PT-91 really has is prehaps it might be able to use bridges that just marginally not be able to support the Leo2, but when you're looking at MBTs in general... most flimsy bridges are not going to take them anyway.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>BTW in that terrain those Abrams drivers drove into I doubt anything short of a ground-effect craft can go over... I mean the tank pratically drove into a ditch! <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Cartoon/teeth.png" alt="teeth.png"></p>

              <p>but the mini part i dont understand, can one compare the weight of a Mini Cooper with Leo or Twardy? more over the tank were use for combat, which means it has to search the enemy anywhere everywhere. Ofcourse no one drove a tank into a swamp, but can a 60 tonne tank traverse through a soft soil such as palm oil plantation?</p>

              <p>look at the last picture ST. The ground on the road side collapse, ive seen enough crappy road in M that will collapse when a 6 tonne truck run over it.</p>

              <p>The last picture maybe... but the other two? Looks like some bad driving involved... esp the first pic!</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Not that uncommon thou... on youtube there is a video of rather amusing Abrams driving accidents where you see the tank in funny positions that it shouldn't be in. But when you drive a 60 ton steel beast with limited visibility from your driver's position... Murphy's law will get you sooner or later.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>AFAIK, getting bogged down is very common in armoured warfare, and it does not happen just to MBTs. As it stands if you are talking about just plain muddy ground then you're probably better off in tracks then wheels.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Ultimately there are just some places that nothing can go, and it boils down to how you play your cards. In any case the case in point in, whatever affects the SAF will affect the MAF as well, more or less to the same degree. The MAF will not magically be more mobile or anything (thou it can be argued they will know the ground better). And of course by any measure their armour in terms of MBTs actually has LESS mobility over different conditions due to higher ground pressure.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Not sure if the soil in plantations are really soft... cos all the time i trained there it was one of the hardest parts to dig thanks to the root structure from all the plants. The only soft part is the peat layer on top... in fact plantations should be the most solid ground but trying to turn your turret in there will be a problem... heh... but then again it affects both sides.</p>

              <p>Hi ST, its actuially my fault. the last pic is actually the first. My bad. it is a series of picture showing the ground collapse and the abrams sinking intu the swamp becoz of its sheer weight.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>ladang getah i think got very hard soil, but the oil palm plantation have this soft soil....ala what do you call it? its a combination of dead leaf, dead animal, dead trees...very nasty when burn becos you cant see the fire.</p>

              <p>aiyah...driver`s instinct and knowledge of the vehicle lah.  You drive it. You`ll know where it can go and cannot go. You dont drive vehicle meh? if not, go get licence. i triple confirm you if you treasure/love your car or the money you use to buy your car, there are some places confirm you dont want to try driving through. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="icon_biggrin.gif"></p>

              <p>No. You want to drive your tank into a longkang to see if got anyone hiding there? Various kinds of systems have thier uses, strengths and limitations.</p>

              <p>but in a Mini you know you will only want to drove it on the tarmac. But a tank can go off road silly, and from inside the tank how to know the ground pressure?</p>

              <p>Ya you want to drive a tank into the sea? Can also drive into longkang ? Can go off road and you dun know ground pressure as you say what. Use your common sense(debatable here as to what is common lol) la. If it can be helped, you will certainly not drive a tank and risk scuttling(pardon the term) it. You will choose an alternative route. There are other platforms/methods you can use to traverse through the areas a tank cant. That is why you have a range of equipment and vehicles silly. I agree that some things are less obvious for tanks and tankees though. But like I`ve said, it cant be helped. There are many places for tanks to wander about. Dont worry. So they will be fully used.</p>

              <p>Hey guys on the side note with reference from a post by A Malaysian Man...with the rising fuel prices it have just got even more expensive to operate any armoured vehicles even though diesel is cheaper than petrol. We are not oil producing country like Malaysia with their Petronas so to sustain a long term armoured force in enemy terrrain is extremely costly for a tiny nation state like us.</p>
              <p>Maybe its time for us to look into alterantive power sources for our armoured vehicles? I mean we do have electric, hybrid, natural gas and hydrogen cars in limited numbers in Singapore already don't we?</p>
