            <div class='col-md body'>No sane person will use GPS-guided rounds for suppressive fires, not with its accuracy. Why not use it the same way the US uses it? Like the use of GPS rounds for responsive fire on high value targets, and normal rounds for suppression?  Its not as if there'll ALWAYS be CAS on call, yes? This seems a better way.<br><br>Also, I still cannot figure out why a guided round would be useful for ranging unguided rounds? A guided round will need no ranging, yes? Because its already guided, all that's needed is the precise coordinates of the desired aimpoint. But since its guided, how can it be used to range for unguided rounds? Please enlighten.</div>
