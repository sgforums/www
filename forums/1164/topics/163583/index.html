            <div class='col-md body'>WW2 is always THE WAR for me, because of the sheer global scope of the war and the lineup of combatants - from Europe to North Africa to Asia. The only true global war. WW1 was by and large too slow-paced - trench warfare/stalemate on the Western Front, and negligible Asia/Pacific action to speak of.<br><br>WW2 is also the last "interesting" war in that there were several "great powers" contending for supremacy, and also because there are so many alternate outcomes that might've been. What if the Germans didn't invade Russia, or declare war on the USA, what if the Japanese had not attacked the US etc etc.<br><br>After WW2, it became a "boring" bipolar world, with just the USA and the Soviet Union. Honestly, modern wars are soooo boring. Whereas WW2 had breathtaking campaigns with so much color/feel and dozens of divisions stretching for months - I find the Russo-German war absolutely fascinating - nowadays you get little inconclusive skirmishes or the US military simply flattening its opponent in an overwhelming concentration of steel and fire. Absolutely boring  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"></div>

I read from some books as well but it seem the massarce could be an accident. but i think it is inevidently that these soldiers will die sooner or later due because the german are take prisoner of war with them in a battle they are quite low on resources. if i remember correctlythis should happen at the ardennes forest right? during the siege of bastogne or battle at ardennes.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>discover channel show documentary on the less famous battle " battle of the bulge". </strong><br><br>i watch this documentary few days ago on discovery channel. but there seem to be different from some history books about the event.<br>it mention, the american soldiers at the town of bastogne (where famous BOB 101st  airborn division was station) was not relieve by the forces of flamboyant General Patton 3rd army. it had already manage to hold off germans attached from all direction by its own. but according to some history books, these american soldiers was save and relieve by the patton 3rd army when they break through the german lines and relieve the surronded american soldiers in the town of bastogne.<br><br>point 2. general patton was leading 4th army. but i tot he is leading 3rd army isnt it.<br><br>what i respectr this general so much is that he lead his men by the example. often appearing at the front lines with the men he lead.  he neber ask the men to do things he wouldnt do. after the battle of normandy he lead american forces dashing across 600 miles covering france, belgium, luxemburg, germany, austria, czech and liberate the buchenwald liberation camp.  unfortunately, he died in a car accident in 1945 and was buried together with the soldiers who died in the battle of the bulge.<br><br>to be frank, i never respected any officer during my time in NS. and kena confine few times for not saluting officer. but arent respect be earn rather than given.<br>another example of a good officer would be major winters inthe show Band of brothers. the way he care for the lives of the men from easy company. trying his best to lead by example, minimizing the lost. anyone can remeber how he fake a operation across the river during the final days of the war so that the men under his command would live beyond this war.(its a matter of time when  the german will surrender).<br><br></div>
