            <div class='col-md body'>Jets planes are hard to keep in formation because of the amount of power you need to input to increase speed. You can always overshoot. The easiest to keep in formation is the P-51, followed by the A-10 and then the F-15. The P-51 is probably going around 290 mph. For a F-15 to keep in formation at this speed needs some careful flying and throttle manipulation.</div>
