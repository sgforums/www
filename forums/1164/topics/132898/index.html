Simply estimate the range, draw a circle for probable launch sites and shoot anything that moves into site.

            <div class='col-md body'>ASTROS II is unguided, but then so are artillery shells. They have a pretty large CEP, so lots of missiles are fired to saturate an area.<br><br>To be honest, there is no counter to MLRS type systems. If someone wants to shoot it at you, there is no way to prevent yourself from being hit. The key is for us to ensure that that hit will not be fatal. This means force protection for the troops and civil defence for the civilians.<br><br>In terms of active force protection, it becomes even more important that we hit first. Our troops must be past the border and therefore dispersed, which will minimize the effect of an MLRS strike. If we are hit while our troops, equipment and ammo are still concentrated in their camps, it will be disasterous. Our planes must be in the air before MLRS disables the runways, and the first strike they deliver must be utterly devastating. The ships and subs must be at sea.<br><br>In terms of passive force protection measures, we need to invest in hardened aircraft shelters (HAS) and runway repair systems for the airforce, hardened ammo bunkers for the army and hardened C4IT systems for the whole force.<br><br>In terms of civil defence, it is important that civilians take it seriously. The vast majority of civilian casualties sustained during bombing are due to flying broken glass, so it is important that as hostilities become likely, everyone follows blackout instructions and tapes their windows. Our country is very strongly prepared for bombing, with numerous bomb shelters and tough, fire-resistant construction that will minimize civilian casualties. The only question is how bombing will affect morale. Historically, bombing of civilians increases the morale of both troops and civilians, but we will have to see if that's true in our case.<br><br>In war, men die. Just because we can be hit and hurt by MLRS does not mean we are defeated. We will just take casualties, and that's perfectly normal and perfectly alright. We will simply ensure that however many casualties we take, the enemy takes far more as we take his land from him. MLRS is just another weapon.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by tankee1981:</div><div class="quote_body">What are the ways to counter or minimise the damage done by a deliberate and sudden saturated rocket strike such as Astros. Do we use our Primus for counter attack or airstrike? How is our Primus compared with Astros?Thanks</div></blockquote><span style="color: darkred;">MLRS is a cost-effective mobile-rocket-based artillery system. It provides MAF's ability to neutralise SAF advantage, esp in the air power.<br><br>MLRS has the ability to rapid deployment hence reducing detection. It will temporarily deny effective operations of large/key bases and installation.<br><br>It will not, however, destroy nor permanently incapacitate them. IMO, MAF's MILRS serve more as a ability respond instead of providing 1st-strike ability. That, MAF knows, is still SAF's domain.<br><br>MAF knows also  MLRS does not hv  tactical projection flexibity in face of highly-mobilised and de-centralised adversary.<br><br>Limited manpower and land determine that SAF need to reduce such based-centric system to Net-centric C3I. That is why RMA is such critical development for the next 20 yrs.<br><br>Tactically, since MLRS is not a precison system nor capable of responding to a flexible and mobile units, as mentioned earlier. This means MLRS are best used during the initial (1st-strike) engagement on large static targets to ensure effective results. Unfortunately, this 1st-to-use window will be severly shortened or handicapped by both political and strategic factors.<br><br>For political factors, KL is fully aware how Singapore will response when she feels threatened. Forward defence. Simply put, having an effective deterrence by means of an offensive leaning military response, when all diplomacy become exhausted. And using MLRS on densely populated city-state will not pay dividend on the international stage, if not suicidal.<br><br>For the strategic (military) aspect, the SAF  already publicised available and operational sytems which reduces the need for base-centric C3I, in favour of a net-centric and decentralisation. That has been much emphasis its RMA affort in the pass and much more in the coming decade with consideration of counter-terrorist need.<br><br>In fact, such system are already available in SAF ORBAT. Basic UAVs, satallite, electronic/intel eaves droppings and TCP-IP based commsets. These systems already provide a foundation for a complete net-centic offensive force. On the  projection front, special forces have been integrated with remote systems and other mobile units like AH64.<br><br>Focus here is to provide flexible and rapid tactical changes in all possible conditions.<br><br>IMO,  MLRS is more of a political statement and a strategic answer via a cost-effective  tactical system to a nimble small adversary. MLRS will not threaten nor capable of achieving a knockout punch on such an opponent. That will require a complete re-evaluation of Malaysia's defence doctrine and procurement pattern.<br><br>I believe MLRS users know that full well. </span><br><br><img src="http://www.fas.org/man/dod-101/sys/land/row/astros-line-s.gif"></div>
