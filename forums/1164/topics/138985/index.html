            <div class='col-md body'>Finally it is revealed! I have seen it back in 2002 or 2003. If i didn't remembered wrongly, it should look like a Rapier system mounted on a M113 chasis just that have 4 missiles on each side of the launcher. When i seen it,it was transported along with another vehicle on a low-loader. Hopefully some of the forum members can take some photos during this year's NDP to verify my description. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"></div>

Hatch was open, vehicle in the stadium carpark, with lots of civilian participants moving around the mobile colume holding area.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>ADMS - Air Defense Mobile System</strong><br>- is an advanced, self-propelled air defense system.<br><br>ADMS implements state-of-the-art battle management techniques for integrated air defense battery operation, yielding excellent close defense to vital sites, units in the field and mobile combat units.<br><br>ADMS fires VSHORAD missiles. C4I techniques and automatic target engagement facilities enable fast reaction and full utilization of the missile potential performance. The system provides day, night and adverse weather defense against fixed wing and rotary wing air targets.Installed on Armored Personnel Carrier (APC) chassis, ADMS features all-terrain mobility.<br>ADMS also supports mission planning, battle debriefing, and training.<br><br>ADMS battery consists of a Surveillance and Command Unit (SCU) and several Missile Launching Units (MLU).<br><br>The number of MLUs in each battery is determined by the user.<br>The SCU detects and classifies the targets using a surveillance radar and an IFF system, and generates an Air Situation Picture (ASP). A battle management system designates targets to the MLUs, and automatically transmits the ASP and C2 data to the MLUs through a data communication network.<br><br>The MLUs acquire the targets using an electro-optical day/night sight system. Target acquisition is initiated by an automatic auto-slewing process. Each MLU carries four ready-to-fire missiles mounted on a lightweight overhead weapon station.<br><br>The MLU is designed to optimally operate in battery formation. It also features an excellent stand-alone, autonomous operation capability, where target search and detection are performed only with the sight system, without cueing from the SCU.<br><a href="http://www.rafael.co.il/web/rafnew/product...chures/adms.pdf" rel="nofollow">http://www.rafael.co.il/web/rafnew/product...chures/adms.pdf</a></div>
