Overall, the foreign market, for which it was designed, preferred to go for the F16 instead (owing largely to the fact that the USAF was using it), and a lack of sales killed it.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>To add-on to what other members had stated.<br><br>The F-20 was actually a 'by-product' of the Carter administration's policy of not arming friendly nations that are not cleared to receive top-of-the-line US fighters (esp F-16s).  This is part of the reson why the F-5 series is so successful in sales.<br><br>And given the large no. of F-5 users wordwide, Northrop had calculated that the F-20 (given its superior performance over the original F-5 series, it was decided to tag the much-improved F-5 the 'F-20' rather than upped it as another F-5G/H++) would easily scooped up by these users as a natural F-5 replacement.<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Reasons why the F-20 failed (internationally):</span><br><br>a) The Reagan Adminstration do not share the same qualms with the Carter Adminstration over the restriction of the export of top-of the-line fighters (F-16) to US-friendly nations and naturally gave the 'green light' for these nations to receive standard US fighters rather  than lower-end fighters (but this doesn't mean this fighters are not good).<br><br>b) The home user (USAF) was not a user of the F-20 (nations tend to see what the US itself uses.  This equally meant that any aircraft that is used by the US itself, could meant that the aircraft is not good.  Who would want to buy that?).<br><br>Therefore realising this non-US use handicap, Northrop submitted the F-20 to a USAF fly-off competition (in the mid/late 1980s) against the F-16 for a follow-on order (to add on to an earlier order of the F-16).<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Reasons why the F-20 lost to the F-16 in the fly-off</span>:<br><br>a) While acknowledging the F-20's performance, the USAF is not ready to introduce another air-to-air fighter whose role are fulfilled by the F-16 already.<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Alternative</span><br><br>Nevertheless, the F-20 was shown off to some nations:<br><br>a) South Korea:  The F-20 was shown to the South Korean top brass but the F-20 crashed during the demonstration!<br><br>b) Bahrain : Ordered 8 x F-20s.  But the number is too small to justify/start the production line.<br><br>c) Taiwan:  Northrop had thus tried to sell F-20 tools to the ROCAF.  Reasons failed I'm not too sure but could be that time, the Taiwanese is either interested in the F-16 or thinking of developing a indegenious figher ( the Ching-Kuo?)<br><br>Subsequently, some F-20 parts did find it's way into some these nations.  Noticeably the shark-nose radome of the F-20 onto the original F-5 radomes.<br>Look around if you don't believe me.<br><br>This is what I know, hope it helps.<br><br></div>
