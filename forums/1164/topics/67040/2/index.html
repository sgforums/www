            <div class='col-md body'>AA was really good back in the 90's. Viktor Pugachev n Anatoly Kvotchur with cobra, B-2, red arrows appearance. I really tot that AA was going to do better and maybe overtake the european shows as asia was the new market for planes.  whether the financial crisis had an impact i not sure.<br>Najib said on tv during his visit last AA that an airshow is not successful even though there is alot of attendance but how cost effective it is. he was hinting about the high costs involved at AA. make no mistake, malaysians are eyeing to take over AA with LIMA. they could afford the land and air space to hold a big show.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>if i am an aircraft manufacturer... i would be asking why bother to put B1B, F-117 and some exotic aircraft in singapore for display when its damn clear... USA aint gonna sell these planes to anyone in the first place!!??<br><br>F-111.... i thought this plane is gonna be in the graveyard soon... whose gonna buy this? libya?<br><br>i think the americans just got wiser... with a huge expense to cover in the occupation of iraq... such displays are not only unnecessary costly for no purpose.. but could also attract terrorist attacks...<br><br>i think AA needs to do some refocusing and find their goal... following western airshow may not be the useful thing...<br><br>as najib said... cost effective is important... not that we have to be cheap.. comeon... the price those planes are going for... those exhibitors aint grumpy over afew dollars... what they want is potential buisness to future buyers..!<br><br>the purpose of the show aint to show how many deals and how much were signed during airshows.. those are gimmicks... roadshow wayang...<br><br>NO leaders in the right frame of mind would sign on the dotted line over millions of dollars contract just becuase they saw the plane in singapore during AA.... or LIMA for that matter.<br><br>and to top it off... in the past.. the USA might be inclined to exhibit some of their top of the line aircraft for the purpose of emphasising its dominace in aerial technology to leaders of asian nations... a show of strength... with implications on diplomacy... if you get what i mean <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_twisted.gif" alt="Twisted Evil" title="Twisted Evil">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_twisted.gif" alt="Twisted Evil" title="Twisted Evil">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_twisted.gif" alt="Twisted Evil" title="Twisted Evil"><br><br>with the crushing defeat of IRAQ twice by the US airpower... there is no longer any need to put on such show...

            <div class='col-md body'>If we really want to make AA REALLY HAPPENING, then there must be lots of user particpation.<br><br>To do this, we must have a massive air show of 20,000 planes. How is this possible?<br><br>First we must develop an ultra light high subsonic airplane for civilian use. We have a domestic need for it. Cars are more or less restricted to roads and they are 2-dimensional creatures. They suffer when there's roadworks/ diversion/accident. And there's just not enough space for roads in Singapore.<br><br>Aircraft have no such restrictions, unfortunately there is no where else which have our unique situation. NS, lack of strategic depth, etc etc. So there are no aircraft which really suits our requirements.<br><br>-Single Pilot. (most of the traffic are sole passengers at office peak hours)<br>-Single Engine. Extremely fuel efficient.<br>-Able to land at extremely low speeds.<br>-Glider (won't stall)<br>-Capable of VSTOL.<br>-When folded up, able to fit into a carpark lot.<br>- under 2m in height while folded.<br>-Able to taxi while in folded position.<br>-Run on diesel.<br>-Can carry up to 1000kg of stuff. (modular) Passengers, bombs, etc.<br>-Can refuel mid air. Can buddy refuel.<br>-Must be as cheap as our cheapest car. (but our cars are damn expensive.)<br><br>Then LTA funds must be channeled into developing this plane. After all, they can't develop any more land based stuff and frankly, the LRT sucks. HDB also. They are also money suckers.<br><br>Then, our AA show will have 20,000 planes. We will have this new maneouvre that will even outclass the Su-37's "kulbit", called the "solar eclipse". (get enough planes to block up the sun).<br><br>Confirm a lot of foreign balls would drop. Confirm a lot of attendance. Confirm you'll go to it if it happens. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz"></div>
