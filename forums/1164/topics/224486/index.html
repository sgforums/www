            </div>
            <div class='col-md body'>I recently encountered this news article which I think is worthy of discussion here and a lot more of a deeper thought. The article is about this recent marksmanship competition involving ASEAN nations and China, Japan and Korea. The competition is intitiated by PRC and held in China as an effort to boost relationship between Asean and East Asia.<br>The translation is as follow........<br>The competition involves 8 segments. China won 2 gold medals in the individual events, 30 rds pistol. While Malaysia bags the Gold medal for both individual and team lvl 3x20 assault rifle segment. On the following day, Malaysia bagged another gold for the 60 rds prone position shooting. In these events, all nations use standard issued rifles they have been using in their army. In this competition, only Indonesia, Japan and Korea did not send observers. Asean nations praises this event as a meaningful cooperation with East Asian nations.<br><br>Ok, this are some of my thoughts on this event. Considering this competition is an international one involving so many nations, all nations most probably send their best shooting teams to the competition. Due to the fact that I can't seem to copy the entire essay due to problems, those follow up essay says China was using their new Type 95 bullpup while Malaysian were using the M-16, this could facilitate a good comparison between conventional and bullpup. I have read before on some other arms forum that bullpup have this innate problem of reduce in accuracy at longer distance. This was bcos of the shorten barrel due to shorter gun. Thus usually bullpup comes with scopes to ratify this issue. But with scope, with my own experience target accuqistion becomes slower due to the fact the view in the scope is exaggerated. This was even more apparent when u are likr 100+m from the target. The magnification of the scope also exaggerates ur error due to breathing techniques and rifle handling. So during the competition, could the Chinese team have suffered from this fate? Besides, the article says the competiton involves a segment of 60rds shooting in prone position. As we all noe the Chinese use 5.8mm rounds, their mag is longer than 5.56mm mag, could this mean slower change in magazine and also poor rifle balancing due to the fact, the longer mag forces the shooter to prone "higher".<br><br>Wad are ur views on this issue? Perhaps u can add in ur own experience during ATP, or section lvl life firing....<br><br>Ã‰Ã¤Â»Ã·Â±ÃˆÃˆÃ¼Â£ÂºÃŽÃ’Â¾Ã¼Ã“ÃƒÃ–Ã†ÃŠÂ½Â²Â½Ã‡Â¹Â²Ã’Â°ÃœÂ¸Ã¸Ã‚Ã­Ã€Â´<br><br>Â±Â±Â¾Â©10Ã”Ã‚19ÃˆÃ•ÂµÃ§Â¡Â¡Â¼Ã‡Ã•ÃŸÂ·Â¶Â½Â­Â»Â³Â±Â¨ÂµÃ€Â£ÂºÂ¶Â«ÃƒÃ‹Ã“Ã«Ã–Ã�ÃˆÃ•ÂºÂ«ÃŽÃ¤Ã—Â°Â²Â¿Â¶Ã“Â¾Ã¼Ã“ÃƒÃ‡Â¹Ã‰Ã¤Â»Ã·Â±ÃˆÃˆÃ¼Â½Ã±ÃŒÃ¬Ã”ÃšÂ¾Â©Ã‚Ã¤Ã�Ã‚Ã¡Â¡Ã„Â»Â£Â¬<br><br>Ã”ÃšÃ—ÃœÂ¹Â²Â°Ã‹Â¸Ã¶Â±ÃˆÃˆÃ¼Ã�Ã®Ã„Â¿Ã–Ã�Â£Â¬Ã‚Ã­Ã€Â´ÃŽÃ·Ã‘Ã‡Â¶Ã“Â»Ã±ÂµÃƒ6ÃƒÂ¶Â½Ã°Ã…Ã†Â£Â¬Ã–Ã�Â¹ÃºÂ¶Ã“Â»Ã±ÂµÃƒ2ÃƒÂ¶Â½Ã°Ã…Ã†Â¡Â£<br><br>Â¡Â¡Â¡Â¡Ã”ÃšÂ½Ã±ÃŒÃ¬Â½Ã¸Ã�Ã�ÂµÃ„Ã„Ã�Ã—Ã“ÃŠÃ–Ã‡Â¹30Â·Â¢Ã‹Ã™Ã‰Ã¤Â±ÃˆÃˆÃ¼Ã–Ã�Â£Â¬Ã–Ã�Â¹ÃºÃ‘Â¡ÃŠÃ–Â¶Ã¡ÂµÃƒÃ�Ã…ÃŒÃ¥Â¹ÃšÂ¾Ã¼Â¡Â£Ã”ÃšÂ¸ÃƒÃ�Ã®Ã„Â¿ÂµÃ„Â¸Ã¶ÃˆÃ‹ÃˆÃ¼Ã–Ã�Â£Â¬ÃŽÃ’Â¾Ã¼Ã‘Â¡ÃŠÃ–Ã�ÃµÃ‘Ã‡Â¶Â«Ã’Ã”270Â»Â·ÂµÃ„Â³Ã‰Â¼Â¨Â¶Ã¡Â¹ÃšÂ£Â¬ÃŽÃ’Â¾Ã¼Ã�Ã­Ã�Ã¢Ã’Â»ÃƒÃ»Ã‘Â¡ÃŠÃ–Â½Ã°Ã“Â¾ÂµÃ‚Â»Ã±ÂµÃƒÃ’Ã¸Ã…Ã†Â¡Â£<br><br>Â¡Â¡Â¡Â¡Ã”ÃšÃ„Ã�Ã—Ã“Â²Â½Ã‡Â¹3Â¡Ã�20ÂµÃ„Â±ÃˆÃˆÃ¼Ã–Ã�Â£Â¬Ã‚Ã­Ã€Â´ÃŽÃ·Ã‘Ã‡Â¶Ã“Â°Ã¼Ã€Â¿Ã�Ã‹Ã�Ã…ÃŒÃ¥ÂºÃ�Â¸Ã¶ÃˆÃ‹Â½Ã°Ã…Ã†Â¡Â£<br><br>Â¡Â¡Â¡Â¡Â±Â±Â¾Â©10Ã”Ã‚18ÃˆÃ•ÂµÃ§ Â¼Ã‡Ã•ÃŸÂ·Â¶Â½Â­Â»Â³Â±Â¨ÂµÃ€Â£ÂºÂ¶Â«ÃƒÃ‹Ã“Ã«Ã–Ã�ÃˆÃ•ÂºÂ«ÃŽÃ¤Ã—Â°Â²Â¿Â¶Ã“Â¾Ã¼Ã“ÃƒÃ‡Â¹Ã‰Ã¤Â»Ã·Â±ÃˆÃˆÃ¼Â½Ã±ÃŒÃ¬Â¾Ã¶Â³Ã¶Ã‹Ã„ÃƒÂ¶Â½Ã°Ã…Ã†Â¡Â£Ã‚Ã­Ã€Â´ÃŽÃ·Ã‘Ã‡Â¶Ã“Â³Ã‰ÃŽÂªÂ½Ã±ÃŒÃ¬Â±ÃˆÃˆÃ¼ÂµÃ„Ã—Ã®Â´Ã³Ã“Â®Â¼Ã’Â£Â¬Â°Ã¼Ã€Â¿Ã�Ã‹Ã‹Ã¹Â²ÃºÃ‰ÃºÂµÃ„Ã‹Ã„ÃƒÂ¶Â½Ã°Ã…Ã†Â£Â¬Ã–Ã�Â¹ÃºÂ¶Ã“Â½Ã¶Â»Ã±ÂµÃƒÃ’Â»ÃƒÂ¶Ã’Ã¸Ã…Ã†Â¡Â£<br><br>Â¡Â¡Â¡Â¡Ã”ÃšÃ„Ã�Ã—Ã“ÃŠÃ–Ã‡Â¹30Â·Â¢Â¾Â«Â¶ÃˆÃ‰Ã¤ÂµÃ„Â±ÃˆÃˆÃ¼Ã–Ã�Â£Â¬Ã‚Ã­Ã€Â´ÃŽÃ·Ã‘Ã‡Â¶Ã“ÂµÃ„Ã‚ÃžÃ‹Â¹Ã€Â¼Ã’Ã”275Â»Â·ÂµÃ„Â³Ã‰Â¼Â¨Â¶Ã¡ÂµÃƒÂ¹ÃšÂ¾Ã¼Â£Â¬Ã–Ã�Â¹ÃºÃ‘Â¡ÃŠÃ–Â½Ã°Ã“Â¾ÂµÃ‚Â»Ã±ÂµÃƒÃ‘Ã‡Â¾Ã¼Â¡Â£Ã”ÃšÃ•Ã¢Â¸Ã¶Ã�Ã®Ã„Â¿ÂµÃ„Ã�Ã…ÃŒÃ¥Â±ÃˆÃˆÃ¼Ã–Ã�Â£Â¬Ã–Ã�Â¹ÃºÂ¶Ã“Ã’Ã”754Â»Â·ÂµÃ„Â³Ã‰Â¼Â¨ÃƒÃ»Ã�Ã�ÂµÃšÃ‹Ã„ÃƒÃ»Â¡Â£Ã„Ã�Ã—Ã“Â²Â½Ã‡Â¹60Â·Â¢ÃŽÃ”Ã‰Ã¤ÂµÃ„Â¸Ã¶ÃˆÃ‹Â¡Â¢Ã�Ã…ÃŒÃ¥Â½Ã°Ã…Ã†Ã’Â²Â¾Ã¹Â±Â»Ã‚Ã­Ã€Â´ÃŽÃ·Ã‘Ã‡Â¶Ã“Â¶Ã¡ÂµÃƒÂ¡Â£<br><br>Â¡Â¡Â¡Â¡Â±Â¾Â´ÃŽÂ±ÃˆÃˆÃ¼Â¸Ã·Â²ÃŽÃˆÃ¼Â´ÃºÂ±Ã­Â¶Ã“ÃŠÂ¹Ã“ÃƒÂµÃ„Â±ÃˆÃˆÃ¼Ã“ÃƒÃ‡Â¹Â£Â¬Â¾Ã¹ÃŽÂªÂ¸Ã·Â¹ÃºÂ¾Ã¼Â¶Ã“ÂµÃ„Ã—Â°Â±Â¸Ã“ÃƒÃ‡Â¹Â¡Â£<br><br>Â¡Â¡Â¡Â¡Ã–Ã�Ã�Ã‚Ã‰Ã§Â±Â±Â¾Â©ÃŠÂ®Ã”Ã‚ÃŠÂ®Ã†ÃŸÃˆÃ•ÂµÃ§(Â¼Ã‡Ã•ÃŸÂ¡Â¡ÃŒÃ•Ã‰Ã§Ã€Â¼)Ã–Ã�Â¹ÃºÂ¾Ã¼Â·Â½Ã–Ã·Â°Ã¬ÂµÃ„Â¶Â«ÃƒÃ‹Ã“Ã«Ã–Ã�ÃˆÃ•ÂºÂ«(ÃŠÂ®Â£Â«ÃˆÃ½)ÃŽÃ¤Ã—Â°Â²Â¿Â¶Ã“Â¾Ã¼Ã“ÃƒÃ‡Â¹Ã‰Ã¤Â»Ã·Â±ÃˆÃˆÃ¼Â½Ã±ÃŒÃ¬Ã”ÃšÂ±Â±Â¾Â©Â¿ÂªÃ„Â»Â£Â¬ÃŠÂ®ÃˆÃ½Â¹Ãº(Â°Ã¼Ã€Â¨Ã–Ã�Â¹Ãº)Â¹Â²Ã’Â»Â°Ã™Ã�Ã£ÃŽÃ¥ÃˆÃ‹Â²ÃŽÃˆÃ¼Â¡Â£Ã•Ã¢ÃŠÃ‡ÃŠÂ®Â£Â«ÃˆÃ½Â¿Ã²Â¼ÃœÃ„ÃšÃŠÃ—Â´ÃŽÂ¾Ã™Â°Ã¬ÂµÃ„Â¾Ã¼ÃŠÃ‚ÃŒÃ¥Ã“Ã½Ã�Ã¬Ã“Ã²Â½Â»Ã�Ã·Â»Ã®Â¶Â¯Â¡Â£<br><br>Â¡Â¡Â¡Â¡Ã—ÃœÂ²ÃŽÂ¾Ã¼Ã‘ÂµÂºÃ�Â±Ã¸Ã–Ã–Â²Â¿Â¸Â±Â²Â¿Â³Â¤Â³Ã‚Ã•Ã•ÂºÂ£Ã‰Ã™Â½Â«Ã”ÃšÂ¿ÂªÃ„Â»ÃŠÂ½Ã‰Ã�Ã–Ã‚Â´Ã‡Ã‹ÂµÂ£Â¬Â¶Â«ÃƒÃ‹Ã“Ã«Ã–Ã�ÃˆÃ•ÂºÂ«ÂºÃ�Ã—Ã·Â»ÃºÃ–Ã†ÃŠÃ‡Â¶Â«Ã‘Ã‡Â¹ÃºÂ¼Ã’Â¼Ã“Ã‡Â¿Ã‡Ã¸Ã“Ã²ÂºÃ�Ã—Ã·ÂµÃ„Ã“Ã�Ã�Â§Ã†Â½ÃŒÂ¨Â¡Â£Â¼Ã“Ã‡Â¿Â¶Â«ÃƒÃ‹Ã“Ã«Ã–Ã�ÃˆÃ•ÂºÂ«Â¹ÃºÂ¼Ã’Â¾Ã¼Â¶Ã“Ã–Â®Â¼Ã¤ÂµÃ„Â½Â»Ã�Ã¹Ã“Ã�Ã€Ã»Ã“ÃšÃ‰Ã®Â»Â¯Â´Â«Ã�Â³Ã“Ã‘Ã’ÃªÂ£Â¬Ã”Ã¶Â½Ã¸Ã�Ã Â»Â¥Ã�Ã‹Â½Ã¢Â£Â¬Â¼Ã“Ã‰Ã®Ã�Ã Â»Â¥Ã�Ã…ÃˆÃŽÂ£Â¬ÃŽÂªÃŽÂ¬Â»Â¤Ã‘Ã‡ÃŒÂ«ÂµÃ˜Ã‡Ã¸Ã„Ã‹Ã–Ã�ÃŠÃ€Â½Ã§ÂµÃ„ÂºÃ�Ã†Â½ÂºÃ�ÃŽÃˆÂ¶Â¨Â·Â¢Â»Ã“Â»Ã½Â¼Â«Ã—Ã·Ã“ÃƒÂ£Â¬Â¶Ã¸Â¾Ã¼ÃŠÃ‚ÃŒÃ¥Ã“Ã½Ã”Ã²ÃŠÃ‡Â·Â¢Ã•Â¹Â¾Ã¼Â¶Ã“Â¼Ã¤Ã“Ã‘ÂºÃƒÂ¹Ã˜Ã�ÂµÂµÃ„ÃŽÃ±ÃŠÂµÃ�Ã”ÂºÃ�Ã—Ã·Ã�Ã¬Ã“Ã²Â£Â¬Â¸Ã·Â¹ÃºÂ¾Ã¼Â¶Ã“ÂµÃ„Ã�Â¬Ã�Ã�ÃƒÃ‡Â´Ã¸Ã—Ã…Â¾Ã¼Ã“Ãƒ****Ã€Â´ÂµÂ½Ã–Ã�Â¹ÃºÂ£Â¬Â²Â»ÃŠÃ‡ÃŽÂªÃ�Ã‹Â¶Ã”Â¿Â¹Â£Â¬Â¶Ã¸ÃŠÃ‡ÃŽÂªÃ�Ã‹Â·Â¢Ã•Â¹Ã“Ã‘Ã’ÃªÂ¡Â£ÂµÂ±Â½Ã±ÂµÃ„ÃŠÃ€Â½Ã§Ã�Ã¨Ã’ÂªÂºÃ�Ã†Â½Â¡Â¢Â°Â²Ã„Ã¾ÂºÃ�Ã�Ã–ÂµÃœÃ‡Ã©Ã’ÃªÂ¡Â£Ã–Ã�Â¹ÃºÃˆÃ‹ÃƒÃ±Â½Ã¢Â·Ã…Â¾Ã¼Ã„ÃœÃŽÂªÂ¼Ã“Ã‡Â¿Â¶Â«ÃƒÃ‹ÂºÃ�Ã–Ã�ÃˆÃ•ÂºÂ«Â¿Ã²Â¼ÃœÃ„ÃšÂµÃ„ÂºÃ�Ã—Ã·Â·Â¢Â»Ã“Ã—Ã·Ã“ÃƒÂ£Â¬Â¸Ã�ÂµÂ½ÃŠÂ®Â·Ã–Â½Â¾Â°Ã�Â¡Â£<br><br>Â¡Â¡Â¡Â¡Ã•Ã¢Â´ÃŽÃ‰Ã¤Â»Ã·Â±ÃˆÃˆÃ¼ÃŽÂªÃ†ÃšÃˆÃ½ÃŒÃ¬Â£Â¬Â³Ã½Ã“Â¡Ã„Ã¡Â¡Â¢ÃˆÃ•Â±Â¾Â¡Â¢ÂºÂ«Â¹ÃºÃ“Ã‰Â¹Ã›Â²Ã¬Ã”Â±Â²ÃŽÂ¼Ã“Ã�Ã¢Â£Â¬Ã†Ã¤Ã“Ã Â¾Ã¹Ã…Ã‰Â³Ã¶Ã”Ã‹Â¶Â¯Â¶Ã“Â²ÃŽÃˆÃ¼Â£Â¬Ã–Ã�Â¹ÃºÃ“Ã�ÃŠÂ®Ã’Â»ÃˆÃ‹Â²ÃŽÃˆÃ¼Â¡Â£ÃŽÃ„Ã€Â³Â¡Â¢Ã�Ã‚Â¼Ã“Ã†Ã‚Â¡Â¢Â·Ã†Ã‚Ã‰Â±Ã¶Â¡Â¢Ã‚Ã­Ã€Â´ÃŽÃ·Ã‘Ã‡ÂµÃˆÂ¶Â«ÃƒÃ‹Â¹ÃºÂ¼Ã’Ã’Ã”Â¼Â°ÂºÂ«Â¹ÃºÃ†Ã•Â±Ã©Â¸ÃŸÂ¶ÃˆÃ†Ã€Â¼Ã›Â´Ã‹Â´ÃŽÂ»Ã®Â¶Â¯ÂµÃ„Ã’Ã¢Ã’Ã¥Â£Â¬Â»Ã½Â¼Â«Â¿Ã�Â¶Â¨Ã–Ã�Â·Â½ÃŽÂªÂ´Ã‹Â´ÃŽÂ±ÃˆÃˆÃ¼Ã’Ã”Â¼Â°ÃŽÂªÂ´Ã™Â½Ã¸ÃŠÂ®Â£Â«ÃˆÃ½Â¹ÃºÂ¼Ã’Ã”ÃšÂ¾Ã¼ÃŠÃ‚Ã�Ã¬Ã“Ã²ÂµÃ„Â½Â»Ã�Ã·Ã“Ã«ÂºÃ�Ã—Ã·Ã‹Ã¹Ã—Ã¶Â³Ã¶ÂµÃ„Ã…Â¬Ã�Â¦Â¡Â£<br><br>Â¡Â¡Â¡Â¡Ã–Ã�Â¹ÃºÃˆÃ‹ÃƒÃ±Â½Ã¢Â·Ã…Â¾Ã¼Â¸Â±Ã—ÃœÂ²ÃŽÃ„Â±Â³Â¤Â¸Ã°Ã•Ã±Â·Ã¥Ã‰Ã�Â½Â«Â¡Â¢Â¹ÃºÂ·Ã€Â²Â¿Ã�Ã¢ÃŠÃ‚Â°Ã¬Â¹Â«ÃŠÃ’Â¸Â±Ã–Ã·ÃˆÃŽÂ¶Â¡Â½Ã¸Â¹Â¥Ã‰Ã™Â½Â«Â¡Â¢Â²ÃŽÃˆÃ¼Â¸Ã·Â¹ÃºÂ´ÃºÂ±Ã­Ã�Ã…Â¼Â°Ã—Â¤Â»ÂªÃŽÃ¤Â¹Ã™Â³Ã¶Ã�Â¯Ã�Ã‹Â½Ã±ÃŒÃ¬ÂµÃ„Â¿ÂªÃ„Â»ÃŠÂ½Â¡Â£</div>

In fact, believe it or not the purpose of the creation of the bullpup is to actually facilitate the accomodation of a full-sized barrel on the weapon while keeping its size compact. Unlike a carbine which takes compromises on the barrel length for is size. The M16's barrel length is 508mm while the Type 95's (assuming they are using the full length version) is 490mm, so its actually not much of a difference. Compare the M16's barrel to the M4's barrel which stands at 368.3 mm which is almost 5.5inches shorter then that of the M16's.</div>

I was comparing conventional and bullpup. Aniway, I also heard a fare share of complaints on Chinese military webbies that their type 95 have lots of issues. Isist bcos Chinese manufacturing standards are poor? Or isit the 5.8mm rounds are naturally deficient in design?<br><br>The part on proning. I was referring to the mag is longer, thus won't it cause their CG to be move higher up, thus sacrificing stability.<br><br>Bcos last time I went for this so called immediate action drill range. In which the section will line up 20m to the target and the target suddenly pop up and u must shoot both immediately as they collapse fast. In the end,it was surprising to note, those M-16 sharpshooter fared the poorest, due to their slow target aquisition while SAR-21 fared a little better. But when it came to mag changing, the SAR-21 was one of the slowest, eventhough the length of the weapon is the shortest.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>what?? 20 m to target and the M-16 lost? Whats happening man...  I find the m-16 to be one of the most forgiving weapon to use at close range without really looking thru the sights. At 20 meters to target, I wouldn't glue my eye down sight.<br><br>One thing about the effectiveness of the bullpup scopes, esp Sar-21.  A shooter must really learn to shoot with both eyes open before he can hope to quickly acquire and down the target. To do that with the M-16 requires more experience and skill.<br><br></div>

I was comparing conventional and bullpup. Aniway, I also heard a fare share of complaints on Chinese military webbies that their type 95 have lots of issues. Isist bcos Chinese manufacturing standards are poor? Or isit the 5.8mm rounds are naturally deficient in design?<br><br>The part on proning. I was referring to the mag is longer, thus won't it cause their CG to be move higher up, thus sacrificing stability.<br><br>Bcos last time I went for this so called immediate action drill range. In which the section will line up 20m to the target and the target suddenly pop up and u must shoot both immediately as they collapse fast. In the end,it was surprising to note, those M-16 sharpshooter fared the poorest, due to their slow target aquisition while SAR-21 fared a little better. But when it came to mag changing, the SAR-21 was one of the slowest, eventhough the length of the weapon is the shortest.</div></blockquote>serious?at 20m? BTP?if it is then i had no problems leh,1.5sec sec to accquire target and safety off,0.5 or 1sec  to squeeze trigger....before 3 secs i shoot liao.target stays up for 4 secs rite?<br>Then again SAR-21 easier to get target in scope and then at 100m ur target is freaking huge compared to the M16.But reloading is a problem and most definately slower by alot</div>

Remember ur Fibua drill? It goes something like that. It simulates that ur section is patrolling in an urban ops with civilian elements around. Suddenly a hostile target appears and u must use the drill to hit them, like enemy left, enemy right, enemy at the back. Two figure, one fig 12 one fig 15 will pop up and u must hit both within 7-8 sec. The M-16 fared badly due to the 4x scope. It literally gave the sharpshooter a hell of a time hunting for the target, thus usually they only managed one target at best. I feel that they should serioudly invest on the red dot reflex aimpoint as it would ratify the above prob.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>AFAIK, the SAR-21 uses the normal M-16 barrel length, so their ballastic features must be more or less the same. The bullpup cuts the overall length by changing the configuration, not shortening the barrel. There are SAR micro versons I heard that use the M-4 carbine barrel length, and these are even smaller.<br><br>I think bullpups and conventional layouts have their own pros and cons, it really boils down to how well you want to adapt your tatics or make new ones to make up for them.<br><br>But to be objective, the SAR-21 offers some very important pros over the M-16. Targets are a lot easier to engage with the SAR as you do not have to worry about a proper sight picture, if you sight down the scope properly you have it there liao. Also the compact frame of the SAR makes aiming easier and you can snap off a shot a lot faster. Under the stress of battle this is extremely important, and equates to an increase in combat effectiveness, not to mention your chance of getting out alive.<br><br>In the cons section reloading takes slightly longer, but I think I prefer having each of my 30 rounds easier to aim and shoot then to trade it for faster reloading.<br><br>Aye, not to mention the weapon jams far less and is easier to maintain as well. More importantly, it can eat more sand and mud and keep going after the M-16's bolt is stuck in the buffer. That said, I like that little plastic rifle despite its quirks that has made some people detest it. And the LAD is extremely useful in FIBUA and night fighting if used properly as well.<br><br>But they really should give the SAR a proper set of iron sights, you know, for the old fashioned grunt in all of us. Sometimes when I shoot with the SAR, I realized using the scope backup pistol sight is good enough, and allows you to adopt a more comfortable firing position without worrying about putting your head to the scope. And yeah, it works up to 200 meters on fig 11!</div>
