              <p>Dear fellow Singaporeans<br><br>I am a Singaporean historian looking to
              speak to people who remember the British bases and their withdrawal in
              the early 1970s. The withdrawal was the first major crisis independent
              Singapore faced. The 56 bases, contributing a fifth of the country’s
              GDP, were its largest industry, and the pullout threatened the
              livelihood of one-sixth of the labour force, including an estimated
              8,000 amahs.<br> <br>The pullout also transformed the economy, society and landscape of
              Singapore in the 1970s. Most of the bases were converted to commercial
              use, while many base workers underwent a 3-month retraining crash
              course. Technical and vocational education also expanded, as new laws
              sought to increase labour productivity and attract foreign capital
              investment.<br> <br>These developments resonate with us today: the retraining
              programmes, the mobilisation of the young, the philosophy that ‘no one
              owes Singapore a living’. There is also a forgotten social history to
              unearth: how retrenched base employees coped with the crisis and how
              workers adjusted to new work routines.<br> <br>If you remember the British bases and rundown, or have a family

              <p>It is good that Britain withdrew the bases.</p>
              <p>But PAP govt, always wanting the backing of the west, invited U.S to set up bases.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Verdana,sans-serif;"><span style="font-size: x-small;"><strong>Serving British interests </strong><br><br>"Now,
                  				from all the already released records in London as well as other
                  				historical researches, it is clear that in launching Operation
                  				Cold Store, Lee Kuan Yew was serving the then strategic interests
                  				of Britain which wanted Singapore to continue to provide a
                  				forward military base in Southeast Asia," said Lim <br><br>"It
                  				is also now an undeniable fact that Lee worked earlier for the
                  				Japanese military during the Occupation making Britain's English
                  				materials available in Japanese-language for the occupiers,"
                  				he added. <br><br>Lim was a graduate of Singapore's prestigious
                  				Raffles College and a medical doctor trained in University of
                  				Malaya, which was then located in Singapore. <br><br>"I was
                  				also a founder of University of Malaya's Socialist Club which
                  				became the cradle for many politicians and intellectuals in both
                  				Malaysia and Singapore who fought for independence," he
                  				recalled with a sense of pride. <br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>"In those days,
                  				anti-colonialism was a very powerful and popular sentiment even
                  				in Singapore … I helped found the People's Action Party
                  				(PAP) to fight for the freedom of Singapore from British rule</strong></span> and
                  				to reunite it with Peninsula to form an united, non-communal and
                  				progressive Malaya but <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>when Lee turned right wing and started
                  				serving British interests, the party split and I left to join the
                  				Socialist Front,"</strong></span> he explained. <br><br>"<span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>We certainly
                  				opposed to Singapore being maintained as a military base for
                  				Britain and that was why Lee had to crush the Left in Singapore
                  				at all cost</strong></span> … The Left in Singapore also opposed to the
                  				1963 merger because we thought it was an opportunistic adventure
                  				on the part of Lee who wanted to exploit Tunku Abdul Rahman's
                  				anti-communism to suppress the Left in Singapore … we
                  				wanted merger but not in the 1963 version which proved to be an
                  				utter failure just two years later in 1965. <br><br>"I was
                  				completely English-educated," stressed Lim, which was
                  				obviously a sarcastic and subtle rebuttal to the <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>now stereotyped
                  				and widespread notion that the Left in Singapore in the 1950s and
                  				1960s was a "Chinese-educated" phenomenon. </strong></span></span></span></p>

              <p>There is a possibility of 56 British Military Installations in Singapore, while the obvious ones are well known, some of the lesser known have given way to the modernising of Singapore.</p>
              <p>Other then the domestic help employed by the families of the married British Military Personnels, the other economic beneficiaries of their presences will include the many landlords that rented their homes, the locals recruited to civilian administrative posts, and the locals recruited to serve as Military Camp Police, and also locals recruited to provide their skills in the repair and maintenance of the military hardware, and act as liason in commercial transactions with local suppliers.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>The Naval Base</strong> - is the largest British Base covering the area that begins at the eastern edge outlined by the present Sembawang Road till its end at the Straits of Johor; the western edge is where the present Woodland HDB blocks lie adjacent to the Woodlands ICQ, and the southern edge outlined by the present SLE.</p>
              <p>The main entrance to the Naval Base was located at the present day traffic light junction at Canberra Road and Sembawang Road.</p>
              <p>The present day Sun Plaza and all the adjacent HDB flats are located in a desolate part of the land area within the Naval Base, with the Admiralty House sitting on a hill crest that serves as the residence of the Admiral of the Far East Fleet - now used as a Clubhouse with karaoke and swimming pool facilities.</p>
              <p>The main feature of the Naval Base is the wharf and dry docks that is part of the present day Sembawang Shipyard, and had employed more then 10,000 locals to man the various specialist workshops that still exist in their original architecture.</p>
              <p>There must be another 5,000 workers employed to keep the Naval Base in good condition in the various posts of civilian administrators, contractors, civilian operators of the different mess for officers and other rank and file.</p>
              <p><strong></strong></p>
              <p><strong>The Sembawang Air Base</strong> - sits on the southern edge of the Naval Base was used as a Royal Navy Air Station.</p>
              <p>Local workers are employed as civilian administrators to manage the running of the air base - as well as the administration of logistics.</p>
              <p><strong></strong></p>
              <p><strong>Changi Air Base</strong> - sits to the east of Singapore island, and consist of a single 1 km runway next to the Changi beach shore line. </p>
              <p>The original Changi Beach shoreline runs about 500 to 1000 meters left of the ECP leading into the present Changi Airport.</p>
              <p>The old runway which faces Terminal 3 is the original RAF runway - which was made longer and upgraded to bear the weight of heavier modern commercial airlines; with the remaining portions of the present Changi International Airport facilites all sitting entirely on reclaimed land.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>Seletar Air Base</strong> - sits on the edge of the northern shores of Singapore island, and had a single air strip sitting on a sprawling greenery that remains about the same to this day - if one does not forget to include the present day Seletar Golf Club. </p>
              <p>Besides the single runway, there exist also a separate slipway that allow operation of Flying Boats.</p>
              <p>The pilots and Officers with families lived a lifestyle that is almost a transplanted settings from Britain, while some others will live off-the-base in rented homes around the air base and as far away as Serangoon Gardens, Seletar Estate, and Sembawang Hills Estate.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>Tengah Air Base</strong> - is the most important of the three RAF bases, with a single runway, and with the property about the same as its historical past.</p>
              <p>The set up of Tengah Air Base is near identical to Changi Air Base, and seems to be strategically placed to cover different defense arcs of anticipated air threats.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Besides these main bases, there were the other logistic bases located at - Sungei Kadut - near to the railway track crossing; the Hong Kah Ammo Base facility; Tanglin Barracks at Dempsey Road - which also included the Military Detention Facility; the Ayer Rajah facility; Buller Camp in Queenstown; Mowbray Camp in Ulu Pandan; Gillman Barracks at Alexandra Road; Selarang Barracks at Upper Changi; Gloucester Barracks; The Slim Barracks; Fort Siloso and Fort Serapong at Sentosa (previously known as Pulau Blakang Mati).</p>

              <p><img src="http://i209.photobucket.com/albums/bb111/atobe-album/The_Britannia_Club_72dpi-1.jpg" alt=""></p>
              <p> There was the Britania Club with a NAAFI market located at Beach Road facing Raffles Hotel. This property belongs to the British Military, and is the club house for the Rank and File of all the services.</p>
              <p>There was a C-in-C residence located near the Kheam Hock Road - Dunearn Road area, and known as Command House as seen in a brass signage at the gate post.</p>

              <p>Besides the main British Military Forces, they also created the British Army Depot Police that consisted of locals being recruited to guard the various British Military Bases and Logistic Facilities - and were located at 3 separate bases, one of which was at 3 Base Ordnance Depot off Alexandra Road.</p>
              <p>There was also the British Naval Police Force and the RAF Police Auxillaries - both manned by British Officers commanding locals recruited into the British Service.</p>

              <p><br>No way, that will put me as old as LKY, but I know of neighbors who rented their homes in the 1960s, met individuals working as chefs in the mess, also some who had worked as contractors, and of course the volunteers to the Auxiliary Police Force.</p>
              <p>The withdrawal of the British Military from Singapore was quite well organised as Harold Wilson gave his assurance to Tunku and LKY that the withdrawal will be conducted in phases that will not jeopardised the security of Southeast Asia, and also to LKY's position in the local politics.</p>
              <p>With each phased pull-out, the vacated bases were quickly put into use either by the SAF, or handed over to the newly set up Singapore Government Linked Companies to fully utilise the assets for commercial applications.</p>
              <p>Singapore had the good fortune of the advise from Dutch Economic Consultant - Dr Albert Winsemius - who had also recommended LKY to visit Cyprus and study how they had capitalised on the withdrawal of the British Military from Cyprus and convert the naval bases for commercial use.</p>
              <p>There was no major structural disruption that caused severe negative shocks to the Singapore economy, no strikes, no jobs losses that left massive unemployment for long period as experienced by those affected by the economic downturn of 2004.</p>
              <p><a rel="nofollow" href="http://newspapers.nl.sg/Digitised/TOC.aspx?issueid=straitstimes19780111">‘Singapore Straits Time, 11 January 1978 – reported Lee Kuan Yew publicly acknowledged for the first time – Singapore owe a debt to Harold Wilson ’ (*1) </a>- when as a Private UK Citizen, he was invited as a Special Guest of Singapore and feted to a State Banquet in his honor.</p>
              <p>That debt was two fold - the first for saving LKY and his cabinet from being arrested by Tunku's Federal Government, and the second for saving Singapore's economy from a disastrous collapse from the sudden withdrawal of the British Military.</p>

              <p><br>Sorry for the mix-up, always got the two islands mixed up - must be their proximity being in the same region, and both with Greek influence.</p>
              <p>The following blog had some details that will be relevant to your research, which also featured a letter from you -<a href="http://victorkoo.blogspot.com/2009/11/british-withdrawal-from-singapore.html">http://victorkoo.blogspot.com/2009/11/british-withdrawal-from-singapore.html</a></p>
              <p>You could try to get a list of academecians, who were in the Political Science and Economics Faculties at NUS during the 1960s through 1970s - who will probably have observed the impact and written papers about the withdrawal of the British Military on the local economy.</p>
              <p>The other source will be the Straits Times archive that reported the situation during that period, and with most of the prints now stored in electronic format and transferred to the National Library.</p>
              <p>The digitised format beats the micro-films, which can be time consuming even when it will show more details.</p>
