The issue of choice should be deliberated separately. However..................LazerLordz......you have never been to CSC am I right? I am afraid I cannot comment any further than this.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I don't think a cold-blooded SAF is the way to go. While we must be concerned about maintaining standards, at no time shall we adopt the idea that a few deaths are acceptable here and there. While it's easy to talk garang and say that more dangerous training is okay if there's a gain in tougness, imagine you were a sibling or parent of somebody who's going in, not of his own accord, into a system that does not really care if he's gonna survive. It's a breeding ground for community chao keng from NS, as well as kicking the PAP way out of power, by which time having NS or not would be a moot point.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hi all,<br><br>This is my first post so if I'm a little "off the mark" please forgive.<br><br>I think we need to differentiate between the (1)Purpose and (2) Practice of the CSC.<br><br>(1) Purpose<br>Having gone through it in the early 90s, I agree with most proponents that it is an essential part of training - especially for units who have to operate in environments that there is a high chance of being outgunned and surrounded. It trains the soldier in survival instinct - to run, hide, escape and evade and a healthy dose of fear.<br><br>This is not something that we can just do without in training without detriment to the quality of our training (which is already not very good). take for example, live firing - dangerous, but we need to do it, because you don't know what its like till u go through it.<br><br>However, I think the purpose of CSC should not be to train heroes who can withstand any tortures in war, come what may. That, God forbid it happens to anyone, is up to you, your conscience, your mental strength and your love for your country men - No amount of training can instill or simulate that.<br><br>(2) Practice<br>In practice, no training can truely simulate reality, nor should we blindly try to make it as close to real as possible all the time. For eg, common sense dictates we shouldn't shoot at each other at live firing, even though the experience is definitely "beneficial". When people go overboard, like in our sad case, tragedies are bound to happen.<br><br>However, the fact that we had a lousy practice in SAF for CSC, does not mean we should discontinue it. As i said in (1) i think it is absolutely neccessary (not easy to say for someone who suffered it before), so instead of just canning things when things go wrong, as is the norm in SAF, we should instead how we can improve the "practice" to attain the "purpose" without having more sorry events. This does not neccessarily mean that the training will get any "softer" or easier on the trainees. It simply means more common sense checks in place (eg, can dunk in water up to a time, but make sure no repeated dunkings) -<br><br>I think if we remember the purpose is to familiarise soldiers with POW, and NOT to train super heroes, then I think we can practice it safely, and still as "painfully" as before.<br><br>And as for heroes, well, I have no illusions about being one... but after CSC, I know what it takes to be one.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Firstly I am in last stretch of reservist, most of which is in Infantry. During active I was instructor at ITD (1985-87).<br><br>There are two kinds of training. To impart skills and to condition. Many so called instructors (NCC, SAF or elsewhere) never understand, which is what.<br><br>You can never 'acquire' tolerance or endurance for something like being a POW (mind you, you cannot 'pretend to be POWs'). Anyone and everyone can be broken under interrogration, only 'how fast' and 'what happens along the way' differs.<br><br>The 'so called' CSC (as I understand from comparative study with SAS E&amp;E, US Ranger and SEAL training) is meant to give trainees a taste of how best to resist the simple forms of abuse and ill-treatment. It does not equate with Rambo type heorics to resist torture or histrionics of "pride and country".<br><br>I think what was lost along the way when the CSC was 'expanded' from those who really could benefited (Ranger training), to all Commandos, to your run of the mill Brigade Recce and Guardsman Scouts, is PURPOSE.<br><br>Why do Guardsman need such exposure? Yes, they are likely to be captured, so is any mothers' son on the frontline (Duh!). Is CSC someone's sick joke gone bad when it was 'extended beyond Ranger Training?<br><br>I remember a time when SAF Ranger selection was the only time we see POW interrgoration (now desguised as CSC). Comparing CSC to SAS, SEAL or US Ranger is 'talking cock'; those courses are 'volunteers only' in an all professional army, CSC has no place for NSF who operate on FLOT not behind enemy lines.<br><br>Why is CSC not practiced with pilots? They are more likely to end up behind enemy lines and have important information in their technical skills. It's because the RASF has realised the limits and practicalities of such training.<br><br>Has it become a course with too many instructors with too much free time and a bit too much of one upmanship that a dunking tank now sits in a courtroom?<br><br>No doubt that the SAF is getting soft (note: 'safety gear' on SOC obstacles!!!) but that is no reason to allow instructors who are misguided to become "course terrors" without any benefit or training merit.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>May also be off track here. I did not go thru' CSC but during trainee days during full time NS, our OC put us through "impromptu" POW treatment training.<br><br>However, he was responsible enough to explain that X% of the trainees WILL BE CAUGHT deliberately near the end of the exercise (in Tekong).  These X % will be subject to a half day POW treatment, which will be observed by the rest. He also explained the rational behind this. All trainees accepted the challenge and were convinced.<br><br>I was one of the lucky/ unlucky (depends on yr perspective) X% who got chosen to "endure".  I was put under a staff SGT who was the lead captor. I remembered being stripped of my shirt, blind folded and forced to kneel for a long period. After about 2 hours, an instructor asked if I wanted a drink. We were taught to cooperate but give little info about ourselves and unit etc... but we were taught to cooperate enough to get a drink or food if captured. So I said "yes", and suddenly a cup of tea was thrown in my face. Usual taunting started, the instructor saying something like ... "you want your tea... you got it ... in your face... hahahah...." Anyway, most the "torture" was verbal abuse, altho' one of the instructors tried to put some large red ants on my body.<br><br>Lesson learnt?... well if you are really captured, you will face worse treatment. So if you can't take basic POW / E&amp;E training, then hope you don't get captured by the enemy. But it was good to get a small insight into captive POW treatment. It is an important part of our training.</div>
