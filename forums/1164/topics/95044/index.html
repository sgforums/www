            <div class='col-md body'>Well, since you put it that way, are you trying to say that the value of a personal conscious, choice to join the special forces is no different than mere conscription.The crux of this issue here is not how well we conduct an escape and evasion course, but rather the inherent limits we face in conducting it due to certain political and socio-economic factors.No doubt the army is easily paralysed by political decisions, but do we have a choice?No.So, it's better to think of a better alternative rather than blaming the parents for having their entitled moral authority when their own flesh and blood is concerned.Too much concentration of State authority is dangerous and can undermime the natural influence a family has over her progeny.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Bah, POW courses are mostly wayang, even in the so called "tough" armed forces.<br><br>The truth of the matter is, when you are a real POW, you suck thumb have to endure the torture, or else, too bad you're dead. In the end, when you are POW, there's little you can really do about your situtation. POW courses are nice, but affect the outcome little. Broken and whimpering on TV? There's no shame in being scared when you're a POW.<br><br>In the end, tougher soldiers are nice, but the basic requirement of a soldier is to get to the position to project firepower in a controlled manner so as to achieve the victory conditions. There are many ways to achieve this. In the end, you can create a very tough, high attrition rate course to create tough soldiers but in the end the gain in combat effectiveness is marginal and certainly not worth the cost and energy put into training such soldiers.<br><br>As long as a soldier can be basically fit to survive in the field, and do his job, that's about as good as you can get.

            <div class='col-md body'>When war actually breaks out, everyone screws the Geneva Convention lah. Even the US screws it &amp; justifies doing so by saying those are unlawful combatants not POWs. Watever!!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>Point being, if they want to extract info from you, they will not stop at making you carry jerry cans, roll in mud or splash you with a hose. They'd gladly clobber you with a baseball bat or shove a broomstick up your arse. Now how are you gonna train for that? But having said that, I guess having some form of training is better than none at all.<br><br>Some ppl have questioned whether ALL training done by SAF is realistic or not. Well I can't comment on that since I'm only a small fry in the establishment. But think about it from the other point of view. If training is TOO realisitic &amp; casualty figures hit the roof, what's gonna happen?<br><br>Ppl are gonna protest. Parents are gonna make noise. And ultimately they'll have no choice but to soften the training. And IMHO that's what's been happening. I did my BMT in 1996 under 3 BTS &amp; comparing that to today's BMT, I can already see a massive softening.<br><br>I'm not from combat side so I don't know how true this is, but I heard that SAF seldom does live firing. Its mostly blanks &amp; sometimes even "universal rounds" which I feel is the biggest joke of all.<br><br>In some other countries' armed forces, they use live rounds all the time. I read from this SOF website, can't remember if its Philipines or Indonesia though. But over there, its live rounds &amp; explosives all the way &amp; it is considered normal &amp; "acceptable" to have trainees dying as part of their training.<br><br>What do you think would happen if we implement that here? Oh yes, it'll probably "toughen" us up a lot. But think of the backlash from the public esp the parents.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>To those who are against the idea of CSC, or who are ignorant of the process (ie, never went through it).<br><br>Yes, you do have a choice. But to a certain extent, and its not an easy choice to make. But I don't think it is wise for anyone to reveal it here. Those here who have gone through it should appreciate the secrecy of the entire process. So please, don't shame your parent units.<br><br>As for those who went through it and never found a good reason to support it's continued existence: You will probably not be sent on an important mission. As I have read in the papers in the forum from one of the writers (he went through it twice, voluntarily); the whole idea of CSC is to not just inform the soldiers of the common sense that one does not want to be caught, it is to DRILL it into their heads. Training, is about drilling. It is to prepare the soldiers to make the right decisions, and to let them rehearse their roles as POWs.<br><br>Disclaimer? Here's what I think. Declaring that you are not someone's blood brother doesn't put one in a position to undermine the decision of that person's parents. In fact it would put one in a position that discourages one to do that.<br><br>The officer died as a result of very bad judgement on the part of the trainers and the overall miscommunication through the ranks regarding training procedures. That is all I understand of it. If one were to discredit the value of CSC, it would not be unimagineable that the next thing on the list of suggestions would be the total exemption of military training in NS, which is happening right here.</div>
