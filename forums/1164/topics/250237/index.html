            <div class='col-md body'>Each nation has only a limited amount of GDP. Of which this GDP, can used for either military goods(guns) or civilians products(butter). Personally, look at history(inter-war period)and the disastrous consequences that followed I haven't really been supportive a budget that over-emphasizes social welfare at the expense of military. At the same time, there are others such as socialists,who believe spending for civilian purposes such as health-care and education should precedence of military spending. What would your opinion be?</div>

The right to bare arms has nothing to do with Arm trade.<br><br>There are lobby on both side to and for arms.  Its implication for this amendment came from the experience guard against british imperialist. During the time of this amendment the United States does not have a regular arm.<br><br>Remember until now all marines are volunteers to be a marine.<br><br>The implcation of this amendment is the final defence within the united States in case there is a  Evil power that sit in the government or a foreign invasion into the United States. Its citizen and either rise up and over throw the government just like what they did to the Brit or protect the home and family.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Was reading this article in the ST about some ex-American resident who supposed to solution to all gun crimes was to disarm the whole of American soceity and the military as well!<br><br>A nice solution, but I wonder how it can pratically be applied in American without giving up much of what they are about.<br><br>Passing laws just won't cut it given the current state of things, sure you'll remove the guns from the law-abiding people and cut down on the number of accidential and heat-of-the-moment-homocide deaths but that still leaves out the outlaws who would hold onto their weapons at most costs.<br><br>To remove the weapons from these dudes, you would have to take it by force, or impose extremely harsh firearm laws ala. Singapore where life terms and death penalties are imposed for firearms.<br><br>This of course, would be contary to most Americans.<br><br>And of course, the take the guns from outlaws and to keep it that way require considerable firepower, as well as curtailing a lot of the freedoms that the Americans like so much.<br><br>So yeah, it'll be a great world where everybody would think like that dude and all disarm and hate guns... but this simply isn't our world.<br><br>Oddly enough, other countries have gun ownership but their gun deaths are far lower then America if you account for all the population and percentage of gun ownership. So does the fault lie with guns or the mentality of the people who own them?<br><br>I don't know, but if I ever lived in America I would get a gun, simply because if you are forced to defend yourself most likely it would be from a gun. Better to be alive then to have pacifist ideas that can't defend what matters to you.</div>
