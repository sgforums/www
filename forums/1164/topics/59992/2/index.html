The Mindef did sent a bunch of soldiers consisting of NSmen and Regulars to Timor Leste. They went there , survive it and did us proud. Eventhough situation in Iraq will be alittle bit more drastic than wat we had experienced in Timor , the basic requirement of a soldier to be ready for the call of duty is still expected.<br><br>Wat are soldiers for? Soldiers are essiential chess seeds to defend , secure and fulfil a country's interest. If sending troops to Iraq is Singapore's interest ( be it political or wat so ever ) , then isnt it rightful to send in Nsmen together with regulars to that mission?<br><br>In my own humble opinion , sending our soldiers to a foreign country to do humanity a favour cant be a 'suka' affair. If we aint ready to bear the pain sending our loved ones to do the righteous cause for national pride, how are we able to cope with the grief when we send our troops to war? If the country do not have the right to send any of her personnel to fulfil her interest , then refering Nsmen as soldiers is really questionable?<br><br>Those soldiers going to Iraq will be train with the necessary skill and be equipped with the necessary gadget . Eventhough those equipment aint heaven's mandate for guaranteed survival , it is the furthest SAF can go to ensure that our soldiers go and return back. Keeping our NSmen from the call for action jus to ensure that they are still 'hopping and alive' cant be optimum.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Dr Goh Keng Swee's preamble when introducing the NS Bill in Parliament in 1967 stated:<br><br>"I consider it to be wrong to believe that there is nothing we can or should do about defending ourselves, even though we cannot achieve complete invulnerability by our unaided efforts.".<br><br>This, I believe, aptly sums up the intent of introducing national service when the Act was passed in 1967.  The act, and by extension NS itself, was introduced with the express purpose of defending Singapore.  Note that unlike the Army or People's Defence Force Acts of 1965, this pertains directly to conscription, and I think it is quite clear that conscription was introduced in Singapore with the intent of defence of Singaporean territory, not for overseas deployments.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>By 1969, <strong>88 percent</strong> of American infantry riflemen in Vietnam were conscripts (or in their parlance, draftees)!  I don't count that as anything resembling a fully volunteer force.  Please check your facts - we're talking about 648,500 men here, not a handful of poor sods.<br><br>Also, what's your understanding of the National Guard?  First, you say "a fully volenteer force apart from the National guard", and then agree that the NG is voluntary.<br><br>In anycase, arguing about proportions of conscripts and volunteers is a red herring here.

First, you say "a fully volenteer force apart from the National guard", and then agree that the NG is voluntary.[/b]</blockquote>Yes 88 percent were conscript but at that time the US already move away from the ww1-ww2 mindset of a small home defence like the national guard.They had a fully volunteer armed forces for use outside their country and a national guard.However like all countries in time of war they draft to heavily increase manpower.When needed so the US army wasnt really like Singapore.The closes you can get is Israel,Taiwan,Germany...etc etc Where by they like the US have a fully volunteer regular army but still have a national service soldier who has more much more training then the US conscripts.Anyway this whole point is moot since more often then not the NSF soldier world wide never get sent out.The US conscripts do not count they were given the bare minimum of training.Less then 1 year infact.I think it was something like 3 months or something.<br>The NG now is fully volunteer force made of of laid off soldiers or some people that like soldiering.They are in fact the US reserve units.So currently they are like a volunteer NS...same training and stuff.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hmm...apprenetly the National Guards and Army reserves are different.And they play different roles.The army reserves provides support and logistics while the National guard is used to provide extra comabt personal in time of need without drafting or having too big a force like our NSF  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy">  But it is volunteer</div>
