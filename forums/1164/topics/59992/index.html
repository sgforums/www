They did face fightings during their stay in Somalia however those fightings that they encounter cant account to how well is their armed force as a whole.<br><br>I will say that all their self-cheering and praising on their experiences are all craps.

Do u wanna follow that trend?</div></blockquote>Well said , a few skimish in Somalia does not constitute them as a effective fighting force in large scale warfare. As the matter of fact, there was a article written by a security analyst in the 90s said that the SAF is the most potent &amp; effective fighting force in a large scale conventional warfare in SEA. Let me explain further  by going thru the history of SAF formation &amp; training as compare with the MAF.<br><br><span style="color: blue;">In the late 60s &amp; 70s , SAF was forming various arms formation &amp; developing  expertise with layered air defence, long range arty &amp; a potent armour units, all the pieces for a large scale conventional warfare.<br><br>Whereas, the MAF &amp; all the regional armed forces were concentrating on only on counter-insurgency operation, The MAF at this moment did not develop a effective air defence(No AA missiles &amp; radar), no long range arty &amp; certainly no tanks.</span><br><br><span style="color: darkblue;">During the 80s, SAF started to train all the formations to fight effectively in a combined arms exercises in the Starlight project where they have yearly Bde to Div scale exercises. These exercises prepared the SAF to operate &amp; fight effectively in large scale conventional warfare in term of logistic support, deployment &amp; develop the synergy effective of large scale combined arms operation.<br><br>At this time, the communist threat in MY was waning but the MAF still did not have all the pieces for a effective combined arms operation.The most they have some training in combined arms operation in a very small scale as compare with the SAF.</span><br><br><span style="color: blue;">During the 90s the SAF started to form combined arms Div instead of the previous separate command for all the other arms. This created more synergy and much more effective force. At this time the SAF also developing RMA with better C4ISR so that the SAF is even more a potent force as compare with the rest in the region.They are begining to develop a Rapid deployment forces.<br><br>This time , MY had great plan to modernise the MAF so to develop a effective combined arms but due to budget constraint &amp; the currency crisis ,the modernisation programmes did not materialise especially for the army. Therefore the MAF has not develop a combined arms capability in a large scale ,the most a few isolated Bde level exercises.They have plans to develop a rapid deployment forces &amp; a combined armed Bde but the asset are not there yet.</span><br><br><span style="color: indigo;">By now ,the SAF has not only fully developed the Rapid deployment force, it is also the most advance in the region in term of RMA. It is most developed armed forces in term of capability and the most well trained in term of large scale combined arms operation in Bde &amp; Div level with two decades of constant exercises.No other forces in the region can boost that. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"><br><br>The MAF has just getting some of the pieces for a effective combined arms operations. For example better air defences, long range arty etc. But even with all the pieces together, they still lack of the expertise in term large scale combined arms operation if they dun have a regular large scale exercises to develop it.</span><br><br>Therefore in conclusion, one to one in large scale conventional warfare, the MAF is way behind the SAF. And with the most develop in RMA as compare to them, it tipped the scale  even more. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz"></div>
