I didn't participate cos I was both skeptical and scared at the same time.<br><br>After that night, let's just say that I was no longer skeptical when it came to Ouija boards.

So can't remember which barrack etc.<br><br>Around 7pm, 3 chaps decide to play Ouija board game. There was a square folding table and four chairs in the cnetre of the small 10-men barrack room with double beds. On a piece of excercise book paper were written the alphabets A-Z, the numbers 1-0, and the words, "YES" and "NO". And most importantly, a circle marked "HOME". All in English.<br><br>A 50-cent coin was used for them to place their index fingers on, lightly. But you're not supposed to take your finger away from the coin or the spirit will haunt you. The start point was the circle marked "HOME".<br><br>Of the 3 chaps playing - one was a real joker/mishchievious type. Another one, the one who suggested the game, knew about these spirit things and he was the one who "called" the spirit to the board. Another, is just a very "pai kiah" type.<br><br>I was skeptical, curious and scared at the same time so I just watched.<br><br>The coin started moving, slowly at first, and then very actively afterwards.<br><br>They all asked question like who the spirit is. And then they asked questions about themselves. Apparently, the "spirit" is a young female. It answered all questions by moving from alphabet to alphabet or number to number or simply "YES" or "NO".<br><br>Time for night snack at 9pm, they asked the spirit to go "HOME". The coin moved in circles, almost seeming reluctant. And then after a while, it stopped in the "HOME" circle.<br><br>They lifted their fingers off and we all went for canteen break.<br><br>All the time I was thinking: What a load of rubbish. It must be the mischievious fellow pushing the coin, or the fellow who called the spirit. The pai kiah, though tough, was just being led along. I got it all figured out though I kept my views to myself.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>...continued.<br><br>After nightsnack at about 11pm, the 3 guys decide to play the Ouija board again.<br><br>I thought these guys have not had enough of fooling themselves.<br><br>But I again accompanied them, again occupying the fourth chair on the sqaure table.<br><br>This time, the coin moves very, very slowly, if at all. So I thought the joker pushing the coin has now changed tactics.<br><br>Soon, it was time for lights out a 12mn. The other non-participants have all gone to bed. I turned off all the bunk lights though the corridor lights came in.<br><br>The coin was still crawling very slowly and it wasn't answering any questions. I was thinking, finally, a spirit that doesn't understand English.<br><br>Their repeated calls for the spirit to go "HOME" was similarly ignored and the coin just wandered aimlessly along the paper.<br><br>Soon it was 1am. It has become unbelievably cold for the 4 of us. I turned off all the ceiling fans. It was still cold, they requested blankets and I wrapped one around each of them including myself. It was more a chill than cold, hard to describe now.<br><br>They were all dead tired but still afraid to lift their fingers off the coin as it crawled slowly all over the paper except onto the "HOME" circle.<br><br>By 3am, I cannot tahan and went to bed. The 3 chaps were very quiet, very tired and the pai kiah had dark rings under his eyes.<br><br>Next morning, they told me that finally the spirit went "HOME" at around 4am. The pai kiah said he saw a little kid under one of the beds but was too scared to say anything at that time.<br><br>So is the Ouija board thing real or was one of the chaps pushing it? If that chap was trying to fool the other 2 guys, I don't think he would have persisted until 4am. Haing a finger on a coin for over 4 hours is a very tiring thing to do. And the cold chill was hard to explain for Singapore's climate.<br><br>I've had worse experiences at another camp, but this is the Seletar Camp experience. You can't really say the Camp was haunted, these guys invited it upon themselves.</div>
