Once the USSR collapsed, there was no longer any organ ised enemy of millions to fight, and we weren't going to see T-72s rolling across the German plains.  While there was nothing wrong with downsizing per se, the US military did need to retool to fight a different kind of war, and they failed to do that.  The mess in Somalia highlighted that need, but the military was slow to adapt.  To put it simply, would the US military in 1989 be equipped to fight the current war in Iraq by virtue of its size?<br><br>Clinton, being a Democrat, focussed more on domestic issues, and say what you like of him, he handled the ecenomy well and did a good job with national debt (okay, maybe you could argue that Sir Alan was a big part of that as well, but Clinton was at the wheel).  That's not something that Michael Moore harps on about in his rabid rantings.<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by John Ching:</div><div class="quote_body">CIA had no resources in areas that matter most is because when Bill Clinton was President, CIA resources were diverted to focus on economic espionage thats why it had to rely on the Brits intel to sell its war on Iraq.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mad.gif" alt="Mad" title="Mad"> </div></blockquote>That's inaccurate.  The CIA formed a Bin Laden desk in 1996, under Clinton's instructions.  This desk worked constantly to get Bin Laden, planning missile strikes and a capture operation in conjunction with Afghan dissident groups.  The problem was Pakistan, which sympathised with the Taliban government and got in the way of a number of those operations.  Also, because of the nuclear testing situation between India and Pakistan, the US government could not lean on the Pakistanis too hard.<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by John Ching:</div><div class="quote_body">43rd President GWB, as you've name him, didn't even blame Clinton &amp; his administration for the mess instead he accepted the mess &amp; set about working on it.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_neutral.gif" alt="Neutral" title="Neutral"> </div></blockquote>Aw, come on.

GHW Bush's plan was that the military be down size over the next few years in a slow &amp; controlled manner.  Clinton's admin tool power &amp; downsize the military like they were throwing out old furnitures.  As it is public knowledge, so you should know, that Clinton never liked anything to do with the military.  Somolia was not the only mistake, what about Bosnia? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_eek.gif" alt="Shocked" title="Shocked"><br><br>Its true Clinton handled the economy well but don't mistake that for domestic issues, Wilco- Texas,  Oklahoma's bombing, et cetra.  In fact, domestic terrorism was at an all time high during Clinton's administration.<br><br>The so-called "CIA's Bin Ladin desk" was just a front thats all.  The focus for the CIA had shifted greatly to economic issues because Clinton don't like to hear words like danger, kill, eliminate, war, military, et cetra.  Time &amp; again plans to send U.S SpecOps to get OBL or others were rejected by Clinton.  In fact, currently in Hague, Slobodan Milosevic, former Yugoslavia ex-leader, could've been captured by U.S SpecOps but Clinton pressured Blair to send his SAS to do the job.<br>If CIA during Clinton's admin was focus on serious issues, India &amp; Pakistan would never have completed their nuke programe &amp; for that matter, neither would Iran.  But CIA knew nothing about it because they were working to please Clinton's agenda.<br>Clinton tried to do serious work, with his pants-up, during the last days of his Presidency by trying to settle the Israel &amp; Palestin issue.  We all know where that has ended, the start of the long conflict between Israel &amp; Palestin.</div>

From that 1st day as President till Sep 11, 2001, everywhere you turn you'll be able to hear a joke about Bush.  How he spoke, how he walks, et cetra.  Has anyone made a joke about Singapore's Prime Minister Lee Hsien Long since he took office or the Indonesian President?<br><br>See the good &amp; the bad about America is the "FREEDOM" to this &amp; that.

GHW Bush's plan was that the military be down size over the next few years in a slow &amp; controlled manner.  Clinton's admin tool power &amp; downsize the military like they were throwing out old furnitures.  As it is public knowledge, so you should know, that Clinton never liked anything to do with the military.  Somolia was not the only mistake, what about Bosnia? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_eek.gif" alt="Shocked" title="Shocked"><br><br>Its true Clinton handled the economy well but don't mistake that for domestic issues, Wilco- Texas,  Oklahoma's bombing, et cetra.  In fact, domestic terrorism was at an all time high during Clinton's administration.</div></blockquote>Yes, I think it's public knowledge to the world that Slick Wille skipped the draft, dropped his pants and didn't inhale.  I'm not his biggest fan either, but if we're trying to understand the current situation, those are red herrings.<br><br>I'd say that a more crucial factor was the intelligence community's high degree of reliance on Sigint instead of Humint, which is a carry-over from the Cold War days.  Al Qaeda's finances were channeled through hawala, and funds were also illicitly funneled from various unrelated sources.  No amount of electronic surveillance could have tracked any of that, and we're talking about US$30 million a year.  You can't dismantle a Cold-War intelligence machine and retool a new one overnight, and which president is running the show isn't going to make a whole lot of difference.<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by John Ching:</div><div class="quote_body">The so-called "CIA's Bin Ladin desk" was just a front thats all.  The focus for the CIA had shifted greatly to economic issues because Clinton don't like to hear words like danger, kill, eliminate, war, military, et cetra.  Time &amp; again plans to send U.S SpecOps to get OBL or others were rejected by Clinton.  In fact, currently in Hague, Slobodan Milosevic, former Yugoslavia ex-leader, could've been captured by U.S SpecOps but Clinton pressured Blair to send his SAS to do the job.<br>If CIA during Clinton's admin was focus on serious issues, India &amp; Pakistan would never have completed their nuke programe &amp; for that matter, neither would Iran.  But CIA knew nothing about it because they were working to please Clinton's agenda.</div></blockquote>Not quite right - the cancellations were mainly the work of Richard Clarke (a Republican), Sandy Berger and George Tenet.  Few, if any, of those decisions reached the Oval Office.<br><br>As for the India-Pakistan issue, India had built a nuclear weapon and tested it by 1974, and Pakistan had enough fissile material for a weapon by 1986.  Your point about the CIA being serious during the Clinton administration therefore does not hold.<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by John Ching:</div><div class="quote_body">Clinton tried to do serious work, with his pants-up, during the last days of his Presidency by trying to settle the Israel &amp; Palestin issue.

If Yitzhak Rabin had not been assasinated (by an Israeli) in 1996, leaving Netanyahu and Sharon in charge, the peace process would have been along a lot further than it is now.<br><br>Besides, if you want to look at the short version of Israel and Palestine, you would have to go back to 1967, when Israel took the West Bank and Gaza Strip (we all have Egypt and Syria to thank for that mess).  You could also go back to 1948, when the state of Israel was fromed at Palestine's expense.  In 1945, when the Stern Gang was carrying out terrorist activities to push for a Zionist state, Clinton was little more than an itch in his daddy's crotch.  Sure, he couldn't sort out the mess, but neither could anybody in the last 56 years.</div>

As it is, stopping OBL's inheritance of $300 million from the old man, and later the $1 million per year stipend, took enough doing.

I disagree with you about Albright's role in shelving operations.  Perhaps it was Janet Reno's objection to the operations on constitutional grounds you were thinking about?<br><br>Second, check your maps.  A cruise missile strike would have to overfly Pakistan to hit OBL.  Given Pakistan's sympathy towards the Taliban government during the late 90's, and the need to assure the Pakistanis that the missile over their heads was not of Indian origin, there was never much chance of a missile landing on OBL's doorstep without warning.
