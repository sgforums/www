Compared to the KGB, CIA during those days could not claim credit for any successful wet ops because they were never able to get it right.  It wasn't like the guys from OSS, now those guys had good score during WW II.  True, most of them stay on to work in the CIA but new rules came into effect &amp; so things had to be done differently then during the WW II.<br><br>Did they really breath a sign of relief when Clinton signed that order? I wouldn't know but I do know that they stopped doing wet works right after their failure to kill Castro &amp; then the Bay of Pig incident.  Anyway, the order does not just concern assasination ops but other ops as well.  An example would be during Clinton admin, OBL was to be captured &amp; not killed on sight.  Today that order has changed to "capture or kill".<br><br>Did JR really felt any remose about the Waco incident?  Its debatable but in terms of military operation getting the GO, her part of the plan as AG is to ensure that every legal means are met &amp; that the President is shield from any prosecution as a result of any military ops.  Because in the end, she's not the CIC, its Clinton.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_evil.gif" alt="Evil or Very Mad" title="Evil or Very Mad"><br><br>By the way, you mentioned that Clinton ever asked the current Pakistan President to go after OBL, right?  Well, the Pakistab President must have knew that Clinton was not serious about the request.  Because compared to the current request by Bush, results seems to show he took Bush's words more seriously.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"></div>

From what I've read so far, the FBI has yet to specify what kind of laser tool was used except that it can be bought of the rack in most store.

My Casio strap broke eventually after about 2 years NS (I found it after 6 months in NS) and about one year into university. The strap costs probably 30% of the watch price. But battery somehow did not need replacement. Fortunately had a patient girlfriend during uni days who fabricated a new strap from coloured shoe-laces and velcro ! Anyway, that's another story....<br><br>But the point is after spending thousands on a Rolex, Omega , Tag, breitling or some expensive sports watch, I am sad when it gets badly scratched. Somehow not worth it. Maybe for us reservists, when our pay is much more compared to a watch, it may be OK. But for a full time NS guy , earning at most $900, the Rolex, Omega, etc  is a lot of money.<br>Plus you get unnecessary attention (somtimes negative) from your peers or seniors.<br></div>

Other chronos have pusher rods that go through the case to activate the chrono mechanism, but the M1 uses a set of magnetic actuators instead.
