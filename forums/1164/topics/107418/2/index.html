There are reasons for which Bush won't fire Rumsfeld, 1st being the fact that by firing Rumsfeld, Bush would be indirectly admitting that the war in Iraq has been wrong &amp; this would enable others, including other world leaders, to undermine future policies.<br>2nd, troops morale would also indirectly be affected by it even though some soldiers might not agree with Rumsfeld, seeing him go would cause their morale to drop further.<br>3rdly, who hasn't made a mistake in life?  Its how that person learns from his mistake &amp; make up for it.  Bush allowing Rumsfeld to stay on shows that he has faith that Rumsfeld will learn from the mistakes &amp; do a better job.  It also shows that he is a Commander in chief who stands by his men.<br><br>of course, there are other reasons but I think the above 3 are the more important reasons for Bush decision to retain Rumsfeld.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_neutral.gif" alt="Neutral" title="Neutral"></div>
