            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote>Sound like i-SHOT might be creating employment opportunity in Sg</blockquote>Hotspotter, we're gonna start on a small scale as usual. Stateside we do a fair share of business but I personally wouldn't get a good handle on the potential for Singapore until we've gotten some exposure. Who knows, this could be sizeable. FYI, besides our SERT stuff we'll also be representing a small number of US companies, both products AND trainers &amp; consultants. Other than the lights you see above, we'll also be marketing the following:<br><br>SIGTAC - the new tactical apparel line from SIG SAUER (I'm a US dealer right now and we helped them design the initial line)<br><br>SIDEARMOR - holsters and other tactical kydex<br><br>MIL-COMM - TW25 lubricant is almost the standard for the US SOF<br><br>MPro 7 - Our choice of gun cleaners (hardly any smell)<br><br>BLUE GUNS - those blue inert ones for training<br><br>Hopefully, VALDADA OPTICS and SPEC OPS BRAND down the road.<br><br><blockquote>Ah great..! Have always been wondering what Brad looks like. haha. i don't see you at the forums over there. not many of us here hang out at the lf forum. from what i know, it's only me and temujin. </blockquote>Palmerised, I usually scope the forum out but I usually don't participate. Most are gear junkies with a few exception. I'm usually with the run and gun crowd. We host, participate and compete in IDPA, shotgun and 3-gun matches along the Mid-Atlantic and I rarely see anyone from the LF forum at any of these events.  You'll easily find me on GlockTalk, SIGForum, 1911Forum, The High Road, Brian Enos, etc.<br><br>Gotta go...that time of the night where I spend some minutes with dry fire practice <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>

I only sell civilian stuff stateside, elsewhere it's predominantly LE or military. The Malaysian PASKAL units are running our new tactical carbine cases.

Unless there's interest among Singaporeans to get a feel for the high speed stuff (at the Shooting Center) or somewhere close, the US trainers and consultants are primarily for LE and military. We hope to have the office in Singapore but will target the region with Singapore's permission.<br><br>The company currently owns a shooting team for the IDPA (www.idpa.com) circuit here in the US and we are one of the major sponsors for most of the events. Last weekend was the Smith &amp; Wesson Winter Championships and every single shooter that competed got one of my bags; that's how involved we are over here. And yes, S&amp;W is also a good client of ours. The second shooter on the Team won 1st CDP Master; 10 seconds behind the World Champion, Ernest Langdon. These guys are freaking mad; shooting upwards of 40K rounds a year.<br><br>Me?
