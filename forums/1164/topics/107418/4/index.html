It exists and operates outside of, or parallel to 'traditional' banking or financial channels. It was developed in India, before the introduction of western banking practices, and is currently a major remittance system used around the world. It is but one of several such systems; another well known example is the 'chop', 'chit' or 'flying money' system indigenous to China, and also, used around the world. These systems are often referred to as 'underground banking'; this term is not always correct, as they often operate in the open with complete legitimacy, and these services are often heavily and effectively advertised.<br><br>The components of hawala that distinguish it from other remittance systems are trust and the extensive use of connections such as family relationships or regional affiliations. Unlike traditional banking or even the 'chop' system, hawala makes minimal (often no) use of any sort of negotiable instrument. Transfers of money take place based on communications between members of a network of hawaladars, or hawala dealers.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>So with regards to your question as to whether its possible to trace U.S $30mil, as long as its a network of whatever form, dedicated FBI agents would know how to find it though it would take time.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br><br>Well, its likely because of the clause in the "no assasination" order that stopped SpecOps from being deployed, Clinton administration don't want to have to explain on CNN how a capture op turn into a hit job &amp; besides he don't trust a soldier's ability to keep his finger out of the trigger.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>To obtain peace between the Israelis &amp; the Palestinians, the plan has to be accepted by both parties &amp; its own people.

Now before you jump your guns on Reagan'administration, remember he was focusing on ending the cold war with a country that had just as many nuke warhead as the U.S &amp; were not the least concern if their missile were accurate or not so long as it hit the U.S.  Honestly, Clinton was made aware of the programe when he took office but couldn't be bother about it until India test fired the accurate Prithvi missile.  In any case, all he did then was go to the U.N &amp; gave a wonderfull speech about how disappointed he was with India &amp; hoped that India would be wise enough to cancel their nuke programe so that the world can be a better place.

That effectively put the US on a war footing, and in such times, an extraordinary amount of money gets released, especially since it would be political suicide for anyone to oppose it.  Besides, everybody knows that you donÂ’t get that kind of money by sweet-talking Â– you get it by kicking it out of someone when heÂ’s down.<br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by John Ching:</div><div class="quote_body">I don't believed that I claimed that tracing of money was going to be easy &amp; quick but rather that it would take time.

They had a hard enough time treying to trace the funds, and the money being moved in small denominations and non-US currency didn't help.<br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by John Ching:</div><div class="quote_body">With regards to the oppotunity to capture OBL by SpecOps, there were actually 2 occasion that was possible. 1 was before the bombing of the U.S embassy in Kenya &amp; the other was on the day they decided to use Tomak hawk missile to blow up an empty camp from which OBL had left the place a couple of hours earlier.

In 1998 the Principals Committee gave the go-ahead for an operation to use Afghan tribals to capture OBL.  On May 29, 1998, either Tenet or Pravitt killed the mission.  On August 20, 1998, the US Navy fired Tomahawks at suspected al Qaeda sites, but did not get Bin Laden.  On December 21, 1998, the US Navy was preparing to hit OBL at the Haji habash house in Kandahar, but he had flown the coop.  On February 12, 1999, the US military once again missed a chance for a cruise missile strike against OBL in the Sheikh Ali camp near Kandahar, and again in May 1999 in various locations in Kandahar.<br><br>Effectively, Spec Ops boys were not put on the ground due to military bureaucracy.  Such a mission would have put Spec Ops as a supported command, instead of the supporting command as listed in the US military's ORBAT.  Despite arguments by officers such as General Peter Schoomaker, Spec Ops was not allowed to act as a supported command.<br><br>There you go - you're wrong. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by John Ching:</div><div class="quote_body">Who's the current President of Egypt?  Does that answer your question as to who place Egypt where it is today?  Of course, feel free to argue on about it.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"> </div></blockquote>Oh, so you're saying that Hosni Mubarak is responsible for Egypt's no longer being in chaoots with Syria, Iraq and other Mideast countries in rolling tanks over Israel's border?

Now before you jump your guns on Reagan'administration, remember he was focusing on ending the cold war with a country that had just as many nuke warhead as the U.S &amp; were not the least concern if their missile were accurate or not so long as it hit the U.S.  Honestly, Clinton was made aware of the programe when he took office but couldn't be bother about it until India test fired the accurate Prithvi missile.  In any case, all he did then was go to the U.N &amp; gave a wonderfull speech about how disappointed he was with India &amp; hoped that India would be wise enough to cancel their nuke programe so that the world can be a better place.  Not even an embargo was proposed.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"> </div></blockquote>Now before you jump your guns, the Clinton administration was trying to sort out the mess left behind by Reaganomics, a shifting political stage thanks to the Soviet Union's collapse, Saddam's shenanigans, the first WTC bombing, plus a growing domestic terrorist threat thanks to a certain Mr McVeigh (may he rot in hell) and a pain-in-the-butt-Republican-majority congress.<br><br>Cuts both ways - have you ever seen an administration that didn't have its hands full?  Common sense states that an accurate Prithvi would have been easier to prevent if there wasn't a Prithvi in the first place. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz"><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by John Ching:</div><div class="quote_body"> Hopefully the debate won't end up like a girlie match.  </div></blockquote>Nah, weÂ’re going toe-to-toe so far without personal insults, and IÂ’m actually having a good time.

The nature of the ops in Afghanistan would have required Spec Ops Command to act as a supported, not supporting, force, and the military structure was too inflexible to accommodate for that.

Amongst the things that did do the US in were the unsuitability of the military and intelligence structures for this kind of war, and a lack of interdepartmental cooperation in gathering and analysing terrorism data, especially from the FBI.  They kept a lot of information to themselves because they feared it would interfere with any legal proceedings that could be brought against arrested terrorists.  Guess they missed the forest for the trees.<br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by John Ching:</div><div class="quote_body">If you chose to associate those genius at MIT to be related to the intelligence community?
