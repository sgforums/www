Not too sure if they hired some tom dick or harry, but the salesmen are a pretty close knitted bunch...one of the staff there ( don't noe if he is still ard) was the 1st NSF commando leader who passed Ranger training couple of yrs back (correct me if  i am wrong) they are quite sincere with their sales and after sales support..</div>

Back when I was working as a park-ranger, for about 2 months, I carried a maglite &amp; a surefire.  I used the mag when I had to do some pro-long tracking for missing hikers &amp; surefire when I need to brighten areas in a distance.  Since the combine weight of the 2 torch aren't that heavy, it wasn't a problem for me to carry both on my belt.  I must admit that there people who were wonderring why I need 1 torch.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_redface.gif" alt="Embarassed" title="Embarassed"><br><br>So in the end, it really isn't harmful to own at least 1 surefire torch without having ever to use it until that one moonless &amp; dark night comes along.  I own 1 myself, my brother own 6 surefire torch of various models, so I'm not the crazy one.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_twisted.gif" alt="Twisted Evil" title="Twisted Evil"></div>

They help remind the troops that their actions are being watch by the world, how they fight, how they handle prisoners, et cetra plays a great deal to them who calls themselves professionals.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>Honestly, I think Rumsfield is Ooold!  Due to the prisoner abuse case &amp; others, he does come across as being sleazy but the truth is that he is hell-bent on  getting this war started &amp; ended before he sleeps.  So he is doing all he can to ensure that this war will not be like, what everyone likes to compare, the Vietnam war.  And as we can see, its not easy.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br>In a different view, if Rumsfield is appointed as Sec of State, then America would be in deep crap.
