            <div class='col-md body'>apparently the reputation of the Gurkhas is so fearsome that enemies have given up without a fight. I read once that during the Falklands conflict one group of Argentine soldiers gave up without firing a shot once they heard they were up against the gurkhas, which left the gurkhas a little upset, since they were all prepped for a fight....<br><br>Anyways, from what i understand, the gurkhas in singapore are seconded (or 'rented', some say) from the Brits, since the Brits are the only ones who do the selection of gurkhas in Nepal, apparently. I've run into them a few times before in singapore, and they were doing their training (like range) in British camo fatigues. Very fit and serious people, but strangely mild-mannered and pleasant at the same time.</div>

Rifleman Bhanbhagta without waiting for orders dashed forward alone to attack the first foxhole. With two grenades he killed both occupants and without hesitation rushed on to clear three more foxholes single handed with bayonet and grenade. Realizing that a light machine gun now firing on him would hold up not only has own platoon behind him but another approaching from the west, Bhanbhagta for the fifth time advanced alone under heavy enemy fire to knock out this position.<br><br>Doubling forward he leapt on to the roof of the bunker from where, his hand grenades being finished, he flung two smoke and Bhanbhagta promptly killed then both with his Khukuri. Japanese inside the bunker was still firing the gun holding up the advance of the platoon, so Bhanbhagta crawler inside, killed this remaining gunner and captured gun.<br><br>Extract from London Gazette<br>5 June 1945</strong><br><strong>Date and Place of Birth: September 1921<br>Phalbu Village, Nepal,</strong><br><br>This is not only one act of heroism but impressed me the most ,<br>even better than "Rambo" clear 4 foxholes and one bunker with MG singlehandly and constantly underfire by the Japs Wow <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_surprised.gif" alt="Surprised" title="Surprised"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I have seen the Gurkhas being deploy for  abt 2 or 3 weeks ago at suntec. They were carrying shotgun and MP5 submachine gun in their neatly press uniform really smart. I think they basically deploy at the prison ( seen one at changi prison guard tower) and some sensitive place or building. As for their fitness i think the place they come from play a part. ( imagine back in Nepal they have to climb the mountain up down eveyday ).</div>

Right now they are being simply underused as glorified RPs. I know from my pal who's in the police task force that the gurkhas are deployed as 'agressors' during their exercise. I hope one day the SAF will use them in a similar capacity. That will certainly hone the fighting skills of our soldiers. In lancer, we did train against gurkhas attached there</div></blockquote>-----------------------------------------------------------------------------<br><br>Actually the Gurkhas was snd to east timor with the police untec peace keeping to East Timor</div>
