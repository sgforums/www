            <div class='col-md body'>I think its because F-15 can carry heavy payloads. I think somebody said here before that the RSAF wasn't looking for a air-superiority fighter. Rather, it was looking for a fighter that could perform a strike role, thus a plane that could carry a heavy payload would be more suitable.</div>

            </div>
            <div class='col-md body'>IMO, the choice for F15 has both polictical and practical experience.<br><br>In terms of political, it makes sense because we need to get into bed with the Americans, we can make use of their training facilities, instructors, etc.  Imagine you buy Typhoon and where you gonna train?  Its only in US that you can fly your F15 with F16, coordination with our AWS aircraft and perhaps vs Apache, and all the hardware that we might have at the Prairie Training Ground.<br><br>Its crucial that we can formulate battle plans incorporating the different a/c that we have and then actually do it in the training gnd.  I don't think US is gonna let you fly the Typhoon over and base them at the training ground ?  Also, flying the F16s over may not be a good idea as well.<br><br>I am not sure, but I suppose cross-training support staff will be easier to maintain and arm the F16 &amp; F15.   In the sense, weapons can be developed with the two aircarfts in mind / system.<br><br>Lastly as many have pointed out, purchasing the F15 can be a stepping stone to purchasing the future generation aircrafts that may come off the line.<br><br>I think perhaps one of the most crucial reason is its trackrecord.  The F15 is available, its playing, its taken part in combat and it has shot down planes without a single loss.  That is the testament you need to pick the aircraft.  The other planes are not yet flying or not that "well-known".  Without doubt, the F15 is considered old but it is only a stop-gap.  I think RSAF is gonna purchase a newer batch to replace its F5 &amp; early F16s soon.</div>

More &amp; more air forces  are now selecting Typhoon.</div></blockquote>F-15E first flight - 11 Dec 1986<br>One must remember that f-15E look like f-15C but it is a total redesign plane.<br><br>Eurofighter - althought the first flight is 27 March 1994, but was not really that new, it dervied from  Experimental Aircraft Program (EAP) which first flight was Aug 1986 just that agreements and contracts drag on and delay , which make people think it is more recent.<br><br>Rafale first flight - 04 july 1986<br><br>Looking at the data above, all 3 planes are the same generation and technology.  They are equal in a lot of area.<br><br>The reason why singapore choice f-15 sg is the right choice.<br>Singapore have a wide range of high tech weapons, the only plane at the moment capable of carry them is only F-15 sg . Sad to say Rafale &amp; Eurofighter will need some years before they can do so. F-15 also have the superior range and load.<br><br>For those who like eurofighter &amp; rafale, face the fact the ideal of plane able to outturn taking down another plane in dog-fight seem glorious. But they must not forget F-15 can do it also.  But modern warfare already changing, with the new helmet sights and missiles which the plane manubility is not that important, they became more of missile platform carrier.  Nowaday, you are more interest in taking out those planes before they even airborne, so F-15 is the better plane to get the job done.<br><br>Consider also if war happens, the ease of resupply and replace of the planes is in question. If rafale or eurofighter, supply is going to be a huge issues. Where as F-15, supplies is easiler and can be instant taking from US stockpiles.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>For air to ground , F15 SG currently beats Typhoon simply because F15 E/SG was adapted from the original F15 for ground attack  / interdiction. Typhoon was originally conceived as an air to air figher.<br><br>Although F15 E  flew in 1986, its origins are still  based on 1970's technology. The first flight of the F15 must have been in the 70s. Typhoon had a long gestation period before becoming operational due mainly to political reasons, but its technology is at least 1990s( or later )  based.<br><br>For air to air F15SG is outclassed by Typhoon.  As mentioned somewhere else, Typhoon is optimized for BVR.  It has IRST , the most advanced pilot / warplane interface &amp; helmet sight, supercruise, carefree flight controls, +9 g rating at SUPERSONIC speeds &amp; in future Meteor BVR missiles. Which fighter do you want to be in when facing up against a SU30 ;  F15E /SG or Typhoon ?<br><br>Singapore is not Israel which has strong political lobby in USA. Neither do we aspire to be Israeli-like. One shud never assume ANY country will come to our aid in times of crisis. Our  thinking shud be that we only have ourselves to depend on - and that is how the Israelis think - this is what we shud emulate.</div>

However the items highlighted in orange are also present (or equivalent alternatives) in the latest F-15 variants comprising the F-15K and F-15SG. The F-15SG was selected by the RSAF due to its impressive strike capability as well as a still potent air to air capability, especially when equipped with the APG-63(V)3 AESA as well as the latest AIM-9X / AIM-120C AAMs.<br><br>The RSAF could potentially receive a total of up to 80 F-15SGs, depending on the status of the F-35 program. However, in my opinion it would be wise to also order Typhoons for the air superiority / escort roles. These would replace our F-5S/T fleet nicely and any purchase of F-35 fighters could be made in the 2020s when our F-16 fleet wears out. The initial F-35s versions would not be as capable as an evolved Typhoon except in terms of stealth anyway.<br><br></div>

I would like to point out it should be Rafale or Typhoon.<br><br>Strange that Typhoon would be highly rated for BVR missions, considering that Meteor is not even IOC</div>
