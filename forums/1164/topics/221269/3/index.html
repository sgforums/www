I'm not sure if the formidability of the Su-30 is also partly because of the desire of the military-industrial complexes of US and Europe to sell more sophisticated aircraft to their airforces ... the cold war is over, defence spending is way way down and the soviet bear is dismantled ... you'd have to look for more adversaries for those goverments to keep on spending money ...<br><br>maybe aircrafts like the F-16, 15, 18 etc are prefectly fine ... but the margins will be much higher for aircrafts like the raptor, typhoons and such, going more than 100 mil a pop, eh ? ...  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"></div>

Once the airfields are taken out, the enemy SU and MiGs fighters can't take off.<br><br>Should the few enemy fighters on CAP intercept en-route or on return route, the F-15SGs are still equipped with full air-to-air weapons which are not sacrified while on strike configuration.<br><br>And u need to carry heavy lots in order to take out the airfields with minimal re-strikes. And remember that northern countries have a lot more airfields then us. And some of the airfields are really very far away.

The F-16 is not a strike aircraft.  It is a modular aircraft where its role is determined by the type of munitions u slap on. However, its range is limited.  An F-16 without fuel tanks has only 7000lbs of fuel, which translates to 7 mins of afterburner.<br><br>On the other hand, the F-15SGs was made for the Strike role in mind.  And its design stems from the the F-15Ds, which were Air Superiority fighters.  Hence they are still more than capable Air to Air combatant.  Trust me, Strike Eagles won't fall prey to Migs29s or Su27s that easily.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>guys....check F-15 and F-16 history...its original role for F-15 is AIR SUPERIORITY . USAF have AX replacement for F-111 that came out with Mud Hen F-15E (at that time compete with F-16XL), F-16 is meant to be frm day light fighter nw a medium-heavy weight multirole fighter.....<br><br>pls do your research before making any senseless arguements...... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I think I got my info correct leh.  The F-16s role is not longer just "light fighter" already. Its a multirole fighter.  The F-15SG is the mud mover version of the F-15 C/D design.</div>

Its optimized for flying Strike missions and other ground attack sorties such as interdiction.  It however retains the air to air capability of the Eagle.  Its heavier weight with Strike ordnance LIMITS its air to air performance.  However if configured as a Strike Escort, with air to air ordnance, it can out perform the MiG-29 EASILY in the BVR arena.<br><br>Given the AIM-9X capability, the agility of the aircraft has become a lesser issue.  The missile will always be more capable in manuevers than the aircraft, so the Strike Eagle does not need to OUT turn the Fulcrum to shoot it down.<br><br>The MiG-29s "legendary" manueverability is overrated.  It can only manuever like that at lower altitudes and lower airspeeds, mainly &lt;350kts.  That means nothing in BVR, and much lesser in WVR given helmet targeting systems and off boresight missiles.  So what if the MiG can make 9gs @ &lt;350 kts?  Its a slower target thats all.<br><br>New systems like Helmet targeting systems and Off boresight missiles changes the approach WVR fight.  Instead of getting into turning fights, trying to out manuever each other, pilots would be trying to get into launch envelops, and leaving it in a hurry, aka boom and zoom. They are not gonna wait around in side the enemy's launch envelop and wait to get shot.</div>
