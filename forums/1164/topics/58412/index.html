In Singapore 1) we have to convince alot of people , go through alot of red-tapes and then evaluate hell long for something new but extremely vital for our armed force. Take the NGF for that example. 2) Some wanted purchases had been selected long ago but some big shots find that it will onli be purchased when the time is right. Take the Apache for example. 3) Some purchases had been identified but some big shots will like it to be indigenously made. The process of DIY is long and expensive. Take the Bionix for example.<br><br>Malaysia style is simply buying anything that they find it worth and affordable.  They will not care whelther is it political sensitive. They dun even care whelther can they support it in the long run. They are practically playing a walk one step , look one step theory with a dream in mind.<br><br>Anyway the main reason y malaysia are having more purchases than Singapore now is because  they are trying to catch up with us , not the opposite. Singapore can sit down and evaluate for a good plateform carefully . After the deal is strike , malaysia will still have to run another lap to catch up with us. In short , they will most likely be behind us.</div>
