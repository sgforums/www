              gees, dun wanna turn this thread into a warzone. Su-30s may or may not be a threat to us, we dun really know as their full capacity/strength is not in yet. but how it might AFFECT Rsaf/spore ?
              maybe we can discuss on how SU-30s vs our own F16/incomin f-15?

              <p>Jfoogph, modern air warfare is not as simple as a single platform vs single platform comparison.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>What you are suggesting is RMAF vs RSAF.  That pits their doctrine, training, and integrated capabilities against ours.  Su-30s on their own, can do little against an IADS that contain some of the best combat aircraft, C3I and Air Defense systems. </p>

              <p>  Chill out Delta,</p>
              <p>This guy's not trolling so far.  Besides, I just made a point that u can't really compare platform to platform.  Especially in the context of whether the Sukhoi 30MKM poses a threat to ASEAN.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>No single platform is capable of taking down an entire IADS on its own.</p>

              <p>To be frank, any form of comparison will bring in references to nations which own them; overt or otherwise. Just lock it if the thread goes out of hand. Otherwise, the forum will be very dead.</p>
              <p>But i agree in keeping a watch on trolls who are covertly coming up with ridiculous posts to infuriate other posters. Especially those who say they are Singaporeans but who are patently and clearly are`nt.</p>

              <p>Anyway, the SU-30 MKM is no threat. The F15sg are more than a match for them. What more if you consider the entire damn RSAF with all thier equipment.</p>
              <p>If you want to compare the equipment(individually or holistically) to other forces, we should look towards Australia, Norway, Taiwan, South Korea, etc. No point comparing with Malaysia. They are in a different league. Also, it will be less emotional for some Singaporeans.</p>
