              <p>The Indians are very close to the Israelis and us. The Indians have had a long list of issues with the Sukhois. Took them some time to work things out. They(RMAF) would not even have the competency to do it themselves. Otherwise, they would have done it a long time ago with thier Migs. They have issues with technical competency and money. As it stands, thier Hornets cannot even fire Amraams after being allowed to buy 20 of them. New combat/training jets like Hawks are falling from the skies together with old nuris and they would have the gall to trust thier own handiwork at improvising things? Balls.. i tell you. <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/redones/wink.png" alt="wink.png">Of course, we should always stay vigilant.</p>

              <p>The RMAF made a bold attempt to mix western avionic with Russian jet.Though it sound silly, it shows their flexibility in defence thinking.To say that using 'rojak' system will create problem sound way to simplistic. If it is implemented right it will turn out right.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Who are we to say that RMAF neglected their aircraft maintenance? Do we actually see RMAF left their aircraft to rot?canniballising for spare part?Lazy ground crews?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Proud to know that RSAF are the best in the region but RMAF,RTAF,TNI-AU must not be scorn at.</p>

              <p>It is not a bold attempt to try anything ingenius. They were prevented access to a lot of things on the F18s. They had no choice. As for their `rojak' system, it is a mess. Their skyhawks are rotting in the hot sun. They were undecided about the Migs. However, it is an indication as per how costly maintainence is when they decided to have them mothballed. They changed thier minds a couple of times about the Migs too. Now, they will use the Migs till 2010. Splendid waste of money. It is very very telling  about thier logistical support when brand new Hawks are crashing. The accident record of the old Nuris is self-explanatory but even the RSAF were using old second hand Hueys. However, it is appalling that they persist in using them; relying on cozy relationships with inefficient bumi companies. And all of these happened during peace-time deployments. </p>

              Skye,you seem to be on the conclusion that RMAF are a gone case.
              
              It's true that their Skyhawks are rotting in the sun.RMAF
               retired them already.A few were given away as gate guardian. I even saw one beside a roundabout in Perak,of all places. So i think RMAF don't give a hoot about them any longer.
              
              As for the Migs, RMAF never actually mothball their Migs and then reactivate them operationally.Only their defence minister mooted the idea.RMAF top brass must be loughing behind his back.Mothball Migs and replace with what?
              
              Hawks.They are crashing alright but not at the rate of 3-4 per year.Recent hawk crash was about 2 years ago.
              
              Same goes as for the Nuris.

              Just to add something about the Nuris crashes...
              
              It's a good thing somehow for RMAF since they have been pestering for new replacement for Nuris.Now the Malaysian govt are seriously considering for replacement.Hope RMAF will have a newer workhorse.

              <p>It is not a bold attempt to try anything ingenius. They were prevented access to a lot of things on the F18s. They had no choice. As for their <strong>`rojak'</strong> system, it is a mess. (<em>yeah right ..and this is your most brilliant analysis</em>)<strong>Their skyhawks are rotting in the hot sun</strong>.(<em>lol how many years are you in coma?</em>) They were undecided about the Migs. However, it is an indication as per how costly maintainence is when they decided to have them <strong>mothballed</strong>. (<em>oh boy.. so the one that we saw flying all over lankawi must be their RC plane..LOL</em>) They changed thier minds a couple of times about the Migs too. Now, they will use the Migs till 2010. Splendid waste of money. It is very very telling  about thier logistical support when <strong>brand new Hawks</strong> are crashing. (<em>how can be brand new after so many years of usage? LOL</em>)The accident record of the old Nuris is self-explanatory but <strong>even the RSAF were using old second hand Hueys</strong>. However, it is appalling that they persist in using them; relying on cozy relationships with inefficient bumi companies. And all of these happened during peace-time deployments. </p>
              <p>Two things can be deduced here;</p>
              <p>1) Some of <strong>thier systems are really old</strong> <em>(from ww2? lol)</em></p>
              <p>2) Simply<strong> bad logistical support</strong> and possibly <strong>bad training</strong> as well <em>(wuu huu how you know this? you actually saw their logistical aparatus and training program? lol)</em></p>
              <p>Any other air force in the region having the same problems<em>?.(.......mmmm how to answer this?  DUH? yeah...!?)</em></p>

              <p>it also require a better cowboy to not just dismiss the cowboy with the Glock as incompetent fool who has no idea how to look after his Glock let alone knowing how to use it.  if the coin did drop that is.</p>

              <p>btw, did i mentioned the cowboy with the Glock has a deputy sheriff badge on his chest?  LOL.</p>
