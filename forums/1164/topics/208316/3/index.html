And I've pointed my rifle at my mate during BMT before. But the gun wasn't loaded at all. Nope. I've not been caught. So, what have you got to say now that I've RODed?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_twisted.gif" alt="Twisted Evil" title="Twisted Evil"> </div></blockquote>Then all I've got to say is that either your instructors were negligent in not teaching you properly, or all those safety lessons which were taught to you never quite struck a note with you.<br><br>I don't know about you, but basic safety is something not to be taken lightly at all. Just because your instructors didn't catch you doesn't make what you did correct. I can still remember how my BMT platoon got lots and lots of PT when some people were caught for playing around with their M16s and playfully pointing them at each other. Even those who didn't do so were punished for not doing anything to stop their nonsense.<br><br>We have lost people due to breaches of safety, and we will continue to lose people so long as safety isn't being taken seriously. Many more will get injured.<br><br>As a medic spec I've seen for myself exactly what things can happen when safety rules are ignored or taken lightly. The guy who doesn't put on his helmet during trench digging gets a knock on the head by his careless buddy. The guy who doesn't drink enough water gets heat exhaustion. They were all victims of not taking basic safety seriously, and I'm the bugger who has to save their lives.<br><br>I realise I can't change your cavalier attitude towards basic safety no matter what I say here. All I can say is that you may laugh and take it as entertainment now, but if and when things do go wrong, you may not be laughing as loudly as before - if ever.<br><br>That's my last word to you. Good luck in whatever you're doing - with your cavalier attitude towards safety, you're really going to need it.</div>

That sparked a minor diplomatic row between Serbia and Norway. The Serbian government summoned the Norwegian ambassador and demanded an apology, if memory serves me right.<br><br>That was some pretty good satire though, I admit.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>aiyo, i wonder why the reporter would wanna make a mountain out of a mole hill by splashing it on the headline?? we've seen it, we've watched it, we laughed at it and move on. no big deal lah. by splashing onto the headline would inccur more view hits leh, so the reporter should bear the brunt as much as the video creator isn't it?<br><br>and of course when mindef was asked to make a public statement of the clips, you wouldn't expect them to say things like "we're fine with the videos as long as no one is hurt in the process" isn't it?<br><br>end of the day, wanna do, dun get caught, get caught liao, dun complain. if never kenna caught, also doesn't mean mindef not aware and dun wanna catch. they just see case by case.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>It is possible for MINDEF to sign a contract with a major phone manufacturer to develop a new series of phones strictly without cameras for use by the military. Recently released models such as the Sony ericsson M600i are 3G without the camera and many within the army are users of the phone.<br><br>However, it does not stamp out the discipline issue as already stated by many. Some punitive action should be taken against such violators and DB should not be ruled out, even for graduates with a place reserved in the Uni.<br><br>Those photographed shooting at each other obviously do not know the implications, neither were they educated about the NSF who died after a loaded GPMG round shot him in the chest at OCS Company line after the weapon was supposed to have been 'cleared' at the live firing area.</div>
