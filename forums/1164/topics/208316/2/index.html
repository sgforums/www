Adding words that give the wrong impression to readers is as good as editing photographs to make the situation worse than it actually is.<br><br>To clarify:<br><br>1. No training area with dirt paths and vegetation can possibly be in camp.  So technically speaking, the camera phone is not IN camp.<br><br>2.  The M-16 is a rifle.  Not a machine-gun.  A rifle just doesn't sound as serious or dangerous as a machine gun does it?  By terming it a "Machine-gun" clip, is IMO, sensationalising the article.<br><br>Also, some clips found on youtube at some times, were made with expressed permission by unit superiors.  I honestly find the way the journalist tried to make the situation more serious than it actually is, distasteful.  By the way, 44 clips generated by the search at youtube, also includes videos made by mindef itseful, videos that were taken at change of guard ceremonies at Istana, or just personal videos of some friends in the army.  Its NOT AS SERIOUS AS IT SOUNDS!<br><br>Major security breach? No.  Stop evading the issue that the real problem is the lack of discipline in the soldiers today.  I have yet to see a home-made video by NSFs or NSman that gives away any classified information, or doctrine in SAF operations, hence there is no security breach.  What I see is blatant disregard for regulations in place, which is a disciplinary problem rather than a security issue.<br><br>Security breach sounds more cool than disciplinary issues doesn't it?<br><br>I agree with mindef.  It's not funny. So address the issue, which is the lack of discipline and disregard for regulations rather than Security breach.<br><br>Writer of article should re-examine his viewpoint.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Dun accredit me, i'm sure everybody feels that the root issue here is not a security breach.  A security breach is something more on the line of divulging classified information, or a penetration of camps security as well.<br><br>Some of the less tasteful videos shown here, have in fact, done GOOD in showing the Singapore public that some of our soldiers are not a disciplined lot.  My apologies to the SAF for having their public image shattered.<br><br>Slight deviation:  I find it sad that one of our local short movies, "Zo Peng" was turned up in the youtube search, "Singapore", "ARmy," the author suggested.  Zo Peng was a very nicely done short film that should not be mislabeled or misunderstood as a Security breach.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Th ephoto of the rifle thingy appears quite serious and clearly wrong in terms of our safety protocols - but I admit I did not see this video.<br><br>The other video of a parody of teh NDP was a good-natured way of laughing at ourselves and looks akin to some of the skits I see at the last night of field training.<br><br>Except of course this skit is now shared with everyone in the world.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Have seen videos of US Military personnel and Brits being silly...like coastal hook exercise but end up falling and getting trapped in waist high mud. And they laugh bout it. I mean if MINDEF wants a role model, standard military, do they actually know what is a standard or they just follow what is done by other military? Have seen comical pictures of Israeli military as well...no big deal. If they want to have a standard, make sure it is uniform throughout without and dual standards and yes it is a security breach, but did they leak out top secret information or filmed/photographed equipment which is so hush-hush that we are still in denial about it? If no, then I would see that a letter or warning should be sufficient.<br><br>Besides, if they consider this as spoiling the SAF's image, then what about the video of some US trooper throwing flashbangs to scare those in the Bradley IFV? Doesn't make sense does it?And seriously, there are more important issues that should be improved and debated on, they choose not to, but pick on this petty issue to issue a public statement.This shows the senior management within has got too much free time on their hands doesn't it?</div>
