Anything else, is not obligatory.<br><br>If you cannot even respect the tenet of accurate reportage, and beat your own chest when foreign publications interview politicians from other parties, and simultaneously "encourage" one-sided press coverage from the 140th media, what then is partisan press coverage?<br><br>Don't tell me to swallow the crap that you can spin on.

            <div class='col-md body'>It may not be the actual ATEC but.......... perhaps some dry runs without SBO and helmets. Or it can be a 'NG' part of the filming, some how they did not delete it and it got into the hands of someone who wants to post it on you tube. Battalions may have made this clip as teaching materials for their own ppls to prep them for ATEC thus it need not have come from the ATEC center.</div>
