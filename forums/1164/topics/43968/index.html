It can be manually guide to the target with its cruise level changable with the wave level.<br><br>In terms of long range strike , the MGB/MCVs and Fokker50s will provide that cover and with Hawkeye for over the horizon targeting. However in terms of running with the crowds , the Garbiel will be ideal.<br></div>

Singapore was once extremely interested with the Visby , the PVs will have to go one day ( 5 to 10 yrs time?? )so.... Our Submarine force is still at infancy , new plateforms should have been evaluated. It isnt a dream , but a question of when will the replacement be made , wat will be the weaponary.........</div>
