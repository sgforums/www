            <div class='col-md body'>My suspicion is that these MAF soldiers have something to do with the unrest in southern thailand.   Perhaps they were inciting them, or were providing some means to help the rebels.<br><br>Otherwise, WHY the CV attire, but why still carry arms?  No military identification.  Perhaps they were not meant to be caught alive?</div>
