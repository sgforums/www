            <div class='col-md body'>I totally agreed that we are definitely not "1st" in that sense.<br><br>We still need a government agency to develop and bring an idea forward. In that aspect, we must applause them from translating a toy idea to an equipment we can use for miltary and security purposes.<br><br>Nonetheless, i wish the people at DSTA and ST will stop bragging about their "success" but focus in developing scientist who can think out of the box.  In due time, we will have the R&amp;D expertises to develop a truely "1st". Needless to say, this whole process will surely be costly. Till then, we just have to make do.<br><br></div>

That's a fact in the material world we are living in. To be honestly, i'm not sure if they are that highly paid (as compared to people in the commerial R&amp;D). I got many friends who are scientisits and engineers with DSTA, A-STAR, ST, DSO ranging from mirco biology, bacteria, weapons, ammo &amp; CCC.</span><br><br>in toys, drawings, it's easy to develop anything. like lightsabers in star wars, george lucas did it for more than 20years ? yet we arent even close to develop lasers 2% of their strength.<br><br><span style="color: cyan;">2% it may be, but who is to say that it would come true one day? Surely not lightsabers (Personal i wish they could develop one  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"> ) but missle defense, the infamous starwars defense umbrella pushed so dearly during Ronald Regent's adminstration. Of course, we do not go about developing all ideas. In R&amp;D, idea screening is important only. Just pray that our guys dun embark on some useless R&amp;D to leads to nowhere.</span><br><br></div></blockquote></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>The paradox about DSOÂ’s work is that the more critical it is, the less we are able to discuss it. Here, we give you a flavour of but some of the highly exciting R&amp;D work that is brewing in some of our labs.<br><blockquote> <strong>Portable device for through-wall motion detection<br><br></strong>R&amp;D work is underway to develop a radar for Â“through-wallÂ” motion detection. This through-wall radar surveillance technology enables remote location and tracking of the movements of multiple individuals through concrete walls.<br><br>Positioned at a distance away, the system transmits ultra wideband electro-magnetic energy that penetrates through wall to detect objects and sense their movements.<br><br>This technology could support a number of important applications in both national security and military operations. They include search and rescue operations, counter terrorism and urban warfare situations.<br><br>DSO researchers are also looking further into exploiting the potential of this new radar technology to detect weapons or to show the structural layout behind a wall.</blockquote><blockquote><strong> Unmanned undersea robot Â– a safer way to clear mines<br></strong><br>DSO is conducting R&amp;D to develop an autonomous underwater vehicle that will carry out the dangerous task of detecting underwater mines. Started in 2002, the project exploits various expertise of DSO, such as underwater vehicle design, hydrodynamics, system integration, guidance, navigation and control (GNC).<br><br>The 2m-long underwater robot is called SEA-i, a name synonymous to its purpose of being the eyes in the undersea. Running on battery power, the vehicle can travel at six knots, or about 3m a second, for eight hours and can dive to a depth of 100m.<br><br>The Sea-i is designed with a Â“brainÂ” so the course can be pre-programmed. Equipped with sensors, the vehicle will be able to better sense the environment and efficiently map out the area of interest for mine detection.<br><br>The Sea-i is still a developmental vehicle that serves to experiment various concepts. DSOÂ’s engineers are working on improving the craft's agility and ability to navigate precisely underwater. The team also hopes to improve the image-processing feature of the Sea-i so that the vehicle can eventually conduct automatic on-board classification of underwater objects.<br><br></blockquote>fr <a href="http://www.dso.org.sg/home/capabilities/capabilities_tech.aspx" rel="nofollow">http://www.dso.org.sg/home/capabilities/capabilities_tech.aspx</a></div>
