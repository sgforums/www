The size of each UAV could be visibly reduced to maybe half or a third in size and could have folding wings so as to be modular and save space.<br><br>Everytime it needed to lauch a UAV yes it would surface only for a while like a whale coming up to get some air then dive down again. And since UAV can now loiter for hours theres no need surface and dive so often thereby not compromising it's position.</div>

The reason is with runway, it is still the fastest way to recover &amp; launch air-vehicles ! Because still you would want to have the shortest time to recover numberous air-vehicle at a go and also launch a number of vehicles at a go.<br></div>

Better yet, when the US decides to put 6 CBG in one area.....that says alot more then 6 of these subs!</div>
