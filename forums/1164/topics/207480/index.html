            <div class='col-md body'>"The Eagle and the Albatross", a doctoral thesis by Commander David Joseph Wilson RAN, at the Australian Defence Force Academy of the University of New South Wales in 2003 reveals an interesting contingency plan drawn up by the Royal Australian Navy in the 1950's.<br><br><blockquote>Under ANZAM the RAN was committed to the proposition that, as <span style="color: red;">the RN intended to withdraw from 'East of Suez' at the outbreak of a Europe-centered war</span>, it would be responsible for the protection of sea routes 'over a large proportion of three major oceans' and to <span style="color: red;">convoy Australian land and air forces to the Middle East</span>. Once this commitment was met, the RAN was expected to provide a proportion of its strength (including the Carrier Task Group) for 'service elsewhere'.51<br><br>Three months later the Defence Committee considered that the Soviet threat to sea communications would be attacks by long-range submarine that would use the traditional torpedo/gun attack on shipping at sea and the laying of mines at focal points.52 The anti-submarine role was well suited to the Light Fleet Carrier and its embarked aircraft, but placed the Navy in a defensive role. The RAAF maritime reconnaissance force also shared this defensive charter. <span style="color: red;">Plans drawn up in February 1951 for the deployment of a Mobile Task Force to the Middle East or Malaya</span> illustrate this mind-set. The plan envisaged a squadron of eight Lincolns supplementing the three heavy bomber, two long range fighter and two transport squadrons - but these would be utilised only to 'patrol the maritime approaches' of Malaya.53<br><br>51 Defence Committee, 29 November 1951, 1365/8, CRS A5954/60, AA.<br>52 Defence Committee, 14 February 1952, ibid.<br>53 Stephens, Going Solo, pp 32, 35</blockquote>The Australians assumed that in a general war against the Soviet Russia in the 1950's they would have to defend the Middle East just like they did against the Germans in the 1st and 2nd world wars and defend Malaya against - probably - the Chinese Communists.<br><br>He also argued the RAAF and RAN of that time were pressured by the UK and US to fit into a capability niche within their force structures.<br><br><blockquote>The RAAF and RAN have been subjected to the pressures of powerful allies to fit into a capability niche within the overbearing numbers and technology of their combat power. The has tended to distort the structure of both then RAAF and RAN.<br><br>For example, in the 1960s, the RAAF maritime force and the RAN became anti-submarine oriented. The lack of combat capability during the period of Indonesian confrontation with Malaysia was an unpalatable prospect for both Australian services.<br><br>This example illustrates that the national interest of a small ally may not always be of paramount importance to, or even recognized, by a great power.</blockquote>The navies of Canada and the Netherlands were built to fit into the capability niche - anti-submarine warfare - within NATO as well.<br><br>You can download the thesis at <a href="http://www.library.unsw.edu.au/~thesis/adt-ADFA/public/adt-ADFA20031029.102545/index.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.library.unsw.edu.au/~thesis/adt-ADFA/public/adt-ADFA20031029.102545/index.html</a>.<br><br>Cheers,<br>Sunho</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>They can independently project power in the South Pacific and the area immediate north of the Australian continent. But I doubt they can do so now in the South-East Asia, let alone the Middle East.<br><br>In the early 1950's Malaysia and Singapore did not yet exist as sovereign states and the military power of Indonesia was negligible compared with what the Australians had at that time.<br><br>Cheers,<br>Sunho<br><br></div>
