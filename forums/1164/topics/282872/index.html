            <div class='col-md body'><strong><br><br>TEMECULA, Calif. - He was one of America's first defenders on Sept. 11, 2001, a Marine who pulled burned bodies from the ruins of the Pentagon. He saw more horrors in Kuwait and Iraq.<br><br>ADVERTISEMENT<br><br>Today, he can't keep a job, pay his bills, or chase thoughts of suicide from his tortured brain. In a few weeks, he may lose his house, too.<br><br>Gamal Awad, the American son of a Sudanese immigrant, exemplifies an emerging group of war veterans: the economic casualties.<br><br>More than in past wars, many wounded troops are coming home alive from the Middle East. That's a triumph for military medicine. But they often return hobbled by prolonged physical and mental injuries from homemade bombs and the unremitting anxiety of fighting a hidden enemy along blurred battle lines. Treatment, recovery and retraining often can't be assured quickly or cheaply.<br><br>These troops are just starting to seek help in large numbers, more than 185,000 so far. But the cost of their benefits is already testing resources set aside by government and threatening the future of these wounded veterans for decades to come, say economists and veterans' groups.<br><br>"The wounded and their families no longer trust that the government will take care of them the way they thought they'd be taken care of," says veterans advocate Mary Ellen Salzano.<br><br>How does a war veteran expect to be treated? "As a hero," she says.<br><br>___<br><br>Every morning, Awad needs to think of a reason not to kill himself.<br><br>He can't even look at the framed photograph that shows him accepting a Marine heroism medal for his recovery work at the Pentagon after the terrorist attack.<br><br>It might remind him of a burned woman whose skin peeled off in his hands when he tried to comfort her.<br><br>He tries not to hear the shrieking rockets of Iraq either, smell the burning fuel, or relive the blast that blew him right out of bed.<br><br>The memories come steamrolling back anyway.<br><br>"Nothing can turn off those things," he says, voice choked and eyes glistening.<br><br>He stews alternately over suicide and finances, his $43,000 in credit card debt, his $4,330 in federal checks each month Â— the government's compensation for his total disability from post-traumatic stress disorder. His flashbacks, thoughts of suicide, and anxiety over imagined threats Â— all documented for six years in his military record Â— keep him from working.<br><br>The disability payments don't cover the $5,700-a-month cost of his adjustable home mortgage and equity loans. He owes more on his house than its market value, so he can't sell it Â— but he may soon lose it to the bank.<br><br>"I love this house. It makes me feel safe," he says.<br><br>Awad could once afford it. He used to earn $100,000 a year as a 16-year veteran major with a master's degree in management who excelled at logistics. Now, at age 38, he can't even manage his own life.<br><br>There's another twist. This dedicated Marine was given a "general" discharge 15 months ago for an extramarital affair with a woman, also a Marine. That's even though his military therapists blamed this impulsive conduct on post-traumatic stress aggravated by his Middle East tours.<br><br>Luckily, his discharge, though not unqualifiedly honorable, left intact his rights to medical care and disability payments Â— or he'd be in sadder shape.<br><br>Divorced since developing PTSD, Awad has two daughters who live elsewhere. He spends much of his days hoisting weights and thwacking a punching bag in the dimness of his garage. He passes nights largely sleepless, a zombie shuffling through the bare rooms of his home in sunny California wine country.<br><br></strong><br><br>Look at the american whining , so think about his counterpart in Iraq their countries is in a ruin , they wont have time to engage in extra marital affair nor high credit card bill 11</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>nontheless.. there are lessons to be learn...<br><br>i think its time for SAF to think of coming up with a veteran funds now in peace...<br><br>start saving now... build up a massive portfolio like temasek or the GIC.<br><br>so that after a war(if it should come to pass), the SAF would have a mountain of cash to help the surviving veterans and their families, including families of deceased soldiers to live in a dignified manner.</div>
