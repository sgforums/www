But the energy from the<br>explosion vapourised the water, reducing the effect of the blast by 60 per<br>cent.<br>Hailing the results as a major breakthrough, DSTA chief executive Richard<br>Lim said yesterday that defence engineers worldwide had considered using water<br>barriers to reduce the effect of an explosion.<br>But none had tested the idea on the scale of the experiment conducted in<br>Sweden last month. He added that the experiments are important as water<br>barriers can potentially reduce the amount of land needed as a safety buffer<br>around ammunition bunkers.<br>Mr Lim updated the media on research developments at DSTA when he unveiled a<br>60-page book to mark five years of DSTA's achievements.<br>The book will be distributed to organisations such as government bodies,<br>tertiary institutions and public libraries.<br>DSTA was formed five years ago from several Ministry of Defence departments<br>to serve as the national authority on weapons procurements and military<br>technology.<br>Mr Lim added that another area his engineers are working on is to help<br>national security planners assess the impact of a bomb blast, similar to the<br>car bomb detonated outside the JW Marriott Hotel in Jakarta. The August 2003<br>terror attack killed 12 people.<br>'One of the scenarios that we are looking into is the extent of building<br>damage and casualties in the event of a car bomb exploding near or at the<br>entrance of a hotel, similar to the attack at the Marriott,' he said.<br>From its analysis, using computer modelling and other tools, DSTA will<br>recommend measures to minimise casualties and damages, if not prevent an<br>attack.</blockquote></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Another Sg's breakthrough in underground storage?<br><br>1.  <blockquote>Key developmental projects by JTC in FY 2005<br><br>Underground cavern at Jurong Island<br><br>7                    JTC has completed a Phase II feasibility study for an underground cavern for hydrocarbon storage in Jurong Island. The Phase II study focuses on viable business models, technical and economic feasibility of the underground cavern which will help enhance Singapore's  position as a regional oil trading and storage hub. From the study, the conceptual plan for the underground cavern complex indicates that there is a potential of over 3 million cubic metres of underground storage.<br><br>8                    JTC is currently speaking to potential customers, as well as continuing to discuss with industry players to obtain inputs and feedback. The Corporation is expected to have more details on project implementation in a few months' time. </blockquote> Press Release of JTC dd 21 July 2005<br>fr <a href="http://www.jtc.gov.sg/Corporate/media+room/(pr)+21+july+2005.asp" rel="nofollow">http://www.jtc.gov.sg/Corporate/media+room/(pr)+21+july+2005.asp</a><br><br>2.  <blockquote>...and a $760 million  underground cavern on Jurong Island that could have <strong>three million cubic  m of oil storage...... fr STimes 22.07.2005 pH34<br><br>Currently,the max. storage capacity on ground in Sg for oil is 22.3 million barrels...A new on ground storage of 1.5 million barrels costs $100 m</strong> STimes 21.07.05</blockquote>3.
