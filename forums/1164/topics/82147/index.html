It will fully arm only Sg recived all 6 in 2009.  There is 3 resons I could think of.<br><br>Firstly, the 2  weapons Ex-40 block 3 and unarm heli will be ready in 2-3 years time.<br>Secondly, Sg do not want to provike it neighbour to start an arm race.<br>Thirdly, will be the cost.  No doubt Sg is rich, the 6 ships is a big spend by SAF.  SAF do not has the fund to fully equip it 6 ships yet.  The 8 heli for the 6 ships has been reduce to 4 heli.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I'm wondering where did cutebug got his information from . In Naval Technology Magazine, (I believe issue 10 or 11) , it was stated that Singapore, Korea, Taiwan, Egypt and Australia ( Not including Europe ) has purchased the upgraded kit for the Harpoon System to Block 2. The SG Navy did contemplated in buying the  MM40 Block 3 during the early evaluation years. but with the advent of Boeing Harpoon upgraded kit, it is the logical choice in acquiring the upgrade kit due to SG large inventory of AGM84.<br><br>For the DELTA ASTER, it was indicated in SIPRI Yearbook that we are only getting the ASTER 15 with VLS 43. However ASTER 30 (JDW) is being considered for our I-Hawk 2 replacement in the far future.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Quote from 'Simon Tan' from ACIG<br><blockquote>Curiously the Singaporeans are getting the mid length Slyver launch tubes in the original 22inch format. This mean they can load ASTER 30....but cannot load TACTOM like the RN will ahve on the Darings. The French are engineering SCALP Navale to the 22inch tube but theya re working on a 25-inch tube that is dimensionally indenctical to the Mk41 and can take things like ESSM quad-packs.<br></blockquote>On the info of the aster 15 @ the naval technology webby<br><blockquote>Pure DisInt on the ASTER 15. I was down in SG when they unveiled the Delta and had a very long chat with some of the Slyver design team. They're soft-pedalling the capabilities of the Delta boats.</blockquote></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by damienthedevil:</div><div class="quote_body">I'm wondering where did cutebug got his information from . In Naval Technology Magazine, (I believe issue 10 or 11) , it was stated that Singapore, Korea, Taiwan, Egypt and Australia ( Not including Europe ) has purchased the upgraded kit for the Harpoon System to Block 2. The SG Navy did contemplated in buying the  MM40 Block 3 during the early evaluation years. but with the advent of Boeing Harpoon upgraded kit, it is the logical choice in acquiring the upgrade kit due to SG large inventory of AGM84.<br><br>For the DELTA ASTER, it was indicated in SIPRI Yearbook that we are only getting the ASTER 15 with VLS 43. However ASTER 30 (JDW) is being considered for our I-Hawk 2 replacement in the far future.</div></blockquote>having purchased the upgrade kit for the harpoon does not imply that RSN has given up on the MM40 block 3... since we still have many ships like the MCV, fokker 50 MPA that still uses harpoon.<br><br>SIPRI yearbook may have listed the purchase of ASTER 15 and Sylver A43... but then SIPRI cannot possibly list the purchase of every item that SAF has bought.</div>
