After they locked on, they asked whether the planes were friends or foe and an international sign indicating we're friends was relayed back.' </strong><br><br>He said the US-made F-16s were dispatched after the US Hornets were picked up by air force radar and also noticed by an Indonesian airliner off the main island of Java.<br><br>He said the US planes were guarding an aircraft carrier, two frigates and a tanker which were travelling east.<br><br>He said the convoy was not in an area designated as a legal sea lane for passage, although the country's air force chief earlier said it was.<br><br>A spokesman for the US embassy in Jakarta said they were looking into the incident.<br><br>An Indonesian air force spokesman blamed the incident on slow Indonesian bureaucracy, adding the United States had sought permission to pass through but this was not approved in time.<br><br>'This was a sign of weakness in our bureaucracy because the request had to go through several institutions before it reached the hands of the air defence command on the ground,' air force spokesman Sagom Tamboen told local radio El Shinta.<br><br>The incident follows efforts to rebuild US-Indonesian military relations that were cut in response to Jakarta's failure to rein in militias that rampaged in Timor Leste when the tiny territory voted to break free in 1999. -- Reuters, AP</div>

Assuming that we are using a similar version, it would extend the viper's fuel capacity to 10172lbs.<br><br>Full Afterburners gobble up fuel at 58000lbs per hour for the viper.  Approx 966lbs a minute.  Lets round it up to 1000lbs a min.<br><br>This means that the F-16 can now punch AB for a full 10 minutes!  Of course not that anyone goes into Afterburners for 10mins.<br><br>Dogfights might use up quite a bit of fuel, given bad entry condition.

Malaysian Authorities were slow in authorizing an RSAF SAR team to pass thru their airspace to rescued the brit.
