Much like the combined arms divisions which we have for our army, i am sure we can doing something to improve the situation which we have for our underwater assets as well.<br><br>We must continuously seek new ways so as to stay one step ahead of our potential enemies to maintain our formidable deterrance stance. Therefore i am speculating on how we can do things better in a realistic setting.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Undoubtedly the need is there, but the question remains as to whether the technology is available.  It seems that water is not as friendly a medium to radio transmissions as air is.  As far as I'm aware, the US Navy's subs receive a heads-up by way of an low frequency transmission, after which they surface and receive satellite transmissions with the actual message.</div>

Usually they can be working as a pack , but usually in a co-ordinate manner each covering a certain sector, rather then 2 - 3 working side by side.<br>They are more of lone hunters.<br><br>But then the attack on peal harbour did show some small mini-sub of the japanese navy and regular subs doing co-ordinated attack on pearl harbour.<br><br></div>
