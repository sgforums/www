            <div class='col-md body'>Well, one that i have to mention isn't a movie, but a TV series. Anyone remember MASH? It was a comedy about a field hospital in the Korean War...<br><br>It was interesting to watch a bunch of anti-authority, anti-establishment people stuck in a war none of them wanted, but had to fulfil their duties as medics and doctors to save lives. On top of that, the characters and their antics were hilarious.... Like Clinger, the medic who is desperate to get out of the war and always wears dresses to convince everyone he's insane, and the poor CO who's more of a doctor than a soldier and hasn't the faintest idea how to run a military unit, and whose authority nobody seems to recognise.<br><br>On a more serious note, i think that Tora Tora Tora was one of the best war movies of all time. It was realistic, gripping, and informative at the same time.<br><br>My two cent's worth.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Personal favs in no order of preference:<br>Full Metal Jacket (for its powerful symbolism)<br>Saving Pte Ryan (for realism and the shock factor)<br>Windtalkers (pretty shocking too)<br>Pearl Harbour (beautiful love story... very emotionally charged show)<br>Enemy at the Gates (highly strung show.... the tension of 2 snipers baiting each other out. Based on a true story)<br>Merry Christmas Mr Lawrance (gave rise to that beautifully haunting tune... was it called "Spirit of Asia"? u know later got ppl do into techno track one)<br>Blackhawk down (.... I read about this incident in 1994 while doing research into Elite forces back in 2000.... realised that not many people knew about it until they released the movie... it was yet another very sad incident. you could feel the desperation of the rangers and the DF people.)<br>Band of Brothers (was good too!)<br>Movies which i haven't watched but i want to and i think they are good:<br>Apocalyspe Now<br>MASH<br>think there was this show about some radio america in vietnam.... whats the title of it? think its good.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>My favourite war movies are:<br>1. Patton<br>2. The Longest Day<br>3. Tora Tora Tora<br>4. The Lost Battalion<br>5. Saving Private Ryan<br>6. Thin Red Line<br>7. Platoon<br><br>About the film Patton, it is not totally accurate about the great man. I read from a biography written by Carlo D'Este about Patton that the show's military advisor happens to be Bradley and he hates Patton. That's why the film sort of make Patton look bad most of the time. The soldier slap is true but the Russian speech is quite fake becos he did mention Russians but BBC didn't note it down.<br><br>Favourite conversation between Patton and Ike: (similar to the following)<br><br>Ike: I want you to take Trier with 4 divisions.<br><br>Patton: Already captured Trier with 2 divisions.
