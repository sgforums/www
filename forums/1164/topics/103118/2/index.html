It's been enough of a stimulus to let reservist units achieve REDCON status &amp; operate alongside their active cohorts.<br><br>You know this guilt complex which Vietnam vets go through having about a comrade dying or getting hurt instead of them? Not many reservists will admit this, but that feeling of "culpability" exists here too - albeit not as emotional. It usually occurs whenever someone misses an ICT callup he could've otherwise make adjustments to attend. (Not referring to the genuine deferment cases, though kudos to the SAF for tweaking the conscience by enforcing "penitent" make-up ICTs with an unfamiliar unit.) With the original outfit, the non-attendee knows his reservist colleagues usually have to cover for his absence, i.e. taking on double duties without added financial compensation.

I mean, his successor was more than adequate (&amp; popular) but once he got his 3rd bar, the original guy couldn't return back &amp; had to be posted out.<br><br>Re: "enlisted promoting to an officer." That'll only happen ad-hoc in crisis or wartime scenarios. In peacetime, enlistees would have to be redirected back to extensive OCS training, &amp; thus applicable for those wanting to sign-on.

Granted, many of us won't necessarily hanker for the SAFRA resort &amp; country-club facilities, or benefit from the bigger allowances for KAHs.<br><br>Nonetheless, there's the preferential taxes, preferential share ownership top-up, enhanced IPPT/marksmanship monetary awards, finetuning of ICT stints, shortening of ICT cycle, 10-year passports for NSFs, decentralizing exit-permit applications, et al. - all of them formalized only within the last decade or so. That's plenty of material gratitude, a big change from my uncle's own "mah see sar kor" ("also $3") reservist days.</div></blockquote>This is what this topic is about; rewarding the normal reservists who have sacrifice their sweat and time in the service of their country with the prospect of promotion (may it be within the enlisted ranks, or an enlisted promoted to an officer).  As for the other incentives, I believe the Government and RECORD have done a wonderful job, and I hope they will continue to do so.<br><br>I also understand that in a organizational there can be so many workers, fewer supervisor, even fewer managers, and unltimately 1 person at the top of the organization <span style="font-style: italic;">(i.e. too many cooks spoil the soup)</span>, and that promotion is also hugely dependent on the availability of higher appointments and opportunity to rise within the reserves.<br><br>However, this does not mean that rank promotion is impractical, but rather if the NSmen is willing, give him the opportunity to rise within the reserves.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Still bleating the same stuff. Any new tangent at all?<br><br><blockquote>if the NSmen is willing, give him the opportunity to rise</blockquote>Why so - as they say, your grandfather's army, ah? ~lol~<br><br>But, yes, there's such exploitable lobang with the present rank system for reservists (except, again, it won't be as a rote reward).<br><br>I'm more of a traditionalist in preferring the old classification, which was basic but most sensible;<br><br>CO/RSM -------------&gt; OC/CSM -------&gt; PC/PS -----------------&gt; SL-HIC/2IC<br>(MAJ/WO2-SSG)        (CPT/SGT)          (LTA-2LT/SGT-CPL)      (CPL/LCP)<br><br>IMO The current rank structure is too politician-influenced &amp; rendered too complicated. For all its "more affirmative" &amp; "visibly upgradable" rationale, I think it can create more bureaucratic pettiness for the military hierarchy. Eg. Soldier A, for all his accomplishments, can't be promoted to above the incumbent Soldier's B's rank without accompanying new job responsibilities.<br><br>The post-'93 WOSE reforms that IMO concerned frontline reservists most were;<br><br>(a) the WO, upon affirmed as the 4th "executive" commander (joining MAJ, CPT &amp; subalterns), is now too senior for RSM postings. Its rank is now recognized as equivalent to CPT level.<br><br>(b) the former NCO corps gained 5 separate ranks (MSG/SSG/1SG/2SG/3SG), &amp; this is where reservists can get most advancements. A junior commander can definately make 2SG before he stands down; ditto 1SG for the more senior specialist KAHs. SSG-to-MSG isn't really a big deal; IMO it's more to offset against the new WO status, but what it does confirm is that the RSM now holds a Spec rank (albeit senior one).<br><br>[Specialist-to-WO now requires attending a formal tri-service Joint-WO course, kinda the WOSE version of OCS, before getting promoted. Quite rare for reservists.]<br><br>(c) enlisted men now gains the CPL &amp; PFC along with the LCP. No rank-pulling allowed here; the hierarchy differentiation's more with between, say, HIC (head IC) &amp; 2IC instead.<br><br>Overall, if you think about it, the combat-unit appointments (see above) hadn't fundamentally changed, nor has the general partitioning of the rank &amp; file:<br><br>Officer corps -------&gt; NCO/Specialist Corps ------&gt; Enlisted men<br><br>Regardless of specific rank, it still requires extraordinary circumstances for non-regulars to advance out of each scission.<br><br>But there's no obstacle stopping Specs from being promoted within its "internal" grades, based on ICT performances &amp; pragmatic unit needs. Ambitious reservists can maneuver themselves into filling in for missing incumbents &amp;, if they continue to defer the next call-up too, then fight to be a permanent replacement.<br><br>I have no problems either if the SAF elects to withhold the LTA promotions before ORD, &amp; wait till after the 2nd ICT. The junior officers tend to mature more as NSmen than they did as NSFs anyway.<br><br>Among enlisted men, CPLs have no business advancing to a leadership rank like 3SG as a peacetime "reward." &amp;, for now, LCPs can't make CPL without the post-O Levels cert either. But, that's said there's nothing from stopping enlisted men from switching postings, vis-&amp;-vis against unit needs. Combat-fit signallers &amp; combat medics could all along be deployed to any Formation. Even for same-Formation troops, working with a 155mm howitzer is totally different from the Primus. Active-time PTIs (Specs, mind you) &amp; MPs revert back to INF for reservist.<br><br>What all these examples required is a short induction course, or at worst on-the-job training. That's how I became a mono-intake instructor, &amp; how one Malay reservist colleague of mine successfully switched from driver to RP (after a few ICTs of persuading the MTO to release his services). But "other ranks" climbing to 3SG or CPL rank - forget it.<br><br>What's your rank &amp; vocation?<br></div>
