Reservist military culture is different from the "active time" version. During NSF, it's the regulars who holds the so-called KAH jobs - &amp; they include SAF scholars, Formation-school transfers, condemned cases, plus the mundane signed-on's.<br><br>In reservist, it'll all leadership by citizen soldiers, with only the senior KAHs likely "recyclists" on their 2nd tours (either ROVERS-extended or reposted after their old outfits stood down). The junior-commander LTAs &amp; 2SG/3SGs have also to directly lead their men now, yet cannot "pull-rank" like the old conscript days. So even as orders must be made/followed, a new personal relationship also has to be cultivated - &amp; it's one that often spills over to the civilian side as well (work, clientale, neighbors, hobby, friends).<br><br>IMO This "bonding" cultivation can take place over the first 5-6 ICTs, partly cuz they meet up only for for 1-4 weeks each time. I'm not prepared to say I would definately throw myself over a grenade for a reservist buddy, but I've experienced sharing a foxhole with him, have attended his wedding &amp; seen the birth of his child, &amp; him the same with me. Now extrapolate this out for a whole BN. The interpersonal ties become so familiarized that the officers &amp; senior specialists weren't even addressed as "sir" or "enciks", but by their appointments ("CO," "BSO"; or "Ah Thong the RQ", etc.").<br><br>Of course, this collective kinship will someday hit diminishing returns, usually in the late-20s when reservists are burdened by civilian workloads &amp; the tending of a growing nuclear family. I myself experienced it after my 2nd Ex Starlight trip in the mid-'90s, &amp; I like to think it's our feedback that help brought about the latest reservist reforms (shortened training cycle, with BIT refreshers to round up its finishing).</div>
