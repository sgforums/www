              <p>
              </p><p class="MsoNoSpacing">It was just past five in the evening, Indian Standard
              Time, when the initial signs of Chinese air activity were picked up by the
              Indian Air Force’s mobile observation posts along the McMahon Line that
              represented the border between the Indian state of Arunachal Pradesh and Tibet.
              The Mobile Observation Posts (MOPs) which consisted of two man teams armed with
              nothing more than night vision binoculars, infrared sensors, an aircraft
              identification booklet and a VHF radio remained India’s first and most critical
              line of air defence even in the 21<sup>st</sup> century, and even as the Indian Air Force (IAF) rapidly attempted to modernize itself.</p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing"> </p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing">For the two men who made up MOP Alpha Lima Fifteen, it
              had been a bleak and uneventful two months of being holed up in a bunker in the
              side of Peak 5850, and recording the coming and going of civilian aircraft at
              the Chinese airport at Nyingchi Mainling – located barely 20 kilometres north
              of the border with India. Their bunker, located a tenacious forty kilometres
              trek north from the last asphalted road that led from the nearest Indian town
              of Yingkiong, offered them an unobstructed view of the Yarlung Zanbo river
              valley in the Chinese side, which with its criss-crossing highways and rapidly
              developing settlements  posed a sharp
              contrast to the primitive infrastructure uninhabited mountain-scape on the
              Indian side. On the Chinese side were housing layouts, army barracks and
              industrial complexes all linked by a network of roads, while on the Indian side
              were nothing more than a handful of half deserted shanty towns threaded
              together precariously with a single narrow broken road that winded through the
              mountain slopes.</p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing"> </p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing">So far, the only air activity that MOP Alpha Lima 15 had
              dutifully recorded and transmitted to the command post had been the solitary
              Air China A319 flight from Chengdu that landed every morning at six and which took
              off promptly an hour later. Their command post was the located at a line of
              radar pickets some 150 km south of their position in the Indian state of Assam.
              Then there was the occasional Mi-17 or Harbin Z-6 helicopter operated by the
              PLA’s 2<sup>nd</sup> Army Aviation Regiment based at Lhasa meandering
              harmlessly through the peaks far inside Chinese territory, and which
              nevertheless had to be reported with detailed coordinates, altitudes and
              bearings.</p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing"> </p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing">But today, the thankless and wearisome job had taken an
              unexpected turn of excitement, when the two men were alerted from their slumber
              late in the evening by the sounds of several roaring jets in the distance.
              Stumbling out of their bunker into the biting cold and the fading light, the
              men checked their tripod mounted Infrared Search and Track Reconnaissance (ISTR)
              scanner and gasped in amazement before grabbing their VHF radio receiver and
              alerting the command post. There, marked by several hazy red blips across the
              dark scope of the German manufactured ISTR scanner were the tell-tale signs of
              several Chinese fighter jets, approaching their position from the North-West.</p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing"> </p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing">“Alpha Lima 15 to Command Echo Five! Message alert red!”
              The terse message was relayed by VHF radio with the accompanying alert code
              that would assign it maximum priority. “Counting sixteen bogeys at twenty
              eight, twelve zero eight dot nine three and ninety-three, thirty four, one-two
              dot seven four, bearing ten o’clock, altitude 4000m, estimated speed 450 knots!
              Bogeys appear to be following the river valley towards Lima-Zulu-Yankee
              airport.”</p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing"> </p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing">At an altitude of just over 4000m above mean sea level,
              the 16 Chinese aircrafts were just below the line of mountain peaks that
              separated China from India, and would have been undetectable to ground based
              radars on the Indian side.</p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing"> </p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing">The message raised a flurry of activity on the Indian
              side. More than a hundred kilometres to the south of MOP Alpha Lima 15, radar
              clusters located at Chabua, Jorhat, Guwahati and Tezpur in the state of Assam
              increased the output power on their Soviet era ST68U and P-18/P-19 radars and
              lit up the mountain peaks north of them, creating a line of virtual radar
              floodlights that stretched from Bhutan in the west to Myanmar in the east.
              Along the narrow passes and gaps between the line of formidable Himalayan peaks,
              and especially at the 20km wide Tsangpo Gorge that separated the two realms,
              short range Indian made INDRA radars lit up the mountainsides and waited for
              targets to appear.</p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing"> </p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing">“Identification! Joker! Joker! Sixteen numbers Joker!”
              The MOP continued its message, the sounds of the jets evident in the background
              in spite of the static.</p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing"> </p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing">Joker was the vaguely cynical code assigned by the IAF to
              describe the Chengdu J-7 Air-Guards  that
              formed the bulk and backbone of China’s People’s Liberation Army Air Force. But
              even as tension built up across the four fully alerted radar pickets across
              Assam, the radar screens stayed blank, the enemy aircraft staying at extremely
              low altitudes and well hidden behind the screen of mountain peaks. Meanwhile 500
              kilometres away from the MOP bunker, in Shillong, the message about the Chinese
              military aircraft flying in such vicinity to the Line of Control had just
              reached the Air Defence Control Centre (ADCC) located there, and the gear
              wheels of India’s air defences began to move into place.</p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing"> </p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing">Shillong, the capital of the Indian state of Meghalaya,
              just west of Assam, served as the headquarters of the IAF’s Eastern Air
              Command, and the nucleus of its Air Defence Ground Environment System (ADGES)
              for the North East of India. As soon as the message was received from the radar
              pickets, the massive French made cold war era THD1955 radar sitting atop a
              pyramidal tower adjoining the ADCC building increased its output from the
              regular 2MW to an astounding 15MW, bringing the whole of Assam, Bhutan,
              Arunachal Pradesh and large swathes of Chinese Tibet under its powerful glare –
              but, still, the radar screens stayed blank and devoid of any activity on the
              Chinese side. All that it received was the peripheral green glare around the
              scopes that came from the radar beams bouncing off the distant peaks along the international
              border.</p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing"> </p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing">“Jokers climbing!” The voice of the MOP spotter was now
              on the public address system inside the Control Centre room, as tense radar
              operators looked up from their banks of computer screens at the large panel
              displays on the main wall.</p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing"> </p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing">“Altitude climbing – 4100m… 4200m… bearing direction
              south-east-east, altitude 4400m!” The voice went on, like an excited
              commentator at a soccer match before the damning proclamation hit them. “Sixteen
              Numbers Joker are in No-Fly-Zone! I repeat! Sixteen numbers Joker are in
              No-Fly-Zone!”</p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing"> </p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing">The spotter then proceeded to read out the coordinates of
              the enemy aircraft as they streaked up from the valley and soared over the
              mountain peaks. ‘No-Fly-Zone’ was the term used to describe the 10km buffer
              airspace on either side of the international border that was supposed to be
              off-limits to military air activity – as agreed upon in the Sino-Indian treaty
              signed in 1996.</p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing"> </p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing">Almost instantly, all the radar screens across the region
              registered the Chinese aircrafts and lit them up brightly as they climbed up
              and above the mountain ranges swooped out towards the border and then turned to
              fly parallel to it. Somewhere in the control centre, someone flicked open a
              guard switch and pressed an alarm button that automatically triggered sirens at
              air bases across Assam. Given the complete surprise with which the Chinese aircraft
              had breached the No-Fly-Zone, and the speed with which they were travelling,
              they would have reached the heart of Assam in a matter of mere minutes – which
              was all the time that the Base Area Defence Zones (BADZ) would have to activate
              and scramble fighters in the air. At Tezpur and Chabua air bases, pilots hopped
              into dark blue jumpsuits and then ran across the tarmac towards their waiting
              Sukhoi-30 MKI aircraft, even as maintenance personnel milled around engaged in
              a real life enactment of the aircraft scramble drill they had practiced so many
              times before.</p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing"> </p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing">Both air bases were capable of launching fighters and
              getting the first of them up to cruise altitude in under three minutes.</p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing"> </p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing">“Pair Take-off! Abandon SOP Three!” The base commander,
              Air Commodore Surinder Tyagi, seated in the air control tower at Tezpur ordered
              into his intercom.</p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing"> </p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing">Standard operating procedure (SOP) Three was the
              mandatory, but controversial, operating procedure that required a one minute
              interval between aircraft take-offs, which was intended as a precaution to
              allow dust to settle and prevent foreign objects from entering the engines of
              the Sukhoi 30 fighters. Tyagi knew that given the limited time he had right
              now, such precautionary measures were a luxury he did not possess.</p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing"> </p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing">At Shillong, it had taken two and half minutes for Air
              Marshal Ratan Mazumdar, Commander in Chief of the Eastern Air Command to reach
              the ADCC from his office. As he entered the air conditioned and darkened
              interiors of the control room, he wondered to himself how expensive those two
              and a half minutes had been in an incident that had the potential to be over
              just as soon as it had commenced. He reached his seat, at the head of the room,
              facing the large control screens.</p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing"> </p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing">An operator at the other end of the room exclaimed aloud,
              “I’ve lost contact with MOPs along the Kangto sector. Something is jamming all
              our VHF frequencies there!”</p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing"> </p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing">“Bring it up on the main screen.” Mazumdar spoke into his
              microphone calmly, “And get me a status on the Akash SAMs and how many Sukhois
              we have in the air right now.”</p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing"> </p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing">On the screen at the front end of the room, on large
              integrated panels, a map of Arunachal Pradesh was immediately brought up. Just
              north of the thick red line that represented the McMahon Line between India and
              China, was a red triangular symbol that represented the location of Nyingchi
              Mainling Airport, as well as a close bunch of red blips with tags indicating
              the current location of the Chinese J-7 fighters as they were being tracked by
              more than a dozen radars across the region. The aircrafts were flying in a loose
              formation and were extremely close to the border, flying parallel to it while
              heading in an easterly direction. Over to the west, near the border with
              Bhutan, an orange animated circular symbol popped up about twenty five
              kilometres inside Chinese territory.</p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing"> </p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing">“Receiving EW jamming signals from location Orange!” The
              operator exclaimed. “All VHF radios in that sector are down! Zero contact with
              MOPs.”</p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing"> </p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing">Mazumdar watched with increasing trepidation as the
              sensors on the ground tracking the location of the jamming signal updated
              themselves and the circle symbol moved south. There were no radar signals
              detected around it, which meant that whatever was generating the jamming signal
              was below the mountain peaks and moving very fast.</p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing"> </p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing">An aircraft mounted jammer!</p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing"> </p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing"> And one that was
              moving at low altitude rapidly towards the border. Mazumdar knew immediately
              that the initial raid of J-7 aircrafts had been a decoy, meant to cover for
              what was probably a much larger raid of much more advanced aircrafts coming in
              from the west.</p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing"> </p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing">“Get me a status on the Sukhois! Why am I not seeing any
              of our Sukhois on our screen?” He exclaimed into his microphone, the calm tone
              giving away for a moment to panic, before he steadied himself. “Where are our
              Sukhois?” </p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing"> </p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing">As if in response to him, three bright blue blips
              appeared on the screen, around Chabua Air base, as IAF Sukhoi-30-MKI aircrafts
              took to the air, and raced towards the J-7s in an intercept route. As the
              seconds ticked by the three blue blips were joined by more blips, the altitude
              figures on their tags rapidly updating as the aircraft climbed up. The area
              around Tezpur – location of the other Sukhoi 30 squadron – was still blank.</p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing"> </p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing">“Where are the hell are the Winged Arrows?” Mazumdar
              barked again, referring to the nickname of Squadron Number 2 based at Tezpur.
              “I need the Trisonics from Chabua vectored towards the Joker Seven flight, and
              the Winged Arrows have to intercept the location of the jamming signal. That
              jamming signal has to be another Chinese formation! Get me Tezpur on the video
              link immediately!”</p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing"> </p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing">Since 2009, the radars and sensors strewn across India’s
              borders with Pakistan, China and Myanmar had been linked together with a fibre
              optic based gigabyte information grid under what had been called the AFNet – a
              network that allowed command and control centres like the one Mazumdar sat in
              to receive real-time feeds from hundreds of civilian and military radar
              installations while interacting through voice and video with air bases, air
              defence batteries and even with pilots in the air. The core of this Integrated
              Air Command Control and Communication System (IACCCS) was a massive 3
              dimensional digital model of the skies over India.</p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing"> </p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing">Before the IACCCS had been set up, radars had to
              communicate with each other through microwave troposcatter communications, with
              their information being collated manually and then fed to the control room,
              before orders were orders were relayed back by the same system. The IACCCS had
              converted the earlier pyramidal information hierarchy that relied on conserving
              scarce information into a flat digital model where real-time battlefield
              information was freely available to all units on the ground and in the air.</p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing"> </p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing">But all the real time data links and radar technology
              could not counter the most important handicap – that the other side of the
              Himalayan peaks was a glaring blind spot.</p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing"> </p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing">At Tezpur, all hell had broken loose.</p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing"> </p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing">SOP-3 had ensured that the Sukhoi engines stayed clean of
              any Foreign Object Damage (FOD) when taking off for mock drills and training
              exercises – important since any damage could only be rectified by disassembling
              the engines and shipping them to Sukhoi’s service centre at Okrug, near Moscow.
              It was an operating procedure meant for training exercises, that was intended
              to be deliberately ignored in war-time. But that doctrine had not taken into
              account Murphy’s laws.</p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing"> </p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing">The first pair of aircrafts turned in from the taxi-way
              and lined up against the 150 foot wide runway, abreast of each other. As the
              launch siren rang, the aircraft on the left lurched forward, followed by the
              second aircraft barely a second later. As they barrelled down the runway and
              took off into the air,  the second pair
              of aircraft began turned in and lurched forward, the one on the left following
              the same one-second lead over the fighter on the right. Then, without warning, just
              as this pair of fighters had accelerated and reached the middle of the runway,
              the right side engine of the leading fighter sparked furiously and shot flames
              – something kicked up by the first pair of aircrafts to take off had hit it!</p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing"> </p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing">Foreign Object Damage!</p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing"> </p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing">The pilot immediately felt the engine losing power,
              amidst a cacophony of alarm lights in his cockpit and struggled to decelerate
              and control the aircraft as it began to veer towards the right – but it was too
              late.</p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing"> </p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing">As Tyagi watched in bewilderment from the control tower,
              the aircraft on the left veered slightly, then sharply, to the right before
              ramming its wing into the fighter on its side. There was a streak of flames as
              the aircrafts made contact with each other, before the two exploded in a
              blazing conflagration that completely engulfed both aircrafts, resulting in a
              massive fireball in the middle of the single runway that served the air base.
              Almost immediately, fire engines and ambulances raced out of the emergency
              services building at the other end of the base – but the damage had been done:
              Two aircrafts had been destroyed, their crews massacred in the flames and the
              runway rendered useless for at least thirty minutes.</p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing"> </p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing">“My God!” Mazumdar watched in shock at the live video
              feed from Tezpur of the burning fragmented aircrafts on the runway. He knew
              most of the pilots who were based in Tezpur on a personal basis, and the shock
              of seeing some of them get massacred so brutally jolted him for a moment. But
              then, regaining this composure, he looked at this operators and issued his next
              order.</p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing"> </p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing">“Have the Mig-27s at Hasimara scramble right now!”</p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing"> </p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing">Hasimara air base was located in West Bengal and was the
              nearest air base with a squadron of fighter jets capable to intercepting the
              Chinese intrusion. The other air bases at Jorhat and Guwahati comprised only
              transport aircraft. And while Tezpur was only 120 km south of the border where
              the Chinese aircraft were expected to turn up, the Mig-27 fighters at Hasimara
              would have to fly over 350km over Bhutan to reach the area – a pointless task
              since any Chinese aircraft would reach Tezpur long before they even crossed
              Bhutan.</p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing"> </p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing">And then as the pulsating orange circle representing the
              location of the jamming signal reached the No-Fly-Zone and climbed altitude,
              the radar screens lit up with too many red blips to count.</p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing"> </p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing">Advance units on the ground that were able to communicate
              through the AFNet reported in terse tones, “Twenty five plus numbers Abdul – no
              wait – Abdul -Beta – are over No-Fly-Zone!”</p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing"> </p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing">Abdul Beta was the code name assigned to the brand new
              Chinese J-10B fighters – which as a 4.5 generation fighter were equal to the
              Su-30MKIs in terms of technology as compared to the J-7 fighters.</p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing"> </p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing">A hushed gasp went around the control room. Even if all
              25 SU30-MKIs from Tezpur had been scrambled, the J-10Bs would have posed more
              than a challenge for them, their advanced avionics and on board missiles giving
              them almost a level playing field against the Sukhois in a close up dogfight. And
              now with Tezpur put out of action by the air crash on the runway, it was going
              to be up to the Akash SAM batteries on the ground to counter the enemy
              aircraft. The only drawback in this was that the SAM batteries had limited
              range and had been designed to provide only ‘point-defence’ for small and
              important areas like air bases and missile installations.</p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing"> </p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing">In the absence of any credible fighters in the air, the
              Chinese could fly around Arunachal Pradesh and Assam with impunity, coming under
              attack from ground bases defences only if they ventured too close to an air
              base.</p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing"> </p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing">“Rohini and Rajendra are tracking bandits!” One of the
              radar operators spoke into his microphone.</p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing"> </p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing">‘Rohini’ was the Central Acquisition Radar (CAR) located
              at Tezpur and at Chabua that formed the back bone of the ground defences around
              the air bases there, and which was capable of tracking more than a hundred
              targets simultaneously. ‘Rajendra’ were the smaller target guidance radars
              attached to the Rohini that would track individual targets and then guide
              surface to air missiles to them. “Akash batteries are ready to launch as soon
              as bandits come in range.” But the intercept range of the Akash missiles was
              only 30kms, and they would not launch unless the Chinese aircraft came close
              enough to the air bases they protected.</p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing"> </p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing">Mazumdar gripped the arm rest of his chair and watched
              both groups of red blips on the radars as they moved slowly in a south east
              direction over Arunachal Pradesh, the few blue blips south of them in East
              Assam looking woefully inadequate in comparison. He wondered to himself whether
              the Chinese would really risk a whole squadron of their best aircraft in what
              could turn out into a completely suicidal raid on Tezpur or Chabua air bases,
              and whether the Chinese were actually looking for a dogfight with the Sukhois
              in the skies over Assam.</p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing"> </p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing">Most of all he wondered what the whole Chinese attack was
              about. He had been following news reports covering the Beijing University
              bombing over the past weeks, and had heard about the shootout at Guiyang
              earlier that day, and somewhere at the back of his mind, the idea began to rear
              itself that this was probably China’s retaliation for what it perceived as
              Indian sponsored acts of terrorism.</p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing"> </p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing">Somewhere on the left flank of the control room, a group
              of telephone operators were already placing calls to the Prime Minister’s
              Office, the defence ministry and to the Indian army’s control centre. Air
              headquarters in New Delhi would have already been appraised of the situation
              over the AFNet, but there were still critical organizations that had to be
              informed the old fashioned way – with a telephone call.</p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing"> </p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing">Meanwhile over the skies over Assam and Arunachal
              Pradesh, the Sukhoi30s taking off from Chabua came into formation as they
              headed north and immediately registered the J-7 squadron ahead of them on their
              powerful Panther radars which had a range of more than 200kms. In contrast the
              FIAR Grifo-7 radars on board the J-7s had a limited range of less than 60kms.
              The primitive radar would have made them practically blind in the face of the
              Sukhois, had it not been for the presence of a Chinese AWACS – an air-borne
              radar – that circled the skies far north of the McMahon line, feeding them with
              a clear picture of their surroundings, and of the Sukhoi squadron’s location
              and bearing.</p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing"> </p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing"> As the Sukhois
              climbed altitude, their radars lit up the valleys and peaks beyond the McMahon
              line – which had been hidden from ground based radars. The resulting feed was
              immediately reflected on the large panel displays in the Control Room in
              Shillong, and drew more gasps from the exasperated operators there.</p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing"> </p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing">In addition to the two groups of red blips now moving
              over Arunachal Pradesh, the Panther radars were now registering another group
              of red blips moving along the valley floor from Langxian, some 100km west of
              Nyingchi Mainling Airport. The Identification Friend or Foe (IFF) software took
              barely a second to identify the radar signatures and display the description of
              the new group of red blips. ’15X, SU27-UBK, NATO desig: Flanker’, the AFNet computer
              tagged the group of blips with a label, listing their altitude and bearing
              alongside. The Sukhoi-27 jet fighter was almost the equal of the Mig-29s that
              the IAF operated, and coupled with the J-7s further south, placed the Trisonics
              Squadron approaching from Chabua at a fatal disadvantage. As soon as the Su-27
              squadron laying low in the valley floor detected the radars of the Sukhoi-30s,
              they climbed altitude rapidly, coming up above the highest mountain peaks and
              into full glare of the Indian ground radars on the other side of the border.</p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing"> </p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing">Two of the 15 Su-27s, which had been packed with on-board
              electronic jamming and scrambling equipment came forward and climbed further up
              than the other aircrafts, and immediately began to throw the Indian ground
              radars out of action. Except for the few Israeli ELM mobile radars that had
              been recently deployed, the older Soviet era radars immediately went blank
              under the intense electronic scrambling, leaving the job of tracking the enemy
              to the THD1955 at Shillong and to the EW-proof on-board radars of the Su30s.
              But even these came under pressure as they rapidly changed their operating
              frequencies to evade the electronic jamming.</p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing"> </p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing">If this was the Chinese air invasion that everyone had
              been predicting for several years now, then the PLAAF was going to completely
              overwhelm the Indian air defences and lay waste to North East India tonight,
              Mazumdar thought to himself. And with nothing more than a single squadron of
              fighters, a jammed radar network and a few air defence batteries at scattered
              locations, he was completely powerless to stop it. And if there already were so
              many aircraft in the air, Mazumdar wondered how far behind was the massive
              missile barrage that had always been expected to prelude a Chinese attack.</p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing"> </p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing">Then, just as Mazumdar was mulling over whether to throw
              the Su30s into a raging bloodbath against the Chinese or to pull them back out
              of harm’s way, the situation suddenly changed.</p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing"> </p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing">The J-7 squadron that had been heading in a south east
              direction, parallel to the border, changed direction and began to fly east,
              parallel to the McMahon line, and then, even as two tense minutes ticked by turned
              further to head north-east, and began to move up the screen, and back towards
              Chinese airspace. Mazumdar would have guessed this as a feint move, allowing
              them to move out of the intercept route with the approaching Su-30s and
              allowing the Su-27s further north to move in. But the Su-27s also began to turn
              north back into Chinese territory. The PLAAF aircraft here were definitely
              turning back and heading home before they could come within range of the Su-30
              squadron.</p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing"> </p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing">Further west, the J10B squadron that had been threatening
              to fly almost unchallenged over Indian airspace, also began to turn north and
              back home. In five minutes it became clear that the Chinese air intrusion had
              been a carefully planned move designed to intimidate the Indian Air Force and
              send through a threatening message, and which had been pulled back well in time
              to avoid coming into range of the Indian Su-30s.</p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing"> </p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing">Across North East India, radar operators and commanders
              who had been sweating through the palms of their hands, heaved a sigh of relief
              and relaxed, as the clusters of red blips began to move back up north, and even
              as the ground radar pickets began to re-boot in the absence of the electronic
              scrambling that had blinded them a minute ago. In the east, the Trisonics were
              diverted from their intercept path and were re-routed along an air patrol route
              along the border, scanning the Chinese side for low altitude threats, while the
              Mig-27s from Hasimara who were still halfway over Bhutan were ordered to cover
              their side of the border in a similar role.</p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing"> </p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing">In Shillong, Air Marshal Ratan Mazumdar sat limp in his
              seat and nervously wiped the sweat off his forehead. What had been an extremely
              close shave for the Air Force had also revealed its complete inability to deal
              with what the Chinese could possibly throw at it. A strong and long-time
              advocate for modernization and increased spending for the Air Force, Mazumdar
              realized that – nerve wrecking as it had been – the incident had to now be
              analysed, and its findings used to convince the government that far more had to
              be done in North-East India to safeguard India’s freedom here.</p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing"> </p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing">Next time around, he thought as he looked at receding red
              blips on the screens before him, would be for real, and that was a disaster
              that the Air Force had to prepare for.</p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing"> </p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing">Next time, he would be ready for them!</p>
