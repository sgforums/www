              <p>interesting.</p>
              <p>i thought the trend was to go into ULF sonar or VLF sonar arrays
                          ? strategypage has an interesting articles about heavyweight
                          torpedos today.</p>
              <p>apparently no modern wire guided torpedo has been fired since
                          wwII if you take the strategypage article seriouslly and dont count
                          the USS Scorpion.</p>
              <p>i'd like to add it has to do with the salinity of the water and
                          the various thermoinclines. hardware will only take you so far.
                          under the cooler and denser (supposedly more saline layer), the sub
                          is more quieter than one which is in the warmer and less dense
                          thermoincline layer (im not too sure on this, my knowledge of this
                          is pretty vague)</p>
              <p>anyone knows what are the thermoinclines for our waters ? our
                          Sjoormens/Vastergotlands were adapted and Tropicalized to adapt for
                          our waters right ?or was it more of a install air-conditioning for
                          warmer waters in singapore vs cold baltic waters ?</p>
              <p>what about the indonesian Kilos and Malaysian Scorpenes ? are
                          they adapted too ? ATM RTN has no submarine vessels right ?</p>

              <p>sg waters are too shallow to have thermoclines which is layer of distinct change in water temperature (and sometimes even temperature inversion).</p>
              <p>Both salinity, density and temperature of water has large effects on the speed of sound travels under water.  It is possible to mask a submarine's presence by dodging below the layer because of the change in the speed of sound at the layer causes the sound to be largely contained to one side of it. </p>
              <p>To investigagte POSSUB contacts in such an evironment will require sonobouys to be dropped at depths both above and below the layer, hence making it more tedious. </p>
              <p>The problem with Active Sonar is that everybody know's you're in the neighborhood, the fairly large neighborhood. Most submarines have active-intercept arrays that tell them the bearing of the Active sonar ping, and can relay such information to their surface counter parts or fleet intelligence.   </p>
              <p>With 2 or 3 other submarines just sitting around, a fleet that goes around active-pinging at ghosts will allow the enemy to triangulate their positions and heading easily.  Hence active sonar isn't the solution to the submarine problem. </p>

              <p>As for this page -&gt; <span style="color: #333333; font-size: 14px; line-height: 16px;">http://www.fas.org/man/congress/1997/h970318n.htm</span></p>
              <p>The information there is almost 11 years old and slightly dated to the point of inaccurate.  Would appreciate if you have more current information.</p>
              <p>The USN Improved LA class Subs have already gained abilities deploy underwater mines (gps guided) as well as UUVs (unmanned under water vehicles) as off-ship sensors.  </p>
              <p>Of course, this is not to say the Russians aren't keeping up.</p>
              <p>3 new classes of Russian submarines to look out for:  The Amur (SSK export name Lada), Borei (SSBN) and  the Graney (i think...).  The Graney might actually be a smoke screen for another SSN that may supersede the Akula II.  The class name popped up over the net some time ago but I can't seem to recall it for the life of me.  </p>
              <p>Still, the Kilos and Akulas (I and IIs) were relatively successful and are now heading for the export market.  It seems that the Russians have something better coming up. </p>

              <p>There's a lot of research going into sonar-armed UUVs. Basically, these unmanned vessels will scout around. If they trigger an attack from enemy subs, then asw assets can focus on the attack area. Kinda like UAVs do with SAMs. Also much better than static hydrophone lines as the patrolling area is flexible.</p>

              <p>Ah.. you forget a few things. There's no reliable IFF that exists underwater, nor is there a viable long range communication system.  Short range is possible, but you must know where the other submarine is. In fact, friendly fire incidents between submarines is quite possible. Also, there's no way that a ship can possibly travel quietly. Propellors near the surface generate too much cavitation and noise. There's also the option of having a wave following sensor which the Russians have.</p>
              <p>Active sonar on the other hand provides high resolution acoustic images. Something passive cannot achieve right now.</p>

              <p>No thats not true at all.  In fact, an sonar echo return from an active sonar only tells you there is an object there, IF it even returns an echo.  Active Sonars faces severe limitations in littoral evironments and even open oceans where thermocline layers can reflect active sonar pulses.</p>
              <p>An Active Sonar does not serve in any purpose as an IFF.  Passive Sonar does that when we do blade count analysis, Turns Per Knot, and frequency analysis of engine noises etc.  Correct me if I'm mistaken, another problem with Active Sonar is that it transmits over long distances, but the echo returns attenuate easily and is lost over a considerable short distance.</p>
              <p>Wave homing technology is not reliable at best.  Towed Decoys have demonstrated to be effective in spoofing wave-homing torpedoes.  There are several other countermeasures as well.  </p>

              <p><br>Just curious Fingolfin_noldor, not too sure if i m right on this</p>
              <p>if you are saying that passive sonar technology has plateaued and the new developmental trends are in active sonar or ultra low frequency active phased arrays.</p>
              <p>then why do destroyer doctrines focus on rabid active pinging of a sea area to hunt for subs and subs focus on passive sonar for detection and hunting of surface fleets and subsurface combatants ? the sub stays passive to avoid detection from surface and potential protector subs.</p>
              <p>to suggest that subs are using active sonar to search and detect enemy surface and subsurface combatants seems like a complete abandonment of the traditional hunter-killer sub doctrine ?</p>
              <p>instead of stealth and hunt, now you have an active, create a helluva lot of noise and draw attention to yourself hunt ? its turning classic anti sub doctrine on its head isnt it ?</p>
              <p>this is the bit i dont understand. seems to conflict with what little i know about sub hunting doctrines.</p>
              <p>unless u mean the new type low frequency active sonars cannot be detected by other combatants in the area (surface or subsurface). but surely the target that is being pinged, can identify the general direction and threat in the area ?</p>

              <p>No thats not true at all.  In fact, an sonar echo return
              from an active sonar only tells you there is an object there, IF it
              even returns an echo.  Active Sonars faces severe limitations
              in littoral evironments and even open oceans where thermocline
              layers can reflect active sonar pulses.</p>
              <p>An Active Sonar does not serve in any purpose as an IFF.
               Passive Sonar does that when we do blade count analysis,
              Turns Per Knot, and frequency analysis of engine noises etc.
               Correct me if I'm mistaken, another problem with Active Sonar
              is that it transmits over long distances, but the echo returns
              attenuate easily and is lost over a considerable short
              distance.</p>
              <p>Wave homing technology is not reliable at best.  Towed
              Decoys have demonstrated to be effective in spoofing wave-homing
              torpedoes.  There are several other countermeasures as well.

              <p>I never said Active Sonar ever served as an IFF. How do you suggest using a Passive sonar to detect anything if a skilled Submarine captain chooses to go into his silent mode? Passive sonar is only as useful as the sensitivity and how stupid the submarine crew in question, and because of the increasing level of quietness, the USN has resorted to working on active sonar again. Norman Polmar explicitly stated that the USN has to revamp its entire detection paradigm.</p>
              <p>Let's take a look at this sonar system: <a href="http://www.globalsecurity.org/intell/systems/lfa.htm">http://www.globalsecurity.org/intell/systems/lfa.htm</a></p>
              <p>This sonar system was installed on the USN's small fleet of ocean surveillance vessels. It is meant to operate alongside the SURTASS passive system.</p>
              <p>Note these paragraphs:</p>
              <blockquote>
              <p> <span style="color: #000000; font-family: Arial; font-size: 12px; line-height: normal;">The U.S. Navy plans to deploy a new submarine detection system, known as Low Frequency Active Sonar (LFA), throughout 80% of the world's oceans. LFA is based on the fact that very low frequency sound [100-1000 Hz] can travel great distances and detect quiet submarines. The LFA system uses intense sound, reportedly [the Navy has given a figure of 160 dB at about 2 km from the LFA] at levels in the range of 235 decibels or greater [the noise level of a jet engine is about 120 dB] generated by massive sound transmitters towed behind TAGOS-class ships.</span></p>
              <span style="color: #000000; font-family: Arial; font-size: 12px; line-height: normal;">
              <p style="margin-top: 10px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 15px; margin-left: 0px;">Current passive SURTASS towed array sonars are limited in their capability to detect quiet submarines. Thus research has been going on for some time in the area of low frequency active (LFA) towed array sonar. LFA offers the potential for TAGOS ships to make longer range detections of quiet submarines.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 10px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 15px; margin-left: 0px;">The shallow-water acoustics problem has risen in importance due to the increased salience of regional conflicts where the US Navy may to encounter slow, diesel submarines close to shore. The shallow-water, slow submarine is significantly more difficult to detect and classify acoustically than the cold war threat, due to the complex propagation, high clutter, and low target Doppler. Effective sonar performance requires new processing algorithms which cannot be implemented on current Naval platforms due the high processing requirements. A Hybrid Digital/Optical Processor (HyDOP) is to demonstrate the feasibility of using embedded scalable high performance digital and optical processing to solve this problem. This requires application of computationally intensive algorithms which cannot be implemented in real time using conventional processors. A high-speed optical correlator being developed by the Naval Research Laboratory (NRL) will act as a coprocessor to an Intel Paragon XP/S-25 computer.</p>
              </span></blockquote>
              <p>The TAGOS ships by the way, is probably the most capable vessels when it comes to detecting submarines. They are as large as a large frigate, and they don't carry anything else beyond the sonar and the processing computers. You can read more of the system in question here:</p>

              <p>I'm not saying that passive sonar is altogether useless, but in this day of age, you use every single tool available to detect incoming threats. Of course there's still the option of using ASROC if all things fail...</p>

              <p><br> Just curious Fingolfin_noldor, not too sure if i m right on
              this</p>
              <p>if you are saying that passive sonar technology has plateaued
              and the new developmental trends are in active sonar or ultra low
              frequency active phased arrays.</p>
              <p>then why do destroyer doctrines focus on rabid active pinging of
              a sea area to hunt for subs and subs focus on passive sonar for
              detection and hunting of surface fleets and subsurface combatants ?
              the sub stays passive to avoid detection from surface and potential
              protector subs.</p>
              <p>to suggest that subs are using active sonar to search and detect
              enemy surface and subsurface combatants seems like a complete
              abandonment of the traditional hunter-killer sub doctrine ?</p>
              <p>instead of stealth and hunt, now you have an active, create a
              helluva lot of noise and draw attention to yourself hunt ? its
              turning classic anti sub doctrine on its head isnt it ?</p>
              <p>this is the bit i dont understand. seems to conflict with what
              little i know about sub hunting doctrines.</p>
              <p>unless u mean the new type low frequency active sonars cannot be
              detected by other combatants in the area (surface or subsurface).
              but surely the target that is being pinged, can identify the
              general direction and threat in the area ?</p>
              </div>
              </blockquote>
              <p>I believe there's still work done on passive arrays, but there's certainly more work on active arrays done these days than before. No, submarines will not go active since it will compromise their stealth. Ships on the other hand, especially when you are talking about the average destroyer/frigate and not those corvettes that may come with water jets etc. to minimize their noise profile (though how much is another thing), have a lot fewer options and they need to maximise their abilities to detect submarines. To do that, you have to resort to developing new technologies that can do the trick. Though I have heard of Russian acheonic coatings that try to reduce the reflection of active sonar.</p>

              <p>China license produces Kilos? That's new to me. I thought the Russians still is the sole producer of the Kilo. Though I won't be surprised if the Chinese modified them. There are a few variants of the Kilos. The last variant had some new modifications that make it even quieter. The newer Lada class/Amur is said to be even quieter.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I'm not too sure about the Japanese (too much classified stuff out there really) but the Japanese ought to make top notch submarines. The latest class has AIP as well. The Collins class if I remember reading is based on the latest Swedish designs fitted with an American combat management system. Supposedly the Australians (if I am not wrong) produced their own sonar system (they are apparently quite good at it) though with other US/British components thrown into the mix. Maybe I can find some info on it digging through Janes (which isn't the best source out there, really)</p>

              <p>Actually, on another forum, some analyst fella (who has shown to be quite knowledgeable in a lot things, though he shuts up on certain issues immediately), he pointed out that incident possibly really wasn't orchestrated. For one thing, the submarine captain has a few options.</p>
              <p>1. He can hightail out of there and risk getting detected and shot at.</p>
              <p>2. Drift away in hope that he can get out of there quietly (which is doubtful since Chinese made subs are still not up to spec really). I would say that this might be a possible action but I don't know too much of the technical details. But, you might note that he was probably running to the limit of his submarine's endurance and might not be able to get of there quietly.</p>
              <p>3. Surface and say, "Sorry for the intrusion. Let us get some oxygen and we will be on our way."</p>
              <p>Of course, the real story might be really they planned to do that, but the submarine in question has no AIP and thus have no endurance for that sort of thing. They also must know the precise location of the Kitty Hawk battlegroup as well. I might be totally wrong of course.</p>
              <p>Personally, I don't see China too much of a threat to the USN until the USN goes close to the shore or through some narrow chokepoint at the moment. Neither will they be a threat to us in the near future. However, if China finally gets its nuclear submarine force up to the level where the Russians have gotten to (which is really a decade or so away), then they will give us trouble. For now, well, just buy what we get hold of and either hope China doesn't give a damn about us.</p>
              <p>Though I sure hope they aren;'t overspending. Seems to me that the rate at which they are acquiring new vessels is really fast.</p>

              <p>Its not disturbing that China's doing this.  The Russians and Americans used to shadow each other with submarines all a long.  Its disturbing that the Chinese aren't talking about it and being transparent about their intentions and capabilities.  IMO, this casts a long of doubts and suspicions on the Chinese even if they claim that their intentions are peaceful.  </p>
              <p>From the little that I know, Active Sonar is used for a few purposes.  To scare away subs for one ("Carpet Bombing").  Another, to gain detail on where the very quiet sub ( u're sure its SOMEWHERE there) but highly elusive to what depth he's at.</p>
              <p>Anyway, theres a lot of technical detail and operational details we don't know about how submarines carry out business.  From what I understand, the edge now is with the submarines as long as they have accurate intelligence of who and what is where at when.  There's no single passive or active solution to hunting submarines.  Knowledge, efficiency, and experience aka "a good hunch" is necessary.</p>
