The first of class, the Seawolf (SSN21), was ordered from the Electric Boat Division of General Dynamics, Connecticut, in January 1989 and commissioned in July 1997. Connecticut (SSN22) was commissioned in December 1998. The third, Jimmy Carter (SSN 23), is to be modified to improve payload carrying and underwater manoeuvrability. The alterations to the design will include modifications to the ballast control, mission management spaces and the creation of a flexible ocean interface known as a "wasp waist", which will enable the deployment and recovery of payloads without the use of torpedo tubes. Other additions include a new high capacity communications mast and ROV handling system. The Jimmy Carter was launched in June 2004 and commissioned in February 2005. </span></p>

With the end of the Cold War and the change of emphasis to littoral operations, the cost of the Seawolf submarines was judged prohibitive and the programme was curtailed in favour of the smaller and cheaper Virginia Class New Attack submarines.</span></p>

A TAINS (Tercom Aided Inertial Navigation System) guides the missile towards the target flying at subsonic speed at an altitude of 20m to 100m. Tomahawk can be fitted with a nuclear warhead which is not normally carried. Block III improvements include an improved propulsion system and Navstar Global Positioning System (GPS) guidance capability. The anti-ship Tomahawk missile is equipped with an inertial guidance and an active radar and anti-radiation homing head. The range is up to 450km. </span></p>

              <p>And the same fate will soon befall the F-35. The F-35 in some cases is more expensive than the F-22. I blame the military contractors for leaching and the Pentagon for fickle-mindedness.</p>
              <p>See the problem is that the morons decided to spend more money to design a new submarine from ground up. Granted a lot of technology issues were solved, but a new submarine presents new engineering challenges. By the same token, the F-35 simply resulted in more duplicated spending because 1. new competition, new funds required, 2. New challenges because the Marines annally demanded VTOL 3. Those damn cost overruns again. The end result was an aircraft that though might be slightly more advanced than the F-22 in certain areas, lags in the end because of a lack of supercruise, radar aperture is slightly smaller thus inferior, slightly smaller bombload etc. and now a nice huge price tag that wobbles around because it hinges on allies not changing their minds on buying the aircraft.</p>

              <p>yeap, but there wasnt any replacement for the sturgeon class, so the task fell upon the Sea wolf to fulfill elint/ intelligence as well.</p>
              <p>wikipedia states that 1 ship out of the three sea wolf class has been modified to carry SEALs and has a longer hull by 30m  (100ft)</p>
              <p>i wonder if its really 1 ship out of the class of 3 or all 3 ships.</p>

              <p>Says who? Even the Americans have been careful about disclosing any of their weaknesses. The public estimate is the Akula I alone if I am not wrong is as good/nearly as the 688I if not better. Also, it is not so much a matter of who is extremely quieter than who now, but whether the submarine captain is smart enough to utilize his submarine effectively. All submarines have a silent cruise speed and when stalking the prey, no submarine captain will breach that speed but rather stay below that. High silent speeds are of course useful but by no means a definite game changer. The Russians have for the last few decades worked pretty hard to match the West and they have quite a few innovations. For example, they have one torpedo that has two stages and can be launched from a few tens of kilometers before striking the enemy ship, thereby keeping the submarine as far away from the enemy vessel.</p>
              <p>At this point of time, it has come down to a game of tactics. Russian submarine reactors now have an air-circulation mode similar to that of the Ohio submarines (and no doubt the Seawolf). They can be damn bloody quiet when they want to be. It should be telling that the trend is heading towards a towed active sonar array in part to look for diesel subs but also nuclear submarines as well.</p>

              <p>anyone knows what are the thermoinclines for our waters ? our Sjoormens/Vastergotlands were adapted and Tropicalized to adapt for our waters right ?or was it more of a install air-conditioning for warmer waters in singapore vs cold baltic waters ?</p>

              <p>Says who? Even the Americans have been careful about disclosing
              any of their weaknesses. The public estimate is the Akula I alone
              if I am not wrong is as good/nearly as the 688I if not better.
              Also, it is not so much a matter of who is extremely quieter than
              who now, but whether the submarine captain is smart enough to
              utilize his submarine effectively. All submarines have a silent
              cruise speed and when stalking the prey, no submarine captain will
              breach that speed but rather stay below that. High silent speeds
              are of course useful but by no means a definite game changer. The
              Russians have for the last few decades worked pretty hard to match
              the West and they have quite a few innovations. For example, they
              have one torpedo that has two stages and can be launched from a few
              tens of kilometers before striking the enemy ship, thereby keeping
              the submarine as far away from the enemy vessel.</p>
              <p>At this point of time, it has come down to a game of tactics.
              Russian submarine reactors now have an air-circulation mode similar
              to that of the Ohio submarines (and no doubt the Seawolf). They can
              be damn bloody quiet when they want to be. It should be telling
              that the trend is heading towards a towed active sonar array in
              part to look for diesel subs but also nuclear submarines as
              well.</p>

              <p>I was referring to the Akula II's ability to detect, hence detection capabilities.  Its been long acknowledged that Russians have been building very quiet and capable boats.  However, last I heard anything about this (hence I am a little out of date), is that the Americans still had better sonars and other forms of detection methods.</p>
              <p>Its not just about towed sonar arrays, but the quality of the hydrophones and acoustics analysis capabilities as well.  </p>
