            <div class='col-md body'>I am sure that the defence budget is always more than what they have announced to the public. I strongly suspect that there are funds for black projects such as in the US, hidden somewhere, maybe in the funds allocated to other areas,perhaps.What do you think? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>New jets probably factored in previous budgets. Maybe R&amp;D and more overseas training. We surely not the only ones curious.<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"><br>Feb 23, 2005<br>Total defence lies in public participation<br><br>By Dr Azmi Hassan<br><br>IT IS not surprising for the Singapore Armed Forces to own sophisticated and formidable military weaponry as the Singapore Government allocates a huge budget for defence.<br><br>For example, the SAF's capabilities are said to be the most efficient in the Asia Pacific region because the weaponry it owns, like the fighter jets and helicopters, are of the best class.<br><br>Singapore spends between 4 and 5 per cent of its gross domestic product (GDP) annually on defence. This is a huge budget for a country which is only 648 sq km in size, and which lies in a region regarded as peaceful because it is surrounded by neighbours who dislike hostility.<br><br>Malaysia allocates between 2 and 3 per cent of its GDP for defence, but relatively speaking, Singapore's defence expenditure is usually four times bigger.<br><br>It is not an exaggeration to say that, in terms of military equipment for the army, navy and air force, what the SAF owns is far better than what the Malaysian Armed Forces owns.<br><br>Undeniably, if Malaysia allocates up to RM25 billion (S$10.8 billion) annually for defence, just like Singapore, the MAF's sophisticated weaponry would surely match the SAF's.<br><br>Currently, Malaysia allocates only between RM6 billion and RM7 billion annually to defence.<br><br>Another interesting point is the defence concept Singapore practises - that is, how every issue Singapore faces is instilled in its people's mind as issues and as challenges to their defence and sovereignty.<br><br>The concept practised by Singaporeans appears to have succeeded as the message conveyed to the public that they should always be on guard has been very effective overall.<br><br>Therefore, Singaporeans are not bothered when some people describe them as very kiasu as this attitude suits their Total Defence concept.<br><br>Singapore has been practising this strategy since 1984. It is included in its security concept and is called Total Defence. In fact, every Feb 15 is Total Defence Day, and on this day, Singaporeans are reminded that they should always be prepared to face challenges.<br><br>The date was picked to mark Feb 15, 1942 - the day Singapore fell to the Japanese army during World War II.<br><br>The choice of the date was deemed as most appropriate as it suits the message intended to be conveyed - that is, bitter history should not repeat itself.<br><br>When the issue of overlapping claims over Pulau Batu Putih is seen from the Singaporeans' defence and sovereignty angle, it is not something strange because Malay- sians also view this likewise, as the issue is indeed closely related to defence and sovereignty matters.<br><br>It is also not surprising for Singaporeans to feel that talks with Malaysia on the water supply price is a national defence and sovereignty issue because Total Defence practises this strategy.<br><br>In fact, it is not an exaggeration to assume that whenever issues involving Malaysia or other neighbours surface, Singaporeans would perceive all these as being linked to their defence and sovereignty problem.<br><br>So great is the impact and role of Singapore's Total Defence.<br><br>The phrase, 'a tiny red dot', which former Indonesian president B. J. Habibie used in 1998, still haunts Singaporeans as the words were uttered to belittle Singapore as a small country surrounded by bigger countries, like Malaysia and Indonesia.<br><br>For a head of state whose country's population is many times larger than Singapore's to issue such a statement would definitely leave a deep impact on Singaporeans.<br><br>Mr Lee Hsien Loong was deputy prime minister then, and he said the comment stigmatised Singaporeans by implying how small and weak they are.<br><br>However, Singaporeans overcame the stigma prudently by turning the humiliating comment into a Total Defence Programme, which painted the picture that though Singapore is indeed a 'tiny red dot', it is one strong entity if all Singaporeans are united.<br><br>Now, Singapore primary schools capitalise on the effect of the 'tiny red dot' stigma as teaching materials for their students.<br><br>Therefore, when Taiwanese Foreign Minister Mark Chen gave Singapore a name in a language that is not appropriate to be mentioned and published but also implied the same thing as 'tiny red dot', Singapore's leaders and its people could handle the issue well.<br><br>Although the SAF does not have as many military personnel as the MAF, by practising the Total Defence concept, it appears that all four million Singaporeans will always have a role to play in safeguarding their national security and sovereignty.<br><br>All the modern and sophisticated weaponry a country owns would become useless if its people have a carefree and non-committal attitude when faced with defence and security issues.<br><br>The Total Defence concept practised by Singapore truly fulfils its defence doctrine, which gives priority to a defence strategy that encompasses every aspect of its people's lifestyle.<br><br>By practising this concept, the Singapore Government can make decisions very easily without encountering objections because every action that it takes is based on Singapore's national defence and sovereign interests.<br><br>Some Singaporeans feel that choosing Feb 15 to celebrate Total Defence is no longer appropriate as present-day threats are totally different compared to the time of World War II.<br><br>Nevertheless, the concept, which is imbued through this programme, is totally appropriate as the current threat, which is borderless terrorism, can be destroyed only through total public participation and not through sophisticated military weaponry.<br><br>The writer is associate professor with the Universiti Teknologi Malaysia.

            <div class='col-md body'>Singapore Increases Defense Budget By 7.4 Percent<br>By AGENCE FRANCE-PRESSE, SINGAPORE<br><br>SingaporeÂ’s military was the big winner in the national budget, unveiled Feb. 18 with defense spending for the next financial year slated to grow by 7.4 percent, to 9.26 billion Singapore dollars ($5.8 billion.<br><br>The defense outlay accounts for 31.2 percent of the 29.68-billion-dollar national budget for the fiscal year ending March 2006 that Prime Minister and Finance Minister Lee Hsien Loong unveiled before parliament.<br><br>The defense ministry has the biggest share of spending among all government ministries, and the 7.4 percent increase was well above the 1.6 percent rise in the overall expenditure.<br><br>Together with the home affairs ministry and the ministry of foreign affairs, security and external relations accounts for 40.1 percent, or 11.90 billion dollars, of the proposed national budget.<br><br>The education ministry has the next biggest share of the budget, with 20 percent.<br><br>Budget papers released to the media said a bulk of the defense ministryÂ’s operating expenditure will go to salaries and allowances for service personnel, maintenance of equipment and camps, and the purchase of military equipment.<br><br>Lee also announced a 3 percent budget cut for all ministries except defense, on top of a 2 percent cut announced in last yearÂ’s budget which defense was also excluded from.<br><br>The ministriesÂ’ overall expenditure will still increase marginally because their budgets are a percentage of gross domestic product, which grew by 8.4 percent in the 2004 calendar year.<br><br>Singapore, a tiny Southeast Asian island-nation surrounded by bigger neighbors, already has one of AsiaÂ’s best equipped land, sea and air forces, and defense has traditionally soaked up more of the budget than other ministries.<br><br>Apart from a modern, high-tech army, the Singapore Armed Forces also has four submarines, a fleet of transport helicopters and planes, landing ships, tanks and warships.<br><br>The government is expected to announce this year its choice of modern fighter jets to replace a squadron of its aging Skyhawk planes in a deal worth around one billion U.S. dollars.<br><br>The Singapore Armed ForcesÂ’ transport capabilities were put to heavy use for humanitarian relief in neighboring Indonesia after the December 26 tsunami disaster, in the city-stateÂ’s biggest military deployment since independence.<br><br>According to the budget statement, the defense ministryÂ’s mission is to Â“enhance SingaporeÂ’s peace and security, and should deterrence and diplomacy fail, to secure a swift and decisive victoryÂ” over any aggressor.<br><br>The budget also includes financing for enhanced security measures carried out by the home affairs ministry to deter terrorist attacks.<br></div>
