              <p>.<strong>Original pages in SSW of STechnology in
                                      2005</strong></p>
              <blockquote>
              <p>"The SSW was conceptualised specifically for military operations
                                      in urban terrain (MOUT). Although the idea of a dual calibre weapon
                                      is not new, ST Kinetics' SSW is the only infantry weapon developed
                                      in Asia with a Fire Control System (FCS) that fires next generation
                                      programmable ammunition like the 40mm Air Bursting Munition (ABM)
                                      directly from a handheld system. Weighing only 6kg with a full load
                                      4 x 40mm rounds and 20 x 5.7mm rounds, the SSW is hassle-free,
                                      intuitive to use, and short and light enough to be carried and
                                      efficiently deployed by individual soldiers even in confined
                                      spaces.<br> <br> Improved Lethality<br> The SSW has a built-in miniaturised FCS for better accuracy,
                                      reliability and improved probability of a first time hit. The FCS
                                      features advanced electronics to ensure quick target acquisition
                                      and accurate delivery of fire. It helps the user to compute the
                                      range using a laser range finder, and programmes ammunition quickly
                                      and accurately. It is designed with an automatic ammunition
                                      recognition device to help overcome any human errors that might
                                      compromise safety and reliability.<br> <br> In its grenade launcher mode, ST Kinetics' SSW fires existing 40mm
                                      low velocity and a new medium velocity round, ABM and conventional
                                      grenades. Medium velocity rounds offer users a longer range.
                                      Coupled with an FCS, it also offers increased accuracy. This offers
                                      an unprecedented lethality in personal defence weapons.<br> <br> With an ABM capability built into a handheld system, soldiers are
                                      now equipped with greater lethality to overcome targets located in
                                      areas such as rooftops or windows beyond the reaches of
                                      conventional ammunition. The ABM is particularly effective where
                                      targets are situated in difficult or closed terrain such as bunkers
                                      and caves, as evidenced in recent world conflicts.<br> <br> With its capacity for four ready 40mm rounds in the SSW, soldiers
                                      can now operate with increased confidence knowing that they can
                                      engage their targets quickly and effectively without needing to
                                      re-load after each shot. The SSW offers a high rate of grenade
                                      fire, and can operate in a single shot or semi-automatic mode for a
                                      more permanent and lethal effect. This is a crucial feature for
                                      fleeting targets in urban warfare.<br> <br> In grenade launcher mode, the SSW has an effective range of up to
                                      500m, depending on the type of ammunition selected.<br> <br> Personal Defence Weapon<br> As a personal defence weapon, the SSW is customised for smaller and
                                      more powerful PDW ammunition such as 5.7mm. It can also be
                                      configured for 4.6mm PDW calibre, according to the customer's
                                      requirements. It comes with a 20 round magazine, and can engage
                                      targets of up to 200m.<br> <br> Designed to combat the demands of urban warfare, ST Kinetics' SSW
                                      offers a lethal 2-in-1 combination, packed into a light weight,
                                      compact and ergonomic design.<br> <br> Family of Weapons Concept<br> The SSW is built on a family of weapons concept for maximum
                                      commonality in terms of logistics and maintenance. Future variants
                                      could include a semi automatic grenade launcher using a box
                                      magazine combined with a PDW, or simply a semi automatic grenade
                                      launcher without a PDW. Designs are currently on the drawing board,
                                      and a first technical demostrator of the standard SSW is expected
                                      to be <strong>ready in 3 to 4 years' time.</strong></p>
