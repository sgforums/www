Don't know if it still happens, but it used to drive the umpires crazy! <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br><br>Back in my day (yes, I'm showing my age here <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"> ), it was BTEC, and we did what we were trained to do, which was namely guerrilla warfare.  We had no hierarchy and no set lines, so what we effectively did was disperse and envelope the opponent or form ad hoc teams on the spot to hit targets of opportunity.  From the outside it all looks chaotic (which was what the umpires objected to), but there is method to the madness.<br><br>And of course we overrun objectives - what's the point of attacking a target if all you're going to do is run around outside it?  We don't hold on to them for long, though - as I understand it, another unit such as infantry is usually meant to come and relieve us after a relatively short while.</div>
