If we get injured, SAF is not going to take care of us for the rest of our lives. Sure, there are times when we took shelter when it's raining. But it's only when it's raining damn heavy. I'm afraid of rain when i ride, in the field, it's pretty normal that if it doesn't rain we'll feel uneasy.<br><br>There's once my platoon was to harbour at marsiling training ground. It was raining real heavy but we still have to harbour. Suddenly, the sound of wood splitting then *THUMP*, a large tree fell, missing my friend by a few metres. We were then called back to the nearby training shed. Cat1 don't exist in the field unless we are at Pasir laba.</div>
