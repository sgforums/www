The system is envisioned as a 15-ton gross takeoff weight design, with a 40-meter wingspan, a 2,000kg. payload, and 50 kilowatts of power to drive sensors, says Singapore's chief defense scientist, Lui Pao Chuen.  Two versions are being conceived of: an intelligence collector and an airborne early warning configuration.  The system would exist in manned and unmanned versions.  Singapore has been working with Scaled Composites to devise the system, which still hasn't flown, but industrial relationship may changed. Singapore is referring to the system as a low-altitude, long-enduring endurance, as compared to higher altitude satellites.<br><br>Additionally, Singapore's ST Aero has built a stealthy-looking, 80-kg UAV, the MAV-1.  The system is slated to fly in the coming weeks, say company officials.  The vehicle is a test asset aimed at creating a market for a larger reconnaissance vehicle.  Flight testing of the UCAV-like design should run most of the year.</div>

The system is envisioned as a 15-ton gross takeoff weight design, with a 40-meter wingspan, a 2,000kg. payload, and 50 kilowatts of power to drive sensors, says Singapore's chief defense scientist, Lui Pao Chuen.  Two versions are being conceived of: an intelligence collector and an airborne early warning configuration.  The system would exist in manned and unmanned versions.  Singapore has been working with Scaled Composites to devise the system, which still hasn't flown, but industrial relationship may changed. Singapore is referring to the system as a low-altitude, long-enduring endurance, as compared to higher altitude satellites.<br><br>Additionally, Singapore's ST Aero has built a stealthy-looking, 80-kg UAV, the MAV-1.  The system is slated to fly in the coming weeks, say company officials.  The vehicle is a test asset aimed at creating a market for a larger reconnaissance vehicle.  Flight testing of the UCAV-like design should run most of the year.</div></blockquote><span style="color: darkred;">Your posted photo of the ST Aero supposedly developed MAV-1 - being serviced, although smaller in scale, seems to have some semblance with the BOEING UCAV X-45A in flight</span><br><br><img src="http://www.boeing.com/news/releases/1999/photorelease/990412n1.jpg"><br><br><img src="http://www.aviationnow.com/content/ncof/images/aw1832.jpg"><br><br><span style="color: darkred;">Click to the following BOEING site for info and pics:</span><br><a href="http://www.boeing.com/phantom/ucav.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.boeing.com/phantom/ucav.html</a><br><br><span style="color: darkred;">Other sites of UCAV</span><a href="http://www.fas.org/man/dod-101/sys/ac/ucav.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.fas.org/man/dod-101/sys/ac/ucav.htm</a><br><br><a href="http://www.aviationnow.com/content/ncof/ncf_n71.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.aviationnow.com/content/ncof/ncf_n71.htm</a><br><br></div>
