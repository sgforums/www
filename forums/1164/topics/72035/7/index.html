You've already copped out by saying that you'd parroted someone else's idea, showing that you've got no commitment to it.  On top of that, you go off on tangents of teaching, ethics and EQ, assuming respectively that I haven't done it, haven't thought through it and don't know anything about it, only to find that you've been outrun, outmaneuvered and outgunned.  Put in some genuine intellectual effort and I might start taking you seriously.</div>

It sounds great, other than that, there is no practical use for it. You fire too many rounds at one time, impossible to clear a misfire round and reloading is questionable.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hi,<br><br>Metalstorm technology is not just hype. It is a new technology which you are able to program the firing of stack rounds by timing or manual tigger. This make it a very effective technology<br><br>For like the new ST squad weapon rounds are stack one after another, this safe lot of space, the firing of each is a put of a trigger.<br><br>While in a claymore role, the first stack of very small rounds can be fired in the first press of a button. Imagine if you can fire 2nd or 3rd stack of rounds with a press of a button. If you are attack by wave and wave of soldiers like in vietnam, I sure you will appreciate this technology.<br><br></div>
