I don't like to argue for i do not know why what i wrote contradicts each other in the first post. When i wish to know why, there isn't any but i'm being called an idiot.

            <div class='col-md body'>Silenthunter, with all due respect, I do not believe that jacobs' passive-aggressiveness deserves any other kind of response.  This "I'll say something controversial and then act dumb, injured and innocent" tactic is one that simply cannot be respected.  I will cease and desist if you so require, but I will stand by everything that I have said thus far.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Well, officially it's Industrial / Organisational psych.  This covers a whole lot of stuff including what you've mentioned.  Personally, I take raised morale to be a result rather than a cause, though - I don't go for that rah-rah stuff.<br><br>My main area originally was recruitment and selection, including all of the psych testing and interviewing involved, and this led to organisational structure design later.  I later went over to program evaluation, which in turn led to human factors work, mainly involving HCI (Human Computer Interaction), as well as things like situational awareness and cognitive performance in stressful or emergency conditions.</div>
