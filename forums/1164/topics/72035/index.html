            <div class='col-md body'>Unveiled: Singapore Technologies Engineering, one of the world's top arm developers, got to shrut its stuff at the recent aerospace show<br><br>By Felix Soh<br><br>THE enemy can run - but can't hide.<br><br>The new products by its subsidiary companies - ST Kinetics, ST Marine, ST Electronics and ST Aerospace - were unveiled for the first time at the recent Asian Aerospace 2004 show.<br><br>They reflect the growing technological sophistication and ground-breaking innovation of made-in-Singapore weapons.<br><br>One that created a buzz at Asian Aerospace was the Stars Wars-like Squad Support Weapon (SSW), which integrates a 40mm grenade launcher into a rifle as a single, seamless handheld weapon.<br><br>The revolutionary dual-calibre weapon, still under development, is designed for urban warfare, which is easily the most deadly and difficult type of combat operations today as the ongoing conflict in Iraq shows.<br><br>The SSW equips foot soldiers with lethal firepower. Its next-generation programmable 40mm Air Bursting Munition, a world's first in cutting-edge technology, can hit enemy troops concealed behind windows or on rooftops.<br><br>The weapon's ability to hit targets beyond the reach of conventional ammunition extends to enemies hidden in bunkers and caves.<br><br>Another product that attracted much attention at the air show was the Fantail, a mini-unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) ideal for use in urban missions.<br><br>It can hover over an area to give a 'god's-eye' perspective to infantrymen in a variety of battlefield scenarios.<br><br>Equipped with a day, low-light or night camera, the Fantail provides over-the-hill, around-the-corner and over-the-next-building surveillance and reconnaissance. When fitted with chemical sensors, it can detect a chemical attack and track the source.<br><br>And it is not just for war fighting. The mini-UAV has law enforcement and civil defence applications as well. For example, it can observe a forest fire from positions that would be too risky for humans.<br><br>Also well-received at the air show was the launch of Maps - Maritime, Aviation and Port Security Solution - which generated much interest from visitors because of concern over the vulnerability of ports to terrorist attacks from the sea.<br><br>The integrated Maps system provides vital installations such as ports, petroleum refineries, seaside resorts and oil rigs with automated surveillance, detection, assessment and immediate response to threats.<br><br>It offers 24-hour, all-weather surveillance cover for ports and their cargoes with a panoply of sensors like radars, sonars, day and night video cameras - and even intelligent fences with intrusion and motion detectors.<br><br>'Maps is a cost-effective system because it reduces manning levels,' said Mr Lee Fook Sun, ST Electronics' president of defence and international business.<br><br>'Only a limited number of people are needed to manage multiple threats.'<br><br>One new product that made many heads turn was the Spider Light Strike Vehicle.<br><br>The six-seater is probably the world's only centre-wheel drive vehicle - with the steering wheel and driver's seat positioned in the centre in the front, with two other seats on either side.<br><br>What next? Even smarter weapons and systems.<br><br>Said Mr Sew Chee Jhuen, ST Kinetics' executive vice-president for defence business: 'We are developing smarter munitions, guided weapons and putting more intelligence into vehicles.<br><br>'We are also more network-centric, that is, further enhancing the situational awareness of commanders.'<br><br>Stealthy, unmanned weapons and systems will also be a main area of focus. 'The future will see more autonomous vehicles and other equipment that can navigate by themselves and give soldiers a forward view without endangering any lives,' said Mr Sew. 'Robots will be big.'<br><br>--ST<br><br>the SSW truly sounds interesting! too bad canot post the picture here.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Anyone knows what the establishment of this weapon is going to be? I assume it's going to be a replacement for the M203/M16, so quite a number of men are going to be saddled with this monstrosity...<br><br>I agree, they really should look into miniaturising the 40mm airburst round to 20mm, just like the US has done. And yeah, shame on Sing Tech for the self-promoting misrepresentation...the SSW's airburst round is hardly a "world first" - the OICW's airburst grenade has been used in general field tests for years already.</div>

After the walk to the objectives, their job is done. Even if they have to set their firebase on top of some freaking knoll, they can "take their time". For the LAW, i must say it's really irritating to the gunner. My parang was secured at the back of my SBO, and it got hooked onto the branches at times. So when we are doing our fire and movement, dashing with LAW and M203 through the bushes, proning and running upslope. Who is in a worse situation? :]</div>
