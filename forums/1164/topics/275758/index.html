            <div class='col-md body'>before the mods delete this thread.. please allow me to say... i am not interested in this ongoing squabble... with the exception on the possible security implications that such release of IP might present to singapore's security.<br><br>with thoudsands of IP link to owner and the address of the owner now in the hand of ODEX... and presumably.. they can get more by constanting applying to the court for more...<br><br>it shouldnt be too difficult to surmise that among the thoudsands of identities that is now in their hands ...<br><br>there would probably consist some high profile address and owners... like maybe ministers and senior govt officials...<br><br>i am not saying the ministers or senior officials are pirating anime... but am concern of the potential such information might be available to foreign intel agencies...<br><br>if ODEX can determine who is downloading anime... wont foreign intel be just a step away from determining which website each of our ministers and officials are surfing and thus build a profile of our ministers character?<br><br>would foreign intel agents.. now armed with the IP address of our ministers computer be able to hack into the computer and download sensitive files... or simply monitor our ministers email and surfing?<br><br>for example.... a minister or senior official IP found googleing porn sites... , frequent visit to swiss bank internet site... saucy letters between him and his lovers.... all the dark and dirty secrets of his/her dealings...<br><br>such information if leaked...could have very serious implications for singapore national security.... foreign countries could blackmail our ministers/officials into submission or into providing sensitive information.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I would think it's too far-fetched.<br><br>Reason being, IP addresses in SG are dynamic, with the exception of those leased to web masters. Those will be static.<br><br>Unless these ministers are dumb to the extent of having their own website, the scenario isn't so possible.<br><br>However, given that ODEX have information on at least 3000 users, the security implication is there.

Privacy and Transparency are opposites.  Security is an outcome to be achieved.<br><br>Security can be achieved when u have and extreme of one but not the other.<br>You can max out privacy, make sure nobody knows nobody, and nobody can hurt anybody, hence no one can breach security due to obscurity.<br><br>Or, you can have extreme transparency, that everybody knows everybody and cannot breach security cos your measures are able to stop them because of the extent of knowledge given by extreme transparency.<br><br>Unfortunately, we don't live in a black and white world.  Everybody wants to have privacy, but wants others to be fully transparent. People feel safe when they are obscured, and when others are transparent.  Its natural.<br><br>In this Odex case, they are pretty much obscuring themselves by not being transparent about their so called "Extensive evidence gathered", and intends for others to be transparent by manipulating the law.

ODEX may be a "front coy" utilised by the PRC to obtain information in SG. SG lies at the tip of their strategic oil/energy lines, thus PRC elements definitely would want to plant some agents in SG. Eg. COSCO, it is well known that it is not just an innocence shipping coy, but a large front coy for the PLA. COSCO have been used by PRC to ship advance weapons and systems to rogue elements in the middle east. Recently, I read somewhere that some later era PRC made MANPADS were seized in Afghanistan, eventhough PRC has committed openly towards fighting terrorism. No doubt SG govt have been kind to their citizens, BUT in their eyes we are nothing more than an USA outpost and a stumbling block determined to check them.................</div>
