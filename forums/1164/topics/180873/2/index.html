Like what tripwire said, without the big toys, others might think who we are to talk big. We need to make our presence felt. those toys act as multiplier and together with our diplomacy, then can we achieve peace.<br><br>I think our government is very effective. for other country, i know for sure that higher defence budget comes at the expense of other sectors. but for us we can increase our defence, together with education, health at the same time. Yes it leads to higher personal income taxes, but our taxes are one of the lowest in the world, be it GST or income tax. if you dun smoke, dun change car so often, dun bet so much, u dun have to pay so much taxes.<br><br>when we buy more toys, we also stand to gain as our toys are sometimes produced locally. who stands to gain, with maintenance and production done in singapore?</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Investment in our defence is important. We have to let all know that we are serious about this. But I think there is a need for some balance. It's not like SAF is the underdog in the region. No way we can be a superpower.<br><br>Still there are many smart ways to invest the $8 billion.<br><br>Transparency is also important. So much money can lead to abuse and waste. Not to mention, corruption. It's been proven time and time again all over the world. Even here in Singapore.<br><br>IMHO, Mindef need to work on this.

            <div class='col-md body'>IMO,The fund allocation for military defense purposes in term of arm procurement and development shouldnt be a heated debate in the parliment. Being a small nation, some military spending must be/should due with  a discreet matter. if someone gonna ask the minister where does the fund goes to.Probably the only reply will be developing silver bullet then it defeat the purpose of questioning. More directly, SAF has the right to avoid some questions. I m sure the parliment fully understand it.</div>
