Of course,  Singapore denied, but our police believe that he was passing information.</strong><br><br>Q : But why wire-tapping friends? Neighbours shouldn't do this to each other,<br><br>A : Well, but we find friends do tap and listen to what friends talk about, but I think Singapore does it in a much more offensive kind of way,.....</blockquote>2.Dr M could removed Anwar for his own interest.<br>Would Dr M detained the innocent political secetary  just to blacken<br>SG?</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>just read the "Mahathir supports Thailand in S'pore row" article and realised how hypocritical Dr M is. One moment he says Singapore is not a good friend as we only think of ourselves. Another moment he said "Although he(Thaksin) has said I was his friend and he wants to follow my way, many of his ways are not my way" and <span style="font-style: italic;">The former Malaysian leader said he would welcome a meeting with Thaksin only if the former Thai premier asked for it - but then quickly downplayed the idea, saying: "I don't have anything to discuss with him."</span></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>The incident that Dr M referred to is some time back actually, what he neglected to mention was that Malaysia probably did spy on SG that time too. Fact is that all countries do that, and since when was Dr M a friend anyway? Seems like he's just adding fuel to the fire in a bid to keep his political career alive.</div>
