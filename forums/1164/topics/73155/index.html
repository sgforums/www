            <div class='col-md body'>Extracted from Asia One.<br><br>Spanish upset sparks fears of more terror<br>Terrorists may try to dislodge other governments which supported US in Iraq in upcoming elections, say analysts<br><br>By Roger Mitton<br><br>WASHINGTON - The bombings in Spain and the surprise electoral dumping of its government have sparked new fears that emboldened terrorists may try the same violent tactics ahead of elections in Asia and the United States presidential poll in November.<br><br>Analysts say Al-Qaeda - widely suspected to have planted the bombs which killed 200 in the Spanish capital last week - and Asian regional terror network Jemaah Islamiah may now be tempted to try to dislodge other governments that have supported the US in the Iraq war and in its fight against terror.<br><br>Advertisement<br><br>'That's an amazing impact of a terrorist event, to change the party in power,' Professor Jerrold Post, a former CIA profiler who directs the political psychology programme at George Washington University, told Associated Press (AP).<br><br>Political psychologist Stanley Renshon of City University of New York agreed. 'The implications of this are fairly staggering. This is the first time that a terrorist act has influenced a democratic election,' he said.<br><br>'This is a gigantic, loud wake-up call. There's no one they'd like to have out of office more than George W. Bush,' he told AP.<br><br>Spain's centre-right government had been expected to return to power in Sunday's elections but the bomb blasts - seen by voters and others as possible Al-Qaeda punishment for Madrid's backing of the US-led invasion of Iraq - turned the vote in favour of the opposition Socialist Party.<br><br>Spanish Prime Minister-designate Jose Luis Rodriguez Zapatero has already declared he will pull the country's 1,300 troops from Iraq unless the United Nations takes over Iraq's reconstruction.<br><br>Mr Zapatero called the war in Iraq a 'disaster' and said 'there were no reasons for it'.<br><br>US newspapers and television reports have been dominated by discussion over the implications for Washington.<br><br>Mr Zapatero pointedly spoke of wanting to have 'cordial' relations with the US, but 'magnificent' ties with France and Germany. A year ago, France and Germany led opposition to the Iraq war.<br><br>A key concern for Washington is not only that a terrorist attack appears to have succeeded in influencing the result of a democratic election, but that the result has led to a new government less inclined to back the US.<br><br>Mr Michael O'Hanlon, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution in Washington, told Fox News: 'Now that the terrorists have seen this tactic work, will they be emboldened to try it elsewhere? That's the key question.'<br><br>Elections will be held in Malaysia and Taiwan at the weekend and polls will follow in the Philippines, Indonesia, Japan and Thailand. The fear is that the scenario in Spain could be replicated in countries like the Philippines, which have firmly and publicly supported the war in Iraq.<br><br>There is also concern that elections in July for Japan's Upper House could be affected by the government's controversial decision to send forces to support the reconstruction of Iraq.<br><br>----------------<br><br>If something like the above happen to Singapore, how will we react?<br><br>I like to think that Singapore will be even more hardened and will not bow to pressure from Terrorist group. But what do you guys think.<br><br></div>

This is the clearest sign that the invasion of Iraq was not part of the war on terrorism, and that the American troops in Iraq brought Al-Qaeda there, not the other way round.<br><br>And now, those who have helped him in his military adventures have started to reap the fruits of their flagrant disregard for international law.<br><br>The lackey Aznar and his government had it coming. He disregarded the overwhelming opinion of his people and followed the Texan village idiot into Iraq, then when the Madrid attacks happened, he refused to look at the obvious signs and attempted to put the blame on ETA, knowing that admitting its Al-Qaeda who were behind the Madrid bombs will show up his lies about invading Iraq to stop terrorism, and show that instead it is his participation in that invasion that brought terrorism back to his homeland.<br><br>It is only sad that the Spanish people must pay for his stupidity. We will do well to learn from this. Supporting the invasion and occupation of Iraq only gives the murdering terrorists of Al-Qaeda justification for attacking a country, in supposed retaliation.</div>

You can't bomb a people, you can't organise a war with lies," he said.<br><br>Almost exactly a year after Jose Maria Aznar stood shoulder to shoulder with President Bush and Mr Blair in the Azores on the eve of the war against Iraq, his party has been removed from power partly because of the unpopularity of that war.<br><br>If al-Qaeda was behind the Madrid bombings, it could be said that this was a significant strike by the terror group. It has forced a change of government in one of Mr Bush's leading allies.<br><br>Not that Spanish voters support al-Qaeda, but nor do they support the policy in Iraq.<br><br>And, like the French and Germans, they want a rethink. In particular, they want a separation of the war on terror from the war in Iraq, which Mr Bush has said is the "front line" in the war on terror.<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><br>Balance of power in EU </span><br><br>The arrival of the Spanish socialists back on the European scene will also shift the balance of opinion on Iraq within the European Union. Mr Blair has lost a close ally and may have to turn further east to the new members joining on 1 May to reinforce his position.<br><br>Mr Bush and Mr Blair have themselves suffered what must be seen as a rebuke by the Spanish people.<br><br>Whether they suffer rebukes from their own voters in due course remains to be determined.<br><br>It is not at all a foregone conclusion that they will. It is worth noting that on the same day that Mr Aznar's party lost power in Spain, the single minded Vladimir Putin was returned to power without trouble in Russia.<br><br>His hallmark has been a ruthless approach to the issue of Chechnya, Russia's own war.<br><br>Mr Bush is arguing strongly in his re-election campaign that his leadership and determination are key assets and ones which his Democratic Party opponent John Kerry cannot match. Equally, Senator Kerry will argue that the doubts in Spain over Iraq match those of the American voters.<br><br>And the immediate reaction of the British Government has been to stand firm and to declare that there will be no change in policy. Foreign Secretary Jack Straw rejected the argument that countries which softened their approach would be safer:<br><br>"Nobody, nobody should believe that somehow we can opt out of the war against Islamic terrorism.<br><br>"The idea that somehow there is some exemption certificate for this war against terrorism is utter nonsense," he told the BBC.<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">New effort in Iraq </span><br><br>One result of the Spanish election will be to reinforce the British and American efforts to get Iraq back in the hands of Iraqis. In that way, they hope to reduce the impact of Iraq on the wider campaign against al-Qaeda.<br><br>They will press for a new UN Security Council resolution in May to give approval to the handover of power to an interim Iraqi government by the end of June.<br><br>However, large numbers of foreign troops will stay, and under an American general, so they could still present a target and a reason for attacks.<br><br>The new Spanish Government will want to bring its troops home. But the Socialist Party has in the past left the door open by saying that they might remain if there was an UN mandate for them. Whether that remains the position in view of the strong feelings in Spain is a matter of debate.<br><br>Either way, the doubt over their future in Iraq opens up yet another unwelcome issue for President Bush.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Agreed, Viper.  Had the war genuinely been seen as just by the people, the bombing would simply have served to strengthen the Spanish people's resolve to return the incumbent government to power.  To think that a terrorist act could influence the people's thinking so much so that they do a 180-degree turn is nothing short of scaremongering - at most, it simply swayed something that was already in the balance.</div>

For that, Spain has its previous PM to thank for.<br><br>It is precisely because the terrorists are like the wolves you described, that the Americans should have put all effort to hunt down the remnants of Al-Qaeda and their Taliban backers when they were on the ropes in 2002, instead of going off half-cocked into Iraq, stretching their own resources and turning their attention away from the real job at hand; which was putting Osama out of circulation<br><br>If you look at the pattern in Al-Qaeda's statements since the invasion of Iraq began, you'll realise that the Texan village idiot and his lackeys turning their attention onto Iraq was a godsend that Osama could only have dreamt about without the stupidity of Bush. The invasion of Iraq only served to galvanise Muslim public opinion against America and served to throw a spanner in the works of the attempts to convince moderate Muslims that America's war on terror was against the terrorists in Afghanistan and not all Muslims. Using flimsy evidence of terrorist links and WMDs in Iraq didn't help that claims by the extremists that the Americans are looking to start a new crusade against Muslims. It played right into the extremists hands.<br><br>As Gedanken said, had America and its Allies stayed only in Afghanistan to hunt for Osama and Al-Qaeda struck in Spain, it would have served as a reminder to the Spanish people and the world why it is necessary to stay the course Afghanistan to fight terrorism, and in the election it would have strengthened the incumbent government's hand.<br><br>Instead, this attack has served to show the world how stupid Bush and his lackeys were to blunder into Iraq and allow themselves to be sidetracked from the real war against terror and Al-Qaeda, instead giving the terrorists a new excuse and new battlegrounds to strike against their enemies, while giving them breathing space to carry out their devilish deeds. Would Al-Qaeda been able to plan, coordinate and carry out this attack if just 50% the troops currently in Iraq were in Afghanistan hunting for Al-Qaeda? I seriously don't think so.<br><br>Going into Iraq to suck up to the Americans is stupid, period. Its a case of the blind and stupid, leading the eqully blind and dumber.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Paul, it's not so much a question of staying neutral as not getting into a war when you don't have the most solid of reasons.<br><br>Like Viper said, the Afghanistan war was a direct response to 9/11, and had Bush left it at that, it would have been fine.  the war on Iraq, on the other hand, was started on the most tenuous of excuses, and when governments do that sort of thing, there will always be political hell tp pay.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>The question now is, is America equipped to deal with the terrorists?  I suspect they may not be, because their military might has always been geared towards fighting a concretely-organised opponent, not one that is as diffuse as a terrorist organisation.  As the author of Unrestricted Warfare said, "it has been wielding a large hammer but has been unable to find the flea".<br><br>The US now finds itself in the unenviable position of having to prove its effectiveness to its allies, in a situation where eliminating its targets quietly and without fanfare is required for success.</div>

Over the course of 2 years the world has arrested terrorist but it just keeps coming..bali, jakarta and now madrid. Force on force is not the key here in my opinion..Islamic states like Saudi Arabia, Indonesia has got to buck up and sort of redefine Islam, to takle the roots. Launch campaigns and prevent the weak minded frm harboring terrorist thoughts. Now it's as if Islam's only existance is to attack the US and those who help them.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Exactly, paul.  The US prides itself on its adherence to democratic law.  Were they to change their stance on that now, it would be a political victory for the terrorists anyway.</div>
