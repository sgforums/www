While walking pass a newspaper vendor, I get a copy of The STAR and it boast about the capability of their commandos from 10th Brigade or something....

            <div class='col-md body'>My own experience:<br><br>1 n half year ago, I was in Mt Ophir area for a weekend. there were military vehicles moving around the country roads there. I was with a local friend climbing the mountain casually. on the way, met some MAF soldiers training, they asked food or anything could eat from us. during the talking, they had to finish climbing to top and then down in 1 day. the "sir" didn't agree them to eat, so they were extremely exhausted and hungry.<br><br>Judged from their strength of training, I believed they should belong to elite force.</div>
