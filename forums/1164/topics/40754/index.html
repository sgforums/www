            <div class='col-md body'>Have you seen how america is fighting wars nowadays?<br>To take over a tiny little town. They call in artillery, air strike, armour THEN the infantry goes in.<br>I was having a talk with one of the warrant officer in my unit and he was saying this is a very expensive procedure. He stated that though it's cruel to send men in to try and clear the area and when they really can't go through then call in air strike / artillery, it is cheaper in the long run. Singapore don't have enough bombs / cash to carry out that abovementioned procedure.<br><br>And he was saying U.S. is terrible in FIBUA, always lose to the enemy. He's not saying that we're good or anything but i think what he was trying to say is that the U.S. over reliance on support fire has resulted them in not being proficient in infantry warfare. But come to think of it, they are constantly the offensive force so to me they are always on the backfoot coz the enemy is the one hiding.<br><br>What do u all think regarding war tactics? Chiong till cannot chiong then bomb? or bomb until shiok then chiong?<br>I know you guys like to take men into consideration and say you'll pick the second option coz it saves lives. Okay think of it this way, if there is a war similar to WWII, where you really don't expect the war to end quickly and costs come into the picture, which tactic will you choose?<br><br>I just think that if this iraqi war is going to last longer than expected, U.S. is going in incurr a huge loss.<br><br>Oh, and i'm not speaking about Singapore, just general perspective<br>Don't quote this message, just post new reply.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Its not that they have lousy infantry skills, or they are bad in FIBUA. Its just that the very nature of FIBUA negates their advantage in technology, (like restricted communications due to LOS restrictions, many places where enemy can hide in etc) and one MUST always remember that the US always fights with the foremost consideration of sustaing low casualty counts. That is their true weakness. Its because of this consideration such that they have evolved their warfighting techniques, which is to have overall situational awareness which allows them to pulverise the enemy (using air support or arty) from where the enemy is still too far away to retaliate. Not until the enemy force is degraded till they are rendered pretty ineffective do the US ground forces, at the place and time of their choosing, close in to wipe off the enemy. Its really logical to do it this way.</div>

Not only did they not overstate their civilian loses they have also not overstated american losses(by much) caused by their forces, but doing this they added credibility to their own news media. And how do you suppose that the information minister and al jazeera can help in getting the iraqi army's act together???<br>Anyway, the iraqis are doing much better on the propagand front then the war front whether you like it or not and it is part of their strategy.<br>You said war isn't fair and you cannot ask the americans to play fair, then how can you ask the news media and the people in charge of iraqi propaganda to play fair. A few farmers with AKs standing over a multi-million dollar attack helo might not reflect what truly happened, but it gets the msg across to their target audience.</div>

If anything, it seems to be hurting their own troops as they think they can apparently take on Allied units with nothing but rifles and prevail, spurred on by their propangada. Many cases of untrained conscripts rushing tanks with nothing but AK-47s, and fighting Bradley's with nothing but their rifle thinking they can apparently penetrate the armor. They were mown down.

            <div class='col-md body'>The Iraqis never bothered to put up an organized defence in the first place. They are relying too much on their "unconventional" warfare to do the job, which has not been working to stop the allies so far.</div>

One slight problem though...the German blitzkrieg strategy in Soviet Union worked so well that they didn't secure their supply lines proper; and that led to partisan attacks in the rear, therefore having to divert troops from the main war effort to guard supply lines...that's the same thing happening now, with Iraqi soldiers dressing up as civilians and conducting sabotage/ ambush/ skirmishes.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>The American aversion to taking casuties was what saved Aideed (ironically if the americans had apprehended him, he would probably still be alive today). As a matter of fact, Aideed let the captured american pilot go after threats that the americans would let go of all restraint and come in with <span style="font-style: italic;">real</span> firepower in a terrible mission to bring a quick and bloody end to their regime. He didn't even get anything in return. The situtation at Mog. woke the americans from their post-gulf war innocence and they packed not because they could not beat the Somalis and win the situtation, but because they saw that they had no interest in there, why trade your life for a bunch of ungrateful skinnies?<br><br>The greatest losers were probably the Somalians, who missed out on a chance to break their cycle of poverty because of their warlords.</div>
