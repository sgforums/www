              <p><a href="../../../users/44974">Gedanken</a>.. nice setup and thanks for the tip! I am using A-DEP on my 40D!... YEaH ! I do have similar setup U have .. I will try to bounce the light or a light box setup. Wow ! 50D with the 100-400L! I am looking for this lens for my Aviation photography!.... I guess time to save up! but they are still alillte pricey. Miss out a good deal last year when MSN Live was giving back 20% cashback. </p>
              <p>YEah! 1911 definalty more comfortable over the Glocks and USP.  Actually CZ75  is quite good  !so is the Browning  high power for double stack.People with small hands just don;t have much choice. I guess thats why evn HK is comming out with plastic ppistol with changable grips! </p>

              <p>Holy crap! <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_eek.gif" alt="icon_eek.gif"> You must have paid close to the GDP of a small African nation for that camera! Which Canon model is that?<br>The Tanfoglio line of Italian-made pistols is very highly regarded in European competitive shooting circles, and many of their models are essentially clones of CZ guns. Unfortunately, Tanfoglio's US importer and distributor, European American Armory (EAA), has a well deserved reputation for piss-poor and downright abusive customer service. I was at one point seriously considering getting the version of their Witness semi-auto chambered in 10mm, but didn't want to risk having to deal with EAA if anything went wrong with the gun. </p>

              <p>U are not alone on the shooting stance ! my wife tends to shoot leaning a bit back.  am still trying to kill the bad habbits! she is getting better now.  and she also does a lot of anticipation of the recoil and pull the pistol down when she fired it ! maybe thats a women thing.</p>
              <p>HOwever she is enjoying her M4 much better than the pistols! U can see her smile when she hit the target at 400 meter with the M4 and that is priceless!</p>

              <p>Dave, sadly that's the 70-200 2.8L IS, not the 100-400.  The 100-400's got extra reach, but some users have said that the autofocus system isn't quite 100% - apparently in random conditions it tends to hunt around for focus.  At the moment I'm trying to get my hands on one of those bad boys to see for myself how true the complaints are.<br><br>In any case, the 70-200 is a brilliant lens - when I switched over from the Sigma 18-200 OS it was like going from VHS to DVD.  Yeah, the Canon's four times the price, but damn, it's worth it.  Here's a shot I took with the 70-200 on my 400D body:<br><br><img src="http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v229/Gedanken/_MG_1955.jpg" alt=""></p>
              <p>Meia, as Dave would agree, the prices of the camera bodies aren't the main problem (although Canon's flagship 1Ds Mark III is about AUD10,000) - it's the prices of the lenses that'll really hurt you. <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Cartoon/teeth.png" alt="teeth.png">  I just moved up from a 400D to a 50D because my shooting's finally started to outgrow the 400D's capabilities, but before that I spent a few months upgrading my lens collection (and ended up spending about five grand in four weeks <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Cartoon/teeth.png" alt="teeth.png">).</p>
              <p>I've only had the 50D since Sunday, but this coming Sunday I'm off to the Australian open, so I expect that I'll have a chance to get a few decent shots there.  Anyway, we're going off-topic here.  I've got some photos in another part of the forum (<span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #3366ff;"><a title="this" href="/forums/3078">here</a></span></span>) if you guys want to check out some photos.</p>
              <p>Getting back on track, it sucks that Tangfolio would be hobbled by EAA's poor service.  Are there parallel distributors, or is that what you're stuck with?  Speaking of Tangfolio's, here's one of the first few photos I took with my old 400D:</p>

              <p>Holy crap, Ged! That image is outstanding! You managed to capture the muzzle and compensator flashes--how did you time the shot to accomplish that?</p>
              <p>I am not aware of any parallel importers of Tanfoglio firearms into this country--it looks like we're stuck with EAA for the moment. That's a shame, as the Tanfoglios, though very accurate guns, do suffer from somewhat inconsistent QC that might require the gun be returned to EAA for warranty work. The problem with EAA centers around their president and chief gunsmith, Paul Richter, who is an eminently arrogant and cocky SOB who revels in belittling, insulting and verbally abusing his customers, and outright refusing to honor valid warranty claims. It's amazing his company has managed to remain afloat for this long.</p>

              <p>Holy crap, Ged! That image is outstanding! You managed to
                  capture the muzzle and compensator flashes--how did you time the
                  shot to accomplish that?</p>
              <p>I am not aware of any parallel importers of Tanfoglio firearms
                  into this country--it looks like we're stuck with EAA for the
                  moment. That's a shame, as the Tanfoglios, though very accurate
                  guns, do suffer from somewhat inconsistent QC that might require
                  the gun be returned to EAA for warranty work. The problem with EAA
                  centers around their president and chief gunsmith, Paul Richter,
                  who is an eminently arrogant and cocky SOB who revels in
                  belittling, insulting and verbally abusing his customers, and
                  outright refusing to honor valid warranty claims. It's amazing his
                  company has managed to remain afloat for this long.</p>

              <p>That shot took a bit of doing - it took something like ten tries to get it right.  Then again, that's precisely why I switched to DSLRs - the P&amp;S shutter lag started to get really irritating, and if I'd gotten that shot with a P&amp;S it would have been almost entirely by chance. <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Cartoon/teeth.png" alt="teeth.png"></p>
              <p>Hmm, I wonder if Tangfolio are aware of how this Richter fellow is damaging their rep stateside.  Maybe you should appraise them of it.  Who knows - if you were so inclined it might just create a good business opportunity for you. <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Cartoon/shade.png" alt="shade.png"></p>

              <p><a href="/users/133646">viciouskitty74</a> I think .38 fits your hand much better and thus doest not induce your body to comepnsate for the recoil! I have seen my wife doing all the weired stuff when given a bigger or more menecing piece.</p>

              <p>I was at the range last night putting some rounds through my Glock 34 and testing some new handloads in preparation for this year's Bullseye League which starts in February. Since I had the gun completely apart for cleaning this morning, I decided to snap an image of it with the parts all strewn out:</p>

              <p>The image didn't quite turn out well as I'm not used to taking pictures of dark-coloured objects against a white background. Perhaps a dark grey sheet of cardboard would have worked better as a backing sheet.</p>
              <p>Here's a close up of the front of the Glock 34's slide, showing the high-contrast fiber-optic front sight that I added recently. The difference between it and the crappy factory front sight is literally like night and day:</p>

              <p>(And yes, I know it's not a 1911 and this is a 1911 thread, but the my <a href="/forums/1164/topics/314279">original Glock 34 thread</a> has expired and I didn't want to start a new one just to post a couple of images..<img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="icon_mrgreen.gif"> )</p>

              <p>No doubt full frame is nice, but unless you're doing portrait photography (where FF gives you shallower depth of field) or landscape photography (where you get more width), you may find that it's not worth the money upgrading.  Besides, with the 40D, you've got 2.5 frames more per second than your mates with the 5D2.  Work out what you need to shoot before deciding on the camera, to avoid taking an M82 along for jungle fighting. <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Cartoon/teeth.png" alt="teeth.png"></p>
              <p>Yeah, one of these days I'm going to have to find more ranges that will offer opportunities for more photos.</p>

              <p><br><em>(My apologies for resurrecting this ancient thread, but I just realized that I had forgotten to get back to Dave about how I take those images.)</em></p>
              <p>Dave,</p>
              <p>Sorry for this late reply, but I hope the following image gives you an idea of the setup I use to take my gun pictures:</p>
              <p><img src="http://i160.photobucket.com/albums/t194/screwthepap3/RSR_20090216_01.jpg" alt=""></p>
              <p>As you can see, it's nothing fancy. The entire rig is set up next to a window for maximum lighting, and I use aluminium foil inserted into a transparent LD protective jacket to bounce light into the shadowed areas. In the rig above, I also used a DVD jewel case with foil inserted into the front cover to bounce light.</p>
              <p>The camera itself is mounted on a tripod and triggered with the self-timer to eliminate shake, since the exposure time is longer due to the use of the smallest f-stop setting to maximize depth of field. The camera in this case is my trusty Canon PowerShot S3 IS.</p>
              <p>Here is the image I took with the setup above:</p>
