              <p><br>Hi, Dave! LTNS.</p>
              <p>Yeah, I've always liked Springfield's line of 1911s. Even their less expensive entry level ones are built good enough to be used as a foundation for a "race-gun" build.</p>
              <p>Sharp eyes on the finish! The frame still sports the original parkerized finish, but the slide was sent to Mac's Shootin' Irons Restoration a few years back for a refinish using GunKote as the original parkerization was starting to wear through. As a result, there's a small but noticeable difference in the finish between the slide and frame (as you've noticed in the images!).</p>
              <p>What's your 45ACP handload recipe, by the way?</p>

              <p>There was another "pistol rifle" (i don't know what its called). Single shot breech loading thingie that jarred my shoulder.</p>

              <p>thats what I thought Meia... those parkerizing on the Springfield isn;t the greatest coating. Anywya! good job on the finishing! did you do it yourself??  I have use the durcoat and have good luck with the finishing ! Excpet you have to prep your surface to get the best result.</p>

              <p>I am looking to get a 9mm setup for the 1911!  My wife seems to prefer that over the CZ-75 that she is shooting now! seems too fat for her ! Am thinking about the Springfield EMP!  Any comments on that&gt;??</p>

              <p><br>Dave,</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Hey, what a coincidence! Those are the same components I use for my 45ACP handloads too. My recipe calls for a 230 gr. Rainier (or Berry's, whichever is on sale) RN TMJ atop 5.4 gr. of Universal Clays, for an OAL of 1.27" and lit off with a Winchester LP primer. My brass of choice is either Remington or S&amp;B (I avoid Winchester and PMC brass like the plague as they are dimensionally extremely inconsistent). This load clocks about 820 fps out of the 5" barrel of my CZ 97B and is <em>extremely</em> accurate.</p>
              <p>I am curious about one thing, though. You use 4.3 gr. of Universal Clays in your recipe--that seems a little on the light side. Hodgdon's load manual for Universal Clays and a 230 gr. projectile starts at 4.8 gr. and tops out at 5.6 gr. During my load development for 45ACP, I noticed that anything under about 5.0 gr would result in incomplete combustion and leave unburnt flakes of power in the gun and on the bench. Did you run into a similar problem?</p>

              <p>I guess great man think alike! My load is getting about 700 -730 fps on my springfield, I guess I time mine such that it does not give me accesive flip thus a faster follow up shot!  I time that to my lighter load! Did have any problems with my 4.3 grain though! I will try your receipe and see if it runs better!</p>

              <p>Its not about the manly appeal. you know what they say, size compensates for something else. well i aint got one, so i need big guns to compensate XD</p>
              <p>nah. actually its the purposefulness of the chunkiness thats strangely alluring and sexy.</p>

              <p>Well, technically, the 50 AE and 500 S&amp;W Magnum are "50 cal." rounds. Having fired both, I can attest that an Asian male of average stature <em>should</em> have little difficulty handling the recoil. The blinding muzzle flash and massive concussion of the muzzle report certainly convey the impression of overwhelming recoil to an observer, but the truth is the sheer heft of the guns launching the projectiles help in absorbing much of the recoil impulse.</p>
