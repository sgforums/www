Soldiers receive automatic promotion to PV2 after 6 months time in service (TIS). Soldiers are automatically promoted to PFC after 12 months TIS and 4 months time in grade (TIG). Soldiers are automatically promoted to SPC after 26 months TIS and 6 months TIG. In all cases, promotions occur unless the commander takes action to prevent the promotion. Based on strength computations at the battalion level, there may be allocations available to promote soldiers earlier than the automatic TIG/TIS requirements.A SGT (3SG-1SG) might take them 36 months to get.A SSG(probably our SSG) takes 84 months, they have two more ranks, SFC(Sergeant First Class= our MSG) and SGM(Sergeant Major) which unlike the SAF, is an actual rank, not an appointment,<br><br><img src="http://www2.powercom.net/~rokats/em_now1.gif"><br><br><img src="http://www2.powercom.net/~rokats/em_now2.gif"><br><br>Hope this helps. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"></div>
