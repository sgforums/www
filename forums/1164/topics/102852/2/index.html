A couple of years back - I bump into a number of US Marines in Malacca on a guided RnR tour. They were hosted by the guys from the Malaysian RDF.<br><br>The Malaysian army Ranger Unit? I think you may have mistaken with the commandos/special forces group. The Royal Malaysian Ranger Regiment is actually a regiment consisting of conventional Infantry battalions, Mechanised Infantry battalions and a single Airborne Infantry battalion distributed across the the operational divisions and brigades. Despite the word "Ranger", they are not commandos or special forces. It comes from a traditional line dating back to the British colonial days.</div>
