              <div class="info">Mon, 07/13/2009 - 2:00pm</div>
              <p><img src="http://www.foreignpolicy.com/images/090713_waltb.jpg" alt=""></p>
              <p>As I mentioned awhile back, I devoted a good chunk of my vacation out west reading Piers Brendon's <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Decline-Fall-British-Empire/dp/0224062220"><em>The Decline and Fall of the British Empire, 1781-1997</em></a><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Decline-Fall-British-Empire/dp/0224062220">.</a> As you might imagine, I spent a lot of time thinking about possible
                      parallels and lessons for America's current global position, just as
                      English imperialists spent a lot of time pondering the Roman experience
                      (ably documented by Edward Gibbon).<br><br>In a tapestry this rich and
                      varied, it is easy to read into it just about any "lesson" one wants to
                      draw. With that caveat in mind, here are the top ten lessons on empire
                      that I drew from Brendon's book. Even if you don't agree with them, you
                      should still read the book.  <br><br><strong>1. There is no such thing as a "benevolent" Empire.</strong></p>
              <p>In
                      his classic history of ancient Rome, Gibbon had noted that "There is
                      nothing more adverse to nature and reason than to hold in obedience
                      remote countries and foreign nations, in opposition to their
                      inclination and interest." Britons thought of the empire as a positive
                      force for themselves <em>and</em> their subjects, even though they had
                      to slaughter thousands of their imperial subjects in order to maintain
                      their control. Americans should be under no illusions either: if you
                      maintain garrisons all over the world and repeatedly interfere in the
                      internal politics of other countries, you are inevitably going to end
                      up breaking a lot of heads.<br><br><strong>2.<em> </em>All Empires depend on self-justifying ideology and rhetoric that is often at odds with reality.</strong></p>
              <p>British
                      imperialists repeatedly portrayed their role as the "white man's
                      burden" and maintained that imperial control brought considerable
                      benefits to their subjects. (This is an old story: France proclaimed
                      its <em>mission civilizatrice</em>, and the Soviet empire claimed it was
                      spreading the benefits of communism. Today, Americans say we are
                      spreading freedom and liberty).  Brendon's account describes the
                      various benefits of imperial rule, but also emphasizes the profound
                      social disruptions that imperial rule caused in India, Africa, and
                      elsewhere. Moreover, because British control often depended on
                      strategies of "divide-and-conquer," its rule often left its colonies
                      deeply divided and ill-prepared for independence. But that's not what
                      English citizens were told at the time.<br><br><strong>3. Successful empires require ample "hard power." </strong></p>
              <p>Although
                      the British did worry a lot about their reputation and prestige (what
                      one might now term their "soft power") what really killed the Empire
                      was its eroding economic position. Once Britain ceased to be the
                      world’s major economic and industrial power, its days as an imperial
                      power were numbered. It simply couldn't maintain the ships, the men,
                      the aircraft, and the economic leverage needed to rule millions of
                      foreigners, especially in a world where other rapacious great powers
                      preyed. The moral for Americans? It is far more important to maintain a
                      robust and productive economy here at home than it is to squander
                      billions of dollars trying to determine the political fate of some
                      remote country thousands of miles away. External conditions may impinge
                      on U.S. power, but it is internal conditions that generate it.<br><br><strong>4. As Empires decline, they become more opulent, and they obsess about their own glory. </strong></p>
              <p>Brendon's
                      description of the British Empire Exposition at Wembley in 1924-1925 is
                      both slightly comical and bittersweet; with cracks increasingly evident
                      in the imperial façade, Britain put on a lavish show designed to bind
                      the colonies together and highlight its continuing glory. Moral: when
                      you hear U.S. politicians glorifying America's historical world role,
                      get worried.<br><br><strong>5. Great Empires are heterogeneous.</strong></p>
              <p>The
                      British empire was not a uniform enterprise; the various bits and piece
                      were acquired at different times and in different ways, and the
                      relationship between London and the different components was far from
                      uniform. One could say the same thing for America's less formal global
                      "empire": its relationship with NATO is different than the alliance
                      with Japan, or the client states in the Middle East, or the bases at
                      Diego Garcia or Guantanamo. An empire is not one thing.<br><br><strong>6. When building an empire, it's hard to know where to stop.</strong></p>
              <p>The
                      expansion of the British empire after 1781 shows how difficult it is to
                      engage in a rational assessment of strategic costs and benefits.  Once
                      committed to India, for example, it was easy for Britain to get drawn
                      into additional commitments in Egypt, Yemen, Kenya, South Africa,
                      Afghanistan, Burma, and Singapore. This was partly because ambitious
                      empire builders like Cecil Rhodes were constantly promoting new
                      imperial schemes, but also because each additional step could be
                      justified by the need to protect the last. History has been described
                      as "just one damn thing after another," and so is the process of
                      imperial expansion.<br><br><strong>7. <em>It takes a lot of incompetent people to run an empire. </em></strong></p>
              <p>A
                      recurring theme in Brendon’s account is the remarkable level of
                      ignorance and incompetence with which the British empire was
                      administered.   Although there were obviously some very able
                      individuals involved, Britain’s colonial endeavors seem to have
                      attracted an equal or greater number of arrogant, corrupt, and racist
                      buffoons. The bungling that accompanied the U.S. occupation of Iraq
                      looks rather typical by comparison.<br><br><strong>8. Great Powers defend perceived interests with any means at their disposal.</strong></p>
              <p>Great
                      powers like to portray themselves as "civilized" societies with
                      superior moral and ethical standards, but realists know better. Like
                      other empires, Britain used its technological superiority without
                      restraint, whether in the form of naval power, the Maxim gun,
                      airplanes, high explosive, or poison gas., and the British showed scant
                      regard for the effects of this superior technology on their
                      "uncivilized" targets. Today, the United States uses Predators and
                      Reapers and smart bombs. <em>Plus ca change ...<br></em><br><strong>9. Nationalism and other forms of local identity remain a potent obstacle to long-term imperial control.</strong></p>
              <p>Britain's
                      supposedly "liberal" empire contained a deep contradiction: a society
                      that emphasized individual liberties could not hold in bondage whole
                      societies and deny the inhabitants independence. Once nationalism took
                      root in the colonies (intermingled with other tribal and/or religious
                      identities), resistance to imperial rule increased apace. As the United
                      States is now discovering in Iraq and Central Asia, most peoples don’t
                      like taking orders from well-armed foreigners, even when the foreigners
                      keep telling them that their aims are benevolent.</p>
              <p><strong>10.</strong> <strong>"Imperial Prestige" is both an asset and a trap. </strong></p>
              <p>Britain's
                      leaders fretted constantly about any erosion in their image of
                      superiority, fearing that one or two setbacks might lead their subjects
                      to rise up or encourage other great powers to poach on Britain’s
                      holdings.   As a result, Britons found themselves fighting to defend
                      marginal possessions in order to preserve their position in the places
                      they believed mattered.  Ironically, the refusal to liquidate far-flung
                      commitments early so as to focus resources on more vital interests may
                      have hastened Britain's imperial decline.  <br><br>There are
                      undoubtedly other morals one can draw from Brendon's account, and other
                      historical treatments would undoubtedly suggest a somewhat different
                      set of lessons. I wouldn't want to overplay the parallels between
                      Britain and the United States, if only because the U.S. empire is
                      mostly ad hoc and informal rather than a network of formal colonies.
                      But there is one final moral one could also draw from Brendan's fine
                      work: <em>there is life after Empire.</em> Britain may be past the glory
                      of its imperial heyday, but life expectancy, health care, educational
                      levels, GDP/capita, etc. are all higher now than they were in
                      Victoria's time.</p>
              <p>Defenders of the Empire foresaw doom-and-gloom if it
                      ever dissolved -- and sent many men to their deaths to prevent that
                      from happening -- but its eventual demise did not produce the disasters
                      back home that many had feared. Great Britain remains in influential
                      force in world affairs, if anything batting slightly above its weight,
                      and is more secure now than at any time in its modern history. For
                      those of us who think the United States should stay out of the empire
                      business, that's a reassuring thought.</p>
