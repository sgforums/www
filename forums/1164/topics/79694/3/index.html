All the hard work put in... the CDOs have gone thru hell and back.... we truely deserve it! and u call dat kelong??? pls think think.... come and be a cdo and you'll noe dat it's the best army life the government can offer you for 2/1/2 yrs....</div></blockquote>Yes, being a CDO entails SHITLOADs of hardwork, but bear in mind that other combat vocations, although less glamourous also put in equal if not more effort in carrying out their training. Pride is a dangerous thing. To be proud that one dons the beret of the elite is one thing, but to think that you are the best is a dangerous move. This will utimately result in underestimating your opponent and definitely caused unnecessary casualties not to mention inviting a bullet to the head.</div>
