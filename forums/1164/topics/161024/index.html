            <div class='col-md body'>The MILAN ATGM is a guided missile system dedicated for the destruction of tanks and APCs.Well,the MILAN basically contains two parts,(1)the missile and (2) the launcher (MIRA). As we know, the MILAN is bascially wire-guided up to a distance of 2km.<br><br>Am curious as to what happens to the wire as it spools out from the missile tube and where will it end up?As its not easy making 2km worth of wire disappear suddenly.<br><br>And also,had the chance to play with the MILAN simulator at Marina South. And a malay 1WO was telling me that as the missile is wire-guided,directions/firing adjustments cannot be made suddenly but have to be made slowly and gradually so that the wire can compensate for the movement.But i did not have the opportunity to ask if during a live fire, i suddenly correct the missile's guide path,what will happen to the wire?Will it snap or anything?<br><br>thanks in advance.</div>

If it missed then how? Detonate the C4 that was already placed at the dummy target!  Make it look like some kinda hit.  Hahaha.<br><br>I believe if one can fire a milan, one can fire a spike.

            <div class='col-md body'>Is that what they call LOAL? Fire and fix?<br><br>In LOAL modes, for those missile which are capable of that, eg Hellfire etc, the missile is launched at a trajectory without a guaranteed lock.  After launching, then the target is locked on.  For aircraft like the apache/longbow, it allows them to fire from behind terrain masking, set the missile to clear a certain altitude, before another aircraft locks on to the target.<br><br>This is generally bad news for those tanks with Active defense systems, where they are able to detect radar , or laser designators illuminating them.  Reason is cos it really reduces their reaction time.</div>
