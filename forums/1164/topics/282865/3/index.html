            <div class='col-md body'>Firstly, it doesn't mean that the PRC would win once they land troops on Taiwan.  Its barely half the battle.<br><br>I'm sure the Taiwanese would have lots of anti-landing preparations done in anticipation of such a scenario.  Once the task force is within 20km of Taiwan, they would probably begin systematic targeting of Command and Control ships.  Without command and control, would the amphibious landing be effective?<br><br>Taking in mind of a prepared battlefield, the odds are really against the invaders. So gaining air-superiority over the amphibious is a must.  But when u stack what China has now, against the Patriot missiles, and F-16s operating over friendly territory(higher sortie rate), it seems doubtful that China can achieve air superiority.<br><br>Personally I think that its a darn pity that the Taiwanese didnt acquire the Apaches.  The ability to quickly shift firepower around would be most valuable in anti-landing operations.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>According to TW intelligence, there are 998 rockets aimed at the island.<br><br>I am sure, as part of China's first strike option, a good number of those would be fired to soften and cripple main C &amp; C installations before the invasion takes place, if any.<br><br>To sum it all up. Whoever, that executes the first strike well would be in a better position.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>how about PLan send some maverick admiral harassing the taiwanese navy... the since the taiwanese have a better naval ship the admiral 'accidentally' launch nuke to the heavyly defended Quemoy and its major airbase.<br><br>as quickly as possible say sorry to the world and make a military trial and shot the admiral...also don forget to show some propaganda video showing that the admiral were in a state of mental ilness.<br><br>quickly offer medical aid and humanitarian aid! as a sign of good faith retreat all forces back accept the one that were incedentally commited in unit rotation..winks winks..(you dont need all 4 million soldier dude!)<br><br>the american while condemning the attack still not sure how to react since the chinese have retreat and appologise! so they would ask for some time to clarify things frim their own intelligence agencies (which as of now were covering each other arses by failing to predict the incident) so the american aid were stalled ....for a while.<br><br>as soon as the american eased down launched a full scale barage of all missile and saturate all defences. No since the underground base in Quemoy and airbases were anihilated by the 'accidental' nuke the saturation and bombing were complete. In paralel time launch a coordinated carpet bombing of the island ....<br><br>at the same time deploy the troops with NBC on the quemoy and after the surrounding area secure ....launch the fullscale invasion.<br><br>the key element is surprice and supress..... no let up in sending missile toards the defender!<br><br>wham!

USN then also "accidentally" Nuke the Shenzhen provincial command in then they send the Admiral into their war court then publicise him going into their prison....<br><br>Anyway, the Taiwanese dont have Apaches (dont want to lose the longbow technology in the future if they kenna taken over) but they do have the smaller brother the AH-1 cobra similar to the USMC ones. Those are equipped with both AT- Hellfire and the AS- hellfire.  AS stands for anti-ship. It's the difference in warhead denotation. Bigger bang/splash less armour penetration.</div>

We want to learn from Indonesia, but they are very humble and rejected us, scared we laugh at them. Wonder why we don't even try to learn from Malaysia? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"></div>
