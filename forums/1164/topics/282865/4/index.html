Have seen their training close up and talked to their junior commanders ( PCs, sgts etc).<br><br>They are quite old fashioned in their approach but on the other hand, their treatment of their troops is still quite brutal and it appears that safety is not a major concern. Maybe that hardens the typical Taiwanese soldier. THis was my observations of them.<br><br>Their observations of us....  they saw us on Starlight exercises. Mostly company and below movements. Some of their ignorant junior  commanders asked me if we practised " guerilla warfare" in Singapore.  THe reason is that they see us using small formations during exercises.<br><br>Can't blame them as a few of them were observers to my section plus of enemy simulators ambushing a company convoy from a hill slope !!!!  On another exercise, they saw a platoon conducting a raid on a simulated mortar fire base of battery strength !</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote>PLA's disadvantage is relatively lower tech, primitive methods, predictable Russian-influenced doctrines.</blockquote>If it was 10 years ago, I would fully agree upon your view, but as many things else, when you attempt to assesses the ChinaÂ’s development in recent years, you have to update much more frequently.<br><br>ROC navyÂ’s most modern surface platform is the four 1970s built Spruance class (DDG993) Kidd class, although itÂ’s NTU upgraded to equip with SM-2 BlkIII &amp; Harpoon, the SM-2s are still not Vertical launched like MK41 VLS does. On the contrary, PLAN new deploys a whole range of modern surface ships.<br><br>letÂ’s start with the four 8,000-ton Sovremenny-class destroyers with SS-N-22 Sunburn<br><img src="http://news.huash.com/gb/images/2007-01/27/xin_190104271318953270644.jpg"><br><br>Then PLAN has 2 type 052B DDG with C803 AshM and SA-N-12 SAMs:<br><br><img src="http://icc.skku.ac.kr/~yeoupx/CH.files/image016.jpg"><br><br>ThereÂ’re also AESA equipped, dubbed as Â“red AegisÂ” Type 052C DDGs with 4 face Phased arrayed Radar and 48 HQ-9A theater defense VLS over a range of 120kms<br><br><img src="http://i11.photobucket.com/albums/a184/Military_Pictures/ChineseAegis.jpg"><br><br>almost forget the Type 051C DDG with Russian made Rif-M ( Naval version of S-300) VLed theater air defense system<br><br><img src="http://www.0992.net/news/Article/UploadFiles/200707/200771793924932.jpg"><br><br>Then thereÂ’re also type 054A FFGs with 32 HQ-16 vertical launched middle range air defense system, 12 of this class will be built till 2009, now 4 already entered sea trail.<br><br><img src="http://www.cz0735.cn/upload/2007_07/070711111045481.jpg"><br><br>Of course, there are also dozens of FFGs like Type053 FFGwith point air defense only which may fall into your Â“low TechnologyÂ” category, but unfortunately, Taiwan does no better, as their only modern FFG Â“tiandanÂ” grade is also with only the point defense system.<br><br><a href="http://i11.photobucket.com/albums/a184/Military_Pictures/053withZ-8.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://i11.photobucket.com/albums/a184/Military_Pictures/053withZ-8.jpg</a><br><br>If comparing Submarines, thereÂ’re also a far cry between Taiwan &amp; China, PLAN has 12 Kilo and similar numbers of modern quiet SSKs like Â“SongÂ” &amp; Â“YuanÂ” grades, What Taiwan got, WWII Submarines which you think is Â“high techÂ”? How about SSN, PLAN has at least 2 old 091 SSN and 2 new 093 SSN plus at least 1 aged  092 SSBN and 1 modern 094 SSBN<br><br><blockquote>Their pros are HUGE HUGE number, enough to chiong many planes just to shoot down one ROC Mirage of F-16....enough to chiong beachhead wif big sacrifice. </blockquote>You are the one Â“chiongÂ”here without elaborate how the 300 strong PLAAF Flankers considered big sacrifice when facing ROCAFÂ’s F-16s, PLAAF also introduced J10 air superior fighter jets. According to Pentagon, J-10 is more comparable to Euro Rafale &amp; Typhoon than F-16 C/Ds,<br><br><blockquote><span style="color: blue;"> <a href="http://www.afa.org/magazine/July2006/0706watch.asp" rel="nofollow">http://www.afa.org/magazine/July2006/0706watch.asp</a><br><br>DOD seemed to offer a re-assessment of the capabilities of ChinaÂ’s F-10 fighter, which it previously had compared to the F-16 Block 30. (See Â“Washington Watch: Chinese Military Is Catching UpÂ—Fast,Â” September 2005, p. 12.) In this latest version of the annual China report, <strong>the Pentagon said the F-10 is probably more comparable to the Eurofighter Typhoon and French Rafale, considered among the top three fighters in the world today, after the US F-22A.</strong> The Pentagon expects more than 1,200 F-10s will be built, and improved versionsÂ—the F-10A and Â“Super-10Â”Â—are in advanced development.</span></blockquote></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I think the Chinese know that they can't take down Taiwan militarily with Soviet Era tactics and doctrines.  In terms of modernization process, they are just a few years away in matching the Taiwanese forces.  And the Chinese honestly speaking, have better infrastructure to support further modernization.  The Taiwanese on the other hand, usually rely on US tech transfers.</div>

Thanks to the 4 array Multi-functional Active phased array radar, thereÂ’re even no SPG-62 style Fire control radar spotted, indicating the 052C DDG probably utilizes an active radar guided SAM for theater defense. For comparison, Aster is such an Active radar guided SAM and SM-2 is still a Semi-active Radar guided SAM( which requires fire control radar SPG-62 for terminal illumination). The 4 array Active phased radar on board 052C will have enough Â“brutalÂ” power to execute search, target tracking, as well as providing middle course guidance for the HQ-9A SAMs all in one. While ROCNÂ’s most modern Kidd  class DDG  needs whole bunch of radars to do the same scope of job, SPS-48E, SPS-49 for air search and tracking, SPS-55 for surface search, SPG-51 for fire control.<br><br><img src="http://i23.tinypic.com/1zejtw7.jpg"><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hi all.<br><br>Joined the forum cuz i thought this thread was interesting..<br><br>anyways. here goes.<br><br>i think that if China attacks Taiwan, they will be able to take over the taiwan successfully.<br><br>1. Military of China is better than Taiwan(no diagreement there i believe.)<br>- More manpower, more missiles to shoot, etc. etc.<br>- Taiwan's US technology is not really modern US technology.. you guys know what i mean.<br>- dont underestimate chinese technology, they launched a man into space.<br>- heavy missile bombardment(china got alot of missiles) before attack to take out air defences and air bases of taiwan. (they know the location of most of them from their satallites. thats is, before the US takes them out.  :lol<img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"> with first strike, China will have a significant (air)advantage over taiwan. and trust me, ships are useless without aircraft.<br><br>2. US will NOT help significantly in terms of military aid(which is critical), probably juz codemn china blah blah blah and shoot chinese satallites.<br>why?<br>- 1. American public is still will be suffering from war weariness from the iraq war. taiwan is not "their" war. no public support for it. furthermore, the US is still suffering a huge trillion dollar defecit from the iraq war and will be unlikely to spend more $.<br>- 2. US is heavily dependent on China for its economy. the US heavily imports chinese goods. alot of stuff in the US Made in China.<br>yea sure, the chinese companies will get pissed too, but rmb, china is still govern be a communist govt. *hint hint*<br>- 3. US may not have enough manpower to launch a full scale counter attack. they are already suffering from manpower shortages form the iraq war (they are already down to national guards iraq.. kinda like US reservist, which the US dont normally use.)<br><br>IMO, the war will last like, 7 days?<br>China will chiong to taipei and take over the government. Then the taiwan govt cannot coordinate counter attacks properly and stir up the populace for resistence against the chinese.<br>China will deploy ships/subs around the taiwan penisula to deter against possible counter attacks from the US. they'll lose, but juz to slow the US down so that they can establish their own form of govt there.<br>Also, the slowing down of US aid(if it ever comes), will cause morale to drop and result in the govt to probably capitulate, so as to minimize civilian casualties.<br><br>It goes unsaid that the chinese will suffer significant casualties, and obtain a phyrric victory, making them vulnerable to other attacks(say, the UN/EU).<br><br>However, it will take time before the US rallys support with the EU for a war against China, but Russia wont be making this easy(they are still pissed at US for the missile defence system that the US wants to put around them.)<br>but this probably will not be feasible, as the EU has to go/fly through Russia and Soviet Bloc counties to get to China. Russia still has a nice air force if you know what i mean.<br><br>So, after alot of heavily staged debates and toungue slashing in the UN, China will retain control of Taiwan but may allow Taiwan to have a status similar to that of HK. (one country, two governments.)<br><br>Anyways. Just my 2cents.<br>Long post. Thanks to all of you that read through it(if any).  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br></div>

Korea and Taiwan being client states. These countries are strategically, militarily as well as economically important to US.<br><br>They represent US's hold on the region and a stumbling block on China's doorstep.<br><br>Remember that beyond these countries is the Pacific ocean, and beyond that is the USA mainland.<br><br>Losing Taiwan without the US lifting a finger to help would be the end of US role as the dominant world power. Countries previously loyal to US in Asia will all be thinking about switching allegiance and US will lose even more from this fallout militarily, strategically and economically.<br><br><blockquote>Originally posted by justcooler:<strong><br>But on their hand, US will be playing a spoilting role in the reunification. </strong></blockquote>Did they really?<br><br>I could be wrong but the US is against Taiwanese independence especially if it triggers a war. It is not a war US wants to fight now or in the near future. But because of their past obligations they have to get involved.<br><br><blockquote>Originally posted by justcooler:<strong><br>i believe that japan and south koera will play a more active role in the war against china</strong></blockquote>That's an inaccurate assumption.<br><br>Not everyone is keen to make a war bigger than it has to be. Korea and Japan have absolutely NOTHING to gain and everything to lose by taking part.<br><br>And the US may not want S Korea to take part cos that will likely open another front with the N Koreans jumping in. The US can't handle that, and S Korea is surely not keen to fight the North again/yet. So S Korea will have to stay uninvolved just to keep the Korean Peninsula stable.<br><br>Japan may also just play some passive role than risk being involved. Neither countries have an official pact to defend Taiwan, besides.<br><br>American allies will come likely in the form of faraway countries whose involvement in this region will not spread the conflilct. The usual suspects like Britain, Australia, other Europeans etc.<br><br>...<br><br>In spite of China's rapid advances they cannot overtake a country that's been the dominant world power since before any of us here were born. (1945, if you need a date.)<br><br>US is well-equipped for this kind of "shock and awe" high tech action. And destroying enemy's conventional war-making ability is, unfortunately for China - the US's house specialty.<br><br>It is the niggly kind of COIN action that the US has no patience for.<br><br>The US strategic goal will be a ceasefire political settlement. Its military goal will be to destroy as much PLA equipment as possible.<br><br>...<br><br>More likely, any hostile actions may just start and stop with China retaking or trying to retake the Nationalist islands of Quemoy, which is extremely close to China mainland and a bloody pain.<br><br>Such an action PLA will win easily. Great for publicity and also as a demonstration to the Taiwanese to think twice. Such a gamble is also less likely to spur direct US military action and may upset enough Taiwanese to rethink the pro-independence stance.<br><br>Going across the Straits to Taiwan Island will be a political and economic disaster for China even if it wins. If it loses, it will be a military catastrophe and all that this entails.<br><br>I am pro-reunification, peaceful of course. It is the only way that both countries can benefit out of this sillyness.</div>
