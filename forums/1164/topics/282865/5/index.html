            <div class='col-md body'>Any say about Taiwan developing that EMP bomb/warhead to take down PLA's electrical grids? Anyway...IMHO for China to succeed in taking Taiwan is simply a matter of time. Think logically ah..you need troops to hold ground. Definitely airborne forces will be deployed, and don't forget you have to send troops by sea as well. And China's amphibious capability is not that rock-solid yet. So though the navy will be protecting those troop transports, how many of them are actually able to make it to shore, we won't know for sure. PLA aims to overwhelm and take-over. Taiwan is an island, and its way more difficult to hit something small than big being my POV.<br><br>The key is...that ROC AF,Navy has to take out as many of those airborne forces while they are in the air, because troops in the air and in aircrafts can't fight back! Though you have fighter escorts whatever, take out the aerial troop transports, and part of the equation is complete, next is the amphibious forces. While at sea, they are sitting ducks, no matter how much protection they have, guns, missiles won't matter if the troops in them can't reach and estab. a beach head. Once this 2 parts (the invasion force) are taken out, nothing else matter. Essentially boots on the ground are needed to beat ROC into surrender, without that its all about how much beating ROC is able/determined to take. Thus IMHO...ROC has to find and exploit the logistical weakness that the PLA faces, and whack it big time to have a chance. Even if PLA has the reserve force to take over ROC after the 1st strike, they don't have the means to do so.<br><br>Its like, you have the money to invest, but I'm taking away your means (the stockbroker) so you can't invest and can't get a cash out. The rules of the game lies in how much means ROC can take away from the PLA in the opening hours.</div>
