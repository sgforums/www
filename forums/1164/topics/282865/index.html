            <div class='col-md body'>Back in the early 90s, Taiwan's armed forces can at the least still compare with the SAF. But in recent times, as singapore get more and more equipments from the US and other more advanced country, Taiwan seem to be losing out.<br><br>Can they even hold the ground long enough for US involvement? After the Iraq War, I got a feeling that it is going to take the US a much longer time to react or to send troops.<br><br>Plus the enconomic ties with china is going to make it hard for the US to help.<br><br>So can Taiwan counter a invasion from PRC?</div>

They are thousands of reports in Internet but only a few are credible. Do more research and analyse before u come to conclusion. Don't read blindly!</div>

How about 1000 over ballistic missiles all with a range over 300kms? How about Chinese LACM as reported by JaneÂ’s the DH-10 which with a range over 1500kms and CEP only 10ms? How about hundreds strong PLAAF &amp; PLANAFÂ’s JH-7 which can carry 4 short range Cruise missile( Ya, short range compared to TBM &amp; LACMs) with a range over 120-220 kms? How about 100 Su30MKs? And H-6 bombers which can launch land attack missiles to hit targets further in the TW island without stepping out of PLAÂ’s S-300 theater defense? You should keep a eye on the development on PLA, not me<br><br></div>

I thought it is a strait. Where got Ocean? While breaching can be quite predictable. Airborne troops will give element of surprise. 130km away prove much easy for helo and transport plane to land troops in critical area.

            <div class='col-md body'>Honestly... i dun think ROC soldier's quality is there.<br><br>Their conscript full-time duration is short, and the training not as comprehensive and well-rounded...their skill level is at a very basic level, I doubt they can fight cohesively as a combined arms force, and individual skill level is not quite there also.<br><br>Infantry, AI and Armour, I dun think can really make it....<br><br>Airforce pilot training not quite there too...limited flying time, limited budget, maintenance level low, crashes often, pilot do stupid things and crash due to lack of experience, radar systems old, F-16A/B can't make it compare to PLA's.<br><br>Navy...a few really good frigate, but against the great China navy albeit with old technology, but with its many times more number of missiles, I dun think they can hold long.</div>
