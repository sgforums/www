I understand that you've migrated out of Singapore, and that is really fine with most of us.  Even if you've dropped your Singaporean citizenship, you're still welcomed to post here and speak freely.  However, your replies tend to offend us with that "mightier than thou" attitude.<br><br>If you've migrated, thats fine.  But don't speak to us like we are idiots for staying in Singapore.  We have our own emotional attachments to this place that we are born in.  Singapore ain't perfect and theres still lots to improve on freedom of speech and expression, and I'm sure we will continue to work on that.  For a young nation to have gotten this far, I think we're doing pretty good.  So be a lil "merciful" with your anti-Singapore remarks and more objective with your comments.<br><br></div>

And Taiwan cannot even gain a sympathy from even US. PRC is no arab nation that can be easily overrun and staking a surprise attack easily. Especially ,PRC is a space power recognise nation. Space surveilance satelite can easily track ROC large scale miitary movement..<br><br>Bring war to mainland China is even more unthinkable. First ,ROC navy lacks enough amphibious force to land enough battalion to support a decent attack. Plus PLA is so huge and most forces concentrated around Taiwan are elite forces including marines and ariborne mechanised units. I bet ROC army will be crushed in few seconds , shall they land on Mainland China and even suit PLA. As their strong point is their army!<br><br>The only way for ROC to win is to survive PLA onslaught for at least 4 days if not,anything looks dimmed for ROC..</div>

WHat Shotgun provides is the latest update of PLA military stands. I bet u are using half a decades ago info to gauge PLA standard by now.. Do u know PLA military is advancing quite fast. Some 2-3yrs old datas of PLA were completely outdated by now! Go China forum defense to keep yrself update,ok?<br><br>As for Shotgun access of PLA amphibous capabilites, we have to take into account many civil transport ships which can be quickly employ by PLAN to suppor their operations. All these remains a secret But It seems PLAN has stopped producing amphibious craft after the Yuting II for some time...<br>My bet is they are quite confident,they can bring enough firepower and amour across the straits to take over Taiwan..</div>

PLA Army is going to face a dirtied terrain with LBs pretargetted by MLRS and artillery.<br><br>Disorderly  and uncoordinated disembarkment of troops will hamper and delay troop deployment that allows Taiwanese to counterattack(Seen the cute M60s doing their firing practises? I dont know how effective that is frankly. I would have prefer using missiles and rockets)<br><br>Ships and planes will arrive at different timings even if they leave at the same timing as attacks will cause transports to manevour away.<br><br>Lack of supplies will hamstring the offensive within 72 hours of the operation.<br>How far can China go in 72 hours of delay battles and ground offense that's a problem Taiwan has to create and China has to prevent.<br><br>China would need friendly skies to aid their assault while Taiwan need only neutral skies to grind them to a halt.<br><br><strong>If China is able to overcome the initial phase and establish control over decent port and airport facilites, the battle of Taiwan will be lost.</strong><br><br>Please dont compare how much china has in secret. Every nation has secrets. It's not how much and how powerful these secrets are , but when and where will they be employed that makes the most difference.<br><br>TO sum it up, It's like a modern day D-Day for China and should it happen will be a great tactical and strategic study subject for decades to come by military personnel.<br><br>It is in my wish that the option of FORCE be not used over this matter and that Taiwan's sovereignty issue be resolved peacefully.</div>

Some 2-3yrs old datas of PLA were completely outdated by now! Go China forum defense to keep yrself update,ok?<br><br>As for Shotgun access of PLA amphibous capabilites, we have to take into account many civil transport ships which can be quickly employ by PLAN to suppor their operations. All these remains a secret But It seems PLAN has stopped producing amphibious craft after the Yuting II for some time...<br>My bet is they are quite confident,they can bring enough firepower and amour across the straits to take over Taiwan..</div></blockquote>Actually, you just need to surf a few websites.  No special access whatsoever. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br>The name of the game hasn't changed since Operation Overlord.  Protect your transports, secure beachhead, capture ports.  Special Operations should only be used to support these actions, eg, cutting off communications, demolishing bridges etc.  There hasn't been that many amphibious invasions since WW2 actually, so don't expect the concept to differ too much.<br><br>I think the technology just makes the effort a lot more bloodier for the side thats less prepared.  Fail to develop a good anti-air/missile system, you lose ships, men, and material.<br><br>Anyway, invasion aside.  There has to be some strategic objective to invade Taiwan.  Would it be to occupy Taiwan in its entirety?  Or would it simply to capture the center of Taiwan's government?  And what effects would it have even if they were successful against a majority people who want to be independent? (Actually, I am more inclined to believe they prefer and enjoy the status quo)<br><br></div>

Space surveilance satelite can easily track ROC large scale miitary movement..<br><br>Bring war to mainland China is even more unthinkable. First ,ROC navy lacks enough amphibious force to land enough battalion to support a decent attack.

Technologically, China may have a slight edge with its bigger, unrestricted budget, and near unrestricted access to technology compared to Taiwan. However, can the PLA have the capacity to absorb and utilise technology as effectively as the military of other advanced western nations.<br><br>On balance, the reality is that - numerically, the Taiwanese military is overwhelmingly outnumbered by the PLA.<br><br>If all the Taiwanese military can do is only to wait for PLA to initiate attack, Taiwan's weakness will be totally exposed in a <span style="font-style: italic;">'Defense Only strategy'</span> - waiting to absorb the destructive punches from waves of missiles, aerial and amphibious assualt assets.<br><br>Taiwan cannot depend entirely on a strategy to simply sit tight and absorb the initial and subsequent attacking waves over any period of time, but will need to have the capacity to initiate a counter-punch that will need to be similarly devastating to the entire economic and social infrastructure of Mainland China - as China's attack will have destroyed the entire economic and social infrastructure of Taiwan already.<br><br>Its destructive ability to launch a counter-strke across a wide spectrum of economic and social infrastructural assets on the mainland will have to take on a highly publicised profile - so that the Political and Military leadership on the Mainland will not make any miscalculation if the Mainland decide to embark on a military solution.<br><br>Hopefully, this threat of total armaggeddon - in total mutual destruction - will help to prevent war across the Straits of Taiwan; as in the balanced threat of total mutual destruction between the super powers had prevented war from occurring for the last fifty years.<br><br></span><br><br></div>
