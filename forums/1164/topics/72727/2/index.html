            <div class='col-md body'>Some latest news on the M8......<br><br><blockquote>Inside The Army<br>March 15, 2004<br>Pg. 1<br><br>Army To Transfer Four Armored Gun Systems To 82nd Airborne Division<br><br>The Army last week approved the transfer of four M8 Armored Gun Systems from contractor storage facilities to the 82nd Airborne Division at Ft. Bragg, NC, sources say, marking the first time the vehicles will be used by the service since the program was terminated in 1996.<br><br>Proposed in the 1980s as a lightweight combat vehicle that could fit aboard a C-130, the AGS was canceled as the Army struggled to pay for other priorities. Contractor United Defense LP, which fought the cancellation decision, has five M8 AGS vehicles in stock -- four in York, PA, and one in San Jose, CA.<br><br>The 18th Airborne Corps at Ft. Bragg recently passed along an Â“operational needs statementÂ” to Army Forces Command that spells out the divisionÂ’s need for a rapidly deployable vehicle with firepower that could be dropped from an aircraft (Inside the Army, Feb. 16, p1). The ArmyÂ’s operations and plans office, or Â“G-3,Â” has been reviewing the requirement with Training and Doctrine Command.<br><br>TRADOC completed its analysis on Feb. 19, and the G-3 approved the needs statement on March 8, authorizing transfer of the existing vehicles to the 82nd Airborne Division, sources say. By press time (March 11), the Army had not released a copy of the approval documents.<br><br>According to one source, officials made it clear in the documents that the transfer in Â“no way should be construed as support for an AGS program.Â” Instead, it is an attempt to meet the immediate requirement with an interim solution and allow the division to begin developing and refining tactics, techniques and procedures.<br><br>The unit expects to receive the vehicles by the end of March, the source said.<br><br>Rep. Robin Hayes (R-NC), a member of the House Armed Services Committee whose district includes Ft. Bragg, said he is pleased with the decision, but does not want the transfer to be misconstrued as a move to revive the terminated program.<br><br>Â“To be clear, I am not endorsing one system over another,Â” Hayes told ITA in a March 12 statement. Â“I simply believe that, if these existing AGS are combat-worthy, then they should be fully utilized while we await the future technologies that are already in production.<br><br>Â“My priority on this matter is simple -- what can we do to help our soldiers in the field the fastest?Â” he added. Â“If our soldiers can utilize these existing systems, then I want these systems in Baghdad rather than in a manufacturing facility in Pennsylvania.Â”<br><br>Hayes asked the Army last December to provide him information on the matter, including how much the transfer would cost and whether spare parts are available to maintain the gun systems. Last week, a spokesman for Hayes said the congressman was told government and contractor costs are estimated at approximately $1 million for one year of support for AGS.<br><br>The funding, however, is not as much of a concern to the Army as the availability of parts for a system that was terminated eight years ago. Sources say UDLP can sustain the systems for a limited amount of time, but many of its components are now obsolete or unavailable. Supporting the system beyond one year poses high risk, sources said.<br><br>Herb Muktarian, a spokesman for UDLPÂ’s ground systems division in York, said the systems are ready to go.<br><br>Â“We have not received any official requests from the Army regarding AGS, but the four AGS vehicles stored in York remain in excellent condition and weÂ’re ready to provide support if asked to do so,Â” Muktarian said.<br><br>Maj. Rich Patterson, a spokesman for the 18th Airborne Corps, said officials at Ft. Bragg have been notified and are assembling the necessary manning documents, additional equipment and training plans, Â“with the intent to integrate the AGS into division operations as soon as possible.Â”<br><br>The vehicles will go to the 1st Battalion of the divisionÂ’s 17th Cavalry Squadron, Patterson said. AGS will provide its assault teams Â“mobility, firepower and shock effectsÂ” within the Â“drop zone,Â” he added.<br><br>Â“It gives us a capability we could deploy if we need it,Â” Patterson said.<br><br>AGS features a 105 mm cannon, an ammunition autoloader and options for armor protection.<br><br>The divisionÂ’s requirement for an air-droppable platform has existed at least since the 1990s, when the division disbanded one of its battalions -- the 3rd Battalion of the 73rd Armored Regiment, which was equipped with an aging armored reconnaissance vehicle called the Sheridan. At the time, service officials thought other capabilities would become available to the paratroopers once the M551 Sheridan was retired.<br><br>When the division deactivated the armored battalion in 1997, however, then-Army Chief of Staff Gen. Dennis Reimer had already terminated AGS, which had been regarded as the SheridanÂ’s replacement. Eliminating AGS freed more than $1 billion over the serviceÂ’s outyear funding plan -- money that was badly needed for other cash-strapped programs, officials said at the time.<br><br>Two years after the program was canceled, service officials said they continued to review options for all light forces that wanted more firepower. Vehicles reviewed included AGS, the Marine CorpsÂ’ Light Armored Vehicle, the Pandur lightweight vehicles used by the Kuwait National Guard and a variant of the M113 armored personnel carrier (ITA, Oct. 4, 1999, p1; Sept. 27, 1999, p1).<br><br>That effort, however, went nowhere, and the 82nd Airborne Division resubmitted its request for such a vehicle, eventually attracting HayesÂ’ attention.<br><br>Â“LetÂ’s find out as soon as possible if AGS can serve effectively as a short-term solution for an immediate operational need,Â” Hayes told ITA last week.<br><br>-- Anne Plummer</blockquote></div>

SPHS aren't built with a lot of protection in mind, they are supposed to provide mobility to a honking huge gun and then portection later.<br><br>Since SPHs typically operate behind lines, their main concern is not LAWs, but counter battery fire, hence the armour is enough to stop small arms fire and most sharpnel, but not anything major.<br><br>The Primus does not have any 'slab' armour, it is just plain steel, and pretty thin ones at that.</div>
