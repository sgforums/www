That means that ST was and maybe is still working with UDLP on a new light tank., otherwise they would not have display it.

            <div class='col-md body'>Few things we habe to consider b4 shortlisting potential<br>replacements.<br>1) Tonage. It cant be too heavy. That rules out most of the MBTs like your Israeli, French MBTs, T-90s etc. You might ask why.. after all the british committed the mistake of thinking tanks are unsuitable for this terrain and then Japs proved them wrong back in the 40s. But those tanks are light in comparison to todays MBTs. If you look at the more recent<br>Vietnam war, the US MBTs experienced difficulty operating<br>in our terrain especially during the monsson season which can turn the fields into a sea of mud. Also consider if our roads can take it, no point damaging them and rendering the roads impassable to other vehicles. Like the German Tiger tanks did back in WW2.<br><br>2) Size. Once again, absolutely pointless for us to go out and<br>purchase the biggest, latest and most impressive MBT. Cos if you consider in the event of war, our little island is bound to be exposed to a barrage of artillery fire, rockets, missiles and stuff. Theres bound to be rubble on our roads. Imagine a huge, big fat tank trying to navigate its way down Shenton way, Orchard road or your typical HDB estate.... Its not gonna be easy. A smaller, nimbler tank which can lay firing support and provide a degree of protection to our infantry would have been a lot smarter.<br><br>Therefore, MBTs like the M-1 Abrams, Leopard II.. while impressive may not be suitable. I say go for something similar to our SM-1 tank or build something from scratch if possible so as to better suit our needs.<br><br>Arm-chair-general, A-Tan</div>
