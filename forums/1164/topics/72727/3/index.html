            <div class='col-md body'>looks abit like mammoth / rhino tank from red alert2 when I first saw the picture.<br><br>yah the M8 not deployed by the americans, it was supposed to replace the sheridan tank but due to some budget constrains and politics by pen-pushing and point-scoring generals it's was shelved, it became a very unpopular decision as it left the army dangerously low on firepower and without a good "light force" capability. But the development cycle for the M8 is over and ready for production.<br><br>the M8 has many similiarity to our amx as a light tank, is fast, agile and air drop, manned by crew of 3 which same as amx, has 3 different levels of armor incl protection for nbc and sports a 105mm gun, fires heat/sabot rounds. Uses an auto-ammo-loader cart for 21 rounds + another 9 for storage compares to ours ....<br><br>The  "thunderbolt" version proof of concept using 120mm main gun was also demonstrated in the live firing demo at an exhibition in 2003.<br><br>Not saying we shud buy it but hope the boys at mindef will look for replacements which complements and not compromises or cut corners to the existing capabilities we already have on an amx.</div>

After the end of Warsaw       pact Poland had to modernize Polish Army main battle tanks on it's own.       Starting from July 1991 T-72 modernization programs were made by "BUMAR"       combinate which have been serially producing T-72 under Soviet license. Modernized       main battle tank got indexation PT-91 "Twardy" (twardy       - rigid [English]). From base modification it differs in increased defense,       fire control system and engine. In 1993 Polish Defense Ministry ordered 20       tanks PT-91 for polygon and Armed Forces tests.<br><br>Â Â  Main battle tanks defense from       high-explosion projectiles and missiles is increased by new ERAWA dynamic       armor developed by Poland Military-Technical Institute. This defense       consists from 394 containers with explosives, detonating in case of direct       hit. Containers cover 9 m tank's square. 108 containers are placed on the       turret, 118 on the hull and 84 on each sides anti-cumulative screens. PT-91       "Twardy" uses steel anti-cumulative screens instead of rubber       used on T-72. The main ERAWA's difference from Soviet analogs is that       ERAWA's containers fit almost without gaps while on the Soviet modernised       T-72 gaps reach 10 - 15 mm noticeably decreasing defense       effectivity.Â There are two ERAWA's modifications ERAWA-1 and       ERAWA-2 differing in explosive's weight.<br><br>Â Â        Experiments showed that ERAWA dynamic defense decreases high-explosion       stream proofing depth by 50 - 70 % and undercaliber projectiles - by 30 -       40 %. Furthermore explosive containers doesn't detonate hited by bullets,       projectile or mine fragmentations, burning napalm or petrol.<br><br>PT-91 "Twardy"       is armed with 125-mm smoothbore gun 2A26M2 used in T-72 "Ural".       Main gun is fitted with reloading mechanism which allowed to decrease guns       loader as a crew member. Main gun has great rate of fire in 10 - 12 rounds       per minute. Additional armament contains from 7.62-mm coaxial PKT and       12.7-mm anti-aircraft NSVT machine guns. Most believed that now machine       guns are changed to fit NATO standards. PT-91 has thermosmoke device       generating smoke screens from fuel and 24 grenade launchers fitted with       smoke or anti-personnel grenades.<br><br>Â Â        Fire control systems modernization started by changing earlier used Soviet       two plane stabilizerÂ  2Je28M into new stabilizer developed in Slovakia.       It has electronic tank's technical condition information block.       Furthermore it informs commander when effective sighted fire becomes not       perspective in case of too large cross-country speed or other reasons.<br><br>Â Â        Fire control system "Drawa" developed by Polish engineers       contains gunners day sight PCD and passive night sight PCN-A (there can be       placed TES thermovision night sight developed by Israel company ELOP),       commanders combined day-night passive observation and aiming sight POD-72,       ballistic computer, laser rangefinder and data system preparing       information for ballistic computer. Ballistic computer's sighting depends       from targets speed, weather conditions, projectiles temperature,       projectiles type.<br><br>Â Â        Commander has       control and diagnostic complex       US-DK-1 controlling tank's main systems and displays information on       monitor. Driver's night sight was       changed into passive night sight "Radomka".<br><br>Â Â        Increased modernized main battle tanks weight made developers to place       more powerful engine. It is12 cylinder S12U diesel engine. S12U is a modernized       version of Soviet engine V-46-6 produced in Warsaw by "PZL-Wola".       S12U has 850 h.p. instead of 780 h.p. V-46-6. The main difference was in modernized       fuel and air feeding system. This factor decreased tank's road endurance noticeably       decreased. Latest PT-91 "Twardy" versions got 1 000 h.p. engine       S-1000 with exhaust compressor.<br><br>Â Â        Tanks with S-1000 engine got indexation PT-91A and it's commander variant       with additional communication devices - PT-91A1.<br><br>Â Â        Communication equipment contains from Russian complex "Abzac"       including radio set R-173 and radio recipient R-173P, block of signal       filters and laringofon amplifier.<br><br>Â Â        On PT-91 "Twardy" chassis there was planed to produce recovery       vehicle WZT-3, armed engineering vehicle and drivers training vehicle.<br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br><br>I think they will choke to death if they found out they bought the model which uses "TES Thermovision night sight" developed by israeli company  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_twisted.gif" alt="Twisted Evil" title="Twisted Evil"></div>

It entered service with Japan Self-Defense Forces         between 1989 and 1990. In 1998Â  "Military Ordnance"         magazine published that the Type 90 takes the third place in the best         world main battle tank list. This third position depended on armor         protection, mobility and firepower features. Furthermore it is said that         the Type 90 is the most expensive main battle tank in the world as         well.Â <br><br>Â Â  It's         history begins in 1976 when the "Mitsubishi Heavy Industries"         began to develop a new main battle tank named as "STC". This         new main battle tank was intended to replace the Japanese Type 61 Medium         Tank and the Type 74 Main Battle Tank.         "Mitsubishi" designers were cooperating with German developers         of the "Leopard 2" Main Battle Tank         from "Krauss-Maffei" and "MaK". Of this reason the         "STC" prototypes built in 1982 and 1984 were very visually         similar to the "Leopard 2". This         new main battle tank after field testing entered service between 1989         and 1990 as the Type 90 Main Battle Tank. However it's mass production         began in 1992 only. The first production series consisted from 132 main         battle tanks and overall country requirement was about 600 tanks.Â <br><br>Â Â          The Type 90 Main Battle Tank has a classical design. Engine-transmission         compartment is placed rear, driving compartment is placed left side in         the hull's front. Ammunition load for the main gun is placed right side         from the driver. Tank's commander and gunner are placed in rotating         turret.<br><br>Â Â  It has a         welded hull and turret. It's armor is multi-layered and combined with ceramic         elements. Tanks armor is made by "Kyoto Ceramics         Company". Frontal hull's armor is greatly inclined in elevation providing         additional protection. The Type 90 armor features superior resistance.         Unfortunately almost all remaining hull and turret parts are welded         vertically.<br><br>Â Â  Tank's         main armament is an Rh-M-120 the 120-mm smoothbore gun. It was designed         by German company "Rheinmetall" and is built in Japan under         license. Similar main gun is used with the "Leopard         2" main battle tanks. It is stabilized in two planes with         elevation aiming angles from -12 to +15 degrees. The Type 90 Main Battle         Tank is fed by the same loads like the "Leopard         2" and M1A1 "Abrams".         Main gun reloading mechanism was designed by "Mitsubishi" and         has an original design. Automatically there are reloaded 20 rounds         placed in the turret rear. The rest ammunition is placed in the hull         near the driver. Automatic reloading mechanism allowed to decrease one         crew member.<br><br>Â Â          Additional armament consists from 7.62-mm coaxial machine gun and         12.7-mm anti-aircraft machine gun mounted near commander's hatch.         It is fitted with a smoke grenade launchers as well.<br><br>Â Â  Type 90 fire control         system includes laser rangefinder, ballistic computer, combined         day-night sight, telescopic gunner sight, commander control device with         combined sight and also tank mechanisms control system designed by         "Mitsubishi". The Type 90 Main Battle Tank features one of the         best fire control system in the world.<br><br>Â Â          It is powered by "Mitsubishi" ZG 10-cylinder turbocharged         engine. Engine reaches 1 500 hp. power under 2 400 rounds per minute. It         has a 30 hp per tone power-to-weight ratio what is a really impressive         result. The Type 90 is fitted with a hydro-mechanic transmission with         automatic planetary gear box. It has 4 forward and 2 backward gears.         Transmission is built in one module with engine.<br><br>Â Â          Chassis suspension is combined. Two forward and two backward bearing         rolls from the each side have hydro-pneumatic suspension. The other         bearing rolls are completed with a torsion suspension. Such suspension         allows to change tank's ground clearance from 200 to 600 mm. Furthermore         it allows to incline tank from one side as well. This system is quiet         actual for Japan's upland terrain. Tracks are made from steel with a         rubber-metallic hinges and removable rubber pads.<br><br>Â Â          The Type 90 Main Battle Tank reaches maximum road speed in 70 km/h. It         manages vertical step in 1 meter, 2.7 meter wide ditch and fords         unprepared 2 meter depth water obstacle.<br><br>Â Â          It is completed with Nuclear, Biological, Chemical protection, automatic         fire prevention system, thermo smoke equipment, laser notifying report         system and other.Â <br><br>Â Â          On the Type 90 Main Battle Tank there are based later vehicles:<br><br>Â Â          - Type 90 Armored Recovery Vehicle;<br><br>Â Â          - Tank Bridge-Layer which was intended to replace similar out-dated Type         67 Vehicle based on the Type 61 Medium Tank chassis.<br><br>Advantages<br><br>Â Â  The Type 90 is       a modern, well armed, and strongly defended combat vehicle. It has a great       power-to-weight ratio. Tank is fitted with a very accurate fire control       system. Tank is completed with a reloading mechanism unlike it's prototype       the "Leopard 2" Main Battle Tank.<br><br>Disadvantages<br><br>Â Â  The main       disadvantage is very expensive price. One more disadvantage is that Type 90       has vertical turret boards which makes it a good target for an anti-tank       weapons.</div>

The air-conditioning in the tanks will draw up excessive moisture and provide crew comfort. The vision and lens fogging up issues should not be too difficult an issue to resolve after all , SM1 does have quite a state-of-the-art tank sight and does not suffice this problem. The Tank sights could have a little electric heater to remove any fogs on the glass or lenses.<br><br>Except for the cost, I really think that Lelerc could be a good platform of SAF.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Pulling back to the main topic of this thread - being about a new tank for SAF, or should I say tank<strong>s</strong> being plural.<br><br>As for the light tank, too many rumours (including sources from Janes) cited that a locally designed light tank will be developed to replace the SM1. No reason to doubt this as ST has demonstrated the capability to design and produce ground vehicles. The latest Primus has proven their skills and know-how albeit they have gotten help from United Defense.<br><br>My guess is a locally design light tank will come from the ST production plant, with UD components, including a 120mm gun, possible a modified M8 turret, US or Israeli tank sight, typical smoke grenade launcher 76mm SGL (SDS-93), etc.  The chassis is most like a modified Bionix with some applique armour.<br><br>I hope DSTA and ST takes some additional thingy into consideration:<br><br>1. the new light tank should be able to "amour up" like the M8 AGS to protect it from new gen ATGM and AP rounds. It should be, when required, be able to add on reactive armour or additional ceremics or carbon armour.<br><br>2. The new light tank should be able to fire on the move, with fully stabalised sight and main gun.<br><br>3. The new light tank should probably provide hunter-killer capability through providing the tank commander a panaromic sight and TV that provides the gunner sight image, or a CCITV.<br><br>4. The new light tank should probably provide an adequate active defensive aid suite including laser warner and jammer, IR jammer, millimeter wave warner and jammer, and the SGL being able to launch IR and radar decoys.<br><br>5. The new light tank should probably provide some battlefield management system to link all friendly tanks in a network centric environment. Tank commanders should be able to know where the friends and enemies are and where are the fire/kill zones.<br><br>6. The new light tank's gun should probably be able to fire guided munition that can engage both land and aerial targets.<br><br>7. The new light tank should provide high level of crew protection and adequate fire suppression in case of being hit<br><br>8. The new light tank should have a autoloader and can be manned by a crew of 3 (or 2) in extreme cases.<br><br>9. The tank should have a low ground pressure, low acoustic, IR and radar signature, high mobility (thrust to weight ration must be better or equivalent to Bionix)<br><br>10. Last but not least, the tank must be ergonomic friendly, realiable, easy to maintain (on field and off field), has a width less than 3m,  has a height less than 2.8m, has a weight not more than 30 tons after putting on addition applique armour; easily configurable (eg, adding an MG on top of the main gun barrel, or even the AGL, add remote controlled MG on the roof)<br><br>How's that folks? he hee...<br><br>Impossible?<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Good write up!  Joe Black <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"><br><br>For your Pt 1, think it will be quite difficult with current passive armour technology to have a AFV protected up to new gen ATGM, especially against top attack ATGM and yet below 30 tons(Pt10).<br><br>Totally agreed with your Pt your Pt 2,3,5,7,8 and 9.<br>But for your Pt 4 and 6, you are talking abt many high cost stuffs and some are  under development and not even being fielded yet.<br><br>With all the ingredients that you have proposed, I think it will the  most expensive light tank in the world, maybe even more expensive as compare to upgraded M-60 Sabra!!! <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br><br>For me , it should be cost effective with sufficient protection against a RPG type threats( the weight consideration of &lt; 30 tons), a laser warning devices, maybe in the future if the cost is low enough a active defence against ATGM.<br><br>As for mobility, the road speed should be at around 70 km/hr, as for ground pressure it should be as low as possible, I prefer below 0.8Kgf/sq cm especially in the rainforest terrain of SEA.<br>I certainly hope that it will not have a high ground pressure like the Primus.<br><br>As for firepower, I hope like you suggested, a Hunter/Killer FCS that give a edge to fire off the first round, and of course armed with latest CTG L50 120mm low recoil gun that could fire Nato standard 120mm round. Maybe we could also use a similar Israeli tank missiles that have a range of 8km.<br><br>I think the main purpose of new light tank will be for direct fire support and I hope some tank killer role.<br><br>My $0.02 worth.<br><br>I heard a rumour from another forum :<br><blockquote>I saw the Thunderbolt turret being porposed on the extended BIONIX chassis (as used in the PRIMUS SPG)at the UDLP stand in Singapore during AA2004.<br>I predicted in AA2002 that we would see a BIONIX light tank with 7 road-wheel stations. We saw the PRIMUS, a 7 roadwheel station chassis and this....which makes me kinda pleased.</blockquote>Did anyone see/heard the same the thing from UDLP stand in the AA2004?<br><br><img src="http://www.ravenshield-fr.com/images/RS_animation4.gif"><br><br></div>
