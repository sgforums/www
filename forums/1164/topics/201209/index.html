            <div class='col-md body'>I think the patent thing is over on the AR15/M16 rifle.. COlt is still tryingto hold on to a product they don;t already own.  FN is making M16 for the US military! COlt Is only doing the M4.. but with the new stuff comming in like the HK416! COlt is losing its foothold everyday.<br><br>Now we have so many good Mfr on the Ar15,M16... Bushmaster, Stagarms, Rockriver arms, CMMG etc etc... all make better product than the COlt<br><br>COlt has shoot themselve in the foot by not producing anything innovative .. they neglect the military and civilian mkt ! only now they are trying to come back.. Such a sad case to see them in this stage.<br><br>Takes competition to wake them up! HEard they are comming out with a piston based M16... which they should have done yrs back from them IMHO.<br><br>NOw we have so much choices on M16 products.. COlt would be last in my list!<br><br>DAveC</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>No doubt about that, changing mags in a bullpup will be a pickle even if you are quite well versed. But I feel it is offset by the fact that it is easier to use standing up then a normal design (important in FIBUA).<br><br>In a sense you are trading off a few moments to reload for 30 rounds of easier shooting... which is probably more important then reloading time. I think more soldiers are killed by missing their shots when they are taking them instead of while reloading. I find a bullpup much easier to aim as well.<br><br>Clearing corners from our non master side? I'm not sure how that's harder given the tatics could be altered but not being able to shoot from a left-handed position might be a reason.<br><br>But then again its a matter of tatics, to play up the strengths of the bullpup while making up for the weakness.</div>

            </div>
            <div class='col-md body'>Wouldn't the shorter length of the M4 be almost similar to a bullpup without the reloading issues?<br><br>I agree with you in that the bullpup is nice to handle in a urban enviroment versus the standard  M16 due to its shorter.  But find the weight a big drawback.  Especially if the poor fellow carries the eventual M203/SAR21 (if it ever comes out).</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>agree that the bullpup feels much more balance and thus stability on firing.. as for most bullpup, ( I have not shot the SAR21) but comparing to some of the bullpup I have handle like the AUG, Valmet 82,FN P2000 it is plaque by mediocre trigger pull. AUG is notorious on that,<br><br>for clearing CQB type actions, bullpup is more how should I say awkward than conventional arms like the MP5, M4 type setup.  less flexible when you are on the wrong side of the corner. since the ejection port will be at your face!...<br><br>I guess bullppup over conventional rifle design is a choice thing ! Some people like one over the other....  BMW or Benz!<br><br>M4 having a shorter barrel will be disadvantage to have especially for the 5.56 ammo which needs the longer barrel to get the extra ummph when hitting target.<br><br>Don;t get me wrong, throw me a AUG or P2000 I can still do well!!.<br><br>DaveC!</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>The sluggish trigger pull on bullpups come from their complex system of linkage rods and stuff... the SAR 21 is supposed to solve (or at least reduce) this problem by using a solid sliding plate... I haven't shot any other bullpups before so I don't know how it fares against them (but some reports say it's an improvement).<br><br>The trigger pull is certainly clunkier opposed to the M-16 (as expected), but I don't think it really makes me a worse shot in all that I have used it, and I could still get double taps with it during section life fire.<br><br>So it works... for me. For length it is certainly produces far more muzzle velocity then the M4 (thanks to the standard length barrel), which is quite important given the 5.56 is a small round, and the velocity can be critical in making sure if a round fails and fragments inside the target's body from the high energies as opposed to a slower round simply passing through and leaving little more then a minor penetration wound (unless a vital is hit).</div>
