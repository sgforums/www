It is on you, you do not have to worry that in the heat of the battle you cannot find it or force to leave it behind. You can reach it without seeing.<br><br>Even in fox hole !!! what happen if a grenade get thrown in ? You got time to grab you picnic mags? No you jump out with SBO and rifle ...   Also you there is no time to bend down to look for a drop mag .... the moment you stop shooting your hole will be over run ....!!!<br><br>Remember that is why a good saw gunner or soldier alway know how many rounds he shot, so he will knows when he is about to change his mags .... He must plan ahead, under which cover he will change his mag, from which pouch that mag is ....<br></div>

Fricking 16kg for a reservist is no joke.<br><br>Sometimes during breaks at route march I had to get my buddies to pull me up. And boarding 3 tonner they automatically give me a helping hand.<br><br>And I was very fit at that time.<br><br>Once during FOFO assault I yelled after my PC to pull me out from the comms trench after him. I couldn't push myself out of the comms trench fter a whole night of marching and this was our 3rd assault since sun down and the sun was now rising for the next day.<br><br>After that I told my PC that using the 77 set all of us reservist runners in Bravo Company cannot tahan. And worst than that, we are supposed to keep up with the PC - the most important man - not slow him down.<br><br>Furthermore, the platoons only needed to keep in contact with the other Bravo platoons and Bravo Company HQ. So the distance usually isn't more than 10km for comms.<br><br>For many excercises after that, we were issued hand held sets when possible and the 77 set stayed in the HQ rovers.</div>
