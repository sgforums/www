            <div class='col-md body'>Most pictures of the Ultimax that I have seen being used by foreign armies and mercenaries featured the 100-round drum.<br><br>These people wouldn't be buying the Ultimax-100 only to use it as a Ultimax-30.<br><br>Though I, too, had my doubts about the drum, I can only assume that it works well enough, for people like the Indos to have bought quantities of it.<br><br>Interesting thing about belted 5.56 ammo. The AFP (Philippines Armed Forces) bought Minimis over the Ultimax and then found that belted 5.56 ammo was either too expensive or scarce since the Philippines didn't produce them. And 2 people on the Timawa site reported that they preferred the Ultimax over the Minimi as the Ultimax was lighter and more accurate, and tons cheaper. But most of all, it didn't require the production of belted ammo.<br><br>But drums vs belt is a debate requiring its own thread and it's been done many times and on this forum, too.<br><br>I agree with Dave's comment about hand-loading the drum but as someone pointed out, you can hand load up to 50rds or something.<br><br>I'm sure Sullivan considered all the different drum systems before deciding on the current Ultimax system. No drum system had worked well so far.<br><br>The Russians traditionally favoured drums but even they had given it up. They had drums for their PPD and PPsh-41 SMGs. They had drums for their RPK (SAW AK-47). The 75-rd drums were "heavy, expensive and hard to load" according to Modern Firearms. They were loaded the traditional way from the lip.<br><br>THe RPD and German MG-34 snail drums aren't really drums as they nothing more than a container for the belt ammo.<br><br>AS far as I know, the Germans never used drum mags except for one on the MP-18 SMG during the WW2.<br><br>I also remember seeing pics of a HK LMG with a big capacity box mag with a transparent back.<br><br>Now only the PLA (QBZ-95 LMG) and SAF (Ultimax100) operate drums as far as I can recall offhand.<br><br>The US military had experience with 1 drum system in the Thompson SMG and was not satisfied with the Thompson drum. They also used the now-dead "pan" magazine in the Lewis Gun.<br><br>So it will be a real surprise if the US military does decide on the Ultimax. It is often very hard to change deeply entrenched perceptions as we all know too well. Even though it was designed by Jim Sullivan.<br><br>Will the Ultimax be phased out was a question I asked before. One of its main advantage of sharing mags with the rifleman is gone out the window with the STUPID decision to adopt non-M16 mags for the SAF SAR-21.<br><br>Anyone who says a better M16 mag can't be made should realise that our old-fashioned SAF aluminium mags aren't used by most countries still using STANAG mags. HK have made stainless steel ones. Diemaco have their own etc etc.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>If I am suddenly ambushed or other desperate scenario I sure hope the SAW guy isn't thinking of conserving ammo. If he has to empty a whole drum then he has to. And I think the Ultimax will still be accurate in short range fullauto long bursts due to its low rate of fire and controllability. You can think about lecturing him on ammo conservation if you are still alive after contact.<br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>The saw might be heavier than the m16 but the fact ther's a foregrip i always found it easier to carry and swing around since the CoG is more balance. Compared to the M203/M16 that i always carry....different stroke different folks i guess.<br><br>The SAW can put a round (or three) up your nostrils at 100m. With tracers, i dont see much of an accuracy problem for even further distance. considering it's amazingly low recoil. Saw is a good suppressive fire that can actually hit something. You dont stand around when someone is firing bursts.  One shot might miss...but a cluster of three to five....<br><br>My 2 cents worth.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>For the fellow (i cant quote the buttons all disappear for some reason) who asked what's the use of a 30 rd mag for a saw when you squeeze at 5 to at most 10 times you have to reload.<br><br>Ans: You are not rambo.  You provide cover fire equivalent to -THREE- M16s. So while -they reload- you fire bit by bit. When you reload, you have three people to cover you.  Imagine what you can do if you have the 100 rd drum.<br><br>Regarding the penetration of the 5.56mm.<br><br>If i remember correctly, the barrel length of the SAW is much longer than our M16s or SAR for that matter.  Increase barrel length = increase power as well no?  I follow the concept for sniper rifle. What you cannot shoot through with M16, you have a been chance doing with the SAW.<br><br>Regarding our SAWs accuracy, I say again, most decent first timers can probably hit you with a ten round spray while experts can put rounds up your nostrils @ 100 metre one handed. It's like hack with aim-bot.<br><br>One thing though, you can clean until you grow old and you will still find carbon in one of those things!</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>SAW front heavy for reducing the upwards recoil (is this right?)...any way its for controlability<br><br>it is better to pin the enemy in a controled short burst rather than a full long burst... meaning you shot what you realy aim instead of spraying the area and hope it hit some thing ( but dont get me wrong ..i didnt say it is wrong in combat to shoot and spray like that like rambo, because the longer your enemy keep his head down the better)<br><br>im sure if your sargeant saw you spray the whole mag onto just one target paper he will smack you in the head and make you ran for 5 mile in combat gear.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>"From his work with Stoner on the M16, Sullivan moved to Singapore, to work on a new light machine gun for Chartered Industries, now known as Singapore Technologies. The outcome was the 5.56mm Ultimax light machine gun, noted by experts as one of the <strong>most manageable light machine guns in the world.</strong> The secret of its manageability is in SullivanÂ’s patented counter recoil mechanism, making the <strong>Ultimax not just a manageable full-automatic weapon, but a machine gun that can be aimed.</strong>"<br><br><a href="http://www.nationaldefensemagazine.org/issues/2001/Nov/Focus_on.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.nationaldefensemagazine.org/issues/2001/Nov/Focus_on.htm</a></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>GPMG and SAW serve different purposes.... you can't have that many GPMG everywhere, every section..they are too heavy and immobile and will affect the mobility of the entire unit.<br><br>It is still the world's lightest SAW, but front-heavy due to barrel length.<br><br>There's no exaggeration when SAF claims it can be shoulder-fired. It really can, and very accurately.<br><br>The SAW is meant for automatic covering fire in a section. Very effective.<br><br>Those who say they are inaccurate must have never been to the army. The Ultimax, due to the longer barrel is much more powerful and accurate than the M-16.<br><br>The magazine it takes is the M-16-type modified with two holes on the side, it also accepts a 100-round drum magazine, which will be standard-issue in real operations.<br><br></div>
