ADF is not worshipped by Singaporeans as you might hope to think it is.<br>2. We are not dumb assholes.<br>3. You have not shown yourself to be capable of rational debate about any shortcomings that may be found in your data.<br>4. You have admitted that you wish to ultimately drive people away from Australia because you and YOU ALONE have this impression and puerile assumption that we are sheep and that we live, work and play in Australia as ignorant fools.<br>5. The RSAF does not need your analysis, specious as it is, to help in doctrine or planning. We are far more capable than you think. What makes you think that HD Air Plans or Air Ops require your input or that your heavily one-sided posts about the ADF will influence organisational thinking?<br>6. Your previous attempt at discussing the Collins-class submarine has shown that your data is outdated and the accusations you have made about the SSK are inaccurate and have been solved eons ago.

They still have plenty of incidents and issues to debate about from Dragon Skin Armour, Seawolf (cut from one whole class to just three boats), JSF (seriously delayed), next gen small arms (really seriously delayed) to the Stryker.<br><br>Frankly you should at the very least read on the recent combat experience of the Australians in Afganistan, in which they made a very good accounting of themselves.<br><br>So it seems the only "sys failure", is only in your brain.

King Cutnpaste doesn't offer any points of his own - he just picks up any and all clippings about Australia that have the slightest hint of bad news in them and gleefully plasters them all over the forum.  It's indiscriminate, and the law of averages states that he'll occasionally post something that makes sense, but that's by accident rather than design.
