(Taken from the Accident Investigation Report (AIB).) On 19 May 2004, the pilot of an F-16 aircraft was killed when the aircraft he was flying impacted the ground in Arizona. The Republic of Singapore Air Force pilot and aircraft were stationed at Luke AFB. The aircraft crashed onto the Tohono O'Odham Nation away from any man-made structures with incidental damage to the immediate terrain and vegetation. No other injuries or death resulted.<br>The mishap aircraft was on a night opposed surface attack tactics mission with a flight of three F-16 aircraft. The mishap occurred on the second engagement between the three aircraft when the mishap aircraft executed a maneuver from approximately 14,000 feet MSL, that resulted in the mishap aircraft impacting the ground in a nearly vertical dive. There was no attempt by the mishap pilot to eject.</blockquote>Spend millions of your hard earned money on airplane and training pilot but still can lose airplane, if this is a commercial company is this acceptable?<br><br>Note that now the own SAF involved in making failed bionix tank version for ur hard earn tax money----<br><blockquote> Stemming from a need to replace/augment the current fleet of AMX-13 SM1 light tanks, MINDEF and United Defense conducted a series of studies to mount the Thunderbolt Armoured Gun System's 120mm cannon turret (and alternatively, 105mm) on a variety of chassis, namely an extended Bionix chassis, the Universal Combat Vehicle Platform (which the SSPH Primus was based on) and a variant of the Thunderbolt's chassis. Early extensive attempts to mount an Oto Melara 120mm turret on the Bionix have been unsuccesful. [1]<br>MINDEF has since decided to procure refurbished Leopard 2A4 MBTs.

Although the 59 second-hand tanks were projected as a bargain at just $550 million, including training, spares and some maintenance, this is just the start of the spending. The defence forces are being altered to accommodate them, to no convincing strategic purpose.<br><br>The 68-tonne behemoths may provide the ultimate in air-conditioned battlefield comfort and security for their four-man crews, but the difficulty for Australia will be getting them to battle, or anywhere. They are too big and heavy for existing rolling stock on the railway to Darwin, where they will be based, or for any ships or aircraft in the present navy or air force inventory. <strong>They are too heavy for any road bridges in the Northern Territory, let alone those in the South-East Asian or Pacific neighbourhood. </strong>They chew up four times as much fuel as the army's existing Leopard tanks to travel the same distance.<br><br>But not to worry, those helpful American arms salesmen have sold us four C-17 heavy-lift transport aircraft that were awaiting buyers on the Boeing production line, for just $2 billion. And anyway, we don't need to transport them anywhere. They are just for training the crews. When we assign our tank forces to the next American operation, the US army will have identical-model Abrams tanks positioned on the battlefield for Australian crews to operate. Presumably they'll be allowed to fly their own flag.<br><br>The Abrams deal is a sign of the way the Iraq intervention is distorting defence policy, quite aside from the debate about its place in the campaign against terrorism. The army-based expeditionary force has been raised to cult-like status. Defence doctrine has been shifted significantly with little scrutiny.<br><br>Where defence chiefs once envisaged a nimble, "knowledge-based" force for the new century, using intelligence and communications to make up for limited numbers and firepower, now there is talk of a "hardened" force able to take part in high-intensity battle of a kind we are unlikely to see in our region, outside perhaps in Korea.<br><br>This profligacy is coming at a time when "block obsolescence" has put heavy demands on the defence budget, not to mention the billion-dollar fiasco of the navy's helicopters. Spending on capital equipment for the defence forces over the next 10 years is already slated at $54 billion, assuming no major overruns or hidden costs. In addition, Canberra recently announced a<strong> $10 billion plan to raise two new army battalions, one of them an armoured unit, at a time when the forces are struggling to maintain their present modest strength of 52,000 and just before a demographic shift will reduce the traditional recruiting pool of 17- to 20-year-olds. Despite past claims by government ministers that geography no longer matters, policy reviews still endorse the longstanding, bipartisan agreement that the defence priority is Australia and its immediate region. The Abrams tanks don't fit into this, and seem destined for white elephant status</strong>.</blockquote>4.<strong><a href="http://www.sgforums.com/?action=search&amp;search_str=aussie" rel="nofollow">u can read my mind,if u understand my poor English,to see if<br>i am bias or just ''copy and write''?</a></strong><br><br><img src="http://www.aspi.org.au/Admin/pubImages/Special_report_lg.GIF"><br>5.pl read how Aussie government funded body wrote about<br>the might ADF!I suggest u down load this 16 pages report<br>and digest it.It is not fair ADF if i quote pieces meals.<br><br>http://www.aspi.org.au/publications/publication_details.aspx?ContentID=110&amp;pubtype=10<br><strong><a href="http://www.aspi.org.au/publications/publication_details.aspx?ContentID=110&amp;pubtype=10" rel="nofollow">Improving Defence Management,Monday, 22 January 2007,</a></strong>---Mark Thomson held a number of positions in(Aussie) Defence working in the<br>areas of capability development and resource<br>management.

In one instance an M1A1 took a direct hit to the ammunition storage area, all of the rounds inside were detonated, however the crew survived and carried on with their mission. </strong><br><br>Australian Warrant Officer Joe Day who was serving on exchange with the US Marine Corps 1st Light Armoured Reconnaissance Battalion during operations in Iraq commented that from his observations the M1A1 was the 'king of the battlefield and that light armour and infantry couldn't survive without tanks and guns'.<br><br><strong>Warrant Officer Day also saw an M1A1 take a direct hit from an Iraqi T- 62 and then continue on and destroy the enemy tank. </strong><br><br><strong>The motor and transmission on the M1A1 performed so well in Iraq on the very long drives through difficult terrain that the US Tank Automotive and Armaments Command are not planning any further work on trying to extend the transmission hours as they do not need it. </strong><br><br>The M1A1 AIM vehicle that Australia will procure will not be equipped with either Depleted Uranium armour or munitions. The armour on offer is of an advanced composite design, which is in accord with our capability requirements.<br><br>The new tank will fire an advanced kinetic energy Tungsten penetrator against vehicles and a multi-purpose round for infantry support. The tank is powered by a gas turbine engine, the AGT-1500. Gas turbine engines, including the AGT-1500, are truly multi-fuel. They offer excellent power/weight ratios compared to diesel engines.<br><br>They have a very good cold-start capability (unlike a diesel), with smooth torque and low vibration (an advantage for crews and sensitive onboard systems). The gas turbine motor is also substantially quieter than a traditional diesel tank engine ( like that in a Leopard 1). Additional tactical refuelling trucks to provide fuel for the tanks in the field are included in the $A550m package.<br><br>Outside of the US Army and US Marine Corps the M1A1 is operated by Egypt, Saudi Arabia and Kuwait.<br><br>The M1A1 AIM tank was selected for the following reasons:<br><br>The M1A1 AIM has the best overall survivability of the options considered. It offers battlefield proven protection for its crews.<br><br>The M1A1 AIM in Australian service will be very similar to the remainder of the large user community. It is part of a large fleet with stable, known operating costs, which will be in service beyond 2020.<br><br>They will be configured as part of a fleet of 3,500 similar vehicles across the world. These particular vehicles will be very similar to over 2,500 vehicles operated by the US to at least 2020.<br><br>The M1A1 AIM has the best potential to support network centric warfare. It offers a proven integrated and highly capable radio and battlespace management system.<br><br>The M1A1 AIM is assessed to have the least technical acquisition risk as the vehicle type and configuration for Australian service is already in production. It is a proven design, which is already in contract.<br><br><strong>The M1A1 AIM is the right tank for Australian service. It is a highly survivable and affordable vehicle, with excellent potential for network centric warfare. The M1A1 provides the best value for Commonwealth dollar with low production and technical risk. </strong><br><br>The Foreign Military Sales (FMS) offer for the M1A1 includes, spares, training, support vehicles, Armoured Recovery Vehicles, simulation systems, radios and ancillary equipment as part of the overall package.<br><br>The M1A1 that ADF will procure are essentially remanufactured vehicles. They have been returned to a zero miles zero hours condition. This will provide substantial cost benefits in comparison to purchasing new vehicles.<br><br>The M1A1 Abrams weighs less than 63,000 kilograms (&lt;63 tonnes) when fully combat laden. <strong>This is only slightly heavier than the Leopard 2</strong> (which we use) and is lighter than the Challenger takes that were considered. All three tank options that were considered are within 1000 kg of each other in combat configuration. In transport configuration the M1A1 will weigh around 59-60 tonnes.<br><br><strong>Additional Heavy Equipment Transporters and trailers will be procured under Project Land 121.<br><br>The crane that loaded tanks in Darwin would be capable of doing the same for M1. We have an ongoing discussion about strategic rail transport in Australia and the issue of appropriate rolling stock will continue to be discussed.</strong> </blockquote></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote> Strategic Rationale for the Acquisition of a new Tank<br><br>The thinking underlying the decision to purchase the Abrams M1A1 reflects the same strategic rationale which the Government outlined in the Defence 2000 White Paper.<br>That white paper stated that the Government would ensure that Â‘our land forces will have the combat weight they need to achieve their missions without undue riskÂ’.<br>TodayÂ’s decision follows through on the GovernmentÂ’s commitment and is aligned with existing strategic policy as expressed in the White Paper.<br>A wide range of extremely lethal, concealable, high technology weapons are becoming available to our potential adversaries. These weapons can be carried, concealed and operated by one person. They are cheap and accessible.<br>This means that, even when we do not expect to meet major opposition (such as in peacekeeping or evacuation operations), our soldiers can encounter, without warning, highly lethal weapons of a standard that simply did not exist a few years ago.<br>It would be entirely irresponsible of the Government to send AustraliaÂ’s young men and women into harmÂ’s way without giving them adequate protection and the means to achieve their missions.<br>Capable tanks provide this capability. Independent scientific studies have shown that, where capable tanks are present, they reduce friendly casualties by a factor of six, and almost double the chance of mission success. Because of their precision firepower and excellent sensor systems, they also reduce casualties to innocent bystanders and prevent collateral environmental damage.<br>The current tank is becoming increasingly vulnerable to a proliferation of sophisticated anti-armour weapons and clearly we couldnÂ’t continue with it in that threat environment on the battlefield.<br>The Government has accepted the Chief of ArmyÂ’s argument that combined arms teams, including capable infantry, tanks, armoured vehicles, artillery, Special Forces and other elements, are essential for the Army to fulfil its role.</blockquote></div>

".......</blockquote>2.<br><strong><a href="http://www.yawningbread.org/arch_2005/yax-403.htm" rel="nofollow">An indictment of failure english culture, </a></strong>--<br><br><blockquote>... Up until the 1960s, and even in schools where English was the medium of instruction, no one assumed that the children spoke English as a family language. Consequently, the methods used were those of teaching English as a second language, which meant very careful attention paid to enlarging vocabulary and instilling the rules of grammar. Much time was spent on grammar drills to hone the pupils' skills at things like the future perfect tense, the subjunctive and the fine shades of meaning among similar words. See example at right.<br>However, in the 1970s, a rapid conversion of all schools into English-medium ones took place, as the government shut down Chinese, Malay and Tamil-medium schools. As demand for English teachers grew, so standards fell. Furthermore, geography, physics or carpentry teachers were also required to use English in their classes, but as these adults were not using English as their first language, it meant that the students would hear broken English from those teachers.<br>In addition, the rapid expansion of English-medium education meant that students from families that never used English at home had to use English in school. This was unlike the previous decades when the English-medium schools tended to attract pupils from homes that did speak some English. Just when the task of teaching English became wider and harder, the difficulty of getting teachers who spoke good English became greater.<br>At around the same time, the Education ministry experimented with American teaching methods. Those were the days when British prestige had sunk to new lows and even the Sterling Pound had to be bailed out by the IMF. America was the shining example of modernity. These teaching methods involved more listening and speaking than being drilled in grammar rules.<br>It was a hopelessly misguided change, for the linguistic background in Singapore was nothing like White middle-class America, where children absorbed English with mother's milk. Learning by immersion and example cannot work if the environment was saturated with bad English.<br>(Nowadays, the scales have fallen from our eyes. Every time we see some American write on any bulletin board something like, "What I want to know is whether your expected to tip...." we see living proof that teaching language without grammar drills simply doesn't work.)<br>Another American idiocy imported into our education system was the multiple-choice test. I myself don't remember any use of multiple-choice testing when it came to English in my schooldays. We had to write long essays. We had to read and re-read dense passages followed by some questions to test our understanding of the text, and those questions had to be answered with a paragraph or two. We had to paraphrase other sentences or condense an entire paragraph into a key sentence to capture the gist of it. We had to pen telegrams in exactly 25 words (which I thought was a useless skill since telegrams were obsolescent, only to discover decades later that I can tap out more concentrated sms messages than most). And we had to transpose sentences into other time frames to test our mastery of tenses, or insert new ideas into an existing sentence by means of additional clauses.<br>How multiple choice questions would teach students to do all that with language, I cannot imagine.<br>Thus, except for a small minority, the masses picked up, not English, but a corrupted form of it.<br>More politics was to come. The annual Speak Mandarin Campaign confused priorities. Together with political campaigns against western "yellow culture", official veneration of Confucianism and emphasis on our "roots", "aping the West" became a liability. It was a small step from here to a general ridicule of people with perfect English and internationally acceptable intonation.<br>Meanwhile, the economics-trained technocrats in our government said that Singapore must preserve our competitive advantages vis-Ã -vis a rising China, and one of them is the fact that we're an English-speaking country.<br>Lo! we're now officially an English-speaking country, because the government said so. Therefore, what we speak must be English. If it sounds like English and the government says it's English, it's English. Since we have arrived, why is there a need to make an effort to improve our English?<br>.....</blockquote>3.Am I anti singgie again?

Serious training incidents are relatively rare, but they were also rarely publicised or discussed in the media until recently. In 2003, training safety standard began to come under increased scrutiny when Second Sergeant Hu Enhuai of the Singapore Guards died during a Combat Survival Training course conducted by the Commandos on 21 August [1]. Four Commandos were charged in court a year later [2] for carrying out the "dunking" procedure deemed inappriopriate for training purposes.<br>Other recent incidents include the death of a regular serviceman, Second Sergeant Rajagopal Thirukumaran of Singapore Guards after a run during the selection for the Ranger course conducted by the CTW on 3 September 2003 [3], and a heli-rappelling incident on 14 July 2005 in which a regular Commando, First Sergeant Shiva s/o Mohan, and a foreign serviceman were killed. [4]<br>On 15 June 2005, another regular serviceman, Second Sergeant Ong Jia Hui, 24, drowned during training, even though four instructors were within visible range from him at the Changi Naval Base.

While such cases tend to be dramatic and attract lots of media attention, I feel that the danger from picking up harmful habits is much greater. Today, there was a front page report in the papers about 2 young men who were infected with the deadly HIV when they were doing NS. This reminds me of a case I encountered back in the 1970Â’s when I was a platoon commander in 30SCE in Mandai. One day, one of my men came to me for permission to go to Middle Road Hospital for treatment, twice a week (or something like that). At that time, Middle Road Hospital (hope I got the name correct) specialized in sexually transmitted diseases.<br><br>Â“You have VD is it?Â” I asked. Â“YesÂ”, he replied somewhat shyly. But to my horror, I detected a hint of pride in his voice. Apparently, my men have been organising tours to Hatyai for their R&amp;R after they completed their BMT. Some of these young, immature kids were proud that they finally achieved manhood, and even have the evidence to prove it.<br><br>Another sad statistic to share with my readers. At the beginning of their 6-month course under me, there were only 2 smokers in the whole platoon of nearly 30 men. By the end of the course, there were only 2 non-smokers left, myself being one of them.<br><br>We know that the SAF is well-aware of this problem and is taking proactive measures to address it. I hope they succeed. But for todayÂ’s NSmen, [b]I believe, the dangers may have increased considerably since my time.</strong></blockquote><img src="http://luckypuppy.bravehost.com/MADDOGJET/mishaps/f16crash.jpg"><br>do u want your son and daughter 2 be in such an aircraft?<br></strong></div>
