The crew attempted takeoff on runway 05R, which had been closed for repairs, instead of the assigned runway 05L (which runs parallel to 05R). Due to poor visibility in the heavy rain, the flight crew did not see that construction equipment had been parked on runway 05R. The aircraft collided with the machinery and broke up into pieces. A massive fire followed. 79 of 159 passengers and 4 of 20 crew members died in the accident.<br><br>Investigation findings<br>An investigation into the accident was conducted by the Taiwan Aviation Safety Council (ASC). The final report was issued by the ASC on 24 April 2002. In the report section "Findings Related to Probable Causes," which detailed factors that played a major role in the circumstances leading to the accident, <strong>it was stated that the flight crew did not review the taxi route, despite having all the relevant charts, and as a result did not know the aircraft had entered the wrong runway. Upon entering the wrong runway, the flight crew had neglected to check the paravisual display (PVD) and the primary flight display (PFD), which would have indicated that the aircraft was lined up on the wrong runway</strong>. According to the ASC, these errors, coupled with the imminent arrival of the typhoon and the poor weather conditions, caused the flight crew to lose situational awareness and led them to attempt to take off from the wrong runway.</blockquote></div>

It must have been demeaning for CDF and the secretary to sit through the briefing knowing full well that the minister had failed to involve or consult them.<br><br>The minister simply ignored both his principal military adviser, the CDF, and his departmental secretary responsible for a $22 billion defence budget.

            <div class='col-md body'>can u imagine that SAF has not been consulted when their elite commando trainer is going to be change training safety regulation and invent new dangerous training?<br><br><strong><a href="http://sgcollect.com/forum/lofiversion/index.php/t30907-150.html" rel="nofollow">This really happened in Singapore</a></strong>---repulsive, shocking, senseless training<br><br><blockquote><strong>lawyers described the training conducted as<br>"repulsive, shocking and senseless". </strong></blockquote>Be patient.Read some.<br>The Commando trainer put his head on chopping board<br>by claiming this.<br><br>The bottom line is:<br>Has Commando called for any TSR for comparsions<br>of trainings,before Singgie Commando decide use dunking?<br><br><blockquote>4 commandos have been officially charged for the dunking death of Sgt Hu. Readers will remember that incident at Tekong where they conducted the now infamous "capture, escape and survive" course. Sgt Hu drowned while a few others escaped death but not without injury. After the public and media firestorm, Mindef vowed to make training more transparent and get to the bottom of the matter.<br><br>While this particular charging seems reminiscent of the Navy incident (Navy ship crashes into private one, 4 sergeants die, 3 on board charged), to my mind it's a totally different boat.<br><br>In the Navy incident, those in charge were on the boat and hence any mistakes made or orders passed were from the boat. Hence the accountable ones were also on the boat. IMO, there was complete accountability.<br><br>In this dunking incident, the incident occurred in a training camp, where the "tekan" sessions were routine and regimented. Yet, what do we have? 4 junior officers charged and one big shot steps down gracefully. Sure, some might argue that these 4 were rogue officers drunk with power, but it was also believed that the upper echelons were of full knowledge of the training going on under their command. Previous batches of this infamous course reported similar treatments from different officers. If such torture sessions were so regular and similar in treatment, where is the root of it? Of course no specific instructions will be written down in some training manual but one can bet that it was either a unique interpretation of vague training instructions or an informal (yet celebrated) culture passed down from batch to batch.<br><br>If either were true and even if the upper echelon didn't know what was happening on the ground, by dint of those two reasons, upper echelon is guilty of dereliction of duty and is therefore guilty and liable and must be held accountable.<br><br>To my mind, if you want to present accountability, make everyone involved accountable. To kill a hydra, cut off its head, so to speak. </blockquote><img src="http://singaporebeauty.com/img/commando.gif"></div>
