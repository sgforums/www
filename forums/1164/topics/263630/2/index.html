I just came back from a two-week ICT, only to find out that I missed out on this drop-dead hilarious thread!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mad.gif" alt="Mad" title="Mad">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br>LN: I can agree that the Aussies don't have a perfect defence force, but it would be a mistake to think that our own SAF is infallible.
