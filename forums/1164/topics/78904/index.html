            <div class='col-md body'>I've always have great respect for the NDU men.  Do not only defend the country, they make a major contribution to society. When there is drowning at sea or in the rivers, its the NDU guys that are there looking for the missing person.  They have to recover the dead bodies that were bloated and would break apart easily if pulled too hard.  You think commandos have to go thru this? The NDU training is not any easier than commandos but its always the commandos that get all the publicity.</div>
