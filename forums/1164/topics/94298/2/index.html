Teo Chee Hean did mention before that the SM1 tank's replacement may not be another tank. So it COULD be that they are looking at wheeled AFV with a main tank gun.

Becos it is a private venture by ST, there were no news blackout at all.<br><br>Anyway, there is some leaked info on the new light tank from Janes' IDR, go to the new forum for more info.<br><br>From the report, I believe that SM1 replacement will certainly be tracked, for whether it will be gun armed, missile armed or hybrid that remain to be seen, but the report seem to pointing toward gun armed.</div>
