            <div class='col-md body'>I am wondering if the Terrex is a suitable replacement for the V-150/200 family, considering that the V-200 has 4 wheels while the Terrex has 8.<br>This would certainly result in a higher maintenance cost.<br>It seems to be pretty long too.

A 12,7 mm. or a 25 mm. turret can be installed and can be remotely controlled by personnel inside the sealed hull.<br>ARISGATOR can safely navigate in open sea even in considerable rough conditions, showing a very low profile above the water and maintaining the same performance on land as the original M113 APC.<br><br>This transformation of M113 APC into ARISGATOR gives the Armed Forces the opportunity to have, at very low cost, a light amphibious vehicle.<br>ARISGATOR can operate in stand-alone missions or in support of larger and more dedicated amphibious vehicles.<br><br>A low rate initial production contract for different configuration of ARISGATOR has been awarded to ARIS by Italian Mod to satisfy Army and Navy Landing Forces requirement.</blockquote><img src="http://www.geocities.com/militaryvehicles/arisgatorwatertn.jpg"><br><img src="http://www.combatreform.com/amphigavinsready.jpg"><br><br>Here the brochure:<br><br><a href="http://www.arisspa.it/inglese/pdf/ARISGINGL.pdf" rel="nofollow">http://www.arisspa.it/inglese/pdf/ARISGINGL.pdf</a><br><br>With more Bionix coming online, I believe 2-3 hundred M113 could be upgraded with the  ARISGATOR oceanic kit and truly boost our RDF's amphibious capability! <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"></div>
