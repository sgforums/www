These techniques will be transferred as part of the technology package to our Malaysian partners.<br><br>"Thus, the most modern naval shipbuilding technologies will soon exist in Malaysia.<br><br>"There are, of course, very key, central equipment technologies that will be common between the T45 and the new RMN frigates. These will be proven and developed on the T45 prior to integration on the RMN vessels," he said.<br><br>"Similarly, this equipment will be supported by Malaysian companies as part of the transfer of technology package."<br><br>Meighan said BAE Systems was confident LSE would be more than able to undertake the frigate programme once certain measures were taken.<br><br>The entire programme is expected to take about five years, but LSE needs to upgrade the infrastructure at its shipyard in Labuan before the programme can get started. The upgrading work is expected to take six months.<br><br>The Dauntless is the second of eight T45 destroyers which will, in concert with the UKÂ’s Future Aircraft Carrier, provide the backbone of the RMNÂ’s air defences for much of the first half of the 21st century.<br><br>The vessels are expected to be in service with the RMN until at least 2040.<br><br><img src="http://www.nst.com.my/Current_News/nst/Thursday/National/20070208082513/destroyer.jpg"><br><br><a href="http://" rel="nofollow"></a></div>

This system operates the ASTER family of surface-to-air missiles. There are two versions of the ASTER, the ASTER-15 and the ASTER-30. The ASTER 15 is a point-defense system, with a range of 30 kilometers. It has been installed on the Formidable-class frigates in the Singaporean Navy and the al-Riyadh class frigates in the Saudi Navy. The other missile in the family is the ASTER 30, with a range of to 70 kilometers. This will be on the destroyers. The ASTER missiles are guided by a variant of the active-radar seeker used on the Mica air-to-air missile<br><br>Are our neighbours going to be using the ASTER as well?</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Depends what the Malaysians are looking for. Are they looking for multi-role frigates or air-defence frigates which the Dauntless class is? I suspect the Malaysians will probably follow what we have and put together a multi-role frigate. Heck, the Type 45s don't even have Harpoons mounted initially, though they could be.<br><br>I was remembering reading that Aster 30 is a provision for our frigates, hence why our Defence Minister talked about anti-ICBM defence or something.</div>

It is not comforting for them to live next to a super aggressive little island that is armed to the teeth and is short of every damn thing like land, water, natural resources etc...
