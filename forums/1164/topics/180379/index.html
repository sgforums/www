            <div class='col-md body'>According to a Flight International article dated February 14th, Singapore is to launch a competition for a new advanced jet trainer (AJT) to replace about 20 TA-4SU trainers based in Cazaux, France.<br><br>The most likely contenders are Aermacchi M346, BAE Systems Hawk 128 and Korea Aerospace Industries (KAI) T-50. Following the AJT, aircraft manufacturers expect another competition will be held to pick F-5 replacements. The article extrapolates that "Singapore is expected to consider the JSF against contenders such as the Saab Gripen" and "If the T-50 wins the AJT competition, KAIÂ’s proposed F-50 may also be considered."<br><br>Whether or not the Republic of Singapore Air Force will ever consider short-legged lightweight fighters such as the Gripen and the proposed F-50 depends on the force structure the RSAF wants to build - a 'strategic' air force with long range fighter bombers, an 'army's flying artillery' dedicated to close air support or an awkward compromise between the two.<br><br>Cheers,<br>Sunho</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>If I'm not wrong, I read that some country picked the Gripen as their F-16 replacement.  Must be quite a good aircraft then.  Anyway, looks-wise I'd definitely say the Gripen.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Sorry got lost for a moment.  Wasn't the JSF supposed to replace the F-16s?<br><br>And to replace the F-5s, I think they might actually purchase more Strike Eagles instead?  Unless there is a specific competition for Singapore's new Light Multi-role fighter.....<br><br>As for the AJT, I think the T-50 makes a good lead in trainer to the F-16 and F-15s,  though I've noticed the cockpit configuration as well as HUD is closer to the F-16...<br><br>Another aircraft that I thought would have a good chance would be the 311.  Its not as powerful as the T-50, and for trainers, thats a good thing.<br><br>Whether its gonna be the 311 or the T-50 would depend on whether RSAF is gonna go back to the reliable amercchi (htf u spell that?)  for the sake of familiarity with their equipment... OR whether we prefer driving koreans stuff like Hyundai or KIA... *Grumble*</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>No doubt our F-16 C/D may not be the latest but if I had to choose between replacing F-5 and F-16, I'd say our F-5 definitely needs to be replaced first.<br><br>The recent F-15 contract was for 12 jets with the option for another 8.  I doubt 20 F-15s are enough to replace all our A4 and F-5.<br><br>IMO, the F-16 is still a lethal jet.  If they need to replace our F-16 C/D, perhaps they can replace it with the Block 60 F-16 E/F.<br><br>As for the F-5 replacement, I'm thinking a non-US jet would be good idea.  I don't like the idea of buying everything from one source country.  Too much dependance there.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Well, it does make sense that we should get an even lower maintenance light fighter to replace our F-5s for peace time ops.<br><br>In fact, I sometimes think we don't even need a light fighter for that.  Make some stealth hot air balloon and mount AMRAAMs on it. All u need is some radar to paint the target. wooo!!<br><br>I don't think we are stopping at 20 MudHens. I suspect maybe about 40+ eventually.  About the F-16E/F, well, I'm not really for the idea.  Our current configuration is already sufficient.  Besides, I heard the first F-16E/F that flew for an airforce...crashed. Must be some kinda jinx to it!<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Believe the country that "replaced" their F16s with the Gripens was in Europe?  Think F16s were leased as an interim solution whilst they were waiting for the Gripens.<br><br>Yes, 20 F15Es does sound a bit little.  We will probably end up with two squardrons.<br><br>However I noticed that everyone keeps talking about the F15E being a straight up replacement for the A4.  It isn't.  Do realize that to some extend, our recent F16 C/D 52+s have also been a replacement for the A4s.  Otherwise how do you think the RSAF would have decommissioned an aircraft prior to the arrival of its replacement?  We would be a few squadrons short!<br><br>And remember, we still have two(?) squadrons of F16s in the US.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>F-15SG is not a direct replacement for the skyhawks. RSAF also bought 20 F-16 Blk52  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"> for direct replacement for a skyhawk squadron if i'm not wrong. Perhaps in the future 5 years after using the F-15SG for sometime, they might consider purchasing more F-15. They are probably using a wait and see attitude because F-15SG although the most advanced variant, might not win battle against other Russian a/c. Must try out then they will know. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br><br>insouciant is right to say that we have 2 squadron of F-16 in the US. Maybe they are for very long-term training.</div>

That would give us about 4 F16 squadrons and 2 F15 squadrons.  For this part of the world, that's a pretty significant force.<br><br>Won't be surprised if we add one more F16 squadron to the mix too.  Especially seeing how RSAF often likes to base one or two squadrons overseas.<br><br>This would probably be the cheapest in terms of logistical and maintainence support.</div>
