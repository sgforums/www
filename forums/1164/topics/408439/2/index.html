              <p>actually where is the tens of thousands of american nuclear missles aiming at? it really doesn't matter, does it? the missles can be at arizona and is aiming at the sky, but when it is launched it can make many turns and hit you. Are you coerced?</p>
              <p>Ever ask the average taiwanese if they are afraid of the missles? they will probably tell you that with so many mainland chinese tourists there in taiwan lao gong è€�å…±would never fire any missiles.</p>
              <p>Did China say enough is enough? hehe, when the announcement was made, I was in gz, around the time of singapore independence, the chinese analyst in å‡¤å‡°å�°said that this was expected after the signing of ECFA. Where you get the idea that the SG Taiwan talk is off?</p>
              <p>Do Singapore use planes and ships and tanks to back up our talk? is that why america is sending their aircraft carrier here, to talk? may be china should send their fleets of submarine to LA and SF, to talk.</p>

              <p>The China missile is strictly targetting Taiwan for 1 purposes of unification by force.</p>
              <p>ICBM in Cold war is a defence policy against 1st strike and ensured that whoever pressed the button first will also not survived to win it. It was to make sure equal losses if used. That is why both the Soviet and Western allies develop protocol to ensure no "miss fire".</p>
              <p>This has nothing to do with China not having "enough" nuclear missile vs the US ?</p>
              <p>And also why would the US be firing Nuclear weapon first to destroy its own factory in China.</p>

              <p>agree, the PLA missiles opposite Taiwan were deployed in the beginning as a military campaign, and certainly china never really need to defend themselves against Taiwan, so it was not a defence policy. What really changes the picture is the improved relationship between China and Taiwan, in trade, culture, tourism.... when negotiation works, no need military force.</p>
              <p>the deployment of the missiles in south china then serves the same purpose as the deployment of aircraft carriers in South China Sea now.</p>
              <p>It will be a good gesture to Taiwan for china to really move the missiles elsewhere, may be to the yellow sea where the US carrier is patrolling.</p>
              <p>Not sure what Xinhua news says, we have to wait for further report on the development from Singapore or Taiwan. Don't think the government from Sg and Tw could make official announcement and then let china put it down, china may pour cold water though.</p>

              <p>China threat or US threat? it is obvious china bashing americans are all over internet</p>
              <p>americans r trying their best to stir up conflicts among asians especially against their competitor, the chinese, only a really really are dumb asian that still can't figure it out</p>
              <p>American's foreign policy is strive to dominate the world for about economic and ideology</p>
              <p>everyone aroudn the world has legitimate concern about US threat, just read their history background, in the last 50 years, USA overthrew 50 foreign leaders,  wage wars agaisnt 30 countries, drop bombs on 30 countries, attempted to assasinate more than 50 foreign leaders, supressed dozens of nationalist and populist movements in every corners of the world</p>

              <p>it is obvious US is planning to stir up conflict and wars among asians to keep their ecomonic domnation, remmeber that biggest US creditors are asian but so do US competitors. The US will try to screw the asian up, probably using north korea.</p>
              <p>since its creation the US is extremely racist against asian (native american), all the way to ww2, vietnam war, korean wars...</p>
