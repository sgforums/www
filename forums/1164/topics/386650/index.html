              <p>It must b said that the incidents are being blown out of proportion by people with malicious intent both local and abroad. It need to b said that a very small and minute percentage of the musllim proportion are involved in both cases, and a few individuals went overboard by letting their pent up emotions take hold, instead of thinking with cool minds and rationale. and to make matters worse, others both local and neighbours, bent on making a mountain out of a molehill, harped on the issue, hoping to make it worse and inviting reciprocal hate responses from individuals that think they should respond accordingly. Thankfully the MAJORITY of malaysians both muslims and non muslims are thinking straight and love peace and harmony above everything else.</p>
              <p>It really warms my heart to see malaysians of all religions and races banding together to do patrols around churces and mosques to prevent hot heads and recalcitrant individuals or groups from harming the places of worship. This is a much better response compared to the silent majority of Germans who keep their peace when the Nazis did the things they did to the jews.</p>
              <p>This thread started when the person who posted the thread accused? Malaysian soldiers of doing the Nazi salute. This is uncalled for and unethical, thus associating our men in uniform with Nazis. I pray that the new technology available to us to disseminate info and news will b used with responsiblity and accountability. I am sure that Singaporeans or for that matter any nationality,would not like it either if their men and women in green, blue or  grey is blanketed with a negative connotations just because of an alleged picture or alleged piece of evidence.</p>

              the MAJORITY of malaysians both muslims and non muslims are
              thinking straight and love peace and harmony above everything
              else.</p>
              <p>It really warms my heart to see malaysians of all religions and
              races banding together to do patrols around churces and mosques to
              prevent hot heads and recalcitrant individuals or groups from
              harming the places of worship. This is a much better response
              compared to the silent majority of Germans who keep their peace
              when the Nazis did the things they did to the jews.</p>
              <p>This thread started when the person who posted the thread
              accused? Malaysian soldiers of doing the Nazi salute. This is
              uncalled for and unethical, thus associating our men in uniform
              with Nazis. I pray that the new technology available to us to
              disseminate info and news will b used with responsiblity and
              accountability. I am sure that Singaporeans or for that matter any
              nationality,would not like it either if their men and women in
              green, blue or  grey is blanketed with a negative connotations
              just because of an alleged picture or alleged piece of
              evidence.</p>
              <p>Thank you for reading this response with an open mind and
              without prejudice.</p>

              <p>it's not one incident, sport, but nine churches and counting .... single ? isolated ? so what's the magic number ? .... </p>
              <p>and of course, you're right .... with modern technology, the whole world is reading about the church firebombings and cows heads being kicked about. <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Cartoon/smile.png" alt="smile.png"> Don't like others to see the pics ? make sure such things don't happen.</p>
              <p>Aganist zionism and not the jews huh ? Pray tell, why are malaysian passports stamped "valid for all countries except israel" ? why is it illegal for any malaysians to have any business dealings with any israeli-owned businesses and companies, why are israeli citizens forbidden to enter malaysia, hell, even the civilian airline is not allowed to pass over malaysian airspace ?!?!</p>
              <p>And surely, you remember the "global jewish conspiracy" quotes of the mamak you guys had in power before pak lah ? during the height of the financial crisis then ?</p>
              <p>so entrenched racism does not exist ? hard to swallow for the only country in the world which has a long term affirmative policy for, ironically, the majority, eh ?</p>
              <p>so ... you think it's offensive to be linked to the nazis .... but what about chaps like the hezbollah then ? ...</p>

              <p>What u suggest is unfair and unjust, plus with mischief intent. The picture is a snap of the soldiers raising their hands all the way to slightly above their heads while voicing  out ' Daulat Tuanku' in homage to our king. (similar 'god save the king' i think).</p>
              <p>it speaks well for the soldiers discipline and timing, that the hands are all caught up in the process of raising to the height i mentioned, almost simultaneously when the picture was taken.</p>

              <p>very interesting.....the soldiers raised their hands exactly the same way as the neo nazi in the other picture, the right hands, and all the way to slightly above their heads.</p>
              <p>I don't know Malay, but is 'Daulat Tuanku' not similar to ' heil fuhrer' , or simply 'sieg heil'.....hahaha...</p>
              <p>I am sure the SS and Wehrmacht were equally disciplined with timely salute.</p>
              <p>Such salute is banned in Germany and Australia after the war. So why is the Malaysian army taking over this salute? since when and why did they abandon the old british salute? is it just coincidental that the hezbollah also salute the same way?</p>
              <p>the mind is opened, without prejudice, and is definitely not dead, hmmm....we are just waiting to see what serious actions the Malaysian government are taking against these 'minority'.</p>

              <p>my dear chap fatum.. from your writings, it seems that u have a chip on your shoulder when it comes to my country. You try to insinuate that our country's armed forces have similarities with the nazis. Then u change tack and highlight the isolated and unfortunate incident of the  cow's head, which the perpetrators are being prosecuted in the courts. Next u implied that there are fire 'bombs' of churches. Please check your facts. There is 1 burning of a church incident, all the others were failures, thank god. I dont condone it and i believe most malaysian dont either. We are sad it happened, but we are trying to stem it as a nation, regardless of race or religion. U asked about the number that is acceptable, my answer is 0.. no place of worship should ever be threatened.</p>
              <p>I tried to explain about the picture of our soldiers that u potrayed.. but its never enough for u. Now u want to drag in about the national policy of my country. That is our soverign right.. as your country's right to decide who your friends are. That is what democracy is all about. I cannot answer your questions, i guess if u really are pissed off with our foreign policy, you should write to our foreign ministry via your foreign ministry. If u still pissed.. then the next best thing is avoid coming to our country.</p>
              <p>If our actions are truely wrong, yes by all means write in your objections. But please avoid insinuating that our armed forces are in the same league as the nazis. by depicting as if we are in cohorts with their action. That is uncalled for and unfair.</p>
              <p>Yes there are screw ups in our armed forces, such as corruption, theft of our jet engines among the latest embaressment... i dont object when u or even our countrymen makes fun of it, because it really happened. It helps keep the relevant authorities in check. BUT i draw the line when u or others like u, fabricate stories to promote your own opinioted agenda by saying our soldiers perform the nazi salute!</p>
              <p>my dear fatum, a glass is half full or half empty. I hope u have chosen the correct perception. The world is in enough trouble as it is, without dumping it with hate, negative perceptions and a hate thy neighbour attitude.</p>

              <p>dear mr/ms diehard, the wermacht and the ss saluted each other with the nazi salute. Our soldiers only pronouced " Daulat Tuanku-Long live the King'' in his presence and on his birthday. Even during the trooping of the colours our soldiers just gave his majesty the normal salute.</p>
              <p>Ok  guys/gals.. i have said my piece in a civilised manner as i possibly can. Hopefully u r satisfied, but if not, well your opinion, you are entitled to it.</p>

              <p>firstly, a molotov cocktail is known as a firebomb, sport. And, there were nine church attacks, just because only one got burned down doesn't make the other eight any less real.</p>
              <p>secondly, do you imagine opinions in people's minds are formed overnight ? No one would ever mistake, say for example, a saffron robes wearing buddhist monk, for a nazi if he sports a swastika, even if I insinuate that this is so, but why is this not true for others ?</p>
              <p>obviously, the association, while hurtful, is plausible enough for people like you, to bust a gut.</p>
              <p>Why is this association so plausible ? </p>
              <p>part of the answer lies on the very first post yours here, a slip of the tongue can be so illuminating, isn't it ? And of course, the answer lies beyond one old fart leaders ranting about jewish economic conspiracies of course. You'd just have to look what other people have been doing, remember hishamuddin and his kris waving ? khairy and his racist rants ? these people are mainstream characters mind you, members of the establishment, not some ignorant peasant folks kicking around a cow's head just to piss off some hindu neighbours, if someone's seen such bits of news, isn't it easy for them to believe in nazi salutes ? </p>
              <p>and of course, you certainly have fans of hitler over there too.</p>
              <p>this one, is from a character called <strong>mahaguru58,</strong> the chap behind this group called the muslims bloggers' alliance. He was granted an interview recently, and this is what he said.</p>
              <p>"<span style="font-style: italic; color: #ff0000;">"Those who
              feel very strongly about it, this is going to offend some people I
              don't give a damn, they should have it tattooed on their chest like
              what Adolf Hitler did, you know, this is a Jew right?, and they had
              tattoos. So those who are now so adamant on not wanting to be buried as
              a Muslim, or whatever, for whatever reason, they should have it
              tattooed on their chest."</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-style: italic; color: #ff0000;">"I think they should tattoo it on their chest or forehead <span style="font-weight: bold;">'I am a kafir'.</span>"</span></p>
              <p>copy that passage into google and do a search ... there are about 3000 video and text links.</p>
              <p>So, my dear chap, you understand why it's so easy for me to think that the MAF was performing a nazi salute now ?</p>
              <p>Remember this, even if you can stop people from saying the things you don't like to hear, you won't be able to stop people from thinking things you don't like them to think. The world is watching you guys now too ....</p>
