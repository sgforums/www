            <div class='col-md body'>Haha. After reading your reply, it would seem that the gist of your comment is that you were irked that i quoted you and hate what you are reading. Much less than what you are saying, this is in fact a discussion in a forum. Feel free to refute them even if the poster feels strongly about them.<br><br><blockquote>As discussed by who? The Chief of Defence? Does SAF know what you consider thinkable or unthinkable..? </blockquote>Go read the thread. It  is made within the context of the SAF targetting key structures and equipment. Are you telling me that it would not be unthinkable for us not to have targetted them in our initial strikes. Perhaps, you have a better idea. Then, let`s hear them.<br><br><blockquote>You have this on what authority? We know a lot, true. But only you believe we know absolutely everything</blockquote>What are you rambling about?<br><br>Did i say that? I say that it `would' be very hard for the Malaysians to move thier forces around. Conceivably, our current surveillance assets and the fact that we are very close would make it very hard for them to move around. That is factually correct. Especially equipments large equipments like tanks, armoured vehicles, etc.<br><br><blockquote>Absolutely none? Wah... very impressive theory.<br><br>How do you know all these things? Especially when they have not even happened yet.<br><br>Everyone is talking about possible scenarios but you are talking absolutes.<br></blockquote>And how do you know they would not be? Given our ability to see first and strike first. And where on earth is the `absoluteness' part of my post. Either you are hallucinating or you simply do not like hearing possibilities of that nature and based on our current capabilities.<br><br><blockquote>You mean absolutely not one single rocket will get through? Wow... so powderful one... </blockquote>Having trouble reading are we? Where did i say that? But it may well be the case since cheap unguided rockets are are relatively easier to shoot with sophisticated SAM systems <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Nothing is garanteed at all. If there is, we will just all convert to artillery since we know where all their troops are and dont need to bother fighting them since we can just put a 155mm or a 250pound jdam where they stand.<br><br>Saying this as someone in my POV, is that while we have enhance battlefield sensors, the conflict will have to be fought on the ground. It's real and information is still lacking. Just because you know the guy is standing in that place doesnt mean you wont die trying to reach him.<br><br>There's no such thing as garanteed destruction from pretargetted/firststrike plans. By that same measure, Taiwan should just give up since everything they own is already targetted <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz"> Not to draw that into conflict but stated as a clear example.<br><br>Perhaps, Astros2 may be fitted with a crude tradjectory correction device?  It might not even have to be announce since it's not an arms purchase. Always remember, if you have a sniper rifle, to kill a person you have to aim..if you have a suicide bomber strapped on nails+ballbearings+TNT, no aiming is required.<br><br>War is dirty, the person who can walk away from the Geneva Convention in a war is the one who won the war (Can clean up all evidence mah).</div>

Maybe these light and fast troops will come in for the sweep up after the initial heavy armoured strike force which consist of the Leo2 MBTs and the BX2.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"></div>

Either way, it depends on how we armour the Terrex. Trouble with the Stryker was weight requirements and how they really did their best to squeeze it on board a C-130. Then on the ground, they had to refit it with a host of passive defences to guard against RPG rounds etc. No doubt the Terrex has to receive the same treatment. So it boils down to how the Terrex takes the added load.</div>
