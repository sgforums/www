            <div class='col-md body'>Just for the record, S'pore has never EVER used the word war.  M'sia however has one several occasions although they did try to cover it up.<br><br>Classical e.g. was when that idiot Syed Hamid Albar said that S'pore has two choices get water or go to war, only to later ask reporters when he ever said the war word.<br><br>Having MLRS which are unguided to me, says a lot about how much they care or rather DO NOT care about collateral damage.  Some might argue its there to be a deterrent.  I say bullocks!  If war does break out, don't expect me to believe they wouldn't use it!<br><br>Even the US does not use its MLRS in crowded areas.  If memory serves corectly, it was last used in the vast desserts of Iraq.  Certainly not in an Iraqi neighbourhood.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>When Malaysia goes to court to sue for peace, she would do so under the Geneva conventions. A series of negotiations would ensue. What leverage would she have if she is found guilty of targetting civilians wantonly? The MAF is not so unintelligent. I do not doubt that the MAF would seek to disable Singapore`s key structures but she would use precision strike weapons just as we would. If they do not have it now, they would undeniably buy them in the future. Not the unreliable Astross. The Astross would be shooting at our troops in Malaysia if they manage to escape the initial round of strikes from the SAF that is.<br><br>At any rate, the SAF would be striking first. And believe you in me that the Astross and other key equipment and structures would be targetted first. But honestly, we seek to disable and are more than capable of annihiliating thier command and control structures and key equipment. Hence, it would be unlikely that the Astross would be used against mainland Singapore.<br><br>This third reason makes it almost impossible for them to use the Astross against Singapore. How are they going to shoot at our bases when we have foriegn forces(read US) stationed there? They would not even dare.<br><br>Oh by the way, rockets do not bring down buildings. But they sure will make anyone furious.<br><br>The pyschological element of a rocket attack is no different than an artillery strike or a bomb attack. You cannot even differentiate between these strikes because you cannot see them coming. But you can certainly enjoy the new decor and smoke plume. So, these are things which people would get used to as the war progress. Not that they have a choice.</div>
