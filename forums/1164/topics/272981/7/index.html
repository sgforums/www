Ability to track multiple armour or other vehicles and strike with deadly precision from very far. Needs 'eyes' out in the battlefield to track targets, not GPS.

It said the total value could be $330 million if all options were exercised.<br><br>HIMARS supplements traditional canon artillery by delivering high-volume firepower in a short time against time-sensitive targets, the notice to Congress said.<br><br>"The proposed sale will contribute to the foreign policy and national security of the United States by helping to improve the security of a friendly country that has been, and continues to be, an important force for economic progress in Southeast Asia," the notice said.<br><br>On Aug. 24, the agency told Congress that Singapore was also seeking up to 84 precision-guided bombs for its F-15 fighter jet fleet as part of a military package valued at up to $200 million.<br><br>The notice of a potential sale is required by U.S. law. It does not mean a sale has been concluded. Congress retains the power to block a sale but rarely does so<br></div>
