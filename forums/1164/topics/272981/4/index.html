            <div class='col-md body'>They are unguided so they are not accurate. And they get more inaccurate the further they are from thier target. Look for Gary`s post. He has done quite a bit of reading about it.<br><br>You are right.lol. Your scenarios are rather far-fetched. More like a doomsday one for both sides. Lol. But seriously, I do not think there is a risk of a meltdown ala a nuclear plant melt-down in the laboratory they have up north because the tests are simply not of that nature. Think of a school lab where they make rudimentary research to know more about nuclear science. There was a post about it recently by Lion-noisy. Hence, it is likely that Singapore would have it as well. Or collaborate with the Mexicans as you say.<br><br>I agree that training Singaporeans to protect ourselves against such attacks would be useful. But the government has not done so in a large scale and that is probably due to the absence of such threats in the context you have described. I agree that they are more for terrorism currently.<br><br>ASEAN is a nuclear weapon free zone as all participating nations have agreed to implement Zopfan(Zone of Peace, Freedom, and Neutrality) and SEANWFZ(Southeast Asia Nuclear Weapon Free Zone ); in principle or otherwise. But of course, it does not mean that fickle governments might not change thier minds to thier own disrepute and well-being. Just goes to show how ineffective ASEAN is. lol. Just look at who are the ones making noises now and see if they are the same proponents of the latter two agreements not too long ago. We should never trust thier word.<br><br>Conceivably, the world would not tolerate another nuclear power(nuclear weapons) or simply one which possesses weapons of mass destruction. And none of these countries possess the capability to develop nuclear plants currently or in the future in spite of suggestions by politicians who know next to nothing about this technology. It takes a lot of time.</div>

So gary when you calculate the CEP did you take the mass and weight of the rocket too? You see a 127mm rocket and 300mm rocket act differently....<br><br>a small rocket like the ss30 (if the calculation are right) would limit its effective range to 30-40 km max. But a 300mm rocket the ss80 which have bigger mass nad weight will have a farther effective range..in this case its max efective range is 90 km (max).<br><br>so the argument on the accuracy of the unguided rocket have been solved by the designer ..otherwise astros 2 is a useless weapon.<br><br>any way see ya...</div></blockquote>I did not calculate the CEP of the Astros II, but it is well known fact that unguided rocket technology is at best 1% of range, for example the best unguided rocket system of the Russian origin was the Uragan of the 70s has a CEP of 1%.<br><br>So it does not matter whether it is  127mm rocket or 300mm rocket , the technology remain the same!!!<br><br>Let me quote what I have posted elsewhere:<br><br><blockquote>Tube gun like 155mm howitzer has a CEP abt 0.2~0.3% of range.<br><br>Older technology unguided rocket like the Uragan,Astro etc have a CEP of at least 1% of range.<br><br>The newer technoloy using what they called controlled or trajectory correction rocket able improve the CEP to abt 0.4~0.5%, eg. the Smerch, LAR-160.<br><br>Therefore, you see unguided rocket produced by US and Russia in the 60~70s are of range below 40km becos any higher range is tactically useless becos of inaccuracy of an unguided rocket.<br><br>With introduction of trajectory correction technology in the ealiar 80s by the Russian where you see rocket range go up 80~90km.<br><br>And US introduced the GPS guided ATACMs has range go beyond that becos of CEP are within metres.<br></blockquote>The world first trajectory correction rocket system was the Smerch which was developed after Astros II's SS-30 to SS-60, so they all unguided rockets, SS-80 were developed later by using a new improved rocket motor to extend the range of SS-60, which is the SS-80.<br><br>So SS-80 is also unguided rocket, which means from SS-30 to SS-80 are all unguided rocket, which also means all have poor CEP of at least 1% of range!!!<br><br>Proofs for all the above could be found in the link I have provided.<br><br>So do you  understand all the above?</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>This is not WW2. Now, I am no expert on this mattter but I know that aircraft runaways can be repaired extremely fast in this age. We are not talking days, weeks and months. They can be repaired as fast as 30 mins or less. Obviously, we have that capability since air-craft runaways are being repaired on a daily basis at commercial air-ports all around the world using rapid repair kits; polymers, fast drying concrete, etc. Spalls on runaways can happen anytime due to a variety of factors.

If the MLRS strike was timed way after midnight, where civilian population would be minimal in the CBD areas, the citizens may start considering the cost to the war in the first place.<br><br>Whether, the war may have been a "Pre-emptive" strike, or an effort to secure our water supply (which we are moving away from), the people might consider the SAF efforts to have brought upon us a disaster rather than become angered at the MAF.<br><br>It is part and parcel of war to be able to threaten strategic objectives and if necessary demonstrate the intent and capability to capture or damage it.  Such strategic objectives could be industrial centers, or financial centers.  (Side note: I do not consider densely populated civilian housing to be strategic objectives. )<br><br>While they have too few of such MRLS to level the CBD (perhaps we'd lose a few storeys off a few buildings), it does send the message across that they are capable of threatening it, and would "encourage" to weigh our "costs" before we dare make any military ventures into M'sia.<br><br>An honest question, besides their Astross 2, are we concerned/worried about the MAF capability as a whole, or any of their other systems?  I'm not even concerned about their Flanker/Adder capability. Its gonna cost them more money to maintain than to fly.<br><br>OTOH, a saturated rocket attack on the CBD does bring the "Risks" of war a lil closer to home.</div>
