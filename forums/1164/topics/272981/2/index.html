If the system were in the hand of a nation that dont give a damn about collateral will definately use this system.<br><br>While i think you are right about the the accuracy of one rocket...please bare in mind that the astros can ripple fire a salvo 4 rounds of SS-60/SS-80 rocket, caliber 300mm (which can cater for a bigger cluster munitions warhead) and has a range between 20km and 80km.<br><br>Since the the command and control vehicle/fire-control system (AV-VCC) can coordinate 3 batteries of Astros2 (six AV-LMU Universal Multiple Launchers per batteries) to saturate (i emphasized this again) an area of 1 square kilometers.

They are unguided rockets. And Himars and other newer western systems will carry guided rockets.  The reason why the MAF got the Astross is to reduce the huge gap or lead Singapore has in terms of artillery systems. Singapore`s aritllery arsenal is just massive. Just read your own article you posted silly. It is pointless to compare Singapore and Malaysia. Priorities differ and honestly, Singapore is in a different league completely.<br><br>I agree with many of the astute comments made by many posters here. We do not need another run of the mill artillery delivery system. The Himars, etc if acquired will be carrying precision guided rockets or missiles; and most likely from Israel.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Malaysia would use her Astross as normal artillery systems given the relative lack in artillery systems. Singapore does not have this problem at all since we have a huge arsenal of artillery systems which can do that job. Add that to our huge air-force which can bomb with impunity.<br><br>The problem with unguided rockets is that the latter`s accuracy gets more inaccurate the further they go. If you want to destroy strategic targets and hardened targets, you would go for a unitary war-head and not cluster munitions. But that does not mean the GMLRs cannot be configured to carry cluster munitions.  Which would want? A rocket which would go off- tangent and hit something esle or an accurate one?<br><br>Good luck to them killing of thier own people and destroying thier own buildings if they are not worried about collateral damage.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote>How about investment in equipment to intercept such weapons?</blockquote>In some ways, our surface-to-air capability is already being beefed up with the upgraded I-hawks being able to engage multiple targets 40 km away, newer multi-function radars, etc. Our screen is pretty tight as it is. Add that to revealed plans for new systems which will be acquired very soon and it will get even better.<br></div>

And why they will be used as normal artillery systems. How would it look without the Astross?

Aim at civilians. Fantastic way of throwing yourselves before the UN. Fortunately, the MAF are intelligent. In the first place, it is unlikely you will get any shot fired with the SAF`s pre-emptive strike doctrine.</div>

A quickly done `pretext'. Not that you are a good liar.<br><br>Your `drama' here would not save you from the fact that you are shamlessly trolling under the guise of a Singaporean. Awwww...It is just wrong for you and your family?  These are expressed opinions in a forum. Dont like it. Be somewhere else. And you are in no position to tell Singaporeans here what to write in a place called `Sgforums.' Wanna boast about your sub-par military? Try your own forum. Thank You Very much.<br><br>Every now and then, someone likes you come along but almost always fall flat on your face. Just look at the visual garbage you have just posted.</div>
