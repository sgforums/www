            <div class='col-md body'>Singapore plans multiple rocket launcher, IFV acquisitions<br>Robert Karniol JDW Asia-Pacific Bureau Chief<br>Bangkok<br><br>Key Points<br>Singapore is seeking to acquire its first multiple rocket system and first wheeled IFV<br><br>The Singapore Army is enhancing its firepower and mobility capabilities with the planned acquisition of its first multiple rocket launcher (MRL) and its first wheeled infantry fighting vehicle (IFV).<br><br>The MRL requirement is for 18 systems, with the request for proposals currently in progress. First deliveries are expected in about 18 months.<br><br>Contenders for the contract remain unclear, but sources told Jane's that talks on the programme are under way with the US. This suggests that potential candidates include the 227 mm Multiple Launch Rocket System and the High-Mobility Artillery Rocket System, both from Lockheed Martin Missiles and Fire Control.<br><br>The IFV programme is aimed to equip three battalions, with initial deliveries expected around the end of 2008. The locally developed Singapore Technologies (ST) Kinetics 8 x 8 Terrex AV81 IFV is among several platforms under consideration; other options remain unknown.<br><br>The army most recently upgraded its artillery with the introduction of ST Kinetics' Pegasus 155 mm/39 calibre Singapore Lightweight Howitzer, unveiled in late 2005. This supplemented the ST Kinetics Primus 155 mm/39 calibre self-propelled artillery system that was revealed two years earlier.<br><br>The wheeled IFV would complement two tracked platforms in current service: the ST Kinetics Bionix IFV, operationally deployed since 1999; and the older Giat Industries AMX-10P infantry combat vehicle.<br><br>The Singapore Army will further bolster its capabilities with deliveries, due to start in mid-2008, of 66 ex-German Armed Forces Krauss-Maffei Wegmann Leopard 2A4 main battle tanks, together with an additional 30 platforms earmarked as spares. These are intended to replace AMX-13 light tanks.<br><br>The planned acquisitions are linked to a broader force modernisation programme currently in progress and dubbed the third-generation Singapore Armed Forces.<br></div>

( i.e. GPS guided, single warhead)</blockquote><a href="http://www.designation-systems.net/dusrm/app4/mlrs.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.designation-systems.net/dusrm/app4/mlrs.html</a><br><br>Here another quote:<br><br><blockquote>The US Army is currently working on developing and fielding unitary (one large warhead instead of submunitions) rocket and ATACMS variants, as well as a guided rocket.<br><br>MLRS has recently been upgraded with guided rounds. Phase I testing of a guided unitary round (XM31) was completed on an accelerated schedule in March 2006. Due to an Urgent Need Statement the guided unitary round has already been fielded and used in action in Iraq.[1] Lockheed Martin also received a contract to convert existing M30 DPICM GMLRS rockets to the XM31 unitary variant<br></blockquote><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/M270_Multiple_Launch_Rocket_System" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/M270_Multiple_Launch_Rocket_System</a><br><br>So from the above, US is not going for any unguided rocket like the M26  but all single warhead GPS guided GMLRS and ATACMS, I believe SAF is going toward the same direction.</div>

The Gemas-based 51st Battalion of the RAD, known as 51 RAD (and attached to the Malacca-based 3 Division), is currently equipped with 18 Â‘KerisÂ’ Astros 2 MLRS launchers that were ordered in November 2000 and delivered 20 months later. The contract, worth RM791.92 million, included the supply of 1,000 SS-30 30km-range rockets, 224 SS-60 60km-range rockets, 576 SS-80 80km-range rockets along with SS-09 training rockets. The to-be-inked contract for equipping the new BattalionÂ—52 RADÂ—is valued at RM950 million. The Astros 2 MLRS includes a fleet of vehicles comprising the Universal Multiple Launcher (AV-LMU) capable of firing five kinds of rockets with different calibers and diameters; Ammunition Supply Vehicle (AV-RMD) for resupplying the AV-LMU and carrying two complete loads for each launcher; Avibras AV-VBL (Viaturas Blindadas Leves) 4 x 4 light armoured vehicles using the command and control vehicle/fire-control system (AV-VCC) to provide the Battalion-level command with coordination and direction of firing missions for up to 3 Astros 2 Batteries; Mobile Workshops for electronic and mechanic field maintenance of the system; and an Electronic Fire-Control Unit (AV-UCF) for facilitating the procedures of fire direction using a tracking radar and ballistics computer. A typical Astros 2 Battery configuration comprises six AV-LMU Universal Multiple Launchers, six AV-RMD Ammunition Supply Vehicles together with an AV-UCF Fire Control Unit. The AV-VCC Command and Control Vehicle/Fire-Control Unit together with two mobile workshop vehicles are stationed at the Battalion headquarters. The 127mm SS-30 rocket can be loaded with 32 rounds per launcher and has a range between 9km and 30km. The 300mm SS-60 and SS-80 rockets can be loaded with four rounds per launcher, and has a range between 20km and 80km.<br><br>The Malaysian Army currently has 16 artillery Regiments (medium field artillery and air defence), each with three Batteries. While 10 Regiments are equipped with 105mm pack howitzers, two RegimentsÂ—Gemas-based 21 and 22 RADÂ—are equipped with 28 DENEL/LIW-built 155mm/45-calibre G-5 Mk2000 towed howitzers and 12 BAE Systems-built FH-70 155mm 39-calibre towed howitzers. Future plans call for re-equipping two existing artillery Regiments with truck-mounted, lightweight, motorised 155mm/52-calibre howitzers. Systems already believed top have been offered include BAE Systems/SWS DefenceÂ’s FH-77BWL52 Archer...</blockquote></div>
