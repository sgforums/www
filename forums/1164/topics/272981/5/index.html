But given the circumstances of such a war, air and quite possibly sea civilian traffic would come to a standstill in the peninsula and Singapore.  Risks which we will have to bear. We are not accumulating so much wealth for nothing.</div>

The AV-VCC Command and Control Vehicle/Fire-Control Unit together with two mobile workshop vehicles are stationed at the Battalion headquarters. The 127mm SS-30 rocket can be loaded with 32 rounds per launcher and has a range between 9km and 30km. The 300mm SS-60 and SS-80 rockets can be loaded with four rounds per launcher, and has a range between 20km and 80km.<br><br>The Malaysian Army currently has 16 artillery Regiments (medium field artillery and air defence), each with three Batteries. While 10 Regiments are equipped with 105mm pack howitzers, two RegimentsÂ—Gemas-based 21 and 22 RADÂ—are equipped with 28 DENEL/LIW-built 155mm/45-calibre G-5 Mk2000 towed howitzers and 12 BAE Systems-built FH-70 155mm 39-calibre towed howitzers. Future plans call for re-equipping two existing artillery Regiments with truck-mounted, lightweight, motorised 155mm/52-calibre howitzers.

Anything more.. we will have to silence you.  The only type of arty attached to Infantry and armour units (organic) are 120mm mortar.  Which in my view arent really really "arty"  Not that mortar is not dangerous with they 130 metres wounding radius from ball bearings but that's still rather local support.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Mortar's unique weapon. From what i remember<br><br>Mortar use shorter range, higher arc artillery.  It's rather quiet vs Howitzers...more like a puff vs a kaboom.<br><br>If i remember correct, Mortar Bomb is a shell. It consists of Explosive + ball bearings. A direct hit from a mortar on a lightly armoured vehicle will result in a kill... It has a high amount of explosive ..like a bomb drop by aeroplanes. It has sharpnel as it's encased in a shell. I remember watching an old video how they test mortar effectiveness.  They hang clear plastic bags filled with red water on scarecrows and plant them randomly in a wide field.  Bags up to 130/150 metres away have be puncture...it's more likely a result of ball bearings as the holes i remember were round...The kill radius of a mortar (120mm) is at least 20 metres vs 5m for handgrenades and 10m for 40mm grenades.<br><br>What i remember clearly is, if the mortar is flying...hide....else most likely you dont need to breath through your nostrils...</div>

Wars take time to develop with clear discernible signs.<br><br>To the contrary, Singapore`s huge intelligence gathering capability(air, satellites, singnit, etc) would make it very hard for the Malaysians to move anything around without being seen. Suffice it to say, Singapore has a real-time picture on the ground. Conversely, Malaysia does not have this capability. How many Astross launchers would survive our initial lightning strike? Most likely none.  Assuming a few(what the heck..assume all) are not destroyed and launched some quick salvos before being immediately targetted and bombed/destroyed themselves but at what cost? That would not stop Singapore from crossing the Tebrau and invading Malaysia. But that would just enrage our citizen army even more. Just look at how much hardened the Israelis have become. People will adapt in order to survive.<br><br><blockquote><br>What we need is a anti-rocket defence system like the Patriot.</blockquote>Concievably, these unguided rockets would be easy to shoot down even with our current SAM assets. At issue is whether we want to waste expensive missiles on such cheap rockets.

They do damage them. Their war-heads are small; in many cases smaller than tube artillery shells.<br><br>A major point to note is that Singapore will attack first and yet she retains the ability to hit back harder in the unlikely event when struck first.</div>

With guided rockets, they can be very strategic in nature with long-lasting effects against key targets.<br><br>Remember our tube artillery. It would be unlikely for the Malaysians to array thier artillery pieces(especially the Astross) when they are within range of our own artillery(40km) and especially since our artillery out-number thier artillery greatly.<br><br>The Himars would be able to accomodate a variety of rockets with ranges from 30km to 300 km. Like all MLRS systems, range matters and the further they are, the less rockets(and often smaller war-heads) they can fire. And in the case of the 150 km Israeli guided rockets like the Lorad and 300 km guided ATACMS, the Astross would have to be stationed deeper in Malaysian territory rendering these equipment practically useless where bombing mainland Singapore is concerned and even our forces in Johor.<br><br>Would the Malaysians risk putting thier most prized assets within range of our superior and arguably more accurate rockets then? I think not. Hence, I reckon that we intend to effectively push our virtual safety zone of influence deeper into Malaysia. Not that we cannot absorb any artillery strike. In addition, we are even upgrading our current SAM systems and related defence equipment.<br><br>Would not this bring back both nations to the status quo before the advent of the MLRS? I certainly think so.<br><br>Of course, other systems like our SAMs would play a part as well. And of course, this is not counting our other strategic assets which we have always been rumored to have; being in the form of long range cruise missiles indigenously developed or together with Israel. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"> Perchance, we could see some of them being officially declared in the near future.<br><br>Comments?
