Lets see it in our context.<br><br>What are the Isrealis afraid off? That the Arabs wipe them from the face of the earth .. that is in their blood.<br><br>Are the Malaysians out for blood? Nope .. they want to CONQUER us .. not DESTROY us. Like I said earlier .. the Isrealis are not the best Ideological teachers for us .. their context is very different from our situation. Malaysia will love to have us as part of their nation. They want our infrastructure, our national reserves. Not as a burnt out wasteland.<br><br>And right now, their economy is doing better than ours. So MAD can stand for the destruction of their economy, and their lifestyle, and all that they worked for in the last 40 years.<br><br>That is enough as a deterrence to keep them at bay. At best, the chinese there will also not agree to lose all that they worked hard for. The scenario is find out what they want and deny them.<br><br>Its easier to destroy them militarily and economically than wiping 25 million people out of the face of the earth. we have enough weapons to do that.

The generals listen to the CiC .. who is the head of the government .. who can be removed from office by losing the election.<br><br>In Singapore, you disobey an order .. you are finished.

            <div class='col-md body'>Dkhoo,<br><br><strong>I do not think you understand the concept of MAD. It only applies if in a conflict both sides are 100% assured of destroying each other.</strong><br><br>I think we can find a way to be 100% assured of destroying each other economically. Read my answer to one of the other forum members ..<br><br><strong>We do not have a 100% chance of completely destroying Malaysia. We have a 0% chance of doing that. I think you overestimate our capabilities. We cannot have a strategy that relies on MAD.</strong><br><br>Threatening Singapore or Malaysia to turn the country into Somalia will be sufficient to make both sides see the light. Countries with too much to lose will not want to risk it all.<br><br>If Singapore was next to Mongolia then maybe the Mongols will not be afraid to be knocked back to stone age.<br><br>But Malaysia wants to be developed. They want economic prosperity. The people there want a nice life. They can have the 5Cs without too much difficulty. They are living in a underpopulated, resource rich, technologically advanced, trading nation. MAD on their economy and to turn that country into Somalia will be too much to lose.<br><br><strong> Why would an aggressor nation be deterred by the threat of injury if he could inflict death upon us in return? </strong><br><br>Thats assuming that the aggressor is them. Suppose that for next 20 years, we do this to them, they catch up and they do it to us. How will we like it? Do onto others what you want others to do onto you.<br><br><strong>No, we must seek victory in war if we wish to deter the enemy. An aggressor must realize that he is likely to LOSE a war with us. That is the surest and most effective form of deterrence. The only war for us to defeat the enemy, and therefore deter him and prevent war is a forward defence doctrine. It is the most humane thing to do. If the temptation of war is removed from potential aggressors, then everyone will live in peace. </strong><br><br>Thats your opinion .. I prefer my samurai scenario. Remember this. Invasion of Malaysia for whatever "forward defence" reason is considered an act of war by the international community.<br><br><strong>Firstly, our neighbors should and do realize that because of the conscript nature of our army, we can never be a force of aggression. We cannot annex another country. We cannot permanently capture and hold ground. We are not trained for counterinsurgency. Our neighbors only sometimes pretend to forget this for domestic political reasons. Regardless of how strong the SAF becomes, she can only be a defensive force. We cannot and therefore will not invade. </strong><br><br>Wrong .. see my answer in an earlier thread .. our government has no checks and balances .. too risky to allow our government to have such power ..<br><br><strong>Secondly, the SAF specifically lacks deep strategic strike capability. We do not threaten our neighbors with ballistic or cruise missiles. We have no strategic heavy bombers. We lack sea control platforms like cruisers and aircraft carriers. This means that the SAF is not a force of intimidation. We cannot use the SAF as a stick to make our neighbors do what we want. </strong><br><br>We may not have all those, but our neighbours are even more poorly equipted .. compared to what they have ours is definately better. We have been spending 5-6% of our GDP on weapons .. for 30 years .. and our GDP is higher than all other ASEAN nations .. go figure if our neighbours feel that our weapons are purely for defensive use only.<br><br><strong>Thirdly, our neighbors are not extending the same courtesy to us that you suggest we extend to them. They threaten us with force or deprivation of water.</strong><br><br>Its their water.<br><br><strong> They parade their military hardware.</strong><br><br>Have you never attended a NDP?<br><br><strong>They try to make us feel insecure. We do none of these things, even to the point of keeping our military strength out of the public eye. Saying that we intimidate our neighbors is the pot calling the kettle black. </strong><br><br>Sorry, ah .. I don't share your feelings. In fact, I think 99% of Malaysians are not interested in war or military. During the Malaysia NDP last year, they rolled out their machineray .. my cousin took photos and asked me what the heck are these machines. We know what they are .. they don't. There are less warlike than you portray them to be.<br><br><strong>In summary, I do not feel that a forward defence doctrine is at all undiplomatic or unjustified. They have nothing to fear from us and they know it. On the other hand, we have an entire nation to lose. I do not think that the residents of JB should be at all offended or afraid at our military preparations. I would not be in their position. Of course, their warmongering press ensures that the reality is quite different, but that is not our fault. </strong><br><br>Of course, you and I can agree to disagree on this .. its just an opinion.<br><br><strong>Incidentally, a forward defence doctrine is not just the Mersing Line. It is the idea that we will prevent the enemy from reaching Singapore. If we are attacked from the south we will strike them at sea before they reach our shores, possibly capturing some islands to deny them to the enemy and to base our forces. Of course, due to our air and naval capabilities, an attack from the sea would be extremely difficult and unlikely, so we tend to concentrate discussion on the more interesting question of attack from the land.<br></strong><br><br>If you want to discuss doctrine, lets see which other nation in this world actually practiced this doctrine and kept the peace for how long.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I think you are the joker. You seem to have suffered from some  form of amnesia. May I remind you of the high losses suffered by the original batch of 40 A-4s purchased by S'pore. These include (recalling from my memory) a 4 ship formation lost when it crashed into a Phillipine mountain at while using the practice range at Clark Air base. Loss of 5 pilots as one of them was a TA-4s. One A-4 crashed into chicken coop in Punggol, one crashed into Farmer's house, one crashed into the sea after gunnery practice, etc.  Losses were so heavy they had to buy a second batch of 70 airframes, followed by 16 more. Today, total A-4 strenght is only around 40. U do the math. In addition, Hunter losses were pretty bad too, including from my recollection the loss of 2 in a mid-air collision over the Straits of malacca. Also, BAE Strikemasters were lost, as I recall seeing the wreck of one in a hangar in Tengah years ago. Look at our own accident rates first before looking at others.  By the way the A-4 flown by the RMAF were refurbished by Gruman in the US. I doubt at that time whether they were that familiar with this type of Douglas aircraft. Is your AF buddy a fighter pilot?<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by Gun:</div><div class="quote_body"><span style="color: red;">Last time I heard my AF neighbour buddy saying that  there isn't much to talk about RMAF and its threat.

One aircraft has been lost to date.

            <div class='col-md body'>The fact is that it is extremely difficult to repatriate the F-16s from the US and the A-4s from France after the fighting has started. If S'pore started the conflict by a pre-emptive strike up to the Mersing line, we will be labeled aggressors in the world forum. For France and the US to permit our planes to leave their territory fully fueled and armed immediately, is asking too much. Pressure from  the Muslim world will be made to bear on the US and France to hold the planes there. Even if they do take off, which country will give them permission to land and refuel? U can divert a KC-135 to escort them back, but even that may not be enough without any stops, and it will disrupt the tempo of your air ops to divert the KC 135 to Europe and North America. On paper, we have the bigger air force. The reality is that we have to start with what we have and finish with what we have, and not count on the overseas aircraft. In that sense, we do not have that great a numerical advantage.<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by |-|05|:</div><div class="quote_body">You seemed to have ruled out the fact that we have more planes and that some of our F-16's are stationed overseas.Also fighter planes can take off in 800m of runway....i'm sure we have many islands that can handle that.Also what makes you think we do not have the Aim-120's and SAM's and AA that the Malaysians in your situation have used to such deverstating effect?<br>Oh and no i'm not belittlering the Malaysian armed forces in fact i give them alot of credit and would pay attention and not write them off.However i will not write off our armed forces either</div></blockquote></div>

If you are man enough post this, other wise, I couldn't care less. Really the standard of this forum shows by their poor choice of moderators, and than by the fact that u are running around, afraid the PAP will shut u down for allowing the wrong post.

            <div class='col-md body'>Kenhor,<br><br>If you think that Malaysia or Indonesia will be financially ruined by an invasion of Singapore you are sadly mistaken. The difference between them and us is that they can annex us while we cannot annex them. They can seize our assets and our population and take control of our industry and infrastructure. If they attack us and succeed it will hurt them for a decade or so, but in the end it will benefit them greatly. There is no MAD here. In the overall strategic picture, we are like any other small country in the world.<br><br>You seem incapable of understanding this point. Singapore simply does not have the capability to capture another country's territory since our soldiers are mostly conscripts with civilian lives. What happens after the "war" is just as important. Who would keep the newly captured territory pacified? How could we fight the insurgents that would surely appear? Conversely, the Malaysians or Indonesians can mobilize enough troops from their larger populations to pacify the whole of Singapore.<br><br>If the Government ordered us to invade a neighboring country, it would be like ordering us to fly to the moon. It is simply impossible, so the lack of freedom in Singapore is not an issue. We simply are unable to invade Malaysia successfully, so we will never try and they need never fear us. The temptation of war does not exist for us. Adventurism is a loser's game for Singapore. The man in the street there may not understand this, but you can be sure their leadership does.<br><br>As for international opinion in the wake of a defensive preemptive strike, it is not as simple as you or On The Way imagine. Any defensive move by Singapore would have been preceded by plenty of diplomatic maneuvering beforehand. The whole world will know our story and the reasons for our actions before we do anything. Our Government may be authoritarian, but they are certainly not stupid. Even the UN Charter permits preemptive strike in the event of an imminent threat to a member nation. We will not be in the wrong, and the world will know it.<br><br>Of course if the enemy strike first, then it is even easier for us. We would be the aggrieved party and would be able to respond with extreme prejudice. The morale of our troops will also be greatly enhanced. In fact, it is clear that the SAF is trying to gain the ability to absorb a first strike, with concrete aircraft hangers, bunkered ammunition storage, etc. It may even be worth the damage for our troops to be roused to righteous fury and the world to be firmly on our side, though I would prefer not to play with human life.<br><br>As for fighting in a foreign land rather than in Singapore where we possess an advantage: we simply have no choice. It is a matter of saving human lives, the lives of our women and children at home. Yes, we are more likely to be killed if we push outward. Our losses will be tremendous. But it is all worth it. That is the whole point of war after all, to risk death so that others might live better lives. It is not ideal, but it simply must be done due to the tragedy of geography. FIBUA in Singapore is simply NOT ACCEPTABLE.<br><br>I do not think a forward defence strategy is at all unworkable, offensive or unwise. It will be awesomely difficult. It will destroy many things, not least our innocence. But the alternative is far worse.<br><br>As an aside, the samurai of ancient Japan were little more than thugs in the service of local lords, kenhor. The vast majority pillaged the countryside and took what they wanted by force when their lords were not keeping them busy in gang wars with other lords. The Japanese simply have a tremendous knack for revisionist history. Even the "chivalrous" knights of Europe were no different. In your story, the samurai would simply have cut down the serf and raped his wife and children before burning down his village for having the temerity to stand up against noblemen like himself. Comparing our potential adversaries to samurai is incredibly silly and disturbing.</div>

On the part of FIBUA in singapore vs forward defence... maybe its not such a bad idea... though i would prefer the FIBUA in southern malaysia rather then in singapore...<br><br>SAF is well trained in FIBUA.. and we all know FIBUA takes a horrendous toll on attackers... if we hold the FIBUA and MAF tries to retake it... they will suffer huge loses... so much so... it begs to wonder... how long can MAF keeps sustaining such massive loses with a force of only 100,000 men?<br><br>in fact.. if SAF sends 500,000 men to do fibua in southern malaysia... assuming the exchange rate of 1 defending soldier for 12 attacker soldier... MAF would need an army of 6 million solder!!! to retake southern johor...<br><br>and if MAF really starts to pour goondo and half baked recruits into FIBUA... their loses will mount and in extreme cases... we could literary depopulate malaysian male population in FIBUA...   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br><br>and since the war is still in full force... we could attempt to depopulate malaysia even further by FAE all their major towns and cities... keep this up... we might loose 100,000 men... but god knows how many millions of malaysians would be dead under the wrath of FAEs, cluster munitions, mines and diseases...<br><br>so much so... a protracted war... could see east malaysia break away with its 10 million population from the federation... as MAF is kaput and there are no one to prevent them from declaring medeka..... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br><br>and once peninsula malaysia population dropped to 5 million...annexing and assimilating malaysia into singapore becomes very very possible... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br><br>so... kenhors' idea do have merits... we are simply too quick to barbecue him....<br><br>our forward defence strategy could not be comparable to kenhor's method... depopulating and annexing malaysia for eternity...<br><br>our foward defence strategy's greatest flaw is in... we could not guarantee future peace after forward defence... this is because... we cant hold malaysia.. and we cant prevent them from rebuilding... nor prevent them from attacking us in the future...<br><br>using kenhor's war strategy... we not merely have a chance to really defend ourselves... but could actually achieve and exceed the aim of fighting a war and being around to pick up the pieces (DPM Lee idea)... now we could annex malaysia!!! <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br><br>lets give kenhor a round of applause... if MAF knew of kenhors' plan... hell.. they wont even want to be near singapore... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"></div>
