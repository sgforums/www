If there was a war in Europe, and if either side was losing, most analyst I have read was that the war will go nuclear. Russia and WP had a policy of winning and surviving a nuclear war. While Nato had a policy of deterrence and MAD. USA had enough weapons to survive a first strike and then will strike back. The russians policy was that of limiting the damage of their cities and ensuring survival of a nuclear war.<br><br>The Americans were able then to focus their attention on economic and social activities while the WPs focus on military. Long story short, they over did it and their economy died. My opinion is that we may face the same scenario.<br><br>As for deterrence, there is a limit to what is used to deter an aggressor, compared to the overkill we currently have. Malaysia's flashy toys to me are not an aggressive platform, as we still have numerical and quantity superiority over them. So we are very much not worried about them coming over.<br><br>Over on the Malaysia side, their economy and country is progressing better than most other countries. Economic prosperity and a Malaysia first policy brings their people together. Hence the fact that Chinese and Malay can work together against a possibly hostile Singapore is the deterrence against us invading them. The equipment is just a force multiplier. But it also acts as a psychological weapon that Malaysia is worth defending.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>To viper<br><br>I actually think that if the Malaysians are serious about the AWACS, they will get the 737 version. That way, they have lots of experience and spare parts .. they have plenty of 737s in MAS and Air Asia .. they run the second largest fleet worldwide outside USA.<br><br>So until they announce the type of plane, we can only guess on the "difficulties" in the logistics, which of course, you are right to mention.</div>

Then he'll be within the operating range of the ground defences. Commandos on the ground with laser designators? Those souped-up laser pointers are pretty short range too, if you can get troopers close in, may as well have them take out the SAM sites/launchers....</strong><br><br>The GBU-10 use by our F-16 have a range of 8Nm , 8 Nm ranged bombs have a very good advantage agaisnt the 8km range Jernas use by Malaysians. I personnally find that the main issue is in targeting not range. LGB are rather inaccurate in foggy days or night , its accuraccy may be affected by rain too. Thus i believe our LGB bombs may have GPS guidance system to improve accuraccy. To increase the range of the LGB , the RSAF might incorporate the LONGSHOT kit onto our LGB , turning it into a short range cruisemissile.<br><br>However y would the RSAF will wanna use the Laser guided bomb agaisnt SAMs in our region. The LGB is a glide plateform , the JERNAS will be able to optically track it and shoot it down before the bomb can even reach the target. The GBU-10 have a circular error porbable of 9meters , 9 meters might mean alot in plinking those SAMs in the woods. I will rather the RSAF to use the Maverick Missiles in SEAD mission , best will be with missile such as ALARMs or HARMs which have stand-off anti-radiation capability.</div>
