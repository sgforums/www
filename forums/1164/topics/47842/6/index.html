            <div class='col-md body'>Kenhor, for all your concern about the feelings and safety of those living in JB and Batu Pahat, you forgot one important thing. Should the Mersing Line be activated to counter a third party invasion of Singapore via Malaysia, it would only mean that the MAF has collapsed and virtually the entire Peninsula from Alor Star to Gemas has fallen. By that time would you think Johoreans would oppose a move northward by us?<br><br>Our dear Dr Albar would probably be personally handing out garlands to every one of the SAF soldiers crossing the Causeway.<br></div>

I agree with most of your points and consider you a voice of reason in this debate. I am S'porean myself, but I try to see both sides and never underestimate a potential adversary no matter how weak or incompetent they may seem. Some points to consider.....<br>- A RMAF AEW will be held far in the north guarded with fighters. This is standard operational practice in many air forces. Its is a fact that the RMAF has already signed an upgrade contract with MAPO to install the Phazontron N0119MF dual BVR radar in all their MIG-29s. In addition, the MIGs are to be upgraded with Vympel R77, which are every bit as competent as the AIM-120. The MIG escorts will take u out BVR if you try to engage the AEW.<br>Also, The RMAF AEW will instantly detect mass take off from all RSAF airfields from the safety of northern malaysia. By the time RSAF a/c pass KL, most of the fighters stationed in Langkawi and Butterworth would already be scrambled. A BVR duel would occur north of KL that will take its toll on the attacking RSAF A/C. Should the remaining RSAF a/c survive this, they can still destroy the airbases and maybe lose a few more to Malaysian SAM and AA activities, and close in "heater" dogfights. By the time they return to S'pore, they will find that all their airbases  plus alternate runways at Changi, PIE, etc,. will be destroyed or cratered by Malaysian MLRS, and long range arty. I predict mass ditching of RSAF a/c in the south china seas. They may all form up on  KC-135 and refuel and do circuits until one of the runway is repaired, but I would'nt bet on it. In the meantime, if the Malaysians are smart (and I am sure they have considered it), they would be sure to retain some strike a/c like their SU-30s in the airbases in East Malaysia. From there, using the AEW for C &amp; C, they can launch long range strikes into S'pore. Also if the AEW has rudimentary Joint Rivets capability, they will  be able to detect the flow of SAF armour and transportation heading towards the causeway and other crossing points. They can direct arty fire or even ground attack a/c on to these routes.<br>This is just one scenario. People seem to forget that RMAF FA-18 Hornets pilots are trained by the US Navy aviators, some of the best in the business. They cannot suka suka pass u if u are a crap pilot. In addition, many high ranking RMAF pilots are actually Chinese, Eurasians or Indians. They do not have the discriminatory policy like the RSAF has. And trust me, these are competent pilots. Russian training is also of high standard. And even if they are not in the air for whatever reason, there is a top of the line MIG-29 flight simulator build by CAE for training RMAF pilots. Also RMAF MIGS have stuff that even the best RSAF a/c doesn't. Like quad bomb release racks for 250 and 500 lbs, and dual engagement BVR radar. I don;t know where all these false bravado is coming from. I know many RSAF pilots personally, some were my neighbuors, some I when to school with, but i have never heard even one of them talk down the RMAF like these people here in the forum. I think all these RMAF-is-a-big-joke forumners better wake up their ideas.<br>[</div></blockquote>ah peh.... you born on which planet one.... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br>RMAF bo amraamski leh... how to do BVR with RSAF falcons armed with sparrow and possibly with derby and amraam and meteor and magic in the future?<br><br>secondly hor...

            <div class='col-md body'>Kenhor,<br><br>I do not think you understand the concept of MAD. It only applies if in a conflict both sides are 100% assured of destroying each other. That is why the superpowers built enough nuclear weapons during the cold war to vaporize each other literally hundreds of times over -- so that no matter how many were disabled or destroyed by enemy action, enough capability would remain to assuredly destroy the other party in return. That is why it is Mutual Assured Destruction.<br><br>We do not have a 100% chance of completely destroying Malaysia. We have a 0% chance of doing that. I think you overestimate our capabilities. We cannot have a strategy that relies on MAD. Comparing our situation to the standoff between NATO and WP is ludicrous. In my opinion, the whole "poisoned shrimp" idea was retarded from the beginning, but it was the best that we could do at the time. Why would an aggressor nation be deterred by the threat of injury if he could inflict death upon us in return?<br><br>No, we must seek victory in war if we wish to deter the enemy. An aggressor must realize that he is likely to LOSE a war with us. That is the surest and most effective form of deterrence. The only war for us to defeat the enemy, and therefore deter him and prevent war is a forward defence doctrine. It is the most humane thing to do. If the temptation of war is removed from potential aggressors, then everyone will live in peace.<br><br>As for the intimidating effect of our forward defence doctrine, I have three things to say:<br><br>Firstly, our neighbors should and do realize that because of the conscript nature of our army, we can never be a force of aggression. We cannot annex another country. We cannot permanently capture and hold ground. We are not trained for counterinsurgency. Our neighbors only sometimes pretend to forget this for domestic political reasons. Regardless of how strong the SAF becomes, she can only be a defensive force. We cannot and therefore will not invade.<br><br>Secondly, the SAF specifically lacks deep strategic strike capability. We do not threaten our neighbors with ballistic or cruise missiles. We have no strategic heavy bombers. We lack sea control platforms like cruisers and aircraft carriers. This means that the SAF is not a force of intimidation. We cannot use the SAF as a stick to make our neighbors do what we want.<br><br>Thirdly, our neighbors are not extending the same courtesy to us that you suggest we extend to them. They threaten us with force or deprivation of water. They parade their military hardware. They try to make us feel insecure. We do none of these things, even to the point of keeping our military strength out of the public eye. Saying that we intimidate our neighbors is the pot calling the kettle black.<br><br>In summary, I do not feel that a forward defence doctrine is at all undiplomatic or unjustified. They have nothing to fear from us and they know it. On the other hand, we have an entire nation to lose. I do not think that the residents of JB should be at all offended or afraid at our military preparations. I would not be in their position. Of course, their warmongering press ensures that the reality is quite different, but that is not our fault.<br><br>Incidentally, a forward defence doctrine is not just the Mersing Line. It is the idea that we will prevent the enemy from reaching Singapore. If we are attacked from the south we will strike them at sea before they reach our shores, possibly capturing some islands to deny them to the enemy and to base our forces. Of course, due to our air and naval capabilities, an attack from the sea would be extremely difficult and unlikely, so we tend to concentrate discussion on the more interesting question of attack from the land.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>To viper<br><br>"How safe do you think they'll feel if we opt to stay on this island and let our enemy use their land as a staging area to invade or besiege us? "<br><br>Firstly, if an enemy lands in johor to invade us, we will not be hitting that enemy in Johor. We will be hitting his capital city with all we got .. killing his expeditionary army won't stop the war. Reducing his capital to ruin will.<br><br>Secondly, killing all our troops in battle will force surrender. Remember that our troops are our citizens. if we fully mobilize and establish the mersing line properly, that sucks up 25% of the male population. Killing that will automatically mean that defending the rest of singapore is impossible. My belief is that it will be easier to kill the SAF troops in Johor, compared to SAF troops in BUA like woodlands.<br><br>Its like the Mummy 2 movie .. what the heck did the defenders of the city in the first scene array themselves in front of the city to meet the enemy? They can wait in the city, endure some bombardment and sortie out .. it makes for a good movie, but I think its a stupid idea.<br><br><strong>Kenhor, for all your concern about the feelings and safety of those living in JB and Batu Pahat, you forgot one important thing. Should the Mersing Line be activated to counter a third party invasion of Singapore via Malaysia, it would only mean that the MAF has collapsed and virtually the entire Peninsula from Alor Star to Gemas has fallen. By that time would you think Johoreans would oppose a move northward by us? </strong><br><br>This is a very hypotetical question ..<br><br>a) Which enemy is going to attack both singapore and Malaysia at the same time<br>b) Which enemy is going to attack both Singapore and Malaysia ONE AT A TIME<br>c) WHY isn't the SAF deployed furthur up north if the intended target was Singapore.<br><br>I will tell you why .. we hope that the Malaysians will be invaded and we stake a claim to some portion of Johor during the fighting. If you can answer questions a)-c) .. you will see no need for a mersing line.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>To nismoS123<br><br><strong>you seem to be missing the point entirely. the basis of any defence stradegy is to keep ourselves alive and our enemies dead. what's the point of defense when we're dead? </strong><br><br>The point of deterrence is to prevent the fighting in the first place. You want a defence strategy, I want a deterrence strategy.<br><br>Defense strategy ties up critical resources .. deterrence frees up the same resources. Singapore has little resources to waste.<br><br><strong>MAD, as you described, works well, on paper, when everything and everyone is reduced to a statistic. you die i die, no one gains, woot. </strong><br><br>That's why its a deterrence. The enemy will have more to lose than us. 14 cities vs 1. Thats a big loss ratio.<br><br><strong>however, try telling a soldier that, let them know that, when the enemy is coming, that they all are to be reduced to kamikaze fighers, to take down as many enemies troops as they can before their own demise. i'm sure that's going to be a great morale booster.</strong><br><br>You may see it that way, I see it as the INVASION of a foreign land .. remember what the japanese did to china ... I am sure the young japanese soldiers though that they were righteous when they went to defend japanese interests during ww2.<br><br></div>
