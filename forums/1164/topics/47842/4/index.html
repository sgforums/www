            <div class='col-md body'>Kenhor,<br><br>to summarise I think your defence of "Deterrence at all costs" quite lacking in foresight. The Cold War might have been a success for deterrence, but history is littered with incidences where deterrence has failed. What we see here is us having a strategy of deterrence, but also a backup plan should that deterrence fail where not only will we not lose, we will try to win.<br><br>You just seem to be happy to think that should deterrence fail, its good enough to give the enemy a Phyrric victory. You say this will allow Singaporeans to survive, but I think thats plain naive. If we bloody the enemy's nose(along with our own) so that he will "not be able to enjoy the fruits of his victory"(your words), I fear terrible retribution will be exacted upon those who have survived the war. Again, history is full of such examples<br><br>Call me selfish, but its not good enough for me, nor for many people, I would think.<br><br>I see that it is pointless to try to sway your point of view, and it is the same for you to try to do the same to me. Our debate shall end here with me thanking my lucky stars defence planners here do not share your view.<br><br>Good day</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>To Viper52<br><br><strong>And thank goodness its not our defence planners idea of deterrence as well, because your idea of deterrence would not only ensure Singapore's defenders will die defending Singapore, all our family members as well what we have worked so hard to create will end up in one huge wasteland. </strong><br><br>Its my opinion. You asked me for it. I gave it to you.<br><br><strong>You seem to be happy to accept that if deterrence fails, you'll happily see Singapore laid waste to, and everyone dies. I'm sorry, but if deterrence fails, I'd rather give it a crack to try to keep my family alive. </strong><br><br>The USA were happy with the theory that if WP attacked Nato, USA will risk USA just for the sake of the Europeans. i.e WP devastate Germany, USA nuke Moscow and Moscow nuke USA .. that kept the peace for nearly 50 years. Thats what MAD is.<br><br><strong>Rubbish...if we sit in here and wait for the enemy to come like you suggest, the likely result will be a siege where we will be pounded into the dirt or we'll have a deathmatch in the streets. Either way, A LOT of Singaporeans will die and the country laid waste to </strong><br><br>If you look at the weapons that both sides have nowadays, there is less fighting on the street than the scenario you are painting. Our weaponary is actually very long distance .. do you honestly think that the enemy can just sit in arty range and lob shells into the island without getting hit in return? One hit into Singapore, we flatten KL. the next hit, we do it to Penang .. and so on and so forth .. even before the first troop crosses the causeway, I can guarantee that there will be more damage to their cities than to ours. So what kind of need will there be for our troops to invade up to the Mersing line for?<br><br><strong>By that same token, you are a lot friendlier to Malaysians than a lot of Malaysians are towards Singaporeans in general. Theres an anti-Malaysian undercurrent here, but the feeling is not one-sided, and worse still, a lot of the same kind of opinions expressed here are expressed by politicians and the mainstream press over there? So why pick on the forummers here alone for such sentiments? </strong><br><br>I didn't pick on them first .. they picked on me. Every time I try to have a decent discussion, I get flammed even while I am very polite.<br><br><strong>While we're on the topic of the last war, it does show the folly of attempting to make a last stand in Singapore proper </strong><br><br>It also shows the folly of not working together and letting the enemy pick you off little by little.<br><br><strong>Sure, and most here accept that fact, what we're picking on is their assertions that it is to counter "pre-emptive" strikes, which are comments obviously directed southwards towards us(especially) and Australia. </strong><br><br>I will definately feel that they should buy the AWACS .. its make better sense than continually buying fighters ... what is wrong with that?<br><br><strong>I have spoken out against the Mersing Line strategy in this forum before, but I also feel that its the best strategy in the circumstances in the absence of a better one and a certainly whole lot better than your "Singapore Deathmatch" option </strong><br><br>Ok .. you may like it .. but I don't so we can agree to disagree on this .</div>

Malaysia has no E2Cs in their inventory. But they have lots of 737s.<br><br>They have a new carrier Air Asia who is a discount airline.

            <div class='col-md body'>Kenhor,<br>I think you are wasting your breath here with a lot of xenophobes, who cannot admit that the RMAF may be up to something and that they are capable and posess some element of power. I agree with most of your points and consider you a voice of reason in this debate. I am S'porean myself, but I try to see both sides and never underestimate a potential adversary no matter how weak or incompetent they may seem. Some points to consider.....<br>- A RMAF AEW will be held far in the north guarded with fighters. This is standard operational practice in many air forces. Its is a fact that the RMAF has already signed an upgrade contract with MAPO to install the Phazontron N0119MF dual BVR radar in all their MIG-29s. In addition, the MIGs are to be upgraded with Vympel R77, which are every bit as competent as the AIM-120. The MIG escorts will take u out BVR if you try to engage the AEW.<br>Also, The RMAF AEW will instantly detect mass take off from all RSAF airfields from the safety of northern malaysia. By the time RSAF a/c pass KL, most of the fighters stationed in Langkawi and Butterworth would already be scrambled. A BVR duel would occur north of KL that will take its toll on the attacking RSAF A/C. Should the remaining RSAF a/c survive this, they can still destroy the airbases and maybe lose a few more to Malaysian SAM and AA activities, and close in "heater" dogfights. By the time they return to S'pore, they will find that all their airbases plus alternate runways at Changi, PIE, etc,. will be destroyed or cratered by Malaysian MLRS, and long range arty. I predict mass ditching of RSAF a/c in the south china seas. They may all form up on  KC-135 and refuel and do circuits until one of the runway is repaired, but I would'nt bet on it. In the meantime, if the Malaysians are smart (and I am sure they have considered it), they would be sure to retain some strike a/c like their SU-30s in the airbases in East Malaysia. From there, using the AEW for C &amp; C, they can launch long range strikes into S'pore. Also if the AEW has rudimentary Joint Rivets capability, they will  be able to detect the flow of SAF armour and transportation heading towards the causeway and other crossing points. They can direct arty fire or even ground attack a/c on to these routes.<br>This is just one scenario. People seem to forget that RMAF FA-18 Hornets pilots are trained by the US Navy aviators, some of the best in the business. They cannot suka suka pass u if u are a crap pilot. In addition, many high ranking RMAF pilots are actually Chinese, Eurasians or Indians. They do not have the discriminatory policy like the RSAF has. And trust me, these are competent pilots. Russian training is also of high standard. And even if they are not in the air for whatever reason, there is a top of the line MIG-29 flight simulator build by CAE for training RMAF pilots. Also RMAF MIGS have stuff that even the best RSAF a/c doesn't. Like quad bomb release racks for 250 and 500 lbs, and dual engagement BVR radar. I don;t know where all these false bravado is coming from. I know many RSAF pilots personally, some were my neighbuors, some I when to school with, but i have never heard even one of them talk down the RMAF like these people here in the forum. I think all these RMAF-is-a-big-joke forumners better wake up their ideas.<br>[<blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by kenhor:</div><div class="quote_body">To kanzer<br><br>The sampans and speedboat is indeed not detectable by the AWACS .. but container ships and LNG carriers are.<br><br>As for datalinks between their Navy and Army, that project is a money maker for big business  .. hence will definately do it.<br><br>An AWACS is multirole, compared to MPA which is single role.
