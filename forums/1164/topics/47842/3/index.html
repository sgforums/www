At this moment, SABAH has to depend on Malaysia for its security .. it is infested with Philippinos. So much needed security forces are need to keep all the undesirables away. Add that to the economic benefits of a huge military presence, they have no cause for complain.<br><br>Of course, the Philippinos are doing Malaysia a big favour actually, with all that noise they are making and the chaos, Sabah will prefer to be safe.<br><br><strong>secondly... if malaysia is really interested in the economic benefit of the people of sabah... they malaysian govt has far easier and better means of improving sabah's economy through infrastructure construction... the truth is.. malaysia fear that a well off sabah would be the trigger that will see sabah seceed from the federation like singapore... </strong><br><br>If Malaysia is the best show in town, the Sabahans will be very happy to remain in the federation. After all, which other country is doing better and will do a better job running Sabah? Brunei? Singapore .. don't make me laugh.<br><br><strong>thus malaysia doesnt want to see a sucessful sabah as it believe that a weak sabah would be continuously dependent and thus obedient to the federal govt... which is wat inignited the anti-federation sentiments in sabah... </strong><br><br>Very interesting scenario .. but you left out the political dimension. Politics is what keeps sabah in the federation. Unfortunately, with Singapore's one party rule, there is little example the Sabahans can gain from us to make them want to leave .. most wil fear the repression that we have to undergo.<br><br>In Ipoh, the local town council just did an experiment .. they started acting like us .. imposing fines, clampdown on vice, shaming criminals in public etc .. the people there are already complaining .. so if our way of life is unable to be stomached by the city folk of Ipoh, don't expect it to go down better with the Sabahans.<br><br><strong>lastly... having a sub base in east malaysia does not limits its sub movement to only east malaysia and south china sea... they could afterall return to peninsula for special ops as peninsula also got naval base.. though not a sub base... but it will do....</strong><br><br>Of course .. it makes sense to have 2 bases .. just in case one kaput.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Kenhor<br><br>[quote]Originally posted by kenhor:<br><strong>The point of deterrence is not to win the war but to prevent one from happening. Hence the deterrence by NATO works .. as they knew the WP was planning to survive a nuclear war .. so all NATO had to do was to ensure that was not possible. Once they had enough, they can divert resources to their economy. We have to do the same .. ensure that we have enough deterrence and to heck with anything else they buy .. we want them to go bankrupt .. not the other way around.</strong><br><br>Of course deterrence is about preventing war. But how do you prevent war if your potential enemy has a fair crack at winning? The point of deterrence has to be that you must show your enemy that he WILL not win. Then he will be DETERRED from attacking.<br><br>You yourself have said NATO succeeded at deterrence because the WP knew its plans to survive a nuclear exchange will not succeed. Our objective for deterrence is prevent the enemy from occupying and/or destroying Singapore isn't it? So we must make it clear that we have a clear plan from stopping that from happening, otherwise what deterrence is it when the enemy thinks he can succeed<br><br>Let me reiterate here, the plan is not just aimed at your beloved Malaysia, it is to counter any moves to invade Singapore via Malaysia(which due to surrounding geography is the only realistic way of successfully invading Singapore). If you have taken time off from studying palm oil economics to read "Defending the Lion City", you would have read that Singapore's strategy is to move into the Mersing Line should it feel that its threatened "with or without Malaysias acquisience". That last part has always been conveniently ignored by critics of the strategy in Malaysia and makes it clear that unlike them(and you) we do not see everything in a Singapore vs Malaysia context<br><br>Sigh...I've said it before, there has been no introduction of new capabilities other than the Apaches for long long time other than those to counter newer regional capabilities(eg ASW frigates to counter submarines). The others have been to replace existing capabilities which are obsolete. Or would you prefer that if the worst case scenario occurs and deterrence fails, you would like to fight with obsolete 30-year old weapons<br><br><strong>In fact, I disagree totally with forward defense as it will spare our infrastrucutre but bleed our citizens. If we intend to invade an enemy, we need to outnumber them .. hence we probably need to mobilize our entire male population if we are serious about defeating them in a scenario where we go it alone. Each death of a soldier is equivalent to the death of a civillian. So I prefer to wait in a defendable position rather then go into a hostile environment where terrain suits the defender.</strong><br><br>You really don't get it do you? Foward defence IS us moving into a defensible position. That position is the so-called Mersing Line and it is a lot more defensible position that holding out in Singapore simply because we're so small<br><br>If forward defense is so disagreeable for you, then I ask you again, to propose an alternative on this forum. Like I've said, I'm sure a lot of us here would like to hear of it.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>To viper<br><br><strong>potential enemy has a fair crack at winning? The point of deterrence has to be that you must show your enemy that he WILL not win. Then he will be DETERRED from attacking. </strong><br><br>Thats your version of deterrence .. my version is that if he does win, he won't be around to enjoy the fruits of victory, either because he is no longer around or the thing which he wants is no longer there.<br><br>My idea of deterrence is the story of a samurai who wants to cross the bridge the same time as a peasant. The samurai being more higher in ranked wants to challenge the peasant to a fight. So the peasant knows that he will die if he fights, yet he wants to cross the bridge .. so he learns a fighting stance that will lose the fight, but will guarantee that samurai dies as well. Once the samurai knows that the peasant is willing to die, the samurai, who has more to live for, backs off.<br><br>That is my idea of deterrence.<br><br><strong>You yourself have said NATO succeeded at deterrence because the WP knew its plans to survive a nuclear exchange will not succeed. Our objective for deterrence is prevent the enemy from occupying and/or destroying Singapore isn't it? So we must make it clear that we have a clear plan from stopping that from happening, otherwise what deterrence is it when the enemy thinks he can succeed </strong><br><br>Actually, my idea is for SINGAPOREAN PEOPLE to survive .. I care nothing for infrastructure .. so forward defense is not my preference as a good strategy as it involves sending lots of soldiers (aka Singapore citizens) to die in a foreign land.<br><br><strong>Let me reiterate here, the plan is not just aimed at your beloved Malaysia, it is to counter any moves to invade Singapore via Malaysia(which due to surrounding geography is the only realistic way of successfully invading Singapore). If you have taken time off from studying palm oil economics to read "Defending the Lion City", you would have read that Singapore's strategy is to move into the Mersing Line should it feel that its threatened "with or without Malaysias acquisience". That last part has always been conveniently ignored by critics of the strategy in Malaysia and makes it clear that unlike them(and you) we do not see everything in a Singapore vs Malaysia context </strong><br><br>If there was a third party who wish to invade Singapore via Malaysia, our first policy will be to make peace with the Malaysians and integrate our forces to something like NATO , not invade them just fo the sake of our security. Thats like using someone elses body to block a bullet. That person will not be very happy. .. However, I don't see that we have noble intentions towards the north anyway. .. and from all the posts, we have plenty of people who are antagonistic towards Malays, Malaysians, etc .. so no point trying to convince me that the potential enemy is a third party.<br><br>In fact, during the last war, it was the defenders of Malaya who fought a rear guard action from the north all the way to the south. If there is a third party, we definately need the Malaysians to fight a rear guard action or to divert the enemy partially towards KL .. friendship is definately more important than a forward defence. And I can truly say that I am definately more friendly towards the north than many of the members here.<br><br><strong>Sigh...I've said it before, there has been no introduction of new capabilities other than the Apaches for long long time other than those to counter newer regional capabilities(eg ASW frigates to counter submarines). The others have been to replace existing capabilities which are obsolete. Or would you prefer that if the worst case scenario occurs and deterrence fails, you would like to fight with obsolete 30-year old weapons </strong><br><br>If you turn your statement around, that justifies the entire Malaysian arms purchases. They have been sucking hind tit for last 30 years. Its now time for them to modernize.<br><br><strong>You really don't get it do you? Foward defence IS us moving into a defensible position. That position is the so-called Mersing Line and it is a lot more defensible position that holding out in Singapore simply because we're so small </strong><br><br>And you don't get how porus the mersing line is do you .. if you can tell me how we can defend the mersing line which strecthes from Mersing, along highway 50 down to Batu Pahat and keep infiltrators from attacking our rear areas. That is 100km in a straight line. That line divides Johore into 2 .. that southern portion has MOST of the johore population. And you can tell me that whoever we send up north to defend that line will not face attacks in front, behind and at the flanks?<br><br><strong>If forward defense is so disagreeable for you, then I ask you again, to propose an alternative on this forum. Like I've said, I'm sure a lot of us here would like to hear of it. </strong><br><br>My idea of deterrence is like the samurai story above.</div>

I am sure that some of the forum members here will believe that the opinons of you and the IRISH akido association will reflect very accurately on how the samurai in medieval japan actually behaved, compared to what they were supposed to behave.<br><br>Unfortunately, I don't.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>Thats your version of deterrence .. my version is that if he does win, he won't be around to enjoy the fruits of victory, either because he is no longer around or the thing which he wants is no longer there.<br><br>My idea of deterrence is the story of a samurai who wants to cross the bridge the same time as a peasant. The samurai being more higher in ranked wants to challenge the peasant to a fight. So the peasant knows that he will die if he fights, yet he wants to cross the bridge .. so he learns a fighting stance that will lose the fight, but will guarantee that samurai dies as well. Once the samurai knows that the peasant is willing to die, the samurai, who has more to live for, backs off.<br><br>That is my idea of deterrence.</strong><br><br>And thank goodness its not our defence planners idea of deterrence as well, because your idea of deterrence would not only ensure Singapore's defenders will die defending Singapore, all our family members as well what we have worked so hard to create will end up in one huge wasteland SHOULD THAT DETERRENCE FAIL.<br><br>You seem to be happy to accept that if deterrence fails, you'll happily see Singapore laid waste to, and everyone dies. I'm sorry, but if deterrence fails, I'd rather give it a crack to try to keep my family alive.<br><br><strong>Actually, my idea is for SINGAPOREAN PEOPLE to survive .. I care nothing for infrastructure .. so forward defense is not my preference as a good strategy as it involves sending lots of soldiers (aka Singapore citizens) to die in a foreign land.</strong><br><br>Rubbish...if we sit in here and wait for the enemy to come like you suggest, the likely result will be a siege where we will be pounded into the dirt or we'll have a deathmatch in the streets. Either way, A LOT of Singaporeans will die and the country laid waste to<br><br><strong>If there was a third party who wish to invade Singapore via Malaysia, our first policy will be to make peace with the Malaysians and integrate our forces to something like NATO , not invade them just fo the sake of our security. Thats like using someone elses body to block a bullet. That person will not be very happy. .. However, I don't see that we have noble intentions towards the north anyway. .. and from all the posts, we have plenty of people who are antagonistic towards Malays, Malaysians, etc .. so no point trying to convince me that the potential enemy is a third party.<br><br>In fact, during the last war, it was the defenders of Malaya who fought a rear guard action from the north all the way to the south. If there is a third party, we definately need the Malaysians to fight a rear guard action or to divert the enemy partially towards KL .. friendship is definately more important than a forward defence. And I can truly say that I am definately more friendly towards the north than many of the members here.</strong><br><br>By that same token, you are a lot friendlier to Malaysians than a lot of Malaysians are towards Singaporeans in general. Theres an anti-Malaysian undercurrent here, but the feeling is not one-sided, and worse still, a lot of the same kind of opinions expressed here are expressed by politicians and the mainstream press over there? So why pick on the forummers here alone for such sentiments?<br><br>While we're on the topic of the last war, it does show the folly of attempting to make a last stand in Singapore proper<br><br><strong>If you turn your statement around, that justifies the entire Malaysian arms purchases. They have been sucking hind tit for last 30 years. Its now time for them to modernize.</strong><br><br>Sure, and most here accept that fact, what we're picking on is their assertions that it is to counter "pre-emptive" strikes, which are comments obviously directed southwards towards us(especially) and Australia.<br><br><strong>And you don't get how porus the mersing line is do you .. if you can tell me how we can defend the mersing line which strecthes from Mersing, along highway 50 down to Batu Pahat and keep infiltrators from attacking our rear areas. That is 100km in a straight line. That line divides Johore into 2 .. that southern portion has MOST of the johore population. And you can tell me that whoever we send up north to defend that line will not face attacks in front, behind and at the flanks?</strong><br><br>I have spoken out against the Mersing Line strategy in this forum before, but I also feel that its the best strategy in the circumstances in the absence of a better one and a certainly whole lot better than your "Singapore Deathmatch" option<br><br><strong>My idea of deterrence is like the samurai story above.</strong><br><br>And as Gun said, its half-baked</div>
