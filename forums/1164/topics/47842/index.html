It provides better control of airspace and detect any incoming aircraft or missiles at an early stage."<br><br>"That alone represents an effective counter-measures against any move to launch a pre-emptive strike," Asian Defence Journal's Editor M.G Mahmud told Bernama when contacted.<br><br>During the recently concluded Asia Security Conference in Singapore, Australian Defence Minister Robert Hill reignited the controversy about pre-emptive strikes by saying that Canberra was prepared to defy international law in order to protect its citizens.<br><br>"There will be limited circumstances in which self defence will require anticipatory action to pre-empt adversaries unleashing massive destruction," he said.<br><br>Last week, Royal Malaysian Air Force (RMAF) Chief Gen Abdullah Ahmad said the country needed a minimum of four AEW&amp;C aircraft to bolster the surveillance of its airspace.<br><br>Defence Minister Datuk Seri Najib Tun Razak in replying to Abdullah's comment on RMAF need for the AEW&amp;C platform said, the purchase of such aircraft needed a thorough study as it involved huge financial commitments.<br><br>Mahmud said, the RMAF should already have the AEW&amp;C in its inventory as the system was essential for a modern air force.<br><br>He said ground-based radar could have its limitations as aircraft flying at low levels close to the ground or "Nap-On-Earth" (NOE) flight could evade detection.<br><br>"From an operating altitude of above 25,000 feet, an AEW&amp;C aircraft can extend the radar horizon by overcoming the line-of-sight limitations imposed on ground-based and shipboard radar systems," he said.<br><br>Meanwhile a defence analyst Prasun Sengupta said, there was a genuine requirement for the RMAF to acquire AEW&amp;C especially to enhance its battle management system and airspace control.<br><br>The air force he said, was in the midst of assessing several types of AEW&amp;C with the EMB-145 "Erieye" expected to come out as the main contender for the government contract.<br><br>Other contenders for the RMAF's requirement are Boeing 737-700, Saab 2000 and Northrop Grumman's E-2C Hawkeye. In the Southeast Asian region, the Republic of Singapore Air Force (RSAF) remained the sole armed force with the AEW&amp;C platform with four American-made E-2C Hawkeye acting as her eyes in the sky.<br><br>Prasun said, the 18 Sukhoi SU-30MKM which would be purchased by Malaysia could also act as an AEW&amp;C platform as its passive phased-array radar could detect enemy aircraft some 320km away.

RSAF falcons got python 4, derby and sparrow plus (rumor from the north which i seriously doubt) AMRAAM as well ...<br><br>i think a fight between local falcons and the northern barbarians would see a turkey shot for RSAF ... irreguardless they got awac or no awac...<br><br>so... let them be lah... let they brag all they want... as far as i see it... the malaysian air force are still highly dependent on foreign nations.. like russia... under such a situation... i would love to see if russia would support their any attempt to start a war with singapore.... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br><br>no russian support.. no spare part, no engineer, no missile, no bullet... the RMAF pilots might as well fly in a malaysia layang and throw coconut bomb.... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"></div>

There's no such thing as a dumb enemy and I'm sure despite their constnt hicups, Malaysia will not present itself to be anysort of a dumb opponent, if it comes down to that that is. Never belittle your oponent, potential ones or not. If they want to, it's up to them.<br><br>What do you expect them to do? Roll over and die? Well they may hold such a conempt for Singapore on many occasions, expecting us to take it lying down and just agree to them, and getting angry when we don't, we cannot make the mistake of following them in their mistakes.<br><br>After all, malaysia is the country which daringly said it had the right to say whatever it wants about the US but never fails to keep warning Singapore that it should be "sensitive" (in which case sensitive in their terms is to lick their boots) and attempts to stick their nose in whatever we speak whenever it serves them to drive up votes.</div>

We spent a number of years before we inter-link our planes and ship to the AWACS............ so buying AWACS is one thing. Integrating them is another...... the cost involve in integrating them is not cheap. than comes out a couple of hundred million ringgit...... As well, the AWACS deal is most likely to be a straight cash deal.... no palm oil this time round <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz"> ..... try offering it the americans..... they will most likely to throw the offer and the offerer out of the window....... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_surprised.gif" alt="Surprised" title="Surprised">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_surprised.gif" alt="Surprised" title="Surprised">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_surprised.gif" alt="Surprised" title="Surprised"><br><br>by the way, the aussies do have the range to strike SEA technically speaking. without refuelling, their F-111 can reach Jakarta...... with tankers, they are able to launch pre-emptive air strikes throughout SEA......but this is not likely since they have more to lose strategically than win........ unlike uncle sam they are <span style="font-style: italic;">not</span> a military power.......</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Dear Tripwire,<br><br>The initial purchase of the AWACs is for 4 aircraft .. they never said thats all they will be buying. They have a long learning curve up ahead .. so they buy 4 first for training. Just like the subs .. do you honestly think that their entire submarine fleet will consist of 2 subs?<br><br>And I never said that they will be challenging China .. so don't put words in my mouth .. you have some issues with the Malays .. the rest of us don't. They are going to put some assets to project force into the South China Sea .. and if you look at the map of our region, the countries with the most coastline bordering the South China Sea are China, Philippines, Vietnam and Malaysia. They have a right and duty to protect their coastline.<br><br>And you also said in some of your posts that the Malaysians should not consider us as their only threat .. by buying the AWACS, they have demonstrated that very clearly .. so you of all people should be happy that they are buying the AWACS.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>To Kanzer,<br><br>The AWACS are dual purpose aircraft .. they can co-ordinate lots of aircrafts to do a strike mission OR they can detect ships that surface borne radar can not.<br><br>You have to look at the bigger picture when dealing with Malaysia. There is ample evidence of what they can do with the Aircraft. What is Malaysia's role? They are a trading nation, and also a natural resource producer. They are an emerging tourism destination as well as a new transhipment port.<br><br>What are the main dangers for those 4 economic activity? War? Nope. Its piracy. If you read the shipping times, Malaysia, Indonesia and Singapore waters have the highest reported incidents of piracy. Some range from just robbery. But the more daring cases are where whole ships are captured and made to dissappear.<br><br>Imagine the economic damage if one of Malaysia's LNG carriers plying the waters between Bintulu and Japan is taken by pirates? The worst case scenario would be that floating time bomb be taken to Tokyo Bay and detonated.<br><br>Having an AWACS may not stop piracy from happening but you will be able to track all comings and goings a lot better. So lets all just look at the possible use of the equipment before thinking its all for an invasion or some plot against Singapore.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Slowpoke, theres no need for designator aircraft to fly within range of SHORADS when designating LGBs. It can be done from high altitude. In fact it would be better at medium to high altitudes because your designator can see further. So with LGBs and designating systems like the LANTIRN or Litening, everyone can stay high and be safe from SHORADS.<br><br>Kanzer, the Aussies can indeed reach Jakarta and all of SEA with tanker support in theory, but the Pig fleet is VERY old and unreliable. Sure, they boast about 100% servicability during red Flag, but do you know the effort and cost needed to do that. As for tanker, the RAAF is left with 4 old clapped-out ex-Qantas 707s.<br><br>Tripwire, AEWACs can be jammed, but its pretty difficult as most have very powerful sets and increasingly come with ECCM. As for Su-30 without AMRAAMski against F-16s with AMRAAM, I think there'll be no doubt about the result.</div>
