            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by Gun:</div><div class="quote_body"><span style="color: red;">Question 1:<br>How does an airline budget its commerical operation cost by including the maintanenc of  military a/c?  Unless you are referring to contracted aerospace engineering firm, i do not see this as feasible option in the eyes of  MAS investors nor any commercial benefit for its line of business.<br><br>Question 2:<br>How does one conclude that purchasing decision centres around the economy of maintaining an AEW&amp;C aircraft alone and not its avionics and surveillance  systems ? Whatever happened to faulty electronics switches, scheduled firnware changes, radar transmitter burns,  operation glitch fixes, software/communication interface &amp; upgrades, etc etc ?<br>Better still, to save cost, might as well convert existing MAS Boeing 737and stick  traffic police radar guns on its wings !<br><br>Question 3:<br>Unless you are refering to Red Barons' biplane, please do pray  tell which current military planes "do not often carry blackboxes" ???</span></div></blockquote>All military planes as common sense will tell you do not carry black boxes though transports,training planes and the likes might.Helicopters also do not carry blackboxes.Why?Well having it land in someone else's land is not really gonna do you any good now is it?Sure they could always take it out when doing covert ops or stuff but  it would save time if they just left it out and put in more electronics in it's place(this is especially so in bombers and recon planes).Also fighter planes do not have space for them.<br>It was in the papers a few years ago that in some country(European i think) a plane crashed and they had problems determining the cause due to a lack of blackboxes in military planes.<br><br>In response to Question 2 well yes those are costs also but having all that cost PLUS the need to mantain the airframe will add to the cost.In fact mantain the airframe alone will take up around 20% of the mantaince cost with the crew sucking up at least 50%(for 3 crews per plane).It would be prudent to cut as much cost as possible is it not?<br>And also once they have the ability to operate,repair/replace the radar and upgrade would it not be possible for them to upgrade a few "former" MAS B737's?<br><br>Question 1 well the RMAF would most prob get parts and training from MAS thus reducing cost once again.Or a Malaysian firm could be contracted to do it.They could possibly create an engineering company to mantain their military B737's and also MAS B737's<br>Much like how our ST eng does some civilian work too.<br>Hope that answers your questions?</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by On the way:</div><div class="quote_body">Kenhor,<br>I think you are wasting your breath here with a lot of xenophobes, who cannot admit that the RMAF may be up to something and that they are capable and posess some element of power. I agree with most of your points and consider you a voice of reason in this debate. I am S'porean myself, but I try to see both sides and never underestimate a potential adversary no matter how weak or incompetent they may seem. Some points to consider.....<br>- A RMAF AEW will be held far in the north guarded with fighters. This is standard operational practice in many air forces. Its is a fact that the RMAF has already signed an upgrade contract with MAPO to install the Phazontron N0119MF dual BVR radar in all their MIG-29s. In addition, the MIGs are to be upgraded with Vympel R77, which are every bit as competent as the AIM-120. The MIG escorts will take u out BVR if you try to engage the AEW.<br>Also, The RMAF AEW will instantly detect mass take off from all RSAF airfields from the safety of northern malaysia. By the time RSAF a/c pass KL, most of the fighters stationed in Langkawi and Butterworth would already be scrambled. A BVR duel would occur north of KL that will take its toll on the attacking RSAF A/C. Should the remaining RSAF a/c survive this, they can still destroy the airbases and maybe lose a few more to Malaysian SAM and AA activities, and close in "heater" dogfights. By the time they return to S'pore, they will find that all their airbases plus alternate runways at Changi, PIE, etc,. will be destroyed or cratered by Malaysian MLRS, and long range arty. I predict mass ditching of RSAF a/c in the south china seas. They may all form up on  KC-135 and refuel and do circuits until one of the runway is repaired, but I would'nt bet on it. In the meantime, if the Malaysians are smart (and I am sure they have considered it), they would be sure to retain some strike a/c like their SU-30s in the airbases in East Malaysia. From there, using the AEW for C &amp; C, they can launch long range strikes into S'pore. Also if the AEW has rudimentary Joint Rivets capability, they will  be able to detect the flow of SAF armour and transportation heading towards the causeway and other crossing points. They can direct arty fire or even ground attack a/c on to these routes.<br>This is just one scenario. People seem to forget that RMAF FA-18 Hornets pilots are trained by the US Navy aviators, some of the best in the business. They cannot suka suka pass u if u are a crap pilot. In addition, many high ranking RMAF pilots are actually Chinese, Eurasians or Indians. They do not have the discriminatory policy like the RSAF has. And trust me, these are competent pilots. Russian training is also of high standard. And even if they are not in the air for whatever reason, there is a top of the line MIG-29 flight simulator build by CAE for training RMAF pilots. Also RMAF MIGS have stuff that even the best RSAF a/c doesn't. Like quad bomb release racks for 250 and 500 lbs, and dual engagement BVR radar. I don;t know where all these false bravado is coming from. I know many RSAF pilots personally, some were my neighbuors, some I when to school with, but i have never heard even one of them talk down the RMAF like these people here in the forum. I think all these RMAF-is-a-big-joke forumners better wake up their ideas.<br>[</div></blockquote>You seemed to have ruled out the fact that we have more planes and that some of our F-16's are stationed overseas.Also fighter planes can take off in 800m of runway....i'm sure we have many islands that can handle that.Also what makes you think we do not have the Aim-120's and SAM's and AA that the Malaysians in your situation have used to such deverstating effect?<br>Oh and no i'm not belittlering the Malaysian armed forces in fact i give them alot of credit and would pay attention and not write them off.However i will not write off our armed forces either</div>

Parts are cheaper in the 737 then the E-2(Economies of Scale).  FBW more difficult to maintain then mechanical linkages? I dun think so too. running diagnostic software is more difficult then opening up the cowlings and inspecting the linkages?<br><br>Nevertheless, choosing the 737 does not mean it would be easier to maintain internally. there are structural changes to accomodate the weight and heat of the avionics and the electrical requirements are higher than a commercial 737.<br><br>the greatest advantage of the 737 would be its altitude. you can see alot of sky at FL 350. Advantages of a ESA radar. All this are just talking cock on the malaysian side. They dun have the $ to purse this option. Maybe the next 5 year plan.<br><br>A few years ago, DSO n RSAF held a public workshop in NUS and I happen to drop in and attend. The head of DSO was introducing the LALEE at that time and on the power point slides, one of the reasons for pursuing the LALEE was the high costs of maintaining the E-2C. </div></blockquote>Thank you for clearing that up.

We started out with the "poison shrimp" doctrine since the 1970s, which was kind of like your defeatist strategy, whereby "If you want to eat us, you'll be poisoned" but that changed in the early 1990s when we realised that the "poison shrimp" analogy would do us no good because in the end, we will not survive as well.<br><br>Like I've said, the forward defence strategy is not directed just at Malaysia, but it has been warped by 2-bit politicians trying to score political points as well as segments of the nationalist press with their own agendas into looking like it is one directed against Malaysia alone.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Dear dkhoo<br><br>You are welcome in your opinion that in our point of view, that we need such a policy of forward defense to safeguard our homes and families.<br><br>Its my duty to remind you that war is hell, as you have portrayed. Whatever you posted is what people in the battlefield and sieged cities will feel. But do yourself a favour. Put yourself in the Malaysians shoes.<br><br>Can you imagine an enemy who for 30 years declared that the only way they feel secure is to invade you the moment you harbour any animosity towards them. Can you imagine that they will take your land, resources and people just to feel safe. Can you imagine that these people have no regard for your own feelings of security.<br><br>Thats why I am advocating the doomsday scenario. If I die, you will die with me. MAD. Mutually assured destruction. If I know what you want, all I have to do is to ensure that you will never get what you want even if you kill me. That sort of thing.<br><br>This theory has kept the peace in Europe for 50 years .. can you tell me which country has got forward defense as their main policy and how long did that peace last?<br><br>I do not advocate war .. and my belief is that MAD has kept the peace longer than "forward defense" Hence I do not consider myself sick. I consider myself a pacifist, and to me human lives are too precious to squander just so that we can feel "safe"<br><br>I re-iterate again .. think of yourself as the poor peasant. Wife kids hard life. The aggressor is an arrogant samurai. Both need to cross the bridge. The samurai challenges the peasant to a fight due to his reputation being at stake. The peasant won't back down because he is right. He learns a lethal stance .. which guarantees the death of both combatants if ever used ... the samurai, who knows that its foolish to lose his life over such trivial matters will have to withdraw.<br><br>That is deterrence. Thats my opinon.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Dear Viper52<br><br><strong>Friend, don't you know that there are already arty units ALREADY in range? So if we don't move in and take them out and hold their firing positions, how are the jets gonna operate? </strong><br><br>I don't think that if anyone wants to kick of a conflict, they will just send their arty. They will have to mobilize EVERYTHING. If we can't spot that, we deserve to die. We have been mobilizing for years .. our readiness is much better than anyone in SEA. Telling me that we need the forward defense as a compliment to our intel is a joke. By the time their main strength comes close, we are all ready.<br><br>And I may not know much, but launching an offensive into a hardened defensive position manned by ready troops is suicide.<br><br><strong>Again, NATO can afford that because W Europe is so large compred to Singapore.

Because Doktor M. and whoever that's gonna follow can't bring that out as an option without sparking world wide criticism, not to mention that back at home. This is not NATO and WP.
