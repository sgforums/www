As this item now requires you to return back to QM when your ORD)<br>Things to bring back:-<br>(Basically, just like going for a trip)<br>a.) Your Army uniforms set. This includes, No.4, army socks, PT socks, jockey cap(if you have), beret (some units must have for parades) How many sets you have, bring back.<br>b.) PT attire<br>c.) Underwear<br>d.) PT shoes, slippers<br>e.) Toiletries.<br>f.) Others (such as some shorts, t-shirts,etc)<br><br>2.) Not sure about "Phase Date" though. Typo?<br><br>3.) 1st ICT training varies from unit to unit. So this will be up to your CO.<br><br>Basically, when you reach camp, there will be signs on where to go.<br>Report in you No.4. Proceed to the Inprocess counter, after which you will be told which coy to report to and proceed to the coy holding area.<br><br>Your head (be it PC, PS, etc) will bring you to your bunks to put your brang brang. After which, there is usually a parade, followed by a speech by your CO briefing you want to exepect in your ICT.<br><br>The rest of the day will be up to the training schedule. Some I see are lobo on the first day, draw arms, do some cleaning up, go emart. Some go into training immediately. So depends on your unit.<br><br>The above is what I call In-sync, which means you come back with your unit. There are also out-of-sync ICT where you come back as a small group or alone to do some prep work, or become the RSM slaves, etc.</div>

They ususally pack their full-pack then carry an extra bag. Helmet hang on full-pack. I seldom see reservist carry duffel bag in.<br><br>If you have a car, even better, place those heavy items in your car first, when the bunk settle then carry in.<br><br>Haha, nope you are not going to bookout at 23:59. Usually on the last day, people move very fast (this is the time where NSMen is at the most efficient!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"> ).<br>The faster everything settle, can outprocess early. So it applies, if anyone do things very quickly and settle everything(i.e. return store,etc). Outprocess can be very early. If you drag, haha, I know some CO, who "dun lan" with the attitude of his men (drag and drag and drag) purposely delay until 10pm then outprocess.</div>

Leave the SBO and helmet in the car until they are required.<br>Dun worri about the 2359 thingy, it is standard in all SAF100.<br>By the way, ICT end on Sat doesn't mean go book oout at 1300, it depends on the out-pro activities (handover bunks, stores, armstoke).</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Looks like I'm a bit late with my reponse, but here's a perspective from an Arty reservist anyway. I finished my 13-year cycle back in '01.<br><br>Yes, it's prudent to report with wearing your fullpack (helmet, SBO) &amp; carrying a civilian bag (PT attire, personal equipment), though bring along an extra #4 set too (in lieu if booking out in a stinky uniform). FYI No need for a "standard pack" yet unless you have to do standby (in later ICTs); your unit will be issuing footpowder/kiwi/toiletpaper, T-loaning out ponchos/groundsheets/shoebrushes, &amp; also collecting money to finance a BN fund for mealboxes/F&amp;N syrup/makan for future CO functions, etc.<br><br>Dump your barang in your car boot, or tompang with someone's on arrival. Much depends on which group you're reporting with, &amp; I think this relates to the "phase date" you're referring to; we didn't have such phrases in my time. FYI My unit was split into 3, of which 2 groups come in either 4-7 days earlier (key personnel, S1 cell, etc. to prepare everything) or 3-5 days earlier (mostly technical people to attend refresher classes/training &amp; sit for tests). There's no formal morning/last parades at this stage, hence some flexibility with booking in-out (with officers' tacit permission, natch).<br><br>The last group is the main body itself, &amp; you won't necessarily get a bunk immediately if you report with them. That's cuz the 1st day is usually busy with administrative &amp; logistical stuff. So even as the various reservist i/c's scutter about taking over stores/rooms/vehicles/etc., the rest of you are liable to hang out in the canteen - all day!<br><br>The process will become more efficient, though. By my 6th-8th ICT, everyone knew their jobs so well that we cut down the preparatory logistics to just 2 periods (10am-12noon) &amp; the main body could move out for field training in the afternoon &amp; run an IPPT in the evening! Better yet, most everyone would've built an informal contact network with the "early arrivals" after a couple of ICTs, to learn what the training programme is (esp. IPPT schedules!) &amp; what to prepare for/when to bring in our barang. That must've contributed to cutting down our "high key" ICTS from 21+ days to around 14 as any.<br><br>My unit always made it a point to allow book-outs on the 1st day - even during a very-tightly finetuned ICT schedule - as a nod for everyone to bring in last-minute stuff that was needed. As for discipline, the other camp people (inc. RSMs) will usually leave the reservists alone &amp;, remember, your unit RSM has his own operational duties too (i/c of the regimental police) to stereotypically boss people around.<br><br>There's no need to march point-to-point but, of course, long/dyed hair &amp; wearing slippers (usually during 6am drawing of rifles) can get your asses chewed off.<br><br>If anyone's to pull rank, it's usually the respective junior officers &amp; junior sergeant majors - but more to set a tone (if it was SAF regulars who took charge during the NSF days) &amp; to ensure everyone respect the hierarchy (you'll probably befriend them enough by the 3rd ICT to call them by appointment rather than "sir"). IMHO It's very much a citizen army in the reserves, with a high level of cooperation &amp; a can-do spirit.</div>

All it takes is just a 3hrs of your time to make $200/$400. Just call or go online to book a IPPT slot at your nearest IPPT location. Just give yourself a month to train once a week running and stretching... you should at least get a silver.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Best wishes, Rotary79, from a fellow "gunner".<br><br>BTW You won't be seeing the unit RSM as yet, except for muster parades. I know this, cuz I served with the BN Recce &amp; Survey group &amp; the RSM people usually follow us in field training.<br><br>I believe your base is Khatib Camp; it was either that or Amoy Quee Camp during my time. Arty reservists usually chope 4 areas there - the garage side, the canteen, &amp; the bunks or (when no bunks) the stadium grandstand seats. The officers &amp;, when permitted, the NCOs get to enjoy the air con in their respective messes, of course.<br><br>"Argh" (befriend) with your assigned group; you guys can "take cover" together as long as whoever's the i/c is contactable by whoever's higher in the "other rank" chain of command - that's NSmen for you! [Some of us were sneaking out of camp for lunch during the downtime, like maintainence days].<br><br>Stay away from the School of Arty side, &amp; note too if they're concurrently conducting a OCS course - the camp is usually more "on the ball" if they do.<br><br>BTW You can use the swimming pool - true! ~lol~</div>
