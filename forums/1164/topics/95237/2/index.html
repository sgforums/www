            <div class='col-md body'>The best scenario would that we will never fire a shot in anger against each other.While the regular discussions of SAF being able to over run KL in two days often spice up many a admin time between recruits and their CSMs, the reality is much harsher.We have not fought a war.Our Plans are good, but our Ops have not been tested.The same goes for Malaysia, they have not fought conventional wars too.Any conflict here would be a mire.<br><br>Better that we pool together, we using Malaysia's knowledge in jungle warfare and the former using us as a bootstrap because of our superior network-centric Army and our usage of precision military technology to ensure that the Malacca Straits and the surrounding land be forever a free and international zone.Be wary of China.She is not what she might seem.There is a chance that we might have to sail in arms to protect the South China Sea from aggresive PRC naval incursions.Think this sounds far-fetched, look at the PRC regime, their hawkish attitudes, China's increasing dependancy on oil, her links with Myanmar that wil only last until ASEAN and the EU manage to "re-programme" her.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Tactically, Singapore is actually acting as a buffer state between indonesia and mainland Malaysia. Indonesia is more of a threat to Malaysia and Singapore. From what I gather , even the Malaysians don't like the indonesians for some reason. Singapore in history have been part of Malaya and not forgetting some Singaporeans still have ties to Malaysia through relations, hence I rather stick with a country who has a soft spot for us.  And besides rupiah is too unsteady ...so I don't think Malaysia would want indonesia knocking at the door if Singapore falls. Think of confrontation times under sukarno- it wasn't pretty with the indonesians making trouble.<br><br>Singapore and Malaysia , I notice , always squabble like  small brother and big brother . If u look at Denmark and Sweden , same thing...with the "my horse is bigger than ur horse" attitude. Ultimately Singapore needs Malaysia and Malaysia needs Singapore in order to be buffered from indonesia ,like Denmark require Sweden and the other scandinavian countries to be buffered from russia (or the former USSR). They still view Russia as a threat.<br><br>Just my two cents from a civilian point of view</div>

He started to criticised Tim Huxley's Defending the Lion City with so many holes that a truck can go thru! <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br>First thing the book was first published in 2000, thus Huxely based his analysis on the orbat of SG &amp; MY before then.<br><br>So this stupi fool critcised Huxley based on non existence equipment before 2000!!! <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br>For example on MY's AD, they dun even have a modern AD radar then only recently ordered some, in fact they also dun have have any Jernas &amp; Igla ADS too!!!  Even now , Jernas will only start delivery after 2005.<br><br>So their AD was so poor in 2000 that they only have VSHORADs Starburst and gun arty!!!!<br><br>Now let's talk abt their armour &amp; anti armour capability, back in 2000, they only 26 Scorpion light tanks, and 184 Sibmas 6x6, 459 Condor 4x4 &amp; maybe 110 KIFV.<br><br>So at that time they have a total of 210 light tanks/tank destroyer and 569 APC/IFV.<br><br>Compare that to SG's 372 light tanks(AMX13, AMX10PAC90), more than 1600 ( M113 Ultra, Bionix, V-150/200, AMX-10ICV) and lastly 100+ MBTs.<br><br>In fact the scenario still remain the same, their PT-91 and Nurol ACV300 is yet to start delivery.<br><br>So with all this facts, who is the fool?!? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from"></div><div class="quote_body">The Singapore mind, to place the Malaysian forces in the same category as the Arabs is an under estimation.</div></blockquote>No, it is an OVER estimation.   Many Arab nations had been involved in conflicts and wars for a long time andat least they have combat experience.   Even though some Malaysian forummers had CLAIMED that MAF have combat experience, which war or conflict did the expereience come from?   Somalia and Confrontasi?   Ha..ha..ha...   I will go into that more later.<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from"></div><div class="quote_body">Most Malaysian servicemen have been blooded.</div></blockquote>Blooded from which conflict/war?   More likely blood coming from scraped hands and knees during the 40km march.   However, more on that later.<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from"></div><div class="quote_body">Malaysians are known in the business as "whispering death." </div></blockquote>More likely, moaning when about to die.<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from"></div><div class="quote_body">Malaysian troops are the only forces in the world to have defeated a communist insurgency.</div></blockquote>The British forces formed the bulk of resources in the insurgency and the SAS were the most effectively employed troops then.   The forces were also led by a British commander.   Therefore the above statement is BOOLSHEET!<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from"></div><div class="quote_body">The Malaysians persevered, rescuing the Rangers at the cost of one Malaysian killed, 9 wounded and losing 4 IFVs. Seventy, so called elite American forces did not litter the streets of Mogadishu with their bodies because of the sacrifices made by the Malaysians.<br></div></blockquote>The originator of the quote is humble.   He had not claimed credit for MAF's contribution in the recent Iraq War.   In fact, if not for MAF, the Americans, British and Australian would not have won.   What is not publicly acknowledged was that the entire MAF dressed as American soldiers and drove the M1s in the drive into Iraq.   The Americans only entered Iraq when MAF had defeated all opposition.   The MAF then returned the American uniforms and M1s to the rightful owners before quietly departing leaving the credit for the Americans!<br><br>Oh incidentally, that's how the originator's claims that the "Most Malysian servicemen have been blooded" claim can be explained.<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from"></div><div class="quote_body">Malaysians have trained year in year out to march in full combat gear over 40 kms in under 10 hours and construct fire trenches with overhead protection within 8 hours.</div></blockquote>Let them march for 10 hours and get to the combat zone exhausted.   We will use our Bionix and other transport to deliver our troops fresh.<br><br>How nice.   Even trained them to dig their own graves.   All we need to do is to cover up the graves.   Incidentally, 8 hours is nothing to boast about is it?<br></div>

War is a drain on a country's resources and attacking SE Asia would not be viable to China. Why occupy when u can make a vessel state out of Singapore and make Singapore pay tributes. ( Malacca historical example).  China is more focused on economic expansion and if she wants to expand her territory , Japan and Taiwan would be her immediate focus...China could just walk over and put her people there rather than relocate alot of mainland chinese to SE Asia. Furthermore China also have to protect her borders from Russia and India ...so like I said ...not viable. She would rather absorb territories nearby (look at tibet and inner mongolia).<br><br></div>
