            <div class='col-md body'>Firstly, Singaporean Main Battle Tanks travelling along our highways? Which Main Battle Tanks? Singapore has none. Unless you consider their 120 1960s Centurion tanks<br><br><span style="color: red;">all i can say is 120 centurion tanks and 350 AMX-13 Light tank are still better then someone who only have 26 scorpion light tanks</span><br><br>or their 350 AMX 13 light tanks a challenge for Malaysia's Polish MBTs.<br><br><span style="color: blue;">Malaysian polish MBT??? where har? OH..... in POLAND!! wait... are they sure they are really getting those tanks? how come so long liow.. no hear when delivery date is har? not even an estimation!! ahahhahaahaha.....until then... i think they have to rely on their 26 scorpion</span> <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br><br>MBTs obviously would not travel along highways due to their weight which would no be supported and the speed restrictions of track bound vehicles, unless of course you load them on tank transporters, of which again Singapore has a meagre number of.<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"> <span style="color: blue;">hahahahahaaha...... this is rich joke <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">  MBT would not travel along highways due to thier weight which would not be supported??? hahahahahahahahahahaahhahaaa.... but then the same road can support the weight of a MBT ontop of a tank transporter??? </span><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"> <span style="color: blue;">either  this guy must be a failure in physics and maths OR their tank transporter got anti-gravity power!! </span><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br><br><span style="color: blue;">speed restriction of track bound vehicles?? what he talking har? wheel vehicle got no speed restriction? </span><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br>Huxley can throw in the Primus and the Bionix for all he cares, but i doubt these will make a decisive change in the outcome of a land battle fought in the oil palm estates of Labis.<br><br><span style="color: blue;">waaa.... hahahahahahaa........ i didnt know that malaysian OIL PALM estate is so power that they can negate the firepower of our PRIMUS and BIONIX by a mere stroke of a pen! </span> <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br>A torrent of armoured vehicles? The US's 6,000 MBTs are a torrent. Russia's 40,000 MBT's are a torrent. Heck, even Israel's 1,ooo plus can be considered more than a fart. The Singaporean torrent? Of what? M113's?<br><br><span style="color: blue;">no lah.... i prefer the torrents of LSV and SPIDER armed with SPIKE, SAM, AGL40, 0.5calHMG and dozens of other deadly stuffs.</span><br><br>Striking the KL Tower and the Petronas Twin Tower you say? Obviously Mr. Huxley has forgotten that KL lies over 400 Km away from the nearest Singaporean military installation,<br><br><span style="color: blue;">400km not very far at all....  a mere 10 hour trip on a vehicle at 40km/hr or 5 hour trip on a vehicle at 80km/hr.</span><br><br><span style="color: red;">singaporeans driving along the NS highway has been known to drive at nearly twice that speed, reaching KL in under 3 hours!! and now, how fast does an F-16 falcon travel?<br><br>even at subsonic speed... an F-16 speed is 1080km/hr... a distance of 400km would take only 22 minutes! at supersonic... of mach 2 it will take only 10 minutes for an F-16 with FAE to reach KL! while it takes more then 20 minutes for all people to evacuate the petronas tower!!</span> <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_twisted.gif" alt="Twisted Evil" title="Twisted Evil"><br><br>whereas Singapore itself, which is ever denser than KL and not to mention other Malaysian towns is easily within reach of Malaysian artillery and MLRS Astros. You bomb the towers or the tower and we turn your cities into a sea of red kiasu blood.<br><br><span style="color: blue;">sorry chap... but we got more artillery then malaysia... and we got ICM aka metal rain....  our arty outrange yours... and your astros wont even survive our airstrike!</span><br><br>Taking out the national power grid. I'd love to understand how Singapore's 56 F-16s and soon to be mothballed A4s (of which Malaysia chose to dump 88 of many years ago) can wreak havoc all over Malaysia.<br><br><span style="color: blue;">Airstrike...... enuff said....</span><br><br>I am also interested to know how Mr. Huxley would like to explain the Singaporeans annihilating the 3rd Division in Johor. Perhaps they have employed some of Tom Clancy and Dale Hardy's wonderful wondrous weapons that were featured in "The bear and the dragon" and their other fantasy adventures of American military might.<br><br><span style="color: blue;">I got an idea..... since malaysia has been so kind to place alot of the major military camp in JOHOR.... we could FAE all those camps within afew minutes flight from singapore.</span><br><br>Next, our FA/18s in Butterworth, over 800kms away from the nearest Singaporean airbase will somehow be lined up at dawn on the runways,<br>waiting for Singaporean bombs to fall on them and turn them into twisting burning hulks hulks of burnt metal.<br><br><span style="color: blue;">distance is never a protection in present days, and even if you could launch those hornets before our falcons can reach butterworth, those hornets with sparrows are mere flying coffins when pit against our falcons with AMRAAM.</span><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br><br>Sure, our radar operators would be asleep by then, all over the country and those pesky Singaporeans have no doubt been able to turn their F-16s into stealth platforms, perhaps stealing some of those nice coatings from their Lafayette class ships.<br><br><span style="color: blue;">no lah stupid.... the F-16 can use NOE since malaysia got no AWAC and what is so great about a mere 8 hornet?? only 8 leh... you think 800 har?</span><br><br>Ditto too for our MIG-29s in Kuantan, all lined up and waiting for Mr. Kiasu to bomb the living day lights out of them at 6 in the morning.<br><br><span style="color: blue;">Kuantan not very far... i think an F-16 on mach 2 should be able to reach kuantan in 7.3 minutes... and if the falcon goes on NOE for the first 100km... heheheehehee.... bye bye fulcrum..... </span><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br><br>What of our anti aircraft forces? Those blokes manning the Jenas, IGLAs, Starbursts etc. Sleeping perhaps,<br><br><span style="color: blue;">no lah.... they very alert.. but those missiles are SHORADS and VSHORADs... they also suffer from altitude limitation as well as range limitations.... against our falcons... they wont even have a chance to shoot.... </span><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br><br>after all Mr. Huxley is of the impression that 120,000 Malaysian men in the military spend their days and nights sleeping away and limbo rocking at the nearest dangdut hangouts.<br><br><span style="color: blue;">120,000?? then east malaysia and north peninsula malaysia plus the thoudsands of miles of coast will be left undefended lor....hahahaha  </span><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br><br><span style="color: red;">i cut out the stupid joke....  </span><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br><br>Huxley's believe that Singapore's conscripted reservists, many of whom have no battle experience and Singapore's virtually zero history of warfare experience will somehow rise to the occasion and conquer the southern portion of a country that is 6 times it size in population count is a joke.<br><br><span style="color: blue;">sorry.... the entire peninsula malaysia population is not even 5 times the population of singapore... so how could the southern portion of peninsula malaysia have 6 times more population then singapore? cant count har?</span>  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br><br>Truly, a kiasu sick whiteman, who wants nothing but to sell some tree bark down south.<br><br><span style="color: blue;">well... at least someone also bought the tree bark up north...  </span><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by RussianPower:</div><div class="quote_body">Huxley should write about the malaysian armed forces then.</div></blockquote>To be honest, nothing interesting to write about unless he want to write some sarcasm! <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br>For example in the early 80's , MY decided to build up a mechanized forces( after more than 10 years since we have our mechannized forces), so they ordered &amp; bought Sibmas 6x6 wheeled &amp; Condor 4x4 wheeled APC for the main mechanized forces and a small amount of Scorpion and Stomer for recon role in the same time frame.<br><br>The Scorpion and Stomer are ok but the Sibmas &amp; Condor were bad buys, the reason is that both veh are wheeled which has a very high ground pressure which will be easily mired in our tropical rain forest. In fact, the Condor was so bad that it was reported that it could only operate in limited way by MAF!!!! <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br>Now the next bad buy, the A-4. They bought 88 2nd hand upgraded A-4 from the US surplus stock and delivery started in 1985.<br><br>This was heavily critcised by some military analyst as a bad buy becos it was considered to have a limited useful lifespan for the A-4 .<br><br>Three years after the deliveries the A-4, TUDM anounced in 1989 that they were going to withdraw from service and replaced by British Aerospace Hawk Mk 298s in late 1994 with less than 9 years of svc. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br>In fact , some of the upgraded A-4 after delivered were never sent back to MY but stored in US and were later scrapped !!!! <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br>Next bad decision is of course the zoo collection of TUDM, Mig29, 8 F/A-18 &amp; Hawks that were bought at the same time.<br><br>This was also heavily critcised by some military analyst becos of the small number of three type of a/c which created such a logistic nightmares for TUDM which in fact most of Mig-29 were grounded due to spares shortage in the first few years of svc.<br><br>Even now , the Mig 29 is still have bad availability record becos of the short lifespan of the russian engines.<br><br>Now they are adding more a/c type into the force namely SU-30 and the return of F-5, that means they will be operating five type of fighters b4 the end of the decade, the zoo is expanding !!!! <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br>Next is of course the Condor replacement, they bought 110 KIFV from South Korean for UN operation. Then they bought 211 Nurol ACV-300 from Turkey.<br><br>Both KIFV &amp; ACV-300 are variant of UDLP(formerly FMC) AIFV, upgraded variant of M113. They look the same but both type are using different powerpack. the ACV-300 uses US powerpack whereas the KIFV uses German powerpack!! Another logistics nightmare!!!!<br><br>Next is the MBT selection, two of the shortlisted were the Ukraine T-84 and the Polish PT-91.<br><br>Among the two, T-84 is of course a better MBT, T-84 is the upgraded T-80UD of USSR, the PT-91 is upgraded "Monkey" model T-72M1.<br>( They are called monkey model( export model) becos of poorer armour as compare to the Russia's own T-72 variant)<br><br>The T-84 is of better armour protection as well as with the latest K-5 ERA whereas the PT-91 is of poorer armour as well as the older ERAWA-1 ERA.<br><br>In fact, MY has actually chosen the T-84 over the PT-91 but eventually called off becos the Ukraine do not accept palm oil as payment!!!! <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br>So if Huxley were to write about the malaysian armed forces, it would be with many sarcastic remarks than praises!!! <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br></div>
