            <div class='col-md body'>Actually, the book by Tim Huxley on the SAF is only one book of a series. There are other books on other armed forces of the asia-pacific region by the same publisher. I have some of them. (Singapore, Indonesia, China)<br>The one I'm waiting for is the book on the Malaysian Armed Forces. The authors will be Joon-Num Mak and Russ Swinnertion - NOT Tim Huxley.<br>Its been several years and still no sign of that book being publish. Other books I'm waiting for are Thailand, Vietnam, Taiwan and Australia.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>This book was listed as one of the recommended readings in the SAF Professional Reading Programme. The book review was written by Chan Kay Min and here is part of it:<br><br>-------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br><strong>THE leaders of the Singapore Armed Forces bureaucrats or warriors? </strong> This is one poser raised by British political science academic Tim Huxley in Defending The Lion City -- The Armed Forces of Singapore.<br><br>The author doubts the effectiveness of SAF in time of war, being led by regular officers, many of whom, he says, are essentially bureaucrats. <strong>Huxley is also unsure of the motivation and quality of conscripts and national servicemen should they face a professional, albeit less well-equipped and less well-educated, adversary.</strong><br><br>In his conclusion, Huxley warns against Singapore's overconfidence when comparing itself with its neighbours. "Singapore's defence planners need to beware of falling into the trap of overestimating their own armed forces' potential performance and under-estimating the capabilities of likely adversaries."<br><br>While Singapore has technological advantage over its neighbours, it is of less use in situations of protracted political or military provocation serious enough to trigger mobilisation but insufficient to justify deployment of forces.<br>------------------------------------------------------------------------<br><br>It is important for us to recognise our weakness while we work on our strength.

            <div class='col-md body'>While us Singaporeans and the Malaysians are bickering about each other's military capabilities and prowess... we got to watch out for our neighbours to the South.<br><br>Not that many decades ago, we faced the CONFRONTASI together. There are elements in our southern neighbour's armed forces/ government that still barbour this kind of political and territorial ambition. So long as Singapore and Malaysia achieve higher levels of prosperity compared to the south, there will always be this threat. Watch out.... they have many hundreds of thousands of troops to throw into a fight, plus many other ways to create a social problem (e.g. pushing refugees from their many troubled provinces to the shores of M'sia and S'pore).<br><br>Further to the south lies Australia. Not a direct threat as such, but a significant geo-political player. Australia has become very sensitive after 9-11 and after the Bali bombing. They may not hesitate to intervene in our region. While this is not a threat to S'pore/M'sia, it could de-stabilise the region by isolating the Islamic elements. Again, this could evolve into a military threat.</div>
