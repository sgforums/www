Some problems with loading in FF]<br><br>This is the cockpit video of an incident where 2 american aircrafts fired upon a british convoy, killing 1 and injuring 4  british troops in Iraq.<br>Some BG: It was agreed amongst coalition forces that friendlies should have Orange panels on top of their vehicles. They pilots seemed to know that. I think the pilots also radioed in the wrong location. Hence, the Forward Air controller said there were no friendlies in the area. I think - need to listen again.<br><br>An interesting point, the US has failed, beyond releasing this video to the British MOD, to allow the pilots involved to be identified and to attend inquiries.<br><br>IMO, the pilots should be identified and charged. They very clearly knew what orange panels were for, but, upon being told there were no friendlies in the area, neglected to confirm their targets. Thery were therefore either very badly trained (in vehicle recognition) or very negligent.<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_evil.gif" alt="Evil or Very Mad" title="Evil or Very Mad"><br><br>Sigh...<br><br>RIP Lance Corporal of Horse Matty Hull.</div>

Yes they did or were supposed to know. They use of Orange panels arose to prevent a repeat of FF incidents in Gulf war I. Their comms suggest that they did. Plus, another agreed SOP is to pop a particular colour smoke when engaged by Friendlies. Notice the pilot remarked that smoke had been popped and then they knew what happened. That means they were briefed on the SOPs.<br><br>2. I agree. They seemed confused about where they were. AS I said, either undertrained, or negligent.  They asked for confirmation but that is pointless unless they specified the area they were in precisely.<br><br>4. I am very sure there were no USMC controller embedded with british troops.<br><br>5. As I said, either undertrained or negligent.<br><br>What ppl have to realize is this isn't a case of arty firing on a location upon being given info by an arty observor. They had visual on the target, and their job is to confirm their targets before firing, regardless of what others say. They very clearly knew something was wrong as evidenced by the number of times they mentioned the orange panels. The other guy even queried the identification of the panels as rockets ("Orange Rockets?").<br><br>----<br><br>1. I do not know anything about this.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Now I am not saying these fools are guilty. I am saying there should not be a cover up by the USAF about this. They say this is classified FFS! Have some sense of responsiblity man! One of your allies died here!<br><br>The pilots should however be broought to the stand and be judged by their peers. They should also have been ordered to attend the british inquiry.<br><br>The video imo clearly shows doubt in their minds. They had eyes-on but decided instead to rely on what an FAC who can't see what is happening to extinguish their doubts. That imo is unprofessional. Enough to be negligent? Nobody knows do they because of the cover up.</div>

What really riles me is that this nonsense has happened before in GW1, at least!<br><br>I too am puzzled as to how they could mistake a scimitar for a Zil. And as to why they seemed so eager to extinguish their doubts. Looking at the transcript they clearly have doubt in their minds - witness eg the constant querying of the orange panels.<br><br>This was imo avoidable and therefore cannot be filed away as an accident. In fact, some of the british soldiers even said they could see the pilot's faces!!!<br><br>Overtired, undertrained, over-eager or what?<br><br>More than that the US is refusing to cooperate with the BRitish inquiry. That, to me, is just wrong. If one of my relatives/kin/men died here and this is the American response, I really would be very very pissed.<br><br>Btw, I do feel sorry for the pilots as well though. You can hear their remorse when they realized their balls up.<br><br></div>

No it was not with that convoy that got attacked.</div></blockquote>Yah...there was probably someone to liaise with the US troops.<br><br>Actually, the thread on MIlitaryphotos make for a very good read. Some have suggested that the Pilots' poor comms procedure caused the FAC to be confused.<br><br><blockquote><br>the first few lines of dialogue indicate they were in the process of engaging targets before the video clip begins. The pilots are initially referring to "vehicles in reverts" which I assume to be slang for revetments (which implies the vehicles are in stationary, built up positions) 800 meters to the north of the previous artillery impact points. 35 calls to adjust artillery fires on these targets.<br><br>At the same time 35 is trying to adjust artillery, 36 spots a convoy of vehicles headed towards a village. A time critical target of opportunity; if they are to engage, they need to before the convoy reaches the village and before they reach BINGO fuel. He asks about friendlies in the area because he does indeed spot orange ID panels on the vehicles.<br><br>35 Repeats the query about friendlies, adding "this far north", as he confirms the artillery shift. He has apparently not yet spotted the convoy 36 is referring to (as indicated by confusion later in the dialogue).<br><br>The FAC apparently believes 35 is asking about friendlies in the area he's shifting the artillery to (the vehicles in revetments) and says they are well clear of friendlies.<br><br>Then...<br>- 36 spends a few minutes trying to show 35 where the convoy is.<br><br>- After a few minutes (no clear indication 35 was able to find the convoy) 35's attention seems to shift back to the vehicles in revetments and the artillery. He's talking to the FAC about where that artillery is....<br><br>- 36, whose attention is still on the convoy, tells 35 to raise his right wing (banking the aircraft so he can see the convoy)<br><br>- 35 gets angry, says he knows, and goes back to talking to the FAC<br><br>- 36 says they have orange rockets on them<br><br>- 35 tries to take a look<br><br>- 35 starts talking about fuel<br><br>- 36 wants to kill them before they reach town<br><br>-The FAC asks if they can go crimson (which I assume means in hot) but does he know what they're going after?<br><br>I ask, because AFTER the two passes, the FAC says...<br><br>Quote:<br>1343.13 MANILA HOTEL:<br><br>POPOV 36 from MANILA HOTEL, guns . . .<br><br>1343.17 MANILA HOTEL:<br><br>To engage those targets in the revetts (slopes).<br><br>Why is the FAC still talking about the targets in revetments?<br><br>Can the FAC hear the inter-cockpit communication between the pilots? If not, then if you look at the dialogue, the last thing the FAC knew was the pilots were talking about engaging vehicles in revetments -- which includes the time they were asking about friendlies. Which also indicates that when the FAC asked if they could go crimson, he was referring to the vehicles in revetments, whereas the pilots understood it to mean against the convoy.</blockquote></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I agree wrt to poor comms procedures.  Viewing the transcript alone, I wouldn't have any idea if the pilots were communicating to the FAC or chatting among themselves.<br><br>However, I do not believe that when MANILA HOTEL said, "can you switch to CRIMSON", was there any permission for POPOV34 to roll in hot. Nor was there expressed permission for POPOV34 to engage the orange rockets.<br><br>It did seem to me though that during 1341:32 to 1343:13, MANILA HOTEL had surprisingly little communication with POPOV34.  It also seems to me that POPOV34 largely ignored MANILA HOTEL during that time period of 2 minutes while they carried out the attack.<br><br>It might just be possible that the 2 pilots hard shut out MANILA HOTEL on purpose while they engaged the Orange Rockets.<br><br>SpecOp87, given how ridiculous Orange Rockets may sound, a Union Jack may not have helped.<br><br>"Look those Iraqis are waving a British flag!
