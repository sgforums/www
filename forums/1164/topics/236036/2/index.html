Clear day, doubt, and they attack = fools.<br><br>If in doubt dun fire or wait for FAC to get eyes on!<br><br>Can't believe at least one of the fools got a promotion, got medals, is a 'hero' and is teaching other people to fly.<br><br>Well, Perhaps this is down to cultural differences 'hero' is defined differently in America.<br><br>American Hero:<br><img src="http://img.dailymail.co.uk//i/pix/2007/02_1/TopGunDM0802_228x362.jpg"><br><br>REAL hero: Trooper Chris Finney, The Blues and Royals<br>George Cross<br><img src="http://newsimg.bbc.co.uk/media/images/39512000/jpg/_39512955_finney2203.jpg"><br><br><blockquote> George Cross Citation:<br><br>Trooper Finney, a young armoured vehicle driver with less than a year's service, was driving the leading Scimitar vehicle of his troop, which had been at the forefront of action against enemy armour for several hours. In the early afternoon, the two leading vehicles paused beside a levee to allow the troop leader to assess fully the situation in front. Without warning, they were engaged by a pair of Coalition Forces ground attack aircraft. Both vehicles were hit and caught fire, and ammunition began exploding inside the turrets. Trooper Finney managed to get out of his driving position and was on the way towards cover when he noticed that his vehicle's gunner was trapped in the turret. He then climbed onto the fiercely burning vehicle, at the same time placing himself at risk from enemy fire, as well as fire from the aircraft should they return. Despite the smoke and flames and exploding ammunition, he managed to haul out the injured gunner, get him off the vehicle, and move him to a safer position not far away, where he bandaged his wounds.<br><br>The troop officer, in the other Scimitar, had been wounded and there were no senior ranks to take control. Despite his relative inexperience, the shock of the attack and the all-too-obvious risk to himself, Trooper Finney recognised the need to inform his headquarters of the situation. He therefore broke cover, returned to his vehicle which was still burning, and calmly and concisely sent a lucid situation report by radio. He then returned to the injured gunner and began helping him towards a Spartan vehicle of the Royal Engineers which had moved forward to assist.<br><br>At this point, Trooper Finney noticed that both the aircraft were lining up for a second attack. Notwithstanding the impending danger, he continued to help his injured comrade towards the safety of the Spartan vehicle. Both aircraft fired their cannon and Trooper Finney was wounded in the buttocks and legs, and the gunner in the head. Despite his wounds, Trooper Finney succeeded in getting the gunner to the waiting Spartan. Then, seeing that the driver of the second Scimitar was still in the burning vehicle, Trooper Finney determined to rescue him as well. Despite his wounds and the continuing danger from exploding ammunition, he valiantly attempted to climb up onto the vehicle, but was beaten back by the combination of heat, smoke and exploding ammunition. He collapsed exhausted a short distance from the vehicle, and was recovered by the crew of the Royal Engineers' Spartan.<br><br>During these attacks and their horrifying aftermath, Trooper Finney displayed clear-headed courage and devotion to his comrades which was out of all proportion to his age and experience. Acting with complete disregard for his own safety even when wounded, his bravery was of the highest order throughout.</blockquote></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I don't believe the FACs mentioned were Aerial FACs.  If they were, they wouldn't need POPOV35 to help shift the arty guns.<br><br>They were probably attached ground Forward Air Controllers.   Which means, other than the primary area they are assigned to, they would have limited situational awareness on anything else.<br><br>And in any case, its perfectly normal human mentality to "See what they believe."   Can't blame the pilots for being humans right? If they had some mavericks on board, they could have gotten a better look at what they were attacking.<br><br>Then again, the A-10s that attacked the US Marines, had mavericks too and even used them to kill a couple of USMC AAVs.</div>
