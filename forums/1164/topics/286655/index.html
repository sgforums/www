            <div class='col-md body'>18/10/07 - News section<br><br>Military helicopter crew 'wrecked conservatory by flying down to ogle sunbathing au pair'<br>by EMILY ANDREWS<br><br>A military helicopter destroyed the conservatory of a Â£1.75 million mansion when its pilot swooped too low to look at a sunbathing au pair, a court heard yesterday.<br><br>The four servicemen flying the Merlin helicopter were said to have dropped to 500ft or lower for the "frolic" in July.<br><br>The house's owners claim the downdraught from the aircraft seriously damaged the 23ft-high glass conservatory, leaving it needing to be replaced.<br><br>Barry and Anna George, who own The Old Stables in Eastbourne, East Sussex, are claiming Â£250,000 in damages plus legal costs.<br><br>The Ministry of Defence denies all liability in the case.<br><br>Their barrister, Daniel Crowley, told a preliminary hearing at the High Court in London that the helicopter dropped to 500ft so the crew could "communicate" with the au pair.<br><br>He said the crew was not given permission to fly at under 1,000ft and that "their own regulations say they should not have been flying low over a built-up area of Eastbourne".<br><br>Mr Crowley claimed that when the MoD Merlin - which is 75ft long and weighs 14tons - flew over the mansion on the afternoon of July 23, 2004, the downdraught from its rotors damaged the conservatory's glass roof.<br><br>This left it leaking and, he said, "pretty much most of it" needed to be replaced.<br><br>Mr Crowley told the judge that Mr and Mrs George's home - which has two other houses attached - was valued at Â£1.75 million at the time of the incident.<br><br>Around 50 per cent of the roof of the property - which has a floor-space of 7,000 square feet - is made up of "steel and aluminium double glazed glass panels" and is highly visible from the air, Mr Crowley said.<br><br>He added that the conservatory had won an architectural prize in 2000.<br><br>The eight-day case, to start in February, is likely to generate hundreds of thousands of pounds in legal costs.<br><br>If the MoD loses the taxpayer will have to pick up the bill.<br><br>The judge, Jonathan Foster QC, described the incident as an "alleged frolic".<br><br>Conceding that suggesting the damage was caused as a result of a frolic gone wrong was a "serious allegation", Mr Crowley said he would seek to develop the point during cross-examination.<br><br>He said there was an issue as to whether "those piloting the aircraft were deliberately flying at a low height for fun".<br><br>"They have got this expensive equipment, it's fun to fly and, rather than just sit around, they want to fly it," Mr Crowley added.<br><br>But James Maxwell-Scott, for the MoD, insisted a 'helicopter flying at 500ft or above simply could not have caused the damage'.<br><br>He added that although, "technically", permission needed to be granted for flying the helicopter at under 1,000ft, a chart the pilot was using did not indicate that he needed it and that he 'felt he could fly down to 500ft'.<br><br>Central to the case is a piece of equipment on the Merlin which measures the height at which the helicopter is flying.<br><br>That was not working at the time.<br><br>Find this story at <a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/pages/live/articles/news/news.html?in_article_id=488401&amp;in_page_id=1770" rel="nofollow">http://www.dailymail.co.uk/pages/live/articles/news/news.html?in_article_id=488401&amp;in_page_id=1770</a><br>Â©2007 Associated New Media<br><br></div>
