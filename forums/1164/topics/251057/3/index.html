At least 10 years ago. And that sand bank is usually under water, but that time dry season.<br><br>It was at a secluded part of Upper Pierce Reservoir.<br><br>Even earlier 20 yrs ago at another part of Lower Pierce Reservoir I also found a ancient bullet. tHis time just a bullet itself, no cartridge.<br><br>It must've been unfired and somehow over time got detached from the cartridge cos it was not deformed at all, just very rusted.<br><br>It was quite long, close to 7.62 diameter and the head wasn't sharp like our SAF 5.56 or 7.62; but rather rounded.<br><br>Must be something even older than WW2.</div>
