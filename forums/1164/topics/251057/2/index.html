Even if we could have fought off Yamashita's first attack, I don't think the Japanese would have given up there and then.<br><br>And of course, the British didn't have any realistic way of fighting on for long to begin with... turning Singapore in Stalingrad certainly wasn't an option for them and they still had a fatal mismeasure of the Japanese soldier as not worth much in combat... factors that led to them being unable to fend off the Japanese effectively and ultimately leading their defeat.</div></blockquote>For us to even turn the city into Stalingrad requires constant resupply, which, we don't even have.<br><br>And in any case, the Japs could happily bomb and poison our reservoirs for all they cared.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>in the defence of gen percival.... i think he really had it bad from the higher command... as the brits did not provide as much as they could to hold singapore.<br><br>Of course these people are not even locals, just some foreign rulers and yet they stayed to try to fight.<br><br>If singapore was to be attacked, how many generals would stay to fight? Or would they run with all their bonus and increments?</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>this is a quote by general yamashita after the surrender:<br><br>"My attack on Singapore was a bluff - a bluff that worked. I had 30,000 men and was outnumbered by more than three to one. I knew if I had to fight long for Singapore, then I would be beaten. That was why the surrender had to be arranged at once. I was very frightened all the time that the British would discover our numerical weakness and lack of supplies and force me into disastrous street fighting. When the message came of the enemy surrender, I was very cautious, I was afraid it was a trick"<br><br>i guess brit intelligence sucked  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"></div>
