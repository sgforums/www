            <div class='col-md body'>I dunno about the rest, are we being a tad unfair to Percival? Defeat aside I believe some historians indicated that he actually had a pretty good idea of what the Japanese were going to do and what to do about it, but was brushed off by the British top brass and given what he had.<br><br>And of course Percival was already starting with dice loaded against him. He had no proper intelligence to fight the war with, his troops were not well trained or equipped, not to mention disorganized and the only thing he had was numbers... and of course Yamashita did manage to pull a fast one on him as well.<br><br>Was he really incompetent? I just know I won't want to be in his shoes if I had to prepare the defence of Singapore at that time working with his kind of higher ups.<br><br>The question does remain though... do our scholar generals know how to fight a war and make the proper decisions? We won't find out until the stuff hits the fan.</div>

            </div>
            <div class='col-md body'>A few extracts on this guy as well:<br><br><blockquote><br>Percival was made a full colonel and from 1936 to 1938 he was General Staff Officer Grade 1 in Malaya, the Chief of Staff to General Dobbie, the General Officer Commanding in Malaya. During this time, he recognised that Singapore was no longer an isolated fortress.[15] He considered the possibility of the Japanese landing in Thailand to "burgle Malaya by the backdoor[16] and conducted an appraisal of the possibility of an attack being launched on Singapore from the North, which was supplied to the War Office, and which Percival subsequently felt was similar to the plan followed by the Japanese in 1941.[17] He also supported Dobbie's unexecuted plan for the construction of fixed defences in Southern Johore. In March 1938, he returned to Britain and was promoted to brigadier on the General Staff, Aldershot Command.</blockquote>And of course, when the war started:<br><br><blockquote>Churchill viewed the fall of Singapore to be "the worst disaster and largest capitulation in British history." However, Britain's defence, the Middle East and the Soviet Union had all received higher priorities in the allocation of men and material, so the desired airforce strength of 300 to 500 aircraft was never reached; whereas the Japanese invaded with over two hundred tanks, the British Army in Malaya did not have a single one.[26]<br><br>In 1918, Percival had been described as "a slim, soft spoken manÂ… with a proven reputation for bravery and organisational powers"[27] but by 1945 this description had been turned on its head with even Percival's defenders describing him as "something of a damp squib".[28] The fall of Singapore switched Percival's reputation to that of an ineffective "staff wallah", lacking ruthlessness and aggression, even though few doubted that he was a brave and determined officer. Over six feet in height and lanky, with a clipped moustache and two protruding teeth, and decidedly unphotogenic, Percival was an easy target for a caricaturist, being described as "tall, bucktoothed and lightly built".[29] There was no doubt his presentation lacked impact as "his manner was low key and he was a poor public speaker with the cusp of a lisp".[30]</blockquote>Some of the stuff against him might be unfair, but he did make some mistakes:<br><br><blockquote>Percival was ultimately responsible for the men who served under him, and with other officers Â– notably Major-General David Murray-Lyon commander of the Indian 11th Infantry Division Â– he had shown a willingness to replace them when he felt their performance was not up to scratch. Perhaps his greatest mistake was to resist the building of fixed defences in either Johore or the north shore of Singapore, dismissing them in the face of repeated requests to start construction from his Chief Engineer, Brigadier Ivan Simson, with the comment "Defences are bad for morale Â— for both troops and civilians".[31] In doing so, Percival threw away the potential advantages he could have derived from the 6,000 engineers under his command and perhaps missed his best chance to blunt the danger posed by the Japanese tanks.<br><br>Percival also insisted on defending the north-eastern shore of Singapore most heavily, against the advice of the Allied supreme commander in South East Asia, General Archibald Wavell. Percival was perhaps fixed on his responsibilities for defending the Singapore Naval Base.[32] He also spread his forces thinly around the island and kept few units as a strategic reserve. When the Japanese attack came in the west, the Australian 22nd Brigade took the brunt of the assault.[33] Percival refused to reinforce them as he continued to believe that the main assault would occur in the north east.[34]</blockquote></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>It should be noted that Britain retained most of her hardware for defending the isle back in Europe, and I would like to stress that the disastrous war in France resulted in a sizable portion of the British expeditionary force without its weapons since they abandoned all their equipment at Dundirk.<br><br>Lots of Admirals were still skeptics of aircraft carriers back then so some didn't foresee the use of them. As for the British defending Malaya, it is safe to say that the British do not have the resources to defend it nor are the ANZ troops well equipped for defence. The British Empire did not have the resources to defend it and it is difficult to defend a huge coast line like Malaysia's.</div>

The trouble was that they didn't have the equipment to fight with. Quite frankly on the scale of things, we were considered expendable since the war with Germany was far more important. In any case, the British simply didn't have enough naval assets to defend all the way to SEA. It took the last year of the war before they felt secure enough to divert assets from the Mediterranean and Atlantic fleet to India based of Ceylon where they launched attacks against the Japanese and played cat and mouse with them. It was only at Midway and Coral Sea where the Japanese Navy suffered severe setbacks enough for them to actually commit to more serious operations. By the end of the war, the most advanced fleet asset the Duke of York served as flagship.<br><br>Seriously, nothing could be done. We were doomed to fall regardless.

If they were facing Soviet armour, they would be screwed. Zhukov mauled them when they tried to invade Siberia, so much so that the Japanese quietly negotiated a peace treaty and avoided attacking the Soviet Union during WWII. When the war came to a close, the Soviets invaded Manchuria and routed the Japanese pretty thoroughly. Given time, they would have invaded Hokaido too.</div>
