              <h1 class="storyheadline"><em>New coastal submarine concepts get ready to break the surface</em></h1>
              <p class="by">By Richard Scott,(JDW)</p>
              <p class="date">14 May 2008</p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">''</span>The modern non-nuclear submarine is acknowledged to be a highly
              potent sea denial and intelligence gathering asset and, in the right
              hands, a very challenging adversary for even the best-equipped
              anti-submarine warfare (ASW) forces.</p>
              <p>Even 26 years on, the UK Royal Navy's (RN's) experience in
              the 1982 Falklands (Malvinas) conflict serves as a salutary reminder of
              how difficult a prey the conventional submarine can be. Although it
              deployed a large taskforce equipped with a full range of ASW
              capabilities, it failed to detect the San Luis, the single Argentine
              Type 209 conventional submarine deployed in theatre. It is believed
              that only a faulty fire-control system prevented the submarine from
              executing a successful attack on an RN frigate operating close inshore.</p>
              <p>The US Office of Naval Intelligence points out: "Operating
              near busy shipping channels or maritime chokepoints, submarines can
              covertly lay minefields or attack and disrupt commercial shipping. In
              this way, even a nation having a few relatively unsophisticated
              submarines can conduct sea denial and exert regional influence.</p>
              <p>"Fitted with improved quieting sensors, weapons and
              propulsion systems readily available in today's market, submarines can
              operate undetected near a regional adversary's coast, covertly conduct
              surveillance, engage enemy naval forces and expand their nation's
              regional impact still further."</p>
              <p>Covertness brings another attribute. Operating unseen and
              unannounced, the submarine can be forward deployed without undue
              provocation, thereby avoiding crisis escalation or political
              embarrassment. It can also be employed to support the insertion and
              extraction of special forces in clandestine missions.</p>
              <p>And so for many smaller nations, the conventional submarine
              remains a prized asset because of the disproportionate impact it can
              have on military operations in the maritime domain, both above and
              below the waterline. Its major selling point is as a uniquely
              cost-effective means of sea denial against far more powerful potential
              adversaries.</p>
              <p>Over the last two decades, the conventional submarine market
              has been dominated by sales of boats in the 1,400-1,800-ton bracket,
              typified by German shipbuilder HDW's best-selling Type 209, the
              successor Type 214 and the rival Scorpene jointly produced by French
              naval shipbuilding, systems and support group DCNS and Spanish
              shipbuilder Navantia. Highly capable, and now increasingly adopting
              air-independent propulsion (AIP) technology to extend submerged
              endurance and reduce the indiscretion ratio, they afford a powerful and
              cost-effective deterrent capability.</p>
              <p>However, 'cost effective' does not mean cheap and it would
              be quite wrong to suggest that the acquisition of even a small number
              of diesel-electric submarines does not in itself constitute a
              significant capital investment. Furthermore, operating any submarine
              force in a safe and efficient manner demands the highest levels of
              design assurance, maintenance, operator and maintainer training and
              operational control.</p>
              <p>As a result, some smaller navies with more limited financial
              and technical resources - while attracted to the attributes of the
              submarine - have, to date, shied away from their acquisition. Others,
              particularly in Latin America, are troubled by the projected costings
              for the replacement of existing diesel-electric submarines now
              approaching life expiry.</p>
              <p>Acknowledging this fact, four of Europe's leading submarine
              design houses have now all sought to craft compact, highly automated
              'entry-level' submarine concepts specifically engineered to reduce
              capital cost and support overhead and manning requirements. As well as
              appealing to navies looking to acquire a submarine capability for the
              first time, the rival contractors are also eyeing nations that may be
              looking to recapitalise their existing submarine arms<span style="color: #ff0000;">.''</span></p>

              <p>When I read that the Republic of Singapore Navy had decommissioned
              the MGB squadron in a sunset ceremony at Changi Naval Base last Tuesday
              after over three decades of service, a part of me died a little.</p>
              <p>Though this was nothing compared to the death pangs I felt when they shut down Brani Naval Base in 2000.</p>
              <p>I had spent most of my full-time national service at Brani Medical
              Centre as a medical orderly who refused to wear a tunic because it
              didn't flatter my body type.</p>
              <p>What is now called HarbourFront is
              from where I used to make a daily commute by sea to Pulau Brani early
              in the morning before the Sentosa-bound holidaymakers arrived.</p>
              <p>One of the more bizarre and joked-about aspects of the supposedly
              high-security naval base was that you could see the Sentosa golf course
              across the water just 150m away from the wharf where the warships are
              alongside.</p>
              <p>So if you really wanted to, you could actually ding
              an MGB with a golf ball with a decently hit drive from Sentosa. I think
              that counts as a water hazard with a penalty of one stroke.</p>
              <p>Dinged or not, the MGBs were at the time the pride of the fleet, the most advanced vessels we had.</p>
              <p>But going on an exercise in one</p>
              <p>was like being in a teacup during a tsunami. You've never been seasick until you've been seasick onboard</p>
              <p>an MGB.</p>
              <p>As a medic, I would be attached to different ships for exercises. The
              plum attachments were, of course, the giant Landing Ship Tanks or LSTs
              which had survived World War II.</p>
              <p>Size does matter.</p>
              <p>Those
              old LSTs have since been replaced by sleeker models with a computerised
              bridge that resembles the Starship Enterprise (from Star Trek: The Next
              Generation, not the dinky original series).</p>
              <p>During my service,
              the MGBs themselves were already being edged out by the newer,
              sexier-sounding missile corvettes (you know, like the sports car) as
              the navy's most advanced vessels.</p>
              <p>But even the corvettes have
              now been outstripped by the recently commissioned stealth frigates in
              terms of technological doodads.</p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">And in a few years, the stealth
              frigate will be made to look like a sampan when the navy acquires an
              even more ridiculously advanced ship that can sail at warp speed or
              something.</span></p>
              <p>It's the circle of life - but with weaponised boats.</p>
              <p>All of us will be replaced eventually by someone younger and technologically better equipped.</p>
              <p>But when we're forcibly retired, it will be with the comforting
              knowledge that our replacements will also be replaced eventually by
              someone younger and with anti-submarine capability.</p>
              <p>So goodbye, RSS Sea Wolf, once a perennial Best Ship winner and Singapore's first missile gunboat.</p>
              <p>I hardly knew ya. I was too busy trying to keep from puking my guts out.</p>
