Our doctrine isnt on 'sit-duck' defence but defense through offensive ( all shld know ) , so if we specialise in urban warfare , we will get shitted in country X and Y while fighting in their jungles....<br><br>Of course we still have to major in urban warfare in case enemy manage to sneak in , and not forgeting our X and Y neighbours have cities too...</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Singapore is already considered to be 100% urban. Those little patches of "jungle" you see around are too small to count.<br><br>But of course, the reason why we train in jungle warfare is because we will not be fighting in Singapore unless a war goes very badly. In a conflict we will attack first and capture enough of the enemy's territory to at least create a buffer zone, if not destroy his warmaking ability completely. The war will be one where the enemy tries to retake his land from us.<br><br>Or at least, that is the plan.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>This is a very good question, and I think that is the main flaw in SAF doctrine. We have to have much more training in Urban warfare. jungle training is a total waste of time. People will tell you that the SAF will not fight in S'pore but will conduct offensive operations in a foreign country that has a lot of jungle. Therefore, we must train for jungle warfare. Well, I don' know any army that won a war by holding the jungle or plantations. The Vietcong fought the US Army for 10 years from the jungle, and were undisputed jungle warfare champions, but that got them nothing. Its only when they capture the major urban centres of Saigon, Hue, etc. that they won the war. Likewise, in order to win, the SAF has to capture and hold the ports, airports, main communicatiion centres, and capture the military and political leadership. Well, all these people and strcutures are not in the jungle. They are in BUAs. MINDEF better wake up their ideas and get with the program.    <blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by Parka:</div><div class="quote_body"> <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="Arrow" title="Arrow"> Heh.

Before you can even get to your favourite jungle my friend, you have to go thru JB. You know what they call JB? a BUA. U think you are going to bash thru JB with your jungle fighting skill?

Our region is pre-dominanted by jungle and forest , it is inevitable that battle will be drawn into the jungle as it is the best place for a defensive stand. U can clear the whole urban region of malaysia , with the jungle untouch , u wan them to play 'gorilla' <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"> on u?? Do u know how much an offensive stand a jungle can provide for the enemy...?<br><br>Take the Vietnam for example , y the US force will have to fight years in to jungle other than jus FIBUA in Hanoi???<br><br>If the SAF will to wake up the idea....... U wanna change the uniform from green to pink?</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>To moonstriker,<br><br>Actually, the area around the second link in not considered Jungle. That is just mangrove swampland. Jungle is something you get deeper into Johore or Pahang.<br><br>And as for jungle fighting, there is NO need for jungle fighting so near into Singapore. That bit of land is definately within art range. So you can bombard the hell out of anything coming from that location.<br><br>Its up to the strategy people to determine what we want to do if (a big if) we have to drive north. If we want to go all the way and deliver a knockout blow, then FIBUA training is more important. If we want to do a halfhearted foray into Johore and establish the Mersing Line, then jungle (or plantation) fighting is important.<br><br>For me, I don't believe any fight with the neightbour up north is a halfhearted affair. It will end up with an army in Perlis or in Sentosa. Any other way will not be able to settle the issue to their or our satisfaction.<br><br>And the MAF is definately mobile, especially with their huge numbers of civiliian vehicles. There is no way we are going to establish the mersing line without getting our rear areas penetrated.</div>
