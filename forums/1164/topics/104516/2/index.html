In other words they need a scapegoat or somebody in their intelligence community is gonna become one.<br><br>Furthermore with such a cunning spy nearly penetrated syrian defence ministry do you think you would dare to let him continue to run around freely <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"> more likey he would find out whats going on then run you around in circles and feed you wrong info instead.</div></blockquote>Well one would have to accept the political motivation for executing Cohen publicly, I suppose.  Then again, the Syrians were unprofessional vis-a-vis security from the word go - it only stands to reason that they would be hamfisted right to the end.<br><br>I'd agree that the counterespionage program would be beyond the capabilities of the Syrians at the time.  However, I suspect that the Israeli and British services could quite easily pull it off, keeping in mind that a lot of data collected in espionage is in the form of documents.  As long as care is taken to ensure that the data is credible, it should work.</div>
