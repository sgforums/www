            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote>Given that we have foreign intelligence agents spying on us,what is it that prohibits our counter-espionage departments from making them 'disappear' or liquidating these agents?</blockquote>Sometimes, it is good to let them know somethings but not all things, tell them report alittle about our light but not to reveal all light. Our MSD have their own way of doing and we should have faith in them. I wont be surprise if foreign intelligence is scanning world wide defense forums as intelligence gathering from non-human sources is in fact the most widely used form of gathering. So sometimes, we know their existence but it doesnt mean that we have to liquidate them. Their existence might be a blessing both for their owner and for us. Simply, we can also perform intelligence on them. We want to know how they sent encrypted msg, their code, their operation style. We prefer to break the den, not so much on subdueing the individuals. We might also want to know what they are here for, what they want and how they got to know what they want.<br><br>So all in all, their existence is there somewhere and something their pressence is felt, but it doesnt mean that we should pin them down immediately. Let them know CAT 5 secrets, trade it off with some intelligence and deterrents. However dun misunderstand my point. Unless it is not neccesary, we should crack them under certain crucial circumstances. As i had said, ISD and MSD have their way.<br><br><blockquote>Imagine an enemy spy sent back to their employer as a pile of ashes or as body parts.A strong message that you do not mess with Singapore.</blockquote>You talk as if it is so direct and simply. You must know the diplomatic consequences behind those actions. For example, we discovered chinese spys in Singapore. Are we to shoot them and destroy our relation or we have a little 'trading'..... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_twisted.gif" alt="Twisted Evil" title="Twisted Evil">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br><br><blockquote>Alternatively,perhaps Sg should set up a special section dedicated to counter-terrorism and counter-espionage black ops,where missions such as assassinating foreign ambassadors or liquidating traitors or enemy spies and other sensitive tasks would be handled</blockquote>.<br><br>There are.<br><br><blockquote>"...Slay one to scare a hundred.." - Anon</blockquote>No matter how much u slay, how many you scare, they will just keep coming.

            <div class='col-md body'>I'm not expert on spy issues, but I do know for a fact that China used to execute spies caught.  However, today they have changed that policy to long term imprisonment.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_neutral.gif" alt="Neutral" title="Neutral"><br>Why don't execute spies anymore?  Well, its just a job for the individual doing the spying.<br><br>Are there spies in S'pore?  Hell yah!  S'pore is know for its economy &amp; its situated in the middle of ASEAN coutnries.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br>Its not always about military intel that a spy is after, sometimes its about the policies of that coutry or trade secrets that are of interest.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"><br>There are overt spies that you can look up in S'pore, just go to any embassy &amp; you'll most likely spot them.  If you're desprate, go into the U.S embasst &amp; ask to speak to the CIA station chief.  For the Brits embassy, ask to speak to the foregin affairs officers( cover for MI-6 ).  Malaysian embassy also has its own overt spy officer in S'pore.  In fact, most embassies would have a embassy spy to either recruit local informals or update the embassador on local issues.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br>But before you decide to actually look up a spy in any embassy, please be informed that S'pore counter-spy agency would already be spotting you from across the road.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br><br>On the other hand, covert spies, would not be located in an embassy for their own personnal security as well as the security of their ops.   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br>Spies don't usually carry out assassination as this would blow off their cover &amp; put themselves at risk of being picked up by counter-spies who already know about them.  Usually assassinations are done by 'outsiders', who enter the country 2 weeks or 1 day before the hit &amp; then depart immediately after.  Sometimes the assassin could be a local thug hired to the job.<br><br>Hmm! Did you know S'pore has its own spies?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_twisted.gif" alt="Twisted Evil" title="Twisted Evil"><br>Anyway, I read that Indonesia recently started an International school for spies.  Why not enrol for a degreed or diplomma on spying. Hahaha... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>If you wish to spy for Singapore, contact ISD. They are very selective, and you will most likely not make it, but you can always try.<br><br>Why don't we kill off foreign spies? Many reasons. Firstly, it is against our own laws to do so. We have higher morals than that. Secondly, many foreign spies are embassy staff and have diplomatic immunity. It would be illegal to prosecute them -- we can only deport them and declare them persona non grata (PNG). Fourthly, it can be considered an act of war or aggression. Lastly, it makes things more dangerous for our own spies. There is a certain understanding between spy agencies.<br><br>Also, most foreign operatives here are "handlers" -- they control a network of Singaporeans (traitors) that actually provide the information. Examples would be SAF officers that hand over secret documents, cleaning personnel in bases that install and recover bugs, or restaurant staff who hear loose talk at their establishments. We can come down on the Singaporeans with the OSA and other laws, and definitely do. Very few foreign operatives actually go out and do anything outright illegal -- not easy, and no need when you can cultivate locals to do it for you. So what can you kill them for? Talking to a kopitiam uncle who overheard SAF personnel talking about this or that?</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Put up Eli Cohen here, the most successful israeli spy. With his charming good looks and the lavish parties he hosted and generousity with $$$ He made powerful friends in high places. It was also heavily rumoured that he had as many as 40 lovers many of whom were daughters, wives and mistresses of powerful people from whom he gathered his intel.<br><br>The entire text is too long, I have edited to shorten it.<br><br><img src="http://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/images/elicohen.gif"> Eli Cohen was first sent to Buenos Aires, Argentina, to establish his cover as a Syrian emigre. He soon established himself in the social and cultural life of the Syrian community of Buenos Aires and was known as a wealthy businessman who was generous, tipped well, and loved the night life. He soon became accepted, well-liked and respected, and made contacts with politicians, diplomats and military officials working out of the Syrian Embassy. One of them was Colonel Amin al-Hafaz, a supporter of the secular-leftist Ba'ath party.<br><br>Cohen's contacts, nurtured through a string of lavish dinner parties, social occasions, and friendships with those in high places, led to invitations to visit Damascus and to set up a business venture there. He was promised support in any venture he might wish to undertake, and the generous sums of cash which he appeared to possess appealed to the unscrupulous who thought he could provide "grease" to their financial ambitions, as well as patriotic Syrians who hoped for an infusion of foreign capital into the Syrian state.<br><br>Nine months later, in late 1961, Eli came back to Israel for a visit with his wife Nadia. But he spent most of his time in Tel Aviv "perfecting his cover and being briefed on Aman's requirements of him in Syria, as well as last-minute intelligence data needed for his mission." Needless to say, his success in effectively penetrating the Syrian social and political/diplomatic/military strata already wildly exceeded Aman's expectations of him<br><br>Cohen arrived in Damascus in February 1962, posing as a businessman from Argentina who had returned to his native land. At the end of 1961 Syria dissolved its union with Egypt, which had lasted a mere three years. The Ba'ath party was rising to power and Eli Cohen wanted to be there when it actually took power. He carefully cultivated contacts with the Ba'ath leadership, which included the Syrian military attache in Argentina, General Amin al-Hafaz. He continued his social life, spending a lot of time in cafes listening to political gossip. He also held parties at his home, which turned into orgies for high-placed Syrian ministers, businessmen, and others, who used Eli's apartment "for assignations with various women, including Defense Ministry secretaries, airline hostesses, and Syrian singing stars." At these parties such highly-placed officials would "talk freely of their work and army plans. Eli, who would feign intoxication, remained sober and listened carefully." In addition to providing loans to government officials and acting as an avid host, he was asked for advice by government officials, who were often intoxicated by the alcohol he freely provided. Eli himself was not above the spicier part of a spy's life either. "The 'husband hunters' among the Damascus rich and influential flocked to the handsome Ta'abet, hoping that their almond eyes, Byzantine beauty, and olive skin would secure a future of wealth and power: He became the most sought after bachelor in the Syrian capital. He did not object, in fact, to the idea of a ladies' man reputation. He had seventeen lovers in Syria, all dazzling beauties with a fair degree of family power." Eli hoped as did Israeli Intelligence - that these women "would help him escape in time of crisis."<br><br>end of Part 1</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Part 2<br><br>With time he was taken even more into the confidence of the highest echelons of power. He became a confidante of George Saif, high up in the Ministry of Information. "The complete trust Cohen enjoyed among his unwitting informants is illustrated by the following incident, which might have serious consequences for the Israeli agents.<br><br>One day Cohen was sitting in Saif's office reading a classified document while the Syrian was on the phone. One of the ministry's directors entered the room unannounced.<br><br>'How is it that you dare allow a stranger to read a classified document?' he angrily asked Saif.<br><br>Saif calmly replied, 'There's nothing to worry about. He's a trusted friend.'"<br><br>When the Ba'ath took power in 1963, Eli was firmly entrenched in Syrian high society. Meanwhile, every few days he transmitted important information to his Israeli handlers via a radio transmitter he had hidden in his room.<br><br>Periodically Eli would return to Israel to speak with his Israeli handlers and visit his wife and small children. Altogether, he returned to Israel three times between 1962 and 1965.<br><br>At the beginning of this lecture we talked about the Syrian project to divert water from the headwaters of the Jordan away from Israel. Eli was friends with two highly placed Army officers, Colonels Hatoum and Dali, who were fully informed about the scheme. In early 1964, Eli was able to radio Tel Aviv that the channel was being dug along the entire length of the Syrian Heights to receive the diverted flow of the Baniyas River - one of the Jordan's major sources - and empty into Jordanian territory." Eli carefully spelled out all the details of the project and passed them on to Israeli Intelligence. Due to this information, the Israeli Air Force was able to obliterate the Syrian plans for the diversion scheme by shelling and bombing the bulldozers and other equipment used for the scheme in early 1964.<br><br>Eli's connections enabled him to be taken to the Golan Heights - a major strategic asset for Syria from 1948-67. As we saw, the Syrians continually harassed Israel's northern settlements from 1948-67. The Golan Heights defenses were top-secret and closed only to top military staff. "Nevertheless, Kamal Amin Ta'abet (Eli Cohen) succeeded in visiting each and every position. With senior staff officers acting as guides, Eli Cohen was provided an in-depth intelligence briefing of monumental proportions." They even photographed Eli on the Golan Heights, looking over into Israel, alongside the most high-ranking Syrian officers. He remembered and passed on to Israeli Intelligence the "positioning of every Syrian gun, trench, and machine-gun nest in each Golan Heights fortification; tank traps, designed to impede any Israeli attack, were also identified and memorized for future targeting." One of the more famous aspects of his spying regarded a trip he took to the Golan Heights. As the Syrian Army officer explained to Eli the fortifications the Syrian Army had built, Eli suggested that the Syrians plant trees there to deceive the Israelis into thinking it was unfortified, as well as to provide shade and beauty for the soldiers stationed there. The Syrian officer readily agreed - and Eli immediately passed the information onto Israel. Based on the eucalyptus trees, Israel knew exactly where the Syrian fortifications were.<br><br>Eli's friendship with Amin al-Hafez proved very valuable. After Hafez became Prime Minister, Eli was even considered to be named the Syrian Deputy Minister of Defense.<br><br>But changes were taking place in the Syrian Government that alarmed Eli. In addition, the commander of Syrian Intelligence, Colonel Ahmed Su'edani trusted no one and disliked Eli. Eli expressed his fear and wish to terminate his assignment in Syria during his last visit to Israel in November 1964. Still, Israeli Intelligence asked him to return to Syria one more time. The information he had been providing them for years was too good to forego.<br><br>Eli did go back to Syria, but his behavior changed. He became far less careful in his transmissions to Israel, sometimes calling once or even twice a day - and almost always at the same time, at 8:30 in the morning. The transmissions became longer as well. Some attributed this to a sense of cockiness (despite the fears he had expressed in November 1964), due to the ability and ease he had moved about in the highest echelons of Syrian power. Others have attributed the carelessness to an almost suicidal tendency - perhaps, it was later surmised, he had been in the undercover world too long, but knew he couldn't get out of it. Because of that, perhaps he just tired of the whole charade.<br><br>The Syrians and their Russian advisers were alarmed by the intelligence that was seeping out of the country. The highly vigilant Russian security experts, equipped with very sensitive technical intelligence-gathering equipment, pinpointed the source of the transmissions in the Syrian capital - and it was Eli's home. One day in January 1961, Syrian intelligence broke into his home in the middle of a transmission. The leading figure in the break-in was the head of Syrian Intelligence, Colonel Ahmed Su'edani - Eli's nemesis.<br><br>Eli was caught in the act and there was nothing he could do. He was tortured, but he wouldn't give away any incriminating information about Israel. His captors later remarked on his noble bearing and his courage despite the horrific Syrian interrogation methods.<br><br>He then underwent a show trial, like the Operation Susannah spies had in Egypt 12 years before., Like them, his verdict was predetermined.<br><br>World leaders, wealthy individuals, the Israeli government, the Pope, and others all intervened on his behalf. To no avail. He was hanged on May 18, 1965. He wrote a last letter to his wife before he mounted the scaffold to a seething crowd. The execution was broadcast on Syrian television. After his execution, a white parchment filled with anti-Zionist writing was put on his body and he was left hanging for six hours.<br><br>Eli Cohen provided an incredible amount of intelligence data to the Israeli Army over a period of three years. In 1967, the Israelis were able to conquer the Golan Heights in two days - in part due to the intelligence he provided. As Intelligence Chief Meir Amit said, Eli "succeeded far beyond the capabilities of most other men."<br><br>What is perhaps most amazing about Eli Cohen is that he was genuinely liked - even loved - by so many of the top Syrian leaders. He had an input into and an impact on Syrian national defense, and was privy to almost all of their secrets. He genuinely fit into life in the Syrian capital and he was never suspected of being a spy until almost the very end.<br><br>It is for these reasons Eli Cohen is known as Israel's greatest spy.<br><br>Enjoy lah  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br></div>
