ST Marine have made a newer and larger hovercraft, there is an article with picture shown on the Straits Times not too long ago.<br><br>I mentioned Tiger 40 because this is the one already in production as the threadstarter asked about one in production, while the bigger version is more likely to be still in the RnD phase.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Singapore Sailors Experience LCAC Operations<br><br>June 4, 2005<br>By Chief Journalist Melinda Larson, Commander Destroyer Squadron One Public Affairs<br><br>SINGAPORE Â– Republic of Singapore Navy (RSN) officers and sailors gained first-hand knowledge of the U.S. NavyÂ’s landing craft air-cushion (LCAC) June 3 when they were hosted underway by Assault Craft Unit (ACU) 5 Detachment Western Pacific Alfa aboard USS Fort McHenry (LSD 43).<br><br>Â“It was very informative working with such a professional force of operators who have lots of knowledge and experience,Â” said RSN Cpt. Rajesh Dhillon of Fast Craft Unit, a land craft utility (LCU) unit.<br><br>The informational tour was a scheduled event of exercise Cooperation Afloat Readiness and Training (CARAT) 2005. CARAT is a multinational bilateral series of military training exercises with several Southeast Asian nations designed to enhance interoperability of the respective sea services.  The Singapore phase, the first phase in the series, began May 31.<br><br>During their visit, the RSN visitors asked the ACU 5 crew a variety of questions about the versatile landing craft.<br><br>Â“They were interested in learning about the LCACs characteristics and capabilities such as its range, the missions itÂ’s capable of performing, and how many personnel it can carry,Â” said Senior Chief BoatswainÂ’s Mate Steve Alt, officer in charge of the detachment.<br><br>The LCAC is a high-speed, over-the-beach fully amphibious landing craft.  It is used to transport the weapons systems, equipment, cargo and personnel of the assault elements of the Marine Air-Ground Task Force from ship to shore and across the beach.<br><br>After touring the two LCACs deployed aboard Fort McHenry , the group was transported by LCAC to Singapore Â’s military training island of Sudong .<br><br>Â“The LCAC is a very impressive craft because of its mobility,Â” said 1st Sgt. Ryu Peh of RSNÂ’s 3rd Flotilla Headquarters.<br><br>The RSN uses LCUs to transport ground forces but are interested in exploring LCACs as an option to deliver troops and equipment to shore.<br><br>Â“The Singapore crew wanted to know what they should look for and what questions to ask builders of LCACs,Â” Alt said.  Â“The U.S. Navy has been using LCACs since the mid-1980Â’s.  ItÂ’s only natural that we share our knowledge with our allies.Â”<br><br>The U.S. Navy has a fleet of 91 LCACs.  The 2 craft deployed to the Fort McHenry took turns landing on Sudong Island , giving the RSN crew a chance to watch operations both from shore and from onboard the craft.<br><br>Â“I would like to be stationed on an LCAC,Â” said 1st. Sgt. Alvin Lee, a communications specialist for the RSN.  Â“It was very exciting to be able to ride aboard an LCAC.  It was very educational to see how the craft lands on the beach.Â”</div>

This could mean the hovercraft is of local design or a new design developed with a foreign partner."<br><br>The ACV-1 is not ST Marine's first attempt to build a hovercraft. ST Marine jointly developed a 16-meter prototype called Tiger 40 with Air Vehicles Ltd. of the UK in 1987.
