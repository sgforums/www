              <p>Excluding all the signed-on personel like ADF and such, I was wondering which vocation and unit is the most unlucky, for a NSF to be posted to after his BMT phrase.</p>
              <p>and if posted to that unlucky vocation, which one is it, a commander or men position, that is unlucky?</p>

              Ironically, I think it's the clerks.
              
              If you're stuck behind a desk for 2 years, it's really a very big waste of your life. At least in a unit, you get to see some scenery change once in a while.
              
              Shack and siong while outfield and you can curse and swear while suffering, but you really learn a lot of stuff and have quite a bit of fun.
              
              Ended up in BRC, but while I was there, and some of the people there can be real dicks, the courses were very very fun. Bike riding, POW training, survival, rappelling, river crossing, engineering, you get to do a lot of things. Sat every transport heli the SAF had (UH-1 yes I'm that old, Puma, Chinook), raced with kangaroos on a bike in Wallaby, froze my butt off in Rockhampton at night, sneak into village coffeeshop in Thailand to buy drinks then have the brigade commander and HQ stop outside the coffeeshop for a drink while we were hiding in the back, damn funny days.
              
              If you ask me to take a clerk job for 2 years and see the same ming chao chao boss's face every day, I'd go crazy. Rather go outfield.

              <p>those who sit behind desks for 2 years become weaker everyday, those who take on the siong vocation become stronger when they go through the test...there is no reason why we can't take on the test!!</p>

              <p>every vocation will say their vocation is the worst.. For me, I say artillery.. why? here my opinion</p>
              <p>1) My unit have 30+% downgraded</p>
              <p>2) another unit around the same batch have 65% downgraded</p>
              <p>3) I spend more time in field then in my bunk, till we will miss the field even we stay in camp for then a week</p>
              <p>4) i personally did 16 stand by force duty..</p>
              <p>5) for almost 6 months, never did i get off during the weekend.</p>
              <p>6) after BMT, day 1 of vocation training 1 pax jump off biulding</p>
              <p>7) for vocation training(3.5months), the longest night we got to sleep was 5 hrs</p>
              <p>But then, every one will say theirs is worst</p>

              Tough, yes, and jia la. But at least you are not wasting your life moving paper. When I talk to my friends who end up doing paperwork for 2 years, I really pity them. At least we outfield guys got exciting things to do, the clerks can really be said to have wasted 2 years of their lives.
              
              newbie, sounds fun :)
              
              First day in unit, knock it down 2 hours. First month 3 days outfield, one day in camp, 3 days out rotating schedule.
              
              Most fun time I ever had.
              
              Compare it with everyday doing paperwork and see the same old shit faced boss.

              Hmm strange lots of people say clerk is siong.  I was a NSF General Clerk for 2.5 years.  For the uninitiated, there are several types (then), leave, ops etc. Yes I am that old.
              
              Luckily or unluckily I was attached to a recreation unit and I spend my tour, answering telephones, changing jackpot money, billiard room duties, writing never publish articles for Pioneer etc.  On top of that I get to visit all the different branches of SAF.
              
              Other more mundane duties include clearing the jackpot machines of coins.  Back breaking labor.
