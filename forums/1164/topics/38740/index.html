The tanksÂ’ lower surfaces conform to the aircraft shape. Together, a shipset holds 450 gallons, or about 3,060 pounds of JP-5/8 fuel.<br><br>Â“The CFTs significantly increase the F-16 mission range and patrol time on station,Â” said John L. Bean, vice president of F-16 programs. Â“They also provide increased air-to-ground payload potential and greater stores flexibility. The CFTs can be utilized throughout the F-16Â’s full flight envelope and have little or no effect on the F-16Â’s renowned agility, flight performance, handling qualities, existing stores certification, signature and maintainability.Â”<br><br>Development testing of the CFTs was completed in October 2002, and the first production shipset was received at Fort Worth in January 2003. All Advanced Block 50/52 and Block 60 F-16 versions are compatible with the new CFTs.<br><br>"Development and production of the F-16 CFTs was a major task and involved almost all of the disciplines required for a complete aircraft," said Bean. "We are very pleased with the final product and consider it a tribute to all those in industry and government, here and abroad, who made it happen."<br><br>GreeceÂ’s Hellenic Air Force is the lead customer for the CFTs as well as the Advanced Block 52 F-16 version. The production CFTs were flown on two aircraft recently produced for Greece in the 60-aircraft Peace Xenia III Foreign Military Sales program. One aircraft was a C model (single seat), and the other was a D model (two-seat with weapons system operator station and dorsal avionics compartment).<br><br>The F-16, the choice of 24 countries, is the worldÂ’s most sought-after fighter. More than 4,000 aircraft have been delivered, hundreds more are on order for the United States and seven other countries, and production is expected to continue beyond 2010. Major upgrades for all F-16 versions are being incorporated to keep the fleet modern and fully supportable over the aircraftÂ’s long service life.<br><br>Lockheed Martin Aeronautics Co., headquartered in Fort Worth, Texas, is a leader in the design, development, systems integration, production and support of advanced military aircraft and related technologies. Its customers include the military services of the United States and allied countries throughout the world. Products include the F-16, F/A-22, F-35 JSF, F-117, T-50, C-5, C-130J, P-3, S-3 and U-2.<br><br>Headquartered in Bethesda, Md., Lockheed Martin Corp. is a global enterprise principally engaged in the research, design, development, manufacture and integration of advanced technology systems, products and services. Employing about 125,000 people worldwide, Lockheed Martin had 2002 sales of $26.6 billion.<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="Arrow" title="Arrow"> The D model looks cool <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"></div>

After much lobbying to the US Congress / Pentagon, we finally got the OK but instead went ahead and purchased an Israeli equivalent which was reported much cheaper. That really pissed the American for a while.<br><br>Link 16 has been developed to meet the information exchange requirements of all tactical units, supporting the exchange of surveillance data, EW data, mission tasking, weapons assignments and control data.The Link 16 message standard uses J-series messages and completely meets the requirements for C2 functionality and aircraft control. In addition Link 16 has been selected by the US and NATO as the main tactical data link for Theatre Missile Defence.<br><br>Numerous platforms have been or will be equipped with Link 16 (Airborne Surveillance and Intelligence Systems, C2 Systems, Fighter and Bomber Aircraft, SAM Systems, Ships, etc). The UK has implemented Link 16 in its E-3D AWACS &amp; Tornado F3 fleet. Furthermore implementation is underway for RN ships and aircraft and other RAF C2 platforms and aircraft.<br><br>Link 16 has been established as the NATO standard data link. The highly sophisticated information distribution system provides real-time, jam-resistant secure transfer of combat information and relative navigation between widely dispersed battle elements. Participants gain situational awareness by exchanging digital data over a common communication link that is continuously and automatically updated in real time, reducing the chance of duplicate assignments or missed targets because each participant sees the targets or threats and who is assigned to them.<br><br><img src="http://prodevweb.prodev.usna.edu/SeaNav/NS40x/NS401_old/introduction/html/images/linkring3.gif"><br><br>See some references:<br><a href="http://prodevweb.prodev.usna.edu/SeaNav/NS40x/NS401_old/introduction/html/introduc.html" rel="nofollow">http://prodevweb.prodev.usna.edu/SeaNav/NS40x/NS401_old/introduction/html/introduc.html</a><br><a href="http://www.stasys.co.uk/tdl/tdl4.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.stasys.co.uk/tdl/tdl4.htm</a><br><br>Hope this helps.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>...Oh...<br><br>on the RSAF rejection topic:<br><br>"Singapore has rejected a US offer of the Link 16 tactical datalink in favour of a cheaper Israeli alternative to equip its F-16C/D and A-4SU strike aircraft. The move has angered officials in Washington who question the Israeli-made datalink's ability to interface with Link 16s TADIL-J waveform and therefore doubt the ability of USA forces to operate jointly with RSAF aircraft operating with the Israeli datalinks. US defense officials had in 1998 secured unprecedented approval for Link 16 to be released to the RSAF and more recently overcome the problem of encryption code access, only to see negotiations over the sale break down due to a failure to reach agreement on price.
