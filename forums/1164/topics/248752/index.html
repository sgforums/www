            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by moca:</div><div class="quote_body">What a black beauty that is. Does P1 means it's a modern day pistol? The WW2 kraut Walters were called P38, right?</div></blockquote>The P38 was produced in large numbers during and after WW2. Sometime in the 1950s (if I remember correctly), the design was updated slightly, and the pistol redesignated the P1.<br><br>Since production of the P1 continued all the way into the 1990s, I would definitely consider it a "modern day pistol." <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"><br><br><blockquote><strong>Does "military surplus" means it was never issued for service? It look like mint condition.</strong></blockquote>Milsurp firearms might or might not have seen actual usage. It is entirely possible that there might be crateloads of brand-new, unissued firearms sitting in an arsenal at the time they are declared obsolete.<br><br>Milsurp firearms sold in this country are usually graded and priced according to their condition, with the unissued ones commanding the highest prices. However, a batch of used milsurp firearms might occasionally have some unissued example mixed in with it. Such was the case with my particular P1. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br><br>(If you look real close at the images, however, you will notice some very minor scratches on the finish. Though a milsurp firearm might be unissued, it will almost always exhibit some minor handling wear.)<br><br><blockquote><strong>How much is such a piece worth? As a comparison, how much is, say, a standard 92F?</strong></blockquote>The worth of a milsurp firearm can vary considerably based on such factors as when and where it was manufactured, its physical condition, historical significance, and availability. Using the P38/P1 as an example, a P38 that was made in WW2 and actually used by the Wehrmacht could fetch well over US$1000, whereas a P1 that was manufactured in the 1980s for the Bundeswehr (but never issued) would be worth no more than about US$250.<br><br>A brand new Beretta 92FS can be currently purchased for around US$550 at the retail level.<br><br><blockquote><strong>What's its performance like in terms of reliability and accuracy? The 92F has a large mag capacity compared to the Walter, which means a bigger grip.<br><br>Is the barrel longer than on a 92F?</strong></blockquote>For a military-issue sidearm, the P1 is surprisingly accurate. My particular example will print a sub-3" group at 20 yards when slow-fired offhand. I have not put a lot of rounds through it as of this writing (I would estimate no more than 500 of my handloads), but it hasn't burped or jammed on me thus far.<br><br>The P1's magazine holds 8 rounds, while the 92FS can hold either 15 or 16 rounds (depending on the magazine manufacturer), so yes, the grip of the 92FS is necessarily larger.<br><br>Both the P1 and full-size 92FS have barrels that are approximately  4.92" in length.<br><br><blockquote><strong>Sorry, so many questions.</strong></blockquote>Hope I answered most of them to your satisfaction. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"></div>
