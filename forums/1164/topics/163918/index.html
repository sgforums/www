            <div class='col-md body'>Chinese build a high-tech army within an army<br><br>By Robert Marquand, Staff writer of The Christian Science Monitor<br>Thu Nov 17, 3:00 AM ET<br><br>BEIJING - Shi Jin wears a jean jacket, has razor-cropped hair, and seems gravely earnest. An officer in the People's Liberation Army, he was wooed from a Beijing vocational college three years ago by recruiters who talked up his technical aptitude - and his patriotism.<br><br>In the past decade, China has undergone two military high-tech reforms designed to give the country a modern fighting force. To sustain that progress, it must attract many more gung-ho young engineers like Shi, who spends most of his time working on an "informational" revolution that planners hope will one day allow them to "see" a battlefield with the same depth as the US military. "I will not do any direct fighting if there is a war, but I am contributing on the technical side," he says. "We are all needed in the new Army."<br><br>China's desire, often stated, is to be a great nation. Many in Beijing feel that the country's natural right is to be the major power in Asia. But China has rarely been given high marks in global military annals. It has a "brown water" Navy that doesn't navigate open seas. It can't project power by sending forces abroad. It has relied on states like Russia for jet fighters, cruise missiles, and other advanced weapons.<br><br>Yet it now appears China is methodically changing this equation.<br><br>In a surprisingly short time, China has accomplished two feats. One, it has focused its energy and wealth on creating an army within an army. It has devoted huge amounts of capital to create a small high-tech army within its old 2.2 million-member rifle and shoe-leather force.<br><br>The specialty of this modern force, about 15 percent of the PLA, is to conduct lightning attacks on smaller foes, using an all-out missile attack designed to paralyze, and a modern sea and air attack coordinated by high-tech communications. In other words, this new modern force is designed to attack Taiwan.<br><br>Second, China has taken painful but successful steps to create a "defense industrial base," or weapons-building capability. The PLA has improved its factory quality control and its ability to adapt foreign technology. It is bringing an indigenous small-wing F-10 fighter off the production line, and it is moving rapidly toward a "blue water" Navy with ships built in China.<br><br>Indeed, the past three years have yielded the impressive fruits of a modernization campaign started in the late 1990s: A nuclear attack submarine, the 093, launches in months; presumably it will be capable one day of firing satellite-guided cruise missiles that can blast a cruiser or carrier. China now has more accurate ICBMS, a host of land- and sea-based cruise missiles, and about 400 Su-27 and Su-30 Russian fighter jets it didn't have before.<br><br>"Do the old shibboleths still apply - that the Chinese defense industry is backward, poor, and low-quality?" asks Evan Medeiros, an analyst with the RAND Corp. in Washington, D.C.<br><br>"No," he says. "It seems China has turned the corner.... For the first time in 20 years, the PLA has adopted reforms that make sense. They adopted, and implemented, and are really learning quickly." Medeiros is lead author of a 300-page RAND study, "New Directions for China's Defense Industry," released this month.<br><br>"The PLA has undergone a revolution in communications," says James Mulvenon, of the Center for Intelligence Research and Analysis in Washington, D.C. "They have gone from dirt to wireless in a generation."<br><br>Taking China's power seriously<br><br>Such progress is catching attention, respect, and concern in the Pentagon. At Honolulu's US Pacific Command, and in military circles in Taiwan, Guam, and Tokyo, it is universally accepted that China is on its way to becoming a military challenge in Asia. US planners no longer talk dismissively of China's power or, potentially, its reach. In a key shift, US ability to quickly and easily defend Taiwan in an attack is no longer a given. Chinese cruise missiles are creating a more lethal environment in the Taiwan Straits.<br><br><strong>This summer, Gen. Zhu Chenghu, dean of China's National Defense University, raised the subject of weapons of mass destruction, which China rarely mentions, in connection with Taiwan. Should US forces aid Taiwan in a war, he told bewildered US visitors, "Americans will have to be prepared that hundreds ... of cities will be destroyed by Chinese" nuclear weapons.</strong><br><br>Coming to Taiwan's rescue "used to be a political decision," says Denny Roy, an expert on cross-straits relations at the Asia-Pacific Center for Security Studies (APCSS) in Honolulu. "Now it is a political and a military decision."<br><br>Yet while China may have turned a corner, tomorrow's Monitor story looks at how China's military prowess runs far short of the doomsday trend lines. China's military has not "leapfrogged" into modern warfighting in the way many alarmists in the US often loudly suggest.<br><br>Perceptions about a "China threat" have taken several sharp turns in the past 24 months. One came in 2004, as it appeared Beijing was making progress on not one but three submarine programs, including the 093. A Sovremenny class destroyer, one of four new Chinese-made destroyers appeared out of the blue. China was laying fiber-optic cable around the country; it was developing a capability at the heart of high-tech warfare called C4ISR (the interlocking sets of missile targeting and tracking known as command, control, communications, computers, intelligence surveillance and reconnaissance).<br><br>read the rest below<br><br><a href="http://news.yahoo.com/s/csm/ochina" rel="nofollow">http://news.yahoo.com/s/csm/ochina</a></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>hey, guys, I hope more discussions are military orientated. Restrain from what should discussed in speakerÂ’s corner.<br><br>Yes, no doubt, the defense industry is booming in PRC in coordination with their booming economy. Should this be an alert? I hardly think so, the leader of PRC is aware enough their fragile defense industries are still a far cry from those in US of A. What they currently are doing now is more on accumulations on knowledge, manufacturing small batches of new weaponry for demo and build up the database.  And keep pace not far behind from the lonely Â“world policeÂ” nation. But even doing so, there are already few nations left in earth can do the same, thatÂ’s why the Yankees are so alert.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I live and work in Shanghai.<br><br>Those of you - ethnic Chinese Singaporeans - who feels you have more in common with Americans than with Chinese, might have a slight change of mind after you have lived in both countries.<br><br>I like Americans, they are friendly and chatty. And yes, I do feel I have a lot in common with them. However, not all Americans feel that way about Singaporeans.<br><br>People in China, I must admit, have a long way to go to improve their image. However, once you go beyond the rough manners, the language, and many other small details, we basically share the same cultural identity.<br><br>There are many young Chinese people whom are as cosmopolitan, well-schooled and well-educated as you can get. It's not as bad as some make it out to be.<br><br>Why is China being big and powerful necessarily a bad thing? The SG government had been shrewdly playing diplomacy to both sides for decades. China sees us more as an ally than as an enemy even though our troops train in Taiwan and US ships dock here.<br><br>The reason they have not protested about SG troops in Taiwan must surely be becos SG government had quietly reassured the Chinese government of non-hostile intentions and China agreed to turn a blind eye. China intel is good so they must definitely know of the presence of SG troops in Taiwan.<br><br>So if China is the big brother in Asia, we don't stand to lose out necessarily.

            <div class='col-md body'>A recent issue of TIME magazine featured LKY (I'm a big fan) on the front cover.<br><br>The article revealed what we already know: LKY had been a close confidante of Chinese officials for over 30 years since Deng took over power. Many features of China's modernisation are modelled on Singapore's.<br><br>The Chinese didn't go and consult with anyone else, they chose to trust an ethnic Chinese statesman - LKY.<br><br>You can say blood don't matter - and in many things, it doesn't. But being a diplomat - LKY played both sides of the field. He made use of his race to foster close ties with the Chinese - albeit in a more clandestine fashion - and at the same time he uses his western ways to woo the Americans.<br><br>Anyone who feel we are under any sort of threat from the Chinese, I can only say these are unfounded fears. If nothing else, they will be very very keen to have a close - and powerful - ally like us in this part of the world. But Singapore willl continue to play both sides of the field to use China to counter US influence and vice versa.<br><br>Too much US of A is also a very bad thing.</div>
