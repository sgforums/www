Any bomber role would be better filled by multi-role, felixble aircraft that can do many things other than just be a huge lumbering target that carries thousands of pounds of bombs or cruise missiles.<br>Singapore already has aircraft that fills this role - from the recently retired A-4's to the Tiger II's to the F-16's.<br>these are more than capable.<br><br>There is no need for a B-52 or any kind of dedicated bomber role in singapores military.<br><br>Why do you think the former Soviet Union, China and the Us are the only main nations that still use strategic bombers?<br>No one else does because:<br>1) they dont need it<br>2) modern multi-role aircraft can do the bombing if so required.<br>3) cheaper cost per unit in above than in dedicated bomber platforms.<br><br>its no use looking at a picture and saying 'thats cool! lets have one!'.<br>Theres a rhyme and reason for everything.

The Lancer wasnt.<br><br>For an aircraft to switch roles and carry certain types of bombs it must go through process, tests, and certification.<br>at the time of GW1, the Lancer hadnt done this, or was going through this and so wasnt allowed to partake in the war until it was certified to do so.<br><br>The rest of the fleet has only recently been upgraded to carry and deploy the joint direct munitions, which was used by a small number of Lancers in afghanistan and iraq.<br><br><blockquote>hmmm can sae tat tis is also the biggest WEAKNESS of the united states armed forces....<br><br>all its weapons system is geared towards ONE kind of mission...not realli multi-mission capable...but then again the weapons system is virtually the best when employed in tat particular mission</blockquote>possibly for any other country, but not for the united states and anyone who works with her in joint ops.<br>each singular role platform can perform to its best capabilities that one role - and be focused on it without having to worry about anything else that a multi-role would have to.<br><br>multi-role is cost-effective, but not always combat effective.<br>singular role also means you travel in a package - and multi targets are harder to engage than just one..<br>imagine a multi-role platform has to roll in, take out the aerial defenses before it can get to the target, cope with aerial combatants, and then do it all again on its return journey.<br>a singular-role platform can go in and just focus on say bombing the target, while another knocks out all the aerial defenses while several more keep aerial combatants at bay - that way theres a higher percentage of aircraft coming home, and of the mission being a success.<br>Wild Weasel missions in the Vietnam war proved that this kind of concept was effective - before, when a mulit-role aircraft had to everything, it was basically being tied down because it was trying to do too much - and it became a much easier target for doing so..<br><br>example package: BUFF or Lancer goes in, with maybe two bombers, two 15s for fighter cap, 16s carry harms for air defense suppression [modern day wild weasels], and a couple of 15s and 16s for extra bombing.<br>the bombers can get on with their role and concentrate on dropping more ordnance than any of the other multi-role aircraft put together..and dont have to carry other ordnance, because the 15s and 16s are taking care of that..<br><br>multi-roles are good for smaller ops, maybe less lethal ops, and surgical strikes, and they do well for countries that cannot afford everything that goes<br>with the modern mixed bomber package that the us model has [and has been shown to work very effectively].<br><br>Not to say that the us doesnt operate multi-role aircraft effectively - they do - these are fielded faster and more effectively than any of the bomber fleet could, simply because their role doesnt cover say what a 15 or 16 or even an 18 does, they can be on-station and doing whatever thats required of them fast.<br>but get them on a multi-bomber mission dropping huge amounts of ordnance, maybe over a wide area? get the BUFFs and Lancers [and perhaps now the B-2's] for that..<br><br></div>
