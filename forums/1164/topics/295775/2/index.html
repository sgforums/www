Black magic? But you have to figure out, how an F15J was shot down accidently by a sidewinder from another fighter, a same type F15J!<br><br>Actually what fvwerra talked about the RMAF limited offensive ability is most likely caused by monkey version F-18 exported by Yanks, some functions are locked by Uncle Sammie prior to export. CanÂ’t get what I mean? Think about one daily item, say,  Nvidia  manufactures the same structure graphic card chips to achieve maximum volume, but Nvidia is offering different level of Graphic cards to the market, like GF7200, GF7600, how does Nvidia do it? Very simple, they just lock some function of the same structure chip to let it become low end GF7200, those without locking, become relatively high end GF7600.<br></div>

It has NOTHING to do with IFF.  What is suggested is that even if the IFF indicates a hostile contact, a radar such as the APG-68 is unable to enter STT mode to provide firing solutions for missiles BECAUSE the target in question is a western aircraft.<br><br>2ndly, IFF tells friendliesthat you are friendly. Don't you think its questionable for an aircraft system to broadcast that you are Hostile? Might as well paint bullseyes on the wings... oh wait, the RAF already does that.<br><br>Correct, RWRs are coupled with systems that are usually capable of identifying the aircraft type.  PROVIDED the aircraft is emitting.<br><br>If the target is not emitting, and you are not near 0 or 180 aspect of the aircraft, its hard for the radar's NCTR to identify the target.</div>

But U.S. allies are now demanding that this practice be stopped. For example, Israel and Turkey want U.S. companies to transfer software the fire-control radar source codes in order to win major attack helicopter contracts. Germany has also threatened to pull out of joint development of the Medium Extended Air Defense System (MEADS) because of the black boxes around U.S. technology.<br><br>So far, the Pentagon has resisted succumbing to this blackmail, but signs point to a reversal in policy. Recent reports state that Germany will gain access to the MEADS "black box" technology , and Israel is confident that it will be granted the source codes it requested. Once the precedent is set, it will be difficult to resist demands from other allies. Technology transfer at this level will not only enable states to incorporate U.S. technology into their exported arms, but also to adapt their own equipment in a way which may threaten U.S. interests. For example, source codes for fighter aircraft radars allow the user to change the pre-set friend or foe designator.<br><br></blockquote>"source codes for fighter aircraft radars allow the user to change the pre-set friend or foe designator".  what does this mean?  how would they know which one will be friend today and foe tomorrow?<br><br>http://www.fas.org/faspir/v53n2a.htm</div>

The IFF interrogates and awaits for a return code signal.  If the other aircraft doesn't give a valid response code, then the target is a bogey.<br><br>Bogey designation does not equate to Bandit.  Bogey is an unidentified, while has been identified by either electronic means or visual means to be believed as a hostile.<br><br>And finally, a friendly radar can still lock on to a friendly aircraft. Even if the IFF says its friendly.  So what is suggested that Western or rather US aircraft radar is unable to target US aircraft is very questionable.  If a friendly aircraft gets locked by a friendly radar, it has to report, "callsign11, buddy spike, bullseye 260(heading), 50 miles(distance)."  Aircraft currently spiking on Guard VHF has to check if they've got someone locked at that location and return to Search mode to prevent friendly fire.  At least, thats as far as I know goes on.<br><br>As for Blue on Blue incidents, even if theres an IFF failure, there protocols (like above) in place to prevent them.  Chances are, there's a breach in protocol somewhere. Maybe trigger happy pilots?  People are not supposed to go around shooting bogeys unless cleared by AWACs.  A bogey could be a bandit but also could be malfunctioning aircraft returning from a sortie, (comms out, IFF out, radar out, and no way of broadcasting its identity unless with a wingman.)</div>

So, if there is anyway of transmitting your identity, eg turning on ur radar and hoping friendlies ESM identify you, or trying to contact AWACs if you still can communicate.  Usually, battle damage would not allow one to do any of these.<br><br>It was a sad incident for the Tornado pilots.

IMO, its more politics than meets the eye.  As for M'sia's F-18s, again, no technical details were made known.  What exactly prevented them from "dropping" bombs.  From what I understand, the computer needs to know what bomb its carrying in order to load the right algorithms for bomb impact calculations to occur. So, if the M'sians didn't buy the bombs they wanted to load in their original purchase, then there is a chance, that those weapon's data weren't loaded.  Of course, thats just me guessing.</div>
