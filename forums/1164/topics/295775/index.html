            <div class='col-md body'>DATE:06/12/07<br>SOURCE:Flight International<br>Malaysia weighs Boeing, Sukhoi bids for next fighter deal<br>By Siva Govindasamy<br><br>Malaysia is expected to choose between a second batch of Sukhoi Su-30MKMs or Boeing F/A-18E/F Super Hornets for its next fighter purchase, with industry sources saying both types have their supporters within the nation's defence establishment.<br><br>The procurement process is unlikely to begin until the Malaysian government has called a general election, scheduled for 2009 but widely expected next year. A decision on new fighters must be made around the end of 2008 in order to secure funding during Kuala Lumpur's 2011-15 five-year plan, with deliveries expected from 2011.<br><br>Malaysia already has 18 Su-30MKMs on order, with six scheduled for delivery by year-end and the remainder to follow in 2008, ahead of its first squadron becoming combat-ready by early 2009. The type is considered favourite for the new fighter deal, with senior air force officers believed to be backing a follow-on order for another 18, which they say will allow the service to eventually operate a single fighter type, cut expenses and increase overall combat potential.<br><br>But some quarters are sceptical about the reliability of Russian equipment. Malaysia suffered problems with its earlier batch of 16 RSK MiG-29Ns, and Malaysian pilots involved in the Su-30MKM programme say additional work needs to be done to integrate French, German, Indian and Russian equipment with the new aircraft.<br><br>Industry sources say the Super Hornet is more popular in the defence ministry, as its cost is similar to the Su-30MKM, while Australia's recent order for 24 F/A-18Fs has boosted the type's export credibility. Boeing has not made a formal presentation to the Malaysian government, but will offer the Super Hornet if it moves forward with the project.<br><br>Kuala Lumpur's immediate procurement priorities are for new utility helicopters, airborne early warning and control and maritime patrol aircraft, so it could instead opt to upgrade its eight F/A-18Ds and MiG-29Ns, which have at least six years of life left without modification.<br><br>"Fighters are not an immediate requirement," says one industry official. "Malaysia must live up to its commitment to monitor the waters around it, especially the Malacca Straits." This need has taken on added urgency following recent AEW&amp;C and MPA procurements by Singapore and Thailand, the source adds.<br><br>ATSC announced during the LIMA air show in Langkawi that it has renewed a contract to provide maintenance services for Malaysia's MiG-29s, and signed a new agreement to provide similar services for the Su-30MKM. Cobham also announced the receipt of an order to provide buddy-buddy refuelling systems for use by the latter type.<br><br><a href="http://www.flightglobal.com/articles/2007/12/06/220117/malaysia-weighs-boeing-sukhoi-bids-for-next-fighter.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.flightglobal.com/articles/2007/12/06/220117/malaysia-weighs-boeing-sukhoi-bids-for-next-fighter.html</a></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Most probably, KL will select both types rather than just shortlist the preference to just 1 type.<br><br>No doubt KL's 'Look-Russian' hardware viewpoint is of not putting all their eggs in a single basket (solely US-made types), but by going solely for only SU-30MKMs or even coupled with the possible acquisition of Mi-17 to replace the Nuri, meant that KL will just transfer their eggs from one basket (US) to another (Russia).<br><br>Therefore, no doubt the Flanker maintenance record leaves much to be desired or even the continual systems intergration problems still not addressed, the Flanker's capability may convince KL that it is the best counter to the RSAF Eagles or even to the Lightning II.  So, I believe that more Flankers may be procured here to replace the remaining MiG-29 fleet; and the F/A-18Fs (after swapping the Ds with Boeing) will be procured too to permit them to set up at least 1 squadron of Rhinos for the maritime strike role and to create an 'invisible threat' to Sing's SLOC.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote>: Thanks to reader N. Mohamed, we now know that in 2005, MINDEF purchased 20 Amraams from the US. The matter was reported to the UN Conventional Arms Register.<br><br>What is the UN Conventional Arms Register? According to its website:<br><br>On 6 December 1991, the General Assembly adopted resolution 46/36 L entitled Â“Transparency in armamentsÂ”, which requested the Secretary-General to establish and maintain at United Nations Headquarters in New York a universal and non-discriminatory Register of Conventional Arms, to include data on international arms transfers as well as information provided by Member States on military holdings, procurement through national production and relevant policies.<br><br>The Register comprises seven categories of major conventional arms, namely, battle tanks, armored combat vehicles, large-calibre artillery systems, combat aircraft, attack helicopters, warships (including submarines) as well as missiles and missile-launchers. It has been in operation with effect from calendar year 1992. Thus far, a total of 170 Member States have reported to the Register one or more times. The Register captures the great bulk of the global arms trade in the categories of conventional weapons covered by it.</blockquote></div>
