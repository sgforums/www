              <p>no kidding, the mosque people will probably kill lionnoisy.</p>
              <p>but anyway, isnt the mosque ( the one with the cemeteries around it ?) on the wrong side of the slope ?</p>
              <p>towards lim chu kang camp II the road has an incline. mosque probably can see low flying aircraft but definitely cant watch them land.</p>
              <p>the best place i can think off that isnt off limits to public would be from the chicken farm area. there's quite a few slip roads that are angled and can sit there to watch. but the problem would be have to leg it there without getting seen by airbase security.</p>
              <p>on 2nd thoughts, haha , can ask lionnoisy go then hope he gets picked up by airbase/airfield security in their terrex.</p>

              <p>I'm tired of seeing people lambasting Lionnoisy. While I don't know him and don't care about his well-being, I think it is just a lack of courtesy to attack him if you disagree with his views. As if some of you guys have a vendetta.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Anyway back to the topic, I just came back from watching the Alternate Runway Exercise. I viewed from Chinese Cemetery Path 22, which offered a clear view of about 300m of Lim Chu Kang Road. That's the closest to LCK Road that unaccredited members of the public can get to. Members of the public with passes can watch from a big RSAF tent beside LCK Road and even have the benefit of a TV wall.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Saw the airplanes take off, do touch &amp; go and finally land. After taking off, they even formed a 4 ship echelon formation of F-16s. They go in a south to north direction. Today's rehearsal started 10:10 and ended at 10:30.</p>

                      First, there was F1. Now come the F-16s. After a Formula One (F1) Grand
                      Prix auto race in September, Singapore streets on Sunday will see
                      something even faster -- F-16 fighter bombers. <br><br>The jets and
                      other military aircraft are to take off and land on a stretch of road
                      which has been converted into an alternative runway, the Ministry of
                      Defence said. <br><br>The <a id="KonaLink2" class="kLink" style="text-decoration: underline ! important; position: static;" href="http://news.indiainfo.com/2008/11/29/0811291006_singapore-military-runway.html"><span style="color: blue;"><span class="kLink" style="color: blue ! important; font-family: Arial; font-weight: 400; font-size: 13px; position: static;">exercise</span></span></a>,
                      which helps prepare the air force in case normal runways become
                      unusable, hones its readiness "to deliver uninterrupted air power at
                      all times," a statement said. <br><br>"The aircraft will be executing
                      a series of take-offs and landings along a stretch of Lim Chu Kang
                      Road, 2,500 metres long (1.6 miles) and 24 metres wide," the ministry
                      said. <br><br>Singapore is an island nation of just 3.6 million
                      citizens and permanent residents which was ejected from the Malaysian
                      Federation in 1965 over ethnic issues. <br><br>The security-conscious
                      city-state, one of Asia's wealthiest, also has one of the region's most
                      modern armed forces. All able-bodied 18-year-old male citizens are
                      eligible to be conscripted for two years of full-time active service in
                      the military or emergency services. <br><br>Military planes and helicopters often roar over parts of the city on their way into and out of air bases. <br><br>"In
                      war, runways are one of the key targets for the enemy," Colonel Tan Kah
                      Han, who is overseeing the exercise, was quoted as saying in The
                      Straits Times. The exercise will involve more than 10 aircraft
                      including F-5 jets and E-2C early warning planes as well as F-16s, the
                      defence ministry said. <br><br>Troops will set up a mobile control
                      tower, lights, and cables to help stop the planes when they land, it
                      said. The Straits Times reported that about 400 air force personnel
                      have been removing lamp posts, road signs and bus shelters in
                      preparation. The six-lane road on the far west of the island has been
                      closed since Thursday and will reopen on Monday, it said. <br><br>This is the sixth exercise of its kind in the past 22 years, the ministry said.</p>

              <p>LOL... wicked maurizio wicked.</p>
              <p>.. lionnoisy are you that stupid ? Lim chu kang rd is the road where the planes are landing. its the only connector between sarimbun/ lim chu kang farmway areas and jalan bahar/old chua chu kang road.</p>
              <p>other routes are all restricted/off limits to public access. unless you want to take a hike through area D or the cemetries.</p>
              <p>and what other places can watch ?</p>
              <p>jalan bahar - incline, can see low flying aircraft but nothing much.</p>
              <p>Old lim chu kang road - too much foliage, restricted area</p>
              <p>Lim chu kang farmway - too far away</p>
              <p>old choa-chu kang road- blocked by tengah airway fence.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>lionnoisy oh lionnoisy... you really love to self pwn eh ? you like going so much ild encourage you to make your way down. ild give tengah airbase security a call and remind them to get you for your rabid posting here.</p>

              <p>I still think that everyone is entitled to their opinions. Though we may not agree with each other's line of thinking, public ridicule and attack of others is very unnecessary and doesn't reflect well on one's character. It would be good to see everyone show more tolerance and restraint in these public posts. I'm certain that when you deal with others face to face, you are rather measured in what you say, right?</p>
              <p>Anyway, I reiterate that I'm not writing to defend Lionnoisy. I have nothing to do with him. Plus I've never found his posts to contain incitement of anger and hatred, so I don't see why anyone should come out so strongly against him. Just a little nonsensical sometimes   : )</p>

              <p> </p>
              <p>regarding lionnoisy :</p>
              <p>to have a balanced and reasoned approach in a normal discussion/thread assumes a certain disposition/expectation in which the manner of dialogue or discussion is expected to be reciprocated.</p>
              <p>Lionnoisy fails to understand this. this is why people come out strongly on this. No one here is publicly riducling lionnoisy or attacking his character. we are trying to speak his language.</p>
              <p>let me use an analogy to explain this, Lionnoisy is walking around with a bat asking who wants to get some. when a whole group of us take up bats and actually whack him (figuratively), he is being reciprocrated in the same manner in which he is treating society.</p>
              <p>you can call it Retribution, i call it balanced social response. if he's going to act like a moron, expect to be treated like one. dont expect him to be treated in a fair manner because he justly deserves it.</p>
              <p>i.e if he is reasonable, logical and congruent like you are, nobody would be doing that to him. we would be having a reasonable discussion.</p>
              <p>its not a matter of being nice, sitting comfortable on a moral high ground and saying the usual stuff about respecting individual opinions and free speech. the matter here is When given the right of speech, and someone blatantly abuses it. such abuses have to be stopped, not tolerated.</p>
              <p>i.e if someone goes about saying about race and religion, does society have a right to stop him ? hell yeah, people who deliberately provoke social order for no apparent and justifiable reason should not be left unpunished.</p>
              <p>i understand where you are coming from, but if youve been here long enough to see his reaction, its just another incident in a long chain of idiocity.</p>

              <p>I've read many of his posts actually from the past year, just that I seldom write. While I do not find his posts to be of high quality, I don't find them offensive either. Anyway, my mantra is that whatever one wants to write online, just imagine you are with that person face to face. Will you say in his face the things that you will write online? Online anonymity often produces language far more strong than what one will say in person. For instance, writing online to tell someone to die. Can you do that face to face? If what one say/write turns out to be prophetic, how will you feel? Is his behaviour so wrentched that he has to die for it?</p>

              <p>I m not Australian but the tone and content of his postings on Australia are simply unforgivable. His bigotry is so transparent. And its not just on Australian stuff, alot more stuff too.</p>
              <p>if this were dialogue/ face to face communications with me and he was talking about Australia like that, I'd get the Australian embassy and myself to sue him for slander. .He's lucky that he posts his views here on a forum and not publicly where he'd be liable to face responsibility for his nonsense.</p>
              <p>it works both ways, here he has the freedom to post and communicate on forums with the benefit of annonymity. I doubt he'd express the same views that he does here in publicly.</p>
              <p>i understand the restraint you are urging. let me quote a line out of shakespeare for you, from measure for measure</p>
              <blockquote>
              <p>LUCIO <br> Why, how now, Claudio! whence comes this restraint?</p>
              <p>CLAUDIO <br> From too much liberty, my Lucio, liberty: <br> As surfeit is the father of much fast, <br> So every scope by the immoderate use <br> Turns to restraint. Our natures do pursue, <br> Like rats that ravin down their proper bane, <br> A thirsty evil; and when we drink we die.</p>
              </blockquote>
              <p>same situation here. you give people liberty to post with certain unmentioned caveats. some people abuse it. till the point where :</p>
              <blockquote>
              <p><span style="font-family: trebuchet ms; font-size: 85%;">Duke: "…So our decrees,<br>Dead to infliction, to themselves are dead,<br>And Liberty plucks Justice by the nose.<br>The baby beats the nurse, and <span style="text-decoration: underline;">quite athwart<br>Goes all decorum."</span></span></p>
              <p> </p>
              </blockquote>
              <p>see ?</p>
              <p>its not about restraint. its about abusing the system. restraint is a knee jerk reaction to the abuse. its not going to solve anything.</p>
