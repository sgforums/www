              <p>Flag : blatant disregard for country bashing, in offence of directive by mod.</p>
              <p>Lionnoisy, i spent a good 6 months in Australia on exchange. its a good place to live in. no wonder they rejected your PR application.</p>
              <p>its called freedom.Freedom has a price and has its drawbacks.</p>
              <p>its better than having a nanny state that panders to its population and treats its populace as if they were no more than 5 year old kids.</p>
              <p>what about the chinese peidu mama and her kid which were murdered by their landlord ? what about the pure blatant discrimination against indian workers by the serangoon gardens crowd ? what about the robber at UOB capital plaza ? what about the maybank armed robbery which they never caught 2 years ago ? what about DBS high notes 5 and 3 ?what about the DBS taking responsibility for investors who were mislead ? must it take a wanna-be politician with vested interest to armtwist MAS and the government into forcing DBS to reimburse the population ? why temasek-linked banking giants cannot follow the lead of Hong Kong Monetary authority directive to banks and reimbursed affected consumers who buy the lehman-brother linked products ?</p>
              <p>why posting about australia here ? cant answer the SOCOM questions i raised right ? dare to reply here dare not reply elesewhere ?</p>
              <p>whats a queene ?</p>
              <p>dont showcase your bigotry here lionnoisy. i wont let it go away that easily.</p>
              <p>screw you and your bigotry lionnoisy. dont talk trash here. if you want to talk trash ild take it up with you point by point.</p>

              <p>1) the picture is found in your photobucket album. it implies ownership. which is in fact, <strong>THEFT of MEDIACORP intellectual property rights</strong></p>
              <p>2) the picture is from mediacorp today and was released in PDF file format. it clearly shows Mediacorp is the content owner here.</p>
              <p>3) the link is part of the picture and not acknowledgement of content rights. the picture itself is located on your photobucket album. which implies you own the image. not mediacorp.</p>
              <p>in effect, the link on the picture is inconsequential. you dont own the image and here you are distributing the image around. that is copyright infringment you idiot.</p>
              <p>4) mediacorp T&amp;C of use specify that you may not alter or change the PDF format in which online today is distributed. i.e Create deriavative works.</p>
              <p>i give you 30mins to take it down before i email Mediacorp today. you've had your warning, you blatantly abuse things and ignore copyright laws.</p>

              <p>Hello Lion, did u know that there is alot of preparations to

              <p>it is emergency one?I dunt get your point.Few hundred people to convert LCK Rd from road to a runway ,in 48 hours,worth every single cent!!</p>
              <p>Even they take one week to convert is still a runway!!</p>
              <p>2.Do u mean RSAF is bull sxxx again by declaring this is a Runway Exercise?</p>

              <p>i thought it was one of the defining characterisitics of our 52
                  ++</p>
              <p>The F16Cs are the single seater ones that are clean and without
                  CFTs. 52 D++ are all 2 seaters with a pilot and wso C3 at the
                  back.</p>

              <p>it's a modular thing, that can be fixed on or taken off according to mission profile ...</p>
              <p>it's not quite like the FAST pack on strike eagles ...</p>
              <p>and we had two crop of Ds one from the nineties, viper 52Ds, all with the spine, but only one regularly flies with the conformal tanks I hear... , which is the latest viper Ds 52++ .... and our vipers at the lukes detachments for example, are never seen with the CFTs ...</p>
              <p>anyone caught the tail markings? </p>
              <p>don't have to look far to find examples of our Ds without the conformal tanks</p>

              <p>this one's at pitch black 2006,  no CFTs</p>

              <p>and this one's at pitch black this year</p>

              <p>it's interesting to note that you don't see DASH attachments on all of our vipers ... and even aircraft with the tell tale gadget and trailing wire on the canopy overhead doesn't get flown with the helmet all the time.</p>

              <p>okie, I guess I should practise what I preach, no unit numbers and info, even though it's open domain ... <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Blue/smile.png" alt="smile.png"></p>

              <p>Well done Lionnoisy on publicising the access details to the exercise.</p>
              <p>Just because the press release says it is a restricted area, doesn't mean there isn't any look out point.</p>
              <p>There are few public access areas where you can view the airbase runways.</p>
