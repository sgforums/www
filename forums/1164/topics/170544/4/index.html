            <div class='col-md body'>Hmm... i think if the Nimtz and the IJN see each other at the same time it will be a draw.<br><br>The Nimtz can strike quickly at all the Aircraft carrier and try retreating towards Pearl Harbour so as to alert the Navy.<br><br>In the end, maybe both fleets (most of the Jap Carriers + Nimtz) get destroyed, since the IJN had numerical superiorty, but the events that happened afterwards would never happen, right?<br><br>The US would have 100% of their Battleships and Carriers of WWII and the IJN would have lost more than 50% of their strike capability.<br><br>It would be a easy defense of the phillipines as MacAuthur's plan Orange would have succeded and Japan might had been brought to surrender sooner.</div>

You can even sink all the Jap carriers, yet their escort ships will chase the burning CVN down.

I don't deny this facts.. </div></blockquote>Pls check up all your fact first before you talk cock !!!<br><br>First you are totally wrong ! Watch movie also can see till so wrongly no wonder you got all you military facts also wrong !<br><br>Movie- final countdown - First in the movie japan fleet is was launch to attack pearl harbour , they never even know the CNV was ever there ! So how can you keep saying the jap fleet detected the CNV ? You change the script is it ?<br>Next the F-14s was ask to play with the zeros first, and  wait for command, that why they took their time (they did not have the shoot order yet), when the command was given the zero was instantly splashed.<br><br>See movie also don't know how to see come here talk cock ! go see your movie again than say. !<br><br>In real fact . A carrier can launch planes very fast . The 1985 Achille Lauro affair - more then 7 F-14s was launch to intercept a hijacked airliner.<br><br>Pls refer to howstuff works. When the crew is in full swing, it can launch or land a plane every 25 seconds -- that time the carrier have at least 30 x a-7 and 14 x F-14 .  At the rate of the slow speed of zeros, with CVN radar, the whole damn flight wing would have been up in the air already , 1/2 way waiting.<br><br>By the way A-7 is the replace for skyhawk for carriers , they have guns and capable of air to air .<br><br>For dumb folk sake, most zeros in are bombers and toperdo planes, they are fully load and not fly like what you dream of that type of zero interceptors.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Mobydog,<br><br>In real the CVN would not need to due with 300 planes at on shot, But only 1/2 of them, but 2 wave . That make the job more easier.<br><br>But if you chose to fly 300+ of them at once, you will be worshipped as the bloody military genius that destory 1/2 of japanese planes before they even reach the cvn. Because only a fool would ask planes at stay around burn up all the fuel waiting for number 300th planes to be in the air  to form formation.<br><br>That is why the jap commander was not u, and did the right thing, he launch his planes, when 1/2 of them is up they form the 1 wave and go. The rest  launch will form another wave , which is the 2nd wave. Note: from this history, notice that the 2nd wave is 1 hr behind the 1st wave, that is how much time it take to form a 100+ plane fomation !<br><br>7:55am - 1st wave of 183 Japanese planes led by Fuchida attack Pearl from NW<br>9:00am - 2nd wave of 167 Japanese planes led by Shimazaki attack Pearl from NE</div>

Now, if they had engaged with BVRAAMs, missiles that fly at mach 3-4, I don't think the Zeros stand a chance.<br><br>Second of all, the Nimitz has the element of surprise.  The IJN fleet didn't know where the nimitz was, but the nimitz knew where the IJN fleet was.  Even without radar, they still had their HISTORY books.<br><br>Third.  The Japanese fleet was targetting PEARL harbor.  They just had to send their Tomcats to splash the airborne fighters, preferably ONLY targetting their KATES and torpedo bombers.  A 2nd group consisting of strike fighters like the A-6 can fly in and target SPECIFICALLY the japanese carriers with STAND OFF missiles.<br><br>1 ONE blow, the IJN carriers would be OUT of commission, and many of their fighters shot down.<br><br>And what advantage does the Jet fighter have over the prop bird?  The ability turn and BURN.  If a jet finds a prop bird on his tail, or caught in a close knife fight, he can simply pull up, and punch his burners.   2 MOST important thing in air combat... ALTITUDE and AIRSPEED.  Both are to the tomcat's advantage.<br><br>But like i said... they wouldnt press in for a Dogfight in the first place.  The CVN's fighters would simply hang around at BVR and f-pole the jap fighters.  Out of AAMs?  Land, reload.<br><br>War-time / emergency operations would sometimes result in desperate measures, such as loading live ordinance and fuel into hot birds.</div>

And since they dont even need after burner to get off the deck.<br>Those old straight deck carriers launch planes in waves of like 20-40. Given the Japs had 6 carriers that's like 120-240 per wave. Given 1hr between waves it is pretty deadly. The CVN on it's on is a sitting duck. There aint enough fighters to go around.<br>Let's say 24 tomcats with 4 AIm-54's each. with a  failure rate of 1 in 8. That's a failure of what? 12 missles? The Aim-9's shld have a higher failure rate given the heat given out by the prop planes arent all that great. So i'll give 1 in 5. With 4 each plane that's 20 failures.<br>Throwing up the 24 A7's with say 6 sidewinders a piece. You get around 25 failures? Now you're not going to be able to put up every single fighter hence you'd be reduced to just a few. Let's say 50% up at anyone time.

            <div class='col-md body'>There can't be 300+ Zeroes in the Jap Carrier Force. There are probably 18 per carrier, considering their original mission was the attack of Pearl Harbor. They would probably carry more spares for their bomber and attack planes.<br><br>The Jap carrier group lack the radars of the Nimitz. This compromises their recon ability. To locate the Nimitz, they would have to send search planes for which they devote very little of their command towards. Their search ability is also restricted by the number of planes they put into the air. From Fuchida's account in Midway, he reveals that Jap command typically relegates the task of searching to float planes, preferring to keep their Zeros and other attack craft for more offensive purposes.<br><br>I think the bigger issue isn't the numbers game. It is first and foremost, the ability of opposing carrier group or carrier to locate the other first. The Nimitz stands the biggest chance to do this, as they have historical knowledge to back them up. The Jap Carrier Group is groping into the unknown, with regards to the Nimitz.<br><br></div>
