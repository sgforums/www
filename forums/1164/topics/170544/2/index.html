They nealy lost the ship, now imagine if it was a war time senario    </div></blockquote>This is the USS Forrestal fire.<br><br><strong>With the war in Southeast Asia providing experience for all phases of  naval operations, several carriers which normally belong to the Atlantic Fleet were occasionally routed to WESTPAC duty, and thus it was that on June 6, 1967, Forrestal left Norfolk, Virginia, for what was to be her first combat deployment.<br><br>Carrying Air Wing 17, Forrestal was the first U.S. carrier to be built from the keel up with an angled deck.  She carried East Coast squadrons, two F-4B squadrons squadrons; VFs 11 and 74; VAs 106 and 46, flying A-4Es; RVAH-11, with RA-5C Vigilantes, for which the big carrier had undergone major modification for the IOIC reconnaissance intelligence system; the KA-3Bs of VAH-10; and VAW-123, flying E-2As.<br><br>This is what is believed to be the last photo taken of the Forrestal on the morning of July 29, 1967<br><br>Forrestal arrived on Yankee Station on July 25 and immediately began combat operations, her aircraft flying 150 sorties during the next 4 days, without the loss of a single aircraft. At 10:52 A.M. on July 29, the second launch was being readied when a Zuni rocket accidentally fired from an F-4 Phantom parked on the starboard side of the flight deck aft of the island.  The missile streaked across the deck into a 400 gallon belly fuel tank on  a parked  A-4D Skyhawk.  The ruptured tank  spew highly flammable JP-5 fuel onto the deck which ignited spreading flames over the flight deck under other fully loaded aircraft ready for launch. The ensuing fire caused ordinance to explode and other rockets to ignite. Spread by the wind, the flames engulfed the aft end of the stricken ship turning the flight deck into a blazing inferno..  Berthing spaces immediately below the flight deck became death traps for fifty men, while other crewmen were blown overboard by the explosion.<br><br>Nearby ships hastened to the Forrestal's aid.  The Oriskany, herself a victim of a tragic fire in October 1966, stood by to offer fire-fighting and medical aid to the larger carrier.  Nearby escort vessels sprayed water on the burning Forrestal and within an hour the fire on the flight deck was under control.  But secondary fires below deck took another 12 hours to contain.  The damage and loss of life was catastrophic.<br><br>The four-and-a-half-acre flight deck was littered with pieces of aircraft, as men struggled to clear away bombs and ammunition, throwing the ordnance over the side.  One young 130-pound lieutenant found the strength to heave a 250-pound bomb overboard.</strong><br><br><img src="http://www.chinfo.navy.mil/navpalib/ships/carriers/histories/cv59-forrestal/cv59-fire01.jpg"><br><br><img src="http://www.chinfo.navy.mil/navpalib/ships/carriers/histories/cv59-forrestal/cv59-fire05.jpg"><br><br><img src="http://www.imagestation.com/picture/sraid79/pe9ddbbf6ee0ea3496c83ffa4039bfaa7/fb1e180a.jpg"><br><br><img src="http://www.imagestation.com/picture/sraid79/pd738da2caa4257d67567e6fd5670b36e/fb1e1806.jpg"><br><br><img src="http://navysite.de/cvn/cv59fire.jpg"></div>

THey gonna take many many many sorties before they could sink the monster.That's 90,000 tons of steel and a top notch damage control crew.</blockquote>First, WWII carriers can easily launched a prepared flight of 20 prop-fighters in under 10 mins. In contrast, Enterprise CVN could only do so.. with at most 6-8, in the same senario. Japs could launch their entire strike squadron in just 35 mins. They consist of bombers, fighter bombers and torpedo strike bombers<br><br>In any case, I have already state the the CVN will win. Why, The modern CVN has radars, with E2C thrown in, they can detect the Jap fleet 180 km away. And as stated by another Poster, they knew the plan. Enough time to launch an entire air Cap and strike sorties.<br><br>Now, If the senario, were that they detected each other at the same time, with the CVN having only basic cap of 2. Then I would say, CVN is ikely doomed.<br><br>Well, you see, the Jap had 348 number of planes with they can launch in 45 mins- 1 hr, while given the same time, I est only about 38,( thats the total fighter wing available, in fact the deck could not hold that many).<br><br>Now, todays Carriers are not so much different in design as those of WWII. We know the The Yorktown was sink with just a few bomb hits, it was their fuel and munition that actually sink them. We must understand the Japs also have torpedoes planes, the sidewinders were not so effective on sea expanse environment, as shown in vietnam war, they only have a 70% hit ratio, which critically deterioate at sea deck ( due to acquired radar limitation) we are talking about technologies in the 70s. and CIWS phanllx were not available then.<br><br>There are simply too many zeros in the air. SM1,2,3 are non existence then, even they exist, there are no supporting ships, harpoons are thereby moot. I couldn't even see air-launch harpoons being able to be deployed, given this senario.<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Nimitz vs 1st Koku Kantai? My money is on the Nimitz. Using the The Final Countdown scenario, I agree that Nimitz has advantage in knowing the location, strength and attack routes. Regarding the hardware, well, 24 Tomcats with 6 AAMS each plus the Corsairs which can carry at least 2 AAMs plus their Vulcan cannons could make mincemeat out of the strike force. Sure, there are more Zeroes but as has been shown in actual combat, the key to avoid being second best to a Zero is by avoiding maneuvring dogfights and concentrating more on slashing attacks. Something the Tomcats and Corsairs could do considering the massive speed advantage they have.<br><br>Reagarding attacking the ships of the Japanese fleet...the Nimitz can use everything from dumb Mk82s to Harpoons to kill the ships. Also one thing that have to be rembered, there were less AA weapons on the Japanese ships in 1941 than in 1944.<br><br>If the escorts are also whisked to 1941, well there would be more Harpoons wouldn't it?</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>the nimitz will win hands down.<br><br>Because in the old days, they form wings formation to fly to attack. Just send a few tomcats to go super-sonic past them, fire some shots these will break up the formation totally.  Keep breaking up the formation and force them lower to sea level. The jap planes never have enough fuel get even near Nimitz or return to their carrier.<br><br>As for the Jap ship. Without their planes they are sitting ducks. Send harpoons to knock them out. Well you just have to serious damage them, which will disable most weapons, then you can slowly take them out.<br></div>

The problem with 2nd world war planes is once you force them down , they take too much fuel and time to regain attiude. This totally screw up their fuel which will run out very fast.<br><br>By the way go check out how many bombs and torpedeos sink the yamato, or the bismark ! May be armoured but when hit, they still sink.<br><br>You cannot compare a unladen LPH which has modern design compartation to contain damages. Carriers are full of fuels and bombs !<br><br>1st thing, why must you go to take out the battleships. You just need to take out the carriers which are not that armoured. You just need to hit a magzine or two and let them burn. You just have to follow the fleet which cannot outrun you and keep hitting them till they sink.<br><br></div>
