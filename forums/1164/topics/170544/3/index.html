The F-14 achieved those range because of speed. Their loitering time is in fact very low.<br><br><blockquote>You just need 2 pairs to break up the formations, force them down to lower attiude, when they are closer, you can alway launch another 2 pair to take over. The problem with 2nd world war planes is once you force them down , they take too much fuel and time to regain attiude. This totally screw up their fuel which will run out very fast.</blockquote>as above.<br><br><blockquote>By the way go check out how many bombs and torpedeos sink the yamato, or the bismark ! May be armoured but when hit, they still sink. </blockquote>For the Dismarck, a luckly torpedo diabled the steering flab.<br><br><blockquote>You cannot compare a unladen LPH which has modern design compartation to contain damages. Carriers are full of fuels and bombs ! </blockquote>I agree (check my earlier post), but I said this just for info<br><br><blockquote>1st thing, why must you go to take out the battleships. You just need to take out the carriers which are not that armoured. You just need to hit a magzine or two and let them burn. You just have to follow the fleet which cannot outrun you and keep hitting them till they sink. </blockquote>Because, you said Jap ships. The CVN has no fore-cannon, thus, how the hell can the fleet put run a fighter-bomber.<br></div>

The Zeros are, in fact, about slightly less than half the speed of the F14. They can reach the CVN. 30 knots to any aircraft is minute. If the CVN are not at designated, then they would be still be at visible distance. Torpedoes avoidance is possible off-course, but you will launch at intercept way point - that is infront of it. CVN are huge ships the need more than afew hundred meters to stop and turns slow.</div>

How many F-14s can you launch within the given period.. even with 15 mins on station whisking up and down.. how many Zeros can you down ? This tactic will spread out the zeros, thereby require at bigger combat radius by each fly pass. You are neglecting that at every fly-bys, the Zeros are closer to the CVNs.<br><br><blockquote><strong>30 knots at 15 mintue would have move the CNV out of way of the zeros .

Zeros do not have Radars. How many miles does a CVN travels in 15 mins ? They will still be within visual range.. do some calculation yrself.

            <div class='col-md body'>Wah... like that, think RSAF no need to spend so much on the latest F16s, F15s lar. Get some current turboprops can liao. or maybe buy the design of the zeros and the license to produce them from mutsubitsu lar. Yea, think also ask them for the blueprint of the mighty WWII carriers  and escorts too.  Think the japs are willing to sell them to us by now and maybe rolling on the floor laughing to death. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Wa Lan ..aaaa.   Please consider the scenario...<br><br>1) The lone 1970S CVN and 1941 Jap fleet detect each other at the same time.<br><br>2) There are 300+ zeros in the air vs less than about gradual increase of about 30 F-14 in an hour.<br><br>3) Each F-14 has Max 4 AMRAAMS, 4 sidewider each.<br><br>If you have seen the Movie " Final countdown" you will notice that the two F-14 took about 5 to 10 mins to shoot down 2 Zeros. The Zeros have better Maneuverabilities and were shot down with 1 sidewinder and the other with cannon.<br><br><blockquote>U think the CVN captain won't know that Speed, Technology, and Range is on their side and use it to the best of their advantage? </blockquote>Of course they do... they are technologically more advance.. but there is substance in quantity vs quality. Flying in congested airspace leads to collisions and lucky shots etc. The Japs simply have to get afew bombs onto the deck of the CVN.. and its mission killed.. is sunk. OR long enough for their estroyers 16" guns with 40 mile range to pound the CVN. The CVN can outrun them, but the Jap fighters can reload at any of the 6 carriers and torpedo the CVN. You can even sink all the Jap carriers, yet their escort ships will chase the burning CVN down. BTW, WWII ships are very armoured, it takes many harpoons to sink one, if you can launch any or have any left or any platform to launch them, since you can't launch aircraft from a burning CVN.<br><br>Note : Under normal circumstances, the CVN with advance radar and weapons will win. I don't deny this facts..</div>
