Yes.The maximum range of this ASM is round 60-70nm.Of course they would try to launch them nearer,say 40-50nm to increase the chances of a hit.IJN CAP patrols were usually positioned very close to the main body of carriers.Around 10-20nm.Hence,the Zeros would not have the chance of seeing what hit their mother ships.Furthermore,the Zero(maximum speed=300+ knots) was too slow to catch up with a Harpoon(cruising speed=650 knots),let alone shoot it down. When the Harpoons were inbound,the Jap ships would try to evade but in vain because the Harpoons were radar guided.<br><br>Another point you mentioned is that the Nimitz would run out of ammo before the Jap task force was totally destroyed. Impossible.Even without Harpoons,there were still countless bombs-laser guided and dumb alike.And you stated that the Jap task force would chase after the Nimitz. The Nimitz is a huge ship but she is no slow snail. She is capable of 35 knots.Yes,the Jap task force without the carriers and battleships was also capable of that speed,but do they have the endurance? The Nimitz is nuclear powered mind you.Do you know she can cruise for 13 years straight without "refuelling"?</div>

Now let's dissect this assertion.The Zero is much more agile.But it has only 2 7.7m MGs and 2 20mm cannons.The tactic of the Zero is to use its 7.7mm MGs to weaken its opponent first before closing in to deliver the knock out blow with its 20mm.Now can 7.7mm seriously damage the F-14? Furthermore,even if a Tomcat faces 10 Zeros,he don't need to give battle.The pilot just need to go to afterburner and his plane would swoosh away at Mach 2+.<br><br>Anyway,I don't think the Nimitz strike package would want to make its presence known by destroying the Zeros.They would fly to 40-50nm away,launch their Harpoons and then fu-ck off.</div>

She is capable of 35 knots.Yes,the Jap task force without the carriers and battleships was also capable of that speed,but do they have the endurance?[b] The Nimitz is nuclear powered mind you.Do you know she can cruise for 13 years straight without "refuelling"?[/</strong>b]</blockquote>Despite nuclear carrier can cruise 13yrs without refueling...Can it carry enough food for 5000 people for 13 yrs?

            <div class='col-md body'>Firstly, there is obviously no contest Nimizt CVN group will sure win.<br><br>The F-14 will only need to fly Mach 2+ into the Zero's formation or near them, and the turbulence will put them out of control. Harpoons will definately mission kill all the Japs ships, in which they have no defense against. Then slowly use A2A(possible) , PGMs to pick them off one by one... no contest.<br><br>Anyway, CVN are over-rated by some. Without replenishing ships, CVN by themselves wil have only 24 hrs worth of munition capabalities as shown in the serbian conflict, in a full assualt senario. On top of that, only 100+ strike sorties were achiveable in a day. They were able to launch a full strike team, but must remember that they have to be retrieve, and needs half an hour to reload and refuel and relaunch. You can't have many planes circulating to land, as they are fuel gustlers. and limited deck space for launching and landings. Doing this end to end with only about 50 m of free space in between.<br><br>But afew zeros will get thru, because there are simply too many zeros, and modern ships nowadays do not have AA guns clustered everywhere, only 4 CIWS at each corner of the CVN, with about 2,000 rounds each. even with evolved Sparrow RAM, how many can they shoot down - at most 21.  afew will get thru... should one be able to drop a load on the deck and ignite JP5, well then Considered the CVN mission killed and their planes still in the sky, will be ditch, when out of fuel.<br><br>I say this is because, in the late 60's, a fire from the deck of an aircraft carrier nearly scuttled it, due to an accident where it caused a bomb to explode and ignite the fuel JP5 and spread below deck, inturn igniting other planes. more the 38 planes were destroyed, and each place have a basic load of JP5. They nealy lost the ship, now imagine if it was a war time senario</div>
