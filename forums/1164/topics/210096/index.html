Yes, we are a citizen's army &amp; every man counts.  Indeed, many of these obese folks do contribute be it as storemen or clerks.

These guys maybe obese, but they still serve their 2 years.  Its SAF that needs to wake up and start providing properly sized uniforms.  U think obese people like to walk around in No.4 thats obviously too tight for them?</div>

"XXXL" is not a SF horror<br><br>Basically every male should serve NS, even the weakest should be given a chance to 'do their part'; leaving one person out just because we cannot find a role was never a consideration (not should it ever be).<br><br>I've got a friend who was 140kg (Cat C3) being storeman at GEB, someone  who is was leaglly blind in one eye but eventually went on to Oxford to do maths, why deny them the honour to do NS, just beacuse of narrow perception of fighting fit means filling a medium size No 4?<br><br>so what if you are fit physically, are you mentally tough?</div>
