The answer is simple: The Malaysian Navy is already beginning the process of training personnel for the submarines, which are still under construction. This is an approach that will help the Malaysians hit the ground running once the first of the Scorpene-class submarines arrive.<br><br>The Scorpene is a modern French-Spanish diesel-electric submarine (a variant uses air-independent propulsion) that displaces 1700 tons, has a top speed in excess of 37 kilometers per hour, and is armed with six 21-inch torpedo tubes with eighteen torpedoes or SM.39 Exocet anti-ship missiles. Malaysia is acquiring two of these vessels, each of which requires a crew of 30.<br><br>So, Malaysia only has to train 60 sailors, right? Wrong. Malaysia is going to need a deeper pool, for a number of reasons. Some crewmen will not want to make the navy a career. Others will get sick or injured in the course of peacetime operations and have to be discharged. Other people just won't make the grade, or will develop claustrophobia. Submarine duty is very difficult, and a constant stream of well-trained personnel is necessary. Otherwise, Malaysia's new submarine force is little more than a money pit.<br><br>The way Malaysia is doing this is through classroom training, and the use of an older Agosta-class submarine as a "school". The Agosta displaces 1500 tons, has a top speed of 37 kilometers per hour, and is has four 21-inch torpedo tubes that can fire torpedoes or Exocet anti-ship missiles. The real benefit to the Agosta as a training vessel is the fact that it has a complement of 58, nearly twice that of the Scorpene. Despite being first commissioned in 1974, the Agosta is still a capable submarine, and is in service with Spain and Pakistan.<br><br>Ultimately, the effectiveness of Malaysia's new submarines will depend on how well they train their personnel. If the training provides good crews for the submarines, then Malaysia will be in a good position to defend its interests. If it doesn'tÂ… Malaysia has two submersible white elephants. Â– Harold C.

After that, we'll do it ourselves," he said.<br><br>On another matter, Ilyas said the navy would decide whether or not it would bring back the Agosta-class submarine it acquired for sea training of Malaysian submariners in Brest by year-end.<br><br>He said the navy was conducting a study on the feasibility of bringing back the "OUESSANT", the overhauled ex-French navy submarine which was decommissioned in 2003.<br><br><strong><span style="color: red;">"We may bring it back but perhaps not for operational use as the Agosta only has a lifespan of five years (after an overhaul) and that is just enough to train our men.</span></strong><br><br>"Even if we decide to operate it upon bringing it home, it will be too costly," he said.<br><br>It would also be expensive to bring it back as a historical piece as it would be too complicated to de-assemble for transportation, re-assemble in Malaysia and maintain it, he added.<br><br>-- BERNAMA<br></div>
