              Continuation of a topic that got locked. No idea why though, but Ah gong asked if DART was considered SF.
              
              I'd say no. DART (Disaster and Rescue) are civil defence rescue units not military units. Our SF would be something like the SOF (Special Ops Forces) , UDT (Underwater Demolitions) and maybe the STAR (Special Tactics And Response) teams. The ADF (Advance Defence Force) might also be edging along the SF lines, but I'm not too sure about them, the ADF concept came up after I finished NS.

              <p>Two points I noticed:</p>
              <p>You did not describe the Commandos as an SF element.</p>
              <p>ADF- I've heard something very different about ADF: that it stands for "Army Development Force" and evaluates new Army weapons and concepts. Quite distant from an SF role. But my source could be wrong.</p>

              You could be right, my info on the ADF is very sparse and sketchy, I was long out even before the concept came about, so not too familiar with it.
              
              And the CDOs are... well... the NSF side, I'd call them bludgeons rather than SF. They act more like heavy assault troops than infiltration/special ops units. If anything, they're more like our version of the Marines, just airborne. In fact, there are similarities, like the fact that a CDO unit is ~25% overstrength compared to it's equivalent army unit in other formations, probably to be able to take more casualties, same as the Marine vs Army units in the US.

              lol I know of the "rep". It used to bug the batches before my time, I heard the lao jiao used to go pick fights with them. :P Friendly fights and teasing, but honestly, they don't break into small enough units to be sneaking around, they still move as platoon sized chunks and never break out of constant contact with higher command. (Make that platoon + size, they ARE overstrength on a per unit basis after all.)
                  
              There are always exceptions to the rule though. Exception in this case is the Commando LURPS. We're on much better terms with the LURPS than the rest of the "horny and gory" guys :P

              <p>watch the movie yesterday, ok lah quite touching only 2 out of 6 men survived the rescue attempt...wonder why there's no backup with all the high tech satellite and drones out there?</p>
              <p>The french SF is  good too remind me of legionaires, war is never pleasant you lose lives and in the end you lose your  belief in the goodness of our world  for those that survived.</p>
              <p>One thing I find refreshing is there's no machoism or personal heroism ...all of them just trying to do their jobs and get out...no hollywood glamourisng military life</p>

              <p>Bearzais, the Guards are more lightly equipped than the infantry. They are highly mobile, amphibious/airborne, flank screeners.</p>
              <p>From what little I know about the Commandos, they do practice unconventional small unit tactics. A platoon is not a large force for most missions.multiple platoons.</p>
              <p>What I understand is NSF Commandos are 100% raiders. The SF which carry out missions such as lasing are all regulars. If you go to Sheares on any given day, you will catch a glimpse of them before long, they're always buying their specialist gear.</p>

              Do agree on the unconventional small unit ops, but for the most part, it's sabotage and assault, the real SF teams tend to work with 4-8 men teams, not 35+ men platoons and their ops are more fire support and recce/survey than storm the trenches missions. 
              
              Even the SF assault jobs like hostage rescue don't use 35 men in an assault, more like a max of ~16 men minus support on the entry (4 fireteams).

              S.H may be right, I'm not too sure about ADF since they're fairly new.
              
              But I can safely guess one thing.
              
              ADF is about as pro-defence as the SAS is pro-aircraft. :P lol

              They're not secretive, just not talked about much.    
              I don't think ADF really is hard core SF, they're more like pathfinders etc.

              <p>Do agree on the unconventional small unit ops, but for the most
              part, it’s sabotage and assault, the real SF teams tend to work
              with 4-8 men teams, not 35+ men platoons and their ops are more
              fire support and recce/survey than storm the trenches missions.</p>
              <p>Even the SF assault jobs like hostage rescue don’t use 35 men in
              an assault, more like a max of ~16 men minus support on the entry
              (4 fireteams).</p>

              lol I like recce. Once you're out of your OC's sight, deploy hammock. :P
              
              Besides, recce can be fun once in a while, you get to use all the nice stuff like TI, NVGs, ground sensors, and call in air/arty strikes.
              
              Beats running up and down a hill screaming your lungs out lol.
              
              Back to ADF, you think there could actually be two ADFs? One a testing unit, the other an advance deployment force? Sneaky.
              
              As for Marines, our closest analog really would be the CDOs.

              <p>Assaulting BUA can actually be fun (sometimes). Attacking hills with dug in positions sucks. Getting there sucks even more.</p>
              <p>Which is why I envy those in jungle hats. Even though they insert earlier, they have a lot of freedom.</p>

              <p>Gds and Inf are very similar. Just that guards are trained in heli rappelling and have LSVs. Their weapon systems are the same. Neither are what I'd call "heavy infantry". I'll use that term for the Armored Inf because, well, they have a damn APC while the gds/inf have ... their SBOs.</p>
              <p>Cdos appear, raid/sabotage, and exit. They don't hold ground.</p>
