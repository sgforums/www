You need a location for resupply, otherwise you'll soon be shooting the universal round and eating snake for real, not to mention no person can actually keep hiking for 72 hrs straight with an extra heavy pack. Rubber legs when contacted isn't a good thing. Blundering around in enemy territory actually also increases the risk of hitting an ambush, better to find a defendable location and rest for a bit.</div>

              <p>I realise these questions will not get answered, but no harm asking right.</p>
              <p>Is ADF a line unit or evaluation unit or both?</p>
              <p>What is the size of ADF units? eg companies</p>

              True, which is why I call NSF CDOs bludgeons rather than SF.
                  
              No idea on ADF size or job scope, but I can confirm it's not brigade asset or lower, so it'll be division and above, and even so, which division? It screws up standard structure, so my bet is that it's a GHQ level asset.
              
              Wait, just remembered something, it may not even be a unit at all but groups of scattered experienced personnel. My last in-camp, my 2IC was ADF, but he was posted to my unit instead of a dedicated ADF unit. Maybe ADF really isn't a unit but a designation, like SOF personnel posted to be CSM of other units, but when activated, goes back to parent unit?

              TI also needs to shrink down, if they can. Current ones are... well, remember Halo 2 when they 1st landed in New Mombassa on Earth? The sniper team spotter talking to them was using a TI unit. It's fairly bulky. And noisy (cooling fan). And needs time to warm up.

              Won't be adverse to changing all the straight legs to mechanised infantry though.

              Wiki is your friend...
              
              Long story short, think Stryker's big brother.

              <p>Hey man, interesting stuff from wiki:</p>
              <p>The Singapore Armed Forces will acquire at least 135 Terrex ICVs to replace its V-200 armoured vehicles, with<strong> all active infantry and Guards battalions </strong>to begin training to operate from the vehicle in February 2010. The Second Battalion, Singapore Infantry Regiment, recently acquired the Terrex as part of its shift into a motorised infantry battalion.</p>
              <p>The <strong>Indonesian Army has plans to purchase 420 units</strong> and has also expressed intent to produce the Terrex locally under license. Turkish automaker Otokar has also joined with ST Kinetics to produce the Terrex AV-82 (renamed Yavuz) for the Turkish Armed Forces.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I too agree with widely fielding the Terrex. Seen the body armor, goggles, NVGs, search lights, round corner firing 
                      devices and thrown sensors that equip them nowadays? In any case, tonners don't cut it even for moving around in one piece anymore.</p>
              <p>The figure of &gt;135 vehicles is definitely insufficient to fully equip all infantry battalions, even just NSF ones. Either a battalion will be partially equipped with Terrex, or some battalions will not be motorised (6, 8, 9 SIR = POI battalions) or both.</p>
              <p>Anyway, SAF chooses to call them "<span style="text-decoration: underline;">motorized</span> infantry" and it's an "Infantry <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Carrier</span> Vehicle".</p>

              <p>SAF has been diversifying in unit and platform types and will continue to do so.</p>
              <p>As NSFs are channeled to fill these new units, and with falling birth rates, fewer may serve in Infantry. SAF may have to rely on reservists till older age to fill Infantry jobs hence the Terrex may be useful.</p>
              <p>Maybe our reservist obligations will be extended one day?</p>
