            <div class='col-md body'>Hey Hellfire,<br><br>There may be more opportunities around the world but SIngapore will always be home.  I like being a chinese and like seeing chinese people around.  You never feel like a minority in SIngapore.  I am currently working and the only chinese in the office.  Sometimes it can be a little intimidating.  I have also always had Malysian friends thus stay close to my own people.  I guess I also like the hustle and bustle of Singapore.  Although things are not as affordable in SIngapore or the sales people at lucky plaza are rude asses who don't know how to sell.  I will still always feel happier in Singapore.<br><br>Australia has been an eye opener but never home I guess.  I am going to give it another try, nothing to lose anyway.</div>

Open an offshore BVI company in your name (one director enough)<br>2. Use the BVI company to open a bank account in Hong Kong<br>3. Work for your father as per normal but not under employee "name", merely as providing consultancy services to his company.<br>4. Collect your pay using your BVI company in Hong Kong.<br>5. When your visa is up, go to JB to get a renewal every 3 months.<br>6. This way, you dont pay Spore income tax, you dont pay HK income tax (because it is territorial based), you dont pay CPF.<br><br>Problem solved, everyone happy...one think lacking in most Sporean and ang moh is that you all dont know how to play dirty.</div>
