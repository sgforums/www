            <div class='col-md body'>Hello Everyone,<br><br>I am new here and just wanted some opinions.  I am a ex-singaporean.  I did not serve NS and left Singapore when I was 8.  I am now considering serving NS because I desparately miss Singapore and I cannot work there anymore because of not serving NS.  I can go there for holiday but not work.  I am going to be turning 26 next month and feel too old to serve NS.  Also I have a career in IT at the moment which I feel that if I quit to serve may ruin my career.<br><br>Do you guys know anyone who is that old and gone back to Singapore to serve NS.  I did not serve NS because I was in the middle of University in Melbourne and they would not let me extend my leave for NS until I finished Uni thus I had to renounce my Singapore Citizenship.  My younger brother just went in to serve about 1 and a half years ago.  He went in at 22  He was also in the same boat as me, he renounced but they gave him back citizenship after he signed up for NS..<br><br>I really don't know what to do.  No matter where I am in the world, Singapore always feels like home to me and it really sux not being able to work there.<br><br>Sorry for the long message but any opinions will appreciated.</div>
