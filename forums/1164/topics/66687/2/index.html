But for my generation (30s) you can expect the facial expression when you tell someone you are a regular in the army. And you cant really say how "glam" your job is because it has to be a secret. So, the only cues you can give is your rank. Imagine, when you are in your 30s and you tell someone you are CPT and below, ha! They will think: "must be condemn one la". Noticed the difference when US soldiers wear their uniform everywhere, even when they go to a pub? Then think of the SAF guy. Cant bloody wait to peel the greens off and wear civilian when book out. There you have it.</div>

If I dont need a passport + not a 1st class degree holder or scholar or high tech trained or engineer, I wouldnt even think about going back. I am in Shanghai now, and the only reason I am here is that I BELIEVE that I can make my own pot of gold here. I have already made up my mind to live here because I want to take part in its boom and get good returns in the process, to live and not just to stay alive. Essentially, I am Ah Beng in my heart and dont really care if the ppl around me are "Cheena" or not.</div>

The govt decide.<br><br>If you want to sign on as career soldier, it's 6 years. But you can break the contract after 5 years. 2.5 years is only for NS. If you choose to sign on, you can choose your career path. Example, you apply to be an Air Force technician or a signal specialist with the Army. You need not indicate your choice up front. You can decide during your BMT. During your BMT, you'll be able to make a better choice.<br><br>I'm from IT as well. I know of ex-Army guys who sign on as signal specialists and subsequently became managers with Alcatel. So, it depends on what IT specialisation you're in.<br><br>Please remember that if you serve half way and decide to quit, you'll be treated as a deserter. You can forget about coming back to Singapore forever because you'll end up in jail. This is worse than you not serving NS in the first place.<br><br>Physical fitness: running is very important. Do it as often as you can. Run  5km regularly and you should be fine.</div>

I do 1st and 2nd level desktop support so it is not really anything special such as systems development.  But I just don't want to become obsolete in the work force.
