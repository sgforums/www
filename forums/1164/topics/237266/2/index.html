            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by huaichien:</div><div class="quote_body">I'm sure there have been many crew and technicians who have operated and worked on the Centurion all these years. Were all of them swore to secrecy not to talk about it and every single one actually did kept to the silence?</div></blockquote>I don't know if there was actually a swearing ceremony for alleged Centurion crews. It is not as if you are talking to a small group of special secret operatives. These are NSmen, and very, very many of them, to boot.<br><br>SAF is not so naive as to really have expected them to keep quiet for life. I think there will be a breach of law only if you start passing photographic evidence etc around to the press or something.  Or if you start pinpointing where these things are located etc. If I go on to Orchard Road with a placard that says SAF HAS CENTURIONS I think I will not be prosecuted for anything other than being a nut job.<br><br>Besides, the reason for denying the existence was not because the Centurion was a super duper space laser or something. It was merely because we want to be able to deny its existence should our neighbours complain.<br><br>It's a bit like the existence of the SOF during the eighties.<br><br>While the SAF then will deny that they exist, they are also quite happy that the secret "leaked out". It's one off those things that you would like others to know about but not confirm or deny suspicions to keep people guessing.<br><br>It's all part of warfare.<br><br>Another example is training in ROC. Hundreds of thousands of Ah Beng Ah Seng have been there and back, yet it is supposed to be secret. Why? Just to avoid a potentially embarrassing situation with China. But you can bet your last dollar that China knows and a agreement had been reached where they understand we are not helping ROC's military. So everybody is comfortable with the farce.<br><br>As I have mentioned many times before, I had an uncle from armour who told me that during the late seventies he was a Centurion crew. Either he was telling the truth, or SAF had devised a very elaborate bluff that involves SAF members like my uncle continuing to spread this Centurion "myth".<br><br>If the latter was true, then I am doing my bit for the country to continue perpetuating this myth.<br><br>Until now, none of us has seen a picture or the SAF Centurion. So for all you know, it may really be an elaborate lie!<br><br>This uncle was actually my brother-in-law's younger brother. After my sister and her husband separated, I no longer have access to verify this with that uncle.<br><br>Besides this uncle, I also have an older brother (passed on) that was a Vehicle Commander of a M113 track in the seventies. His vehicle was the original M113 with no mods and it mounted a M2 Browning with no shield or turret.<br><br>But both he and that uncle were black beret men.</div>

And I am sure it is still functioning. I do not know how it performance against PT91 but against APC or other light tank it is still useful.<br><br>the fact that we are still using AMX 13. that is old enough.</div>
