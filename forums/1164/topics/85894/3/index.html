            <div class='col-md body'>Peninsular Malaysia is many hundreds of times bigger than Singapore. Now add to this land mass the territories of Sabah and Sarawak. And then think of the borders they share with Thailand, Indonesia, Brunei, Singapore and Philippines - all of whom at one time or another were hostile to Malaysia. Thinkof all the thousands of miles of coastline, land, sea and airspace they have to defend.<br><br>And then compare little Singapore to that.<br><br>Should it be surprising that Malaysia needs a much, much bigger armed forces than us? And yet, the truth is opposite: Singapore has a much bigger and modern armed forces than Malaysia.<br><br>So it should not surprise anyone that they NEED to address this imbalance not because they want to invade us, but quite simply, Malaysia is a big juicy piece of poorly-defended meat.<br><br>The only thing going for them is that there are no real foreign threats - for now. But there are always the threat of internal rebellion etc. And even for that, they would need more equipment to be effective.<br><br>Many countries do not maintain a large armed forces during peacetime but have the ability to mobilise large numbers of both men and material quickly during emergency. Malaysia does not. One of its problems is that the ethnic Chinese Malaysians do not normally join their army. But the total ethnic Chinese population in Malaysia is about 45%. In terms of material, that's the problem they are now trying to address.<br><br>But even in their procurement programs someone here pointed out rightly that they seem to be buying randomly and have a mad variety of equipment. And they also have only a few token pieces of each weapon. So it seems they are out to put on a show. If you just look at the variety of weapons they have or are going to purchase, it seems like... WOW!!! And then you find they have merely 20 pieces of this, 40 pieces of that etc.<br><br>Whereas Singapore seems to buy in bulk. We have mainly the F-16 for now but I think we have 50 or more of them? We don't even have enough airspace for this many aircrafts. And our AMX-13s - small little buggers compared to their 50 PT-91 but hey - we have 300 of them. We apparently also have 100 Centurions. And it goes on...<br><br>Even in terms of manpower in the military, we easily outnumber them 3 to 1.<br><br>So who started the arms race?<br><br>I think Singapore is doing a good job of being the "poison shrimp" by being so well-armed. We must be the most heavily-defended piece of real estate on earth. Maybe even the DMZ in Korea has less troops and weapons.<br><br>We are bristling with weapons and live on an overcrowded island. And we Singaporeans are a rather cocky and aggressive lot, let's be honest. This combination cannot be something Malaysia feels secure about.<br><br>Although I am not saying their armed forces is a write-off, we should not view their weapons procurement as a threat meant specifically for us. It is really a deterrent against us and their other neighbours.<br><br>So relax, no need for paranoia for the ones sleeping badly at night should be our neighbours, not us.<br><br>Underneath all their recent bravado - what the Malaysians are hiding is the fact that they are woefully underarmed for too long. Seeing the near disintegration of Indonesia recently and its humiliation in Timor must be a wakeup call for them.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>*slowly claps* "overwhelm with aerial power instead of tanks" you sound like you're ready to skip OCS altogether and head straight to SCSC instead.

SBSK, when will you be enlisting?

His tanks and artilieries do not need to be refuel or supply with ammo by the supply trucks, he have unlimited ammos and fuels. He also looking from the whole area from birdeye view in game, so click and use artilieries and hit enemy, he does not need someone with laser designator to mark the target.<br><br>Forgot about it, he is giving dumb ideals all based on his games.
