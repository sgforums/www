            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by Rachmaninoff:</div><div class="quote_body">well, that's precisely what i've been trying to put across - that the perceptions of threat arising from our identification of the boundaries of the "self" in relation to the "other" are constructed via the intersubjective social relations.<br><br>To put it simply, once we stop thinking of the Malaysians as our enemy, and they do likewise - a reconstitution of the culture characterising our relations would occur. A case in point would be Egypt and Israel who have transformed their relations from that of a Hobbesian culture of perpetual war to a Lockeian culture of mutual respect following the Camp David accords</div></blockquote>I gotta admit that there's some truth to that, even though I'm a positivist.<br><br>With regards to your first point regarding the the source of the "culture of insecurity," one could also argue that Singapore was initially an enthusiastic member of the Federation, in which Singapore's leaders proclaimed at the time that the separation of both states would be detrimental to either side. The main cause of spearation lies not in the structure of the federation, but also, the policies that determined where Singapore would stand in the federation. As such, the latter would stand to lose out in a Malaysian-dominated federation, since the practice of aboriginal affirmative action policies was in direct conflict with the practice of meritocracy.<br><br>We may also go further and argue that the identity created is a product of the underlying circumstances of how Singapore was evicted from the federation and the conditions that faced the city-state thereafter in its formative years. That is to say, the water securitization issue came about because one party employed it as a political bargaining tool, to which the other party has to respond. In this regard, the socially-constructed identity between SG-Malaysia comes about as a product of <span style="font-style: italic;">realpolitik</span> issuses that has shaped it.<br><br>Singapore's response to its removal from the Federation is only rational, given its circumstances and conditions that prevailed at the time. The alternative scenario to the city state's "competitiveness and exceptionalism" in its foreign policy would be to merely remain a separate state in name, while having its foreign policy dictated by its larger neighbours.<br><br>Secondly, the reduction of Singapore's dependency on Malaysian water may on the one hand reduce its sense of vulnerability, but the country's geographical disdvantage remains. Therefore, the desecuritization of the water issue does not necessarily reduce its vulnerability in other areas. It merely lowers the odds that SG faces.<br><br>While it is unlikely that relations between both states would deteriorate to the extent that an interstate war would take place, the existence of mutual deterrence has helped maintain rationality in its bilateral relations.<br><br>It is promising however, given the recent changes in state leaders in both states, and the new commitment to improving bilateral relations.<br><br>***The case of comparing Israel and Egypt may not be accurate however. The Camp David Accords came about after the latter state finally acknowledge that the state of Israel was here to stay. In other words, it was after having been defeated by Israel in two wars that Egypt was willing to recognize Israel as a state (classic case of "if you can't beat 'em, join 'em"?). Again, what would have been the alternative scenario, had the Egyptians (and Syrians) won? The accords thus, was a product of a win-lose situation at that time.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>--------------------------DAY 2----------------------------------------------<br><br>What i did was simple, cause my units were tired and most of the tanks<br>were damaged, repairing of it takes quite some time , so i activate my reserve<br>troops to protect them, meanwhile doing aircrafts strikes<br><br>Navy in day 1 , i used mainly armoured hovercrafts to strike them<br>taking note that their navy aren't really built up.<br><br>So what i did was to equip myself with those Tomahawk kind of long range cruise missiles and escort them with subs and air cover again bypassing and with a longer ranger , i pounded them heavily with missiles.<br><br>Noting that resources and missiles are pretty scarced<br>i fired tomahawks at key installations again . Enemy fighters established contact and tried to intercept my fighter jets , thankfully with good anti aircraft defenses managed to shot down a few.<br><br>------------------------DAY 3--------------------------------------------------<br><br>Gathered all my stealth troops and special forces which requires alot of people to train , placed apaches and commanches together ,<br>stealth helicopters inside put with commandos which can blow buildings<br>Conduct night time bombing and evaded enemy radar installations.<br>The capital is heavily fortified (i know) so i used my commando to breach the area.<br><br>Fought a pretty heavy battle and enemy reinforcements arrived, was pretty shocked then , but commandos use hand equipped Dragon TOW launchers<br>and strike vehicles which was being carried Chinooks to destroy the armor,<br>the enemy tanks are arriving also from the further bases.<br><br>Immediately stormed parliament house and captured the key leaders<br>Airlift all out to a safe location , stormed key government residences and killed alot of the guards.<br><br>--------------------DAY 4--------------------------------------------------------<br><br>Enemy were launching a full force attack at us and were massing up at many locations, did a pre-emptive strike after spy plane spotted it, laid some booby traps while they were advancing, knew that my troops was injured in day 1 and commandos and air force and navy all fully used.<br><br>Enemy 50km away<br>I unleashed my armor corps including IFV,MBT and Artilery and rocket launchers , Artillery pounded key positions meanwhile aircraft cover it and the artilery is hidden under a ground with some camoflage.<br><br>Enemy navy , planning a counter attack launched surprise sub force from other side of where my naval bases were concerntrated, down some of my ships, had the Fokker-50 Aircraft to drop sonar buoys and destroy them using torpedos + depth charges<br><br>Leader-Held them hostage til they officially surrender<br>Enemy declared "War Over" , due to the capture of key leaders troop morale were down.<br><br>I took out a can of coke,and drank it..yummy!<br><br>--Sign treaty-- with the enemy forces and become friends again<br><br><strong>Note No WMD IS used in this battle!</strong><br><br>MY own PRE-EMPTIVE strike, that means enemy is not alerted,<br>strike factor and secret mobilisation.<br><br>Did not decided to go all out cause we might need to use resources if this war drags, but decided to unleash super heavy firepower to complement PRE_emptive.<br><br>Made a whole lot use of bombers like in pearl habor and C-130s with commandos , blasted enemy bases so they cannot fight back.<br>and approx 1 hour after blasting , we capture enemy aircraft by dropping in troops to block the enemy from using the airbase again , only focus on fighter airbase cause more worthy .<br><br>And lastly with the tanks left, i did the unthinkable, i rushed up with MBTs and IFVs through a hidden jungle and splited into 2 sections before reaching capital.<br><br>Fired a volley of cannons , packed with airstrikes to shock the enemy into surrender.<br><br>Patrolling enemy airspace , and make sure that their counter-air stuffs is weakened, while i lay a surprise ambush at their naval base , at their naval base , i secrely placed troops inside the ships and sailors were too scared when they saw my troops, held them and obtained other key information.<br><br>Used their ships to fight their own ships,<br><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><br>I HAVE NOT LOST in Any Red Alert 2 or Command and Conquer Generals Match Before!</span></div>
