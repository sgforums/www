However, not sure of the armour type used.

No medium to long range SAM like SA-10 or HAWK/Patriot.  SEAD using HARM, or ALARM when Typhoon comes in, would do the job.  Tricky ones will be the passive MANPADS, this will require simultaneous air and land penetration - Longbow and SF teams to do Operation Cleansweeps all over the FEBA</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>While it might be interesting to note what our neighbours are buying, we should all remember one thing, cliche as it may be. WAR IS HELL. When war breaks out, there is no victor &amp; only losers.<br><br>So while there is a need for every country to ensure they are adequately armed to defend themselves, it is also pointless to engage in a tit for tat arms race. Oh you bought this so I must buy that to counter. Since you are getting that, so I must get this.<br><br>So I don't see why some ppl get all flustered about M'sia buying this &amp; buying that. Yes they are buying MBTs, but we supposedly have MBTs too right? They are getting subs but so what, we have subs too. They are getting new fighter jets, as are we. They are getting self propelled howitzers &amp; we already have the Primus. They are considering to get attack helicopters, while we already have the Apache.<br><br>So I fail to see the big deal. Some might see M'sia's sudden purchases as a threat to S'pore. I prefer to adopt a more rational point of view.  During the past years when the economy sucked, S'pore not only did not scale down defence spending but increased the defence budget.<br><br>M'sia on the other hand greatly slashed defence spending. Many purchases were put on hold. So they are now merely making up for lost time. Stuff which they wanted to buy last time but couldn't due to huge cuts in defence spending, are being bought now when their economy is better.<br><br>It is M'sia's right to buy whatever they deem necessary to defend themselves, just as it is our right to do the same.<br><br>So let us not get all hot under the collar &amp; start speculating why M'sia is suddenly buying so many things &amp; also saying that SAF should buy this because M'sia bought that.<br><br>A tit for tat response serves no purpose &amp; as what our defence minister said before, you don't need a tank to fight a tank. It could be a rocket system mounted on a tracked vehicles or even an attack helicopter. In other words, what I'm saying is that we don't have to buy something just 'cos M'sia bought it. As long as we are able to counter potential threats &amp; keep our country safe, that is good enough.<br><br>We don't want our SEAsian neighbours to get all suspicious of us each time we buy something, so let's accord them the same respect when they buy something.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>well, that's precisely what i've been trying to put across - that the perceptions of threat arising from our identification of the boundaries of the "self" in relation to the "other" are constructed via the intersubjective social relations.<br><br>To put it simply, once we stop thinking of the Malaysians as our enemy, and they do likewise - a reconstitution of the culture characterising our relations would occur.
