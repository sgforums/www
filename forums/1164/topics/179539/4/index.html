The charging handle can ony be pulled halfway and the dust cover does not open when the handle is pulled.<br><br>This toy is actually heavier than the real thing. It is one of the most vaunted airsoft models now currently available.<br><br>I was hoping to buy a M-16A1 for sentimental reasons but this make - Classic Army - only had the more modern M-16A2, A3 or A4.<br><br>Currently, this "M-15A4" series from Classic Army - a Hong Kong company - is considered one of the best buy on the airsoft market. However, I am not satisfied with its power, so I may consider modification at a later stage,<br><br>As with all AEGs (Automatic Electric Gun), the least ssatisfactory part of the weapon - in terms of realism - is the butt. Because the butt is used to house the battery, it is often flimsy compared to the real thing.<br><br>So you can't give someone a buttstroke to the face and expect your weapon to remain in one piece.<br><br>It's not cheap, the weapon alone costs me USD 525, batteries, charger, sling and pellets not included.<br><br>Of course I pay a premium cos it's smuggled from Hong Kong.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>yeah, thats quite a premium you paid.<br><br>mine was like USD 320+shipping (HK prices), and that was 3 years ago, so by rights, the price should have dropped significantly in that time.<br><br>All airsoft guns, aside from those made 20-odd years ago (which were made of proper metal) - and so classed as 'Classic airsoft', are incredibly fragile.<br>The metal is not metal, but often an amalgam of different types of cheap (pot or pig) metal, and sometimes mixed plastic polymer and metal filings.<br><br>I've seen many airsoft guns, even 'metal' ones simply snap in half because someone lent on them or something.<br>They were never built to be used as rougly as real weapons in real life - and rightly so, because they were targeted for the toy and collector market first and foremost.<br><br>The main areas of contention for realism is actually the width of the receiver, and the width of the handgrip.<br>Its often alot wider than the real thing, and though they've managed to get round this by installing the correct width picatinny rail [if present], people who have handled the real deal can often tell the difference straight away.<br>The reason for the disparity in widths is because the handgrip houses the electric motor [same as in r/c cars] and the receiver houses the gearbox and subsequently the springs and piston too.<br>Obviously in the real deal the handgrip is hollow, but this is the best place for the motor angle position.<br><br>Do you intend to go playing with this new toy or is it purely for plinking and wall-mounting?<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I did pay quite a premium when I forked out USD 525 for this model.<br><br>On the internet, the going price for this model is around USD 400 to USD 420, so I paid a premium of about USD 100 more.<br><br>I don't really intend to play any more wargames as I think I am a little too old for this kind of things. Beside, it takes up too much time. I'm not even gonna shoot it much as the apartment is too small for that, and I it is illegal to take it outdoors unless you know where it is "allowed" - as in police close one eye.<br><br>But I have to say that taking this CA made AEG to skirmishes is not a good idea as it is WAY too heavy. It is heavier than the real thing. Something this dense, if you drop it, some parts will surely break.<br><br>I would sooner take a all-plastic Marui as they are cheaper, and WAY lighter.<br><br>I am facing one problem with the sights on this weapon while zeroing. I slowly moved the groupings from very far off target to quite close to target. But I have adjusted the rear sight all the way to the right and still couldn't get my grouping onto the bull. They are still hitting about 1cm left and above of the bullseye. The height is not a problem as I haven't yet adjusted the front sight post as the tool is missing. But I can't adjust the grouping to land more to the rightside anymore as the rear sight can't move anymore to the right.<br><br>Any suggestions - other aiming off?</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>not sure what i can suggest.<br>AEG's are pretty much the last type of airsoft product to use as a target shooter..<br>(bar, according to reports, TM's M14 series which is apparently the best shooting and most accurate AEG out of the box)<br><br>it sounds like perhaps the inner barrel is slightly off - perhaps worth stripping down the front section, and have a look at how its held in [grub screw and tension usually, but watch for the hop up rubber, which is generally considered to be not as good as Tokyo Marui's rubber], or the outer barrel might need tightening [mine loosnes occasionally].<br>i take it youre shooting at very short distances within your flat.<br>alot of people, if they want better accuracy out fo their AEG's are aware that the standard innder barrel for AEG's is considered a bit wide - so the bb kind of lops aroun din the barrel before it gets out, decreasing accuracy in general anyway.<br>alot of people then swap the standard inner barrel for whats called a tightbore barrel which keeps the bb on a more direct course.<br>tighter barrels also increase the velocity by a fraction as well.<br>longer barrels are also another way of increasing accuracy but at a much reduced fraction compared to other options.<br><br>best thing is to speak to someone who deals with the ins and outs of airsoft guns to see what [and how much!] your options are.<br>[i generally do not tinker inside my weaopns so i'm not the best to ask]<br><br>As for power, bear in mind that CA and alot of other manufacturers outside of Japan generally tool up for the foreign markets.<br>While TM always had to cater for a market where the playable guideline in the field was power equal or below 1J, and often the rating was a conservative 0.8J.<br>There is a 1J law in effect in the UK and in a few other coutnries [US is a bit freer but i state dependant] tha means that these guns, when they were originally at their factory-produced power ratings, would have been illegal to use on the fields.<br>CA, and a few others subsequently modified their production power ratings and lowered the power of their guns. to be able to be more appealing ot other markets outside of China and SEA in general.<br><br>as for weight vs realism, thats a common misconception that if it is made of metal, it will be the same weight as the real thing. the massive internal differences means that the airsoft gun is alot heavier than its real life equivalent.<br>TM's guns are plastic because the law in Japan says that replica guns cannot be produced in full metal.<br><br>TOP's M60 and M249 were generally half the weight of the real deal.<br><br>Star/Guarder's replica of the Troy Industries SOPMOD M14 is actually spot on, at 11pounds / 5kg's, which gnerally means it weighs a ton, and thats without accessories.<br><br>This is why Systema's PTW presnal training weapon is not made out of real metal - it cant be as it would exceed the real weapons weight without any benefits of the real weapons strength in its materials.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Actually, I have just discovered the problem with the zeroing on my AEG is a very obvious one. There is nothing wrong with the internal workings or the barrel, which shot very consistent and very tight groupings.<br><br>What is wrong are the sight posts themselves.<br><br>I found that the front sight post is not mounted 90 degree. It is slightly tilted to the right.<br><br>But this is nothing compared to the rear sight post. Because this AEG is the A4 variant of the M-16, the rear sight post is the removable type mounted on RIS rails.<br><br>The rear sight unit is not properly made, so upon tightening of the screw, the entire rear sight unit is sitting at a tilt - a rather bad tilt. That's why even when I rotated the rear aperture all the way to the right, I still couldn't get the zeroing I need.<br><br>Quite contrary to what you said about target shooting with AEG, for short distances up to 10m most AEGs can be very accurate. Under that distance the accuracy could be pinpoint.<br><br>The last AEG I owned in Hong Kong was a Marui MP5A4. I got the rear sights zeroed, though the front is fixed.<br><br>I can put out a candle flame with just one quickly aimed snapshot from a distance of 6m with that AEG consistently. I always scored the marksman grade in the army.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Even after tuning the front sight post upwards, the shots are still hitting  1cm high above the target but dead center. Of course, this would remedy itself out at longer distance with bullet drop.<br><br>Anyway, new addition: China-made Aimpoint red dot scope USD50.<br><br><img src="http://www.hunt101.com/img/385284.jpg"></div>

With this setup, I should remove the rear sight unit. I didn't do so as I didn't want to zero again. UNfortunately there's no provision for the foresight unit to fold down out of the way.<br><br>My Aimpoint replica unit was purchased in Shanghai and made in China. I pay a high premium for everything I buy from this shop as most of these stuff are sold illegally. I'm on the lookout for a cheaper shop. The red dot works but in the dark the sight picture is slightly darker than using naked eyes.<br><br>I remember you have several firearms and load tyour own ammo. But have you ever considered buying airsoft? They're real fun to play with. All my years of training with real firearms in the army couldn't beat one airsoft skirmish. The fear of being hit makes the game really heart-thumping. And actually, it puts all your training, theories and ideas about a firefight into practice.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>tvdog,<br><br>While not absolutely necessary, it's usually a good idea to have some kind of BUIS (back-up iron sight) on which to fall back, should your red-dot sight become inoperative. Take a look at <a href="http://www.ar15.com/forums/topic.html?b=3&amp;f=18&amp;t=206233" rel="nofollow">this</a> thread on AR15.com for a detailed explanation of the benefits of a BUIS.<br><br>Here are a couple of images of the Hakko TacPoint red dot sight mounted on one of my ARs (I'm just including the links as the images are rather large and I do not wish to clutter up this thread):<br><br><a href="http://i12.photobucket.com/albums/a221/screwthepap/TacPoint_02.jpg" rel="nofollow">From  the left</a><br><br><a href="http://i12.photobucket.com/albums/a221/screwthepap/TacPoint_01.jpg" rel="nofollow">From the right</a><br><br>The BUIS at the rear is an A.R.M.S. #40A2 flip-up sight that co-witnesses through the bottom third of the sight picture. <a href="http://i12.photobucket.com/albums/a221/screwthepap/TacPoint_04.jpg" rel="nofollow">Here</a> is what it looks like through the sight, with the "focus" on the centered red dot. Should the dot fail for whatever reason, shifting your line of sight down a fraction of an inch will bring the iron sights to bear.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Thanks for the pics. My USD 50 red dot sight looks like that, too. So how much does a real aimpoint red dot costs?</div>
