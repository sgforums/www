So i was wondering if i could get a bolt action rifle in broken down. I was considering between VSR-10 gspec from tokyo marui and the vrs-11 from HFC.

You just need a licence to be able to do so, and like real firearms licences, I dont think many people *personally* have that kind of licence!<br>Join a club and you'd be fine. Just dont take it home.<br><blockquote>Btw, does anyone know where to get the HFC gas for airsoft in singapore, i was thinking of getting a gas powered bolt action rifle as i'm into the sniping role now.</blockquote>Gas sniping is rather notorious, if only because of the odd peculiarities associated with the gas itself and the operation of the gas rifle.<br>More often than not, the gas rifle will lead to inconsistent shooting, whereas a spring-based rifle will be somewhat more consistently accurate.<br><br>Tanaka's M700, Police, and M700 Takedown (You can flip a tab, and unscrew the weapon so it is split in half and store it or carry it that way, the mountings  do not get disturbed so your zero should be held) and the more recent AICS M700 are examples of widely used, and well regarded gas rifles.<br>HFC22 typically gets you 500fps.<br>HFC134a considerably less.<br>Change your ammo when you use sniper rifles as it affects their flight path and ballistic characteristics.<br><br>Maruzen's L96 Police and Tokyo Marui's VSR series are typically well regarded spring rifles. Consistently reliable and accurate, many people prefer these over the gas rifles for these reasons.<br><br>KJW and HFC have been making copies of everyone elses rifles for some time.<br>KJW's copies of Tanaka's rifles have been quite successful at less than half the price but with identical construction.<br><br>Other rifles such as the M24 and APS etc, although they have good reputations, they all require a considerable investment in both money and parts and labour and maintenance in getting them up to a performance that equals the L96 and VSR series that perform well straight-from-the-box.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Actually u are all right, i get confuse between HCF and HFC.

Alright thanks for reading</div></blockquote>agree. airsofts can't kill. ever. I regularly shoot myself in the arm or legs at point blank with my airsofts. I also have shootouts with my friend when he visits my flat. It would be a joke to say it can kill. It might injure, if it hits the eyes, but it certainly could be used to commit a crime, as its not easy to tell if its a real weapon or not. Hence I guess that is a consideration for the sg govt to ban airsofts. Its their decision, and much as I don't like it, they do have valid reasons. Hence, I will only keep my airsofts in London, I won't ever bring them back to Sg. There is no reason to bring them back to Sg anyway.</div>
