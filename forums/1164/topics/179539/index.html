I would just love to have a replica of my "wife".</div></blockquote>I know what you mean by your "wife" - not exactly an M4, but a CAR-15 Israeli-style.<br><br>But like I said, the M4/CAR-15 collapsible butt cannot store a battery. And this means the battery has to be stored in the front part of the weapon either within the foregrip housing, or above it inside a mock laser unit. Both these options means making the weapon front heavy.<br><br>Though the M4/CAR-15 collapsible butt is most good-looking.<br><br>Originally, I placed an order for the "A" option of M-15 SPC (Special Purpose Carbine) - which was what I wanted originally. But just now I changed my order to the CQB option.<br><br>Because at the shop this morningI handled the "B" option which is the CQB version. The butt is collapsible but is referred to as the "crane" which means it is wider than the normal M4 butt. Thus it can store the battery.<br><br>The CQB weapon is shorter than the SPC. It is an all metal construction (as is the SPC), which means it is one nasty-looking piece of compact weaponry. I picked it up and it was wicked - so dense and reassuringly heavy. Officially its weight is listed as 3kg. One guy weighed it and reported that it was 3.9kg.<br><br>Being a traditionalist I originally wanted a M16A1 just like my wife in the army. But heck, who can say "no" to this baby.

When I tested the thing, the only part that wobbled was the collapsible stock. But when I get tired of this collapsible stock I plan to replace it with a standard M-16 stock.</div></blockquote>i was referring to the other manufacturers when i said 'cheap'.<br>UTG, CYMA, Wells, SRC, FMC, AIM, etc.<br>as for other manufacturers in the same league as Classic Army: G&amp;P, G&amp;G, Star, KJW, Guarder, HFC, ICS, etc, the prices are broadly comparable.<br>Star have a good name for innovation [the Troy M14 SOPMOD, L85, L85UGL, L86, L85 carbine, etc ]<br>UTG make exact copies of the Tokyo Marui's for half the price.<br><br>I know what each CA [specifically the M15A4 series] has - i've owned one for a couple of years.<br>Armalite got very pissed off with CA because the agreement was that CA only sell Armalite marked products through approved/licenced retailers. CA sold them to anyone and everyone.<br><br>Heres a few of mine. The CA is in the centre, with the SIR on it. The one above it is 15-20 years old.<br><br><img src="http://i49.photobucket.com/albums/f296/zoikzoik/airsoft/IMGP7434-05.jpg"><br><img src="http://i49.photobucket.com/albums/f296/zoikzoik/airsoft/IMGP7434-04.jpg"><br><br>Google videos had a video of an airsoft game in mainland China, in a deserted village.<br>i cant find the link atm..<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>tvdog, why dont you also pose this question on airsoftarnies?

I am humbled... Where do you live for in Singapore you can't possibly have such a collection. I have a few friends who each managed to smuggle one or 2 back to SG,<br><br>I used to own a Marui MP5A4 and a couple of Beretta 92F while living in Hong Kong. But when I left for Shanghai I had to give them away.<br><br>I do terrribly missed not having a MP5 - what brand do you recommend for an MP5 model. Apparently the CA MP5 series is crap.<br><br>Why do I not go onto a airsoft forum? I should - shouldn't I. Just at that time couldn't be bothhered to go thru the whole registration bit.<br><br>But I am quite sure that either of those 2 models I short-listed will be a good buy. And I have already decided on the CQB over the SPC. So unless the shop keeper runs away with the money I already paid - I should be a very happy owner of a heavy metal weapon in a few days' time.</div>

Of course, that was a long time ago and memory is not dependable for details.<br><br>Critics had said that the M-16 collapsible stock - though not as short as fully foldable stocks - is the best compromise between compactness and sturdiness. It is supposed to be more sturdy and comfortable than most collapsible/foldable stocks then available.<br><br>Therefore it is surprising to learn that there's also a wobbling problem with real weapons.<br><br>The CA airsoft "crane" collasible stock wobbles like a XXX. So I might eventually change it for a fixed stock. I just like the stubbiness of the barrel.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>of course i cannot build up a collection such as this in sg.<br>i am in uk now, where it is also under threat by government <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_sad.gif" alt="Sad" title="Sad"><br><br>Even if i could build up such a collection in sg, I doubt very much the MinDef would help out as much as the equivalent authorities in the UK do [see pics below].<br><br>best MP5 would be a hybrid.<br>CA bodywork with TM internals.<br>UTG make a very cheap MP5 that i think has TM copy internals, and comes complete with both retractable and solid stock accessories in one box.<br><br>NEWS:<br>If you are on the lookout for a new MP5, wait a bit.<br>Classic Army have a new generation of full metal MP5's which are being produced now.<br>They are currently being reviewed, so if they turn out to be as good as their last generation of guns - M249, M15A4CQB, G36, etc, then you might actually be able to buy probably the best airsoft version of the MP5 yet produced.<br><br>Classic Army's are now only known for a couple of issues, the one major one being the Hop-up. Replace that and you should be fine. The piston is the only other major factor but alot have reported no problems using CA's stock piston.<br>So watch for the new Classic Army MP5's.
