            <div class='col-md body'>I've been in a few airsoft "battles" in Hongkong. I must say it is the best fun you can have with your pants on.

            <div class='col-md body'>yeah, it is a lot of fun.<br><br>and the real deal guys like it too as it doesnt hurt as much as simmunitions [and you dont have to wear annoying paintball masks] and youre using realistic weapons to train/play with so you do everything that you'd do normally with your service weapons, its just that no one gets hurt and no one dies and its alot quieter..<br><br>on a sidenote, perhaps its worth moving this thread to the still open AIRSOFT sub forum instead of here in Military Nuts?<br></div>

You should try CQB with a few ppl in a big deserted and quiet building. is damn scary and damn fun.<br><br>however i think outfield is not tt bad as vests absorb alot of the impact of BBs.

            <div class='col-md body'>Normally you can hear them hitting you if youre wearing hard armour or alot of gear - anywhere unprotected, you can feel them. If you get a 'facial' you definately know about it!<br>Even if you suspects its a ricochet, the honourable thing is to call yourself out - best to be sportsmanlike.<br><br>Mixed environments with both woodland, and open fields, trenches, tunnels and urban areas gives the best of both worlds with both FIBUA and CQB procedures required.<br>Disembarking from tracked mech in the middle of the night in a massed assault is alot of fun though.<br></div>

No handguns though cos it can't be stripped down and smuggled in.<br><br>Btw, does anyone know where to get the HFC gas for airsoft in singapore, i was thinking of getting a gas powered bolt action rifle as i'm into the sniping role now.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>don u did not reply to my PM. Anyway got a link to that CO2 vulcan Heng?<br><br>And for LMGs, STAR M249s are more worth the money, you are just trading in a full metal CA M249 for a STAR mostly plastic M249 for half the cost, whichs gives higher FPS and is just as reliable! PLus being lighter means its not so heavy to lug aroudn during scrims. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_eek.gif" alt="Shocked" title="Shocked"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>The CA is still more robust and perhaps more reliable than the Star M249.<br><br>Star has plus points in poly/plastic construction=lightness and overall cost is cheap, and the magazines are much better than CA's.<br>CA has metal construction which makes them better than both Star and Top in the robustness stakes, and the internals are pretty reliable.<br><br>Minus is that it does cost twice as much as the Star, but its still cheaper than Top.<br>The cocking [charging] handle is movable [but non functional] in the CA and Top for that matter] but just immovable moulded plastic on the Star.<br>The Star's cannot use an M16 magazine when not using the box magazine.<br>(I cant remember if CA can or not - probably not, but the Top could)<br><br>The M249 is the Support weapon of choice on the Airsoft field.<br><br>The airsoft Vulcans are somewhat notorious.<br>While they have made appearances on the field, they eat up so much ammunition and require so much care and attention, that they are little more than liabilities to themselves.<br>They also tend to make the user an instant BB magnet <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>HENG@ you better buy quick before all the Laws come into effect and you cant buy the guns you want anymore in the UK.<br>(Move to Europe!)<br><br>cold_Zero: Rather than draw lines, they draw large nets around, as a 'catch all'.<blockquote>and guns or any other kind of gun from which any shot, bullet or other missile can be discharged</blockquote>This does include Airsoft as it does discharge <span style="font-style: italic;">something</span> - it didnt necessarily have to be a bullet, plastic ball or a metal one.<br>Airsoft also clearly goes into the 'Imitation' category as they are copies, many of which are licenced, of the real weapons, even if the material and the internals are clearly not.<br><br>Funny thing is, they allow the use and playing of Paintball RAM/RAP type weapons elsewhere in sg.<br>So why not Airsoft?<br>The RAP/RAM's are actually made by Classic Army under its Chinese name - quite clearly an Airsoft manufacturer of some note.<br>So this is where the line, for me, is very blur.<br><br>By this example, whats to stop someone creating a game site, where the weapons are held on-site until used, just like in an ordinary gun club, or indeed the Airsoft Asia IPSC club?<br>No one takes it home, its stored safely, but you guys can import what you want! And, whats more, you can actually use them legally then!<br>But no, Airsoft has some kind of stigma attached to it thanks to shortsightedness of some...<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I remember reading an article that SAF has begun trials with airsoft for training.<br><br>If I remember correctly, the AEG they used are Classic Army.<br><br>There is a Japanese brand called Systema that makes some kind of AEG not for sale to civilians. Apparently they are only for sale to law enforcement agencies for training purposes. Anyone can shed any light?</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Yeah, its the Systema PTW - Professional Training Weapon.<br><br>Systema initially supplied LE units in the US for training, and once that was complete they sold commercially.<br><br>The first few batches exhibited quite a few problems.<br>Subsequent production [which was rumoured to have been canned due to poor sales] yielded improved products and now they are quite well regarded.<br><br>Construction is made with Die-cast aluminium, which overall means weight is identical to the real steel.<br>All dimensions are identical to real steel.<br>(Airsoft AEG's traditionally had slightly incorrect measurements - partially because the gearbox and motors were wider than a real steel handgrip and receiver, amongst other reasons)<br>Any plastic used on this is fibre reinforced meaning its much stronger than any equivalent Airsoft plastic/poly material.<br><br>The differences to normal Airsoft is that its functionality and detail is closer to the real weapon.<br><br>Although this is still an AEG, it stops firing after last round leaves the barrel, and the PTW is the only AEG that always cycle the gearbox when you pull the trigger (means you cannot 'just tap' the triger to let off a round or prep a round liek in Airsoft. You hit the trigger, rifle will fire, meaning you must always observe proper firearm safety procedure).<br><br>The magazines used are real steel dimensions [Airsoft magazines are traditionally shorter]. Each Systema magazine has a follower that triggers a switch in the body to cut off power to the gearbox whenever the magazine is empty.<br>Because of the follower design, it doesn't matter if you load 5 rounds or 50 rounds into the magazine (which holds 120rds - but you can low-load the magazines), the gun will still stop firing after you clear the mag.<br><br>Instructors can choose to pre-load only 30 rounds of BBs into each magazine to simulate the actual weapon's capacity, and together with realistic rate of fire it even mimics how fast one might run out of rounds and needed to reload in a stressed environment.<br>Beyond that, once you've inserted a fresh magazine you will also have to hit the bolt-release button (which internally resets the circuitry) to ready the weapon - again just like the real-steel.<br><br>The sound is very different to an ordinary AEG - you cannot hear the gearbox 'turning over' to complete its cycle before firing a round, which you normally can in ordinary Airsoft AEG's.<br><br>Realism breaks with the PTW when you field strip the weapon or pull the charging handle.<br>The gearbox is a new improved split case design that allows the upper part to separate away with the upper receiver. This allows quick change of the spring unit, abit like how ICS and the newer Star AEG's offer quick change solutions.<br>The charging handle does its job, but only has a small amount of movement to do its job.<br>Hop-up can only be done by field stripping the weapon so you have access to a screw set in the upper receiver. This is one of the drawbacks of the PTW.<br>I believe the FPS is adjustable - you can order different types of piston/spring units, but they come as complete units and not easily modifiable yourself.<br><br>The other, main, drawback of the PTW is price. Because of what they are, and who theyre normally aimed at, their per unit cost is about US$1000.<br><br>PTW's are currently available as M16-A2, A3, and M4-A1 (with Crane stock for improved battery performance), and can be bought from any major Airsoft retailer.<br><br>Systema are currently developing SMG (MP5's) and handgun versions of their PTW system.<br><br>hope that helps!<br></div>
