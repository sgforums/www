            <div class='col-md body'>Multi-Billion-Dollar Malaysian Navy Deal Intact Despite Delays: Official<br>By AGENCE FRANCE-PRESSE, KUALA LUMPUR<br><br>A controversial multi-billion-dollar contract to build 27 high-tech vessels for the Malaysian navy is intact despite delays and calls for an inquiry, a company official said June 27.<br><br>PSC Naval Dockyard signed a 24.3 billion ringgit ($6.4 billion) contract in 1998 to build the heavily-armed offshore patrol vessels (OPV) over a 10-year period. It was due to deliver the first two last year.<br><br>But the handover of the boats, built with foreign partners led by GermanyÂ’s ThyssenKrupp AG, was postponed after numerous technical problems during sea trials.<br><br>The Asian Wall Street Journal reported in March that the government was looking for ways to unwind the contract because it was increasingly sceptical that PSC could deliver.<br><br>The opposition has urged a probe into the delays, saying the government had already invested 2.5 billion ringgit in the project and it could turn into Â“the biggest financial scandal in MalaysiaÂ’s historyÂ”.<br><br>=================<br><br>OK-I post something stupid from malaysia......to be fair....<br>Malaysians sometimes very fair ......</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><br><br>Haaretz Daily,<br>Wed., December 15, 2004 Tevet 3, 5765<br><br>Extracted from http://www.haaretz.com/hasen/spages/514546.html<br><br>Regrettably, Sunday's deaths of five IDF soldiers from the Desert Reconnaissance Battalion in Rafah does not symbolize the common destiny and integration of Bedouin in Israeli society, but rather the contrary. From the reactions of the families to their deaths, including the refusal of four of the families to have their sons buried in military funerals, one can understand that there are a lot of reservations about enlisting in the army in their communities.<br><br>Yusuf Jahaja, father of Sgt. Sa'id Jahaja, was the only one who agreed that his son be buried in a military ceremony - but he asked to cover the Israeli flag on the coffin with a blanket. He said that in the eyes of many his son was perceived as a collaborator and even a traitor, but that his son regarded army service as a way to get ahead in life, and Yusuf agreed.<br><br>Sa'id, who was killed in Rafah, was an Arab Muslim from the village of Arara. He served in the battalion known as the "Bedouin Battalion" even though he was not a Bedouin, which raises the question of whether there is not something problematic in the formation of battalions made up of people from one sector of society, particularly a sector that suffers from discrimination, and whether the assignments and missions given to such a unit are not derived from the social status of the soldiers who serve in it.<br><br>The Desert Reconnaissance Battalion, for example, which is mostly comprised of Bedouin, has spent the last four years in the line of fire in Rafah, while other soldiers serving on the front lines are in rotation, not permanently positioned there.<br><br>The Desert Reconnaissance Battalion accepts into its ranks Bedouin, Arabs and Muslims who are not obliged to enlist. Service in the unit is a way for young people to escape the economic crisis in which they live at home. Sometimes it is the only way they can get a steady job. The need to risk their lives just to earn a livelihood is also discomforting, especially considering just how much the Bedouin suffer from discrimination against them in budgets and infrastructure for their communities.<br><br>=======================<br><br>5 Muslim troops died for Israel in a battle in Dec 2004...........cooks, my foot.........the Jews can trust their Muslim guys to fight.....<br><br>.</div>
