            <div class='col-md body'>Rather than comment directly on a topic which I have no first-hand knowledge of....<br><br>I quote from a synopsis by The Washington Post's Book World of a work called "Armageddon - The Battle for Germany 1944-45" by Max Hastings...<br><br>Quotes from synopsis<br><br>"<span style="color: blue;"><strong>Hastings, a former editor of the Daily Telegraph, has a low opinion of the U.S. and British strategy and conduct of the war.</strong></span> He concedes that not much could have been done to prevent Stalin's takeover of Eastern Europe but laments the lack of energy displayed by American and British soldiers. <strong>Hastings argues that the Anglo-Americans -- with a few outstanding exceptions, including some elite units -- were poorly trained, lacking in motivation and led by generals who were mediocre or, at best, competent but unimaginative. Better leadership from such generals as Montgomery and Eisenhower </strong>and less cautious troops would have prevented the disasters of the Battle of Arnhem (where Montgomery launched an extraordinarily badly planned attempt to end the war by grabbing bridges on the Rhine) and the Battle of the Bulge (where Eisenhower failed to destroy the reeling Wehrmacht before it had time to regroup); it also might have spared many lives by ending the war in 1944.<br><br>Indeed, without the Soviets' immense sacrifices, the Americans and the British would have never defeated Nazi Germany. But the Red Army's far superior fighting power and generalship went hand-in-hand with extraordinary brutality toward its own troops, as well as against enemy soldiers and civilians. Hence Hastings's admiration for the Soviets' military accomplishments is tinged with his contempt for Stalin's policies and for his soldiers' innumerable crimes.<br><br><strong>Hastings has no doubt that the best army of World War II was the Wehrmacht, which displayed outstanding professionalism and determination even in the final weeks.</strong> Awareness of the atrocities committed by Hitler's soldiers has hardly diminished the admiration of many military historians, professional soldiers and military history buffs for this seemingly perfect tool of war. This fascination with the Wehrmacht has a long tradition, going back to the influential British military historian and theorist Basil Liddell Hart's flattering 1948 portrait of Hitler's generals, which conveniently left out their crucial role as instruments of conquest, enslavement and genocide. This view is rooted in a depoliticized understanding of German soldiers that dismisses their ideological motivations and seeks to attribute their performance to skills or organization that could also be acquired by the armies of the democracies.<br><br>Hastings does acknowledge the fanatic resistance of hopeless foreign SS men and deeply indoctrinated Hitler Youth teenagers. He concludes that the democracies' less effective armies (and heavy reliance on industrial might) was the flip side of their soldiers' greater humanity, despite the unavoidable excesses by some men and the unnecessary destruction of German cities toward the end of the war. But such humanism was, of course, facilitated by what Hastings sees as a pact with the devil; the Anglo-Americans could fight a relatively moral war only thanks to the Soviet Union's terrible sacrifice and subsequent vengeance. This is, at best, qualified morality."<br><br></div>

It's all a matter of what you define by "better"... this topic is too loosely defined in the first place...<br><br>If:<br><br>Fighting tactical skills &amp; competency - German<br>Fighting strategy &amp; generals - German<br>Technology &amp; Equipment Quality (Armor) - German<br><br>But if:<br><br>Morality - Not German!<br>Logistics - Not German!<br><br>But overall which Army is better... that is... IF both resourced to similar levels (exclude for air, naval support)... which will win over the other... then the answer is obvious!</div>

With the PzII using a 25mm twin cannon and 1 machine gun.<br>When invading France, contray to popular believe, the French had MORE tanks and BETTER tanks. The Char B1 and Renualts being better then the PzI and PzII as well as the newer PzIII which had a 35mm gun if i recall correctly.<br>Heck up till late 1942 or early 1943 the German main battle tank the PzIV had a 75mm gun that was bloody terrible. Being very very short.<br><br>Ok well the K98 and the M1 were vastly different rifles. And well the base composition of each respective units were different. Each weapon had it's pro and con so i dont think u can compare them like that.</div>
