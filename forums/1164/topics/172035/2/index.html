And were used without much regard to their lives.<br>The SS were generally better because they were an elite formation who got the better men,pick of equipment and commanders.<br>However most of the commanders in the SS especially it's upper staff officers were pretty much choosen for their political loyalty rather then anything else. (Himmler comes to mind).<br><br>And over all while the fought differently, the Wehrmacht was way better in terms of ability.

However, there is often situation where they could prevail with tactical withdrawal to reduce lost but they choose not to and hold ground.... Most of the upper echelon leaders in SS are probably chosen based on loyalty but this is probably not the case for the officer in its combat arm... like Paul Hausser, Sepp Dietrich and Felix Steiner...Interestingly, SS leaders seem to excel very much in tactical operation than strategy than their regular army counterpart... probably with the exception of Dessert Fox</div>

Was trying to do it all from memory and well guess i remembered some wrongly <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>Oh another thing though, the German tanks had a huge advantage over the early French and British tanks  in the design and operation. The German tanks had a crew of 4. A driver, Gunner,Loader and Commander. The French had 3 man tanks. Driver,Loader and Commander/Gunner.(Not sure if the comannder or loader doubled as the Commander. But from what i can recall, it's this way)<br><br>So while the German tank gunner could shoot while his commander picked a new target and manned the radio, the french had to shoot, pick target,shoot.<br><br>Meaning the Germans could effectively keep a shooting as long as there were targets, the French had to Shoot and then pick a new target then shoot again. Add that do the fact that the commander had to man the radio too, meant that the French tanks were usually very overwhelmed.<br><br><blockquote>Agree that their higher casualty could be due to the difficult mission they draw.

However I believe alot of them were drawn from the wehrmacht themselves. Well apart frm Sepp Dietrich who was leader of the LAH since forever haha.<br>There have been times soldiers were choosen because they were loyal. Like Himmler who was put incharge of the SS army even though he was more a politician then a general. Heck Paulus was put in-charge of 6th Army was more with his political loyalties then his skills. Most of the more brash panzer commanders infact lost their commissions because they were not so politically relieable. Hence retreated when it was better unlike the SS units who held on because Hitler said so heh.<br>Btw i dont think Rommel was part of the waffen SS. Or even commanded them. He never had any while in Afarica.And they werent under his direct command in Normandy.</div>

Most of the upper echelon leaders in SS are probably chosen based on loyalty but this is probably not the case for the officer in its combat arm... like Paul Hausser, Sepp Dietrich and Felix Steiner...Interestingly, SS leaders seem to excel very much in tactical operation than strategy than their regular army counterpart... probably with the exception of Dessert Fox</span><br><br>hi,<br><br>Meant to say that probably Rommel is the more notable leader whose style is similar to the SS officers....

Coupled with the poorer organisation, doctrine, morale and training... any further resistance would probably increase the casualty on the German side but perhaps would not really change the course of the war</div>
