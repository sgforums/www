            <div class='col-md body'>the japanese navy has a relatively long and rich maritime history. It proved to be a force to be reckoned with from the time it smashed the russian fleet in 1905 to pearl harbor and the sinking of hms prince of wales and repulse off kuantan during ww2.<br><br>After the war, it kept a pretty low profile although it's very strong and well-quipped fleet boasted of impressive home-built destroyers and submarines. So i'm not at all surprised by this new capability at all. IMO, it is asiapac's 2nd most powerful navy after the USN</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>The problem with carriers is that they are going increasingly senile as weapons systems. Political statements aside, it can be noted that carriers are by themselves, extremely vulnerable systems that now require an inordinate devotion of resources to their protection, just so they can do their job of launching aircraft to carry ordinance to their targets.<br><br>In our waters, carriers will be all the more vulnerable to conventional, and unconventional attack. We will have to devote tons of resources just to protect the carrier, and make sure that we have an infaliable shield against attack... all this just to launch aircraft (when it be done so from land)? An attack on a carrier that fails means that the carrier gets to live another day, but a defence that fails means the carrier is destroyed. The pros and cons are just not worth it for us. That is to project airpower from a ship, the costs required to maintain and protect this ship far exceeds that of land bases.<br><br>America has the cash and power, and even their carrier battle air group remains a largely ineffective weapon in pratical. In most modern wars they had fought, they barely dropped 1/3 the munitions that were dropped by all air strikes, and all this was done at far higher cost and risk (carrier aircraft suffer higher attrition rates). The carrier is more of an American political weapon then actual weapon of war that they can afford with their seeminGly limitless defence budgets... but do we?<br><br>The conventional carrier as we know it today will not be very useful in the smart-munitioned wars of the future. Maybe a hybrid arsenal-UCAV carrier type stealth ship might be envisioned that's far lower in maintaince and more capable of standing on it's own. But that's speculation on my part.<br><br>On the other hand, we should be seriously looking into the technology of hypersonic smart munitions that rely on sensor networks to find, and strike their targets anywhere on our map.<br><br>A hypersonic missile fired from anywhere in our turf can find it's way towards any potential target within it's operational range in a matter of minutes, if not even less, and destroy the target. A carrier can at best move a few hundred yards in the same amount of time to get it's planes into range, during which it is extremely vulnerable and has to be protected at all costs, and then there's also the factor of losing aircraft that cost you so much to put on a ship you have to protect with a good portion of your defence budget that can be spend getting these very smart munitions... When you do the math, it's far, far cheaper to plink point targets with future cruise missiles.<br><br>In the end, if we want to plink targets with our navy, it's far cheaper, and more effective to mount these munitions on our new and future stealth craft, and drive them around the south china sea anniliating Orang Utans in the jungle during our precision test firings.<br><br>My guess? The politics of the future will be cruise missile politics rather then carrier power projection...</div>

Anyway I was speaking on the carriers in revelance to our context, why cruise missiles are far more useful to us then commiting tons of money into getting a pseudo CAG when our LSTs are already near to fufilling that capability.<br><br>In the future, however, the carrier's days are greatly limited. Once cruise missile technology develops to the point when you can hit... say... Lebanon from White Sands in just 20 minutes, the carrier grows greatly redundant for hitting targets.<br><br>Why do you need grandose airbases or carriers in the future when you don't really need manned aircraft with limited range to plink targets at great cost and risk when a far cheaper, and more effective solution can be arranged?<br><br>As for ASW, why do you need a carrier to carry it out for when the most effective system in itself is another SSN or a dedicated craft like a Future Surface Combatant. If anything, it's all to easy to note that the carrier's ASW's capabilities are not really offensive, but they are rather defensive. If anything, the USN devotes an inordinate amount of resources just to make sure it's vulnerable carriers don't fall prey to subs.<br><br>Consider all this cost just to project 97,000 tons of steeL, or preform it's primary mission, getting planes and bombs to the target:<br><br>Fleet escort.<br>Defensive aircraft/Interceptors/ASW<br>Alegis Missile Shield<br>Subsurface defensive elements<br>Supportive elements<br><br>The cost of all this, is quite staggering, that's why only the US could afford keeping this up. But in the end, technology will evolve way faster then you can spend to defend a 30 knot ship. How would a carrier fare against a saturation attack of future hypersonic smart anti-shipping munitions?<br><br>Can the carrier and all it's defensive elements take on a saturation smart munition attack? In order for the defence to work it has and must work 100 percent of the time, for even a single hit on a carrier would most likely put it out of it's job for a few months, and in the worst cases, sink it. And that's a pretty heavy investment into defending an asset who's main job is to act as an airbase at sea. More akin to devoting a large amount of your defense budget into making defensive measures for an SM-1 tank just so it can shoot it's 75mm gun.<br><br>I'm not saying the carrier is obsolent for now, but it is going senile, which means that the carrier now has to devote more and more resources towards making sure it survives just to do its job. And that dosen't change no matter how the carrier fares now... it's just simple progression of technology. Like the rifle arm replaced the longbow which itself replaced the thrown rock. At the end of the day, it's the math of war that matters. Such technology is already in the works, and it's only a matter of time.<br><br>Why did the battleship get phased out as the king of the sea? Not because it could not do it's job of shelling targets and generally shooting, but simply because a carrier with it's longer reach and ability to deploy munitions with far more range and flexibility was simply far cheaper and more effective to operate. It works the same way in the future world of hypersonic smart munitions.<br><br>In the end, while 97,000 tons of steel makes good diplomacy, if it can be taken out with near future technologies, it dramatically alters the status quo.<br><br>With the status quo changed, why do cruise missiles need to carry out airspace control or ASW operations? Though this a possible consideration for their future application. All these supposed staples of warfare like air superiority and the like are for one justification, to make sure munitions reach their target. If you can do this without them, why bother with them?<br><br>In the end, why does the US still use carriers? Because there is no nation yet on earth which can challange them. But will this always be so? When such technology gets about and it will. As Smith would say... "It is inevitable"<br><br>A good read:<a href="http://www.airpower.maxwell.af.mil/airchronicles/bookrev/friedman.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.airpower.maxwell.af.mil/airchronicles/bookrev/friedman.htm</a></div>
