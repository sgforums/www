              <blockquote>During a study visit I made to Malaysia last year, a senior Malaysian
              Armed Forces (MAF) officer shared with me an episode in
              Singapore-Malaysia relations that he said occurred during a period of
              tension.<br> <br> According to the officer, the MAF was put on alert in late 1998 as
              politicians on both sides of the Causeway argued over the status of the
              Customs, Immigration and Quarantine (CIQ) checkpoint at Malaysia's
              railway station in Tanjong Pagar.<br> <br> News articles from the period chronicle the public exchanges, but say
              nothing of the defence postures that the SAF and MAF adopted during
              this period.<br> <br> Kuala Lumpur's unwillingness to acknowledge its heightened military
              preparedness - which military officials on both sides privately
              acknowledge did occur - was an astute move....</blockquote><blockquote>Operationally Ready National Servicemen who served in 1991 would recall
              the joint Malaysian-Indonesian military exercise, codenamed Malindo
              Darsasa 3AB, that occurred that year. It involved an airborne assault
              by paratroopers in southern Johor.<br> <br> If the name of the airborne assault, codenamed Pukul Habis (Malay for
              '<span style="color: #ff0000;">Total Wipeout'</span>), as well as the choice of a drop zone just 18km from
              Singapore, were not sufficiently provocative, the scheduling of the
              airdrop on Aug 9th - Singapore's 26th National Day - most certainly was.<br> <br> The SAF's response was measured and confident. It triggered an Open
              Mobilisation on the eve of National Day, a fact that was reported
              extensively in the local media.<br> <br> The move was calculated not to escalate tensions. But it signalled also
              Singapore's determination not to welcome a Trojan horse on its doorstep.</blockquote>

              <p>Both nations were run by matured men even in the old days, and today the men are very much alive and active politically on both sides. Looking at the political storm on the other side, lets hope that Pak La can hold on to his position for the country to deal with us as a truely matured man.</p>
              <p>As for conspiracy theory, did Answar really like man's backside? did Najib really had relationship with the mongolian? lets wait and see.</p>

              <p>Thats why I do not believe in symmetric response.  It doesn't mean that when they do something, we must mirror.</p>
              <p>They can have their exercises in Johore, we just need to get some people ready, but no need to start deploying.  What if they send troops to the borders? By mirroring, we only create potential incidents that can spark off unfavorable response.</p>
              <p>A chess player knows that as Black, he cannot symmetrically mimic all of White's action to defend. At a certain point, it will be very unfavorable for Black when it comes to exchanging pieces.  The same can be said for SAF's response.</p>
              <p>Assymmetric response, and leave our posture as an area of uncertainty.  Sometimes, the unknown can be too great an obstacle for potential aggressors to overcome.</p>

              <p>I agree with Shotgun...... strategising the response is important. Creating some uncertainty is good.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I had a conversation with a very senior chap once. He said that one of the scenarios we anticipate is the situation where the other side escalates the tension gradually and over a long period of time. But the other side holds back from overt aggression or border incidents, so we have no cause to strike first.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>On the other hand, Singapore is forced to go to higher Defcons with each escalation. Our forces are mostly NS men and if we keep mobilising and putting most on standby, our economy would suffer.</p>

              <p>Was 1991 the first time this happened? Maybe not.</p>
              <p>My memory
              getting fuzzy in my old age but I seem to remember there was at least
              one other earlier SG National Day in mid 1980s where the bastards
              pulled a similar stunt in Johore. This was never publicised ever, and I
              only knew about it cos I was serving in S2 Branch of a certain Brigade
              HQ. There was silent mob for some units and a one (or two) SIRs under
              our brigade were put on alert with arms (and perhaps ammo) issued</p>
              <p>All very wayang one.</p>
              <p>Anyway,
              doing the paradrop right at our backdoor can be read several ways.
              Apart from the obvious display of aggression and Malay unity, Malindo
              can be interpreted as an exercise that is actually <span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>DEFENSIVE</strong></span> in nature.</p>
              <p>Why?</p>
              <p>Because all it truly demonstrated is that MAF and TNI can send airborne rapid reaction forces to.... drum roll.... <span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Johore</strong>....</span></p>
              <p>...
              but NOT to Singapore, as any such attempt would result in very heavy
              losses ... Wipeout :) ... courtesy of RSAF and ground air defence.</p>
              <p>This
              Malindo Ex can be interpreted that in the event of SAF trying out
              "Forward Defence", MAF &amp; TNI can immediately regain initiative by
              putting (or reinforcing) a rapid reaction block force into Johore that
              can dash, disrupt or at least delay any hopes of a rapid SAF deployment
              into Johore to create a protective buffer for SG island.</p>
              <p>Or it
              can also show that after we've moved troops into Johore, they can still
              insert troops and cut us off at the rear, trapping SAF forces already
              on MY soil</p>
              <p>...</p>
              <p>In an invasive scenario it would be very
              silly to drop paratroops into Johore - with all the associated
              difficulties, danger and limitations - and then move them like ground
              troops towards SG.</p>
              <p>Therefore, though it is right for SAF to adopt
              an aggressive stance towards such weak displays, I really didn't see it
              as a direct threat. To me it was a naked display of their insecurity. :
