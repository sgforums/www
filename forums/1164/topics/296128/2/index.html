            <div class='col-md body'>I agree with SpecialOps' stance. Even the US didn't reveal they had F-117 Stealth fighters and B-2 Stealth bombers for ~ a decade in the 80's. Same for their Delta Force SOP. Sometimes the rumour that you have something can give you a big advantage - for example your enemy may hold back extra forces (critically needed elsewhere) to defend against your rumoured equipment.<br>In the cases SAF does reveal sensitive/tactical equipment, the full specs or additional gizmos or how they are deployed are not mentioned - because it gives the enemy a tactical advantage if they know the full capabilities.</div>
