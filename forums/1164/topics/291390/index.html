Australian Aerospace is working hard to achieve this milestone, which the Department of Defence says requires the delivery of 12 aircraft, enough qualified crews to form one squadron and the availability of appropriate support services.<br><br><img src="http://www.flightglobal.com/assets/getAsset.aspx?ItemID=20343"><br><br>Seven Tigers have so far been delivered to the Australian army<br><br>Australia has so far received seven aircraft and four of its six ground training devices, with the fleet having logged over 2,000 flight hours, mainly in support of training. Twelve aircrew, including six instructors, have completed training, with another six instructors and two test crews to complete qualification by year-end.<br><br>Australian Aerospace expects to complete Tiger deliveries by mid-2009.<br><br><a href="http://www.flightglobal.com/articles/2007/11/13/219253/australian-aerospace-battles-to-deliver-on-tiger-promises.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.flightglobal.com/articles/2007/11/13/219253/australian-aerospace-battles-to-deliver-on-tiger-promises.html</a></div>

So, Rooviak is out of the race for MAF.<br><br>According to Jane's, the Tiger is now favoured by the M'sian military and is earmarked for purchase pending release of funds by KL that is needed for current other military priority.</div>
