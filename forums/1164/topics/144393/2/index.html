I'm not doubting that there might be some pistols that can be cocked in the manner described, but I have personally never come across a DA/SA semi-auto or revolver in which you can cock the hammer or striker (that is, put the pistol into SA mode) by simply pulling and then releasing the trigger.<br><br>In other words, if you initiated a DA pull from the hammer down/striker unloaded position, pulled the trigger back to the point just prior to hammer/striker release, and then eased off on the trigger, the hammer/striker would return to its fully forward position. The one exception to this would be if the pistol was equipped with a "hammer drop safety notch" which would cause the hammer to stop just before contacting the firing pin (a safety feature to prevent a pistol from discharging if the cocked hammer were to accidentally slip off the sear).<br><br>However, if you did in fact use such a pistol in the manner you described during your NPCC stint, then <span style="font-style: italic;">you were effectively shooting the pistol in SA mode</span>. Think about it: the first part of the trigger pulled fully cocked the hammer and allowed you to ease up on the trigger without uncocking the hammer, and when you subsequently pulled the trigger, you were releasing an already-cocked hammer.<br><br>MG</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote>May I ask why you carry a gun, every day?</blockquote>For the same reason that thousands of law-abiding Americans here with valid handgun permits carry them: personal protection and safety. And yes, I have had occasion to draw (but thankfully not discharge) my handgun in public to protect myself in the past; that incident is recounted in  <a href="http://www.sgforums.com/?action=thread_display&amp;thread_id=143180&amp;page=1" rel="nofollow">this</a> thread (fifth post down).<br><br>The CZ100 is small and light enough to be easily concealed and unobtrusive in everyday carry.

I would say the effective range would be those distances at which you can <span style="font-style: italic;">consistently</span> hit your intended target with reasonable accuracy. Scope-equipped large-caliber (44 Mag and up) revolvers have been used by hunters here to take down some pretty sizable game animals like deer and elk from distances exceeding 100 yards.<br><br>My two Rugers pictured above have been used primarily to punch nice, round holes in paper at around 25 yards. At this distance, with open sights and shooting my target handloads from offhand, I'm usually able to keep the groups consistently under 3". Our club has an 18" cast iron gong mounted at the 200 yard backstop of the rifle range. With my <span style="font-style: italic;">benchrested</span> Super Blackhawk, I am occasionally able to hit the gong, but one has to aim high to compensate for bullet drop at that distance.<br><br>As for the cartridge lengths, SAAMI specs for the 357 Mag. and 44 Mag. are 1.590" and 1.610" respectively. In other words, pistols in those calibers have to be able to chamber cartridges <span style="font-style: italic;">up to</span> those dimensions. There will always be variations in overall cartridge length due to differences in projectile weight and length.<br><br>For a visual perspective, here's an image of all the cartridges I currently handload:<br><br><img src="http://webpages.charter.net/dlwh/Cartridges.jpg"><br><br>The 44 Mag. and 357 Mag. cartridges are fifth and sixth from the left, respectively.<br><br>MG</div>

The holster in the image above is an "outside waist band" (OWB) unit by GunMate that I use for winter carry, when there's always an outer garment (usually a sweater) to slip over and conceal the pistol. This holster is worn at the 3 o'clock position on the belt, and the only discomfort arises when I am driving and the seat belt digs into the holster somewhat.<br><br>For the rest of the year, I'll either tuck the pistol into the reinforced left inside pocket of my jacket, or carry it in a fanny pack.<br><br>MG</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><strong>Yep, the world is full of crims not like good old Singapore.</strong></blockquote>You could conceivably argue that the criminals in Singapore are the ones holding public office and drawing multi-million-dollar salaries.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz"><br><br><blockquote><strong>At a close range, say 3m, would the small .357 do as much damage as the big .357?</strong></blockquote>That would depend on the weight and type of the projectile.<br><br>Both calibers use projectiles of approximately the same diameter (0.355" and 0.357" for the 357 Sig and 357 Magnum, respectively), and projectile weights can vary widely. Commercial 357 Sig ammo can be found with projectiles ranging from 125 gr. to 147 gr.; 357 Magnum ammo is available from 110 gr. all the way up to 180 gr. Also, a hollowpoint projectile is apt to do more damage than an FMJ one, if it properly expands in the target medium.<br><br>Commercial 125 gr. 357 Sig ammo is typically loaded to a muzzle velocity of around 1400 fps, with 158 gr. 357 Magnum ammo at approximately 1500 fps.<br><br>(By the way, gr. = grain, and 7000 gr. = 1 pound.)<br><br>I am sure testing using ballistic gelatin has been performed to ascertain the effectiveness (as measured by penetration, expansion and projectile mass retention) of both calibers, but I currently do not have that information. However, at 3 meters, a well-placed shot from either caliber is likely to disable a normal human (i.e., one who isn't high on pain-suppressing drugs).<br><br><blockquote><strong>Next I would love to own a shotgun - I know no one argues with a shotgun.</strong></blockquote>Except that it's rather difficult to conceal a shotgun in public.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br><br><blockquote><strong>How do you qualify for a license to carry a concealed weapon? Are you in law enforcement? Or are you a CZ Armourer as your signature indicates?</strong> </blockquote>The procedure for applying for a handgun carry permit varies from state to state, but the requirements are usually quite standardized: you have to attend a state-sanctioned firearms training/safety course and submit an application to the city or county office or LE agency. A criminal background check will be performed, and if it comes back clean, you are a candidate for a handgun permit.<br><br>I say <span style="font-style: italic;">candidate</span> because there is a wrinkle in the process. In some states, handgun permits are given on a "may issue" basis, meaning that you have to show a need for carrying a handgun in public, even if you meet all the other requirements. In these states, the issuing authority (usually the county sheriff) is the sole authority in determing whether the need is valid or not. <span style="font-style: italic;">Most law enforcement agencies in this country are vehemently anti-2A and do not want firearms in the hands of private individuals.</span> Consequently, most handgun carry permit applications in these "may issue" states are denied for the flimsiest of reasons.<br><br>Other states, including Minnesota, have "shall issue" handgun permit laws, meaning that you <span style="font-style: italic;">cannot be denied</span> a permit if you meet all the prerequisites.<br><br>And yes, I am one of the several CZ-certified armorers servicing the Upper Midwest region. I am not in law enforcement, but I do occasionally work on CZ pistols carried by LEOs.<br><br>MG</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I just resize it !hope this helps.... Looks like everyone has a little misconception of the 357,  the usual 357 Magnum is usually chambered for the revolver or the Desert Eagle.  But the 357 SIG basically is a neck down cartridge from a .40 cartridge , neck down to a 9mm bullet. ! thus , it achieve almost a 357 Maganum power.<br><br>Thus, a 357 SIG pistol can be any of the .40 caliber auto pistol .. you can see that on a SIG229, GLocks, Springfield armoury XD , HK USP etc... since it has the same breech face as a .40 caliber!<br><br>FOr concel carry, usually in winter it is easier, U can wear a side holster and your jacket or vesy should easily concel the pistol, IWB ( in waist band holster can be use to) for Summer usuaully you need small and thin pistol like a PPK, Kahr or a small J frame revolver  that I usually drop into my right pocket.. works like a charm.<br><br>DaveC!</div>

You've obviously been watching far too many Hollywood action flicks.<br><br>Some states have "open carry" handgun permit laws, while others require that the handgun be concealed. Even if the carry law makes no specific provision that the handgun be concealed, it is still a good idea <span style="font-style: italic;">not</span> to carry openly in public as people around you may react negatively to seeing a firearm.

Consider this scenario: if an armed criminal walks into a convenience store with the intent of robbing it, and he sees a customer openly carrying a firearm, who do you think the criminal will shoot first?<br><br>It's best to be discreet and carry concealed, even if the state allows open carry.<br><br>As for waving a pistol around and firing randomly into the air, well, you can certainly do that... until the first round from an LEO's gun takes you down.<br><br><a href="http://www.dps.state.mn.us/bca/CJIS/Documents/CarryPermit/FAQs.html" rel="nofollow">Here</a> is a link to the FAQ section of Minnesota's handgun carry law. It is representative of similar laws in other states, and might help dispel any misconceptions you have about carrying handguns here.<br><br>In most states, any law-abiding citizen or PR can legally purchase and own firearms approved for sale in this country, without need of any kind of permit. But if you want to carry a hangun (concealed or openly) in public, you need the relevant permit (the exception being states like Vermont which allow you to carry openly <span style="font-style: italic;">without</span> the need for any kind of permit).<br><br>MG</div>
