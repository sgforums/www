The time to reload is the same. Revolvers suffer from small ammo capacity which was why the FBI changed to pistols, after an incident in the 1970s, in which 3 of their officers were killed or injured during a shootout with 2 guys who were armed with pistols and shotguns !<br><br>Pistols being issued to SAF troops is actually not that uncommon. However, you don't see this in the "normal" infantry units.  Either in specialised units (e.g. MPs)  or in support units , where carrying a carbine is deemed to be "bulky" in certain situations.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>In the general context (not considering the Singapore Police Force) here are what I know of Revolvers vs Mag-loaded pistol facts.<br><br>REVOLVER ADVANTAGES<br><br>* Revolvers are capable of taking very big calibres without the weapon being uncomfortable to hold. Example, a .44 Magnum bullet can be designed to fit into the cylinder of a revolver, making for a handgun capable of killing a big animal. But a .44 bullet is too long to fit into a typical handgrip mag-housing pistol. The .50 Desert Eagle pistol for example, not only has a nasty recoil, it is also too big for most people's hands to grip.<br><br>* Revolvers used for assasination leaves no empty shell casings.<br><br>* Someone already said a revolver jams less. This is even more important when you have special loads like softpoints bullets, etc. Also, those people who like to load their own specially powerful cartridges would probably prefer a revolver as  on a semi-auto pistol it may ruin the mechanism.<br><br>* Safety is better for when dropped, there is virtually no chance of the weapon going off unless it was already cocked.<br><br>* Another safety is that if the weapon is snatched there will be a maximum of 6 rounds in the weapon. Some officers I spoke to said they carry 5 rounds, leaving one empty chamber. Can't remember the reason why...<br><br>REVOLVER DISADVANTAGES<br><br>* A handgun is already hard to shoot properly. A revolver takes an even longer time to master especially for rapid firing without manually cocking every round.<br><br>* Small mag capacity as mentioned.<br><br>* Pistol magazine loading is faster, period.<br><br>* For assasination a revolver is hard to silence as the sound escapes from between the cylinder and the barrel.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote>The .50 Desert Eagle pistol for example, not only has a nasty recoil, it is also too big for most people's hands to grip.</blockquote>Indeed, the grip is rather large and uncomfortable to hold, but recoil is <strong>surprisingly</strong> tolerable due to the sheer weight of the pistol and the gas-operated recoil mechanism.<br><br>A friend of mine has a DE Mk.XIX chambered in 50AE, and shooting his 300 gr. JHPs through it is actually fun, once you get used to the massive concussion and muzzle flash. At the local indoor pistol range, other patrons usually back away from the firing line when they see you're about to let loose with the DE!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br><br><blockquote>* Safety is better for when dropped, there is virtually no chance of the weapon going off unless it was already cocked.</blockquote>Only if the revolver is equipped with an FP safety. See my previous post. Also note that if a cocked hammer is accidentally released when a revolver is dropped, the FP safety will prevent the hammer from striking the FP.<br><br>MG</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>there is reason why revolver is still around.<br><br>They are design for a better grip then pistol.<br><br>For Asia that make more different !!! yes in movies and books, all yep 13 -18 round mag !!! fantastic pistols !!! But take it to the range and shoot. Then you will know what I mean. They may be the best pistol in the whole world and with large mags ... but in the end don't they kind of a little too big for our hands ?<br><br>Usually for Asia build if is better we go for a revolver or a pistol ( woman gun in US ) which 7-9 rounds.  As they fix more firm and better suited for grips for Asia hands.  Yes may sound weird, but remember the one with the lighter and smaller gun draw faster , with better grip and shoot better and faster ! In real life, if you have to shoot it out with pistol or revolver 1-4 rounds is the max and you be diving for cover or usually match is over, not like movies which you get to shoot all 13- 18 rounds.<br><br>Maybe having more rounds sound more advantage. But a truely train shooter who not just train to shoot, but also be able to reload in the dark in the shortest time. In a trained hand, reloading can be so fast that even the opposite have bigger mag, it may not make a different.<br><br>Remember for pistol and revolver the real purpose of them . It is not the amount of rounds, for if you really need that much, you should be using a MP-5 instead.</div>

However , these is not the only reason, there is the zeroing part also, if you revolver or pistol is not zeroed, you can be the best double-action and still miss.<br><br>Yes last time with the old revolver there is a problem with shooting. That can be justified by the performance of real live action, reports of policeman engaging with revolvers but missed.  But since the change to the new revolver, with the new laser point inbuild , the shooting has improved to a very good level. If you notice the case that involve shooting, the policeman do hit the targets ever time.</div>
