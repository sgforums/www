            <div class='col-md body'>Well, I've never liked wheeled armoured vehicles, to be frank. They suffer from higher ground pressure compared to tracked vehicles. This makes them more likely to sink in soft soil and set off pressure-detonated mines.<br><br>Using four wheels instead of six will only lead to even higher ground pressure for the same carrying load. I never liked the Stryker, I'm a tad suspicious of our own Terrex, and I sure as heck don't like this vehicle, either.</div>

The armour of this vehicle doesn't look very thick. And upon closer inspection of the pics I think those aren't firing ports at all - they're more like glass windows.<br><br>My thinking is that these vehicles are made for recon purposes. Lots of glass windows for visual recon, and you can see the amount of hardware inside - possibly for heat-sensing, radar-scanning and nightvision equipment.<br><br>Besides, as you pointed out, it can't seat a lot of people. So I guess it's enough for a recon team but not for a full section of men.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>that looks like the forward compartment.Maybe for the commander and some specs. So assuming 4 in the forward compartment *driver included* and assuming there is space for 6 more u can seat almost a whole section in there. Doesnt look to bad a vehicle. Should be a troop transport vehicle the likes of the hummer or the jeep or land rovers.<br><br>Nice pics Mv, at least now we know they can fit a 50 cal on the top.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>ItÂ’s a wheeled light armoured vehicle. Simple in design, using commercially available automotive components (should not have cost so much in development).<br>It provides a protective transport alternative to seating in soft skin vehicles like 3 tonners.  Possible roles are basic APC for infantry, internal security and weapons platforms.  Seats 4 on each side (total 8 troops), plus a driver in the front. Armoured against 7.62mm rounds and artillery fragments.<br><br></div>
