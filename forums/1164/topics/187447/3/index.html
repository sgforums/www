What comes out of it is anybody`s guess though. Meanwhile, the media is very eager to latch on to almost anything...even a whimper.</div>

Of course, the argument that 'its already happened, so the best you can do is support the re-building to improve the lives of your fellow Muslims' is frequently used against them.<br><br>But seriously, why would you choose to support something now, when you were against it from the very beginning? Any support now would be considered not so much in terms of helping ordinary Iraqis, but more in terms of helping the US.<br><br>If you look at the history of 'the Islamic states' (and I use the term loosely) there has always been more rhetoric and little real unity. It's just unfortunate for the poor Iraqis, but the sentiment remains that the US created the mess, and it should clean it up.<br><br>And fyi... states like Jordan are contributing to the rebuilding. Lots of Iraqi police are trained in Jordan now.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>To be fair, research and development for a capability on ones own requires time and effort which translates to increased cost. Many times, there are trials and errors which also increases cost. After all Malaysia did not have the capability to produced armoured vehicles previously so the ability to do so is something new to them.<br><br>They can get some other company to cooperate with them much like what Singapore did when we develop the Delta frigates. But they wish to do it alone, maybe because of national pride. Another way is to just buy them from overseas. There are many such armoured vehicles in the market now and simply just buying them cost much lesser.<br><br>My personal opinion is that there may be corruption as this have happened before with other government projects as well. And choosing to go alone may mean that all the money can go into the hands of local people.
