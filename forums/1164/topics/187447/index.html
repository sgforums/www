            <div class='col-md body'>Wow, an interesting production. Has it gone itnto full swing production? How many vehicles the MAF plans to accquire? ANi other possible variants?<br><br>I once saw on this Philippines military forum, there was this thread which they mention that the Philippines came up with this 4x4 armoure vehicles. It is claimed to be an improved reverse engineer of the SIMBAS known as "KALAKIAN". I saw the picture, they seem to come out with a turret for their own version of the 40/50 cupuola. I wonder how advance is this vehicle made by our neighbours.........Seriously, aren't they worried abt the ground pressure issue? Why not a tracked one?</div>
