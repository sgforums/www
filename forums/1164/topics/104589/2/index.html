It make use of the lastest technology to make it one of the best.  In fact in amour side, you be surprise, according to some analyst, this is one of the best armour IFV in the world, not just wielding steel but also bolt on classified (laminated type) of armour. Which is already more advance then reactive armour.<br><br>The US tanks and IVF are been destory due to their concept of their relent to send in infranty. You see the whole bundle of soilder all sitting down waiting for tanks ,IFV, helio and planes to take out any enemy unit.<br><br>In urban fighting, the troops must dismount and move forward to protect the IVF, the IVF will in term provide support fire. This is the partnership that will ensure both protect each other. In Iraq, you have the troops more interested in taking cover, which leave the open for enemy to move near enough IFV to take it out with RPGs.<br><br>The 25mm gun is a good option, just right firepower to penetrate most things also combine with 40 GL /0.5 - with the new airburst 40 GL.  Think those 2 combination of IFV is very good for a wide range of situation including urban fighting. Of course 1 or 2 spike missile will help to blow down a buidling faster.<br><br>Someone mention taking out trucks, the 25mm will be the most beauty and effective weapon to take out any trucks or other IFVs compare to missiles. the 25mm rounds have enough penetration to do a lot of damage to most IFV so it will just basically tear up the truck.</div>
