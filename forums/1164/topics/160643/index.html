            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by sgFish:</div><div class="quote_body">somebody translate for us...paiseh my chinese not good &gt;.&lt;</div></blockquote>According to the on-line newest report, Russia will export its newest  SU-30MKK to our country the advanced version SU-30MKK3 fighter bomber, but our neighboring country Korea, also will start to increase buys  F-15k, SU-30MKK3 and F-15k all is in the fighter bomber certainly the  generation of master, then these two kind of minute will be the  different camp between the master, who will battle in the future has  the superiority, who will be able truly to represent the East Asian  fighter plane the most high level, the estimate is the reader is  urgent wants to know, I through the data material which will obtain,  will provide the most real answer for the reader.  First:  SU-30MKK3  is F-15k and same, all was improves the development on the before  mature organism, all will have in the future air fight captures the  air superiority and carries out the depth to the place strike mission  multipurpose fighter bomber.  SU-30MKK3 also retained the Soviet-type  family elegant outlook as well as the airborne mobility, was  outstanding because of the air operated outlook, its air fight  mobility F-15k is stronger, but F - the 15k fighter aircraft overall  layout carried on " the attack hawk " the design, made the suitable  improvement in the structure aspect.  This machine biggest  characteristic is has outside the suspension type conformal fuel tank  under the wing air intake two sides installment.  Enables its maximum  range to achieve 4445 kilometers, this point with emphasizes the great range the SU-30MKK3 difference is not big.  SU-30MKK3 retained  SU-30MKK2 attacks the performance to the place, its maximum total  weight achieved 38, 000 kilograms, caused Soviet -30MKK3 the biggest  limit bomb-carrying capacity to create the recording achieve 12, 000  kilograms, this also is in the present world takes the initiative in  the fighter plane, load biggest, not only surpassed Ã�Â¬ÃƒÃ… fellow  apprentices Soviet -30MKI (8, 000 kilograms) also surpassed United  States military F-15E (11, 113 kilograms), even surpassed the Tu-16  medium range bomber aircraft.  Most more importantly, the Soviet  -30MKK permission in 38, under 000 kilograms limits weights takes off  (full load is completely greasy condition)!  But F-15k also does not  show weakness, the maximum total weight increases to 39 tons from the  E 36.7 tons, the useful load 10442 kilograms, greatest speed 2.5 Mach, the entire machines and tools has 15 precise guided weapon hangs the  ball spot, the weapon hangs the quantity creates the F-15 series  fighter plane, active duty F-15E were more than 6 hangs the ball spot. Has is more intrepid than E attacks the firepower to the place.  The  intrepid performance originates from the advanced engine, SU-30MKK3  uses possibly is Russia " the salute " the factory AL-31-F-M1 engine,  is the AL-3C1f newest advanced version, its biggest thrust  augmentation thrust force by 12, 500 kilograms increases to 13, 240  kilograms, use GE Corporation with F-15k F110 - the GE-129IPE engine  maximum thrust difference are not big, and two all comes under bad  situation, maintains the engine the stability.  But the F-15k engine  general overhaul time is longer than SU-30MKK3.  In the above basic  performance, the motor power, the range, the bomb-carrying capacity  and so on, two masters both display splendidly, the difficult minute  victory and defeat.  Who is stronger, must look below decomposes.  USA takes along it in the radar technology leading superiority, disposed  one four generation of machine radars for three generation of machine  F-15k, causes similarly used Ã�Ã Â¿Ã˜Ã•Ã³ cSu-30MKK3, also to appear  pales by comparison.  The F-15k radar is has the active electronic  scanning array (AESA) antenna APG-63 (V) 2/3, takes in the world first the AESA radar which performs duties on the fighter aircraft,  approximately has 3600 receives and the launch unit, arranges  approaches the square in one on the antenna frame.  APG-63 (V) 2/3 may survey outside 90km the small cruise missile and " stealth airplane ", but on this distance the original F-15c radar only can discover the  conventional size some people drive the fighter aircraft.  Namely the  F-15c original installation radar in the 90km place discovery goal,  says regarding X wave band AESA new radar V2, mays then in 180km place to discover the similar goal.  APG-63 (V) 2/3 radar merit also  continued is increases the function distance and the resolution, more  importantly it had simultaneously tracks the many goals the ability.   Can simultaneously guide 8 AIM-120CC attacks 8 different goals.  The  performance is extremely terrorist.  Compares F-15k terror APG-63 (V)  2/3 radar, the SU-30MKK3 equipment should be SOKOL " Ã¶Ã€ " the radar.   Uses driving electronic scanning, (AESAA) above integrates in its  antenna has approximately 1, 000 x wave cavity T / R module.  The  radar has 3 receivers, transmitter peak value 6KW, average power  1.5KW, has 16 operating frequencies, increases 37 decibels, to 5  square meters airborn targets directly search distances is 150  kilometers, gets down regards the distance 140 kilometers.  ÃŽÂ²Ã—Â· the search distance separately is 60 kilometers (Ã‰Ã�ÃŠÃ“), 55 kilometers  (next regards).  To the bridge survey distance is 150 kilometers, to  the tank colony's survey distance is 25 kilometers.  To the destroyer  survey distance is 300 kilometers.  Its antenna diameter is 980  millimeters, may simultaneously precisely track 12 goals,  simultaneously attacks 4-6 goal.  Two kind of radars both use X wave  band, but former (AESAA) has 3600 launches units on the antenna, but  latter is 1000, in to small and stealth Ã„Â¿Â±ÃªÃŒÂ½Â²Ã¢ aspect, " Ã¶Ã€ "  the type compared to APG-63 (V) 2/3 important duty, in with the multi- goals Â½Ã“Ã•Â½ ability in, " Ã¶Ã€ " the type also is inferior to APG-63  (V) 2/3 except in the radar aspect, SU-30MKK3 and F-15k has besides  the disparity, in surveys to the place, in tracing as well as the  low-level penetration, the F-15k performance is also more prominent.   The F-15k equipment also is the Luo river.  The horse develops " the  tiger eye " for the next generation of fighter plane the /AN/AAQ-13  sensor system, has in the world the most advanced navigation, the  terrain follows, the goal aiming and ÂºÃ¬Ã�Ã¢Ã‹Ã‘Ã‹Ã· and the track (IRST) the ability, the pilot can and Â¶Ã±Ã�Ã“ÃŒÃ¬ÂºÃ² under the condition  carries out the aerial mission in the day and night.  This sensor  system mainly includes the foresight ÂºÃ¬Ã�Ã¢ÂµÂ¼ÂºÂ½ hangs the cabin and  one set of long-distance IRST system.<br><br>Cont'd below..</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Cont'd from above...<br><br>The IRST system search scope  and the radar is close, mainly searches the missile the quantity of  heat which the outer covering produces in the flight process, uses in  to make up the radar survey small goal the insufficiency.  But  SU-30MKK3 equips by the Ural optics machine shop development " Ã“ÃŽÃ¶Ã€  " (sapsan_E) the foresight infrared / photoelectricity / laser target  designation hangs the cabin.  Should hang the cabin internal  installation television camera, the laser rangefinder and the goal  Ã•Ã•ÃƒÃ·Ã†Ã·, laser facula equipment and so on position detector, target  tracking unit, when the airplane makes the big evasion, still had the  full ability guarantee the lock-on target in the field of view.  May  provide the fighter plane to the place / sea level goal search, the  track and the fixed ability;  Controls the precise guided weapon the  launch;  Auxiliary navigation and empty Â¸Â¨Ã–ÃºÂ¸ÃºÃ—Ã™ and so on.  "  Ã“ÃŽÃ¶Ã€ " although the performance is not vulgar, but the resistance  heavy weather ability compares the Luo river.  Horse " tiger eye "  important duty.  Moreover AN/AAQ-13 will provide the manual  ÂµÃ˜Ã�ÃŽÂ¸ÃºÃ—Ã™ ability, evenly will reveal the infrared picture  transmission to the cabin width field of vision, will enable the  airplane to be allowed safely in 30 meters by 1100 kilometers / hour  high speed defense penetration.  (30 meters also that are actually  high on one big tree, are lower than very many missiles are smallest  Ã‰Ã¤Â¸ÃŸ, radar very is also difficult to survey, the  --------------F-15k low-altitude penetration capability too is really  terrorist.)  In the information, two all is loaded with the new wide  band data chain, the real-time transmission, accepts other platforms  the data information.  Provides the aspect to the place firepower,  SU-30MKK3 also must obviously fall behind and F-15k although two all  provides is precisely guides the ammunition, but the F-15k embarkation is uses the GPS guidance the United States military complete set  guided weapon, includes outside the JASSM defense area launches  ammunition /JDAM outside the precise guided bomb /JSOW defense area  guides the ammunition /AGM-142 precise attack shoots /AGM-130  precisely guides the missile.  Hamm anti-radiation vehicle and so on.   These ammunition are greatly many after the actual combat examine,  uses the GPS guidance, the precision is extremely high, the launching  mode is flexible, the very many ammunition have achieved the  intellectualized degree.  But the SU-30MKK3 ammunition still  tradition, includes outside the Kh-59ME defense area the air-to-ground missile (AS-13 " big bolt ", firing distance 285 kilometers), Kh-29  television guidance air-to-ground missile and KAR-500, KAB-1500CKr  guided bomb, Kh-31p anti-radiation vehicle and so on.  Is not  difficult to see F-15k the ammunition diversification, can cope with  each kind of different goal, greatly uses the GPS guidance, is  disturbed slightly, the Russia type ammunition uses the television /  infrared guidance, the medicine is affected under the heavy weather.   Certainly, in the counter- ship combat aspect, the SU-30MKK3 firepower is stronger than F-15k.  Fighter bomber except bombing besides, also  must have the air fight ability, this point, two also all is the  strong point, who lets their initial prototype, is depends on air  fight eating.  Is known as has ultra strong mobile SU-30 develops in  many times the armed force is defeated mobile slightly weak F-15, but  this, the victory and defeat may not be  certain, created F-15k turns  the plate is is four generation of machine developments union hard  helmet aiming systems (JHMCS), took in world one most advanced Ã—Ã¸Â²Ã•  equipment, its conformity each kind of important aircraft-borne data,  wears JHMCS the pilot could only need visually tracks, trivially  decided the short-range goal, pressed down Â°Â´Ã…Â¦ launches AIM-9X mays then, played the electronic game is simpler than, compares says, the  SU-30MKK3 helmet-mounted sight then the tradition, the function few  very. were more  In the electronic countermeasure, SU-30MKK3 equipment KH-3C1p has 200 kilometers firing distances and 3 time of speeds of  sound, this is stronger than F-15k equipment " Hamm ", in the soft  resistance aspect, two differences is not big.  Compared with were  such many, believes who everybody also could see strength stronger,  Korea's F-15k benefits in the very great degree to USA develops the  F-22 item the experience and the technology, was one section typical 3 generation of fuselages,4 generation of machine internal organs  fighter aircrafts, but instead observed SU-30MKK3, although the radar  and so on compared before was more advanced, but as a result of it in  4 generation of machine developments aspects, fell behind to USA,  caused its airborne weapons system performance enemy not to use F-22  technology F-15k, was very big to its overall performance influence.   Moreover is worth paying attention, the F-15k very many advanced  technologies do the full confirmation on F-15E, is extremely reliable, this also was at that time F-15k competes in Korea in the sign defeats SU-35 the important reason.  When the SU-30MKK3 arrival causes we has  the more advanced airborne attack strength, we cuts may not arrogant  general idea, because in ours side distant place, the link does not  give a tongue-lashing group similarly ominous fierce primal chaos "  hawk ".<br><br><span style="color: red;">NOTE: Article have numerous errors as I used Google Language Tool which is in BETA mode.

Su30MK2 is definitely justified  for its price. its exchange rate with F15K is definitely far below 2:1, but the price is almost 2:1!<br><br>Last year, those F15C with JHMCS + AIM9X attended the exercise in India also lost the combat to IAF's Su30K ( Note: NOT more advanced Su30MKI)<br><br>Some other factors play much bigger role in that exercise, because, those F15C without AESA and AWACS support.<br><br>What really counts is though 1 VS 1 , you are better, doesn't mean you will win in a grouped air combat with so many factors need to be considered.</div>
