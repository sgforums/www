A full tank already can get you miles and miles which take you at least 4-5 days to ride in a bicycle ! Even if break off engagement with enemy you still have a chance of running for it.  As for petrol, nowaday everywhere also can get supply.<br><br>You say $200 ? think the army pay more than that for a good bike, so in actual the different between a bicycle and bike is not that much different compare to the benefit of better speed, range and load.</div>

Sure took them a long time to realise that.<br><br>But cycling troops is not completely rubbish. For example they still have ski-equipped mountain troops. Going uphill it is a nuisance to carry you skis. But for level or downhill, nothing beats skiing.<br><br>So too, for Swiss bicycle troops. Going uphill you have to push your bike, but for level and downhill transport, it is beats walking. Of course, as Sorrywolf pointed out, you first have to be proficient at mountainbiking - a skill that can take months to master.<br><br>But the worst thing about cycling is that it forces you to stay on the road, which is why I say it is only good for use away from combat areas.<br><br>And when ambushed, you cannot immediately react if you are on a bicycle. You have to disembark and that would lose valuable seconds. And imagine soldiers trying to run for cover under attack and tripping over abandoned bikes.</div>
