            <div class='col-md body'>Thailand's complicity goes something like this:<br><br>Indochina was a French colony.<br><br>France had fallen to Nazi Germany and is now administered by Nazi puppet called the Vichy French government.<br><br>Thailand had long contested some of the areas under French control.<br><br>Sensing France's weakness, Thailand - which had a modern army and airforce - attacked French Indochina including Laos, Cambodia and Vietnam.<br><br>The war was not very large scale and each side suffered only about 400+ dead and wounded. But this war involved armour, air and naval battles. The French admitted defeat against Thailand's superior forces and asked for peace with Thailand.<br><br>Japan, which already had military bases in French Indochina, came in to negotiate.<br><br>In the end, Japan gained more than Thailand out of the peace deal. They expanded their influence in French Indochina.<br><br>Japan also got agreement from Thailand to assist in Japan's invasion of Malaya. Though Thailand did not keep this promise, they also did not really try to stop Japan either.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote>On December 8, 1941, a few hours after the attack on Pearl Harbor, Japan demanded the right to move troops across Thailand to the Malayan frontier. Japan invaded the country and engaged the Thai army for six to eight hours before Phibun ordered an armistice. Shortly thereafter Japan was granted free passage, and on December 21, 1941, Thailand and Japan signed a military alliance with a secret protocol wherein Tokyo agreed to help Thailand get back territories lost to the British and French colonial powers and Thailand undertook to assist Japan in her war against the Allies.</blockquote><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_Thailand#Military_rule" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_Thailand#Military_rule</a><br><br>Also full details, read here:<br><br><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japanese_Invasion_of_Thailand" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japanese_Invasion_of_Thailand</a></div>

The US, French, Dutch and British Captipulated, with Japan in power of the entire SEA. Britain only managed to hold on to Burma, where they held fiercely, and from the Suez canal, they slowly reinforced India, thus the Japanese did not manage to win in the Indian/ Burma theater.<br><br>1. Their furthest extent being at Papau where they came very close to capturing Port Moresby. However, due to the losses @ the Battle of Coral Sea, invasion plans are stopped and the Japanese never managed to properly supply their troops there - leading to their eventual defeat in the Australia Theater.<br><br>2. Although they did conquer most of South East Asia, I would say that their control only extended to the major cities of SEA. You can never gain full control of forests and jungles.</div>

Thailand was not occupied by the Allies, but it was forced to return the territory it had gained to the British and the French. In the postwar period Thailand enjoyed close relations with the United States, which it saw as a protector from the communist revolutions in neighbouring countries.</blockquote></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by ray243:</div><div class="quote_body">Bloody hell...US involvement in post ww2 SEA sucks...</div></blockquote>I will suggest that you think about it before calling the US influence in SEA "sucks".<br><br>After WW2 and the Japanese defeat, Nationalism and Idealogies such as Communism were high on the people's minds. The former Empires, Britain and France, was exhausted and no longer had the power to fight the various problems of running a colony.<br><br>The Soviet Union and Communism were spreading fast in both Europe and Asia, with half of China already in CCP's control by the end of WW2. Ho Chi Minh was waging a war for independence in Vietnam, using a Socialist Model. So is Gandhi and his Indian Congress Party.<br><br>The US (and I would speculate, UK, France and Australia) feared the rise of Communism in the colonies (or soon to be ex-colonies as most were given independence) and thus the US strengthened ties with Thailand. As history played out, Thailand proved to be an important ally to the US in the Vietnam War, serving as a supply base and R&amp;R for the troops.<br><br>If the US had not involved itself in SEA, then the very place we are living in now will be totally different. Would we be better of or worse of? If we speak in economic terms, then there is a high chance after the initial 10-20 years of growth, income and GDP growth will stagnate (like what happened with the USSR) and eventually the Socialist Model may fail. We might be experiencing similar results to the Eastern Bloc of Europe in 1990, when the USSR slowly disintegrated and the countries left to fend for themselves.</div>

Their furthest extent being at Papau where they came very close to capturing Port Moresby. However, due to the losses @ the Battle of Coral Sea, invasion plans are stopped and the Japanese never managed to properly supply their troops there - leading to their eventual defeat in the Australia Theater.</div></blockquote>Quite right.  And you know, the Japanese aren't dumb and it would have dawned upon their IJN planners long before the campaign that they luck the necessary naval force to defend their conquests from an allied counter-offensive.<br><br>The Japanese preferrence for a decisive battle doesn't stem from blind and inflexible belief in the Mahan doctrine but rather recognization of their own weakness.  They could in the early stages of the war stand a chance of knocking out the allied forces at sea that fight a protracted war of attrition whereby her paltry merchant shipping would be dwarfed by the US' resources.<br><br>So it was either at best a 50-50 chance of winning or a 100% guarantee of lost.  Either way prospects didn't look so good.</div>
