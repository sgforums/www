            <div class='col-md body'>Who are the people in Malaya and Singapore who helped China during WW2 ? did your grandfathers give any money to the United China relief or the national war fund? If you have no affiliation whatsoever to China, why do you expect China to come to your aid when you are in trouble?<br><br>If Singapore were attacked someday, we would be hoping for international intervention from all friendly nations. We hope our weapons suppliers, especially the american, would rush to us the ammunition we need for the war, what aid do we need from China? Contribution to the United Singapore Relief Fund?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_redface.gif" alt="Embarassed" title="Embarassed"> that I believe there will be more contribution from China than from any other country.<br><br>In the unlikely event that Singapore were overrun by our enemy, there will be an american carrier here to evacuate, first the american, than the citizens from other angmohs countries. The Japanese and Koreans would have to evacuate their citizens too, and of course the Chinese, naval vessels from PRC and ROC. If you are not already on safe ground by then, what choice have you got but hope that any vessel, including one from PRC, would take you and your family to safety?<br><br>You will be lucky if you can land safely on Hainan island before you move on to country of your choice, if you have the means. Or do you prefer the Philippines or Vietnam, or may be India, if the rescue vessels go west?<br><br>You can continue to dream of holding a british passport, but then what is so bad about a PRC passport if you can stay in HK?<br><br>The better hope is still to ensure that Singapore cannot be overrun by our enemy. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"></div>

The definition of Culture should be the same for east and west but learn about Chinese culture from the chinese, or talk to some westerners in China or Taiwan, those who speak Chinese.<br><br>All Chinese, agree, including those from PRC, that cultural revolution is a national catastrophe for China and it brought back Chinese civilization by 20 years.

US. US has done all those things and more.<br><br>And about Darfur... it's about oil. And from what I understand about the situation there. UN has not classified it as "Genocide", only the US and media does. If you're well-read and divert from American controlled media.. you will learn that it was US (thru Uganda and Chad proxies) are reponsible for the latest conflict. US proxies trained and supplied the Rebels, who incidentally, are also guilty as all the crimes done by the janjaweed, attacked the govt troops and won almost every battle. While Collin Powers was in UN selling WMD in Iraq and 'Genocide' in Sudan. Well before even the Janjaweed entered the pic. The US even openly stated they want a regime change. Almost all the the news out there are giving one-sided reporting, even the UN investigator (US citizens), were all one-sided.

Can you name how many US puppet dictators and ally was backstabbed.. when they out-lived their usefulness. Let's see, Milosevic, Noriego, Saddam, Pinochet, hmong, Kurds.. etc. In the 80's, even Lee Kwan Yew was suspected of being targeted for regime change.. until we totally accept and became a pro-US satelite of sort, WTO, IMF, chewing gum and Gay issues. It all so the greater good for US foreign Interest. Hardly a trusted ally.<br><br>While, there are things that leaves us suspicious of China.. but if you look at China past foriegn actions.. they usually mean what they say.. even to Russia and US.

Singapore also turned down the offer by Teng Xiao Peng to train our troops in Yunnan and Guangxi province to avoid having any possible misinterpretation of our relationship with China. ASEAN is not made up of Chinese, no Chinese in any ASEAN country ever tried to give that impression. But Mahathir ever tried to advocate the use of Malay/Indonesian language as the official language of ASEAN because by population, more people in ASEAN speak Malay/Indonesian than any other language. Why should there be any fear for the chinese?<br><br>About ASEAN solidarity, the ball is not in our court. We are but a small dot to our ASEAN neighbours. We can talk till cow comes home about putting aside difference, until our neigbours see that they need ASEAN, see the need to cooperate, the need to be united.....but will they ever see such a need, even in their own country?<br><br>Honestly, if the elites in all these countries care for their own countrymen, especially the minority race, these people will not have to hope for outside help, China or USA.
