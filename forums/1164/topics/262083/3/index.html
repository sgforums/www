            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by sgdiehard:</div><div class="quote_body">The fact that Singapore was the last ASEAN nation to establish diplomatic relationship with China is clear that Singapore never play the Chinese card. Singapore also turned down the offer by Teng Xiao Peng to train our troops in Yunnan and Guangxi province to avoid having any possible misinterpretation of our relationship with China. ASEAN is not made up of Chinese, no Chinese in any ASEAN country ever tried to give that impression. But Mahathir ever tried to advocate the use of Malay/Indonesian language as the official language of ASEAN because by population, more people in ASEAN speak Malay/Indonesian than any other language. Why should there be any fear for the chinese?<br><br>About ASEAN solidarity, the ball is not in our court. We are but a small dot to our ASEAN neighbours. We can talk till cow comes home about putting aside difference, until our neigbours see that they need ASEAN, see the need to cooperate, the need to be united.....but will they ever see such a need, even in their own country?<br><br>Honestly, if the elites in all these countries care for their own countrymen, especially the minority race, these people will not have to hope for outside help, China or USA. But you expect their elites to look after the minority? not even in Singapore. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_redface.gif" alt="Embarassed" title="Embarassed">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green">    </div></blockquote>Maybe I wasn't clear.<br><br>We may be small, but there are other areas which, in times of crisis, will ensure that we gain the upper hand in ASEAN due to certain capabilities we have that they don't.<br><br>Don't mistake the size of Malaysia and Indonesia for strength. From what I see, they cannot defend ASEAN against many things.</div>

But emphasis of the traditional ties.  I am always wonder which social report or what undesirable factors that give an about turn to gov policy from developing nation identity to tradditional social identity.<br><br>The newly arrived immigrant are more educated and more culturely diversed.
