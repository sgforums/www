            <div class='col-md body'>China is not one of the practitioners of traditional real-politik. It applies high principles and ideals in international diplomacy. Notice it did invade Vietnam to punish the Vietnamese for invading its friend (Kampuchea). It retreated when its aims were met. And it also poured volunteers into Korea right after fighting a disastrous civil war, although in this case its interests were clearly at stake. When you have a friend that will risk an arm and a leg for you, in good times or bad,  is it not the best ally you can ever have?</div>

From their perspective :<br><br>As a nation we opposed the communist in the 60's  that they will remember. To really talk about WWII i think you are pushing it.<br><br>As people we are to them -  In the past we are all from "China"  there is no such thing as "Singaporean" ,  but later i think those who socialized with us come to a conclusion that we are oversea chinese decent who lost our roots.<br><br>(but I think recent years that has change)<br><br>So to talk about ties i don't think they will come to rescue unless of econcomic and political interest.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>One thing is for sure. The PRC is very concerned about the plight of overseas Chinese in recent years even though these ethnic Chinese are not their citizens. Take for example the May riots in Jarkarta in which the ethnic Chinese are deliberately targeted. The men and women are raped and killed. Their properties ransacked and torched. Thousands of these Indonesia Chinese fled to neighbouring countries in particular Singapore.<br><br>If i am not wrong the PRC government issued a statment and the semi-government organisations voice violent protest and condemnation.

            <div class='col-md body'>Yea I think they will do something... but to fight... and send peopel to die for us is another story...<br><br>We are a Chinese dominent country definitely will do something but to how much the amount...<br><br>China is concern of the plight of all Chinese around the world. Extend of help it will put in is another issue. It will also depends on our ties with China.<br><br>China did issue a statement during the Indonesia riot. But little much he can do. Can't really expect China to get involve with military at this point of time. Doesn't want the world to see China as a big aggressor. What about Singapore? We are near and has the ability to help. We does little too than just accepting the Chinese to come Singapore.<br><br>WWII simply becoz most of the locals are from China. Most Chinese still considered China as their homeland and expect to return one day. Nowadays new generation of Chinese in SG would rather die in SG.
