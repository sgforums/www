When I tried using my 300mm at AA with the Pig doing its Dump and Burn the entire aircraft and flame filled the frame of my photo with lots of room to spare. And of course, the Pig is not a small aircraft by any stretch of the imagination. At least, its quite a lot bigger than the 3 I've spoken of.<br><br>PS.

            <div class='col-md body'>Sunday's dump and burn as a real disappointment...it lasted only like 2-3 seconds or so..all my friends who were expecting that stunt was turned down...few of them got it on camera/videocam.<br>Saturday's one was much better and the duration was longer.Guess they ran out of fuel to dump and burn on Sunday, considering it was the last day of the airshow lol<br><br>Anyways i saw a very interesting sight this morning while having PE at the track.That same F-111 was flying over my college near yio chu kang, presumably going back to its home base in Aust.First of all it was preceded by a loud rumbling noise which made me swivel my head around and scan the skies; coz the sound was definitely not local. It was a majestic sight when i finally spotted it through the puffs of clouds and i guess i was lucky to see it for the last time before it went back home.<br><br>Hats off to the Aussie fighter pilots !</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>well, its a correct move by caas to keep planes out at a safe distance. years after Ramstein, there are still accidents at airshows and people are still being killed.  the sea location is good, anything happens the pilot got alot of space to ditch the plane and clear away from the crowd.<br><br>flying over the sea is not easy, the chances of dis orientation is higher. the sea looks grey and in a fighter jet with little time for reaction. the pilot can easily mistaken the sea for a cloudy sky and vice versa.<br><br>on one of the previous airshow, i notice that the mirage pilot continue to roll to correct as it seems that he got disoriented and assume he was heading for the sea and not the sky. lucky its just for a second and he roll back again.<br><br>well if you cannot photograph the plane properly, i suggest you get a better telephoto. i used to shot at 300mm but i realise that in order to reach the planes u need at least  a 400 mm, in those days 400mm is expensive. nowadays with digital slr with its got magnification due to smaller ccd, an eos 10d with a 400mm will give u 520mm.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>cavsg, airshow rules were tightened in W Europe and US after Ramstein. Current rules make for safer shows, but not to the point of sterility.  For starters, at least you can see the plane performing clearly with your naked eye.Theres still risk involved, but a risk free airshow is an oxymoron.<br><br>Acrobatics with the performers pointing their noses at the crowd were prohibited, which was something the Ukranians forgot when the Flanker pranged in 2003.<br><br>As for equipment, upgrades are out of my reach at the moment, I'm just a poor engineer. I'll probably spring for a 400 or 500mm in time for Avalon 2005 (hope Geoff Moesker brings Hunter 503 or better yet, 536 there again). Still a traditional slide photographer when it comes to birds<br><br>BTW, how much is an EOS 10D nowadays?<br></div>
