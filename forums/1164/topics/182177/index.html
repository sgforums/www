            <div class='col-md body'>I live in the UK but only caught a few episodes ( may be 3 at most).  I notice that they have female operatives... one is a MO and the other is an operator.  It is quite realistic in terms of scenarios and locations ( I know because I have been to some of the buildings that were filmed).  But as the series got older, their storyline became more unbelievable. Perhaps they were running out of ideas ???<br><br>There is a new drama series featuring MI6 , the British secret service , called " Spooks". This one also has a lot of action but from the secret service viewpoint. But the storylines now are getting too fantastic.</div>
