            <div class='col-md body'>erm, well if I'm allowed to imagine. I figure its pretty much the same way computer hardware works.  IE. Drivers.<br><br>Previously, hardware devices weren't all plug and play.  Hence a driver is required to help interface the device to the computer.  Eg, say you bought some really cool multi button optical mouse 2 years ago.  U need to install the mouse software before u can use it.  Its all about bridging the interface, from the human user, to the device, to the computer, to binary bits.<br><br>Im guessing it works similarly with aircraft weapon systems components.  Though the aircraft purchas is stated to be capable of using certain weapons, source codes ( smth like drivers ) must be loaded to "tell" the jet's computer how to use it.<br><br>When M'sia first bought their bugs, together with them, came Harpoons, Mavericks, Sidewinders and Sparrows.  There was no mention of any PGMs like laser guided bombs(except mavericks).  In fact, there was no mention of any kinda bombs... Perhaps this suggests that their Hornet's air to surface capability is limited to Harpoons and Mavericks?? I find it a bit hard to believe... surely it must have retained some ability to drop some Mk-82-84s...?<br><br>Part 1 was just guessing on my part.  Since the Israelis operated F-16s too, particularly, Block 50/52s, we most probably would have gotten some codes from them to integrate weapons such as the python4, (who knows, even derbys).  With the new Block 60, i'm sure there will be vast changes in the jet's computer architecture since its supposedly using a faster processor.  Hence, for the RSAF to buy and use the F-16 Block 60, would prolly leave us wondering how to integrate our "other" weapons with it.<br><br>On the other hand, the F-15Es, would come already capable of a wide variety of roles, + the IAF is already operating their locally modified version of the Strike Eagle, we still might have the option of getting their help with integrating  "other" weapons with it.  But damn... the Strike Eagles, the way things look at the moment are already very capable!</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Oops, sorry.<br><br>I hope they don't take us too seriously and really try using sea skuas as torpedoes.  Our submarines are REALLY vulnerable to falling sea skuas!!!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_confused.gif" alt="Confused" title="Confused"><br><br>Another thing.<br><blockquote>The issue first came to a head when the Malaysian air force purchased 18 of the Mikoyan MiG-29SD/N fighter in 1993 and specifically requested that its Phazotron N019 radar set would be upgraded to permit firing of the R-77. But more than a decade laterÂ–despite an agreement in the late 1990s to upgrade the Malaysian fleet with the R-77Â–it has yet to happen. Then late last year, Malaysia signed a contract for the delivery of 18 Sukhoi Su-30MKM fighters and it is assumed that it is only a matter of time before Malaysia does take the R-77 into its inventory.</blockquote>So up til now, the Malaysian Fulcrums are unable to launch adders? Doesnt that limit their BVR capability to the F/A-18's Sparrows and Alamos?<br><br>Makes me curious, are they gonna take delivery of their Adders or not... as well as what other missiles and bombs are coming along with their Flanker package.</div>
