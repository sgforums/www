They have better pool of talent and Technology in terms of military wise. Like China,they try to emphasize on self-reliant and have a military industries! Iran can produce their MBT,ARV,SSM,SAM,Assault-Rifle,Manpad,Fast Attack craft! They have the abilities to understand or modify their aircraft to their requirement,although to what extend,I'm not sure! They even make a F-14 able to fire a Hawk SAM as AOA missiles.(But propable an experimental one)<br><br>While for Malaysia? ZERO!!! Even their proton Saga is a cheap buy off the self from Mitsubishi out-dated model! They even need to buy in Lotus shares to help them develop their so call home grown car... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">  I wouldn't be suprise they can do a sh*t abt their F/A-18s.
