            <div class='col-md body'>As most of you would have already realise that the Eurofighter Typhoon will not be coming for the Asian Aerospace except for a full scale replica.However,the F-15 and Rafale will be here for an air show. Does this means that the Typhoon is out of the race to replace our A4 Super skyhawks? I come to this conclusion because they may no longer be intrested in the deal with Singapore and thus the lack of intrest in provided a real plne for the exhibition. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>It does not mean anything, the Typhoon never flies anyway except Farnborough and Le Bourget.<br><br>It's been Eurofighter's policy for years not to send the aircraft to Singapore Aerospace. Just a stupid mock-up.<br><br>Anyway, Rafale F3 development contract has been signed last week, finally securing the final a2g upgrades for the plane. For the Typhoon well the member countries are again rumoured to be reducing their orders, so I think you can forget about having significant a2g capabilities on that plane in time for Singapore requirements.<br><br>Bottom line is... go for Rafale.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>

            </div>
            <div class='col-md body'>My personal opinion is that the RSAF will go for a new generation plane such as the Rafale and that Typhoon instead of the F-15s. Reason being that the F-15s are almost near to the end of further upgrades or developments as compared to a new plane which have lots more developmental potential. This is because, Singapore will almost always do upgrades or modification to the aircraft being  bought. Examples:F-16A/B,F-5S,A-4SU etc. We are also providing the service of upgrading planes for other countries such as the F-5s for the ROC airforce. Therefore, i predict that RSAF will choose a new geneartion plane for its latest technology and also for the prospect of making money out of upgrading and modifying planes for other countries in the future. My bet is the Typhoon because of the numerous orders and its state of the art technology such as voice controlled instruments in the cockpit.Thanks <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"><br>PS; the B-1B is NOT short-listed for the current replacement for the  A-4SU unlike the Typhoon,Rafale and F-15s. Therefore there is totally NO chance of us getting the B-1Bs any time soon,right?</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I personally feel that the B1-B will be 'given' free to RSAF and based in Changi. They will replace the S211s  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"> as they can now conduct flying classes in sizes of 30s.<br><br>ST Aerospace is now configuring ejections seats to fit into the bomb bays. BTW they eject towards the ground...... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"> so there will be additional savings as there's no requirements for zero zero ejection.<br><br>F-15 is actually more flexible to upgrades as it has the biggest airframe of all three contenders. No need to take out one 20mm gun  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_eek.gif" alt="Shocked" title="Shocked"> for extra mission computer like in F5 etc.<br><br>F-15 actually uses engines of the same core as that of the F-16s.<br><br>F-15 has evolved from a pure interceptor into a true multi-role figther.<br><br>Rafale and Typhoon MAY have more advanced black boxes and weapons integrated......but FOR AN INTERIM SOLUTION it's a bloody waste of money!<br><br>So too for the F-15!<br><br>In the end there can only be one answer -&gt; more F-16s. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_twisted.gif" alt="Twisted Evil" title="Twisted Evil"><br><br>The only thing that ground the F-16 is engine trouble like the blade problem in the JT-15 turbofan of the S211.......<br><br>This you can avoid as the F-16 has a dual engine bay.<br><br>The fuselage problem can be avoided if you stagger the flying hours through careful planning.<br><br>Money saved can then be deposited in my savings account.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br><br>Ok, I'll share it with Renci - only because Kym Ng doesn't belong in a crash helmet!. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>According to Show Daily, one of the mags I picked up today at AA2004, one article stated that the Typhoon will "undertake more than 100 hours of flying, as part of this activity (referring to the system evaluation flights by RSAF for each of the contender aircraft), most of it in Singapore later this year."<br><br>Also, Mark Ritson, BAE Systems Director of Marketing Communications Asia, said, "we are delighted that Typhoon will be making its first ever Asia appearance in the skies over Singapore later this year...."<br><br>So it'll be coming after all, but not now....</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Dassault and Boeing have announced that they will be sticking around after the AA2004 is over to "proof" that their birds can adapt well to local tropical weather.  Dassault says they will be bringing in a single seater Rafale to complement the twin-sitter and Boeing says two F15s will remain behind and follow suit.<br><br>BAe says that a real Eurofighter will be making its maiden voyage out from European skies this late June to July and I think will most probably carry out similar flight evaluation trials like the F15 and Rafale.  That is, if they really decide to come.</div>

'In the first stage, we intend to acquire between eight and 12 aircraft, with the remainder to be acquired over the subsequent five years,' said a spokesman.<br><br>Defence contractors vying for the deal are pulling out all the stops for what could well be the last major fighter deal in the Asia-Pacific this decade.<br><br>Mindef's evaluation is now at a crucial stage. The upcoming flight tests are designed in part to convince Mindef that the warplanes work as advertised in Singapore weather.<br><br>As such, French defence contractor Dassault is sending a single-seat Rafale to join the twin-seater already here, for the intensive flight trials lasting about three weeks.<br><br>Two F-15s are also expected to remain here for similar trials.<br><br>The Typhoon could not make it down for the airshow, as the few Typhoons produced are still being evaluated by air forces in Britain, Germany, Italy and Spain, explained a BAE Systems spokesman. But it will be seen over Singapore skies around June for the trials, in its first trip outside Europe.<br><br>He said: 'While we would be delighted to see Europe's newest swing role combat aircraft displaying alongside established airshow stalwarts such as F-16, F-15 and Rafale, our priorities must lie with the evaluation programme.'<br><br>At the airshow yesterday, the marketing men from three companies were hard at work. Mr Thomas Lillis, Asia-Pacific director of Boeing's integrated defence system, minced no words when he said the F-15 was clearly superior to its rivals and 'has proven itself in combat'. He said 48 F-15s destroyed 60 per cent of Saddam Hussein's elite Republican Guard division during the Iraq war last year.<br><br>Selling the F-15's range and speed, he added: 'We're faster, we go farther and we carry more (weapons)... From a customer who wants to use this airplane either as a deterrent or in actual combat, it's pretty lethal.'<br><br>The Typhoon may not be battle-tested, but its makers hope to swing the deal by pledging that 'export customers' may be allowed to make certain components of the plane.<br><br>'We're prepared to give a full technology transfer,' said Mr Mike Rouse, group marketing director at BAE Systems, who explained that this sweetener would bring top-tier aerospace know-how to the customer's aviation industry.<br><br>The significance of deal sweeteners has not been lost on the French, who have indicated that Singapore could develop an advanced radar for the Rafale - if it bought the aircraft.<br><br>Other incentives would include greater access to air force training areas in France, where an RSAF A-4 training squadron is already based.<br><br>Mindef's intention to announce a winner next year means Asian Aerospace 2004 will be the last chance for the three plane makers to woo the home crowd.<br><br>The result: four F-15 Strike Eagles at the airshow (the largest ever contingent of F-15s at the event), piles of colourful warplane posters, glossy brochures, CDs with plane images, and an assortment of aircraft keepsakes like pins, caps, badges and scarfs to keep souvenir hunters happy.<br><br>The Rafale and F-15 will also take to the skies off Changi Point during the airshow's daily aerial display to show off their manoeuvrability. Catch them between 11.30am and 1pm till Saturday and between 11.30am and 1.10pm on Sunday.</div>

We can either buy more F100 spare engines but its not feasible to buy spare GE engines.  </div></blockquote>Hey I get it ...... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"><br><br>What I'm actually proposing as an alternative to NGF is have a mixed fleet of F-16s....since present fleet is on PWs we should increase more new F-16s with GEs<br><br>Much more cost effective than getting a new aircraft altogether not to mention getting a VIRGIN NEW European one!<br><br>We ran the A-4s for almost 30 years! We can do it again with the F-16s too.

            <div class='col-md body'>Again its not cost effective to have a fleet of F-16s of which half running on PW engines and the other half GE engines, then you'll have to setup two different sets of Intermediate level engine workshops and either train two groups of technicians to service each engine type.  You must keep in mind of the logistical requirements, its not as easy as buying a car.<br><br>p.s.  The government need not find oil, they just have to increase the GST  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz"></div>
