Heard it was so had so heavy an armour it moved quite slowly but other then that had superior fire power and could destroy ANYTHING.However it was too costly that germany could only afford to make 100 plus (I think).</div>

Quoting from wikipedia: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/M1_Abrams" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/M1_Abrams</a><br><br><blockquote>The tank can be fueled with diesel fuel, kerosene, any grade of MOGAS (motor gasoline), or JP-4 or JP-8 jet fuel; the U.S. Army uses JP-8 jet fuel in order to simplify logistics.</blockquote>That said, the biggest issue that the Abrams has is definitely its gas turbine. It high-temperature exhaust makes it difficult for infantry to run behind it for protection in urban areas.<br><br>It also has a high rate of fuel consumption. Heck, you need 40 liters of fuel just to start up the turbine.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"></div>
