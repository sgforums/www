            <div class='col-md body'>Both the Challenger 2 and the M1A2 uses Chobham.  The M1A1HAs and A2s have an additional layer of DU in their armor.  It increases protection rating and weight as well.<br><br>Rifled vs Smoothbore.<br>Mainly a difference in doctrine.  The British prefers to use their HESH rounds as anti-armor and anti-fortification round.  Hence they retain the rifled gun for superior accuracy when using the HESH.<br><br>The rifled gun loses effectiveness with other rounds such as the APFSDS and HEAT.  Spin imparted on the long rod penetrator reduces the accuracy and penetration ability to the APFSDS I think.  As for the HEAT, a spin on the HEAT round would cause the explosive stream to break up, losing penetration ability critically.   Hence, when firing these rounds from the rifled gun, the rounds themselves are encased in another casing that spins while the actual round within does not.  That spells, higher manufacturing costs for the rounds. Rifled guns themselves require more maintenance.<br><br>As for the Smoothbore, they handle the APFSDS and HEAT as they are with great accuracy as well. However, most armies using smoothbore guns for their tanks do not use HESH rounds as primary anti armor rounds.<br><br>PS: Notice no french tanks were mentioned in the Top 10.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Monster Nazi Panzer!<br><br><blockquote>Maus is the name of the largest tank design ever built. Designed in 1942 by Ferdinand Porsche under direct order from Adolf Hitler. The Maus would have had a crew of either 5 or 6. The tank's hull was 10.1 meters long, 3.67 meters wide and 3.66 meters tall. Weighing 188 tons, the Maus was armed with a 128mm cannon and a coaxial 75mm gun, and covered with 180-240mm of armor. Only two were produced. One was destroyed by the Germans at Kummersdorf to prevent its capture by the Soviets, and the sole surviving Maus tank is currently in the Kubinka Tank Museum in Russia. Nine others were in various stages of completion when the war ended. None ever saw combat.</blockquote>Pics<br><a href="http://www.panzer.punkt.pl/artykuly/maus/maus_01.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://www.panzer.punkt.pl/artykuly/maus/maus_01.jpg</a><br><br><a href="http://www.panzer.punkt.pl/artykuly/maus/maus_010.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://www.panzer.punkt.pl/artykuly/maus/maus_010.jpg</a><br><br><a href="http://www.achtungpanzer.com/images/maus_77.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://www.achtungpanzer.com/images/maus_77.jpg</a><br><br><a href="http://www.achtungpanzer.com/images/maus_1.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://www.achtungpanzer.com/images/maus_1.jpg</a><br><br><a href="http://www.achtungpanzer.com/images/cmaus.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://www.achtungpanzer.com/images/cmaus.jpg</a><br><br><a href="http://www.panzer.punkt.pl/artykuly/maus/maus_09.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://www.panzer.punkt.pl/artykuly/maus/maus_09.jpg</a><br><br>Source: <a href="http://www.panzer.punkt.pl/strony_www/maus.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.panzer.punkt.pl/strony_www/maus.htm</a><br><br>This is a Porsche monster tank which did get into production but not used in combat.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"></div>

Perhapes our army wants a tank that it can show the world and boost citizen morale? Personally, I wouldn't want to buy a tank and keep it under wraps for 20 years either.</div>

You don't need a tank to kill a tank. A tank that big a walking target for aerial assault man. Can you imagine, all that resources blown to crap by American CAS.</div>
