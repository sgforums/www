            <div class='col-md body'>The origin of the US National Anthem:<br><br><span class="small"><span style="color: blue;">During the War of 1812, on September 13, 1814, Francis Scott Key visited the British fleet in Chesapeake Bay to secure the release of Dr. William Beanes, who had been captured after the burning of Washington DC.<br><br>The release was secured, but Key was detained on ship overnight during the shelling of Fort McHenry, one of the forts defending Baltimore.<br><br>In the morning, he was so delighted to see the American flag still flying over the fort that he began a poem to commemorate the occasion.<br><br>Entitled "The Star Spangled Banner", the poem soon attained wide popularity as sung to the tune "To Anacreon in Heaven".<br><br>The origin of this tune is obscure, but it may have been written by John Stafford Smith, a British composer born in 1750.<br><br>"The Star Spangled Banner" was officially made the National Anthem by Congress in 1931, although already adopted as such by the Army and Navy. </span></span><br><br><a href="http://www.star-spangled-site.com/usa_ant.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.star-spangled-site.com/usa_ant.htm</a><br><br>The national anthem of a Country reflects the cultural, social and political experiences shared by the peoples in the Country.<br><br>Malay was declared one of the four official languages - as stated in our Constitution.<br><br>Although this lip service was made, not much else was done to promote the study of Malay language since the 1970's - although there was Government incentive for Civil Servants to master written and spoken Malay during the late 1960's.<br><br>Unfortunately, the unspoken and suppressed "disdain" towards the Malay way continues with the present Political Leadership in all its policies - from National Service to Education, to Political Appointments.<br><br>This has resulted in the feelings of some - like "Tripwire" - to question the relevance of a National Anthem written in a language that is little understood by most Singaporeans, and therefore has little meaning or relevance - (especially when compared with a national anthem such as proudly shared and supported by diverse ethnic groups that form the US citizenry).<br><br>Be as it may, "Majullah Singapura" is reflective of Singapore, with our unique declaration of equality of all its peoples, regardless of race, language or religion, as enshrined in the Singapore Constitution.<br><br>The lyrics of "Majullah Singapura" expresse our unique transition to independence, in a period when Singapore was kicked out of Malaysia because of the "politics of race" that was practised during the short period when Singapore was part of Malaysia.<br><br>This unique call to be together and move forward was penned by a Malay musician, and we should respect this person's effort by continuing to sing it as it was originally written - in a language that we recognised as equal amongst the other languages that make us uniquely Singaporean.<br><br></div>

Anyone out there that suggest that we can the anthem or lyrics into English obviously have a lack of appreciation for the national anthem. We need to ask ourselves whether do we need to change just because most of us cannot understand or speak Malay. If the answer is yes, that is pretty shallow. The national anthem and flag is a symbol of the country. This is what we are.
