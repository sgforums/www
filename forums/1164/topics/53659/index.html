However officials say young people no longer fully appreciate its lyrics, which include references to "the land where my blood flows", "our king safely crowned" and "citizens living united and progressive".<br><br>Advertisement<br><br>The proposed changes to the anthem, called "Negaraku" or "My Country," would be the most dramatic to the Malay-language piece since Malaysians began singing it when the country achieved independence from Britain in 1957.<br><br>The anthem's title would remain unchanged but its opening line is expected to be changed from "My country" to "My Malaysia," said Mr Wah Idris, a prominent composer whom the government chose to develop the revisions.<br><br>The changes -- which are still subject to approval by Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad's Cabinet -- are likely to include a more rousing rhythm but no adjustments to the melody, which is based on a traditional Malay folk song, Mr Wah told The Associated Press.<br><br>The remodeled version will be officially launched during National Day celebrations on Aug 31, the Utusan Malaysia newspaper reported, adding that the changes were "meant to inject a deeper love for the country".<br><br>Officials have tried to update the anthem once before -- in 1992 -- to make it more upbeat. but the revamped version was criticised for sounding too much like a pop song, and the more stately version eventually returned to favour. -- AP<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>i spent time as a student in the states and envy the way those people there cherish their anthem 'star-spangled banner'. Always playing it at the start of basketball, football &amp; baseball games..and everyone standing up doing some full-throated singing. Hearing them, i can almost imagine, back then, that the anthem, the way it is written and sung, reminds them of who they are and makes them proud to be red, white &amp; blue <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Sometimes, I think the reason why I am holding back and not singing our National Anthem whole-heartedly is because it is in Malay.<br><br>I don't have anything against the Malay language, but it is a fact that most Singaporeans do not understand Malay, even if there is a translation, the person singing will not be able to grasp the full meaning.<br><br>I think it is time to change it to English, so that we can all fully appreciate what we are singing, which I think is the essence of having a anthem in the first place.<br><br></div>

BUT the question here is NOT about those "mercenaric" people... but the National anthem...  isit performing its pre-dedicated functions as a NATIONAL ANTHEM?<br><br>i believe most people... if not everyone knew that... after the 911 incident.. singapore held a vigil at the national stadium for the victims and many americans as well as singaporeans (mainly singaporeans) were present... the event was live telecasted too...<br><br>NOW... when the american national anthem came on... you can here the resonance as the americans sang with pride, strength and determination... united in voice and spirit to their country's call....<br><br>WHEN... Majulah singapura came on...... ehh..... all i here is the music..... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cry.gif" alt="Crying or Very sad" title="Crying or Very sad">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cry.gif" alt="Crying or Very sad" title="Crying or Very sad">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cry.gif" alt="Crying or Very sad" title="Crying or Very sad">  there are no echoes... a few whimper, the TV shows the PM open and close his mouth like a goldfish.... and thats it....<br><br>the difference is like heaven and earth......   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"></div>

NOW... lets not be emotional here... just plain logics....<br><br>I also wish to note that "majulah singapura" was not supposed to be a NATIONAL ANTHEM when it was created.... am i wrong??<br><br>as someone noted... how proud the americans sang their national anthems... how the national anthem brings forth their patriotism AND UNITE the people under the flag...<br><br>DID "majulah singapura" achieve the same effect... or has it failed...<br><br>if it is successful... then its ok....<br><br>BUT if it has failed... whats the purpose of keeping a broken recorder?</div></blockquote>Studying the lyrics of our national anthem, it's basically an exhortation for the people to unite for the common good. To be really honest, the meaning while noble doesn't inspire passion that comes from a rooted sense of identity and destiny. Below is the english translation:<br><br><span style="color: red;">Come, fellow Singaporeans<br><br>Let us progress towards happiness together<br><br>May our noble aspiration bring<br><br>Singapore success<br><br>Come, let us unite<br><br>In a new spirit<br><br>Let our voices soar as one<br><br>Onward Singapore<br><br>Onward Singapore</span><br><br>Please pardon me as I've not made a study of other anthems other than the star spangled banner so my comments are biased. Produced below is the first stanza of the star spangled banner"<br><br><span style="color: blue;">'Oh, say, can you see, by the dawn's early light,<br>What so proudly we hail'd at the twilight's last gleaming?<br>Whose broad stripes and bright stars, thro' the perilous fight,<br>O'er the ramparts we watch'd, were so gallantly streaming?<br>And the rockets' red glare, the bombs bursting in air,<br>Gave proof thro' the night that our flag was still there.<br>O say, does that star-spangled banner yet wave<br>O'er the land of the free and the home of the brave?'</span><br><br>Even at a superficial reading, you'll likely note that the song already speaks of a tumultous history (during the revolution against the brits). It gives people a sense of destiny when you remind them of how the country overcame incredible odds in the past. It also speaks of the best in its people as 'brave' and remind them to always cherish liberty.<br><br>Having said that, i must say that 'Majulah Singapura' is my national anthem, and whenever its being played, i do feel tugs of patriotic feelings in my heart, in spite of the plain lyrics.<br><br></div>
