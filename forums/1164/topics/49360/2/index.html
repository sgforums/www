            <div class='col-md body'>As far as I know, now there are no restrictions on the vocations that a female can take. (exept maybe the commandos)<br><br>I personally know of female tankees (VCs and PCs) and (1) female AI. Arty is old story, Infantry quite long ago<br><br>Really, I think it's OK for females to serve in arty and armour (tankees), the "push-button -build-bridge" engineers.<br><br>But I really doubt if females can serve in the infantry and armoured infantry. It's not that I doubt their ability to fight (history is full of examples); I doubt their ability to march. Can they march  8km in an hour with weapon and fullpacks then conduct a hasty defense or attack??<br><br>OK, there are <span style="font-style: italic;">some</span> that can, but we must make sure that only these some make it thru.<br><br>There must be no lowering of standards for females. Currently females run a modified SOC (w/o SBO and weapon, skip some obstacles, same timing) but this test of combat fitness must be the same for both sexes.<br><br>Sama-sama for all other training standards....<br><br>Hey, what happened to the female combat trainers ah? Nvr saw one in my time...<br><br>I'll love to see an all female tank platoon. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"> Given that females or more co-operative and less competitive, maybe that'll give them an advantage...</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>wah... this topic i started seems to be quite a debate huh? haha... well, one thing's for sure, what the guys can do, the girls can do too... in areas they lack, like physical strength, they make up for it with their cooperativeness and other qualities uncommon in guys lah... somehow, if a platoon leader is a girl, i got a feeling that the men in the platoon might fight harder to prove that they are more superior than the female pc lah... afterall, they wouldn't want to paiseh lah... but this can lead to other problems like insubordination lah...the guys may not like to follow orders from female commanders...</div>
