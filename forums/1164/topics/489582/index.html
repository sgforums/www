            <div class='col-md body'>Hi, I'm currently waiting enlistment. Just to esquire, is it possible to cope with school and serving at the same time? I am asking this because I want to take a second diploma and then go university (my current GPA CMI). So if i calculate, I would only enter the job market at age 29. So I had this idea of taking modular certs at the polys while serving NS. Then after that can take exemptions. This would mean after I come out of camp I go to night class and then back home. And during my lunch hours or free hours I don't eat but I study. Manageable?</div>

              BMT</span></strong><br> This 9-week programme trains combat-fit recruits in the basic
              military skills to prepare them for advanced vocational training.
              The programme includes weapon training with the SAR 21 rifle which
              will teach recruits technical handling and marksmanship skills; a
              Battle Inoculation Course that simulates a real battlefield; a
              Field Camp which develops basic survival skills; progressive
              training to complete a 24-km route march which builds combat
              fitness and endurance; and hand grenade training.<br> <em><span style="font: inherit;">For those who fail to achieve the
              NAPFA test silver award, they are required to undergo an 8-week

              BMT</span></strong><br> As evidence has shown that obese recruits are able to achieve
              optimum fitness levels and weight loss in about 19 weeks, the new
              BMT programme for recruits with Body Mass Index (BMI) scores
              exceeding 27.0 will be 19 weeks. This BMT programme is designed to
              help obese recruits improve their physical fitness progressively
              while equipping them with basic soldiering skills and
              knowledge.</p>
              <p style="color: #333333; font-size: 14px; line-height: 16px;"><br> <strong><span style="font: inherit;">PES B2

              programme. The new 9-week PES B2 BMT programme will be conducted
              for recruits who are medically fit for deployment in selected
              combat and combat support vocations, such as signal operators,
              combat medics and naval system operators. These recruits will be
              given a new medical classification of PES B2, in place of the
              existing PES C1 classification. This is to ensure that the medical
              classification of our soldiers is consistent with their deployment.
              The new 9-week programme will include customised physical training,
              as well as basic combat training to prepare them for their combat
              and combat support roles.<br>  <br> <strong><span style="font: inherit;">PES C
              BMT</span></strong><br> The 9-week BMT programme will be conducted for PES C recruits. This
              programme will include light physical training and vocational
              training to prepare them for combat service support vocations, such
              as service medic, and those related to logistics and
              administration.<br>  <br> <strong><span style="font: inherit;">PES E
              BMT</span></strong><br> The 4-week BMT programme will be conducted for PES E recruits. This

              <p>Because NS life is different from civilian life before
              enlistment, there are many adjustments you need to make.</p>
              <p>A good way to cope is to get support from your buddy and fellow
              recruits. They are going through the same tough training as you, so
              talking to one another will help relieve some tension.</p>
              <p>In most evenings during your leisure time, you’ll also have some
              time to call your family or loved ones to talk. They can give you
              emotional support during NS.</p>
              <p>You can have a one-on-one interview sessions with your officer
              to highlight any problems you may have. If you have a personal or
              family problem that need to be addressed, do let the officer
              know—he may be able to give you some advice or time off to settle
              your problems.</p>

              within 48 hours of enlistment into full-time NS. Regular interviews
              are subsequently conducted on a monthly basis during the PTP/BMT
              phase. Special interviews are also granted upon request. Servicemen
              can highlight their difficulties during these interviews for

              BMT recruits with adjustment<br> and/or other personal problems.<br> <br> <strong>NS SAF Counselling Hotline</strong> is a 24-hour
              confidential telephone<br> counselling service provided by the SAF Counselling Centre. Manned
              by<br> trained counselling personnel, the SAF Counselling Hotline offers a
              crisis<br> and telephone counselling service to all servicemen. Callers

              <p><em><strong>Being psychologically prepared is all about knowing
              what to expect and being prepared for it.</strong></em></p>
              <p>To be better prepared, you can participate in Total Defence
              activities and Open Houses organised by the SAF/SPF/SCDF.</p>
              <p>Perhaps you should also talk to your family members and friends
              who have lived the NS experience. The more you discuss with others,
              the more comfortable and mentally prepared you’ll become.</p>
              <p><strong>Because NS life is different from civilian life before

              your problems.</p>
              <p>Life in NS revolves around structure, routine and discipline.
              This helps us stay united as a uniformed organisation as well as
              imparts the rigours necessary to protect our nation and
              citizens.</p>
              <p>This does not mean there is just work and no play. In fact,
              after a few weeks in NS and you’ll find new friends and new reasons
              to smile!</p>
              <p><strong>As a soldier, one of the biggest adjustments you’ll have
              to make quickly is in regimentation and discipline.</strong></p>
              <p>Being in a uniformed organisation, you’ll have to obey orders
              from your superiors. Thus some of you may feel a sudden lack of
              freedom to do what you want and you may find yourself having
              difficulties accepting authority initially.</p>
              <p>Regimentation and discipline build strong character and
              toughness, so that you’ll be tough enough to handle difficult
              combat, crime-fighting or rescue situations without giving up or
              breaking down.</p>
              <p>When you first enlist into NS, you may have concerns of being in
              a new territory, with new faces and new things to do. But don’t let
              this get to you. Just remember the saying that “when the going gets
              tough, the tough gets going”.</p>

              <li>Set realistic expectations</li>
              </ul>
              <p>You can also speak to your friends or family members who have
              been through NS. Ask them to share their stories. The sharing will
              help you reduce some of your fears, uncertainties and doubts.</p>
              <p><strong>During NS you’ll be living with different
              people.</strong></p>
              <p>Because these people come from different backgrounds, they may
              not think like you do or react to situations like you would.
              Instead of trying to select your type of people, you should cherish
              the diversity. This is a chance for you to learn more about your
              fellow mates and their cultures.</p>
              <p>You’ll find that you have many opportunities to absorb the
              different cultures—during training, eating, chatting or just seeing
              and listening. Take these opportunities and learn from people
              around you, you’ll have a much better appreciation of Singapore’s
              cultural diversity.</p>

              <h2>Helping servicemen serve</h2>
              </div>
              </div>
              <p>Story by Benita Teo</p>
              <p><strong>Serving in the military is certainly no mean feat. And
              when the security of the nation is in one’s hands, mental strength
              is as important as, if not more so than, physical
              fitness.</strong><br> <br> When the going gets tough, it is often helpful to talk it out with
              a trusted family or friend. But, even with the best of intentions,
              not everyone is able to fully comprehend the intricacies of
              military life.<br> <br> To help the servicemen and women of the Singapore Armed Forces
              (SAF) cope with the challenges of their military roles, the
              counsellors of the SAF Counselling Centre (SCC) are always ready to
              lend a listening ear. In fact, the team at SCC provides
              professional counselling services not only to all members of the
              Ministry of Defence (MINDEF) and SAF, but also to their
              families.<br> <br> <strong>Learning to live the military life</strong><br> <br> Unlike civilian counselling centres, the SCC comes under military
              mandate, and its primary purpose is to provide mental health care
              to ensure that servicemen are able to carry out their duties
              efficiently.<br> <br> Of the types of cases the SCC sees, Mrs Marlene Koh, Head of
              Education and Prevention Services, noted that the majority were
              Full-time National Servicemen (NSFs) with adaptation issues. "Not
              everybody is used to dealing with authority. They all came in as
              students who only had to take care of their own studies."<br> <br> She added: "The second, smaller group would be Regulars with career
              or family issues. A third group comprises families and soldiers
              affected by critical incidents that happened around them, for
              instance training incidents or a death in the family."<br> <br> Servicemen in distress may seek help directly with the SCC through
              two channels: face-to-face sessions or the 24-hour SAF Counselling
              Hotline. On top of these, a Family Support Helpline is also
              available for the family members of soldiers deployed overseas who
              are in need of assistance.<br> <br> <strong>Eyes and ears on the ground</strong><br> <br> To help junior and senior commanders to identify and assist men
              under their charge who are at risk of emotional distress, the SCC
              conducts regular workshops. In addition to basic counselling
              skills, stress management and suicide prevention are also taught at
              the workshops.<br> <br> Ms Cheryl Chia, an SCC counsellor with 14 years of experience,
              explained that equipping commanders with these skills is essential
              because "they are the eyes and ears on the ground".<br> <br> Another set of eyes that the SCC relies on to spot at-risk
              servicemen are the paracounsellors - Regulars who volunteer to help
              look after the mental welfare of servicemen at the unit level. To
              be appointed as paracounsellors, they have to go through a five-day
              course organised by the SCC that teaches basic counselling, suicide
              prevention and crisis management skills.<br> <br> Military Expert (ME) 3-3 Sulinder Singh, a Logistics Warrant
              Officer, has been a paracounsellor in his unit, 201 Squadron (SQN),
              since 2010. And being a familiar face in the unit means that
              servicemen know what to expect when they confide in him -
              trustworthiness.<br> <br> "I'm quite approachable, and they know that if they talk to me, it
              will be confidential."<br> <br> <strong>Allaying fears</strong><br> <br> Besides assuaging doubts over client confidentiality, the
              counsellors and paracounsellors also dispelled the stigma of
              seeking help.<br> <br> "(For) those who are in a position of command, it may be a 'face'
              issue," said SCC counsellor Lawrence Yap. "But so far, I've not
              encountered any clients (Regulars) who claimed that attending
              counselling affected their careers."<br> <br> ME3-3 Singh echoed his sentiments: "Is there a stigma attached to
              people in the unit who see paracounsellors? No, not at all. They
              are not mentally ill, we just need to help them find the right way
              to organise their thoughts."<br> <br> <strong>The counsellor is in</strong><br> <br> Help for a distressed soldier often begins with a visit to the
              Medical Officer (MO) with complaints of symptoms of stress. Said Ms
              Chia: "Usually they will say that they are unable to sleep or eat.
              When the MOs probe deeper and realise that the problem goes beyond
              a medical issue, they will refer them to us."<br> <br> At the SCC, the soldier will be assigned a counsellor. Through the
              sessions, counsellor and soldier will work together to identify the
              problems and set goals towards overcoming them. The counsellor will
              also impart skills such as stress or anger management
              techniques.<br> <br> When facing mental turmoil, a soldier may despair and lose his
              sense of self. One approach a counsellor may take is to remind him
              of his capabilities.<br> <br> "Counselling is about instilling a sense of hope," said Mr Yap, who
              specialises in substance and drug addiction counselling. "Everyone
              has it in them to overcome a difficult situation. We just need to
              help them see that they are not as helpless as they think they are,
              and that the situation is not as hopeless as they think it
              is."<br> <br> SCC counsellors also work with psychiatrists and psychologists from
              the Psychological Care Centre (PCC) at the SAF Medical Corps'
              Military Medicine Institute to provide all-round care to the
              soldier. PCC psychiatrists prescribe medication for conditions like
              depression while psychologists run tests to ascertain if a
              behavioural problem is linked to a learning or intellectual
              disability.<br> <br> <strong>Helping others help themselves</strong><br> <br> With the ever-evolving social landscape, counsellors must stay
              up-to-date on new behavioural problems or addictions, such as
              social media addiction.<br> <br> Mrs Koh also pointed out that there are now more cases of
              servicemen suffering anxieties about not performing well or meeting
              expectations, and that many expected others to solve their
              problems.<br> <br> Mr Yap agreed: "To change, clients have to take personal
              responsibility for their actions."<br> <br> Nonetheless, the counsellors take comfort in the knowledge that
              they are changing lives for the better.<br> <br> Mrs Koh remembered a recruit who had attempted suicide after his
              girlfriend of four years ended their relationship and started
              seeing a friend of his behind his back. Mrs Koh helped him
              acknowledge his feelings of hurt and disappointment, and taught him
              constructive ways of managing his anger.<br> <br> The recruit started to improve his relationship with his family and
              make new friends in his unit. Nine months later, he was finally
              able to move on from the break-up.<br> <br> Ms Chia also recounted a recent case: "I had a client who wanted to
              kill himself. But after working with his unit and the psychiatrist,
              just before his ORD (Operationally Ready Date) he said, 'You gave
              me hope. Even though life ahead will be challenging, at least I
              know now that there are people who care, and that there is more to
              life than thinking about hurting myself.'"<br> <br> She added: "He even baked us cupcakes as a 'thank you'. It's the
              little things like these (that let me know I’ve made a
              difference)."</p>

              <p>More can be done to monitor and support national servicemen with
              mental health issues, according to two experts who used to work
              with the Singapore Armed Forces (SAF).</p>
              <p>These include fighting the stigma attached to such illnesses,
              raising awareness about mental health and having more in-camp
              psychiatrists.</p>
              <p>Earlier this week, State Coroner Imran Abdul Hamid delivered his
              findings on the death of Private Ganesh Pillay Magindren, who was
              found at the foot of his Sengkang condominium last July.</p>
              <p>The 23-year-old had been diagnosed with schizophrenia, which
              distorts a person’s thoughts and emotions, causing him to lose
              touch with reality.</p>

              <p>Handling a mentally ill soldier is not easy. They require proper
              attention and a suitable working environment for them to thrive,
              said psychiatrists contacted by The New Paper. For this to happen,
              the Singapore Armed Forces (SAF) has to take ownership of its
              soldiers, Dr Ang Yong Guan said.<br> <br> Dr Ang, who is in private practice, was the head of the
              Psychological Care Centre (PCC) at the Military Medicine Institute
              during his 23 years with the SAF from 1986 to 2003.<br> <br> He said that of his 4,500 patients, there are fewer than 10 cases
              of full-time national servicemen (NSF).<br> <br> "I forward each NSF's case to the SAF. I believe the organisation
              should be responsible for its own soldiers," he said.<br> <br> But he thinks that the majority of these cases do not get picked
              up.<br> <br> "(When I was at PCC) I always made it a point to monitor those
              soldiers who had severe mental illnesses. I would even call their
              private psychiatrists to find out more.<br> <br> "Only if the organisation's leaders are committed to monitoring and
              helping these patients can they be given the right attention and
              help," Dr Ang said.<br> <br> Consultant psychiatrist Ken Ung of Adam Road Medical Centre said
              that when a soldier is found to be mentally ill, steps should be
              taken to ensure he is placed in a suitable working
              environment.<br> <br> Dr Ung, who sees about 30 to 50 cases of NSFs a month, said that
              superiors and colleagues should also understand that problematic
              soldiers may not always be trying to play the system.<br> <br> BE UNDERSTANDING<br> <br> "There are cases where the superiors are very understanding and
              sympathetic towards their condition and always willing to listen to
              them, and (the patients) thrive," he said.<br> <br> But those who had difficult bosses could lead to a downward spiral
              of the soldier's condition, he said.<br> <br> "I've had such patients who became more and more depressed,
              constantly had nightmares. Parents would complain about their
              behaviour and some even had suicidal thoughts," he said.<br> <br> Superiors should give their subordinates the benefit of the doubt,
              said Dr Ung, adding that they should be proactive and take the time
              to find out if their soldiers are all right.<br> <br> "The SAF is a microcosm of society. It's inevitable that you will
              get soldiers who are mentally ill. So you should learn how to
              handle and manage them."<br> <br> The Ministry of Defence (Mindef) said in a statement on Tuesday
              that it will study the State Coroner's findings carefully to
              improve and tighten its procedures to ensure better compliance by
              Singapore Armed Forces units in dealing with soldiers with mental
              problems.<br> <br> This article was published on April 12, 2014 in The New Paper.</p>
