              <blockquote>
              <p>Here are highlights from the Board of Inspection and Survey reports on the cruiser Chosin and destroyer Stout.</p>
              <h3>Chosin</h3>
              <p>Last deployment: April-September 2007</p>
              <p>* AN/SPS-49 and AN/SPY-1B radars severely degraded by multiple issues.</p>
              <p>* 26 percent of the vertical launch system cells had hatch timing problems and were operationally unusable.</p>
              <p>* Two of three fire control directors were 19 years old and beyond their 15-year depot overhaul requirement.</p>
              <p>* Aviation facility had enough discrepancies to preclude safe flight operations. Aviation demonstration scored an UNSAT .58.</p>
              <p>* Ship could not properly connect shore electrical power.</p>
              <p>* Pilot’s ladder was unsafe for use and too short.</p>
              <p>*
              General ship’s lighting was inadequate; “upgrade of lighting fixtures
              would enhance the ability of personnel to operate and maintain the
              ship’s systems.”</p>
              <p>* Secondary rescue boat could not be secured for sea.</p>
              <p>*
              Nine Departure From Spec listings were in excess of 180 days without
              being repaired; one item — shaft plastic coating — dated from April
              2001.</p>
              <p>* All 25 Mk 1 life preservers and all 29 Kapok life preservers failed visual inspection.</p>
              <p>* 46 of 51 Kevlar lifelines failed visual inspection.</p>
              <p>* 95 percent of the external ladders were rigged with the wrong securing pins or had missing handrail safety pins.</p>
              <p>* Communications demonstration scored an UNSAT .57, as did the Environmental Protection demonstration.</p>
              <h3>Stout</h3>
              <p>Last deployment: July-December 2007</p>
              <p>* Aegis AN/SPY-1D power output was reduced by about 75 percent.</p>
              <p>* Two of three Mk 99 missile illuminators were inoperable.</p>
              <p>* Aft vertical launch system magazine unusable due to fuel tank leakage.</p>
              <p>* Close-In Weapon System was inoperable.</p>
              <p>* Neither of two triple torpedo tube mounts could be quickly trained to firing position.</p>
              <p>* The Mk 45 5-inch gun couldn’t fire due to corrosion in the gun cradle.</p>
              <p>* Search-and-rescue swimmer gear would not permit operations in water colder than 60 degrees Fahrenheit.</p>
              <p>*
              An intermittent problem with the Mk 39 Gyro Data Converter, causing
              unreliable data to be fed to the Aegis weapon control system and gun
              fire control system, had been reported in March 2006 but still not
              repaired.</p>
              <p>* Food service was degraded: The ship’s walk-in freezer
              and nine of 13 reach-in reefers had problems; neither single tank
              dishwasher worked, nor did all three waste disposal units. Only one of
              four steam kettles was operating.</p>
              <p>* 26 of 77 watertight closures inspected were not watertight.</p>
              <p>* The ship scored an UNSAT .51 for the anti-air warfare demonstration.</p>
              <p>* Only three gas turbines were in operation, precluding the ability to conduct a full-power demonstration.</p>
              <p>* The flight deck status lighting system was inoperable due to corrosion.</p>
              <p>* The deck demonstration received a .50 score, UNSAT.</p>
              <p>* The aviation demonstration received a score of .59, UNSAT.</p>
              <p><strong>(NEWS)</strong></p>
              <p>Most of the missiles couldn’t be fired, and neither could any of the
                  big guns. The Aegis radars key to the ships’ fighting abilities didn’t
                  work right.</p>
              <p>The flight decks were inoperable.</p>
              <p>Most of the lifesaving gear failed inspection.</p>
              <p>Corrosion was rampant, and lube oil leaked all over.</p>
              <p>The verdict: “unfit for sustained combat operations.”</p>
              <p>Those
                  results turned up by an inspection by the Navy’s Board of Inspection
                  and Survey — commonly known as an InSurv — would be bad enough if they
                  came from one warship.</p>
              <p>But they came from two. In different
                  fleets, in different oceans. Within a week of each other. And each ship
                  represents the Navy’s most sophisticated front-line surface combatants.....</p>

              <p>Is it the fault of the ship commander or the crew that the ship has such a long list of defects that make two vessel of the same Class being downgraded to be ''unfit for combat'' ?</p>
              <p>Various units in the SAF had similar problems during the early days when National Defence was frantically built up in the late 60s, and the problems stretched on into the 70s - all due to budgetary constraints for the SAF stuck with a huge back log of technical issues that simply could not be resolved overnight from the Logistics Department with the limited manpower, resources and budget.</p>
              <p>Most of the funds were used to keep the equipment in the key SAF units to be in tip top conditions - and these included the Armor and Artillery Units, while the Infantry, Engineer and Transport Units were left with the bare minimum to keep the equipment operational.</p>
              <p>With a strong economy that has grown the National Reserves, MINDEF has invested in alot of new equipment, scrapping the old Bedford that were replaced by Mercedes 3-Tonners in the 70s, which were later replaced by MAN 5-Ton units in the 80s.</p>
              <p>In the late 70s and up to the mid-80s, Engineering equipment were upgraded from WW-2 equipment to the latest brand new systems that were available in Europe and the US.</p>
              <p>The Navy also saw the earlier patrol boats inherited from the British and US Navy being replaced by locally built patrol boats in the mid-1970s, and new missile gun boats added in the early 80s, with the Corvettes being added in the late 80s. While the US LSTs from WW-2 were finally scrapped in the mid-90s after more then 50 years of operation.</p>
              <p>The US Economy is not exactly providing the US Military the budget that need to keep their equipment in shape, and with the war expenditures in Iraq and Afghanistan already sapping the US national reserves into bankruptcy - every sector of the US Military has been affected.</p>
              <p>The US Army has seen their men and equipment worn down by the wars with the short period in between rotation and the wars, and the Commanders have also given notice that the long periods at the battle front performing irregular combat duties will require the units to be retrained and re-equipped.</p>
              <p>With a tight defence budget, the US Air Force has been forced to keep their existing platforms operational, while budget for new units have been drastically trimmed that threatens the economic viability of keeping the industrial lines open for the new aircrafts.</p>
              <p>Should we be surprised that the US Navy is also similarly affected ?</p>
              <p>The two warships that have been inspected is probably the tip of the iceberg of the state of affairs in the US Navy that has seen it being in combat stations for prolonged periods.</p>
              <p>It is remarkable that the US Military has not fallen apart completely at the high operational tempo that is imposed on it.</p>
              <p>Can the SAF even keep itself at the same rate and over a stretched period of time as the US Military - despite the US Government operating on borrowed funds that their future generations will have to pay ?</p>

              <p>Hi,</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>When I went to San Diego for holiday a couple of years ago, i had the opportunity to look a the US naval base from the sea... I went for a whale-watching tour and the boat that we are taking have to sail pass the naval base....</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>There are many chips berthed there and the surprising thing is there doesn't appear to have strict security.... and the whole atmosphere is very casual.... if i had a large rock, I can probably throw it and hit a Aegis destroyer.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>So the US do treat their platform casually, I am sure if they really really to get these platform operationally ready, for eg possible blue-water conflict with the PLAN... they will put in the budget and resources to get the platforms ready.</p>
              <p> </p>

              <p>Hi,</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>When I went to San Diego for holiday a couple of years ago, i had the opportunity to look a the US naval base from the sea... I went for a whale-watching tour and the boat that we are taking have to sail pass the naval base....</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>There are many chips berthed there and the surprising thing is there doesn't appear to have strict security.... and the whole atmosphere is very casual.... if i had a large rock, I can probably throw it and hit a Aegis destroyer.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>So the US do treat their platform casually, I am sure if they really really to get these platform operationally ready, for eg possible blue-water conflict with the PLAN... they will put in the budget and resources to get the platforms ready.</p>
              <p> </p>

              <p><br>They are definitely quite relaxed. I feel like asking their quartermaster for a tour the next time another of their ship visits us. They are always happy to give a guided tour within their ship.</p>
