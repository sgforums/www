            <div class='col-md body'>hello. i was wondering which one is a better SSM..<br><br>from what I read so far(correct me if i'm wrong), one of the main differences in these 2 models of ssm is that the harpoon has a pop up maneuver in its terminal stage of flight whereas the exocet does not..<br><br>the RGM-84A harpoon travels at 855km/h if i'm not wrong, which is around mach 0.7, and has a range of around 120km..it has a guidance system and flight profile of sea-skimming cruise with mid-course guidance monitored by radar altimeter, active seeker radar terminal homing, and carries a 221 kg semi-penetrating warhead.<br><br>The MM-40 Exocet has a speed of mach 0.9, and a range of around 65km, its a sea skimmer, guided by an ESD ADAC X-band monopulse active radar, but does not have a pop up maneover, leading to.. i quote "Otherwise, however, Exocets had a very low PK - especially if the target had any kind of advance warnings or even the slightest means of self-defence. In other cases, it is known that several Excoets have flown over ships laying low in the water (due to their load, or others, which had a hold in the middle of the hull) - without exploding! " from http://www.acig.org/phpBB/viewtopic.php?topic=882&amp;forum=5&amp;18<br><br>In the Falkland  war, HMS Sheffield was hit by a single Exocet amidships. The warhead likely did not explode, but the fires could not be stopped even with the aid of other ships. This was probably because of the fact that the Exocet had a solid fuel engine, and contained its own oxidiser, hence the fires on it could not be put out easily.. the harpoon however, utilizes a conventional air breathing engine and hence uses kerosene instead..<br><br>btw has the harpoon ever been used in conflict before?<br><br>also there are the newer Harpoon block 2 and mm40 exocet block 2/3..anyone have the specifications on these?<br><br>wad abt RSN's delta frigates.. are they going to be armed with harpoon block 2? wad abt malaysias next 4 frigates?</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Exocet has a outstanding record of hitting it's target! In 1986 Iran and Iraq war,a exocet fire from a Mirage F-1 of Iraq air force hit a patrolling US frigate with radar on accidentally.The US crew did not detect the missile and 17 sailor die from that incident!

Have a picture taken during Changi Naval Base open hse.. in one of the   naval vessels have a picture of 2 vipers flanking a fokker with Harpoon mounted on starboard side belly. I took a shot of it using mi  hp. Will try to post it up if i can.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Moskit the aircraft carrier killer.<br><br>source: www.globalsecurity.com<br><br>The NATO designation SS-N-22 Â‘SunburnÂ’ is believed to be designated P270 Moskit, the air-breathing variant of the naval missile 3M80 (the designation 3M80 apparently referring to the Mach 3 speed of 1980 weapons). It may have been designed originally to enhance the effectiveness of Missile Cutter Brigades (that is, units of missile-equipped FACs) and Destroyer Brigades hitherto dependent upon the Malachit or SS-N-9 Â‘SirenÂ’. It is used on "Sovremennyy" destroyers (eight missiles on each) and on "Tarantul [Tarantula] III patrol ships (four missiles on each). A high supersonic speed was specified to reduce the targetÂ’s time to deploy self-defense weapons, indeed the weapon was designed specifically to strike ships with the Aegis command and weapon control system and the SM-2 surface-to-air missile.<br><br>The Moskit (3M80) is a ramjet-powered missile with a slim forward body and ovoid nose, and a fatter rear half with four divided air intakes. There are four clipped delta platform wings and four smaller tail surfaces of similar shape organized in cruciform configuration around the fuselage. All the wings and tail surfaces are folded when the missile is in the launcher. Internally the radar seeker is in the nose with the guidance system, batteries and radio altimeter in the remainder of the front compartment, and the 300 kg semi-armor-piercing warhead immediately behind. A fuel tank, presumably with a kerosene-type fuel, occupies the area to the leading edges of the wing and the area almost to the rear edges is occupied by the ramjet. Much of the rear of the missile is occupied by a solid propellant booster through which runs the ramjet nozzle. Actuators are to be found below the tail surfaces.<br><br>Fuselage - body of revolution with the ogival form of nose section and the X-shaped wing arrangement and tail assembly. Wing and tail assembly folding, made from the material OTYA and OTYA-Y, longerons - from VKL -3. Four off-axis inlets and air ducts are located on the housing. Front fairing with the radio-transparent spinner (three-layered fairing from the fiberglass fabric scan -3 on the connecting material K -9-70). Skin and intermediate collection it is made from VT -5, tank compartment - made of the stainless steel, longerons - from VKL -3, fairing - from the fiberglass fabric T -10 on connecting K -9-70. Air ducts of welded construction - from the material OTYA-Y, OTYA.<br><br>The 3M82 "Mosquito" missiles have the fastest flying speed among all antiship missiles in today's world. It reaches Mach 3 at a high altitude and its maximum low-altitude speed is M2.2, triple the speed of the American Harpoon. The missile takes only 2 minutes to cover its full range and manufacturers state that 1-2 missiles could incapacitate a destroyer while 1-5 missiles could sink a 20000 ton merchantman. An extended range missile, 9M80E is now available.<br><br>When slower missiles, like the French Exocet are used, the maximum theoretical response time for the defending ship is 150-120 seconds. This provides time to launch countermeasures and employ jamming before deploying "hard" defense tactics such as launching missiles and using quick-firing artillery. But the 3M82 "Mosquito" missiles are extremely fast and give the defending side a maximum theoretical response time of merely 25-30 seconds, rendering it extremely difficult employ jamming and countermeasures, let alone fire missiles and quick-firing artillery.<br><br>The air-launched version, officially called ASM-MMS and apparently also Kh-4, is intended specially for Su-27K (Su-33) carrier-based fighter aircraft. It was for the first time shown to the CIS leaders in February 1992 in Machulishche and then to the public in August 1992 at the Moscow Air Show in Zhukovskiy. The missile is propelled by a dual (rocket-jet) engine operating by the same principle as the Kh-31 engine. The missile, suspended under the aircraft, has a folding wing. The missile is guided by an autopilot during the initial fight stage, with possible correction by the aircraft pilot, and by active radar during the final flight stage.<br><br></div>

You are forgetting the 70 over planes, both fighters and transports plus the helicopters carried by both the carrier and the other escort ships.</div>

They will still equip their vessels with the Harpoon ASMs for commonality's sake. It would be logistically easier to equip and maintain one standardized type of ASM aboard our ships.</div>
