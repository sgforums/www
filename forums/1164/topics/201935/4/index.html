If they're mucking around the same moral high ground as the Heza, I might as well go throw my lot in with the Heza.<br><br>If they want to claim to be civilized, they better start acting like it, and giving a damn about the lives of the innocent. So what if the Heza doesn't play by the rules of engagement? Does that give the Israelis a right to disregard non-Hezas and gun them down in their attempt to get to the Hezas?<br><br>Like I said, if your kid was a hostage and the police gunned him down because they weren't really giving a damn about whether the hostages survives as much as they were about killing the hostage takers, would u still be able to hold the same view u do now?<br><br>If theres going to be a conflict with 2 bad guys and no good guys, I'd rather support the underdog. And Im sure many people feel that way too, because people often throw their lot in with what they see as the "bullied", and this is no longer the days of the Yom Kipper War, hence u can rest assured that Israeli is now seen as the oppressor.<br><br>U can continue to label the world and everyone who disagrees with as naive, but the truth is, IF Israeli is not smart enough to realise they NEED the moral high ground, then they are the really naive ones, and u're not that far behind.</div>

(Hat tip: Larry.)<br><br>From the UNÂ’s own press releases:<br><br>24 July 2006:<br><br>One unarmed UN military observer, a member of the Observer Group Lebanon (OGL), was seriously wounded by small arms fire in the patrol base in the Marun Al Ras area yesterday afternoon. According to preliminary reports, the fire originated from the Hezbollah side during an exchange with the IDF. He was evacuated by the UN to the Israeli side, from where he was taken by an IDF ambulance helicopter to a hospital in Haifa. He was operated on, and his condition is now reported as stable.<br><br>Notice: in this instance, the UN observer was injured badly enough to be evacuated to an Israeli hospital. Where they saved his life.<br><br>Not a word of condemnation from Kofi Annan for Hizballah. And not a word of gratitude for Israel, for saving a UN peacekeeperÂ’s life.<br><br>25 July 2006:<br><br>This morning, Hezbollah opened small arms fire at a UNIFIL convoy consisting of two armored personnel carriers (APC) on the road between Kunin and Bint Jubayl. There was some damage to the APCs, but no casualties, and the convoy was obliged to return to Kunin.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Lebanon: UN observer teams in line of fire in south to relocate<br><br><a href="http://www.un.org/apps/news/story.asp?NewsID=19332&amp;Cr=leban&amp;Cr1=" rel="nofollow">http://www.un.org/apps/news/story.asp?NewsID=19332&amp;Cr=leban&amp;Cr1=</a><br><br><blockquote>28 July 2006 Â– Three days after a United Nations post in Lebanon was destroyed during an Israeli bombardment, leaving four dead, the UN Interim Force in Lebanon (UNIFIL) has decided to temporarily move unarmed observers into more secure positions.<br><br>The decision was made to move members of the Observer Group Lebanon (OGL) from patrol bases in the Marwahin and Markaba area into more secure UNIFIL positions as the mission reports increasingly intense exchanges of fire along the Blue Line of withdrawal between Israel and Lebanon. <span style="color: red;">There were two direct hits on its bases in the past 24 hours from the Israeli side, and Hezbollah fired from the vicinity of five of its positions.</span><br><br>Beside the fatal attack on the patrol base at Khiyam, a military observer was seriously wounded by Hezbollah small arms fire on Sunday, and Assistant Secretary-General for Peacekeeping Operations Jane Holl Lute told the Security Council on Wednesday that observers may need to be consolidated to minimize further risk.</blockquote>i am sure that the hizbollah has very serious significant concern and considerations when they decided to fire so close to the UN position at isreali civilians.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Whoever wins, the noncombatants lose.<br><br>And I doubt this is exactly a land grab for the sake of it, or an excuse for an outing to expand their borders. It's more trouble and blood then it's worth and frankly I think everybody is quite tired of this settlement stuff. Maybe if Israeli civillians started settling there I might buy it, but right now it seems that this occupation is being done for military reasons. Which is an expected reaction from them actually...<br><br>Anyway I doubt clearer heads can be easily found in Isreal... it's easy to talk about the dangers of facism and the like when you are not being attacked by sucide bombers and surrounded by nations that don't exactly like having you around. But throw that all in one might see how people might be supportive of oppressive measures and responses... would you not be in their position as well?<br><br>And the Bolla guys aren't exactly heros either, given the fact they have taken great pains to make sure civillians were in the line of any return fire when they carry out their activities. Frankly I can't comprehend that kind of behaviour beyond the fact they simply don't care about nocombatants or are using them as pawns for their cause.</div>
