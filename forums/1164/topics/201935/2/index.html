Lewis MacKenzie yesterday.<br><br>The strike hit the UN observation post in the southern Lebanese village of El Khiam, killing Canadian Maj. Paeta Hess-von Kruedener and three others serving as unarmed UN military observers in the area.<br><br>Just last week, Maj. Hess-von Kruedener wrote an e-mail about his experiences after nine months in the area, words Maj.-Gen. MacKenzie said are an obvious allusion to Hezbollah tactics.<br><br>"What I can tell you is this," he wrote in an e-mail to CTV dated July 18. "We have on a daily basis had numerous occasions where our position has come under direct or indirect fire from both (Israeli) artillery and aerial bombing.<br><br>"The closest artillery has landed within 2 meters (sic) of our position and the closest 1000 lb aerial bomb has landed 100 meters (sic) from our patrol base. This has not been deliberate targeting, but rather due to tactical necessity."<br><br>Those words, particularly the last sentence, are not-so-veiled language indicating Israeli strikes were aimed at Hezbollah targets near the post, said Maj.-Gen. MacKenzie.<br><br>"What that means is, in plain English, 'We've got Hezbollah fighters running around in our positions, taking our positions here and then using us for shields and then engaging the (Israeli Defence Forces)," he said.<br><br>That would mean Hezbollah was purposely setting up near the UN post, he added. It's a tactic Maj.-Gen. MacKenzie, who was the first UN commander in Sarajevo during the Bosnia civil war, said he's seen in past international missions: Aside from UN posts, fighters would set up near hospitals, mosques and orphanages.<br><br>(for the rest of the article, click here =&gt; <a href="http://www.canada.com/ottawacitizen/news/story.html?id=37278180-a261-421d-84a9-7f94d5fc6d50" rel="nofollow">Canada.com</a>)</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>ItÂ’s not odd that defendant will counter accuse the victim wrong doings so as to justify his action. But one hard factor  they can hardly deny is the dirty job is delivered via a precisely guided bomb which hardly  has a CEP over 10 meters. Did the militia entered the UN post to launch their rocket so the Israeli can pinpoint this 2 Â–storey  small house for brutal attack? Probably we wouldnÂ’t have the direct answer anymore because the dead men will never talk.<br><br>As I said, itÂ’s Ice age, never expect a fully authorized and independent Jury to access the truth , no judge will be more powerful than the bally behind the tiny Jewish state who provides the precision weapon and fuel and finance. HavenÂ’t we  seen the UN chief already soften his tone. ThereÂ’re no direct wrong or right in this muddy politics, only the compromise, those with bigger jaw and muscles will win more points. Our voice is weak next to silent in the stage and  one day the killing is done, the other day there will be other professionals to do the scene clean and story writing. So they can dress up the Â“Law 7 orderÂ” the next morning with fresh. What a wonderful day.<br><br>However, thereÂ’s always a place we call heart, we know the truth will be in every oneÂ’s soul. ThereÂ’re ppl believe 6 hrs shelling and finally a precision guided missile can be Â“unintentional Â“, but I guess most of those wonÂ’t be the same, provided they know how accurate should those guided missiles are. Or in another word, itÂ’s Â“pinpointedÂ”<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Interestingly the Ottawa Citizen article quoted by the Bear said, in it's last paragraph on Page 2<br><br><blockquote><strong>If indeed Israel was attempting to hit Hezbollah fighters in the area, it hasn't yet used the excuse to explain its actions because it wouldn't make it any less guilty in the world's eyes, Capt. Forsberg said.</strong></blockquote>Even if your enemy are barbarians, theres no reason that, as a supposedly "civilized" state acting in "self-defence", you have to sink to that level. Just like targeting all ambulances in sight just because your enemy is low enough to use ambulances to transport arms. Just because the enemy does not respect the Red Cross, does not give you the excuse to do the same, especially when you're claiming the moral high ground<br><br><a href="http://www.news.com.au/heraldsun/story/0,21985,19918297-5005961,00.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.news.com.au/heraldsun/story/0,21985,19918297-5005961,00.html</a></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>heart and all that is fine, when you are not the target of katyusha rockets.. but that being said, the lebanese are the business end of precision bombs...<br><br>i have a theory which is so sad, it almost brings me to tears if it was true.. hear me out...<br><br>the Israelis have been taking the flak for everything.. the animosity, the hatred, the vilification... because if they had spoken the truth, no one would believe them and the anger against Israel would be amplified..<br><br>notice they took the flak and kept silent about the Al-Durah incident?<br>notice they are taking the flak for the UN post being blasted?<br>notice they keep silent about a lot of things?<br><br>could it be that the truth is so heinous, even if the evidence exonerated the Israelis, no one would believe the evidence anyway and will accuse Israel of lying?<br><br>take the Al-Durah incident.. newsbites and the news insisted that the IDF shot and killed the Palestinian father and son hiding behind a concrete barrel... there was worldwide condemnation of Israel.. and they kept quiet.. and ultimately, the incident blew over..<br><br>when independent analysis of the whole situation was made, the truth was that the Israelis could not have shot the father and son.. they were not in the position to do so as they were on the other side of the wall.. the wall shielded the father and son from the IDF.. yet they were killed... the only people who could have killed them were the cameramen or THE PALESTINIAN FIGHTERS themselves!<br><br>the cameramen who filmed the deaths of the pair were rock-steady.. which meant they were not under fire... yet, they would have been "in the line of fire" from the IDF in order to film the situation..<br><br>now, would any audience in the world believe such atrocity carried out by their own people, just for a newsbite?  if the Israelis were to insist on the truth, would the world believe them?  and when they would not believe them, won't the hatred and animosity be increased?<br><br>well, that's the Al-Durah incident... now let's come to this current incident...<br><br>if the Canadian UN soldier's email is true (he has no reason to lie), then look at the fallout.. in a political point of view...<br><br>if the Israelis were to push this point, that the Hezbollah was constantly using the UN post as a staging aread, a point to engage the IDF, the implications would be staggering:  the UN KNOWS that Hezbollah was targetting Israel with rockets, and did NOTHING about it even when they used the UN post to fire their rockets!<br><br>this would mean that the UN is impotent, and that their presence there is totally useless, they did not report any of these crimes to anyone, and that they have failed in every way...<br><br>you think for one moment those who make up the UN would let Israel make that accusation and allow it to stick? even if it was true? that implicates all of them in a crime against a sovereign country! it would be political suicide for Israel to go against the UN..<br><br>so... Israel has to keep quiet, accept the false accusations against them.. and try to stay alive in a region where the obsession of every country around them is the destruction of Israel...<br><br>now, isn't that tragic?</div>

Can they indeed release the full truth?<br><br>As I said, the key factor is the precision-guided missile that took all the lives of the UN peacekeepers NOT the stray artillery fire, which means the one carrying the killing with clear mind who going to die inside. the UN bunk built there shows UN already do  not want to involve in this battle so both sides can engage each other by artillery fire free hand, however, whatÂ’s naked fact is the killing is NOT carried by the side supposed to be Â“ terroristÂ”<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>im just glad to see so many agree that if we can bring the number of unnecessary dead high enough, one israeli soldier's life becomes a statistic instead of a tragedy, then we can all feel a bit less misty-eyed about him.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br>The future is bright.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br>If the police forces of the world adopted the Israeli's tactics, they'd shoot innocent hostages 1st during hostage crisis just so the baddies have no one else to use as a shield. I find the justification of shelling the UN post just because the hezas were using it as a shield totally ridiculous. Its not about pragmatism or practicality. Its about how human u are. All this talk about "civilized" people not wanting to leave one of their own behind, and these civilized people don't even have qualms about shooting "hostages". Civilized MY ASS.</div>

I'm saying its WRONG of the Israelis to have done what they did.<br><br>Its only asymmetrical to someone who wishes to see it as asymmetrical. I look back thru the posts, and nobody's said the Heza are right. Anyone critical of the Israelis are being so because they didn't give a damn about the human shields, which puts them on the same level of disregard for human lives as the heza. And please, its easy to drop leaflets to tell people to move. Dropping leaflets and then shelling an area u know damn well is still chock full of innocents doesn't make them have any more regards for innocent lives. If thats a way of assuaging their conscience, its a damn convenient and cheap way of doing it.<br><br>This whole discussion is about what the Israelis did, so lets keep it on that, and save the debate on what whether the Hezas are right or not for another thread.

            <div class='col-md body'>2 questions Bear:<br><br>- Were there rockets being fired from near the UN post *at the time*? No one knows, but judging from they way the area was being shelled for the past few hours before the bomb hits, I say unlikely<br><br>- Even if there was, how far were they launch positions from the UN post? Was it reasonable to expect that the distance between the UN post and the launch position was so close that a laser-guided bomb will score a direct hit on the post when it missed the target? Again, I'd say unlikely<br><br>As for Israel keeping quiet, I'm sorry but what planet have you been on? Look at how the Lobby influences the media, such that even some Americans are complaining that the Israeli press is more critical of Israel than the American press. Go watch the Google video link posted earlier, and come tell us again if Israel suffers in silence when "wrongly accused".<br><br>And yes, as a soldier, you remain at your post till you're told otherwise. Anything else is cowardice, like the German policemen who used "democracy" as a (bad) excuse for cowardice inside the Boeing 727 during the bungled rescue of the Israeli athletes during the Munich Olympics massacre.<br><br>The day states stoop to the level of terrorists and criminals, supposedly to fight them, humankind is in trouble.</div>
