There are unconfirmed reports a Canadian is among the dead.<br>A bomb directly hit the building of the observer force in the town of Khiyam near the eastern end of the border with Israel, said Milos Struger, spokesman for the UN peacekeeping force in Lebanon known as UNIFIL.<br>Struger said UNIFIL had dispatched a rescue team which was trying to clear the rubble when it came under more fire from Israeli forces.<br>A senior Lebanese military official said the dead included observers from Canada, Austria, China and Finland.<br>However, the Department of National Defence has not confirmed the report. The federal government would only say there's been a significant incident involving a Canadian UN observer.<br>One Canadian soldier, with the Princess Patricia's Canadian Light Infantry,  is currently serving with the UN at the base in Khiyam as part of  a mission called Operation Jade.<br>Annan reacts strongly<br>"I am shocked and deeply distressed by the apparently deliberate targeting by Israeli Defence Forces of a UN Observer post in southern Lebanon that has killed two UN military observers, with two more feared dead," said UN Secretary-General Kofi Annan, after rushing out of a meeting with U.S. Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice and Lebanese Prime Minister Fuad Saniora.<br><br>"This coordinated artillery and aerial attack on a long established and clearly marked UN post at Khiyam occurred despite personal assurances given to me by Prime Minister Ehud Olmert that UN positions would be spared Israeli fire."<br>But, Israel's ambassador to the UN denied his country would deliberately target a UN post.<br>"I am shocked and deeply distressed by the hasty statement of the secretary-general, insinuating that Israel has deliberately targeted the U.N. post," said Dan Gillerman.<br>Gillerman said Israel would investigate: "We do not have yet information what caused this death: it could be the IDF (Israel's military), it could be Hezbollah."<br>Charles Kupchan, a senior fellow with the Council on Foreign Relations, said he was surprised by Annan's comments.<br>"Israelis have generally gone out of their way to avoid civilian targets," he told CTV Newsnet.  "So why Annan would come out with a statement like that is, I think, quite surprising."<br>Kupchan said it was too early to speculate on how or why the post was bombed, but said that in some cases UN and Hezbollah camps are right next door to each other.<br>But, Sunil Ram, a defence and security analyst, told CTV Newsnet that the Israelis had shelled the base at least 14 times before bombing it with what was clearly a guided bomb.<br>Iran warns of broader battles<br>DUSHANBE, Tajikistan -- Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad warned Tuesday that the conflict between Lebanon and Israel could trigger "a hurricane" of broader fighting in the Middle East.<br><br>Ahmadinejad's country is a major backer of the Hezbollah militant group and a sworn enemy of Israel. In his comments, he referred to a proverb that says: "He who raises the wind will get a hurricane."<br><br>"That proverb fully relates to the Middle East, which is a very volatile region," he said. "And it will be a strong hurricane which will strike really hard."<br>--Associated Press<br>"UN posts like this are very well marked. The Israelis knew it was there; it's been there for years.<br>"But then when the Indians tried to send a rescue mission in there, they then shelled the troops who were trying to get to the post. So how much more deliberate do you want it to be?"<br>On Monday, vans marked with Red Crosses had come under fire.<br>Beirut struck again<br>Tuesday's bombing came as Israeli forces pushed deeper into southern Lebanon, part of a campaign to stop Hezbollah missiles.<br>Israel also pounded Beirut with new air strikes, marking the first attacks in Lebanon's capital in almost two days.<br>At least four large blasts were heard as a heavy gray cloud was seen billowing from the southern district -- a Hezbollah stronghold that has been heavily bombarded.<br>Al-Jazeera TV reported 20 Israeli rockets hit the Dahiyah neighborhood as a succession of blasts set off car alarms in central Beirut and sirens were heard.<br>In return, Hezbollah rained rockets down on the northern Israeli city of Haifa, injuring at least five people.<br>Hezbollah's leader, Sheik Hassan Nasrallah, issued a taped television message saying guerrillas would now start firing rockets deeper into Israel, beyond the northern port city of Haifa<br><br></blockquote></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Actually I find it's strange the guys who started it all think that Israel would react in any other way, and stranger still that they could have done a lot to stop it all from happening, but did nothing to do so.<br><br>Apparently they think nothing of trading their own people's blood to make their point. And I believe given the chance they would do the very same thing to Israel without a pause. Now it's just a question of who has the bigger guns.<br><br>The issue is not as simple as you think, it's the innocents that are suffering to make a point on both sides. One side to show that they will not be bowed by such attacks across their border, and the other side who don't care a whilt about friendly noncombatants by hiding their munitions (to kill other noncombatants with) within their very houses.<br><br>Nobody is clear of blood in this bloody game of tit-for-tat.</div>

Don't the isreal have the rights to protect themselves?<br><br>How come no body says anything when the russian mafia leader Putins order his elite to deal with those who kill his russian in iraq?<br><br>How come no one dare to says anything when USA destroy an entire regime in afaganistan after 911?<br><br>Isreal just do exactly what anyone else would do to protect himself and destroy his thread. Do you know how many people are killed by terrorist each year? Innocent civilians in Isreal targeted by suicide bombers. I agree with most people here. The terriorist should just stop being an arse stop showering fire on Isreal civilians and release of the soldier. Or they simply deserve this!  If I am the government I do exactly the same time. That's why military is for. the interest of the people.<br><br>But on second tot if Singapore were to face the same thing. Showered with fire from neighbours and capturing our people. Do you not think we will not react too?<br><br>Finally if you still don't know how this world work out I tell you. Morality is spoken only in times of peace and bordom. In every nation's top number priorities is SURVIVAL. Do you think Singapore is peaceful and wasn't being bullied because our neighbour is moral!?

The deployment marked the first time China had sent peacekeepers to the Middle East, state media reported earlier this year.<br><br>"I'm very sad," said Chinese Foreign Minister Li Zhaoxing, in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, where he was attending a regional conference.<br><br>"We should try harder to call on the parties to be restrained and to be calm and restore the peace process of the Middle East immediately," Li said.<br><br>The Chinese Foreign Ministry statement said Israel's ambassador to Beijing was summoned Wednesday morning and asked to convey Beijing's request that Israel fully investigate the incident and issue an apology to China and the victims' families.<br><br>The statement also called on Israel to ensure the safety of U.N. peacekeepers in Lebanon.<br><br>Nadav Eshcar, the political and press officer with the Israeli Embassy in Beijing, said that during the meeting, Ambassador Yehoyada Haim "expressed profound regret" for the deaths and assured Chinese officials that the incident was being investigated.<br><br>"Israel does not target U.N. personnel," Eshcar said. "In this kind of situation many things can happen, some very unfortunate."<br><br>Du's mission was tasked with land mine clearing, the construction of roads, buildings, parking lots and defense facilities and providing humanitarian assistance, the official People's Liberation Army Daily newspaper said in April.<br><br>It was not the first time a Chinese military peacekeeper had died while on duty.<br><br>Zhang Li, deputy director of the Peacekeeping Affairs Office of the Defense Ministry, was quoted by the PLA Daily last year as saying that six Chinese servicemen had lost their lives in U.N. peacekeeping operations since 1990.<br><br>More than 4,000 peacekeeping troops, military observers and engineering personnel have taken part in 14 U.N. peacekeeping activities between 1990 and 2005, Zhang was quoted as saying.<br><br></blockquote></div>

Interim Force in Lebanon (UNIFIL) base in Noqoura said.</strong><br><br><strong>Finally, an Israeli bomb exploded directly on the U.N. post near Khiyam</strong>, killing four U.N. observers from Austria, Finland, Canada and China, the U.N. officer said.<br><br>As of Wednesday morning, three of the four bodies had been recovered from the rubble, an officer at the UNIFIL base in Noqoura said.<br><br>Israeli Foreign Ministry spokesman Mark Regev said the incident would be "thoroughly investigated" and that the Israeli military had taken measures since the start of its bombardment of southern Lebanon to protect the U.N. observers there.<br><br>"Israel would never deliberately target U.N. personnel," Mark Regev said.<br><br>According to Regev, Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert called U.N.Secretary-General Kofi Annan and "expressed his regret at this tragedy in Lebanon."<br><br>Annan issued a sharply worded statement Tuesday evening which said he was "shocked and deeply distressed by the apparently deliberate targeting ... of a U.N. observer post in southern Lebanon." He called on Israel to conduct "a full investigation into this very disturbing incident."<br><br>"This coordinated artillery and aerial attack on a long established and clearly marked U.N. post at Khiyam occurred despite personal assurances given to me by Prime Minister Ehud Olmert that U.N. positions would be spared Israeli fire," Annan said.<br><br>"Furthermore, General Alain Pelligrini, the U.N. force commander in south Lebanon, had been in repeated contact with Israeli officers throughout the day on Tuesday, stressing the need to protect that particular U.N. position from attack."<br><br>The timeline provided CNN by a U.N. officer in Lebanon showed the first bomb exploded about 200 yards from the U.N. outpost at 1:20 p.m. Tuesday, prompting the first call by the UNIFIL observers to their designated contact with the Israeli military. The officer said they were assured by the Israeli liaison that he would stop the attacks.<br><br>A series of about nine more bombs hit within 100 to 400 yards from the observers over the next several hours, with a call to the Israeli military following each explosion.<br><br>The U.N. base at Noqoura lost contact with the outpost at 7:40 p.m., apparently the time of the direct hit, the officer said.<br><br>China issued a strong condemnation of the Israeli airstrike, according to a statement posted on the Chinese Foreign Ministry Web site Wednesday.<br><br>"China urges the concerned sides, especially Israel, to take tangible measures to ensure the security of UN peacekeepers," said Foreign Ministry spokesman Liu Jianchao.<br><br>China's state-run news agency -- Xinhau -- said Chinese Assistant Foreign Minister Zhai Jun called in Israeli Ambassador Yehoyada Haim Wednesday morning to discuss the attack.<br><br>"China strongly condemns the activity to raid the UN peacekeeping post and urge Israel to carry out thorough investigation and apologize to China and the victim's families and coordinate with China to deal with the aftermath," Xinhau quoted Zhao as telling the Israeli ambassador.<br><br>Xinhua said the Chinese observer killed was Du Zhaoyu.</blockquote><a href="http://edition.cnn.com/2006/WORLD/meast/07/26/mideast.observers/" rel="nofollow">http://edition.cnn.com/2006/WORLD/meast/07/26/mideast.observers/</a><br><br>Anan is turning into an puppet... to think that he would say that it was an accident today .. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_evil.gif" alt="Evil or Very Mad" title="Evil or Very Mad"><br><br>The post was hit by an air dropped PGM !!!
