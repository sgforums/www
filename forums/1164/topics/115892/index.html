It is air-cooled and its 21.4-inch barrel is designed for quick-change by the gun crew. In the ground version, i. weighs 231/2 pounds with an overall length of 49.2 inches. Its adjustable gas regulator permits the cyclic rate to be varied from 650 to 1,100 rpm.<br><br><blockquote>(Pity my MG team) I personally like to place my MG next to me whenever an assault or charge up is to be carry out. I will never never place them as a close fire support group. It a waste of fire power.<br><br>As for close fire support, I just need group 2 or 3, SS/LAW with SAW or M203 with SAW, they will do a great job.</blockquote></div>
