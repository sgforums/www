              <p id="articlecontent"><span>SINGAPORE: Singapore will be joining the international community with its anti-piracy efforts in the Gulf of Aden. <br><br>Defence Minister Teo Chee Hean told Parliament on Thursday that Singapore will be deploying a Landing Ship Tank, with two Super Puma helicopters for a period of three months this year. <br><br>The ship will work with the newly-formed multi-national Combined Task Force 151 to protect shipping in the Gulf of Aden. <br><br>The LST will be deployed once the operational arrangements have been made. <br><br>Minister Teo explained that Singapore's involvement is because as a maritime nation, the country shares the concerns of the international community regarding piracy. <br><br>It is also committed to supporting international efforts to keep the sea lanes safe and secure. <br><br>He stressed that it is not possible for any country, including Singapore, to protect its own shipping in all the key sea lanes of the world. <br><br>Hence all countries have to depend on international cooperation to secure the sea lanes for everyone's use and that means littoral states, user states, and the international community have a role to play. <br><br>Minister Teo said there was an upsurge of piracy attacks recently in the Gulf of Aden. <br><br>In the past year, over 100 ships have been attacked by pirates, who have raked in an estimated ransom of US$120 million. <br><br>And in recent months, NATO, the European Union, the US, as well as countries such as China, India, Malaysia and Russia, have contributed to anti-piracy efforts in the Gulf of Aden. <br><br>Other countries, including Japan and Turkey, have announced their intention to send naval vessels. <br><br><br>- CNA/ir</span></p>

              <p>The frigates and their crews are still running in, and probably have not reached the desire level of operational readiness.</p>
              <p>At the same time, the Sikorsky helicopters that have been ordered for the frigates are still in the assembly lines, while the air crew are still being trained in the US.</p>
              <p>If the frigate is to be deployed, the Singapore Navy will need to consider having some logistic supply ships to support our vessels sent out on long distance service, and provide replenishments without letting our assets to be exposed to any onshore threats.</p>
              <p>The LST remains the best option and will be able to carry sufficient fuel and supplies in the huge 'warehouse' space inside its hull that do not carry any other troops or equipment while in transit or on patrol.</p>

              <p>With the anti-piracy patrols being conducted in a high risk area, the RSN having experience in deploying the earlier types of Protector USV, may probably get to deploy the more versatile Spartan Scout USV - which was designed for such a mission.</p>

              <p>"The USVs allows ships to deploy such a vessel without getting the men into too close contact with a suspicious boat, which may have undesirable intentions," Teo told reporters after the demonstration.</p>

              <p>Singapore is developing the Spartan in conjunction with the US Navy and expects to begin testing the vessels in local waters this year, the defence ministry said.</p>
              <p>A less-equipped USV fleet that Singapore bought, the Protector series, is already in operation and was recently deployed by the Singapore navy during a deployment near Iraq to help US-led forces, according to the defence ministry.</p>
              <p>Both fleets were presented to the media on the first day of Imdex Asia 2005, a regional maritime conference showcasing the latest maritime defence technologies and products of 23 countries.</p>
              <p>Speaking earlier at the conference's opening ceremony, Teo, referring to the USVs as an example, said regional navies should engage in technological collaboration to combat pirates and potential terrorists lurking in the region's waters.</p>

              <p>"In particular, unmanned surface vehicles can offer safer and more effective responses to maritime threats."</p>
              <p>Teo did not say how much the USVs cost nor exactly how many Protectors the Singapore navy had, describing the fleet only as "small". No details were given on how far the USVs can operate from the main warship.</p>

              <p>Do u think MINDEF would send LST to war zone without AA?</p>

              2005. RSS Endeavour (L 210) operated in the Persian Gulf from February

              <p>Hello 'noisy-pussy' - did you misread the name of this thread ?</p>
              <p>Are you sure you got your compass bearing right ?</p>
              <p>This is not the Persian Gulf, where the threats of aerial attack will most likely come from Iranian air assets trying to make a "monkey" out of our tiny RSN asset - as they had done with the Royal Navy - for supporting the US Government policy in Iraq.</p>
              <p>This is a new mission for the RSN in deploying the LST to the Gulf of Aden, where the rogue Somalis are committing piracy on international shipping.</p>
              <p>Whether the Somalis are armed with any kind of aerial light craft - in the same fashion as the Tamil Tigers in Sri Lanka - the Mistral man-handled AA equipment is a standard piece on the LST.</p>
              <p><em>Did anyone suggest that the AA pieces will be taken out</em> ?</p>
              <p>Is there any urgency for the Endurance Class LST to install the <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.defenseindustrydaily.com/images/ORD_SAM_Barak_Launch_lg.jpg">Barak Anti-Aircraft Missile </a>when these were not installed during the mission in the Persian Gulf ?</p>
              <p>The biggest threat to all the naval assets - that have been deployed on anti-piracy patrols - will be the Somalis doing a repeat of the Al Qaeda attack on USS Coles.</p>
              <p>In the attack on the USS Coles, it was reported that a typical small size native type speed boat was used, and loaded full of C-4 explosives to get alongside the larger USN vessel that was unaware of the suicide plot that was about to hatch.</p>
              <p>The result of the attack from that small native craft against the USS Coles can be seen in the following photos:</p>

              <p>Damage to the Port Side of USS Coles - alongside the engine room</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>We certainly do not wish to see our RSN LST to be ferried back in similar condition.</p>
              <p>The Spartan Scout has been designed to carry up to 7 tons of equipment - which will include "explosive sniffing" equipment to scan every innocuous looking vessels that attempt to come near the LST.</p>
              <p>Our LST should remain in good fighting condition as the USS Coles was intended to be - prior to the dastardly attack that cost 17 lives and 39 injured on that fateful day, when the USS Coles refuelled at the Port of Aden on 12 October 2000.</p>

              <p><br>The NDU maybe known as the Naval Diving Unit but for all intent and purpose its roles and missions are not restricted as a "Diving Unit" <em>per se.</em></p>
              <p>The NDU would be similar to the Naval <em>Special Forces</em> of other more establised Armed Forces that we try to emulate - such as the US Delta Force and SEALS, and the UK SAS and Special Boat Unit - <em><span style="text-decoration: underline;">which our NDU regularly trained with</span></em>. See reference piece below: </p>
              <p><a rel="nofollow" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naval_Diving_Unit_(Singapore)">NDU divers are also regularly sent overseas for training, in particular, with the US Army Special Forces (Green Berets), US Navy SEALs and the British Special Air Service. In 2001, naval officer Captain Wong Foo Chan became the first foreigner to top his class in the Green Berets course, and received a commendation medal for this achievement. He had also completed the Navy SEAL course in 1999.. </a></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>In a special military blog that featured - <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.militaryspot.com/specialforces.htm">Special Forces Channel. </a>- it had interestingly mentioned Singapore as having the following Special Forces:</p>
              <p><strong>Army:</strong></p>
              <p>Singapore Commandos</p>
              <p>Singapore Special Operations Force (SOF)</p>
              <p><strong></strong></p>
              <p><strong>Navy :</strong></p>
              <p>Naval Diving Unit (NDU)</p>
              <p><strong></strong></p>
              <p><strong>Law Enforcement:</strong></p>
              <p>Special Opeations Command - Special Tactics and Rescue (STAR)</p>
              <p>Police Coast Guard - Special Task Squadron (STS)</p>
              <p>Singapore Prison Service - Singapore Prison Emergency Reaction Response (SPEAR) Force</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>In anticipation of terrorists attacks on civilian shipping in our Singapore waters, NDU had trained in 2005 to board ships from various means: see below:</p>

              <p>i have not read significant fire fight between the somalia pirates with international navies patrol. If it is just regular pirates there are no suicide attack after all they are in for the money not killing.</p>
              <p>If there are suicide attack reported than there are terrorist elements mixed with Pirates.</p>
              <p>But it is a Pirates Hot Zone. So certainly prepared for action.....could these be RSN first blood?</p>

              <p>the only way an light vessel can attack a warship is either the attacker is super lucky or</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>a. the ROE is so constrained that the defending warship did not react until it is too late</p>
              <p>b. the defending warship is not alert of the threat</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>for b., it is a no brainer, the warships are clear what the threats are</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>as for a., there is a UN mandate to rid the area of pirates, there is no fear of any 'esclation' also, if there is a unidentified 'speedboat' that is heading towards any warship, just blow it out of the water.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>the 76mm Oto Melera gun is more then sufficient for that task, if not there are close in weapons like the 25mm/30mm Remote controlled gun... (can't remember the name).</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I think the LST is ample for the task, in fact, any warship with a weapon like the 76mm gun is more then sufficient to defend itself.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Any terrorist or pirates will not be so 'stupid', if they don't have the element of surprise, they know that they will have no way of making any impact at all, sucide mission and all...</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>just imagine the scenario in Mumbai, if the Indian special forces are waiting for them at the pier, the terrorist will not be able to take 3 steps on land before they are all shot dead.</p>

              <p>Do u think MINDEF would send LST to war zone without AA?</p>
              <p>I dunt think so.The Gulf has not been a safe place.</p>
              <p>So,i think AA stuff alreday on board LST.</p>

RSS Resolution (L 208) operated in the Persian Gulf from November 2004 until January 2005. RSS Endeavour (L 210) operated in the Persian Gulf from February 2006 until April 2006. RSS Persistence (L 209) deployed last September to contribute to Task Force 58.<br><br>Once again, we see an amphibious ship used in a role other than for amphibious assault, more evidence of the flexibility of the platform.

              <p><br>US Intelligence is concerned that Al Qaeda has already inflitrated their people into this lawless stretch of land that has a wide coastal front, and at the mouth of the Gulf of Aden that leads to the Suez Canal in the north.</p>
              <p>The US had problems with the Somalis before - in a UN sanctioned operation - that was made famous in the movie "Black Hawk Down".</p>
              <p>The pirates may not want to confront the growing fleet of naval vessels in this UN sanctioned international effort to stop piracy, but Al Qaeda may sneek into this area, and disguise themselves as pirates to blow up either a naval vessel, or a hijacked vessel, or both.</p>
              <p>The attempt to blow up a naval vessel can be made by disguising themselves as a "hijacked vessel" and coming alongside a naval craft before blowing up both the naval craft and the "hijacked vessel".</p>
              <p>Alternatively, Al Qaeda operatives with some more daring Somali pirates could board a naval warship in the dark of night, and takeover the entire vessel.</p>
              <p>Our LST is especially vulnerable with low open passages - near the waterline - on both sides of the ship running towards the aft section, the personnel on guard duty will have to be extra alert to any divers attempting to climb onboard.</p>
              <p>With a small crew onboard, and half strength on duty at night, the vessel becomes more vulnerable to being hijacked.</p>
              <p>It will be the attention seeking publicity that Al Qaeda need.</p>

              <p>I can think of a few scenarios that the a speedboad full of Somaili pirates hijacking a ship or even on a collision course and still not fired upon by UN or US forces.</p>
              <p>Sorry no details, pirates got internet too.</p>
