            <div class='col-md body'>i have been throught both Navy and Army BMT...<br><br>though the Navy bmt module does not include field camp, and the route march is only 8km max...i can say that...the navy bmt was more physically and mentally stressful...our instructors were also from SISPEC...till now i fcuking detest them...really sadist bunch of mofos. Us smokers especially were almost treated like dogs...with the instructors hanging a cigarette like a bone. They always said that us Navy recruits have an easy life after passing out from BMT...so when they tekan us they are doing us a favour...I don't know how the current bunch of instructors are like, but my batch....curse them.<br><br>I recall one incident. We were sleeping in the middle of the night...when the fire alarm rang. All of us had to fall in for a simulated fire drill. Once we all fell in, the tekan session started. I won't say how much shit we did for fear of drawing comparisions or people talking shit...but enough to make quite a few people vomit. After that we had a water parade. When my spec walked up to me to check if my water bottle was full, (it was only less than a CM from the brim) he whacked the bottle out of my hand, it hit my face. He then picked it up and hurled it away, and told me i had 10 seconds to find my water bottle. As it was dark, i had a hard time finding it. Once my time was up he knocked the whole coy down while i was still blindly looking for it, and he still had the cheek to say, "nevermind slowly take ur time, ur friends are suffering because of you."<br><br>After the tekan session, we were ordered to change into our smartest 4 and standby cupboard in 10 mins time. Possible? Many of us had our smart 4 sleeves pulled down, cupboards messed up, beds overturned, everything in/out in 30 seconds, i think the older soldiers here know the drill...<br><br>The weird thing is, even though that night was a nightmare, i think i learned more about discipline and ESP integrity that night than in my whole life before...so i guess tekan sessions DO help to a certain extent...one huge test of mental and physical endurance...though its nothing compared to the NDU's Hell Week... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_twisted.gif" alt="Twisted Evil" title="Twisted Evil"></div>
