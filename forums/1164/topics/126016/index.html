            <div class='col-md body'>My good man, first of all, there is a very good reason for all these. The logic is already behing the name: BMT = <strong>BASIC</strong> Military training. It need not be tough or gung-ho since you're being introduced to the basic principles and aspects of Mil training. The actual training as a fighting unit comes after that.<br><br>You dun do practical before you understand the theories, do you? If you do, thats a recipe for disaster.</div>
