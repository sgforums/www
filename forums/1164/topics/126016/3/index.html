            <div class='col-md body'>Why question BMT training methods and the logic behind serving NS?<br><br>War is stupid and illogical. It's not likely Singapore will start any wars but in case someone is stupid enough to come and attack us, we want to make sure they all go home in little pieces.<br><br>That's all, nothing logical or meaningful about it.<br><br>When war comes to Singapore, I want to be shooting back instead of hiding. Even when I am 60, if I still have OK eyesight I want to be fighting instead of hiding. So, yes, I think everyone should continue serving NS.<br><br>Some srmy training methods should be questioned. But you must realized that the most important thing about military training is to train you to stop thinking and react automatically to situations.<br><br>Fir example, in Thailand training, the Thai soldiers refer to the SG soldiers as robots.<br><br>Why?<br><br>When patrolling in the forest, a shot is fired. All the Thai soldiers hit the ground. Some SAF soldiers, stood around looking for where the shot came from. Which, when you think about it, is the logical thing to do.<br><br>That's why military training is to stop you from thinking, but to react first.<br><br>Some training are stupid. During my BMT, the stupid instructors used to give us 10mins to clean our weapons after training. And then they give us "stand-by-rifle" where they found faults and happily punished everyone. These inspections and punishments lasts for up to TWO HOURS.<br><br>During our session with the OO, without the instructors present, I stood up and said that if the instructors really wanted our rifles to be clean, they should give us more time to clean our weapons, not 10mins.<br><br>We immediately got more time to clean our weapons from then on.[/url]</div>
