The push ups were done on the hot tar road under the blistering afternoon sun; the pushups also varied from diamond to knuckle to the std pushups. The cadets were also subjected to punishment like "touch the backgate and come back", ranger jumps, change parades and the like.<br><br>In terms of discipline, cadets were expected to jump to every command, however absurd. I remember when 20+ cadets were told to squeeze into a toilet cubilcle as punishment! I also remember instances where cadets were awoken at night for PT!<br><br>Now, it would be difficult to get the cadets just to shut up! The change is amazing!</div></blockquote>Please lor.. now if teachers in charge or CLT make the cadets do push up on the hot tar road parents start to complain. Nowadays some schools even ban practices such as push ups on hot tar road, running in afternoon sun and other petty stuff due to the endless complaints from parents.</div>

This is to avoid contravene geneva conventions on use of 'child soliders'.<br><br>Scouts were used in UK and Singapore during WWII b/cos they are considered 'youth movements' like the YMCA, Red-Cross/St John's and Boys/Girls bridgade (church movement). During the Second WW in UK, the UK equal of the NCC (name escapes me) were immediately disbanded b/cos above concerns.<br><br>In reality - Para-miltary organizations are more like armed bands linked to political parties or religious organizations. They are a dime a dozen in Indonesia etc. Such para-miltary units include the Bre-Mob (Police reserve), Force Ankarta (local militia) are oftern armed, discplined on military lines and uniformed. These guys can be as tough as our guardsmen without the sophisticated armoury.</div>
