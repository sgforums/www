            <div class='col-md body'>As everyone here probably knows Israeli advisors disguised as Mexicans helped Singapore build her armed forces since 1965.<br><br>As advisors of nascent armed forces it would have been only natural for the Israelis to recommend weapon systems for the SAF.<br><br>The SAF's first tank was the French-made AMX-13, which was used by the Israeli army in the Six Day War in 1967 and the Sinai Campaign in 1956, and the Israelis vetoed British offers of planes and helicopters except Hawker Hunter fighters.<br><br>(See "Foundations Of The Air Force" at <a href="http://www.singapore-window.org/sw05/040818id.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.singapore-window.org/sw05/040818id.htm</a>)<br><br>Singaporean leaders originally planned in 1966 to build an air force comprised of 12 Canberra bombers and 40 Hunter fighters according to Tim Huxley's book "Defending the Lion City: The Armed Forces of Singapore." But instead of British-made Canberra bombers Singapore decided to buy secondhand A-4 Skyhawks from the US in 1972.<br><br>I suspect the decision to acquire A-4 Skyhawks, which were also used by the Israelis since late 1967, could have been influenced by the Israeli advisors' recommendation. Anyone has anything to shed some light on the subject?<br><br>Cheers,<br>Sunho</div>
