              <p>I think many of us here agree that, while good, our old SAF SAW can probably do with a bit of updating. The constant-recoll is a given, so that's fixed. Same with the 5.56, otherwise it won't be classed as a SAW/LMG but other than that, what would YOU love to see on our SAW?</p>
              <p>My love list :)</p>
              <p>1) P-rails to bring it to international standards.</p>
              <p>2) 1.5x scope</p>
              <p>3) a magwell for SAR mags</p>
              <p>4) Plastic sliding trigger similar to the SAR. Helps stop people from "jerking" the trigger upwards with every shot.</p>
              <p>------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p>
              <p>Optional</p>
              <p>1) Bullpuping the thing, so that the trigger is brought further forward. This can allow for the removel of the buttstock and the shaping of the rear of the SAW into a stock like structure, making the SAW even shorter. It's not like the butt-stock serves a functional purpose other than a cheekrest, if we can do without it, why not?</p>
              <p>2) A higher capacity mag in the 50-75 round range. Got an idea for a J-mag with the SAR-21 catch, but if used straight, it might get side heavy, so sideloading where the J sits on the top of the SAW? Side benefit that it might be usable with the SAR, though the side heavy problem will remain.</p>
              <p>------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p>
              <p>My "please keep these" list:</p>
              <p>1) The bayonett-just in case</p>
              <p>2) The bipod</p>
              <p>3) The front grip</p>
              <p>These are still useful.</p>

              <p>My understanding from a specialist in Ordnance is the low weight is the price of using that folded sheet metal construction (with paint finish). This is the same chippy finish applied to SAR-80, SAR-88 and M-16S1.</p>
              <p>Move towards machined parts and the weapon will approach M-249 weight. He doesn't know if the alloy used is lighter but more prone to corrosion.</p>

              <p>I rather not raise the ROF, any faster and it becomes uncontrollable. You tried M-16 on rock and roll? I totally couldn't keep it steady, and it was 600 rpm only, the knockback recoil was terrible.</p>

              <p>Darkness, hell no, the 249 is totally unsuitable to our terrain, canting it past 60 degrees, like firing it up a stairwell causes the belt to tumble in the pouch and jams when the feed tries to load a twisted belt in. Not to mention almost 2x as heavy and with a kick like a mule. Our physical stature can't take too much of that.</p>
              <p>Digital counter. Hard to make one that reads the amount of rounds left. Maybe if you assume you'll always load a full mag, that makes it easier to count, reset to max then count down, but I can't see how it can be made both small and able to read a half loaded mag.</p>
              <p>Pedo, we really need that bayonett, the SAR is without one, take the SAW one away and we won't be able to do mine clearing/escape drills anymore. Unless it's the hard way. Not to mention at VERY close range, the one with a bladed close combat weapon has the advantage. The kind of situation likely in MOUT. Which is our defensive operating terrain. Remember, in WWI trench terrain the biggest killer wasn't a pistol or rifle, it was the shovel, so I can see how close combat physical weapons still have it's place.</p>

              <p>The belt feed system isn't substantial enough to make the difference between 4.8kg and the 7-8kg of a MG-4/M-249/K-4. The difference will mostly come into loaded weight. Maybe these weapons are for more mechanized users. For them, you might want to consider belt feed as it is more reliable than high cap mags.</p>
              <p>The Ultimax is a very good midpoint between an AR-upsize and an MG-downsize (more like a heavier AR-18, with better cooling and changeable barrel). But our doctrine primarily employs 30 around mags, I wonder why they don't just issue an AR derivative.</p>
              <p>I'm all for weight reduction, especially when it comes to MOUT. Maybe the 2.0 could be an AR-upsize for issue only to light infantry gunners. Make a 3.0 with belt feed and give it to the AI. Every kg counts towards spinal and ankle injuries too.</p>
              <p>I suspect SAF will not be so much against the guns, as against producing a linked 5.56 variety.</p>

              <p>Though I was also thinking along the lines of what you were thinking alise. The AI isn't too in need of new MGs though, they got the GPMG and the 40/50 to back them up, and if it gets worrying, there's always the 35mm and Mr 105mm. It's the poor pure infantry that's a bit short on stopping power. Backpack ammo-ed 7.62? Another design for another day, now is Ultimax.</p>

              <p>for the Ultimax being in the LMG role !it still have to be able to do a sustain firing ! the current 30 rd ain't gonna cut it! tha drws down to the faulty 100 rd drum or the betaC mag! which has some jamming issues in the sandbox...I guess another reason the U100 was kick out of the US Marines LAR project! and last we heard the HK and LWRC got the contract!</p>

              <p>My dad is one of the original AR-15 HBAR gunners. But that's 1967 tech. If a barrel is exposed instead of shrouded in handgrip, and bolt is heavier duty, it won't overheat. This is implemented in the RPK. SAF doesn't issue a high cap mag anyway.</p>
              <p>In the XM-8, the long barrel is the same for LMG and designated marksman versions. This is a good way to add firepower to a section without adding more men. In practice, I'm not sure if barrel wear will matter.</p>
              <p>Backpack 7.62? SAF tried this in the 60s. They had a tripod back then. One guy WORE it, he bent over, the gunner mounted the weapon on him (pun intended) and fired away. Imagine the hot cases falling on his tight temasek green blouse. Sian.</p>

              <p>Dave, the IAR project didn't use 100 round mags for any of the contenders, so how can you say it was that lack that disqualified the U100? Shouldn't ALL the entries be disqualified then?</p>
              <p>As for the 30 rounds... well.. we can make do with rapid reloading, though the gunner will curse and swear. The ROF will be constant enough, not like it's totally a 10 second pause where you can go for a quick toilet break. Besides, I already mentioned the possible improved mag in the original post.</p>

              <p>They probably figured they needed the MG more than they needed an extra rifle. There were pictures in some WWII books I have of some Russian using his buddy as an MG rest so he can kneel and fire his MG at aircraft, so it's hardly unique and a very old practice.</p>

              <p>I was around when they tried to fit a 120mm motar into an M-113. It fired fine, but when it came time to move, the repeated shocks threw the tracks of the -113, so I guess that was why they had to come up with the SRAM. It was an.. interesting.. test. Same with pallet dropping a SM-1. Broke the suspension. Interesting times, interesting times.</p>

              <p>Nope, no crew. Guess they wanted to give the guards/cdos a bit more followup punch. Failed though. Nothing I can find on Razeng indicated an armour drop was carried out.</p>
              <p>The US had the M1064 carrier, that was ok. Have no idea why ours throw track. Maybe different motar? Ours probably had a higher peak ground pressure. Or maybe our $1 M-113s finally couldn't take it, too old. :)</p>

              <p>Airlifting armour goes beyond raiding and recon. I wonder if we had enough C-130 to maintain an airhead, particularly if it is far from our lines.</p>
              <p>Definitely a move aimed at Malaysia. Wonder if the destination was the Klang river valley to get at the principal port, main population centre and capital.</p>
