              <p>for a LMG to be using 30 rders is kind of a handicap ... since the U100 did not have a better feeding system, it is another handicap to the system.  that 2 hole mod that we have on the SAW is just way too flimsy.... maybe this 60 and 100 rd mags made by SUrefire might be an answer! but again! they got to have a better way to secure the AR magazines when you have such heavier loadings! </p>

              <p>as for controllability in FA! it is not all about the ROF... somtimes the weight and balance and of course technique on controlling a full auto fire  ! mag dumps on my M4 having a 850 rpm controls much better than the M16A1 or the FNC!</p>
              <p>Anywya! my point being we have a good system on the U100! but it still fall short on things so minor !!</p>

              <p>Dave, which part of my original post said I disagree on the mag that you've to try so hard to convince me? I agree on the mag increase, so please stop trying to preach to the choir. Dual feedpath mags have a flaw in that if you're unlucky enough to have 2 rounds feeding through the common path at the same time, it jams. Anyway, moot point. With a standardized magwell, it should take all M-16/4 compatible mags regardless of who made it. Unfortunately, we no longer use M-16/4 compatible mags...</p>
              <p>I'm actually not too worried on the 30 rounders though, fire control is such that you fire in short bursts, not long chains of FA fire, you can slip a mag change in among the fire breaks fairly easily. FA full dumps is for the range or if you're in so much shit that you're outnumbered 20 to 1 without support. Which unfortunately sometimes happen, but is not so common as depicted in media. Though I would be happier if they could solve the problem.</p>
              <p>alise, wonder if we can quick convert a C-130 for that :) After all, we got the guns and the bird, just need the fire control.</p>

              <p>Agree, which is why the barrel shroud can't be reduced further in length as then the foregrip becomes too close. No way we can get a 30cm SAW, best case is probably a snub-nosed 100 round (maybe) 5.56 SAW, where the barrel don't protrude too much.</p>
              <p>I'm more worried about the engineering. To bullpup a conventional rifle, you'll really have to butcher the original design from the ground up. All you have to do is recite prayers and you can probably market it as halal. (I just had an image of an NSman chewing on his gun... yummy...). That's funny hyperbole and exaggeration for those of you who didn't get it.</p>
              <p>Mag position has to change, trigger grip has to move forward, barrel moves back, P-rail optics cannot interfere with new mag position etc. A major redesign.</p>

              <p>Hope weight doesn't increase with bullpup. Actually no one has noticed how the SAR-21 looks like the QBZ-95. The QBZ is quite light though with a barrel only 2 inches shorter. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/QBZ-95</p>
              <p>(More interesting is the new QJY-88 "GMPG" which fires their standard rifle round and weights less than an M-249. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/QJY-88)</p>
              <p>Sad that the one exception when the govt will not look East is when quality really counts.</p>
              <p>One more point for you: a SAW should have an exposed barrel for cooling. Ultimax gives a vertical foregrip, a horizontal one can be included in M-16/M-203 style with holes for airflow &amp; drying, just small enough to block fingers.</p>
