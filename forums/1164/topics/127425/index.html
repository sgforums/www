            <div class='col-md body'>Just want to highlight this case...<br><br>1. The bribery which took place in which 1 former SAF scholar offered $500,000 in order to know the amount quoted by rival companies..<br><br>In the newspaper, it was mentioned that he did it for "fun"....<br><br>A. Why would someone offer $500,000 out of the blue for "fun"?<br>B. As a former SAF scholar, he would have known the consequences of bribery<br>C. A normal scholar , if he got $500,000...Why would he get the quotes ?<br><br>- He can't do anything with it..<br>- Nobody would spend $500,000 just to know how much other companies quoted...which is completely useless info if he was not affiliated to any company which could use the information to his advanage..<br><br>Unless...<br><br>1. He is related to EADS and able to pass the information on..<br>But during the trial..the judge cleared EADS of any wrongdoings...<br>and he was sentenced to 8 weeks, i supposed..<br><br>I suspect a bigger power is above this..<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>SINGAPORE (AFP) - European aerospace giant EADS has denied any link to a bribery scandal over a naval helicopter contract in Singapore and has suggested the affair had been "manipulated" to damage the company's reputation.<br><br>The European Aeronautic Defence and Space Company (EADS) issued a statement claiming it has no association with a man charged with trying to bribe a Singaporean defence ministry official.<br><br>"Neither EADS, nor its helicopter subsidiary Eurocopter, has any relationship with the person," the statement said.<br><br>"As a matter of corporate policy, EADS fully complies with all applicable legislation in every country where it does business.<br><br>ADVERTISEMENT<br><br>"EADS has no insight into how this rumour surfaced but the company suspects that it is a manipulation intended to damage the company's interests and reputation."<br><br>EADS did not elaborate on who it believed was behind the alleged manipulation.<br><br>The man at the centre of the scandal, Singaporean Eng Heng Chiaw, 46, was charged in the Subordinate Court on Tuesday with offering the defence ministry official 500,000 Singapore dollars (305,000 US) to secure tender details about an EADS competitor for a naval helicopter contract.<br><br>A copy of the charge sheet submitted to court said Eng offered the money to Sin Boon Wah, a deputy chief executive for strategic development at Singapore's Defence Science and Technology Agency, as a "gratification sum".<br><br>The offer was an inducement to obtain information "about the price offered by the competitor in a naval helicopter project so that a company, European Aeronatics Defence and Space (EADS) SEA P/L, could price its offer to secure the said project," the charge sheet said.<br><br>The charge sheet, given to AFP by Singapore's Corrupt Practices and Investigation Bureau, said Eng made his bribery attempt at a local food court on September 20 last year.<br><br>It gave no details about Eng's relationship to EADS although the Straits Times newspaper described him in a report on Wednesday as a "business consultant" who used to work for a defence ministry agency.<br><br>The contract in question was for six naval helicopters which the Singapore government announced last month had been awarded to Sikorsky Aircraft Corp. from the United States.<br><br></div>
