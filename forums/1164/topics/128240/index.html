            <div class='col-md body'>After reading a couple of posts at a firearms forum, that barrel length doesn't have any effect on accuracy, I started to wonder. Of course I'm not talking about a barrel so long that it touches the target <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"> .<br><br><blockquote>I keep seeing this come up on gun forums all over the net and even here. I don't understand how a longer barrel could possibly give you more accuracy. As far as I can tell a longer barrel increases velocity but not accuracy. You may have to hold the sights a little higher with a 14.5" compared to a 20" but that doesn't mean it is less accurate. I've always been taught that accuracy is affected by barrel tension, rifling, ammo, bolt mechanism (?), and the shooter. Am I wrong or is this truly a common misconception in the gun community?</blockquote>A few of the replies.<br><blockquote>Depends on your definition of accuracy.<br><br>Longer barrels dont help precision but do help accuracy. Easier to get rounds nearer the target due to less drop at range (accuracy) but not smaller groups (precision). Here in the gun forums we call precision accuracy...</blockquote><blockquote>1) barrel length increases velocity, not accuracy per se.<br>2) longer sight radius is more accurate for a given shooter<br>3) use of optics negates sight radius<br>4) quality control of ammo (i.e. "match" grade stuff) will affect accuracy a lot more than bbl. length</blockquote>So does a longer barrel make a weapon more accurate or is this a myth?<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Yes longer barrel gives you better acurracy but there is a point of diminishing returns.<br><br>Soon the centre of gravity of the gun is in front and aiming it becomes a non trivial matter.<br><br>In addition you have to worry about warping of the barrel and cooling.  As the gun gas takes longer to exit from mouth of the barrel, a lot more of the heat goes into the barrel.  After a few shots the barrel may not be true.

            <div class='col-md body'>Accuracy depends on so many factors of a weapon, its ammo, its internal mechanisms etc.<br><br>But if we are talking about the barrel alone, then I think - yes, as a general rule, a longer barrel gives you more accuracy.<br><br>Of course we shouldn't compare a revolver with an M-16 - apologies CenturionMBT - there are just too many other differences besides the barrel length to make a fair comparison.<br><br>So let's narrow down the differences to just the barrel length. Let's compare an M-16A2 (21-inch barrel) with a M-4 (16-inch barrel). Both have the same rifling twist (I think). It's a simple conclusion - the M-16A2 wins.<br><br>A longer barrel makes the bullet spin through more rifling grooves which steadies the bullet before it leaves the barrel.<br><br>But there are other factors. I think that a heavier (ie thicker) barrel offers more accuracy as it is more rigid. Also, I think when making barrels intended for sporting guns and sniping purposes have different forging methods that are normally too expensive for normal assault rifles.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hmm! Without trying to sound too technical on the subject, why don't a simple test be conducted on the subject?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_neutral.gif" alt="Neutral" title="Neutral"><br><br>Ooh! There's no need to actually use a rifle for the test since the subject is about the barrel.  Just take 2 barrel/ pipes of different length but equal thickness &amp; using equal amount of gas to fire off a projectile at a target of the same distance.  The result of the test should be able to give you a rough but clearer ideal as to whether the length of a barrel affects accuracy.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"></div>
