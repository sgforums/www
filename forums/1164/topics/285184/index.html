            <div class='col-md body'>Just back (to SH) after 2 weeks in San Francisco.<br><br>One afternoon was spent at an indoor range wiith my gf.<br><br>The range was called Jackson Arms <a href="http://www.jacksonarms.com/index.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.jacksonarms.com/index.html</a> and according to their website was the closest range to downtown SF.<br><br>It was quite easy to find once we had instructions on transportation etc.<br><br>It was a unassuming looking shop with a glass cabinet of pistols - mostly Glocks - and a few long guns. California does not allow AR-type weapons apparently. So all they had was a couple of shotguns, a MAC-10-type with long barrel, a scoped hunting rifle and some others I can't remember.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Since I was quite unfamiliar with pistols (apart from realistic bb guns), and becos I was with my gf, we decided to sign up for their "novice shooter" course.<br><br>While waiting for our instructor to show up, we observed the people running the shop and the customers that came in.<br><br>A lot of orientals - some Koreans, some Chinese - and some caucasians showed up to shoot, or simply to just talk about their pistols which they carry in black plastic cases.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Our Novice Shooter package costs USD50 each including a 100 rounds of .22 ammo each.<br><br>A very friendly young latino chap was our instructor and he sat us in a room and gave us the basics of firearms handling and shooting using a .22 target pistols that looked like this one:<br><img src="http://www.gunblast.com/images/Ruger50/pistol02.jpg"><br><br>The instruction was thorough - especially about safety aspects. It is a good refresher even for someone like us whom have shot thousands of 5.56 rounds.<br><br>After about 20 mins we proceeded to the indoor range and the guy basically handed us a pistol, 200 rounds of ammo, assigned us a lane and left us to our devices after supervising a couple of mags and is satisfied we're not gonna harm ourselves or anyone accidentally.<br><br>The .22 is a joy to shoot as it is very accurate and very low recoil and report. And loading the magazines were easy as you can pull the light magazine spring down and just slot the little rounds into the mag.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>We had a 100 rounds each to shoot and after a while it got really boring. The .22 pistol was relatively light so holding it up and shooting 100 rounds was no problem.<br><br>For a first time pistol shooter, I was putting 95% of my shots into a 10-inch area at 15 to 18 m no problem. My gf, shooting for the very first time in her life, was doing equally well at 5 to 8 m.<br><br>As you can see the co.ocking action of our .22 pistol is like pulling a pinball plunger and not like a slide action semi-auto.<br><br>After about 150 rounds the action became sluggish and there were several IAs.<br><br>The bunch of oriental teens we saw earlier with their personal pistols were shooting next to us. One had a nice Colt 1911 .45 type pistol. They stayed only for a short time and some of them were probably being introduced to shooting by their more experienced friends for the first time. Shots were landing on the floor etc and I think that may have explained why they had to leave so soon. You couldn't hear much with the ear protection on.<br><br>Later on, a middle age oriental man was shooting in the lane next to us with some really big calibre pistols including a scoped magnum revolver.

            <div class='col-md body'>The range itself was quite well-maintained.<br><br>It has many lanes all equipped with the electrical pulley system for pinning up your own targets.

            <div class='col-md body'>By now my gf had stopped shooting as the 9mm was a little too loud.<br><br>I'm sure even those who have never been in an indoor range can imagine how loud it is.<br><br>The first thing I found surprising about the 92F was... how bloody difficult it was to load a double-stacked 9mm magazine. The spring was STRONG!<br><br><img src="http://www.helstongunsmiths.com/shop/images/beretta-92f.jpg"><br><br>I think the pistol I used was a regular 92F and the capacity is 15rds, or even if it was the compact 92FS model it is still 13rds in the mag.<br><br>The first time, after much struggling, I managed to load in 9 rds.<br><br>Loading 29 rounds into a M16 mag is a breeze compared to this. The 9mm rounds are small and smooth making it hard to grip. My fingers were never very strong and that my left thumb was cut earlier when loading the .22 magazine didn't help either.<br><br>At the end, I was loading in only 6 rds into the mag before I gave up and started shooting at the USD 1 paper targets.</div>

If the magazine is new and the spring not quite 'broken in' yet, then yes, it can be hard to load the last few cartridges against the almost-fully-compressed mag spring. As the mag gets used, the spring loosens up some and loading the mag to its full capacity becomes easier.<br><br>(The flip side is that a overly-worn mag spring may not exert sufficient upward pressure on the stacked cartridges, causing them to not feed reliably into the chamber.)<br><br>Most of my autoloaders have black finishes on them, the sole exception being one of my CZ 75Bs which is finished in satin nickel. My three revolvers have stainless steel finishes.<br><br>Trust me, that 'kid in a candy store' feeling that you get when walking into a gun store doesn't go away even for someone who's been involved in the sport for many years.
