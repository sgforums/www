This soldier broke the record that MGS Carlos made back in Vietnam.  However, MGS Carlos used was a M2  with an attached scope.

Because of the stabilizer elements, it takes a considerable shock to set off this reaction; lighting the C-4 with a match will just make it burn slowly, like a piece of wood (in Vietnam, soldiers actually burned C-4 as an improvised cooking fire). Even shooting the explosive with a rifle won't trigger the reaction. Only a detonator, or blasting cap will do the job properly. </blockquote>from <a href="http://people.howstuffworks.com/c-4.htm" rel="nofollow">http://people.howstuffworks.com/c-4.htm</a><br><br></div>

The advantage of MSG90 is that it is automatic and more rounds.<br><br>The thinking of this is in harrasment mission, the objective is hang around to disrupt the routines or operation of the enemy, thus will be sort of now and then shoot at the enemy, to make them jumpy, keeping their head down, and disrupting their rest , food or their work. Most will think that MSG90 advantage is that it offer more round and automatic so you don't have to move to reload , and shoot faster at opportunities.<br><br>I don't agree on that, I think i rather go for SSG. Why, you are going to hang around for days, so the lightest rifle will be best, to move around and long time aiming. The case of more rounds and don't have to reload, is questionable, as when enemy is harrassed by sniper, everyone is out to spot him, machine guns and mortar, artililary, patrols so usually only one shot is taken now and then to reduce the risk of discovery. In fact , the chance of him have to get away fast is very high, so the MSG 90 weight may not be suitable.<br><br></div>

This soldier broke the record that MGS Carlos made back in Vietnam.  However, MGS Carlos used was a M2  with an attached scope.  Which proves apoint that its the man &amp; not the weapon that kills.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mad.gif" alt="Mad" title="Mad"> </div></blockquote>2430m ?!<br><br>That's one helluva shot. Not taking any credit away from him but IMO it's somewhat like a fluke. He probably can't ever repeat the feat ever again under the exact same conditions.</div>

Honestly, the civilise world doesn't think to highly of a sniper being able to kill from an extended range. Especially girls don't like the ideal of the guy they know, being able to kill another man with 1 shot.
