            <div class='col-md body'>Remember reading from somewhere that a sniper in a real war really demoralised the enemies with his actions.   What he did was really simple.   Wait until an enemy got out of his foxhole, let him squat down to sh*it before letting him have it.   After a few sh*itters were shot this way, the others did not dare to go out and had to do their business in their foxholes.   This would be truly demoralising!</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I think your story about soldiers being shot by the enemy sniper while taking a crap, is similar to an expliot by Gunny Carlos Hathcock.<br><br>There was a V.C sniper that had been taking out Marines every day at a particular hour which resulted in making the lives of the Marines in the base uncomfortable.  It ended when the Gunny was dispatch to hunt &amp; silence that V.C sniper.</div>

Will they believe it? Nope.<br><br>Also, we must take into consideration the quality of the enemy. Mr Simo achieved his kill total against Soviet troops. Everybody knows that Soviets dont respond well to unexpected things. Everybody also knows that WWII era Soviet attacks were humongous. Nobody's going to miss a company or two.<br><br>SGT Hathcock, on the other hand, achieved his 93 kills against a formidable, tenacious, determined enemy.
