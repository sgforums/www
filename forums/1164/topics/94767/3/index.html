            <div class='col-md body'>If an Infantry company gets ambushed by an MG post, after going for cover, they aren't going to be just shitting on the spot.  They should respond with 40mm fired in the general direction of the MG, follow by a law rocket along with the support fire from the rest of the company.  And while this is going on the sniper &amp; spotter can move to an area where they can have a better view of where everyone is before scoping for the MG gunner. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_eek.gif" alt="Shocked" title="Shocked"><br><br>BTW, today the role of the spotter in U.S military is usually shared by the 2 men sniper team.  This is to reduce the stress to the designated sniper.  However, only military snipers should practice this habit.  Police sniper should never share a single sniper rifle. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_confused.gif" alt="Confused" title="Confused"><br><br>In U.S, the 'spotter' has a free range of arsenal that he can chose to carry as long as he is comfactable with it during his mission.  Most U.S army sniper/spotter prefer to carry a M14, M16 &amp; M16/203.  U.S Force Recon sniper/spotter would usually either carry M4 with scope &amp; silencer( optional ), M4/203, H&amp;K MP5SD, etc.<br><br>Ooh! Just for everyones info, .50cal sniper rifle is being widely during the start of the Iraq conflict.  And its sure as hell was used for anti-material.  Marines prefer to deploy 2 .50cal sniper gunners &amp; 1 7.62mm gunner as shooter/spotter.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>FYI, while its not common to hear, snipers usually work in a 4 man team. Deployment depends on what the situation is like, eg, 2 men can be shooter, 1 man spotter &amp; 1 man for security.  Or 1 shooter, 1 spotter, 2 security. etc.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>FYI, the U.S Marines are currently testing out a new material for uniforms that is claimed to be able to defeat heat detectors.  The principle of it is like the stealth fighters, meaning that it does not really make the wearer disappear or invincible but rather distort the heat signature of the wearer. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_eek.gif" alt="Shocked" title="Shocked"><br><br>Not sure if the material has been tested for sniper duties yet. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_confused.gif" alt="Confused" title="Confused"></div>
