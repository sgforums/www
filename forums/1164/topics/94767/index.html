            <div class='col-md body'>Carlos Hathcock a.k.a. Long Thrang(White Feather) is a person who is proud of his skill, looks up to the image of a marine, and not a man of many words, a simple man, simple and effective. Only under that classification can I rationalise his actions in vietnam. In reality a sniper is a cold blooded killer with a very powerful weapon. They all have a conscience, and the only way to prevent themselves from being victims of their own conscience is to not talk about who they killed. I have seen it in the eyes of a Royal Marine sniper.<br><br>A harrasment mission is one whereby no member of the offensive is taken down, though it may not be the case all the time. It is a mission to affect a large force using minimal personnel with the objective of delay or diversion while a larger force is gathered. It is not an end, but a means to an end. Its key to success is the confusion and fear that it generates. It lowers the moral of the enemy, it irritates them as the delay continues.<br><br>The effective harrassment range is between 800 to 1000 metres. Anything closer than that warrants a kill, though not a confirmed kill. A confirmed kill is most likely at 400m. Anything closer than that puts the sniper in unnecessary danger and should not be attempted.<br><br>Question: You are a sniper. You are travelling with your infantry company when you encounter suppressive fire from an MG post. What do you do?<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>FYI, by right a confirmed kill requires the witness of an officer.  However, due to the fact that an officer can't be every where at 1 time, the next person to witness( on be half of an officer ) the kill would be the sniper's spotter.  But signing off on the kill record still requires an officer.<br><br>BTW, snipers aren't really cold blooded or anti-social, they're just trying to suppress the horror that they have seen through the scope without pissing anyone off.  Honestly, the civilise world doesn't think to highly of a sniper being able to kill from an extended range. Especially girls don't like the ideal of the guy they know, being able to kill another man with 1 shot.  Strangely they prefer guys who kill another man up close &amp; personal, eg Commandos, Special Forces, etc.</div>

Cold blooded people are not really heartless; they just disconnect with their prey, disconnect with feeling that kill. And they piss alot of people off.<br><br>Yes I agree with you girls don't like snipers. The think of snipers as creepy and underhanded.
