            <div class='col-md body'>It's a damn fantastic Ship Class and I have been very impressed by the Ship capabilities from the day it was launched in 2000. Why isn't anyone knows about the Endurance class LPDs except us in SG.<br><br>Imagine with the Introduction of this LPDs, It has given SAF a whole new orbat and It takes a few capable ones to deeply fathom what it is.<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Endurance Class LPDs</span><br><br>The Endurance class LPDs are 40% larger and yet travels almost twice as fast as its predecessor. Each ship is fitted with a well dock which can accommodate four landing crafts, as well as a flight deck and hangar which can accommodate two medium lift helicopters ( 4 helis during active operations ). Super Pumas, Apaches and Chinooks had been certified to operate from the flight deck.<br><br>While the RSN describes the Endurance class as LSTs, they lack the beaching capability traditionally associated with LSTs and their well docks and flight decks qualify the Endurance class more as amphibious transport docks. The term "multipurpose support vessel" is closer to the intent of its use.<br><br>The Endurance class was built with a heavy emphasis on automation. The integrated bridge system allows the operator to access the navigation and communications systems, the ECDIS and other vital systems needed to sail the ship effectively, while the Ship Control, Monitoring and Management System controls, monitors and manages most of the platforms onboard. The ships are also equipped with a Aircraft Ship Integrated Secure and Traverse system which helps in landing, securing, manoeuvring and traversing a helicopter, and eliminates the need for deck personnel to secure helicopters upon landing. All these result in a high degree of automation, with a reduced manning requirement of 65 crew members for a 6000-tonne ship. Each LPD can also carry 350 troops, 18 armoured vehicles ( tanks ) and 30 'B' Vehicles (1080tons).<br><br>The Endurance class are armed with 2 20mm Typhoon Naval Optronic Stabilized Weapon Platforms, 4 .50Cal HMGs, 16cell Barak 2 Anti Air/Anti Missile system and a 76mm Super rapid Gun. It is rumored that in the future, the LPDs will be armed with NAVLAR Area saturation rockets system.<br><br>The ships are active participants in multinational peacekeeping efforts. As part of SingaporeÂ’s contribution to the reconstruction efforts in Iraq, RSS Endurance was sent to the Persian Gulf in October 2003 for two months. RSS Resolution followed in November 2004 and RSS Endeavour in February 2006. The ships conducted logistical tasks, such as replenishing supplies for other naval vessels in the Persian Gulf, and conducted patrols to enforce maritime presence. They also served as a platform for helicopter missions and maritime boarding operations missions by teams from other coalition countries when they inspected ships leaving Iraq. The last deployment saw the RSS Resolution taking on the expanded role of taking charge of coalition and Iraqi Navy ships to defend Iraq's oil platforms. On 1 September 2007, RSS Persistence became the fourth ship to be deployed to the Persian Gulf in support of the multinational reconstruction efforts in Iraq.<br><br>SPARTAN was operationaly deployed for the first time by the Singapore Navy in the Persian Gulf on anti-terror and security operations along the Iraqi coast. In this case, an unmanned (but armed) USV is greatly preferred to a manned vessel in checking on suspicious-looking dhows and what-not, especially as there was a possibility that they were sucide craft like the one that hit the Cole of Yemen. And the Spartans used by the RSN were deployed from Endurance class LPDs, which not only had the capacity to remain on station for weeks at a time, but also carried the proper weapons (.50 calibre HMGs, 20mm cannons, armed Super Puma helios and naval commandos) to deal with small craft threats.<br><br>The ships were also involved in various humanitarian relief operations, such as the tsunami-hit Indonesian province of Aceh in 2004. Within a few days of the disaster, the RSS Endurance sailed to Aceh in Indonesia to deliver emergency supplies and medical personnel to aid in the relief efforts. She was then joined by RSS Persistence on 4 January 2005 and RSS Endeavour on 16 January. The LPDs relief deployment raised alot of eyebrows of our neighbours b'coz of its fast response.<br><br>My Comment :<br><br>Just let your imagination run wild, a  battle group consisting of  2 LPDs, one a command ship, the other in support role, each with 2 Super Pumas and 2 Apaches, supported by 3 Endurance Class Frigates and their S70B Naval Helicopters. and protected further by 2 Submarines. One based in Singapore Straits/South China Sea and the other at the Strait of Malacca/Indian Ocean.<br><br>Or in the case of Amphibious operations, each battle group carrying one Guards Battalion, 36 Tanks and 60 Vehicles. Just Imagine.<br><br></div>
