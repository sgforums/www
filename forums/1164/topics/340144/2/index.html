              <p>They did a 4-round MRSI, six times.</p>
              <p>And in each of the 4-round MRSI volleys, the 4 rounds landed within 4 seconds of each other.  </p>
              <p>The 6 times was probably done to get an average time delay between the first n fourth round.</p>

              <p>its called, you post crap, expect crap responses. you reap what you sow. you talk trash, you get trash responses. when you are trash, i guess you gotta live with the rest of the rubbish i suppose.</p>
              <p>NLOS FCS and you want to compare it to the Primus ? might as well i compare the sopwith camel with the F86 sabre or with the Mig 17. or compare the spitfire with the F22.</p>
              <p>different generations apart. so should i compare your intelligence with a 3 year old kid at kindergarden ? of course i should, going by your M109 and Primus comparison, i should. i bet the 3 y.o kid will pwn your ass anyway.</p>
              <p>if you dont respect facts and figures and choose to continue with your bigotry, you will end up self-pwning again, as you always do.</p>
              <p>you are practically mentally challenged to stoop so low to get attention. why ? no one at defence talk bothers about you ? no one loves you ? escaped from IMH ?</p>
