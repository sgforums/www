            <div class='col-md body'>Nowadays, applying for exit permit is very easy, you can just go to HttP://www.MIW.com.sg and yes you have to apply for exit permit as long as it is more than 24 hrs..... ur bf can go anywhere during this period but if he is to go overseas during his service time he will need to inform his unit about it..... PTP is rougly ard 2 mths and BMT 3 mths.... this is a rough gauge but it will be slightly less than that....<br>total of around 4.5 mths.... 1 week is confinement week after that visitors will be able to visit 2 week and by the 3rd week can book out..... actually your Bf can still take his NAFA test between now and the early june if he manage to get a silver he will not have to go into PTP. The booking out every week will not be confirm as sometimes he will get confinements or due to training purposes.....<br></div>
