            <div class='col-md body'>Actually,I would not bother to speculate whether Singapore has covert units or not. I believe if the SAF wants to be modern , flexible and from its history has mostly followed the US and Isreali doctrine...  you can bet that we will have units like the Mossad or the covert US group ( even more covert than Delta Force).<br><br>Many, many years ago, no one thot we had the equivalent of the SAS ... but now our SOF is pretty open knowledge.<br><br>Now we have the first Military intel battalion.... from what I read, it seems that it is modeled after the UK's  14 th Intelligence Co...<br><br>We Singaporeans are great at taking ideas from others and adapting... so I am not surprised... whatever you can guess exists in other foreign forces , I am sure we have something equivalent.</div>
