            <div class='col-md body'>when i was still serving my ns, heard rumours that ns will be extended to 3 years.<br><br>now they changing to 2 years instead, really glad for my 2 younger brothers.<br><br>anyway, i believe the whole structure would be changed in the SAF now.<br><br>eg) an infantry spec take like 6-7months from a recruit to a 3SG, then join an infantry unit for the next 2year for one whole mono-intake. If now they ord 6 months eariler, the unit will need a new batch of specs. it wouldnt be easy for men and spec to gel up quickly and imagine the result of ATEC.<br><br>*Shrug* maybe i am thinking too much , hahahaha. Still Cheers for all the new soldiers!!</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>This is a very huge change that will be phased in gradually. All current NSFs who need to serve 2 years 6 months (including current disruptees) get an immediate two month reduction in service requirement, to an earliest ORD date of 30 June 2004. (That means that you need to serve only 4 months on your return from your studies, Leo_is_me.) Those enlisting in the July 2004 to November 2004 batches will get a 4 month reduction (i.e. 2 years 2 months). Those enlisting with the December 2004 batch or later will all serve 2 years. There is an 8-week reduction for scoring a silver or better in NAPFA to a minimum of 1 year 10 months.<br><br>I am not so sure this is a good idea. This particularly affects the training of officers. The training of specialists and certain difficult vocations (like commandoes) will also be made very hard. There will barely be enough time for these people to gel together with their unit before they ORD, since their training takes so long. This may actually undermine moves toward a 3G force.<br><br>Maybe SAF is moving toward a flatter command structure with fewer officers? Or will improved training technology step in to help? Maybe officers, specialists and the tough vocations can be trained on the job (OTJ)?<br><br>For example, officer cadets could receive a relatively short 10-15 week primer course at OCS. After this course, they are sent to their eventual unit and shadow a particular officer. This officer will be their mentor and responsible for completing their training. This will be like a correspondence course with CAI technology. These cadets should even go to ATEC as a cadet and lead men there in a section commander or platoon sergeant role. After 6 months or so, they could return to OCS for a few weeks of summary exercises and final prociency tests before receiving their commissions and returning to their unit. Cadets who drop out will still return to their unit, but as specialists. Actually, this form of training might be even better than the current 42-week OCS. At least the new 2LT will be less blur about unit life and will have met the men he is to lead and know what they expect of him. In this way, the officer will be able to gel with his unit earlier, and training in the units might also be improved.<br><br>Regardless, this is a huge change. My head is spinning thinking of the connotations. This is the first time both commanders and men have the same length of NS. Before the 2.5 years for corporals and above, it was 3 years for officers and 2 years for WOSEs. The difference in time it takes to train commanders vs men will have many manpower officers tearing their hair out. Let's see what will happen.</div>
