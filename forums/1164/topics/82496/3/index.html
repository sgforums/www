The duration of the basic military service is eight months. This can either be done in one go, or as a service of six months with regular weapon exercises of several days as member of the Miliz until the duration of eight months is reached.<br><br>Military alternative service or civil service is possible in place of the compulsory military service. Its duration is 12 months and can be performed at different organizations.<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">China (PRC)</span><br>The People's Republic of China has conscription for both men and women. Women who are conscripted go to the army for two months and learn to fire guns. .<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Finland</span><br>As of 2004, Finland has mandatory military service of at least six months, depending on the assigned position: those trained as officers serve for twelve months, specialty troops serve for nine months, and other rank and file serve for six months. Women can serve, if they choose. Civilian service of 13 months is available in lieu of military service. Men who opt for neither are sent to open prison where they may work and study for a period of six months.<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Germany</span><br>Germany has a mandatory military service of nine months for men. Women may volunteer and are allowed to perform the same jobs as men. A conscientious objector may write a petition requesting permission to do a civilian "substitute service" ("Ersatzdienst"), which is usually accepted, whereupon he is expected to serve 10 months. Overall, however, during the past few years, the number of men being drafted has declined significantly.<br><br>German law provides several options for conscientious objectors to perform alternative public service instead of a weapons-based military service:<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Greece</span><br>As of 2002, Greece (Hellenic Republic) has a mandatory military service of 18 months. However, <strong>it is developing a professional army system, and it is widely expected that the mandatory military service will be abolished soon, </strong>with some ranks serving for 14 or 16 months in recent times.

Pacifists can apply for alternative service.<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Russia</span><br>As of 2002, Russia (Russian Federation) has a mandatory two-year draft but most Russians avoid it.  Only 11 percent of Russian men enter mandatory military service.<br><br><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Singapore</span><br>Singapore has one of the <span style="text-decoration: underline;">longest mandatory military service </span>for males, at two and a half years.</strong> As of Jan 2005, it will be reduce by 6 months.

Military service for Swiss men is obligatory according to the Federal Constitution, and includes 17 weeks of basic training as well as annual 3-week-refresher courses until a number of service days which increases with rank (300 days for privates) is reached. Service for women is voluntary, but identical in all respects. Conscientous objectors can choose 450 days of community service instead of military service. Medical deferments and dismissals from basic training (often on somewhat dubious grounds) have increased significantly in the last years. Therefore, only about 33% of Swiss men actually complete basic training.<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Taiwan (ROC)</span><br>As 0f 2004, The Republic of China has implemented mandatory military service for all males since 1949. Females in the outlying islands of Fujian must also serve. Beginning January 2004, the mandatory service has been shortened by two months.<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Canada</span><br><strong>In Canada conscription has never taken place in peace-time.</strong> Conscription became an extremely controversial issue during both WWI and WWII, especially in the province of Quebec.<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">France</span><br>France was one of the first nations to employ conscription. During the wars following the French Revolution the army needed men to stop invasions Austrian and British invasions. <strong>France abolished peacetime military conscription in 2001.</strong><br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Slovenia</span><br><strong>Slovenia's Prime Minister Anton Rop abolished mandatory military service on September 9, 2003.</strong><br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">United Kingdom</span><br>The United Kingdom had conscription during the First World War and the Second World War. After the Second World War, it introduced <strong>National Service, which was abolished in 1960.</strong><br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">United States of America</span><br>The United States has instituted mandatory military service at various times, usually during wars such as the American Civil War, World War II and Vietnam War. Registration for selective service (for possible future drafts) is required of all males at their 18th birthday. Registrants remain in the pool until January 1 of the year they turn 25.<br><br>When the United States began mobilizing in 1940, in response to the threat from Nazi Germany, the first peacetime draft in its history was introduced. Use of the draft persisted through the early years of the Cold War.<br><br>However, in the aftermath of Vietnam, it was recognized that retention of conscription would be completely impracticable.<br><br><strong>The military currently does not believe that a draft is needed. They feel that the current personnel levels of the military services is sufficient.</strong> Some members of the military feel that an all volunteer military provides military services with people that are in the military because it is truly what they want to do, and makes the military better. In recent times many more positions in the military require highly skilled and trained individuals, which some in the military have felt could only be obtained through volunteer means. There have been rumours of a targeted draft to obtain the people that have specific skills for military service.<br><br><span style="color: red;"><strong>We can learn from USA , we must also admit a strong regular army is sufficient to deterent terrorists during peace time.

            <div class='col-md body'>I wonder if the SAF will form new units - perhaps revive 2 Guards along the way? - to absorb the extra 5,000 conscripts each year.<br><br>I think the operational-status rotation will definately be affected, now that qualified units will serve a half-year less than before. No wonder 2-week standbys are already in norm (as suggested in another thread).<br><br>With the new technology, are they gonna shorten the vocational courses as well? Ditto OCS - while overall tilting towards sustaining the present training-period for NS units as much as possible?<br><br>Clarencebk, I'm ex-Arty so here's my comment to your post; I dunno how utilitarian it was to other Formations, or if it's still relevant today, or whether it was different in the 1970's. But from my own experience, I've always interpreted that everything - inc. 2 or 2.5 years' conscription - is oriented around a feasible training period for operational status, which is (was?) chronologically 1.5 years for an Arty unit. That's the period when soldiers of various vocations would come together to work as an integrated whole.<br><br>Deductively, it also meant that, as they initially assemble:<br><br>- the gunners were 6-month-old soldiers, after 3 months mono-intake BMT &amp; 3 months vocational training.<br><br>- the Arty NCOs were 9-month-old soldiers, after 3 months Tekong BMT, 3 months section-leader course &amp; 3 months vocational training (when the gunners were concurrently doing BMT). They would've already been posted in to train together with the gunners during the latter's <span style="font-style: italic;">own</span> vocational training.<br><br>- the Arty officers were 12-month-old soldiers, after 3 months Tekong BMT &amp; 9 months OCS course.<br><br>- the other non-NCO appointments (TAs, signallers, etc.) were also<br>6-month-old soldiers, after 3 months Tekong BMT &amp; 3 months vocational training.<br><br>Of course, there's also "auxiliary" troops like drivers-medics-storemen-clerks, as well as regular officers/NCOs &amp; both disrupters &amp; makeupees, whose inprocessing dates can further complicate the status quo, but all in all the operational main body is formed around the 4 sub-groups above. The <span style="font-style: italic;">old</span> "problem" was that, during my time in the mid-'80s, more &amp; more of Group 4 - including myself - were A-level educated &amp; thus, with an extra half-year to serve, didn't ROD with the battalion. The unit HQ didn't have room for all of us, so we got attached to anyone who wanted us: Training Cadre, other Arty units, overseas exercises, even just the COS-needy!<br><br>But all of us did serve 1.5 years together, regardless of our subsequent fates as reservists. if the SAF is still using this chronological "formula", then IMHO they will have to make some major adjustments to the length of vocational-training &amp; possibly leadership courses as well, so that they can get the timing down on the bulk personnel arriving to train for operational status.<br><br>It's an entirely separate (logistical) matter to just possessing new-technology weapons, even as the latter can indirectly aid the efficiency of the former.<br><br>Curious: Do the other non-Arty combat formations time their forming up &amp; training schedule in the same way?<br><br>P.S. The last 6 months of the said 1.5 years was kinda "lobo" for my unit; we'd passed our proficiency test for the 2nd time &amp;, apparently, inherited the role of live-firing resource for any foot unit that wanted some realistic toppings during their SAFTI field exercises. But I remember we ultimately spent 2-3 of them months converting to our reservist artillery weapon too, so, no, it wasn't a complete waste of time.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Me &amp; my kakis used to wonder, as our ICT stints wounded down, whether the then-newly implemented 5-month BMT (or whatever) would've forced significant adjustments to training timetables for NS operational status.<br><br>Until informed otherwise, I'm assuming this status quo hadn't changed that much since my own time in the 2nd half of the '80s - &amp; that, even with the 2-year blanket conscription, the SAF continues to adhere that an NSF unit must train together for X years before they enter the reserves.<br><br>I'm speaking more from the Arty viewpoint, but my feeling is it shouldn't negatively affect the individual training for NCOs &amp; other ranks (BMT, vocational plus relevant specialist courses) all that much - the new technology can, on paper, save back up to a fortnight's duration in attendance. Of course, it'll also resolve the non-NCO, 2.5-year NS "displacement" for good.<br><br>But I foresee the present 9th-month OCS term as a possibly major obstacle to adjust around; my knowledge is the cadets' schedules have always been jam-packed, so how much time is realistically saveable so that they can be posted out earlier if possible? Presumably, they're from the same Tekong intake as the Arty NCOs but - unlike the latter - they're comparatively 3 months behind in arriving to work with the gunners. Realistically, will they be mature enough to form chemistry &amp;/or lead within a 2-year NS window, with or without a shortened OCS course?<br><br>The other probable handicap, for me, is if the NSF operational unit must switch to another system (weapon, apparatus or technology) before they ORD. If its training calendar's already reduced by 3 months from, say, 1.5 to 1.25 years to reflect the 2-year conscription, then having to additionally schedule in a conversion timetable would cut the original training cycle further, to perhaps just 1 year (for argument's sake). IMHO That'll be unfortunate; technical proficiency is one thing, but unit cooperation needs more time to gel simply cuz it's human-oriented.</div>
