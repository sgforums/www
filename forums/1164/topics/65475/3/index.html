            <div class='col-md body'>The rate of fire and range will depend mainly on the gun, calibre that is mounted on the system. The one on the RSS Endurance probably is the same as the one mounted on our Bionix, which is the Boeing Bushmaster I, 25mm caliber. So if you want to check out the specs , try the Boeing website..</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Unlikely bah. Yes, it is possible to use a surface search radar to direct a missile. But normally, this is not done because it will only limit you to a single beam to luminate the target and you will get blinded while the radar is doing the illumination.<br><br>That is why u have dedicated FCS such as STIR.

            <div class='col-md body'>The Endurance class of ships is still considered quite new and are already undergoing upgrades. This says a lot about the commitment Mindef have towards the navy. I have recently come across an article saying that besides the new Endurance class ships,Singapore also aquire one 2nd-hand LST from another navy to replace the old American WW II ones. Can anyone confirm this? Pictures are appreciated. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I agree. Actually the Endurance is really value-added. First lower manning requirements due to more automation ship for ship.

            <div class='col-md body'>A couple of questions to all in the know (and I believe it's very ok to answer  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"> ):<br><br>What is the role of the merchant marine in RSN? Ships that operate under RSN are on lease or are they owned by RSN? So if RSS Perserverance has been decommissioned and put to merchant marine, what does that mean? Sold off to a civilian operator?<br><br>Would like to understand how it works. MV Kendrick for eg, how does it work? Can RSN bring her to a 'war situation' if she doesn't own the ship?<br><br>BTW Joe Black thanks for the picture. Nice.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_surprised.gif" alt="Surprised" title="Surprised"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I think what is needed now is a type of support ship to provide support to the naval fleet for long range and duration deployments. During peace time we can use it to support our UN peace-keeping missions which i predict will increase with time. During peace time the ship can keep the fleet longer out at sea for the patrolling and guarding of SLOC(such as in the Straits of Malacca and the South China sea) and possible blockade of enemy territorial waters. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"></div>
