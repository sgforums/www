NDU, are you one of those down there?<br><br><a href="http://straitstimes.asia1.com.sg/singapore/story/0,4386,227476,00.html" rel="nofollow">http://straitstimes.asia1.com.sg/singapore/story/0,4386,227476,00.html</a><br><br><strong>Singapore forces patrol Iraqi coastline </strong><br>160 RSS Endurance crew protect the Al Basra Oil Terminal as part of S'pore's efforts to help re-build Iraq<br><br>By David Boey<br><br>ABOARD RSS ENDURANCE (In the northern Arabian Gulf) - As Singaporeans get ready to usher in the new year, the crew of the RSS Endurance is gearing up for its next mission off the coast of southern Iraq.<br><br>The RSN Task Group on board this 141m-long landing ship tank, or LST, has completed three sea deployments of 10 or 11 days each since arriving in the Gulf in November.<br><br>Over the weekend, it started its fourth mission, patrolling the Iraqi coastline. Its job is to protect a vital installation at sea, patrol sea routes leading to Iraqi ports and deter smuggling.<br><br>Part of its task is to safeguard the Al Basra Oil Terminal, or Abot, just off the Iraqi coast.<br><br>This petroleum terminal can pump about US$60 million (S$102 million) worth of crude oil a day.<br><br>Concern that terrorists may try to disrupt its operations has prompted the coalition forces to assign two warships to protect the facility every day.<br><br>These guard ships maintain a safe zone around Abot, from which they stop and turn away unauthorised ships.<br><br>As the patrol area sits astride sea lanes leading to Iraqi ports, the task group also queries and inspects merchant ships and cargo dhows sailing in these waters.<br><br>Lieutenant-Colonel Sukhvinder Singh Chopra, who commands the task group, said: 'We board and inspect ships to verify that they are not contravening United Nations Security Council regulations, for example, in the area of oil smuggling and carriage of unauthorised weapons,' he said.<br><br>When a vessel is awaiting prosecution for breaching the rules, the Republic of Singapore Navy (RSN) gives medical checks to the crew and provides water, rations and other essentials.<br><br>At the LST's rear, a helicopter deck serves as a landing platform for naval helicopters supporting the coalition's patrolling warships to land and re-fuel.<br><br>A sizeable number of Naval Diving Unit troops is on board, both to protect the task group and to search merchant vessels.<br><br>The unit's marksmen can use high-powered rifles to hit their targets precisely, while a 25mm naval gun provides greater firepower against seaborne threats several kilometres away.<br><br>RSS Endurance's presence in the Arabian Gulf is part of Singapore's contribution to the multinational effort to re-build Iraq.<br><br>Unless the Iraqi people can re-build their lives and re-integrate their country into the global community, there can be no stability in the Gulf region and the Middle East, said Singapore's Defence Minister Teo Chee Hean.<br><br>The Straits Times' visit to RSS Endurance and its 160 RSN men and women is the first time the Defence Ministry has allowed the Singapore media to witness RSN operations in the Gulf.<br><br>'The core of the crew deployed here has worked and trained together for some time. The crew was drilled in responses to small-boat threats and practised numerous drills that would prevent the spread of fire and flooding, in the event that we're engaged upon,' said Lt-Col Chopra.<br><br>During the northern winter, the sun sets at around 4.30pm and temperatures dip to as low as 10 deg C. Strong gusty winds whip up waves 2.5m high.<br><br>Winter operations here make it a real challenge when fast boats need to be launched to investigate other vessels.<br><br>RSS Endurance's commanding officer, Lt-Col Li Lit Siew, said his crew has coped well so far and their morale remains high despite the fast tempo of the operations.<br><br>Lt-Col Chopra said: 'Our task - in particular the protection of our ship, protection of the oil terminal, boarding, and health and comfort checks - is challenging and demanding, both physically and mentally.<br><br>'The crew has had to maintain round-the-clock vigilance against threats, performed in very cold wind chill as well as rough sea conditions common during winter in the northern Arabian Gulf.<br><br>'This demands the highest level of professionalism. They have shown tremendous dedication.'</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Very happy and proud to see Singaporeans and their tax money contributing directly to World Peace!!! We should have much more of this.<br><br>RSS Endurance is now operating as a Sea Control Ship? Well it's the perfect machine for the job. From what I saw on the news, it's looking somewhat exposed to terrorist attack though. Would have been better if they have a Fearless PV as company......<br><br>What's the 25mm gun mentioned in the news article? I can only recall 50 cal MGs and Mistral Simbad launcher.<br><br>This mission should see if their 65 crew manning is correct though I guess it must be proven in their round the world voyage.<br><br>Well good luck to LTC Chopra! He is probably the most experienced officer in RSN.......<br><br>Has Japan contributed any naval asset to OIF? I think RSN is the only one in Asia? If so, then we have one more big reason to be proud Singaporeans!<br><br>Wished they had better pics though?

I think it's prudent that we all not compromise the safety of the ship's company.<br><br>Even the Typhoon gun... I had to bargain for that one. That's why I could only use "25mm gun" in the first article and some of you thought I actually meant the 76mm A gun.<br><br>I somewhat suspect that anyone attempting a Tamil Tiger-style mass suicide boat attack will be in for some rather nasty surprises and will get to meet their god quickly.<br><br>All I can say is the ship is ringed with many, many weapons (typical KS Singaporeans  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"> ) and the ship has more MGs than you have fingers and toes. If you're not careful, you could trip over one while strolling on deck.<br><br>While I agree with some (only some, not all) of the sentiments expressed in the thread on Network Centric Warfare (i.e. IKC2) and the concerns in the discussion on Courageous, I think the Navy seems to have staffed and armed 207 properly this time.<br><br>Pity, can't tell the full story now.
