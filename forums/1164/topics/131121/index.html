Do you want to re-sign and extend your contract or apply for French citizenship? A common occurrence faced by many Legionnaires is being suddenly informed of a backlog of taxes.<br><br>Your last week in the Legion is spent in Aubagne completing the final clearance phase of departure. You'll undergo a final medical exam, have your identity re-established if you had your name changed and was not yet changed back, and be given paperwork as proof of your passage through the Legion. A free train ticket to anywhere in France will be issued to you. On the final day there is a small ceremony for those leaving and everyone is addressed by the Commandant of the Legion. The Commandant is a general in charge of the entire Legion.</div>

Their 'BMT' involves you doing a 50km route march and i've read that all FFls need to complete a route march of more than 120 km!<br><br>Also, Coporal punuishment is still prevalent in the FFL and there are high rates of suicide and desertion. Lastly, joining is not as easy as it used to be. I've read that chances of passing the selection are about 1/15. And you have ex-Royal marines commandos gg for the selection. !<br><br>The us army.... the IRaq war has made me lose a lot of respect of the us army. Look at Lyndie (?) England. She has learning disabilities and she still got in?!!?<br><br>I do not want to serve with c unts and knobs like that. They are likely to get me killed.<br><br>Sigh - too bad i do not think i am up to it. I have the greatest admiration for the ppl in the FFL and i think they are the epitome of soldiering.</div>

The SAS lads and Green Berets I've known over the years are bad and tough.  With the possible exception of 2ReP, FFL are generally a mob of hooligans.
