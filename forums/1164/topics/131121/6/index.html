For the 5 years i am in, the legion will be my family, and my life will revolve around the legion. The Legion also promises ample opportunity to go on OPs, and imo, it is a great way to start a military career.<br><br>I am also a hopeless romantic.<br><br>But like i said, i have already dropped the idea. Nevertheless, i started this thread so that we can have a meaningful discussion on one of the most fascinating armies in the world today. Let's keep it a meaningful discussion and not start any e-cock waving.<br><br>Btw, I do not think much blame can be imputed to the Legion for those losses. The fact is France has lost most of its campaign.
