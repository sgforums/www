            <div class='col-md body'>*sigh*<br><br>The situation is simple.  tvdog said he didn't believe that I was a Commando, and hey, that's fair enough - he doesn't know me, does he?<br><br>But what happens when Heng and LazerLordz speak up to set things straight?  He calls Heng my dog.<br><br>Even after I've posted a photo of my reservist booklet, tvdog keeps crapping on, going off on tangents of man-to-man meetings (maybe that's a code for the way he swings, and if so, no thanks - he's not my sort <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"> ) and asking me to go to PM.  PM?  What for?  So he can whisper sweet nothings to me?<br><br>Like I said, there's nothing I wouldn't say on PM that I wouldn't say in public.  If he wants to go PM, he's the chickensh*t who's got something to hide.<br><br>He challenged me for proof, I've provided it, there are people here who know me personally and know that I am who I say I am.  Sure, I could get a couple of 2 Coy guys to turn up and tell him that I am indeed a Commando, but if tvdog already rejects the evidence in front of him, what interest would he have in meeting my former company mates?<br><br>But he still wants to meet.  Why?<br><br>Does he want to fight?  Hell, I'd be embarrassed to give him the caning he so richly deserves - I don't pick on smaller guys and making him cry would only make me look bad.<br><br>And if it's not that, my skin crawls to think what his intentions are - his talk about boyfriends has me genuinely concerned.  Like I said, my door don't swing that way, if you know what I mean. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>oie tvdog . . .you want to f**k around with the mods for breaking the forum rules on no flaming too?<br><br>I dunno and i dun care about whatever grieviences between you and ged. But i suggest that you tone down and continue to go on with the discussion.<br>If  not, you can jolly well leave this discussion and sulk in the corner.<br><br>This is not your grandfather's forums. People are free to air their views and talk. If you can't even tolerate that, then don't talk. No need for name calling or whatever ok?<br><br>If you want people to respect you, you gotta learn to respect others for who they are. Otherwise you think anybody is going to give a damn about your beheavior here? The only thing you will ever achieve is to annoy one big bunch of people who come here hoping for a good discussion to wind down after a hard day's work.<br><br>I rest my case here. Any furthur flaming post will be edited. People, i apologise for not being here earlier.</div>

UPDATE: On October 12, 2000 the Legion was ordered to accept women into its ranks. FURTHER UPDATE: According to a statement by Legion spokesman Lt. Col. Yann Peron, the announcement that women would be allowed to join was due to a "miscommunication." Changes that will allow women to serve in almost every function in the French Army would not apply to the Legion, although female officers may be able to transfer from military schools. An article concerning this development appeared in the November 5, 2000 edition of the New York Times.<br>* You don't need to be able to speak French when you enlist but it is a good idea to learn as much as you can beforehand. It will be necessary to speak it in order to do your job.<br>* You will need a valid passport and possibly a visa to enter France. You must enter France at your own expense. You are not reimbursed if they don't accept you.<br>* Think about preparing a last will and testament.<br>* You can't have a bank account in France. The Legion maintains an account for you and you can arrange to transfer money anywhere in the world.<br>* A criminal history may be overlooked if the offenses are minor but there are no guarantees.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hi guys, just want to add that the FFL no longer takes in people with any criminal records or are on the run from the law from which ever country concern.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br><br>As for the question about the Singapore military would consider you a traitor? Well, once you're in the FFL, you're expected to go to war with which ever country that the French government decides on &amp; that might include Singapore, so you must ask yourself when the time comes, who're you going to fight for.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>In the U.S military, they do not immediately give you a citizernship upon enlisting.  Instead you're suppose to apply for citizernship through the Immigration office but being in the military would indeed ensure that you get a U.S citizernship especially if you're being deploy to Iraq or Astan.  Of course, your service record must also show that you've been a good soldier.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br><br>As for the question as to whether FFL soldiers are good enough, well, not all of them are French.  Even though the FFL are made up of foreginers, the ratio of Frenchmen to foreginers are 2:4.  Some years back it was decided by the Frenh military &amp; government that if the FFL was made up of all foreginers then it stands at a risk that 1 day these FFL might turn against the French government.  Most of the officers &amp; senior NCOs in the FFL are, therefore, made up of Frenchmen. So if you've got any intend on being an officer or NCO in the FFL, you've got to speak French &amp; be outstanding enough.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_neutral.gif" alt="Neutral" title="Neutral"><br><br>Current make up of FFL include former soldiers from; USMC, Brits SAS, Brits Gurkhas, S.African Scouts, German soldiers, etc.  Of course, there are those who have no military background but decided to join the FFL.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_eek.gif" alt="Shocked" title="Shocked"><br><br>Are the FFL soldiers any goo?  Well, it depends on the individual soldier &amp; also where they are fighting in.  I would say that so far in the 1st gulf war &amp; the Astan war, the FFL have been fighting well.  As for the minor wars under the U.N, they'ven't been doing that well.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_confused.gif" alt="Confused" title="Confused"></div>
