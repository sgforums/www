Judging by the posts, it's based on a few scraps of information about SOF that have been printed in the local papers.

The only one that i can remember of is one which involved SOF in that hijacked plane at Changi airport, but wait that's not even real action that i'd consider, coz the terrorists on that SQ flight were poorly armed.
