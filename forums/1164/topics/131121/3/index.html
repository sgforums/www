Please confirm or clarify.<br><br>Can't help with bringing Heng along, I'm afraid - he's currently studying in England, a fact you would know if you've been reading the forum for the past year or so.<br><br>As for the rest of the guys, well, I'll give you this chance to rephrase.  They'll be seeing this thread to get up to speed with what's going on, so if they decide to take offense to what you just wrote, it's out of my hands.  If they choose to express their displeasure, it's between you and them, and you'll have started it with that loose keyboard of yours.<br><br>Just so we're clear, I'm not making any threats here.  I'm just pointing out that what you've written could create a situation that is detrimental to you and recommending some changes, so there's no need to get up in a pucker here.<br><br>I don't think you're too bright, by the way.  I've offered to bring documentation to support my claims, but you're looking to ask people whom you don't know for testimony instead?  Ah well, if that's the way you want it, fine - I've got more solid evidence, but if that's all it takes to satisfy you it's no skin off my nose.  Just be prepared to make your announcement on the forum that you're wrong.<br><br>Now, can I have any volunteers to come along and watch this meeting take place?  Let's get some witnesses here.</div>

Sure I can take it however I want to, but I asked you what YOU mean, and now you're trying to wriggle your way out of it.<br><br>Come on, it's a simple enough question - who did you refer to as my "boyfriends"?
