The deal is said to be worth more than US$1 billion (S$1.75 billion).<br><br>Advertisement<br><br>The other two candidates are the Boeing F-15T Strike Eagle from the United States, and the Typhoon, offered by a consortium of aircraft makers from Britain, Germany, Italy and Spain.<br><br>In an interview, the French Ministry of Defence's strategic affairs director Marc Perrin de Brichambaut said: 'It's true that if you get involved in the Rafale, the development of the new radar is to be done jointly.'<br><br>He was referring to the advanced RBE-2 radar found on the fighter.<br><br>Other incentives would include greater access to air force training areas in France, added the policymaker who is one of the French defence ministry's top civil servants.<br><br>If Mindef goes for the Rafale, it will come after the order for six stealth frigates from French shipyard, Direction des Constructions Navales International (DCN), in early 2000 under a multi-billion-dollar order.<br><br>The first 110m-long frigate is now in an advanced stage of construction at a DCN yard in Lorient, in north-west France. It is expected to arrive in Singapore in 2005.<br><br>Five others are being built by local shipyard, Singapore Technologies Marine, in Jurong.<br><br>Defence engineers from France and Singapore are now working on integrating the different weapon systems on board the frigate.<br><br>The stealth warships will be armed with guns, anti-ship and anti-aircraft missiles. Each ship will also carry a naval helicopter tasked with hunting and destroying submarines.<br><br>Said Mr de Brichambaut: 'Since you are clever buyers of defence equipment, you have tended to pick and choose the best equipment on these frigates. Most of that equipment has not been integrated before on a project of this scale.'<br><br>Because of the complexity of the project, the engineers will have to overcome some technical challenges, he added.<br><br>Aside from cooperation on the frigate, defence engineers from both countries have also worked together on radar technology, chemical and biological defence and underwater technologies.<br><br>Both countries are developing a new 'legal and procedural framework' to protect sensitive weapons technology developed jointly, said Mr de Brichambaut.<br><br>'Our defence relations are entering a new phase where we will actually share work in long-term cooperation projects, and this needs to be built in an environment of legal and other considerations.'<br><br>French defence officials and policy advisers also value the intelligence exchanges with Singapore, as it helps them understand the security situation in South-east Asia, which aids in their counter-terrorism planning, he added.<br><br>'Because of your geographical location, you are hugely aware of developments on a broad scale in South-east Asia and we would like to hear Singapore's point of view on regional developments,' said Mr de Brichambaut.<br><br>The planned visit this month by Dr Tony Tan, Deputy Prime Minister and Coordinating Minister for Security and Defence, is expected to deepen counter-terrorism cooperation with France.<br><br></blockquote><span style="color: blue;"><br>Wow, France is desparate to make the first Rafale sales. Perhaps Singapore could really position itself to make the best deal here - cheaper plane and technology transfers.<br><br>I would love to see India and Taiwan buy a few squadrons too, just to toss the military balance up  a bit ... hee hee... but of course, this will only happen in my dreams...  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br></span></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Well , if we're getting the Rafale , we might be dependent on France for spare parts . But , the technology transfer would really be nice to have cos maybe we could improve on it and upgrade our own plane's radar in the future . Just curious , is the Rafale able to carry the conventional bombs and missiles or can it just carry french made weapons ?</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>If you guys noticed, it seems that the 'advanced radar' refers to the next-gen upgrade of the RBE-2, which would be an active-array type. However, if I remember correctly, France has already commited to joint-development of the AMSAR radar, which is slated to be the replacement of both the current RBE-2 and the ECR-90. So... if the AMSAR is already the replacement, (we'd have no role in the AMSAR, as that is already set as an European collabaration), then why the RBE-2 upgrade? (which would most likely not be fitted onto their own Rafales?)</div>

However, if I remember correctly, France has already commited to joint-development of the AMSAR radar, which is slated to be the replacement of both the current RBE-2 and the ECR-90. So... if the AMSAR is already the replacement, (we'd have no role in the AMSAR, as that is already set as an European collabaration), then why the RBE-2 upgrade? (which would most likely not be fitted onto their own Rafales?)</div></blockquote>guess it's something expedient...just to sweeten the deal. No doubt our evaluation team will take a hard look at this offer and see if it's really something worthwhile...or maybe just a diet coke version of the real thing</div>

The aircraft are the Eurofighter Typhoon, French Dassault Rafale and the United States' F-15E Strike Eagle.<br><br>There may be flying displays too, said Mr Ed Ng, who is president of Asian Aerospace as well as Reed Exhibitions, which is managing the air show. The line-up of events and participants is still being finalised, he said yesterday, giving a first peek at what visitors can expect at the biennial event, which will be held from Feb 24 to 29. It is open to the public only on the last two days.<br><br>The organisers expect Mindef's top choices to be 'one of the biggest highlights of the show', said Asian Aerospace vice-president Trixie Webster. The three were shortlisted from among six aircraft in a tender to replace the Republic of Singapore Air Force's (RSAF) ageing A-4SU Super Skyhawk fighter-bombers.<br><br>Mr Ng is confident that next year's show will be as big as, if not bigger than, last year's, when more than 62,000 people came. They included 22,000 trade visitors from 65 countries.<br><br>Next year's event will also see an aviation summit held alongside it, a first tie-up between Asian Aerospace and the International Air Transport Association (Iata). Said Iata's regional vice-president Andrew Drysdale: 'The summit will give us a platform to focus on the important issues facing our industry alongside our partners, not just the airlines, but all the partners in the industry.'<br><br>Iata's two-day conference is expected to draw more than 100 top guns to discuss the future of the regional aviation industry which has been battered by terrorism, war and the Sars crisis.<br><br></div>

I personally think that it is time to get a new plane from Europe - at least different supply chain and possibly less politicial string attached.<br><br></div>
