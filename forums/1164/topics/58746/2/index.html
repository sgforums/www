"Tranche Two is about what capability goes on those aircraft and when you start building them."<br><br>A deal must be struck by early 2004 to avoid costly disruptions in production at the four final assembly sites.<br><br>The jets cost from $45 million to $65 million and high-volume production is key to keeping costs down.<br><br>Upgrades in the second tranche are expected to include better missiles, including the Meteor beyond visual range air-to-air missile built by a European consortium led by MBDA.<br><br>-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="Arrow" title="Arrow"> somehow i have a feeling that this is <span style="font-style: italic;">the</span> one<br></div>

The latest variant of the APG-63 will be configured with new transmit/receive modules and countermeasures suite, and be air-to-ground capable.  The radar could be delivered in late 2007, the original Singapore service-entry target, although this depends on development funding for a planned upgrade to the version being retrofitted to the US Air Force F-15Cs.<br><br>Final assembly of the first of 40 F-15Ks for th eSouth Korea begins in May 2004, with first flight in March 2005 and delivery of the first two fighters dus the following November.  FInal deliveries of the aircraft ordered under the original $3.6 billion contract are due in August 2008, although South Korea is expected to begin its budget request for "additional high-end fighters" in 2004, says Winker, its original requirement was for 120 aircraft.<br><br>New weapons on the F-15 include the AGM-84 Harpoon and SLAM-ER missiles and the 500lb (225kg) JDAM GPS guided bomb.  The South Korean aircraft will also be the first production F-15 powered by the General Electric F110-129 engine, and will be equipped with the AIM-9X missile and the Lockheed Martin Tiger Eyes targeting , navigating and infrared search and track pod.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Found this report about F15 in<br>http://www.fas.org/man/dod-101/sys/ac/f-15.htm<br><br>F15 may not be that impressive after all.<br><br>The US Air Force claims the F-15C is in several respects inferior to, or at best equal to, the MiG-29, Su-27, Su-35/37, Rafale, and EF-2000, which are variously superior in acceleration, maneuverability, engine thrust, rate of climb, avionics, firepower, radar signature, or range. Although the F-15C and Su-27P series are similar in many categories, the Su-27 can outperform the F-15C at both long and short ranges. In long-range encounters, with its superiorr radar the Su-27 can launch a missile before the F-15C does, so from a purely kinematic standpoint, the Russian fighters outperform the F-15C in the beyond-visual-range fight. The Su-35 phased array radar is superior to the APG-63 Doppler radar in both detection range and tracking capabilities. Additionally, the Su-35 propulsion system increases the aircraftÂ’s maneuverability with thrust vectoring nozzles. Simulations conducted by British Aerospace and the British Defense Research Agency compared the effectiveness of the F-15C, Rafale, EF-2000, and F-22 against the Russian Su-35 armed with active radar missiles similar to the AIM-120 Advanced Medium Range Air-to-Air Missile (AMRAAM). The Rafale achieved a 1:1 kill ratio (1 Su-35 destroyed for each Rafale lost). The EF-2000 kill ratio was 4.5:1 while the F-22 achieved a ratio of 10:1. In stark contrast was the F-15C, losing 1.3 Eagles for each Su-35 destroyed.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>JDW 15 October 2003<br><br>Singapore shortlist fighter bids<br>Craig Hoyle/ JDW Aviation EditorLondon<br><br>Singapore 's Defense Science and Technology Agency shortlisted three bidders on 10 October for the final phase of a competition to equip its air force up to 24 new fighters aircraft from late this decade.<br><br>Hinting at a possible departure from its traditional procurement of strike aircraft produced by US manufacturers, the country has identified two European suppliers and just on US proposal as having the potential to meet its future requirements.<br><br>The competition has been reduced to include US Boeing F-15T, the Rafale offered by French team comprising Dassualt Aviation, Snecma and Thales; and the Typhoon manufactured by the four-nation Eurofighter consortium.  Boeing F/A-18E/F Super Hornet;  Lockheed Martin F-16 Block 60; and Sukhoi Su-30MK were eliminated from the running.<br><br>The Reupblic of Singapore Air FOrce (RSAF) requirements is for an initial squadron of 8 aircraft, with an additional 12-16 fighters to be procured later.  "We expect to take delivery of our first aircraft in 2008-09," said MInistry of National Defense (MINDEF) spokeperson on 10 October.  The new type will replace the air force's ageing fleet of A-4SU Skyhawk attack aircraft, around 40 of which remain in squadron service.<br><br>"The final [platform] selection will most probably be made in late 2004 or 2005," said the MINDEF source, noting that "the exact timing will depend on the evalution process".  This scehdule shows a marked slow-down from earlier proposals, which sought a contract announcement late this year and first aircraft deliveries during 2006-2007 (JDW 6 March 2003).  Exact details of RSAF contract - including final numbers and cost - will become clear following release of invitations to tender around mid-November.<br><br>Boeing's F-15T is a further development of the US Air Force's F-15E and the derivative F-15K, which was selected by the Republic of Korea Air FOrce last year to meet a 40-aircaft requirement.  The aircraft is the heaviest under consideration; its maximum takeorr weight of almost 37,000kg is about 14,000kg greater than either European platform.  Boeing officials hope to build on F-15's recent success in South Korea, where it saw off competition from both the Rafale and Typhoon designs.<br><br>French industry, meanwhile, hopes to secure its first export success for th eRaflae, which lost out to the F-15K in thefinal phase of Seoul's approximately $4.5 billion F-X fighter competition contest.  The Dassualt-lead team is believied to be promoting its Rafale mk2 in Signapore , which features more powerfull engines and enhanced avionics equipment, although Dassualt declined to confirm this a s JDW went to press.<br><br>Eurofighter officials are looking to expand Typhoon's export book, following the singapore seater's recent success in securing an Austrian order for 18 aircraft.<br><br>Singapore competition also includes requirmeents f ro extensive technology transfer and could request the oversea deployment  of one squadron of aircraft to assist in training activites.  The RSAF already maintains Skyhawks and F-16 detachments in France and US, respectively, and bid leader BAE Systems has offered Singapore the opportunity to operate Typhoons in the UK.<br><br>Although its elimination from the contest will come as a blow to LOckheed Martin, which has been contracted supply the RSAF with 58 F-16 since the late 1980s, the company could benefit in the longer term through Signapore;s interest in th eF-35 Joint Striek Fighter (JSF). Singaproe  is security co-operation participants in the Lockheed MArtin-led JSF project, following its $50 million commitment to the programme's system devlopment and demonstration phase earlier this year(JDW 5 March)</div>
