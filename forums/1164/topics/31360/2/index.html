It's absolutely wrong, says the Republic<br><br>By Brendan Pereira<br>MALAYSIA CORRESPONDENT<br><br>THE small lighthouse island of Pedra Branca to the east of Singapore has once again become a flashpoint between the Republic and Malaysia.<br><br>After a week of threats and accusations from across the Causeway, Singapore responded yesterday.<br><br>Calling the recent allegations reported in the Malaysian media 'wild and irresponsible', a Foreign Ministry spokesman said they were 'wrong both in fact and law'.<br><br>He not only debunked the various Malaysian claims but also noted that it was Singapore that had first proposed to refer the issue to the International Court of Justice (ICJ), and that was 13 years ago.<br><br>This is contrary, he said, to recent Malaysian allegations that Singapore was holding up the signing of a Special Agreement that would allow this to take place.<br><br>He said: 'It was Singapore which first proposed to Malaysia in 1989 that Malaysia's claim to Pedra Branca should be referred to the International Court of Justice for resolution. That has always been our position and we stand ready to sign the Special Agreement, to which both sides have agreed, to bring the dispute to the ICJ.'<br><br>Asked when Singapore would be ready to sign it, a senior official said: 'Any time.'<br><br>Malaysia proposed on Nov 2 that this agreement be signed at the next water talks, but on Nov 29, it called off the talks, saying it wanted to go directly to arbitration.<br><br>Singapore has exercised sovereignty over Pedra Branca since the 1840s, when the British colonial government built Horsburgh Lighthouse on the island, to ensure the safety of passing ships.<br><br>Singapore has continued to maintain the lighthouse and other facilities needed for navigation.<br><br>Malaysia first staked a claim to the island it calls Pulau Batu Putih in 1979, when it published a map of its territorial waters that included the island. It claims the Johor Sultanate has exercised complete jurisdiction and sovereignty over it since 1513.<br><br>Since 1979, there have been several incidents at sea, when Malaysian vessels were prevented from approaching the island by Singapore naval vessels patrolling the waters.<br><br>The latest took place on Dec 24, when a Republic of Singapore Navy vessel ordered a Malaysian marine police boat to leave the area. The Malaysian boat was ferrying journalists to the site.<br><br>The Malaysian media have been playing up the issue for a week since the ICJ ruled in Malaysia's favour in a separate dispute with Indonesia over the Sipadan and Ligatan islands, off the north-east coast of Borneo. Last Sunday, to beef up the Malaysian claim, the Mingguan Malaysia newspaper published on its front page a picture of what it claimed were new structures that Singapore was building on the island.<br><br>Yesterday, the MFA's spokesman set the record straight, pointing out that the last things built there were a radar facility in 1989, and a helipad in 1991 'to aid in the safety of navigation in and out of the Straits of Singapore'.<br><br>The Malaysian accusations reflected 'either a lack of understanding or misrepresentation of international law', said the spokesman.<br><br>'The dispute over Pedra Branca arose in 1979 when Malaysia for the first time contested Singapore's ownership and sovereignty. It is a well-established principle in international law that acts done by the disputing parties in an attempt to advance their own case after the dispute has already arisen will not be given credence,' he said.<br><br>He noted that Indonesia had complained to the ICJ about Malaysia's continued activities on Sipadan while the dispute was still before the court.<br><br>Malaysia had continued to promote the island, which is among the top diving spots in the world, as one of its tourist destinations.<br><br>Malaysia responded that it had done nothing wrong as it was merely continuing actions it had undertaken before the dispute arose.<br><br>'Singapore's activities on Pedra Branca are no different in law from Malaysia's actions on Sipadan,' the MFA's spokesman said.<br><br>Yesterday, Malaysian Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad rejected a politician's call to consider having a military presence near the island. Malaysia, he told reporters, will not station troops or warships in the waters off the island.<br><br>He said: 'We want to avoid confrontation. We do not want to go to war with anyone. It is not that we are giving up, we just do not want to find a reason to go to war.'<br><br>SEVERAL INCIDENTS<br><br>THERE have been several incidents at sea since 1979, when Malaysia staked a claim to the island. Malaysian vessels were prevented from approaching the island by Singapore naval vessels patrolling the waters.<br><br>The latest incident took place on Dec 24, when a Republic of Singapore Navy vessel ordered a Malaysian marine police boat to leave the area. The Malaysian boat was ferrying journalists to the site.<br><br>A Malaysian paper last Sunday published on its front page a picture of what it claimed were new structures that Singapore was building on the island.<br><br>Yesterday, a Singapore Ministry of Foreign Affairs spokesman set the record straight, pointing out that the Republic had not built anything on Pedra Branca for over 10 years.<br><br>SINGAPORE'S VIEW<br><br>Ready to sign<br><br>'It was Singapore which first proposed to Malaysia in 1989 that Malaysia's claim to Pedra Branca should be referred to the International Court of Justice (ICJ) for resolution. That has always been our position and we stand ready to sign the Special Agreement, to which both sides have agreed, to bring the dispute to the ICJ.'<br>-- A spokesman from Singapore's Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MFA)<br><br>Malaysia continued projects on Sipadan<br><br>'Malaysia claims that in the Sipadan and Ligitan dispute with Indonesia, Malaysia stopped all the projects on the disputed islands until the dispute was resolved. This is untrue. Indonesia in fact complained to the ICJ about the continued activities by Malaysia on Sipadan. Malaysia rejected these objections and their counsel's argument in the ICJ was that what they did was not wrong because these were merely the continuation of actions they had undertaken before the dispute arose. Singapore's activities on Pedra Branca are no different in law from Malaysia's actions on Sipadan.'<br>-- An MFA spokesman<br><br>MALAYSIA'S VIEW<br><br>Singapore to blame<br><br>'But although Singapore agreed in 1998, they have yet to come up with the necessary documentation to support their claim, and owing to this, the dispute cannot be solved through the International Court of Justice yet... Pulau Batu Putih is important to us because it is our territory. We don't take into consideration whether it is a source of oil or whatever.'<br>-- Malaysian Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad at a press conference on Dec 25. He was referring to the two countries' agreement in 1998 on the procedure to refer the matter to the ICJ<br><br>Location on its side<br><br>'Our arguments are solid, whether in terms of history, management and administration or location of the island, which lies within Malaysian waters.'<br>-- Johor Mentri Besar Abdul Ghani Othman<br><br><a href="http://straitstimes.asia1.com.sg/topstories/story/0,4386,162825,00.html" rel="nofollow">http://straitstimes.asia1.com.sg/topstories/story/0,4386,162825,00.html</a></div>

And we didn't make a fuss over the matter," he said.<br><br>Dr Mahathir said that the water supply issue also caused problems in bilateral relations.<br><br>The Prime Minister said that Singapore had always been asking for the volume of water supplied to the republic to be increased and Malaysia had promised to meet their request by taking into account the increasing population in the neighbouring country.<br><br>"But they objected to a review of the payment even though it has been agreed that after 25 years, we could negotiate the price of water. After 25 years, not on reaching 25 years," he said.<br><br>Dr Mahathir said that Singapore however contended that it was now too late to negotiate the matter.<br><br>"And there are many other actions by Singapore which do not help in preserving ties with Malaysia, including differentiating between Malaysians in the peninsula and those from Sabah and Sarawak over the Central Provident Fund pensions issue," he said.<br><br>In recent days, the two neighbours are embroiled in a dispute over the rightful ownership of Pulau Batu Puteh, a rocky outcrop located 7.7 nautical miles off Johor.<br><br>According to news reports yesterday, Singapore is prepared to ratify the special agreement with Malaysia to pave the way for the dispute to be brought before the International Court of Justice in The Hague.<br><br>Dr Mahathir was also asked to comment on the stance of the United States which appeared to be reluctant to learn from the events of Sept 11 and declined to identify the root causes of terrorism.<br><br>"We're very sad because now that the various parties have expressed the importance of the causes of terrorism to be tackled and eliminated, it appears that the approach adopted is still in building up the military, defence," he said.<br><br>The United States, he said, also acted in attacking a country which so far had not been known to be involved in the Sept 11 attacks on New York and Washington, which claimed 3,000 lives.<br><br>"All this will only increase anger that will lead to more acts of terrorism," he said.<br><br>-- BERNAMA<br></blockquote><a href="http://www.bernama.com.my/B2002/news.shtml?general/ge3012_3" rel="nofollow">http://www.bernama.com.my/B2002/news.shtml?general/ge3012_3</a></div>

But Dr Mahathir on Monday blamed Singapore for threatening their otherwise good relations. - AP<br></blockquote><a href="http://business-times.asia1.com.sg/news/story/0,2276,68297,00.html?" rel="nofollow">http://business-times.asia1.com.sg/news/story/0,2276,68297,00.html?</a><br><br>One thing I don't really understand....is that Dr. M, and now their foreign minister likes to use the "W" word. The foreign minister should know better....obviously not. I dunno who is not following international norms.<br><br>They claim to be "neighbourly"....but one does ponder...do one beat the war drum , if they are so friendly as they claimed?  We ought to be thankful enough, that those words remain as words....due to a strong &amp; credible SAF. I don't want to see a Kuwait 2  happen.<br><br>Their poking noses into our internal affairs...their "big brother" attitude. To me, it seems more of a bully / thug attiude. Some across the border hoped to see SG go back to Malaysia fold....it's hard to say what will happen in the future, but it should be on equal terms.<br><br>The politicians, and their youth wings like to use SG as bogey man, for their political gain. They shoot their mouth off...without bothering to check the facts. Based on current outburst from those youth group leaders.....if they ever rise to positions of power...it's not gonna get better.<br><br>On the other side of the coin, is their economy or internal problems so bad....until they have to deploy such ploys to distract their citizens?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_sad.gif" alt="Sad" title="Sad"><br><br>Strangely....their no.2  man, stated to take over Dr M....has been real silent. It will be interesting to see his response...and it will fortell the direction the relation takes in the future.<br><br>Just my 4 cents...(GST increase  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"> )</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>there could be in-fighting amongst the msian cabinet, a cabinet should in all sense function and talk like one, but the behaviour of their ministers do not seems that they have a collective and a single thought. the ministers might be joslting for power before the hand over, it is better to reinforced their power base now, who knows what badawi will do after he has taken over the pm ship....and who knows, it is hamid himself who is sending a strong message across to badawi.......</div>
