He said Singapore should not handle the matter lightly.<br><br>On Prime Minister Datuk Seri Dr Mahathir MohamadÂ’s statement that Malaysia would fight back hard against foreign governments which wanted to use the country to launch pre-emptive or forward defence, Syed Hamid said the statement reflected MalaysiaÂ’s firm stand that it would not allow any power to violate Malaysia.<br><br>He said Asean had been a stable region with good relationships among member countries and the Government would continue to maintain the relationship and respect the sovereignty of other neighbouring countries.<br><br>Meanwhile in Muar, Johor police have advised the public, including members of political organisations and associations, not to take unnecessary risks by going to the disputed Pulau Batu Putih off Pengerang to support MalaysiaÂ’s claim over the atoll.<br><br>Johor police chief Deputy Comm Datuk Mukhtar Ismail said police respected their patriotic spirit and good intentions, but their venturing into the open seas in fishing trawlers posed many dangers.<br><br><a href="http://www.thestar.com.my/news/story.asp?file=/2003/1/3/nation/ktbantah&amp;sec=nation" rel="nofollow">http://www.thestar.com.my/news/story.asp?file=/2003/1/3/nation/ktbantah&amp;sec=nation</a></div>

UN peacekeepers were stationed there after anti-independence militia launched a bloody rampage through the former Indonesian province in 1999.<br><br>Timor gained independence last May, and is now rebuilding itself.<br><br>Singapore has deployed about 250 troopers there, including 160 ground troops and a detachment of four UH-1H helicopters with 72 crew including pilots, aircrew and technicians.<br><br>The minister said he was 'heartened' to find out that morale among the Singaporeans there was high, and that they have been warmly received by the peacekeepers from other countries as well as the Timorese.<br><br>In Dili, Dr Tan also met Timor Leste Prime Minister Mari Alkatiri, Secretary of State for Defence Roque Rodrigues and the UN Special Representative of the Secretary-General, Mr Kamalesh Sharma.<br><br><a href="http://straitstimes.asia1.com.sg/latest/story/0,4390,167684,00.html?" rel="nofollow">http://straitstimes.asia1.com.sg/latest/story/0,4390,167684,00.html?</a></div>

UN peacekeepers were stationed there after anti-independence militia launched a bloody rampage through the former Indonesian province in 1999.<br><br>Timor gained independence last May, and is now rebuilding itself.<br><br>Singapore has deployed about 250 troopers there, including 160 ground troops and a detachment of four UH-1H helicopters with 72 crew including pilots, aircrew and technicians.<br><br>The minister said he was 'heartened' to find out that morale among the Singaporeans there was high, and that they have been warmly received by the peacekeepers from other countries as well as the Timorese.<br><br>In Dili, Dr Tan also met Timor Leste Prime Minister Mari Alkatiri, Secretary of State for Defence Roque Rodrigues and the UN Special Representative of the Secretary-General, Mr Kamalesh Sharma.<br><br><a href="http://straitstimes.asia1.com.sg/latest/story/0,4390,167684,00.html?" rel="nofollow">http://straitstimes.asia1.com.sg/latest/story/0,4390,167684,00.html?</a>[/b]</blockquote></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Strange, to think we've been apparently "violating" their waters since the RSN was set up... typical of Malaysian policy, redrawing the lines wherever they want. Not surprised if Singapore was weak enough, they'll close one eye and absorb us... not gonna happen on my watch though.<br><br>On the under hand, Malaysia under Singapore rule is a lot better for the people of that country... Unfortunately they'll never allow a better standard of living and logic get in the way of their ego, chosing instead to grasp for flawed policies that only prosper them in the short run and then fail them badly later, after which they turn their shame and anger at their failure to Singapore.</div>

There were five more violations last week.<br><br>'In these incidents, the Malaysian vessels came close to Pedra Branca and conducted various activities,' he said, pledging that Singapore's navy would defend the country's sovereignty.<br><br>During a visit to Singapore troops stationed Timor Leste for a United Nations peacekeeping mission on Wednesday, he repeated his warning to Kuala Lumpur about staying away from the island.<br><br>The two countries have agreed to sign a pact to refer the dispute over the rocky outcrop on their maritime border to the ICJ on Feb 6. -- AFP<br><br><a href="http://straitstimes.asia1.com.sg/latest/story/0,4390,167895,00.html?" rel="nofollow">http://straitstimes.asia1.com.sg/latest/story/0,4390,167895,00.html?</a></div>
