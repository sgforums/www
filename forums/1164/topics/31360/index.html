Are they gonna ask all their people to vacate malaysia by jumping into the sea and wait until the ICJ make a final decision??<br><br>As far as singapore is concern.. that island is ours... just because malaysia make a claim of it...

            <div class='col-md body'>found this interesting part in one of the attached articles in the pedra branca report...<br><br><strong>On water supply to Singapore, Dr Mahathir said Malaysia would not cut water supply to the republic but the supply now will only be for drinking and bathing purposes.<br><br>"We don't feel that we should supply water for their purpose of selling it to ships in order to make more money.<br><br>"We know according to the rates they publish that they sell water to ships at at the rate of S$20 per 1,000 gallons (3,800 litres) of treated water. They buy 1,000 gallons of non-treated water at 3 sen from us.<br><br>"Assuming that the cost of treating the water is $S2, selling it at S$20, which is RM40, means a huge profit and we don't think that we should contribute to that," he said. </strong><br><br>hey... since when did the seller start to question his customers on wat to do with his products? next time they are going to tell us to use the water solely to wash our asses..  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br><br>haha... we made huge profit and he dont think he should contribute to that?..hey... u jealous issit?</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Should we ever go to a military conflict(I think a major war will not be very possible) over Pedra Branca. What are our options?
