"Enemy left charge!"  WHAT?? Charge into enemy? not take cover, fire some rounds, pray, call arty or maybe fall back... die already. Why charge INTO enemy (must be crazy)? That has been proven time and time to be only escape from ambush 'kill zone'. Only way to do that is by instinctive drilling time and over again. Thinking solider will have brains shot out before 3rd heartbeat.<br><br>Don't get me wrong, we need some brains to operate complex systems, navigate and problem solve but there's a time and a pace for everything.
