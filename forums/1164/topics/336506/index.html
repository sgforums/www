              There have been a number of significant agreements recently with US defence companies, 2 of which have drawn notable interest. First is the integration of the Sniper pod for the F-16C/Ds. This provides significant long range real time intel and deep strike potential for the front-line aircraft. The integration of the Sniper pod into the 3G environment provides the SAF with better real-time battlefield awareness. The larger number of aircraft with this capability also provides more "eyes in the sky" and releases other aircraft such as the F-15 to other important duties.
              
              Second, the paveway 2 and 3 program have been extended not only to the F-15 and F-16s in RSAF inventory but also the F-5 and A-4s. This appear to suggest that even legacy skyhawks in RSAF reserve could be given a significant upgrade in ground attack capabilities.
              
              The paveway 3 program in particular provides mid-ranged stand-off LGB strike options (in excess of 30km range for certain high altitude launch profiles) and extended range for low level strikes with deadly accuracy (low CEP).
              
              The paveway 3 munitions are more expensive than paveway 2s which means the latter will remain in significant quantities. GBU-10s and 12s are present in RSAF inventories.
              
              Both the F-5 and A-4 series are already Maverick-capable. The paveway capability provides a much lower-cost yet equally effective capability.  
              
              The package does not appear to include the enhanced paveway series. However, GPS/INS JDAM tailkits are already available to the RSAF so the additional flexibility offered by the enhanced series does not appear to be required at this time.

              That's why the skyhawk has been withdrawn from frontline service. Doesn't mean it can't still fly though. A significant proportion of the aircraft were withdrawn with some amount of airframe life left (not to mention that the engines were newer).
              
              All aircraft suffer stresses from jet use. Same thing with the F-18s esp on carriers which had additional stresses on take-offs and landings. 
              
              Its consistent to see A-4s being used as teaching aids in tertiary institutions. The knowledge to maintain the aircraft will continue for quite some time.
              
              That mindef decided to install the paveway 2/3 upgrades into the A-4 is illuminating. That's a lot of shooters in reserve.
