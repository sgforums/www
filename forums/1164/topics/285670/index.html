Â“Singapore had proposed to use our air space for training and Kalaikunda is their airbase of choice,Â” a senior Indian Air Force officer said.<br><br>Besides facilities for Electronic Warfare (EW) training, Kalaikunda has a ground firing and aerial combat range in its vicinity. IAF also operates its Â‘LakshyaÂ’ aerial combat training UAV from a nearby location.<br><br>While Singapore has one of the most potent air forces in the region, its biggest constraint is a lack of space to train its personnel. The prosperous island nation, with a total area of just 700 sq km, currently uses the Pearce Airbase in Australia for basic flying training and the Cazaux Airbase in France for fighter pilot training. It also uses facilities in the US for advanced training.<br><br>Singapore will be paying the Defence Ministry for using training facilities and possibly upgrading them in the future, but the Indian Air Force (IAF) is more excited about getting to train with the city stateÂ’s F-16 Fighting Falcon aircraft that are also the mainstay fighters of the Pakistani Air Force (PAF). Â“We will get to practice with the latest F-16 fighters used by Singapore, which is very crucial, as the same type of aircraft are in service with one of our potential adversaries,Â” the officer said.<br><br>IAF pilots got the first opportunity to size up the F-16 fighters, acquired by Pakistan two decades ago, when it took part in the Â‘SindexÂ’ exercise with Singapore at Gwalior in 2004. Defence Ministry officials said the agreement is only a start and a comprehensive defence cooperation program, covering all three service, is likely to be formalised shortly.</div>

In New Delhi, Minister Teo is scheduled to call on Defence Minister A K Antony, External Affairs Minister Pranab Mukherjee and Home Affairs Minister Shivraj Patil. Minister Teo will also meet with the three Indian Service Chiefs - Chairman of the Chiefs of Staff Committee / Chief Of Naval Staff ADM Sureesh Mehta, Chief of Air Staff ACM Fali Homi Major and Chief of Army Staff GEN Deepak Kapoor. While in India, Minister Teo will also observe the joint artillery exercise between the Singapore Army and the Indian Army.<br><br>This is Minister Teo's third visit to India as Minister for Defence, following previous visits in October 2003 and March 2005. During Minister Teo's introductory visit in 2003, he signed the Defence Cooperation Agreement, which provided for cooperation in a wide range of activities. Since then, bilateral interactions between the Singapore Armed Forces and Indian Armed Forces have grown in scope and depth to include joint exercises, Service-level staff talks and cross-attendance of courses. There are also regular policy dialogues between the two defence establishments and exchanges in the area of defence technology.<br><br>Minister Teo's visit follows soon after Permanent Secretary (Defence) Chiang Chie Foo's visit to India to co-chair the 4th Defence Policy Dialogue (DPD). During the DPD, Mr Chiang and Indian Defence Secretary Vijay Singh signed the Bilateral Agreement for the Conduct of Joint Military Training and Exercises in India between the Republic of Singapore Air Force (RSAF) and the Indian Air Force (IAF). The two visits underscore the warm and growing defence relations between Singapore and India.<br><br><a href="http://www.mindef.gov.sg/imindef/news_and_events/nr/2007/oct/17oct07_nr.html" rel="nofollow">Minister for Defence Visits Bilateral Artillery Exercise in India</a><br><br>Minister for Defence Teo Chee Hean was in Devlali, India today to observe the fourth joint artillery exercise, Exercise Agni Warrior, between the Singapore and Indian Armies. The exercise, which runs from 15 Oct to 6 Nov 07, will see the two armies engage in joint live-firing, and will provide valuable opportunities for both sides to understand each other's doctrine and tactics, as well as enhance mutual understanding and inter-operability.<br><br>Bilateral defence interactions have grown in recent years. There are regular exchanges between the two defence establishments in the form of policy dialogues, visits and courses. Apart from the bilateral exercises between the two armies, the Republic of Singapore Air Force (RSAF) and the Republic of Singapore Navy (RSN) also exercise regularly with their Indian counterparts. The RSN and the Indian Navy conduct an annual exercise, code-named SIMBEX, which has grown in scope and complexity over the years to include three-dimensional warfare and bilateral maritime patrol exercises. The RSAF and the Indian Air Force have conducted four bilateral exercises since the inaugural exercise in Gwalior in October 2004, with the most recent exercise held in Singapore for the first time in December 2006. Last week, Permanent Secretary (Defence) Chiang Chie Foo and Indian Defence Secretary Vijay Singh signed the Bilateral Agreement for the Conduct of Joint Military Training and Exercises in India between the Republic of Singapore Air Force (RSAF) and the Indian Air Force (IAF). The conclusion of the agreement is testament to the growing bilateral relations between India and Singapore.<br><br>Minister Teo, who is on a four-day official visit to India, also had the opportunity to meet with senior Indian political and defence leaders, including Defence Minister Mr A K Antony, External Affairs Minister Mr Pranab Mukherjee and Home Affairs Minister Shivraj Patil.
