              <p style="margin-bottom: 13px; border-collapse: collapse; background-repeat: no-repeat no-repeat;">Vo Nguyen Giap, the celebrated general who masterminded the defeat of the French military at Dien Bien Phu and led North <a style="padding: 0px; margin: 0px; border-collapse: collapse; color: #005689; background-repeat: no-repeat no-repeat;" title="More from guardian.co.uk on Vietnam" href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/vietnam">Vietnam</a>'s forces against the US, has died aged 102 at a military hospital in Hanoi.</p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 13px; border-collapse: collapse; background-repeat: no-repeat no-repeat;">Giap, whose victory at Dien Bien Phu triggered France's departure from Indo-China, was a self-taught leader regarded as one of the great military geniuses of the post-second world war era.</p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 13px; border-collapse: collapse; background-repeat: no-repeat no-repeat;">He remained as the commander of the North's forces supporting the Viet Cong throughout the subsequent Vietnam war, being credited with the 1968 Tet offensive.</p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 13px; border-collapse: collapse; background-repeat: no-repeat no-repeat;">Giap, known as the Red Napoleon, was a national hero whose reputation was second only to that of Ho Chi Minh.</p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 13px; border-collapse: collapse; background-repeat: no-repeat no-repeat;">While some, such as the American journalist Stanley Karnow, regarded him as a strategist in the mould of Wellington, others, including the US general William Westmorland, believed his success was down to his ruthlessness.</p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 13px; border-collapse: collapse; background-repeat: no-repeat no-repeat;">Indeed, Westmorland complained to Karnow: "Any American commander who took the same vast losses as General Giap would have been sacked overnight."</p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 13px; border-collapse: collapse; background-repeat: no-repeat no-repeat;">Giap was born in the village of An Xa on 25 August 1911 and attended the University of Hanoi, gaining degrees in politics and law, before working as a journalist.</p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 13px; border-collapse: collapse; background-repeat: no-repeat no-repeat;">It was his command of Viet Minh forces during the eight-week battle of Dien Bien Phu, which raged from March to May in 1954, that made his reputation.</p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 13px; border-collapse: collapse; background-repeat: no-repeat no-repeat;">Vietnamese forces, who wore sandals made of car tyres and lugged their artillery piece by piece over mountains, managed to encircle and crush the French troops in a bloody engagement immortalised in Bernard Fall's Hell in a Very Small Place.</p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 13px; border-collapse: collapse; background-repeat: no-repeat no-repeat;">Although he was at first a renowned exponent of guerilla tactics, Giap commanded a devastating conventional assault at Dien Bien Phu, in which his forces used Chinese-supplied artillery to prevent effective resupply by air of the base deep in the hills of north-western Vietnam.</p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 13px; border-collapse: collapse; background-repeat: no-repeat no-repeat;">During the bitter fighting that would follow, the garrison, comprising a series of outposts in a deep valley, gradually succumbed.</p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 13px; border-collapse: collapse; background-repeat: no-repeat no-repeat;">On the brink of being overrun by Giap's forces, the French commander, Christian de Castries, was forbidden to surrender in an infamous order from his superior, General René Cogny in Hanoi, who told him: "You will fight to the end. It is out of the question to run up the white flag after your heroic resistance."</p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 13px; border-collapse: collapse; background-repeat: no-repeat no-repeat;">The unlikely victory, which is still studied at military schools, led not only to Vietnam's independence but hastened the collapse of colonialism across Indochina and beyond.</p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 13px; border-collapse: collapse; background-repeat: no-repeat no-repeat;">Giap went on to defeat the US-backed South Vietnam government in April 1975, reuniting a country that had been split into communist and non-communist states. He regularly accepted heavy combat losses to achieve his goals.</p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 13px; border-collapse: collapse; background-repeat: no-repeat no-repeat;">"No other wars for national liberation were as fierce or caused as many losses as this war," Giap told the Associated Press in 2005 in one of his last-known interviews with foreign media on the eve of the 30th anniversary of the fall of Saigon, the former South Vietnamese capital.</p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 13px; border-collapse: collapse; background-repeat: no-repeat no-repeat;">"But we still fought because for Vietnam, nothing is more precious than independence and freedom," he said, repeating a famous quote by Ho Chi Minh.</p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 13px; border-collapse: collapse; background-repeat: no-repeat no-repeat;">In later life Giap served as deputy premier and minister of defence.</p>

              </div>
              <p> </p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 10px; font-size: 1.3em; font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">According to The Associated Press, <a style="color: #005ea6;" href="http://www.usnews.com/news/world/articles/2013/10/04/legendary-vietnam-gen-vo-nguyen-giap-dies">Giap died in a military hospital</a> in Hanoi where he had been for the past four years.</p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 10px; font-size: 1.3em; font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">Giap, second only in reverence in Vietnam to Ho Chi Minh, is widely credited with developing the guerilla warfare tactics that are currently used by modern-day terrorists. His defeat of the French at Dien Bien Phu after two months of siege in 1954 effectively ended that country's colonial rule and set the stage for the costly involvement of the U.S. in the Southeast Asian nation. The military victory is still studied in war colleges.</p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 10px; font-size: 1.3em; font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">Giap oversaw the Tet Offensive in 1968, which began the long, painful withdrawal of American forces from Vietnam, a process that was not completed until the mid-1970s.</p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 10px; font-size: 1.3em; font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">Born into a peasant family, in later life Giap lived the role of a philosopher king and was routinely visited by military and political leaders from around the world, including Fidel Castro in 2003.</p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 10px; font-size: 1.3em; font-family: Arial, sans-serif;"><a style="color: #005ea6;" href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/local/obituaries/military-leader-vo-nguyen-giap-defeated-french-us-forces-in-vietnam-conflicts/2013/10/04/897ffff2-c5da-11df-94e1-c5afa35a9e59_story.html">Giap began his military career at 14</a>, enrolling with a clandestine resistance movement, then joined Ho's Communist Party and fled to China with him ahead of Japan's invasion of Vietnam in 1938.</p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 10px; font-size: 1.3em; font-family: Arial, sans-serif;"><span style="font-size: 1.3em; line-height: 1.231;">He later served as defense minister and deputy prime minister following the end of the Vietnam War.</span></p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 10px; font-size: 1.3em; font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">Giap developed a ragtag army of guerillas who lacked the most basic of essentials but who were superbly trained and outsmarted the richer and better-fed soldiers first of France and then the U.S.. Guile, surprise and stealth carried the day against countries that poured guns, aircraft and warships into the region.</p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 10px; font-size: 1.3em; font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">Ironically, Giap has been quoted as saying the bombardment of Hanoi by President Johnson in 1972 [sic] was working and that if Johnson had only continued with it longer, it would have resulted in an American victory. But the campaign was hugely unpopular at home, sparking massive demonstrations and pitting generation against generation. In the end, the war led to Johnson choosing not to seek a second term.</p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 10px; font-size: 1.3em; font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">According to the AP, historian Stanley Karnow interviewed Giap in Hanoi in 1990, quoting him as saying:<strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #ff0000;"> "We were not strong enough to drive out a half million American troops, but that wasn't our aim. Our intention was to break the will of the American government to continue the war."</span></span></strong></p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 10px; font-size: 1.3em; font-family: Arial, sans-serif;"><span style="font-size: 1.3em; line-height: 1.231;">Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., took to Twitter to recognize the general's death and recount a personal experience with his former enemy.</span></p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 10px; font-size: 1.3em; font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">"Gen. Vo Nguyen Giap has passed away," wrote McCain, a Navy pilot during the Vietnam War who spent more than five years in a North Vietnamese POW camp. "Brilliant military strategist who once told me that we were an 'honorable enemy.'"</p>
