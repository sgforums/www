"some important technology.." also note that these two boats are not AIP equipped, it's the other two boats in service with swedish navy that is AIP. No wonder so cheap. And there's no mention that it'll be AIP equipped. Quite sad to buy two non-AIP equipped sub again. Some crap stuff<br><br></div>

Some crap stuff<br><br></div></blockquote>Did you read thru the whole thread???<br><br>Obviously you did not!!!<br><br>Here what is reported by Mindef on 4th Nov 2005:<br><blockquote>The Vastergotland-class submarines <strong>will be upgraded </strong>and converted for operations in tropical waters before they are delivered to the RSN, to replace some of the Challenger-class subs.<br></blockquote>So what is the upgrades???<br><br>You and I know that Mindef will not reveal much details abt any upgrades.<br><br>Before the official release , David Boey from ST reported this from The Strait Times, Sep 29 , 2005 :<br><br><blockquote><strong><br>Defence analysts said the Vastergotlands would give the RSN's submarine force more punch, as the subs have been fitted with a new kind of engine called 'air independent propulsion'. This engine allows the sub to stay underwater longer.</strong><br></blockquote>Next is Janes in 06 October 2005 reported this:<br><br><blockquote><br><strong>The package is expected to include modernisation refits prior to delivery incorporating the addition of a Stirling air-independent propulsion (AIP) system. </strong><br><br><a href="http://www.janes.com/defence/naval_forces/news/jni/jni051006_1_n.shtml" rel="nofollow">http://www.janes.com/defence/naval_forces/news/jni/jni051006_1_n.shtml</a><br></blockquote>Lastly we have this from Strategypage:<br><br><blockquote><span class="large"><strong>Singapore's Super Subs </strong></span><br><br>November 7, 2005: Singapore  will buy 2 Swedish A-17 Vastergotland submarines, which are expected to enter service starting in 2010, replacing some of current Challenger-class submarines. This fits into Singapore's traditional method of acquiring new capabilities, where old refurbished platforms are first purchased to gain operational experience before newer weapons systems are acquired.<br><br>In 1995, Singapore purchased 4 A-11 Challenger Class (ex-SjÃ¶bjÃ¶rnen Class), the first of which was launched in 1968. The Challenger Class were not only refitted for tropical conditions, but also received weapons system and sensor upgrades. These  submarines  performed very well in exercises against US Navy and Royal Australian Navy units, proving that these old boats, when handled well in littoral conditions, are quiet and maneuverable subs that are able to give a pretty good account of themselves.<br><br>Of the 4 submarines in the Vastergotland class that Sweden built between 1987 and 1990, the first two boats, the HMS HMS Vastergotland and HMS Halsingland were taken out of Royal Swedish Navy active service in 2004, while the other two, the HMS Sodermanland and HMS Ostergotland, received such significant upgrades in 2003-2004 that they are considered a new class.<br><br>In particular, apart from weapons system and stealth system improvements, these boats received a 12 metre (36 foot) hull extension in order to use the Stirling Air Independent Propulsion System, making them, along with the 3 submarines of the follow on A-19 Gotland Class, probably the quietest and most advanced conventional submarines currently in operational service the world. The Stirling AIP system is a propulsion system that uses diesel fuel and Liquid Oxygen in a closed system, and greatly increases a conventional submarine's submerged endurance. With AIP systems, conventional submarines can go for weeks without having to surface or snorkel in order to recharge their batteries.<br><br><strong>Singapore has purchased the deactivated HMS Vastergotland and HMS Halsingland, and it is more than likely that part of the upgrades that these boats will receive will include the Stirling AIP hull extension, making them virtually identical to the Sodermanland Class. This means that by 2010, the RSN will be operating two of the quietest and most lethal conventional submarines in the world</strong>, and probably at a pretty good price - definitely below the cost of a new Gotland sub, which has been suggested at $100 million each, while the German U-212 Class has been estimated at $250 million a copy.<br><br>Just how lethal will these subs be? Well, take into consideration that the state-of-the-art Gotland Class, which is essentially an improved Vastergotland Class with the Stirling AIP system incorporated from the beginning, is considered so quiet and so deadly that the USN has leased the HMS Gotland for a year in order to practice and develop its ASW tactics against a first class opponent.<br><br><a href="http://www.strategypage.com/htmw/htsub/articles/20051107.aspx" rel="nofollow">http://www.strategypage.com/htmw/htsub/articles/20051107.aspx</a></blockquote>Will Mindef officially announced that they are AIP???<br><br>You could wait till the 2 boats retired and yet you would not get that!!!!<br><br>Anyway , we could confirm it when the pix of the RSN's Vastergotlands are released, they should have much longer hull if they are AIP.<br><br>Here a good pix for future reference:<br><img src="http://www.varnpliktsnytt.se/artbilder/1968_0.jpg"><br><br>The original Vastergotlands, the length of the front hull in front of the tower(sail or fin) is almost equal to the length of back hull( the propeller section is underwater), thus it will look like equal length as shown in this pix:<br><br><a href="http://www.ubatsvapnet100.com/gal_image.asp?id=315" rel="nofollow">http://www.ubatsvapnet100.com/gal_image.asp?id=315</a><br><br>The upgraded Vastergotlands will have longer back hull as shown below:<br><img src="http://www.kockums.se/Submarines/Resources/nyvgdstirl1a.jpeg"><br><br>So wait for the release of pix of RSN's Vastergotlands !!!</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Australia wanted longer endurance and time-spent at sea for thier subs. Given thier larger area of control and expeditious nature of thier forces tagged to US`s adventures overseas as it is, I think that`s the case.  Don`t think we need something that large. Also, RSN is looking at the region and our naval assests as a whole and we match up and could reasonably overcome the threat posed by regional navies.<br><br>More importantly and not just the case of following a known but infrequent trend of buying second hand goods first, I suspect we are actually waiting for certain technologies to mature and than make our purchase. Say if we buy now, it`d be superseded by newer subs coming out next decade and it does`nt make cost sense to buy again. We`d be carving a small lead in naval war-fare to steal a mile in the future. So, we`d always be having the last laugh. We`d be good buddies with the Swedes by then.</div>
