I read before that our F-5S/T have shot down before an F-18 during one of those exercise with the other countries. So can we say F-5S/T is better than the F-18 and that it can P-own F-18. NO!!! Just bcos there is an isolated case of such event, we cannot conclude F-5 is superior to F-18. Unless we can get a large consistent data of F-5 defeating F-18, or perhaps in real war engagements, we can just rule that that particular RSAF pilot is more well trained, his opponent is less trained or even bcos the situation favours him/her.

            <div class='col-md body'>went to NLB today... found the magazine... and read it.<br><br>there was no mention of RSAF beating the IAF under the defence section.. i read 3 times to make sure i didnt miss it.<br><br>undeterred... i read on.. and finally found it on the second half of the magazine on issue related to AV-8 harrier...<br><br>its just a short 2 liner... no details.. just a simple sentence that RSAF beat the IAF and "wash away the american shame".... something like that...  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br>unsatisfied... i went back 2 dozen issue and found a another issue on cope india 2004 and 2005 with the USAF F-15 and F-16 vs the IAF SU-30...  more detail... and probably gave an insight on why the F-16 would succeed where the F-15 failed...<br><br>read enough to know... that the IAF didnt really beat up the F-15 or the F-16... so much restriction was placed on the USAF aircraft...  i think our F-5S and the retired A-4S also stand a very good chance in winning the USAF F-15.<br><br>ran out of time... and left... will go back to NLB... hopefully can find something related to RSAF vs IAF... but chances... 50/50...<br><br>if i do find it... i will post it.. maybe even upload some scans...<br><br></div>
