Su 30 MKM is one heck of aircraft.<br><br>In any air force combined exercise there is no such thing as 'this AC pwned this AC'... the truth is whoever become the agressor (usually the host country will provide the agressor squadron) will be beaten due to what ever restriction (depending on who is the imaginery enemy is) they imposed on the opfor.<br><br>for example during one of the joint exercise with the IAF the opfor were given restriction in terms of tactic and equipment to simulate the north Korean MiG.<br><br>so when some paper pusher said 'ah we beat the craap of their advanced AC during exercise..

Manmohan Singh himself said that India should and will leverage their considerable purchasing power for military equipment to maximize economic and political benefits as well .....<br><br>planes pretty much comes in package deals now ..... even if the flankers pwnz vipers, you'd still get LBGs, mavericks, amrams, aim 9x, helmet mounted sights, night visions, advance radars out of the package .... and throw that in as a sweetener for any US-India trade pack perhaps ....<br><br>the cold war is over ... India is trying to realign itself with the US now, what with the chinese dragon rising on her borders, and a pakistan armed with strategic nuclear weapons .... so yeah, frittering away a few billions for some 3 generation fighter designed in the 70s still makes good sense ...</div>
