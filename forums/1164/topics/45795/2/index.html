The CDF and Service Chiefs know about the same "secret", so its not a secret anymore? What reasoning is that?<br><br>Like I mentioned earlier, Its all well and good as long as <strong>public domain</strong> information is discussed. That is, information that is available to the public. For those shady pieces of information, it is best to state its source as well, if you can't, don't throw it out here and make a fool of yourself, because no one here will believe it. And don't violate something called the OSA as well.<br><br>The last thing we need here is people going around and claiming/posting things that are very obviously not public information. Like bcoy posted earlier, we must also drop that arrogant and discriminating attitude. Those who are regular here have their fair share of experiences. People who come in with such an attitude will simply get blackmarked.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Dear Bcoy and Exco,<br>I have news for u. Where do u think the SOF get their training from?Locally? Did u think they developed all their tactics by themselves?The answer is no. Do you think they got training from SAS? GSG- 9? The Israelis? SEALs? The answer is yes to all of the above. Do you think the countries that they received their training from did not quietly evaluate the standard and quality of our SOF for their own intelligence service? Of course they did. They probably have the names, photos, favourite food of all the senior officers and NCOs in the SOF. Even the traditions are the same as the other elite units they received their training from. For example, there is a brass ship's bell that is hang in a public place in the SOF camp. Anytime you cannot tahan anymore, you just go and ring the bell. This will signify that you want to drop out and leave the SOF. Gee, doesn't that sound familiar. I wonder who else has this tradition. The SEALs and the SAS maybe? Don;t be naive. There are countries out there that know much much more about the SAF than all the forumners here combined. If you want limits on a forum, or if u want to self-censor yourself, go to the PAP website. I am not interested in that, ALready got too many restrictions in my daily life.<br>Besides, your little rule is administered arbitrarily. Someone started a thread saying they have inside info that the RSAF has selected the F-18, and I didn;t see anyone tell him to shut up and not spill secrets. Instead, there was a lively discussion on that thread. What gives?<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by bcoy:</div><div class="quote_body">On The Way - We all know the answers and I'm sure you do too, but sometimes its better not to answer certain posts here.

            <div class='col-md body'>sensorship should be used if it endangers life eg. people's identity, weaknesses in systems etc. the fact is if it doesnt hurt anyone that i suppose we can talk about it. btw papers said that SOF was trained by Israeli CT unit Sayaret Mat'Kal, UK's SAS and American Delta Force. these units got the experience in handling hostage takers. It all usually ends with double-taps to the heads of the terrorists. easier to make martyrs out of them then sent them to jail and their friends do another hijack and negotiate for them. thats why SOF killed all 3 of the Pakistani terrorists. I heard somewhere that STAR team was trained by Israeli border guard CT team Sayaret YAMAM<br>and GSG-9 although its not confirmed.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Yes, I understand your point that certain units are trained overseas. Have those countries released information about the unit which train there? When it comes to a unit like the SOF, a lot of guesswork is involved, more often than not we try to link them with the doctrines/operations of other elite forces. Of course, nothing is wrong with that, because that is <strong>your personal deductions</strong>.<br><br>Lets not get into a pissing contest on what we can talk about or not. Everyone who has gone thru NS should know what they can talk about, and what they can't. The moderators here have a very fined tuned sense of such matters as well.</div>

We'll remove posts that discusses things which are out of the public domain. By public domain, we mean things that:<br><br>- In terms of arms sales, equipment that the SAF does not acknowledge to be having, or equipment the original vendor does not acknowledge to have sold to Singapore<br><br>- In terms of training and capabilities, things that have not been discussed in the public domain (newspapers, print media etc) are not allowed.<br><br>- Rumours must be pointed out as such. This is the reason why the post about rumours Singapore has got the F/A-18 were left undeleted. The poster made it clear it was such<br><br>- Its been posted before and I'll post this again. Should anyone come into contact with something unknown in the public domain in the course of their work etc, please leave that out of this forum. If you have to blab about it, please go somewhere else to blab about it. If you're interested in violating the OSA, please go ahead, but leave the other moderators and me out of it. We have no interest in getting into trouble with violating the OSA and seeing this forum shut down.

            <div class='col-md body'>Exactly! Top secret information like our RSSF (Republic of Singapore Space Force) Gundam suits should be left out of discussion.  Those 8 Storey tall robots with partical cannons and over 100 air and ground capable missiles should not even appear on this topic!  The fact that we have 124 of them is totally out of the question.  Just imagine how the malaysians would freak out if they discovered that we are ahead of the Japanese in Gundam designs! And if they found out that we had a space colony on the moon... oh my goodness.. it will be a terrible security leak.<br><br>Guys, respect the tags at the bottom of those documents that u read.  If its confidential, keep it that way.</div>
