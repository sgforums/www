The JLTV goal is a family of vehicles with companion trailers capable of performing multiple mission roles that will be designed to provide protected, sustained, networked mobility for personnel and payloads across the full Range of Military Operations (ROMO). JLTV objectives include increased protection and performance over the current fleet; minimizing ownership costs by maximizing commonality, fuel efficiency and other means; maintaining effective competition throughout the lifecycle.</span>

              <p>When SG can win over many platforms from all over the world,incl G8 countries,can i say it is world class?There are some 60 platforms to bid the US contract  around 2002.</p>

              <p>Bionix will be selling like hotcakes since 2002 if it is that good.</p>

              <p>hahaha actually i think Terrex is good enough for JLTV. Really:) See whether US wants it or not.</p>
              <p>nope no 2 man turret. even if it has it is using the BXI turret, not the BXII one i think.</p>
              <p>BX not selling like hotcakes not because it isnt good. in fact it is very good, despite many complaints from our army boys. its jus that its customized to our own terrain, US cant get optimum performance from the BX, which is why they developed their own bradley.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Anyway on why BX is good,</p>
              <p>1) Ease of use. Those trained in BX will understand</p>
              <p>2) Mobility. its small, powerful, and can pivot. Plus can 'swim'</p>
              <p>3) Firepower. 25/30mm bushmaster, same as bradley.</p>
              <p>4) and many more.</p>

              <p>hmm mayb i shld elaborate.</p>
              <p>only BX1 turret can fit. BX2's one is too big, due to the upgraded gun.</p>
              <p>hahahaha there are many vehicles not easy to operate. jus ask anyone trained in the other A vehicles to know. BX is seriously easy:)</p>
              <p>One reason why BX has good mobility is the dimensions. it was designed to FIT into singapore's vegetation. try asking tt during army open house. they will tell you more. and unlike SM1 and ULTRA, teh BX can pivot. tts a very huge advantage. u will really love pivot during exercise when u realise u took a wrong turn.</p>
              <p>Well not sure if this is allowed, but BX wont be at war frontline. but u shld have realised this if u know armour doctrine. APCs never make the frontline. Thus it doesnt  matter whether the swimscreen is used or not. anyway the reason why we have to make do with swimscreen is so that we do not have to sacrifice too much armour to make the vehicle light enough to float on its own. its all physics.</p>
              <p>yup feel free to ask more abt the BX. hope this convinces u for now!</p>
              <p>anyway the Stryker vehicle tt america is using has 8 wheels. they arent looking for 4 wheeled A veh.</p>

              <p>If u have not used other A vehicles before, how do u know BX is seriously easy ? I believe BX drivers drive BX only.</p>
              <p>Mobility is totally different as designed to User's needs (eg Dimensions ?).</p>
              <p>Being able to move around in rubber plantation easily does not necessary mean that vehicle has good mobility.</p>
              <p>Well the ULTRA can pivot steering but not on the spot pivoting.</p>
              <p>I not sure are you kidding me that SAF spent many millions on BX and they wont be at the front line ?</p>
              <p>I am not sure if u have heard of 'forward defence' which the 1st barriers we have to overcome are the water bodies ?</p>

              <p>Erm acurara....what are you talking about?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Other than he_loves_his_toilet 's question, you have other flawed stuff</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>BX is BIGGER than an Ultra.  BX has 6 road wheels while ultra has 5.</p>
              <p>I can wave to you from the opposite side of the river while you are still in your bx.</p>
              <p>Bx is fast...that's because it's newer and has a newer/bigger engine.</p>
              <p>BX is better than ultra on a basic level because it is better armoured. Seriously you dont compare vietnam war era stuff with 2000AD stuff right?</p>
              <p>Ultra will have -no- issues with a 30mm cannon either just that it's a waste of money to integrate it.</p>
              <p>Yes i know armour doctrines.  APCs dont go to the frontline. IFVs do. Guess which one is Bx and Ultra(pssst, they are both the same)?</p>
              <p>Singapore where got vegetation for Bx to be "build specifically for?"</p>
              <p>AFAIK, we have more Bxs than tanks.  Which is more "expendable?".</p>
              <p> </p>

              <p>Hmm ok maybe i'll share what i know.</p>
              <p>To answer to toilet's qn on ease of use, i'll use a simple comparision.</p>
              <p>For the 40/50 bx and ultra, you have total auto elevation + traversion of the cupola. for ultra, elevation is manual. dont ask me why, but it was like that. down to the bx, the steering is via steering wheel. many tanks nowadays, be it leopard or merkava, still use levers. for those who have used the sighting system, etc, like changing ammo blah blah blah, whether or not the gun IAs, lets jus say its all good.</p>
              <p>ok well i admit i'm from armour. our definition of mobility doesnt just include like speed, specifications. its more than that. its about adapting to terrain. i duno if this is allowed, but when the bx was designed, the dimensions were given beforehand, i.e, it could not exceed a certain size. tts why its relatively small. this is because we figure bx will need to move arnd in plantations. bx has high mobility because, 1) ok it has a good engine and can pivot on teh spot. 2) tough tracks can tackle almost any terrain. 3) the sideslope it can withstand is quite high. meaning it wont topple easily. 4) engine brake is a big plus. nothing to do with roadwheels here.</p>
              <p>erm well, BX is definitely not on the frontline. it doesnt matter how many millions we spent. it doesnt matter whether BX is an 'APC' or more correctly, an 'IFV'. its simply because there is smth else to go in front. and leopard is one of them. and like i said, we use swimscreen simply because we need to swim and we dont want to compromise our armour, which is well, the biggest factor in armour.</p>
              <p>anyway there is a very good reason why singapore uses track vehicles and we dont use wheels, which is probably faster, more easily replaceble blahblah. interested pm me.</p>

              <p>Actually v simple</p>
              <p>BX 40/50 auto elevation is of course an improvement from ULTRA manual elevation over the years.</p>
              <p>Steering wheel vs levers, just a matter of preference of the User.</p>
              <p>Improved sighting system is part and parcel of tech advancement.</p>
              <p>May I know your vocation ?</p>
              <p>Ability to move is specified terrain is of coz a design pre-requirement. BX is not special because it is small n can move in rubber plantation. BX is special bcos it is Singapore's indigineous IFV.</p>
              <p>Of coz, the tank PC spearhead the ABG attacks, but an ABG consists of tanks and IFVs. Interdependent on each other too.</p>
              <p>Millions of $ spent on BX matters, because its TAXPAYERS $ ! <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/redones/biggrin.png" alt="biggrin.png" width="15" height="15"></p>
              <p>I do not think that BX w/o its armor plates can swim like the Broncos or ULTRA. Since you say BX is not a frontline vehicle, why is there a compromise in armor protection when swimming ?</p>
              <p>Explain why it doesnt matter whether the swimscreen is used or not, do u mean it doesnt matter that our vehicles can swim anot ?</p>
              <p>Lastly, I am not sure if you know how many roadwheel a BX has...</p>

              <p> </p>
              <p>If you mean the Bx is not supposed to trade shots with MBTs then yes that's not what it's supposed to do.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>But if you think that it's not going to be contacted by the enemy and designed to attack as part of its job then you probably are going to be quite wrong.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>And why PM you acurara? It's pretty obvious to the veteran forumers here that your statements are full of holes, and it's also pretty obvious that you don't seem to know AFVs very well at all from what you have said... please compare the Bx with other similar systems before you make your statements.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Another one of your statements that show a somewhat lack of knowledge of subject matter:</p>
              <p> </p>
              <blockquote>

              <p>It's obvious you are trying to smoke your way through... I've seen the interior driver's position of a Leopard and Merky before... like most modern tank use what you deem as a "steering wheel".</p>

              <p>sigh.</p>
              <p>I am trained in armour by vocation, and commissioned as an armour officer, trained on BX platform. Worked in ****.</p>
              <p>Yes tanks and apcs work together, but no does not mean they are not interdependant. however it doesnt mean that tact teams of both lead the way. there are some other stuff teh saf has to lead the way.</p>
              <p>well as for the compromising of armour for the swimming. there are 5 main elements of armour: Armour itself, Mobility, Firepower, Shock, Flexibility. we didnt believe in sacrificing armour for full swimming capabilities, simply because bx is not frontline. and the saf is not so stupid to allow bx to swim w/o protection. there will be other elements nearby.</p>
              <p>to ST, the main reason why we have armour infantry is not for frontline. it is to offer flexibility. Simply because of our vegetation, sometimes its better for infantry than armoured vehicles. u can have main guns hitting trees.</p>
              <p>And ST, if u've seen the inside of merkey and leopard, are u from the saf? i should think so.</p>

              <p>The front is very big.  BX might not be your front line unit but IFVs are in mine.</p>

              <p>haha oh well BX while good on the move, is a bit sadistic. 2 man turret is quite cramped and stuffy, esp when fan spoils. i take it u're at least a spec or gunner?</p>
              <p>haha oh well the swimming set up is, well, its not hard but it isnt as easy as M113. i rmb looking in envy watching the M113s jus sliding into the water. then the bx crew still doing swimming kit, v sian one</p>
              <p>but the rest will be fun. esp driving and shooting. quite cool:) Hopefully u get BXII instead of BXI. BX II is SHIOK man. imagine playing solitaire on the move. and 30mm ammo looks nice too</p>
