            <div class='col-md body'>the problem is security... not islam.. not how loosen we are or how far we have come as a nation or as a people.<br><br>muslims are begged to understands the peculiar geopolitical situation that singapore faces...<br><br>on top of that...  we have the JI and the revelation of a malay muslim working under STA in PLAF snapping pictures of the base and aircrafts in PLAF.<br><br>all these no doubt work against the muslim community in singapore as well as those in SAF service.<br><br>to ignore the and dismiss the harsh reality facing us... is to have compromise the security and safety of all the citizens of singapore including the muslims and malays of singapore citizenship.<br><br>the fact that you even ask such a question about your future in RSAF if you married a muslim... shows that you knew the sensitivity of the issue yourself.<br><br>but there are no one here nor in SAF that can guarantee your future in RSAF irreguardless if you marry a muslim or not...<br><br>however, it will become an easy excuse for you to blame yourself for marrying a muslim wife when your careers in the RSAF should falter... even though the subject of your marriage might not have been the cause.<br><br>its always easy to blame others then blame yourself...<br><br>just one advice... marriage is not about your career... its about you and her coming together to build a new family....<br><br>you can change your career easily... but not your wife.</div>

Hence , it will pre-empt the battle.<br><br>If Singapore waits for the enemy to invade first , then it is game over .<br>Pre-empting the enemy means that you are most likely going to fire and kill harmless troops who are readying themselves who might or might not have the intention to fight.<br><br>That means while the invaders are sleeping in order to ready for the battle tomorrow or awaiting further orders , you are going to violate United nations<br>"rules" which was imposed in the first place .Cause in other words, you become the aggressor.<br><br>On the other hand , If the battle is done in Singapore , it means the potential invader becomes the aggressor , Singapore would not risk the chance of violating UN "rules" , but it would be too late for singapore to react by then.<br><br>Hence, most likely , as a soldier during wartime , our NS man will be likely to kill an innocent soldier who is resting along the border getting ready for further instructions plans/pullout.<br><br>Thats the risk , Singapore faces ... with the UAV today , we will be the eyes to see what happens and apply<strong> decisive force.</strong><br><br>I rather we violate the UN "rules" , <span style="color: red;">blood</span> must be spilled if anyone foreign invader harbours the intention to come over with evil intentions</div>
