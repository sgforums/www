But I certainly hope that this will change soon,at least loosen up a little, as this will affect the morale of our muslim brothers in arms. Because they will felt that they are being side-lined and being discriminated against. I understand the need for such arrangement but times are different now. We are no longer at the nation's infancy stage,we are maturing as a society and as a country.The current defence situation in Singapore have also changed. Therefore,we should at least loosen up a bit and gradually change to an SAF which practises real meritocracy. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"> </div></blockquote>nicely put. i know that circumstances call for things to be the way they are, but i hope that one day viewing each man based on his race will change, cause we're all singaporeans.<br><br>hell, i have many malay friends, and i'm half-malay too and i think that the malays should not be classified as a whole. extremists and potential terrorists are isolated cases and can also occur in other races.<br><br>someone said many malays/muslims don't like to serve in the army anyway and instead, go private. this may be true to a certain extent but knowing that they are very unlikely to rise up through the ranks would indefinitely put the thought of being a reg, away.<br><br>well, i have a situation myself. i'm mixed, malay-chinese, but i have malay name with muhamad inside it also, but i'm a christian now and i'm going to remove the muhamad in my name, so how? would that affect the prospect of me being assigned to more sensitive areas where there are hardly/not many malays assigned to it?</div>
