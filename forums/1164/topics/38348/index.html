Everyone know that Singapore do practice military ties with taiwan , however they shd not hightlight the very fact singaporean forces may wayang the invading RED ARMY. Trust mi , our reddish buddy will get angry with that...<br><br>If china will to attack taiwan , i dun think the Chinese SSM will allow the bulk of the taiwanese force to meet face to face with them. Btw dun always think that taiwan is militarily superior to china. My father use to tell mi how the chinese SOF perform regular light sabotage onto taiwanese military facilities in Qingmen , when he was post to taiwan for numerous training.</div>

However if PLA will to crush the ROC , half the battle have been won. No matter how US comes in to help the situation , nationalistic and moral feelings will be very low on the once proud and comfident island.<br><br>Y US will to help taiwan is more to a political issue. However since taiwan is not recognise as a country in the United Nations , i believe China will have reasons to unify it. If taiwan will to declare independence officially and will to enter even heavier defense pact with US , China will attack in the name that she cant allow a security threat looming at her door step.<br><br>For my opinion , US will want Taiwan to be independent as she might provide a long term stationary base for the US pacific force which can efficently secure US interest in immediate China , Phillipines , North Korea and  the Asean regions. China will not let it happen.<br><br>But trust mi ,the war will not occur before 2008 easily becasue of the fact that china's economy is growing , the war will intercrupt her plannings for olympic and her armed force still have more rooms to grow..</div>

Over at the Taiwan military forums, I sometimes read posts which describe how they (Taiwanese), wish they had our weopons and defense technology links with other countries, like Israel. Some have even posted remarks about "borrowing" some of our stuff if war comes.<br><br>Taiwan military forums -<br><a href="http://www.taiwanmilitary.org/pn/index.php" rel="nofollow">http://www.taiwanmilitary.org/pn/index.php</a><br></div>

Look at their tanks , omg is the onli word i can say. ( i heard they had bought Adrams , but that is another issue. ) Frankly , they have a well established aircorp and SOF which Singapore may not be superior to it. Another things is that , their NS seems to be tougher , husher that us , is that an advantage to their fighting spirit , i dun know...<br><br>The airforce have very reasonable equipment. Out of the list , the Mirage 2000 is one hell of a decent piece of flying machine which holds respect between the straits and Singapore. They F-16s are just block 15/20 vintage which current we are using for our blackknights. Their aerospace technology is impressive for a young asian country with production of missiles to planes. The onli factor which Singapore is at a losing side is that their numbers are bigger but yet comparing it with their landsize , not that impressive after all.<br><br>For the navy , okok . They win hands down. On experience and on numbers they will outfight us. However on equipment , hey we are at par on the technology. Taiwanese folks are impressive , they adopt a system from another country which dun recognise them then name it as theirs , freshly baked from their industry. Their KangDing is impressive to edge of technology however their Perry class are vintage yet superior if compare to our missile gunboat and the region navy. They subs are abt the same class as ours , however due to their experience on it , they may have the advantage. However on the long run , Singapore may have the advantage due to the military link with other countries which access us to more training and technology.<br><br>We cant realli compare with taiwan. In term of the overall equipment and manpower , taiwan will be on top of us . They are in a crisis for years whereby China have been threatening them , for survival , i believe they throw in more money than us. If we will to be press by our neighbours oneday , i believe the world will see alot of unthinkable equipment that we will use.</div>

They are more disciplined, strict and drilled. Singapore's training now is more focused on operational tasks and allows soldiers to think for themselves.<br>But other than that, their training is just like us. I spoke to some of them in the field - they are very much like us in fact, when compared to the Americans, Australians, Thais or those from Brunei. Just my opinion after training in Taiwan twice. This is something which the Taiwanese themselves agree.<br><br>One thing I noticed is that their reserve system is nowhere like us. The Taiwanese depend on the fulltime conscripts more, whereas Singapore's main bulk are from the trained reserves. They are just forming proper reserve brigades and practicing recalling them.<br></div>
