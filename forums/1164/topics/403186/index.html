              <p>Hi everyone! I have some queries which I hope you guys can help me address with your expertise =) I completed my national service a year back as a supply assistant, due to a knee injury sustained during bmt. and this has caused me of my officerhood =( saddened but not giving up hope, I worked my way up, finally (and with much hardship) and was promoted to a L-3SG 2 months before I ORD.</p>
              <p>However, after checking with MINDEF, they said that my rank still remained as CPL as it is a local promotion. And despite trying to convince myself to forget about the thought, I could not.</p>
              <p>I have heard of people saying that there is a possibility for one to convert to an officer (or a local officer) during ICT. Is it true? I was quite happy when I first saw that, as for me, being an officer is more than just the rank. It represents a dream which I have always wanted to achieve. However, I have read only 2 such cases, I would really appreciate it alot if you guys can help me address my queries =) at least if it is totally impossible I can totally dismiss it out of my mind.</p>

              The desire for being a policeman appears to stem more from the fact that one was unable to attain a higher position in the army than an actual desire to be a policeman. No point.
                  
              Nothing wrong with the rank nor would it affect life thereafter, unless one wants it to. It doesn't take an officer to be a gentleman or a leader.
                  
              Look on the bright side. Reservist/NS man obligations no or super low. End obligation at 45 instead of 55 = more time with future family etc. 
                  
              It is not one's responsibility to allocate resource across NS so no point thinking too much and no point worrying about organisational inefficiency cos that's outside one's control.
                  
              Spend the time doing important stuff e.g. study (higher degree/languages etc), learn technical skills eg drive/maintain car, network etc. The people one meets in the army = future colleagues at work = friends outside. People who are higher ranks end up, in some cases, being subordinates (and that's for a much longer career than time spent in army).

              <p>hey guys, thanks for your replies, I'm just curious if its possible actually, and yes, I have thought of signing on, but given my PES status I could not (due to my knee injury which I stated on the thread) I am currently schooling once again, and considering to take up a post grad some time soon. I want to take my off this matter as this dream has been haunting me ever since I POP-ed from Tekong.</p>
              <p>Well for me I think its really impossible, and life has its regrets at times. But nevertheless, thanks everyone for taking the time to reply to this thread! </p>

              <p>hey guys, thanks for dropping by =) I agree with some of you in a way, however, sometimes fighting is not done physically, actually all the different vocations will need to work together, not only those which is physically oriented. I have served in logistics and I have never regretted it, despite people saying that it is a 'chao keng' kind of vocation.</p>
              <p>being an officer is not only about being physically fit, but the mental fitness have to be there as well, although I am not an officer, I live my days as a supply assistant with the motto 'to lead to excel to overcome' in me, and sure enough, I was rewarded with a L-3SG rank</p>
              <p>thoughts of signing on has always been on my mind, but due to my physical limitations and past injuries, this has reduced the possibility to almost zero. Actually being an officer to me is not about the pay. Seeing my men and inspiring them, leading the platoon to victory in a particular objective instills a sense of pride in my heart and a smile on my face. Officerhood to me is a dream, and a far fetched goal sadly.</p>

              <p>The only thing I can advise you is that, be proud of your local 3SG.  Sometimes, its important to recognize what you have achieved in life, or in your limited time in NS, given the constraints that you have. </p>
