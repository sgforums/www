            <div class='col-md body'>The following article reposted from f-16.net<br><br>------------------------------------------<br><br><strong>Singapore F-16 down near Ajo </strong><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Trainee pilot is killed; Luke fighters grounded<br>By Enric Volante and Michael Marizco<br>ARIZONA DAILY STAR www.dailystar.com </span><br><br>AJO - F-16 fighters remained grounded at Luke Air Force Base Thursday after one of the jet planes plummeted "like a falling star" in the night, killing the pilot and crashing about 25 miles southeast of Ajo.<br><br>The pilot, Lt. Loo Kwang Han, who went by Brandon Loo while training at Luke, was a 25-year-old Singaporean pilot, said Capt. Vanessa Hillman, a spokeswoman for Luke Air Force Base's 56th Fighter Wing.<br><br>The U.S. Air Force launched a search shortly after the plane, owned by the Republic of Singapore air force, crashed at 9:54 p.m. Wednesday.<br><br>It took off from the base in Glendale with two other aircraft on a training flight but lost radio contact about 45 minutes into the flight, officials said.<br><br>Matthew Pebble, a construction worker who lives in the Tohono O'odham Reservation village of Pisinimo, said he watched the lights of the F-16 from his porch Wednesday night.<br><br>"It came down like a falling star in a straight line, and then - boom!" he said, using his hands to imitate a blast.<br><br>Horses that roam the desert between Gu Vo District and Pisinimo District ran screaming into the mesquite and cholla cacti from the fire. Minutes later, two helicopters flew into the area, Pebble said. He did not know it was an F-16 crash until Thursday morning.<br><br>The plane, which carried no bombs or missiles, was a single-seat F-16C assigned to the base's 56th Fighter Wing. About 200 F-16s, which cost more than $20 million each, are based at Luke. It trains about 1,000 pilots and 1,000 maintenance crew chiefs a year, including some from Singapore and other U.S. allies.<br><br>"We are currently pausing our training operations to allow us some time to stand down and review safety procedures," said spokeswoman Mary Jo May.<br><br>In May 2002, Maj. David Walker, a U.S. pilot, ejected from a Singapore air force F-16 before it crashed on a flight out of Luke. He survived with injury.<br><br>Investigators blamed the incident on a faulty turbine blade that caused a massive fuel leak, turning the jet's PW-229 engine into a fireball.<br><br>In the latter half of last year, the U.S. Air Force identified 44 faulty turbine blades in tests on its own F-16s at Luke. Air Force officials installed new blades and intensified inspections. They said in January that they had the problem under control.<br><br>Hillman said Thursday that the fatigued blades were not found in any Singapore air force jets at Luke after the 2002 crash. "They did not have that problem," she said.<br><br>Pilots from Singapore have trained at Luke for more than 20 years. The nation has one of the most advanced air forces in Asia, but it often keeps aircraft in other countries for training and maintenance.<br><br>Wednesday night's crash was about 10 miles west of Pisinimo, a village of 200 people, said Pisinimo District Chairman Johnson Jose.<br><br>"We've always been opposed to practicing maneuvers over us, but it still happens," he said.<br><br>"Go try that over in Tucson and see how many times you get away with it before they chase you off," he said.<br><br>Officials at the Hickiwan District, closer to Ajo, about 130 miles west of Tucson, were also concerned about military maneuver missions over their heads.<br><br>"We've always had plane crashes here," said Hickiwan District Chairman Manuel Osequeda. He's counted at least 10 in the area since he became chairman 13 years ago, he said. "It's not going to be long before they slam into one of our villages."<br><br>The U.S. Air Force lost one life every 33 days and one aircraft every 17 days at a cost of $1.33 million per day last year, according to the Air Force Safety Center. That doesn't include combat losses.<br><br>Loo Kwang Han attained his pilot wings in July 2001 and became an F-16 pilot in January 2003, Hillman said.<br><br>Â° Contact reporter Enric Volante at 573-4129 or at volante@azstarnet.com.
