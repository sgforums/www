            <div class='col-md body'>Body of pilot arriving home tomorrow<br><br>By David Boey and Natalie Soh<br><br>THE body of air force fighter pilot Brandon Loo Kwang Han, 25, who died when his F-16 crashed in the United States last week, is due to arrive in Singapore tomorrow.<br><br>On Thursday, before his body left the US, Lieutenant Loo's friends and colleagues bid him farewell in a solemn military service in Arizona, where his F-16 detachment is based.<br><br>The funeral here is likely to be held on Tuesday.<br><br>The Straits Times understands that though Lt Loo died while living out his boyhood dream of flying fighter jets, his younger brother too could become an air force pilot.<br><br>The Ministry of Defence confirmed that the younger Loo is a pilot trainee with the Republic of Singapore Air Force. He will be going to Tamworth, Australia, soon for the Air Grading Course.<br><br>This course is conducted by RSAF flying instructors to rate candidates for their interest and aptitude in piloting military aircraft.<br><br>Lt Loo died during a night training mission which took off from Luke Air Force Base in Arizona on May 19. His F-16C fighter crashed in rugged desert terrain near the Mexican border an hour after take-off.<br><br>Lt Loo is the first RSAF fighter pilot to die in 16 years. In the last fatal incident involving a fighter jet, a 23-year-old RSAF pilot died of injuries after ejecting from a Hawker Hunter fighter just outside Clark Air Base in the Philippines.<br><br>The RSAF's latest crash is its second involving a single-seat F-16C.<br><br>In May 2002, an F-16C crashed after pieces from a cracked turbine blade in the plane's Pratt &amp; Whitney PW-229 engine ruptured a fuel line and caused a fire.<br><br>A report from an eyewitness that Lt Loo's plane 'came down like a falling star in a straight line' has led to speculation that it exploded in mid-air.<br><br>In a telephone interview with The Straits Times, Ms Laurie Tardif, communications manager at Pratt &amp; Whitney Military Engines, shrugged off suggestions that engine failure had caused the crash.<br><br>She said yesterday that her company 'did a thorough investigation after the May 2002 crash to find the root cause diligently'. These investigations led Pratt &amp; Whitney to inspect and replace faulty turbine blades. The engine maker 'stands ready to help if asked', she added.</div>

Risks exist in every line of work or profession'; ST, May 2<img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"> in response to the letter, 'Don't forget to salute our brave men in uniform' (ST, May 25), by Mr Jonathan Galaviz.<br><br>Mr Au went to the extent of saying that doctors and nurses who treated Sars patients were 'greater' heroes than a pilot who flew a plane not knowing whether it was going to crash or not.<br><br>Mr Galaviz did not say that pilots are greater heroes compared to all other professions. All that he said was all uniformed personnel should be appreciated.<br><br>Yes, there are risks in every line of work. When Sars broke out, we honoured not only the doctors and nurses, but also many others, including the taxi drivers who did not shun nurses working at Tan Tock Seng Hospital (TTSH).<br><br>People choose events to remind us that we should be thankful for the people who serve our country and people. The F-16 pilot died while serving the country.<br><br>The comparison between doctors facing Sars and a pilot in training is not a fair one. Sars to doctors would be like war to soldiers. I am sure the receptionists at TTSH would not be classified as heroes the way the doctors were, but shouldn't we honour them too?<br><br>Doesn't it require courage to climb into the cockpit day after day to train, knowing that you could die any time? As a former military aviator, I know. Every single flight is a risk, from the time you start that jet to the time you land.<br><br>Many of us have had close shaves, with a few seconds making a difference between life and death. Yet we climbed back into the cockpit to continue to train.<br><br>What for? To project a deterrence, and to prepare for a war we all hope never happens.
