            <div class='col-md body'>Well, the reality of military aviation is, there are very real risks involved and no matter how much we try to reduce them, things like this will happen, you can never achieve a zero accident rate, and the incident, I suspect, is more of the odds catching up with the RSAF rather then any real operational deficency on their part.<br></div>

The good thing is now we have daylight to help us search. There are our people on the ground now, on their way to the crash site, and airborne they've had helicopters since the crash happened last night," US Master Sergeant Alan Lewis told Channel NewsAsia by phone.<br><br>"(The terrain is) very rough, very rocky; a lot of cactus things like that nature, and very distant from many improved services such as paved roads, things of that nature."<br><br>MINDEF will be conducting an investigation to determine the cause of the crash.<br><br>The F-16 was assigned to the 56th Fighter Wing at Luke Air Force Base as part of the RSAF's Peace Carvin II detachment there. - CNA<br></div>
