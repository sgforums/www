            <div class='col-md body'>This is the X-48 Red Eagle. Its been under top secret development for many 11 years. This plane has the ability to not only reach a Mach 8 but also it can dive up to 500 feet underwater and take out submarines. If you think that is unbelievable, wait to see the people dumb enough to take this post seriously.<br><br><a href="http://media2.big-boys.com/files/planewater.wmv" rel="nofollow">http://media2.big-boys.com/files/planewater.wmv</a></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><br>http://www.stengg.com/upload/268SkRKh7T4eEUFjNcE.jpg<br><br>Squad Support Weapon (SSW)==Our own Spore weapon<br><br>""The SSW was conceptualised specifically for military operations in urban terrain (MOUT). Although the idea of a dual calibre weapon is not new, ST Kinetics' SSW is the only infantry weapon developed in Asia with a Fire Control System (FCS) that fires next generation programmable ammunition like the 40mm Air Bursting Munition (ABM) directly from a handheld system. Weighing only 6kg with a full load 4 x 40mm rounds and 20 x 5.7mm rounds, the SSW is hassle-free, intuitive to use, and short and light enough to be carried and efficiently deployed by individual soldiers even in confined spaces.<br><br>Improved Lethality<br>The SSW has a built-in miniaturised FCS for better accuracy, reliability and improved probability of a first time hit. The FCS features advanced electronics to ensure quick target acquisition and accurate delivery of fire. It helps the user to compute the range using a laser range finder, and programmes ammunition quickly and accurately. It is designed with an automatic ammunition recognition device to help overcome any human errors that might compromise safety and reliability.<br><br>In its grenade launcher mode, ST Kinetics' SSW fires existing 40mm low velocity and a new medium velocity round, ABM and conventional grenades. Medium velocity rounds offer users a longer range. Coupled with an FCS, it also offers increased accuracy. This offers an unprecedented lethality in personal defence weapons.<br><br>With an ABM capability built into a handheld system, soldiers are now equipped with greater lethality to overcome targets located in areas such as rooftops or windows beyond the reaches of conventional ammunition. The ABM is particularly effective where targets are situated in difficult or closed terrain such as bunkers and caves, as evidenced in recent world conflicts.<br><br>With its capacity for four ready 40mm rounds in the SSW, soldiers can now operate with increased confidence knowing that they can engage their targets quickly and effectively without needing to re-load after each shot. The SSW offers a high rate of grenade fire, and can operate in a single shot or semi-automatic mode for a more permanent and lethal effect. This is a crucial feature for fleeting targets in urban warfare.<br><br>In grenade launcher mode, the SSW has an effective range of up to 500m, depending on the type of ammunition selected.<br><br>Personal Defence Weapon<br>As a personal defence weapon, the SSW is customised for smaller and more powerful PDW ammunition such as 5.7mm. It can also be configured for 4.6mm PDW calibre, according to the customer's requirements. It comes with a 20 round magazine, and can engage targets of up to 200m.<br><br>Designed to combat the demands of urban warfare, ST Kinetics' SSW offers a lethal 2-in-1 combination, packed into a light weight, compact and ergonomic design.<br><br>Family of Weapons Concept<br>The SSW is built on a family of weapons concept for maximum commonality in terms of logistics and maintenance. Future variants could include a semi automatic grenade launcher using a box magazine combined with a PDW, or simply a semi automatic grenade launcher without a PDW. Designs are currently on the drawing board, and a first technical demostrator of the standard SSW is expected to be ready in 3 to 4 years' time.<br><br>Related Companies<br><br>* Singapore Technologies Kinetics Ltd (ST Kinetics),end of quote""<br><br>2.How to compare with XM29?<br><br>XM29 looks bulky.<br><br>http://world.guns.ru/assault/as40-e.htm<br><br>XM 8 was detached fr XM 29 to form on its own.<br><br>http://www.hkdefense.us/pages/military-le/rifles-carbines/xm8.html<br><br>3.I prefer SSW,looks more easy to handle.I can bet one coffee with u that SSW can be field earlier than XM28.Limited to 2 coffee.<br><br>4.We have 40mm Air Bursting Munition System (ABMS) in operation.our SAR 21 is a very good base to form SSW.<br><br>The 40mm x4 is just mated with the rifle.Does US has ABMS?<br><br>http://www.stengg.com/CoyCapPro/detail.aspx?pdid=150<br><br>5.It seems we are in par with US with small arms R and D.<br><br><img src><img src><img src><blockquote></blockquote></div>
