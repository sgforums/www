The selection citheria is not strigent enough., The interview alone wont weed out these black sheeps. But that is not for me nor anyone else but the General Manager and Ops people to decide.<br><br>On the RSAF being a flight grading squadron...True, I agree SYFC is some sort of unofficial RSAF squadron but there are many cases where a PPL from SYFC has been chopped while someone with no background on flying can get into RSAF.<br><br>I dun know about others, but for me, I have an interest in the field of aviation and i believe that getting into SYFC will further my interest in this subject.<br><br>I didnt realise a joke on the KT-1 replacing our piper warriors can turn out this kind of stuff. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"><br><br>Cheers</div>

The MCU--smaller, lighter, and more powerful than computers installed in earlier versions of the E-2C--gives the Hawkeye 2000 a cooperative engagement capability (CEC) that provides the aircraft the ability to fuse data from sensors of other platforms and distribute the information to weapon-firing platforms to permit target engagement by any platform in the net. Hawkeye 2000 also features a new cooling system and integrated satellite communications.<br><br>External differences in the Hawkeye 2000 include a steerable circular end-fire array antenna mounted on the underside of the fuselage and a conical satellite communications (SATCOM) antenna mounted atop the rotodome. (Company officials said that a shudder caused by the SATCOM antenna may require relocation of the antenna elsewhere on the aircraft.)<br><br>[/b]</blockquote>If DTG re-wrote the source code......won't they be using another MCU probably COTS (and super garang MIPS back then)?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br><br>I think the displays have been changed too....color, touchscreen etc saw a pict on a document on the Mindef website.<br><br>CEC would be a great add-on but since we are going our own way with the data-link (at least air interface) how practical will it be to integrate considering they won't give you the source code.......maybe in higher OSI layers........IP link to gateways thru SATCOM???</div>

SG Navy bought a Submarine rescue submersible (SSRV) from Kockums which will be installed on a leased vessel SS Kendricks together with decompression chamber and the whole works by 2004. SG SSRV will be utilise by friendly nations in this region to rescue any of their sunken subs.<br><br>2. Flight Magazine indicates that SG will be looking for a new Military Trainer after SG selection of the NGF. It will replace the TA-A4 based in France ( What about the 30 S211 we have in Australia, can't it be used for this role??? ). Bristish Hawk, MIG-AT130, Aermacchi and Korean T-50 are in the so called running.<br><br>3. Mystified by this info in the Weyer Naval Ships of the world - It says that SG is acquiring 4 locally built 1,000ton vessels, length is 100metres.( This got nothing to do with the Deltas and don't know how true it is?). Delivery by 2010.<br><br>4. SG Navy has acquired Kockums SAM1 unmanned mine sweepers which will be controlled from the Landsort MCM ( Bedok Class ).<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Comments on members feedback</span> :<br><br>The Bell 609 tilt rotor i was briefed was the military version, which I think will be very ideal for our Navy. It will be only available after Bell fulfilled all the civilian version back orders...say somewhere after 2015.<br><br>SG AWACs upgrade undertaken by DSTA was not to the Hawkeye 2000 variant. Ours is 1 generation behind UAE and 2 generation behind the Americans.<br><br>SG Army has acquire about 150++ LSVs, it is very unlikely that we will ever have the Spider.<br><br>...more to come</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>SYFC,...hmmm... well it brought back fond memories of my time in Junior Flying Club ( It was called by that name then ), Our Club house was in Tanglin Road ( Old CMPB). long time ago. I was Sixteen and I was training to Fly first the motorised glider and then to Cesna 172 ( A very simple and easy to fly plane ). Sadly didn't complete my PPL.<br><br></div>

Then again, does anyone have a ballpark figure how many graduates from S.211s end up as fighter pilot trainees (ie AJT at Cazaux)?</div>
