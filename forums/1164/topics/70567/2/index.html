The fare is $2 cash (no ezlink), and it includes the return trip to Expo from Changi. The bus takes approximately 20-25 mins each way.

Several had a common refrain: "We gave them a few surprises in air combat. They have begun to respect us, though we also learnt a great deal from them,'' said one, pride writ large over his face.<br><br>Six USAF F-15Cs were pitted against a range of Jaguars, MiG-21s, MiG-27s and the "fearsome" Sukhoi-30s.<br><br><strong>The exercise was meant to evaluate tactics, training and operational procedures. No senior officer from either country was willing to go on record on who scored most points. But some Indian pilots claimed the "kill ratio" was 4:1 in their favour.</strong><br><br>Air Marshal Ajit Bhavnani, who is senior Air Staff Officer at the Central Air Command, was more tempered. He said the exercise concluded with "mutual respect for each othersÂ’ skills" and that it should not be viewed as a "boxing match".<br><br><a href="http://www.hindustantimes.com/news/181_587246,0008.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.hindustantimes.com/news/181_587246,0008.htm</a></div>

They've been to every Asian Aerospace show, or nearly all.<br><br>Which was the best?<br><br>Philip: 1994. The Russian Sukhoi aircraft did a very beautiful cobra-like manoeuvre. And the United States also showed off everything it had.<br><br>Sean: 2000 - the French aerobatic team was here.<br><br>How about this year?<br><br>Jer Wei: Disappointing. The Typhoon is only a mock-up. Langkawi's airshow last year had a longer aerial display and more stunts, planes flew closer to the ground.<br><br>Sean: Too little flying. Singapore should have contributed F-16s and Skyhawks since we are the hosts.<br><br>Why come on a trade day?<br><br>Sean: The exhibitors would have kept a lot of things from the public or gone home by this weekend. Trade days aren't so crowded and I want to take close-ups of the French Rafale and Mirage fighters for my research.<br><br>Which of the three fighters on Singapore's shortlist would you pick?<br><br>Philip: Boeing's F-15. It's more rugged.<br><br>Jer Wei: Rafale. It's proven in service with the French air force and navy.<br><br>Sean: The Typhoon, if I had to choose from the three, because it's a Generation 4 fighter with a seven-tonne payload. But I'd prefer Russia's Sukhoi Su-30 Flanker. Underrated, very rugged and pure titanium.<br><br>Any tips for airshow visitors?<br><br>Jer Wei: Use sun screen. Tour the static exhibits outside in the morning or evening. Cool down in the hall in the afternoon.<br><br>Sean: Don't drive. I parked in Tampines and took a bus here. Bring a hat, binoculars, digital camera and lots of water. Watch the aerial display from Changi Beach.<br><br>Philip: Don't bring your girlfriend.<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">-- Goh Chin Lian </span><br></div>
