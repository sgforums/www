            <div class='col-md body'>No clear skies as rivals nip at air show's heels<br><br>By David Boey<br><br>ASIAN Aerospace, which ended yesterday, has grown by leaps and bounds since it started in 1981, but the air show needs to re-examine its game plan to avoid sliding back to its humble beginnings.<br><br>It made its debut on a fringe of Paya Lebar Airport with 230 exhibitors and 4,000 trade visitors.<br><br>Fast-forward 23 years and the organisers say a record US$3.52 billion (S$6 billion) worth of deals were sealed during the four trade days of the show this year, attended by more than 23,500 trade visitors.<br><br>Over the weekend, when it was opened to the public, a projected 40,000 people were expected to attend.<br><br>On the international air show circuit, the Singapore event is seen as the third most important, after the Paris Air Show and Farnborough International in Britain. This year's show, the 12th, was anchored by 758 exhibitors from 33 countries.<br><br>At first glance, these figures indicate the air show has charted an impressive growth path. Asian Aerospace president Ed Ng is confident it will continue to grow, as the centre of gravity for air travel moves to Asia over the next 20 to 30 years.<br><br>But it's not all clear skies ahead.<br><br>Continuing consolidation of the world's aviation and defence sectors has shrunk the pool of potential exhibitors.<br><br>With leaner advertising and promotional budgets, these exhibitors must pick and choose where they exhibit and how much space they can pay for.<br><br>Just as Changi Airport and Singapore Airlines ponder their relevance amid mounting competition, the people behind Asian Aerospace would do well not to rest on their laurels.<br><br>Regional shows such as the Langkawi International Maritime and Aerospace (Lima) show in Malaysia, Dubai Air Show in the United Arab Emirates (UAE), and Avalon Air Show in Australia have been nipping at Asian Aerospace's heels.<br><br>Alternatives abound on the circuit though some events, such as those in the Philippines, South Korea and Taiwan, play to the home crowd.<br><br>Though Asian Aerospace has had a decade's head start, Lima has seen the number of exhibitors more than triple from 150 in 1991 to over 500 last September. The Dubai show, held for only the eighth time last December, pulled in more than 500 exhibitors and more than 30,000 trade visitors.<br><br>Air show exhibitors need several months' lead time to plan their presence and to ship bulky equipment to the site by sea. With three shows held almost back to back within six months, some exhibitors at Asian Aerospace are suggesting it might be worthwhile for Singapore and Malaysia to take turns hosting one 'big show' every two years.<br><br>Otherwise Asian Aerospace and Lima may cannibalise each other's markets as companies groan under air show fatigue.<br><br>In Europe, the Paris and Farnborough shows - held since the early days of the aeroplane - dominate the air show scene and are held in alternate years. Industry watchers say the biennial Berlin Air Show, restarted in 1992 after German reunification, has had a tough time trying to upstage Paris and Farnborough.<br><br>Competition has already seen the departure of events like the Indonesia Air Show, last held in Jakarta in 1996.<br><br>In Singapore, defence shows like Electronics for National Security Asia (last held in the mid-1980s) and Defence Asia (last held in 1997) have been scuppered for lack of industry support.<br><br>Singapore's attentiveness to security threats, good infrastructure and its air-hub status make a compelling case for the aviation industry to roost here.<br><br>Even the weather is in Singapore's favour. That Asian Aerospace is held in February is an attraction to Europeans and Americans looking for a sunny escape from winter weather and when the show ends, many will head home with new tan lines.<br><br>MORE WORK NEEDED<br><br>THE jury is still out, however, on whether the unprecedented number of conferences scheduled for Asian Aerospace 2004 - five this time around - brought more trade visitors to the air show or siphoned them away from the Changi show site.<br><br>There are several areas where more work is needed.<br><br>This year, the flight lines at the air show featured 50 different aircraft, fewer than in previous years.<br><br>To be sure, non-trade visitors who swarm around the booths clamouring for souvenirs can be a nuisance, but some companies - particularly aircraft makers - know that winning crowd appeal goes some way towards making their planes more marketable.<br><br>This explains the expensive freebies, such as posters and pins, these companies rolled out over the weekend.<br><br>If the public days drew not just locals but also tourists, the stronger turnout would bring spin-offs to other sectors, including the hotel and retail trade.<br><br>Britain's International Air Tattoo, held during the Farnborough show, has evolved into a tourist magnet because aviation fans are drawn to its status as the world's best military air show. Its warplane line-up stretches 3km and it puts on eight hours' worth of flying displays. Every two years, some 200,000 people throng the Royal Air Force base at Fairford - about a two-hour drive from London - over a weekend to see the event.<br><br>The need to close Changi Airport to scheduled flights while the 90-minute air displays are staged means that display time at Asian Aerospace is tight. But there's ample space on the tarmac to show off additional warbirds.<br><br>A line-up of warplanes from Asean air forces, for instance, would lift the show's appeal by offering a display that few would otherwise get a chance to see. This year, there was not even a single aircraft from the Republic of Singapore Air Force.<br><br>Hopefully, the decision announced at the start of the air show - to move the air and defence show to a brand new home at a larger, better-equipped exhibition centre at Changi North in 2008 - has not come too late, considering that, when talk of such a move first surfaced, the site was to have been ready for the 1998 air show.<br><br>Asian Aerospace has established itself as a top regional show. The trick is to hold onto that reputation because rival events in Malaysia and the UAE are eagerly eyeing those bragging rights.<br><br><a href="http://straitstimes.asia1.com.sg/storyprintfriendly/0,1887,237731,00.html?" rel="nofollow">http://straitstimes.asia1.com.sg/storyprintfriendly/0,1887,237731,00.html?</a></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Viper52, your words should be written in to the straits times or something. i am too, really very dissapointed by this year's airshow. it really sucks.  but here, noone will see our opinions. to be honest, i felt i totally wasted my 21bucks. even though i'm a total aviation enthusiast, it did not satisfy me one bit. the worst was sunday, which had the most ppl. most of the ppl there went to the static display after the aerial display, but to our dissapointment, half the planes were gone. only the F15 was left. the rest had either left or taxied back to the big plane area. not many ppl knew and not many bothered because the queue simply didn't move. moveover, cameras were not allowed there. i told my friends about the nice dump and burn by the aussies, but it never materialised when i brought them there. so many people were complaining when i was there at the static display. even though this is typical s'porean behaviour, i had to agree with them that this show was very badly organised and sucked.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Went to AA04 on 28th Feb. Dressed in Business attire, got alot of attention. Collected alot of brochures and free magazines. Spoke to exhibitors and got response as well as info from mags as follows :<br><br>1.  SG will we acquiring the JSF F-35s from 2014 onwards to replace some of the F-16s with in-turn are replacing our F-5s<br>2. Our F5s will be replaced by F-16C Block 52 from our own inventory in the future.<br>2. Boeing very confidently saying that the F15T will be selected by our Air Force ( Praying very hard that it is not the truth ).<br>3. Korea will be selling 20 KT1A trainer to SG ( Is this the SF260W replacement ??? and do we need this???).<br>4. SG will be buying totally a new plane to replace our AWACs instead of upgrading.<br>5. SG has Long Shot.<br>6. SG will be acquiring a few C-130J transports to replace our older Hercules.<br>7. SG current ship-borne Harpoons will be retroffited with state of the art Harpoon Block 2 technology.<br>8. After listening to my client Bell on their review of the Bell609 tilt-rotor, I felt SG should acquire it.<br>9. ST exhibitors were dumbfounded by my inquisitive questioning.<br>10. Saw the LSV Spider and a new section support weapon, very impressive. Attended Fan-tail demostration.<br>11.Heard the Brahmos Anti-ship supersonic missile is being offered to Malaysia for their SU-30MK.<br><br>More to come....if you guys are interested.<br><br>(All the above info were available from Brochures &amp; Magazines acquired during the AA04 and I did not divulged any secrets... Phew!)<br></div>

Similar case with the Bv206 and the Bronco. Not much visual differences to my eye. But OEM ourselves...we can customise and produce as many as we like.<br><br><blockquote><br>The E-2C has just undergone an upgrade. Wont an upgrade to Hawkeye 2000 standard be more economical? Read from AFM that only RSAF and former IDF/AF E-2C have refuelling capability.</blockquote>I believe I read that DTG rewrote the entire source code or something....make it smaller and easier to maintain. More importantly, gives it the ability to update the threat library anytime.<br><br>Not much info on the upgrade, as mindef thrown a big blanket of security over it, and is best remain that way. But I am sure being Singaporeans, we sure KS and cramp a lot of interesting items inside... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br><br>Article on what I can find on the E2C upgrade.<br><a href="http://www.ainonline.com/Publications/asian/asian_02/asn_d102_sporeopenspg2.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.ainonline.com/Publications/asian/asian_02/asn_d102_sporeopenspg2.html</a><br><br><strong>Quoting from website</strong><br>http://www.navyleague.org/seapower/navy_gives_northrup_grumman_gree.htm<br><br>The Hawkeye 2000 improvements include a mission computer upgrade (MCU), based on commercial-off-the-shelf technology, that features the use of advanced control indicator sets (ACISs) for workstations. The MCU--smaller, lighter, and more powerful than computers installed in earlier versions of the E-2C--gives the Hawkeye 2000 a cooperative engagement capability (CEC) that provides the aircraft the ability to fuse data from sensors of other platforms and distribute the information to weapon-firing platforms to permit target engagement by any platform in the net. Hawkeye 2000 also features a new cooling system and integrated satellite communications.<br><br>External differences in the Hawkeye 2000 include a steerable circular end-fire array antenna mounted on the underside of the fuselage and a conical satellite communications (SATCOM) antenna mounted atop the rotodome. (Company officials said that a shudder caused by the SATCOM antenna may require relocation of the antenna elsewhere on the aircraft.)<br><br></div>
