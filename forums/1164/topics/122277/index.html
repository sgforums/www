            <div class='col-md body'>The hovercraft is one big target! The only defence it got is maybe its speed and maybe small arms cover on board such as from GPMG or SAW. I saw the British hovercrafts before,theirs are much smaller. Their marines will ride shotgun by proning down with weapons pointing to the front,on the sides of the craft as it charges towards the beach for an assault. If you ask me takes one hell of a ride! <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>To be fair to ST Marine &amp; the RSN, unless the Hovercrafts are 'well-armed' for its own defence and offence(?), it will be just another 'easy meat' for any hostile forces.<br><br>But PLEASSSEeeee, don't just equiped them with GPMGs!   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_sad.gif" alt="Sad" title="Sad">   Such weapons are good for morale for the crew (esp, with the GPMGs firing) but they are practically useless against attacks from aerial attacks or even small anti-ship missiles such as EXOCET-class missiles.<br><br>At least the Russian ZUBR hovercrafts liked more self-assuring, a couple of CIWS (such as KHASTAN-type) can give the hovercraft a very nasty shock to any potential hostile attack.
