            <div class='col-md body'>I ask this question because many actors and actressers happen to be merely that: actors and actresses.  People who are unable to do anything else, much less think rationally, but yet are entrusted with a wide public recognition and are generally heard by the rest of the public.<br><br>In times of unrest like this, instead of supporting their own country's war effort many of the no-good-lousy-layabout actors and actresses are opening the bloody-big-fat-and-full-of-shit mouths to speak against the US war effort while US soldiers are dying and getting injured in Iraq.<br><br>The worry I have here should not be about whether the Oscars will appear to glitzy and frivlous or not; It always does.  However, our worry in such a time is that the ill-informed 'stars' of hollywood are expressing their view points which do not serve any good.  And when I say they are ill-informed, they are ill-informed y choice and not by option.  Many of them equate peace as US being in the wrong to start the war with Iraq.<br><br>In fact, they are not the only ones who equate peace as such, but many others around the globe as well.<br><br>My stand is that every sane person wants peace, where people differ is on how it should come about.  I do not think it right that anti-war protestors demand peace in the form of US pulling out of Iraq and stopping with the war.  My view of peace is that of stability of the world in the from of fewer WMD in the hands of single political figures AND better life for the oppressed.<br><br>The point here is that being sane is very different from being rational.  Being rational includes not only the ability to control ones actions and adjust to surroundings, but also the ability to think and act accordingly.  In this case, I believe the US is certainly right to go to war and that it is extremely irresponsible of the Academy to hold the Academy Awards at a time when so many of the 'stars' are foolishly pitting themselves against change for a better world.  The stars should just shut up, wake up their bloody idea and get back into the obscured and very different world in which they live in and leave real world matters to real world people.  Not everything in the world follows a goddamn script.<br><br>my two cents</div>
