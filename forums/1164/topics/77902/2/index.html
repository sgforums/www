            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by SpecOps87:</div><div class="quote_body">Actually,the thing here is comparing the Spectre and A-10 Warthog,it all depends on the mission role it is on.I will not deny the fact that Warthogs are superb in tank-busting and bunker busting,but we have to bare in mind the fact that the guided missiles on board is accurate to 6 ft.However a 105mm gun in the Spectre which can do an equally good job at takin out buildings,bunker busting and busting light armoured vehicles read LIGHT ARMOURED VEHICLES like APCs,IFVs,not MBTS or tank busting,the Spectre can deleiver spot-on accurate fire.Thats why its use its commonly limited to the SpecWar community.And correct me if I'm wrong,only the US uses this so called "Aerial Artillery" such as Spooky from the Vietnam Era to the Spectre currently still in service.<br><br>The choice of a Spectre over a chopper can be asnwered anytime due to th fact that a chopper's endurance over the combat area is limited.While the Spectre can be refueled in mid-air and can carry a substantial amount of ordance in the air.Think about it,how many Hellfire missiles and 30mm rounds can a Apache carry?For ground suppression,it can carry only 16 Hellfires,and 1,200 30mm rounds.And take the A-10 Warthog for example,yes sure it can get the job done.But is the pilot able to deliever accurate 30mm fire on a single pass moving low and fast?I bet not,and though it can be refeulled in mid-air,however it cannot carry the same amount of ordance.Thus,the RSAF should form a of Squardon of Spectres as it will really scare the balls of any aggressor once they witness the hard-hitting fire power which can tear buildings apart.</div></blockquote>Can we afford to have 18 Ac-130 gunship instead of 18 Apache? Yes ,the ammo it carry by one is more than enough to fill up the 18 apache ammo but can one or two AC-130 gunship carry out multi-tasking at the same time,different location compare to four groups of Apache with four each. Enemy isn't going to just strike at one place and send out one concentrate army in war.Unless u say we can afford 18 AC-130 gunship! Spore don't have the financial to afford a complete squadron of these gunship!</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>yeah,the Spectre is one vulnerable piece of metal considering its intended role of providing close air support.can only deploy it if you have air superiority and no threats of sams.basically useful onli for blasting the hell out of helpless infantry with no manpads.even darkness is no protection against manportable heat seeking missiles. Definitely not a piece of machinery for singapore.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Just like to remind everyone to take a step backward and look at a wider picture.<br><br>The C130 has been the work horse for a lot of the world air forces, been flying a lot of mission in and out of trouble areas, a lot of them been shot at by guns and missiles before. It have proven itself to be a very good plane. Please be reminded, there is anti-missile system that can be fixed on board. So expect the spectre to have the best anti-missile system on board too.<br><br>Just because a spectre have been shot down, after years of operation, does not mean that it is not a suitable or good aircraft. Remember there are F18s, F16s, F15s and apaches shoot down in war by guns or missile also but that does not mean they are not good. There is alway some losses, due to bad luck, unsuitable situation of usage. If you don't have air superiority, even asking a F15 to go alone to do bombing run well end up being shot down.<br><br>Be fair to the spectre, it is still a proven plane with endurance to fly and provide sustained firepower from air like no other planes can. Any countries will be more than willing to have sure a wonderful weapon on their side, provided budget allows.</div>
