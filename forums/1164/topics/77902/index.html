            <div class='col-md body'>Hi,was just doing some research.But,anyone have any opinions or comments if the RSAF should include Spectre Gunships in their arsernal?Given the fact that the conflickts these days take place in urban areas.And it is to provide a form of ground support for the troops and vehicles on the ground,Spectres can be called in to unleash their,105mm guns,40mm guns,or even the 7.62mm miniguns.Its literally a flying orbiting piece of artillery which can hold off enemy ground troops indefinitely and yet take out buildings which enemy troops are occupied in.<br><br>Please do feel free to add your comments and remarks.Thanks  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by SpecOps87:</div><div class="quote_body">Actually is both sides got weapons stickin out.</div></blockquote>No, its only on one side, the left (port) side. The concept of the gunship was borne out of the Vietnam war, where a slow-flying aircraft will circle a spot in a 30 degree (IIRC) angle of bank with guns firing out of the side. Theoretically, if the angle of bank is maintained, it'll be able to fire on the same spot to provide continuous fire support.<br><br>It not feasible for RSAF, while the firepower is amazing, it will require outright air supeiority to use. It is also terribly vulnerable, as demonstrated in Desert Storm, when one AC-130 with 14 crew was lost after it stayed in the AO after the break of dawn and was shot down by a SAM.</div>

Had they really been gung-ho and risked a multi-million dollar aircraft without a better reason than wanting plink a few more Iraqi tanks, the entire crew would have got their collective asses in the shitter<br><br><blockquote>At 0600 hours on the morning of January 31, "Spirit 03" was the last of three AC-130 Spectre gunships on station to provide close air support for the embattled Marines on the ground. Spirit 03 was due to end its patrol when it received a call from the Marines - they needed an enemy missile battery destroyed. Despite the risk of anti-aircrarft artillery fire, and the greater danger of the morning sun casting light on the circling gunship, the crew of "Spirit 03" chose to remain and destroy the position requested.<br><br>Soon after eliminating the target designated by the Marines, a lone Iraqi hoisted an SA-7 "Grail" manportable surface-to-air missile to his shoulder. In the dawn of the early morning light, the form of the large AC-130 slowly became visible in the skies over Khafji. The decision to remain behind to support the Marines cost the pilots and crew of Spirit 03 their best defensive weapon - darkness. The Iraqi pointed the weapon at the aircraft, and fired. The missile found its target and at 0635 hours the aircraft sent out a "mayday" distress call and then crashed into the waters of the Persian Gulf. All 14 crewmembers were killed.</blockquote><a href="http://www.specialoperations.com/Memorial/spirit.html" rel="nofollow">Link: Battle of Khafji and Spirit 03's shootdown</a><br><br>Its a useful thing to have no doubt, but not if your enemy has anything remotely like half-decent AD oppostion around that is able to keep your own side from achieving complete air dominance.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Actually,the thing here is comparing the Spectre and A-10 Warthog,it all depends on the mission role it is on.I will not deny the fact that Warthogs are superb in tank-busting and bunker busting,but we have to bare in mind the fact that the guided missiles on board is accurate to 6 ft.However a 105mm gun in the Spectre which can do an equally good job at takin out buildings,bunker busting and busting light armoured vehicles read LIGHT ARMOURED VEHICLES like APCs,IFVs,not MBTS or tank busting,the Spectre can deleiver spot-on accurate fire.Thats why its use its commonly limited to the SpecWar community.And correct me if I'm wrong,only the US uses this so called "Aerial Artillery" such as Spooky from the Vietnam Era to the Spectre currently still in service.<br><br>The choice of a Spectre over a chopper can be asnwered anytime due to th fact that a chopper's endurance over the combat area is limited.While the Spectre can be refueled in mid-air and can carry a substantial amount of ordance in the air.Think about it,how many Hellfire missiles and 30mm rounds can a Apache carry?For ground suppression,it can carry only 16 Hellfires,and 1,200 30mm rounds.And take the A-10 Warthog for example,yes sure it can get the job done.But is the pilot able to deliever accurate 30mm fire on a single pass moving low and fast?I bet not,and though it can be refeulled in mid-air,however it cannot carry the same amount of ordance.Thus,the RSAF should form a of Squardon of Spectres as it will really scare the balls of any aggressor once they witness the hard-hitting fire power which can tear buildings apart.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Ah... one aircraft grunts learn to appreciate. History dates back to the Vietnam War and the good'ol "Puff the Magic Dragon".<br><br>As it is said before, grunts love them but for the crew, its is hell because they know  they are vunerable.<br><br>Spectre is set to get even more deadlier. Its replacement is supposed to recieve a COIL laser unit. Talk abt firepower.<br><br>But this is classified as a heavy offensive unit. No way our political leadership will buy them and it does not fit into SAF doctrine.</div>
