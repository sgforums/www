              <p>Agree with you on this.... Our Singapore guys arent physically fit these days. and loyalty isnt really there too...

(Australia or New Zealand next?)<br><br>I guess if we have mercenaries from China coming in and saving guys from 2 years of NS, probably view on PRC foreign talents would be a lot different than it is now.</p>

              Even if possible, there is no benefit to taking back Singapore. It will only add to racial tensions in Malaysia and undermine the political structure within Malaysia.
              
              Malaysia is still very much inter-linked with the outside world. It still needs export markets for its oil revenues and manufacturing production. Invading Singapore only serves to isolate Malaysia. Having enjoyed the living standards of an open economy, asking its citizens to renounce that for the sake of a resourceless Singapore is political suicide.
              
              The issue of "loyalty" doesn't even arise.

              <p><br>i am not updated really. so Tibet now belongs to china or not? HongKong. walkover after 1997. No army. lots of gangs and criminals, the movies even glorifyies it. so lots of cops. but cops can battle streetwars, not countyr wars. The chinese always wannted to kick some japanese arse, but...japnese still has an army fo defecne (after ww2) and lucky for them if some of their people scorned, thy have US. Taiwan has afucking small army as compared to china. a small fucking one that can bite if china wants to walk in by land. during ww2 japanese find invading malaya much a breeze as compared to singapore. although singapor was small but we put up a much better g=fight and show. we could have held on longer and make more pages in tthe history of japnese invasion of the small island if it wasn't for shortage of war hardware. no battleships to defend our seas, poor untrained comoners, mixed race soldiers. people claim that we should point our guns inland since there is a chance that the japs will take a direct approcah via johore, but standing in the point of britisjh commanders then what is the pint of doing that? beside charging at the enmy with rifles and bayonet the range of those gun can hardly hit any japanese targets. theywere better pointed at the sea just. it willmake some history if they can take donw any japnese warships entering form that channel. even if a country is neutral, that does not mean that she need not have a regular army.</p>

              can maintain peace with every other country (except for Malaysia

              SAF and save on financial resources which can be used for economic
              development. And all males can save 1.5 years and graduate from
              University or enter the workforce quickly. Imagine how much more
              money you can earn in those 1.5 years?! In the post WWII era, no
              one will go for any land or air combat anymore except for America
              against the Middle East. Has any Asian country broken into a war in
              recent years (Not counting the Vietnam War, and that was America's
              problem again)? Neutrality means no army (like Liechtenstein), and
              means more resources for the development of the country! Look at
              Liechtenstein, it has the world's highest GDP (PPP) per capita!</p>

              <p>Yuh huh.  The best defence is a good offense, especially when you don't have defensive depth.  If things go belly-up, it would be really handy to have Johor as Singapore's version of the Golan Heights.</p>

              <p>I really think I was referring to strategic objectives.  Our goal is defensive in nature.  Of course, the military's strategy to achieving defense is through offensive operations.  </p>
              <p>This reflects a "Defensive realist" theoretical perspective where a state arms up "sufficiently" to deter threats.  "Sufficiently" is allowed a degree of ambiguity towards quantitative and qualitative interpretation.</p>
              <p>The reverse, which I was trying to dispel, was that of "offensive realism" where a state arms up and continues to do so, so that it can seek to secure itself through maximizing its power (ie. owning most of the power).</p>
              <p>In the case of South East Asia, Singapore does possess a significant majority of military power in balanced quantitative - qualitative terms.  So offensive realism can say that we secure ourselves vis a vis malaysia and indonesia via overwhelming military capabilities.  However, from a defensive realist perspective, I am saying that we are not actually capable of completely capturing and annexing Malaysia, let alone Indonesia.  Hence, our military force is only "sufficient" at promising extremely devastating punches to deter any potential threat from them and thus, our strategic objective is defensive in nature; structured to deter. </p>
