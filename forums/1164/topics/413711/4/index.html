              gulf war. it was finished in a matter of weeks with the UN
              airforce. already, our airforce and navy easily dwarfs that of
              malaysia and indonesia combined. when war comes, its no longer what
              Truman said "how many divisions have you?" its "how many missiles
              have you? how powerful are they?" </p>
              <p>the very reason why malaysia still bothers to sell us water and
              indonesia doesnt bother us is because of our war capacity.
              look at history. the indonesian commando-cum-terroirsts? the time
              malaysia almost went to war with indonesia last year? how much more
              with us the moment they see our forces are weak! the ASEAN isnt a
              back-up card ppl, look at her members! all smiling islamic faces,
              underneath all eager to see singapore go down and become islamic
              like them.</p>
              <p>we can scrap NS like u ask, but then what? u defend? u know how
              to use a gun? ok, maybe the def budget is too high, but if PAP cuts
              it by half like u say, i tell u, singapore will be attacked the
              verry next day.</p>
              <p>dun try using the UNO either. the US is on the other side of the
              world, and history has shown us so many times how in competent the
              UNO has been.</p>

              <p>Don't know why soldiers should be carrying 100 kg weights. Soldiers shouldn't be bogged down with too much gear unless its body armour.</p>
              <p>As usual, such devices are generally prohibitively expensive. Can probably buy a few 3 tonner for every hulc.</p>

              <p>If we are to hold this true, then it would mean that all forms of extremism is caused by another. Extremism itself i believe is caused by insecurity. Insecurity makes one arm themselves. Another country feels insecure of the presence of arms, hence they too arm themselves more powerfully...it never ends..</p>

              <p>Your words on humanity is based on the way you think it to be..You believe god made us in his image. Yet you said we are a disease. Doesn't it then reflect negatively on god's image as the so called cause of this disease?</p>
