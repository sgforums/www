              <p>I've reminded him of the religious sensitivities, and that he apologized for it already.  By digging up an already "settled" issue, you are adding fuel to a doused flame and will only exacerbate emotions over a sensitive issue.  </p>
              <p>Under the Sedition Act, an act that has seditious tendency is also defined as.</p>

              <p> </p>
              <p>The TS has apologized over his indiscretion, which I have duly reminded, further argument over it will only serve to promote feelings of ill-will and hostility between users of various religious beliefs here.  </p>
              <p>I appreciate your efforts to point out such insensitive remarks, but that has already been dealt with.</p>
              <p>Lets keep this discussion on track.  Its a good topic to understand Singapore's position and why it hasn't sought absolute neutrality.  </p>
