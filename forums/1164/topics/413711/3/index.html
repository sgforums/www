              <p>Switzerland is a Neutral Country.  Once a German general was at a Swiss county shooting competition.  He asked what happens if there is a million man army at the Switzerland door step.  His host said every one will fire one shot and go home.</p>
              <p>The German persisted what about a 2 million man army.  His host said everyone will fire two shots and go home.</p>
              <p>Every citizen is armed and then some more.</p>
              <p>In another words.  Swizterland is a neutral country.  But that doesn't there isn't an army.   IMHO if you are neutral, you need a bigger armed forces.  Especially since you are not taking sides.</p>

              Yup. Not many people realise that not only Switzerland had an army but it had to use that army to defend itself on several occasions. It used fortifications and terrain as force multipliers.
              
              This included a complete mobilisation in world war 1&amp;2 for obvious reasons which deterred German invasion on both instances.
              
              The Swiss also boasts the 2nd largest conscript force per capita mobilised after the Israelis.
              
              It is naive to think that disbanding the army will provide peace. History teaches the opposite. The stronger the army, the less likely war will occur.

              <blockquote>Foreign policy also had to accommodate the views of
              predominantly Islamic neighbors who were viewed by
              Singapore's
              leaders as possible threats to its existence. As a gesture
              toward
              its neighbors and in recognition of its own regional
              roots,
              Singapore maintained its membership in the <strong><em><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Nonaligned
              Movement</span></em></strong>,
              although it consistentl<strong><em><span style="text-decoration: underline;">y rejected neutrality a</span></em></strong>s a foreign
              policy
              option. Singapore's leaders had reasoned that avoiding
              entanglements with the great powers would leave Singapore
              far too
              vulnerable to threats from regional neighbors, as
              Indonesia's
              Confrontation campaign had demonstrated. Neutrality also
              was
              perceived to be inconsistent with the Total Defence style
              of
              defensive vigilance that the PAP attempted to instill in
              the
              citizenry following the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan and
              the
              Vietnamese occupation of Cambodia......</blockquote>

              The discussion about NS is separate from that of defence.
              
              NS conscription can be a dated concept. In the Iraq war (Iraqi freedom), a conscript army was swept away by a force a few times smaller but more technologically advanced.
              
              NS today should not be the same NS as in the 1970s. Today's warfare demands high technology thinking soldiers (but still equally committed). A smaller force is far easier to equip more thoroughly than a larger force but it cannot be too small that it cannot handle threats. If NS today is still like NS in the 1970s, we are also gone case if we meet a higher tech aggressor.
              
              The question is whether the investment in NS can be put to more efficient use elsewhere. The Government appears to be ensuring that NS is kept relevant as a key platform for defending Singapore. Having said that, it is not unreasonable to consider the efficiency of NS every once in a while.

              <p>Nice. In fact Lockheed martin already has something in the market called "hulc".</p>

              <p>Don't know why soldiers should be carrying 100 kg weights. Soldiers shouldn't be bogged down with too much gear unless its body armour.</p>
              <p>As usual, such devices are generally prohibitively expensive. Can probably buy a few 3 tonner for every hulc.</p>

              <p>in the first place, as i said, in this mordern world, its not the size that matters anymore, dun u guys understand? look at the gulf war. it was finished in a matter of weeks with the UN airforce. already, our airforce and navy easily dwarfs that of malaysia and indonesia combined. when war comes, its no longer what Truman said "how many divisions have you?" its "how many missiles have you? how powerful are they?" </p>
              <p>the very reason why malaysia still bothers to sell us water and indonesia doesnt bother us is because of our war capacity. look at history. the indonesian commando-cum-terroirsts? the time malaysia almost went to war with indonesia last year? how much more with us the moment they see our forces are weak! the ASEAN isnt a back-up card ppl, look at her members! all smiling islamic faces, underneath all eager to see singapore go down and become islamic like them.</p>
              <p>we can scrap NS like u ask, but then what? u defend? u know how to use a gun? ok, maybe the def budget is too high, but if PAP cuts it by half like u say, i tell u, singapore will be attacked the verry next day.</p>
              <p>dun try using the UNO either. the US is on the other side of the world, and history has shown us so many times how in competent the UNO has been.</p>

              <p><br>Nice suite but still not as advanced as what i thought</p>
              <p>kekekeke...think nia</p>
              <p>still, it is a basic platform for advanced suites</p>
              <p>for portability, it is best if packed into a suitcase</p>
              <p>for highly destructive weapons, provide modular attachments that can be sent via air drops</p>
