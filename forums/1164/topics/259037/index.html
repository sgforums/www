            <div class='col-md body'>The French, for some obscene reason, are the unluckiest bunch on any battlefield. Thoroughly screwed in WW1 and WW2, and lost plenty of battles in history. The best and furtherest they have gone is under Napoleon, only to have been defeated by the British on the seas, and finally on the land. To then add insult to injury, the Brits have a statue of Rear Admiral Horatio Nelson right at the Eurotrain station at Trafalgar square. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br>Surrender monkeys or not, they certainly lose more than half the time.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by zenden9:</div><div class="quote_body">The british are lucky to count themselves having a english channel seperate them from Mainland Europe.<br><br>If substitute the position of French and British in WWII. British will have the same fate as French. German is too strong in Land War and their new doctrine and strategy is superior in the initial of the WWII. To blame the French as lousy is absurd. </div></blockquote>France, and Britain were the reigning power in Western Europe.<br><br>France especially, as it was their turf. All their men and equipment were there.<br><br>And the French were a very big and substantial army. That they were not as powerful as the Germans were already a sign of their weakness of will. Germany was quite broke after WW1, was under arms buildup control and yet they were able to surpass the French in armaments.<br><br>And they are next door to each other. How can the French not know of a arms buildup? If they did not bother to check on Germany, it is again a weakness of their part.<br><br>Take for example us in SE Asia. Singapore would never let Malaysia or Indonesia have a more powerful military force than us. To let them overtake us will be a sign of complacency or weakness of will.<br><br>It was a published fact that France had more and better tanks than Germany at the start of the war. They just didn't know how to emply them.<br><br>The British had an Expeditionary Force on Mainland Europe. But you're right, the Brits also made the same mistakes and were as weak as the French and luckily they had the Channel to escape back to.<br><br>But the quality of the Brit soldier had never been in doubt. These people had fought on nearly everyone in every part of the world since history and are known to be mostly good fighters.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>The thing is...its with the attitudes of the youths in France man. No sense of national pride, nor patriotism. Granted that they are not some communist fanatical country, but really, I spoke to the French exchange student whom introduced me to another 2 of his peers here,their sentiments are exactly that of their friend. I did ask them about the FFL and they went "Fark...those guys are crazy man. They can't fit into our society" which I'm quite stunned to hear. I won't say that of someone whom doesn't belong to my country but is willing to put his/her life on the line for me just to let me sleep peacefully at night man.</div>
