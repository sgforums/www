            <div class='col-md body'><span style="color: darkred;">Managed to catch this latest 3 series on Speed (9-10pm) this evening.<br><br>It showcase how multinational AF came togather to train in US Red flag and profiles on Operation Maple Flag training.<br><br>The interesting part is it featured RSAF F16D contingent which was involved in the Red Flag segment. One RSAF jockey is "Capt Kenneth" who narrator says is a 1st timer in Red Flag and hence a USAF pilot accompanies him in the F16D backseat in his 1st time in huge scale exercise.<br><br>Don't know I heard that right, but the narrator mentioned after the trainig results of the RSAF was impressive, which includes going up against F16 Aggressors and opfor simulated SA11 SAMs. The RSAF F16s playing escorts were able to down "6 opfor jets" during that single the exercise.<br><br>Not bad for these new groups of pilots.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br><br>Other flights in the package group inc Gemany F4(SEAD) and CF-18 (strike) </span><br><br></div>

This isn't our show. I think the fact that RSAF pilots are selected to join the operation is a recognition of our professionalism. The exposure gained by our pilots in such an operation cannot be gained anywhere else in the world. I am sure all these experience will be shared with other RSAF pilots.<br><br>As for other arms of the SAF, our soldiers are trained in many areas and have gained quite some achievement.<br><br>Ultimately, whether we are up to grade to win a war will depend on our morale to fight, the leaderships to gel the various unit into one formidable fighting force.<br><br>So far so good, I believe our defence money is well spent.</div>
