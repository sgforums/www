              <p><strong>MOH to launch two new community-based mental health
              initiatives</strong><br> <em>Posted: 12 November 2012 1930 hrs</em></p>
              <p>Minister of State for Health Dr Amy Khor announced in Parliament
              on Monday two new community-based mental health initiatives
              designed to improve Singaporeans' access to mental
              healthcare.<br> <br> "We are developing Assessment and Shared Care Teams (ASCAT), which
              are specialist-led mental health teams based in the community, in
              order to improve access to mental health care. We are also
              developing Community Mental Health Intervention Teams (COMIT) to
              provide improved access to counselling and psychotherapy services
              in the community," said Dr Khor.<br> <br> Dr Khor also said that the Institute of Mental Health's (IMH)
              occupancy rate for the past three years averaged at about 80 per
              cent and that the hospital has sufficient capacity for new
              patients.<br> <br> There are currently about 2,000 beds across public hospitals in
              Singapore dedicated to mental health patients, with the majority in
              IMH.<br> <br> Responding to queries from Member of Parliament Mr Hri Kumar Nair
              on the criteria for admitting patients to IMH, Dr. Khor said those
              with conditions such as schizophrenia and depression may be
              admitted for closer monitoring.</p>

                  services at Singapore General Hospital (SGH) Ms Esther Lim
                  steps in to help them make sense of what is happening.</span></strong></p>

                  patients may have tried to take their own lives or showed signs of
                  wanting to do so. Ms Lim also helps families cope when they have
                  lost a loved one.</span></p>
              <p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 8px; margin-bottom: 12px;"><span style="background-color: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0);">The
                  39-year-old's helping hand is extended not just to patients, but
                  also to hospital staff who face challenges at home or at work, for
                  instance, if they have been abused by a patient.</span></p>
              <p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 8px; margin-bottom: 12px;"><span style="background-color: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0);">In 2003,
                  she pioneered a programme in SGH to train health-care and social
                  work professionals in suicide intervention. It is now also offered
                  in SingHealth's Postgraduate Allied Health Training
                  Institute.</span></p>
              <p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 8px; margin-bottom: 12px;"><span style="background-color: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0);">Since
                  becoming a social worker in 1995, Ms Lim, who leads a team of 85
                  medical social workers, has received more than 15 awards. Last
                  year, she was one of two recipients of the Outstanding Social
                  Worker Awards given out by the Singapore Association of Social
                  Workers.</span></p>

                  working in the emergency department years ago, I saw how a crisis,
                  such as a life-threatening illness, a serious road traffic accident
                  or an attempted suicide, can throw a family off balance.</span></p>
              <p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 8px; margin-bottom: 12px;"><span style="background-color: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0);">The sense
                  of disbelief and loss can be overwhelming, so this is where I step
                  in to help people make sense of what is happening.</span></p>
              <p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 8px; margin-bottom: 12px;"><span style="background-color: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0);">The
                  immediate goal is to reduce the intensity of the emotional,
                  physical and behavioural reactions, while the long-term goal is to
                  help families get back to as normal a life as can be.</span></p>
              <p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 8px; margin-bottom: 12px;"><strong style="background-color: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0);">A

                  not mentally ill. Anyone facing a seemingly desperate situation can
                  be vulnerable to feeling hopeless and helpless, which may escalate
                  to suicidal acts if the person does not receive help or cuts
                  himself off from others.</span></p>
              <p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 8px; margin-bottom: 12px;"><strong style="background-color: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0);">If I were

                  to connect the suicidal person with the resources around him, such
                  as family service centres, care facilities and legal aid. Often, a
                  person may think nobody can help him, which is not true.</span></p>
              <p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 8px; margin-bottom: 12px;"><span style="background-color: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0);">The
                  eventual goal is to reconnect the suicidal person with his family
                  and loved ones through individual, couple or family
                  sessions.</span></p>
              <p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 8px; margin-bottom: 12px;"><strong style="background-color: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0);">A typical

                  8.30am with administrative duties, followed by morning staff
                  meetings or journal club sessions. I meet senior staff members
                  regularly to plan and implement assistance schemes which benefit
                  patients.</span></p>
              <p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 8px; margin-bottom: 12px;"><span style="background-color: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0);">Other
                  medical social workers also come to me to seek advice on cases they
                  are working on. I co-manage the difficult cases, such as those
                  which may involve suicide, or in which patients or family members
                  consistently display behavioural difficulties.</span></p>
              <p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 8px; margin-bottom: 12px;"><span style="background-color: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0);">I also
                  support hospital staff members who need help and teach them coping
                  strategies.</span></p>
              <p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 8px; margin-bottom: 12px;"><strong style="background-color: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0);">I have

                  that families with strong social support fare better in crises.
                  After the initial shock and confusion, members organise themselves
                  very quickly to protect the affected family member by providing
                  physiological and emotional comfort.</span></p>
              <p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 8px; margin-bottom: 12px;"><strong style="background-color: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0);">I love

                  point to turn up for their follow-up counselling sessions because
                  this shows their readiness and motivation for change.</span></p>
              <p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 8px; margin-bottom: 12px;"><span style="background-color: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0);">Patients
                  who are forthcoming, open to working with their families and
                  willing to reflect on themselves often make better
                  progress.</span></p>
              <p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 8px; margin-bottom: 12px;"><span style="background-color: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0);">They pick

                  range from relationship discord, financial issues to mental health
                  or addiction challenges.</span></p>
              <p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 8px; margin-bottom: 12px;"><strong style="background-color: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0);">Patients

                  instance, a suicidal husband may be domineering at home and may
                  keep blaming his wife and children, without realising that he has
                  failed to communicate properly with them.</span></p>

                  also explain the persistent suicidal behaviour in some patients.
                  This vicious circle may wear out their loved ones and cut patients
                  off from the support they used to have.</span></p>

              <p><br> The Institute of Mental Health (IMH) is a 2,000-bed acute tertiary
              psychiatric hospital situated on a 25-hectare campus at
              Buangkok Green Medical Park. Set amidst serene surroundings,
              IMH offers a comprehensive range of psychiatric, rehabilitative and
              counselling services for children, adolescents, adults, and the
              elderly.</p>
              <p>IMH’s tradition of care started in 1928. We were the first
              mental hospital in Singapore, starting with some 1,000 patients.
              Since then, many advances have been made in treatment, training,
              and research. Our treatment integrates evidence-based therapies,
              supported by the departments of clinical psychology, nursing,
              occupational therapy, and medical social work, to provide holistic
              care for our patients. IMH is equipped with modern facilities, with
              50 wards for inpatients and seven Specialist Outpatient
              Clinics.</p>
              <p>IMH was the first mental health institution in Asia to receive
              the Joint Commission International Accreditation in 2005, a highly
              coveted international accreditation for healthcare
              organisations. </p>
              <p>Over the years, IMH has gained a reputation for quality
              research. In 2008, the Ministry of Health,
              Singapore, entrusted IMH with a S$25 million research
              grant to implement translational and clinical research into the
              causes of schizophrenia and related psychotic disorders.</p>
              <p>IMH also plays a key role in training the next generation of
              mental health professionals in Singapore. We train psychiatrists
              and mental health professionals through the NHG-AHPL Residency
              Programme for psychiatry and through collaborations with the local
              tertiary institutions.</p>

              are subsequently conducted on a monthly basis during the PTP/BMT
              phase. Special interviews are also granted upon request. Servicemen

              <p><em><strong>Being psychologically prepared is all about knowing
              what to expect and being prepared for it.</strong></em></p>
              <p>To be better prepared, you can participate in Total Defence
              activities and Open Houses organised by the SAF/SPF/SCDF.</p>
              <p>Perhaps you should also talk to your family members and friends
              who have lived the NS experience. The more you discuss with others,
              the more comfortable and mentally prepared you’ll become.</p>
              <p><strong>Because NS life is different from civilian life before
              enlistment, there are many adjustments you need to
              make.</strong></p>
              <p>A good way to cope is to get support from your buddy and fellow
              recruits. They are going through the same tough training as you, so
              talking to one another will help relieve some tension.</p>
              <p>In most evenings during your leisure time, you’ll also have some
              time to call your family or loved ones to talk. They can give you
              emotional support during NS.</p>
              <p>You can have a one-on-one interview sessions with your officer
              to highlight any problems you may have. If you have a personal or
              family problem that need to be addressed, do let the officer
              know—he may be able to give you some advice or time off to settle
              your problems.</p>
              <p>Life in NS revolves around structure, routine and discipline.
              This helps us stay united as a uniformed organisation as well as
              imparts the rigours necessary to protect our nation and
              citizens.</p>
              <p>This does not mean there is just work and no play. In fact,
              after a few weeks in NS and you’ll find new friends and new reasons
              to smile!</p>
              <p><strong>As a soldier, one of the biggest adjustments you’ll have
              to make quickly is in regimentation and discipline.</strong></p>
              <p>Being in a uniformed organisation, you’ll have to obey orders
              from your superiors. Thus some of you may feel a sudden lack of
              freedom to do what you want and you may find yourself having
              difficulties accepting authority initially.</p>
              <p>Regimentation and discipline build strong character and
              toughness, so that you’ll be tough enough to handle difficult
              combat, crime-fighting or rescue situations without giving up or
              breaking down.</p>
              <p>When you first enlist into NS, you may have concerns of being in
              a new territory, with new faces and new things to do. But don’t let
              this get to you. Just remember the saying that “when the going gets
              tough, the tough gets going”.</p>
              <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><em>Following are some
              tips on what you can do to prepare yourself
              psychologically:</em></span></p>
              <ul>
              <li>Adopt a positive perception</li>
              <li>Build up physical stamina</li>
              <li>Develop good working attitude and habits</li>
              <li>Overcome psychological stress</li>
              <li>Adopt teamwork spirit</li>
              <li>Learn to be independent</li>
              <li>Set realistic expectations</li>
              </ul>
              <p>You can also speak to your friends or family members who have
              been through NS. Ask them to share their stories. The sharing will
              help you reduce some of your fears, uncertainties and doubts.</p>
              <p><strong>During NS you’ll be living with different
              people.</strong></p>
              <p>Because these people come from different backgrounds, they may
              not think like you do or react to situations like you would.
              Instead of trying to select your type of people, you should cherish
              the diversity. This is a chance for you to learn more about your
              fellow mates and their cultures.</p>
              <p>You’ll find that you have many opportunities to absorb the
              different cultures—during training, eating, chatting or just seeing
              and listening. Take these opportunities and learn from people
              around you, you’ll have a much better appreciation of Singapore’s
              cultural diversity.</p>

              <p>Dont lose hope yet. Many things have yet been determined, therefore, you should stay positive. If you condemn yourself, nobody will give you a chance.</p>
              <p>Every door close means the opening of another door.</p>
              <p>Brave through this period and stay strong!</p>
