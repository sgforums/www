            <div class='col-md body'>ASPS Self Defense System<br>Manufacturer Elisra Electronics Systems<br><br>Advanced Self Protection System (ASPS), a new generation of self-defense system, developed by Elisra Electronics Systems. The system includes both passive and active subsystems, and incorporates, for the first time of an F-16, both full azimuth coverage RWR and passive (EO) Missile Warning System (MWS). The system can detect pulse, CW, High PRF and Pulse Doppler signals, discriminate them from interference and prioritize the most threatening ones. The system points at a valid threat both visual and audible means. The MWS can also track a threat throughout the engagement. After detecting a missile threat, by its infrared signature, filters the background clutter by a narrow spectral window optimized to real-time signal, by an adaptive threshold. The threat assessment is determined by a after a rapid target algorithm, which tracks each threat frame-by-frame, analyzes target maneuverability, relative position, inertial data and angular velocity and intensity.<br><br>By using infrared imagery and signal processing, PAWS-2 detects and tracks incoming missile's hot plume as it appears within a protective sphere surrounding the aircraft. The system discriminates between threatening and non-threatening missiles, by evaluating the missile's trajectories. When it detects a threatening missile, PAWS-2 alerts the aircrew with a warning signal and automatically activates countermeasures such as flares and DIRCM. The ASPS' active subsystem (jammer) can be used against enemy radars and radar guided threats. The system can employ a rich repertoire of deceptive signals, at various frequencies and power levels, to employ Doppler, range, AM and various noise techniques. The system is also integrated with the Advanced Countermeasures Dispensing System (ACDS) built by BAE Systems' Israeli based subsidiary (formerly Rokar International). ACDS controls and dispenses various types of countermeasures, including chaff, flares and RF decoys produced by IMI, that adapt to the various phases of the engagement parameters. Special designs allows the ACDS to fire dual chaff cartridges double the number of on-board chaff stores per mission, and fire multi-spectral flares to response or a stronger decoy signal. The EW cockpit displays are provided by the Terma.ASPS Self Defense System<br>Manufacturer Elisra Electronics Systems<br><br><a href="http://www.defense-update.com/products/a/asps.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.defense-update.com/products/a/asps.htm</a><br><br>Theoretically speaking, this system (which is used in Israeli F-16I Sufas) can detect passive missile threats such as heatseekers.  Previously, pilots had no idea a heatseeker has acquired them until a wingman warns him, (which may be too late anyways).  I'd give this one a thumbs up as an effective well rounded EWS.</div>

A stealthy design that carries 3-4 Amraams internally.<br><br>The initial guidance and midflight updates provided by another UCAV thats dedicated as a Fire Control Radar UAV.

            <div class='col-md body'>There is talk of new UCAV  having steathy designs such as internal weapon compartment and armed with missiles and/or bombs. It is unmanned and thus small sized which is an added advantage. It can easily be operated by ground pilots. All these are good news. However, i think they have sort of missed out on equipping the UCAV with a internal gun. I mean many people have talked about the gun being obsolete in mordern air warfare since Vietnam war. They argued that there is no need for dogfights when you can blow them out of the sky with misssiles from far away. But the truth is that even till now all fighter jets are equipped with internal guns. Maybe they can take note of this in their future UCAV designs.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"></div>
