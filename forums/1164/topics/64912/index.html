It is possible to speak in such a flamboyant manner, but you need real chutzpah to pull it off successfully. I did not see this particular presentation, but I have seen BG Khoo before and he does not have the mojo. Sorry, sir, you're smart, you know it, but please don't show it.<br><br>Most SAF officers are OK, though there are always some sad exceptions. The WO and specialist corps is definitely better on the whole, though you get your share of bastards, incompetents and bad guys. On the whole, the SAF's people are about as good or bad as those in any major armed forces that I've had contact with.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I beg to differ. The SAF has not outdone itself in technology, but rather, it has underpreformed in producing personnel that can make the best out of that technology.<br><br>Technological bashing in this case here, seems to me more of a case of "bad workmen blaming their tools". Unable to grasp the future of war, many will ultimately end up blaming "weird technology" rather then making full use of it. Consider history, could you be lumped together with the jokers who said that the tank would never replace horse calvary?<br><br>Battlefield robots demostrate extreme potential, and it would be foolish to discount their development. The SAF, having realized this, is attempting to get a headstart in the region in developing this aspect of technology. Before anyone here should raise any question, one needs to realize that battlefield robots have already been in service for years and have radically altered the face of war as we know it. Consider the cruise missile, smart bomb, or just any sort of smart munition that is in essence the utilization of robotics to wage war.<br><br>While I may not like his style, it does behoove us to think seriously about the implications of technology on future warfare, rather then toss out everything unfamiliar and stick with our false security blankies of familiar "conventional" stuff, lest we fall several steps behind in the loop of arms development. Especially on the brink of a informational revolution in warfare, nations which manage to make the most of it will end up the best.<br><br>In the opening hours of warfare, sentimental attatchment to old ideas tend to be radically altered, if not torn apart. We have no crystal ball, but I dare say that somehow we have to get more intelligence then our enemy, share it faster, make sense out of it, and then act on it before they can make their next move, or even respond to ours. What does this sound like?<br><br>Network Centric Warfare.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Well, you have to realize that the most devastating styles of modern combat came essentially "out of the blue".<br><br>Blitzkrieg and massed tank formations were scoffed at until they utterly demolished the more traditional French in WWII. Everyone then started to create Panzer divisions like the Germans and beat them at their own game. The American performance in Desert Shield/Storm was also very unexpected. You may not remember anymore, but just prior to ODS the US armed forces were not held in high regard due to their loss in Vietnam and their subsequent degeneration. The idea of winning a war with waves of precision weapons delivered from the air seemed ridiculous until the 5th (?) largest army in the world folded up almost without a fight. Now everyone wants to do it.<br><br>Transformation is not a specific set of technologies. It is not unmanned platforms, cyberwarfare or stealth technology. It is simply the realization that the art of modern warfare advances in great leaps that seem ridiculous until they are shown to work. The transformed SAF might be robotic, or men on bicycles, or flocks of exploding chickens. At least we should admit we don't know and take a look.<br><br>While we simply don't have that many people experienced in "real war" due to having ever fought any wars (which is good), we have more people than you think. My PC in OCS fought Abu Sayyaf and muslim guerillas in Phillipines while he attended the military academy there. He's not the only officer I know who has seen actual combat. We have guys doing peacekeeping. The more the merrier. The main thing is to hope that they get heard, and to test as much of our doctrine and technology in combat as possible. In this respect, the SAF seems reasonably OK.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_eek.gif" alt="Shocked" title="Shocked"><br>The beef I have with the SAF system is that while we have people like your PC in OCS who have seen actual combat, they are usually NOT in the place to influence the policies made. For that matter, that particular PC you mentioned was in OCS!! Shouldn't he be in some place where his experience could be tapped on. I am not saying that this is purely a SAF problem. One can see that happening in the best of armies, e.g. US where you can always surf and find sites run by serious army types with tons of experience and wealth of advice but are not in the position to push it forward.<br><br>Our SAF meritocratic system has always depended on office bound scholar generals and colonels to lead the way. While that has been good in general, the fact of the matter is that they are often then not stuck in ivory towers. From my personal experience, the analogy best applied is those who are in the actual ground experience e.g. sales or marketing and those academics who sit in their cubicles reading theoretical business principle. While each have their own perspectives and worthy input, an effective organization needs to have both inputs with wise decision makers who can apply it. SAF needs to have that balance too. Scholarly generals need to be bloodied too. See how men like Westmore and the guy in "we were soliders too" contributed to the general growth of the US army.<br><br>my 2 cents.</div>

Probability and statistics.<br><br>However, my main problem is that the great scholars have these one way track planned for them. Even during NS we all know that when a scholar CO comes in, he will only spend XXmths with this battalion and then move on. My own AVP in a GLC who was a LTC when he ROD told me the same thing when he got his scholarship to go to Oxford.<br><br>I understand that these "plans" are SOP for the MINDEF top brass to move their "investments" quickly thru the system so as to reap their ROIs. But becos of this factory style method, I believe many of these scholars who reach BG or COL at very "tender" age, do not have the full capacity to empathise what the lower ranks feel or think. What more being able to absorb their inputs...<br><br>The old guards of Singapore (both Political and Military) had to go thru "shit" to reach their position. But in our haste to replicate a great model, they have lost out in giving that same shit experience that made them great to the younger generation.<br><br>For my part, when I started work, altho I had the piece of paper to prove my "worth", my boss wisely put me in my place and made me start off with a nominal entry position (altho I did things beyond that job description). People around me told me to complain but on hindsight that made me a better worker as it made me learn how to "earn" my place in the organization.<br><br>Back to the generals...from what I can see, there is this lack of emphatic depth in them that allows them to "learn" and the humility to absorb what lao jiaos and experienced people can provide in terms of their input. technological buzz and digital toys are something they can get into faster and better than good old information of how to fight a war (the dirty and bloody way).<br><br>So in short, I am not saying that we need to just bloody our scholars but that somehow a way must be created to put more humility and willingness to learn into them, the mojo that set apart our founding fathers from the rest of the people in their generation.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>The OCS PC that fought guerillas in Phillipines was a scholar  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"> That's why he was attending the military academy (university) there. He had a thousand different tips on what worked and didn't work in combat. Nearly got shot several times, at least one kill (cut off the guy's ears as a trophy). SAF infantry tactics worked great against Abu Sayyaf, apparently. He's probably a "crab" now, and might make stars if he's lucky. Other scholars have attended Sandhurst military academy, patrolled Belfast and fought IRA terrorists, though I've not met these people personally.<br><br>Note that SAF scholarships require the scholar to be attached to foreign military units during their education, so my PC was not unique. Scholars are the most likely people to have seen combat in the SAF, so don't look down on them too much. Of course, having survived a few firefights and gotten a few kills doesn't necessarily make you a good leader. Many scholars are still crap. But saying that people with combat experience should lead is basically saying that the situation we have now is perfect.<br><br>I think the problem is more basic. The personnel advancement system in the SAF needs a revamp. Unit leadership performance should count more toward an officer's promotion than performance in staff or training billets. Or even better, officers who do well in unit leadership positions should get them more often, but not be crippled in pay compared to his staff colleagues. And officers who do well in staff or training positions should get them more often. That would make so much more sense. No more desk jockeys getting laughed at by the men, or fire-breathing combat machines wasted in the office.</div>

Which in lay terms means full-scale battle between two well-equipped armies.<br><br>The US army's first computerized force however missed major combat operations in Iraq in March because Turkey did not let it deploy from its territory into northern Iraq.<br><br>The 4ID instead came in through Kuwait and moved north to take up its current position patrolling the so-called Sunni triangle north of Baghdad.<br><br>But soldiers in Tikrit say the digits are proving useful in combating the low-level insurgency that supporters of the former regime are conducting against coalition forces.<br><br>Sergeant Major Salvador Martinez of the 4ID's 1-22 Battalion is another believer. The system saves lives and cuts down on friendly fire incidents, and because it's Windows-based it's as easy to use as a home computer, he said.<br><br>"Those are targets that we hit last night," he said, tapping with a stylus on a "ruggedised" computer screen mounted over the passenger seat on his jeep. On the screen several buildings are highlighted on a map of Tikrit.<br><br>If the "digital division" is deemed a success, of which most soldiers here are confident, the next step is likely to be an integrated digitalised army, navy and air force.<br><br>Even foot soldiers could be equipped with mini screens showing the same information seen by commanders and crews in vehicles. </blockquote>News from the first Digital Div on the field, hope that SAF could get some tips from them.<br><br><span class="large"><strong><span style="color: darkred;">CHARGE!!!</span></strong></span><br><img src="http://www.amatorce.de/Mehmet.gif"><br></div>
