These are specially trained assault troops organised into assault companies who are meant to exploit gaps in the enemy lines and infiltrate as far as possible into the rear of the enemies. It was the first employment of infiltration in infantry tactics.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"> In terms of fighting qualities, personally I think the best German formations inspite of the atrocities commited by them would be the classical Waffen SS divisions IE Hitlerjugend, Das Reich, Totemkopf and Leibstandarte Adolf Hitler</div>
