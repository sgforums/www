I know both were undergoing tests and logically there should be one winner.<br>And what about the CV90-120?<br><br>Off Topic - Harimau - do you post in other forums as well?

            <div class='col-md body'>Employing MBTs in the jungle has never been the main problem at all.  M-60s were once deployed in vietnam, with its predecessor.   The main problem has always been that the capability of a main battle tank would be limited in dense vegetation n trees.  Often also restricted to certain jungle roads etc.<br><br>Another thing, there aren't really HUGE rivers in Peninsular Malaysia.  Nothing a combat engineer detachment can't solve.  Moreover, many modern tanks are able to ford rivers with some preparation.<br><br>In relation to Singapore's Armored capabilities.  We should continue to acquire main battle tanks, n upgrade current ones.  With exception of some really soft terrain... places where light tanks can't cross, main battle tanks can't either.  And believe me, if opposition combat engineers decide to create a lot of "counter-mobility" obstacles, ALL our armored vehicles will be affected.  Be they minefields, flooded areas, anti tank ditches or watever.  Light Tank or main battle will both be affected.  So might as well get a balanced force of both heavy armor and speed.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Guys,<br>No doubt MAF combat engineers capabilities still a bit 'outdated' yet measures has been taken since 2000 to restructure certain elements.Hence the purchased of two types of tactical bridges (i think 6 in total)- Vickers PLC MLC 90 tactical bridge which could withstand a max load of 70 tonnes and CNIM France pontoon bridges but with lesser max load circa 50 odd tonnes.Even the 1st MBT regiments are made of 48 MBT and 14 support vehicles (which include at least 6 AVLB).T 84M should come with the BREM 84 and similar  AVLB like the ones mounted on the PT91M.Nos still uncertain though.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I've got the feeling Mindef already suspected/knew MBTs would proliferate in the SEA region and thus decided to take 1 step ahead by acquiring the most advanced anti-tank helos in the form of the Longbow Apaches.<br><br>However, I would also hope that SAF does not relinquish our current MBT capability after the Centurions are redrawn from services (I cannot confirm this but it was discussed in other threads).  I hope to see some new 120mm gun armed MBTs with the latest fire-control system and defensive aid suite,  albeit in a small number of 60 or so vehicles.<br><br>Finally, I can nevery quite understand why the TOW-armed Fennecs were redrawn/stored. I thought the more anti-tank choppers we have the better we are to deal with the MBTs and numerous enemies AFV/IFVs.</div>

I think its time we start opening up the scope of this forum to more than just Singapore and Malaysia. . . after all, the forum name is 'Military Nuts', not 'Singapore Military Nuts' or Malaysia Military Nuts'. . .although focus will still be Sg due to it being hosted at Sgforums.com and cos most of us are singaporeans. . .</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>After reading more about the T-84 MBT spec from <a href="http://www.morozov.com.ua/eng/body/t84.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.morozov.com.ua/eng/body/t84.html</a> I have to say that I am quite impressed - at least on the advertised broucher figures and technical description of the vehicle.<br><br>On paper, it is more or less equipped sufficiently sophisticated to meet all sort of threats in modern battlefields. Theoretically, they could match some of the current generation of western tanks. However, I will always take a pinch of salt from a former Warsaw pact country's product. Although, on paper, the T-84 seems to have it all, a good large calibre gun, good reactive armour, stabalised gun and sights, advanced thermal sights, advanced fire-control system, defensive-aid suite, high power engine, etc, the quality of the tank under battle condition is still unknown. Given that the Russian designed (originated) tanks constantly fair well below western/Israeli design tanks, I would put a big question mark on the sale pitch.<br><br>But it is easy to see why MAF is being lure into buying such a tank - not to mention, a very similar design from Poland. If one doesn't have sufficient cash to purchase a good western tank, it is not possible to hold against the temptation of purchasing a Eastern European tanks given the impressive array of gadgets at a very affordable price.<br><br>Having said this, I think SAF should also not be found unprepared. I am more and more incline to believe that it is imperative for SAF to maintain modern MBT capability. Perhaps SAF should consider the possibility of getting some Lelarc????? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>
