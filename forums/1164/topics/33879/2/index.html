I believe the AVLBs is definitely a must unless the MBTs are going to operate on highways ONLY... If the MBTs ever trying fording in the kind of swampy and muddy rivers that are commonly found in this region, then MAF might have to consider using an accelerated depreciation rate to account for wear and tear.<br><br><span style="color: black;">Also to clarify </span><strong>Shotgun</strong>'s comment that "<span style="color: darkred;"><strong>Employing MBTs in the jungle has never been the main problem at all. M-60s were once deployed in vietnam, with its predecessor. The main problem has always been that the capability of a main battle tank would be limited in dense vegetation n trees. Often also restricted to certain jungle roads etc.</strong></span>"<br><br>In vietnam, US Army have mostly employed the MBTs (M60) as firebase ie. in static defence or fire support. due to the limitations imposed by the natural obstacles. Even when they are employed in mobile operations, they are to provide cover fires for the Armored Cavalry (M113 APCs) in small numbers. Never have the tanks operated in a unit larger than a platoon ( I believe that is 4 MBTs each platoon).<br><br>There is not enough room for the MBTs to manoveur around and put their capabilities to the best use like what you have rightly pointed out "restricted to certain jungle roads".<br><br>If the MAF is going to employing the MBTs as a fire support weapon, then it is really not justifying the purchase. It is cheaper to buy perhaps 4-5 units of portable 120mm mortal and mount them on some mobile plaform either towed or mounted on APCs for the cost of a MBT.<br><br>Dear HARIMAU, I hope your minister and generals have make a detailed cost and benefit analysis before deciding on the acquisition of the MBTs. They better not decide to buy the tanks because just to boast the image of the MAF. These "creatures" are paid for by the hard working citizens of Malaysia!!!!<br><br>Lastly, any idea what kind of armour vehicle is it on the right the T-84 picture you posted earlier ? Looks like a Armoured Recovery Vehicle ..... also look like the American M9 Armored Combat Earthmover.</span></div>

ST should also look at BAe Merlin 81mm millimeter wave mortar rounds as well as Bofor BONUS 155mm rounds. Secondly, US might not be too keen to allow Singapore to integrate Longbow radar with an indigenous weapon/munition. They will have to reveal the millimeter wave frequencies and perhaps any frequency-encoding algorithm to Singapore for such a scenario.</div>

The current SPIKE series AT missile (co developed by ST) is more than capable to handle the current MBT threats. Come mon pal, we do not have so much "money" to slash on assorted toys like our good neighbours, so have to select the best and most cost effective one available in the market <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by SingaporeTyrannosaur:</div><div class="quote_body">Nah, ST should develop something like the copperhead... but I doubt so, because we'll never face MBTs in threatening enough numbers for some time to justify overloading on anti tank munitions. We seem pretty content with Longbows for standoff anti armour support and ATGMs for direct antitank fire...</div></blockquote></div>
