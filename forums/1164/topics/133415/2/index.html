He was an ammo tech i think. </div></blockquote>Sorry..me no ammo junkie..me armt junkie.<img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>Anyway, before we can even convince the US Army to adopt the SAR21, even in field trials, ST must really convince our local operators that they can solve three main issues.<br><br>First issue, the scope fogging problem.This is very intriguing because scopes have fogged up, been replaced with new ones, and yet the same problem occurs time and time again, often within months.An Infantryman cannot be told his weapon cannot even take moisture or water occasionally, and the downtime caused by this problem is pretty bad.<br><br>Second issue, the LAD.Granted, it is integrated and poses less chance of this item falling off due to vibration from intense firing, however, in-field replacement is a pain and nightmare.You cannot do such a replacement in battle, and to take this weapon and send it back to rear lines is something that cannot be allowed in battle.<br><br>If you have detachable ACOG or Trijcon sights or floating red-dot reflex(which incidentally is better than a visible laser) on your MIL 1913 rail, repair or maintenance issue will be much easier and roving maintenance teams can  reach the frontlines and find that they do make a difference.<br><br>Third issue is the magazine release catch.This is a niggling design flaw that operators have often feedback to DSTA that it poses a barrier to combat reloading.And seconds are lost when you have to transfer one hand to steady the gun while the other depresses the button to release the magazine and viceversa to load a fresh magazine.<br><br>These issues aside, the great thing going for the SAR21 is the center of gravity.I do not know if these flaws will be addressed for the next batch of rifles.However, I had the chance to handle the SAR21 MMS Rail version at Asian Aerospace last year and this enhanced model, though vastly heavier, seems like a better compromise.<br><br><img src="http://i3.photobucket.com/albums/y89/LazerLordz/SAR21MMS.jpg"><br><br>I do know that STK has offered a version of the SAR21 with no LAD,but with a front grip.This version was used by the SAF peacekeepers in Timor Leste.Another export version has the MIL 1913 rail on the upper handguard.Perhaps these might stand a chance in the US market, however I thnk  they would have solved the three issues before they decide to enter into the fray.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I've handled a Steyr bullpup before and changing mags is a pain - as with all bullpups.<br><br>I don't like optics for though it allows even bobo kings to shoot with relative accuracy, it does slow down target acquisition and limits your awareness of the surroundings as you aim down the tunnel.<br><br>And as I suspected already, the scope has fogging problems. People who wear glasses or have simply used a pair of binoculars will know that optics are not the best thing to have in a humid environment like ours.<br><br>Therefore, the SAR-21 must also have a very good pair of open metal sights.<br><br>The SAR-21 is too heavy. The LAD is more likely to give your position away and give your enemy something to aim at.<br><br>Finally, the SAR-21 has no lug for bayonet attachment.<br><br>While the press tells us that the SAR-21 had received good comments from abroad, I think most people will wait for the Mk 2.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Well...as with all laser sights,they are sighted in for specific ranges.A LAD on any weapon zeroed for a range of 100m will hit at exactly the point of aim at 100m,but if you wanna hit further,you gotta aim off (ie.aim higher)or if you wanna hit lower you gotta aim lower to acheive the hit.<br><br>Besides...the really really big turn offs about the SAR21 is that the magazine release and changing of a new magazine is really really clumsy and also,the positioning of the selector switch is really stupid.At the butt of the weapon...my goodness!!! perhaps should incorporate a H&amp;K style of selector would be better.As for the lag of a bayonet lug,I belief we can make do w/o it,but then again..it would be a good to have.So yah,having a bayonet lug is quite essential too..<br><br>Yup,read in the magazine Guns &amp; Ammo for Law Enforcement that the LAPD if not wrong and Maimi-Dade Swat were carrying out trials with the SAR21 and found it to be very useful to their work.So now...its up to them to decide to include it in their arsernal anot..</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>i dun think the US would ever buy the SAR-21 for military use. Firstly the defense spending is reviewed by the Senate( or the suits in congress) and of course weapon manufacturers have their backers in some senator they would definitely veto the idea(politics). the only way SAR-21 is used in US if its for law enforcement or Special Operations who have their on which weapon they want to use. of course there is will be also trouble if the US military uses SG rifles and got involved in a situation in combat (like the the movie Rules of Engagement). Surely SG dun want to be associated with such situations. lastly i think ST doesnot have the reputation of Colt, Heckler &amp; Kochor Fn Herstal to win the bid to provide the weapons no matter how gd it is</div>

One of the first things that I noticed is the good view of the semi-clear ammunition clip. This one is empty (you can clearly see the spring inside), but you get a good idea of how easy it will be for our guys to check how many rounds they've got left with a quick glance.<br><br>Somewhere I read a remark that an electronic indicator in the sight would allow soldiers to monitor their ammo without taking their eyes off their target, and that's certainly true. In any event, the clear clip is an improvement over the current ones, as long as it's durable enough.</blockquote></div>
