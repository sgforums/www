            <div class='col-md body'>Yes! Assualt weapon ban is lifted last year !and now we can have anything we want in most of the states! not in places like New York City , People's republic of California and Massachusatts! and some other communist US states ! har har! <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br>The ban is a joke from the beginning, anything that has a pistol grip, flahhider, bayonet lug, box magazine and semi auto firing .... consitute to a assualt rifle!  Anwyay! as you know all these laws are written by morons! We get to keep all the military style weapons as long as they are made in the USA! so! to consitute a US made guns, there need to have a parts count ! thus we are seeing a lot of AK, FAL, etc basically are Polish or Bulgarian AK but have a few little parts that have enough parts count to make it USA made! Thus ! US made AK74 ! Hoooo Hoooo!the sunset also setset on the magazine ban ! NOw all the pistol we can have the normal capacity , We use to were ban to 10 rd mags! now we can have the regular caps!<br><br>We are back to the good old days ! AK47 for $250! AR15 can be had for $500!<br><br>Fortunately we are seeing more company like FN building the FN2000 and P90 in the uS to make the rifle available to civilian here.  Hope to see some SIG-551 an 550 , maybe good to have the FN-SCAR.<br><br>more toys here  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br><a href="http://i3.photobucket.com/albums/y66/davechng/Guns/aef87812.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://i3.photobucket.com/albums/y66/davechng/Guns/aef87812.jpg</a><br><a href="http://i3.photobucket.com/albums/y66/davechng/Guns/guns.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://i3.photobucket.com/albums/y66/davechng/Guns/guns.jpg</a><br><br>Maybe some Russian Sniper!<br><br><a href="http://i3.photobucket.com/albums/y66/davechng/Guns/SVD-TIGER2.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://i3.photobucket.com/albums/y66/davechng/Guns/SVD-TIGER2.jpg</a><br><br>Have more to come!!&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br><br>I met a few SIngaporean here that shoots also!  Its amazing what we can learn from really owning the rifle and shoot competetively. If I have known what I know now, our CSM in the ARMY in small arms training seems like amatuer!<br><br>ON the discussion of the M4 and SAR21, US Army will not go into the bullpupu design becasue of several reason ! One of my buddies here just came back from Iraq for 2 tours ! they were evaluating the bullpup and find it awkward in certain style of fighting... reloading and magazine change is awkward and cumbersome ! ( I can attest to that when I was doing a 3 rifle match using my Steyr AUG.. big mistake!) the big thing now is the ammunition, the 5.56 M855 do nothave the knock down power unless you have a 20" barrel like the full size M16,! M4 is punching hole thru talibans and iraqis and not taking them down! so far the 6.5 grendal and 6.8SPC seems to do well! but in full auto it is not as controllable ! I guess it is all in the training. ! Also! the US Army M4 is in Full auto and not 3 rd burst!  the 3rd burst pack on the M16A2 is a joke ! it puts u triggering spring in 3 setting thus 3 differnt trigger pull! and if you shoot 1 rd the next burst is 2 rd! I guess thats why they are getting rid of it... I presume the USMC is still keeping the POS burst kit on their M16A3.  I heard  from Sources in the ARMY that the XM8 from HK did not do well in the test and they are openning up the evaluation for more contender!  !Hope to other designs!&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Actually I am waiting to see the HK M4 ... it is an M16 upper but have a piston on it.. to me that is the ultimate AR which solves the 1st problem of the M16 direct gas system ... and the ergonomics of the M16 series is just 2nd to none...<br><br>DaveC!</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>HAve contacted them when I was in SHotshow, .... they are only interested to market it to the military and law enforcement department,<br><br>UNfortunately, these people do not realize the concept of US mind set, a lot of law enforcement dept are quite entrench with the M16,AR system becasue of the ease of transition ... most officers are Ex-military and transisting to a M16 system is the logical way! to retrain everyone to a new Bullpup system requires a lot more training.  Don;t forget the lawyers in the US that hound on anyone because of lack of training ! so! it is also a liability isuue to involve a brand new type of system.<br><br>Thus, the system don;t sell here,!<br><br>As for class 3!  as long as the weapon is built after 1986 and imported, it cannot be sold as a c3 weapon unless you are a C2 dealer or law enforcement or military!<br><br>ST do not realize the power of the US civilian arms ownership! HK and several other weapons mfr have catered their weapon systems to the US public and gain quite a lot of mkt place ! and if your product is familiar by the general user,  than the product sells itself if it is a good product. TOo bad these people have such narrow minds!<br><br>Same thing with the Ultimax 100!  the main complain with my SEAL friends are that they feeding system is not good ! the drum has to be loaded with machine and the system do not allow a belt feedinf system ! also the ROF is much slower compared to the M249 which in the US concept, they need a high rate of fire, belt fed as the bare minimum for a SAW!<br><br>Thus ! none of the SAR21 or U100 is selling here in the US or western based countries. at the rate ST is marketing... Maybe some 3rd world country may look into it ! SO SAD!<br><br>YOu will be suprise how much civilian market has influence the military and law enforecement here in the US! we have IPSC, IDPA , NRA and other matches that civilians and law enforement join ! and a lot of grand master shooter are inturn training the military on shooting techniques!

If someone shoot his M16 empty, he can still reload and fire within 2 seconds. With a bullpup it would take a lifetime of awkward fumbling. I have handled a Steyr but never fired one.<br><br>For infantry use I'm not too keen on optics on account of all the mud, dust, water and general dampness that you encounter in the field.<br><br>Maybe optics are useful in the desert where it is mostly dry and you shoot over long distances.<br><br>Even in FIBUA I can imagine its usefulness when you are shooting at someone bunkered in a building - but optics will be crap for CQB fighting indoors.<br><br>But I think that's where the red dot thing come in. I think the red dot laser is very useful for CQB where you may need to shoot from the hip at an instant, but for night fighting in the jungle what's the point of being able to see your red dot if you can't see anything else? And it also gives enemy RPG teams something to aim at.<br><br>Some of the photos from SHOT shows on the net showed that more than one company is making  gas pistons for the M16. I think some of these are sold as conversion kits to be fitted by a gunsmith. It involve a completely redesigned bolt carrier without the little pipe thing. However, the piston system cutaway pic I saw showed a lot fiddly little parts. Wouldn't those similarly get clogged with gas carbon?</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Guys, I recently tried the SAR21 again. I realised something, there is something with te trigger which irks me. Okay, previously with the M16, I can shoot double taps with the weapon in the SEMI mode swiftly,however with the SAR21, I realise that I'm unable to shoot doubletaps. I have to like release the trigger and then pull back again. This is kinda slow, I can't feel the weapon and tell exactly when it how much trigger pull is required to fully fire off the weapon. Its kinda strange as the trigger pull seems to require more strength compared to the M16. Perhaps the sharpshooter version has a lighter trigger squeeze?</div>
