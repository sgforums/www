The family consists of a Carbine, Special<br><br>ompact (SC), Designated  Marksman (DM), and Light Machine Gun (LMG) weapon systems.  This endeavor will  be conducted in three phases consisting of a System Design and Development<br><br>(SDD) Phase, a Low Rate Initial Production (LRIP) Phase and a Full Rate Production (FRP) Phase.<br><br>The Carbine, SC and DM weapon systems shall share at least 80% parts<br><br>commonality and shall share at least 50% commonality with the LMG.  Each weapon<br><br>system shall be equipped with a Multi Purpose Sighting System (MPSS) enabling<br><br>the warfighter to rapidly and effectively engage stationary and moving targets<br><br>both with reflexive fire at close ranges, and with precision fire out to the<br><br>maximum effective range of the variant (Carbine-500m, SC-150m, DM-600m, LMG-<br><br>600m).  All OICW Increment I weapon systems shall incorporate a resident<br><br>limited visibility fire control with infrared aim light, illuminator and<br><br>visible red laser pointer.  The infrared aiming light and illuminator shall be greater than, or equal to the capability of the AN/PEQ-2A.<br><br>A properly zeroed OICW Increment I Carbine (zeroed to 300 meters), SC (zeroed<br><br>to 150 meters), DM (zeroed to 300 and 500 meters), or LMG (zeroed to 300<br><br>meters) shall enable a warfighter firing from varying fighting positions, both<br><br>supported and unsupported to engage E-type silhouettes under conditions that<br><br>include target exposure times from 3 to 8 seconds and targets moving 2 to 4<br><br>meters per second to the following metrics: Carbine (moving targets to 300m)<br><br>with a Probability of Hit greater than .60 at 150m; SC (moving and stationary<br><br>targets) with a Probability of Hit greater than .40 at 100m; DM (stationary<br><br>targets, zeroed to 500m) with a Probability of Hit greater than .50 at 500m;<br><br>LMG (Hit on first 6-round burst against a single E-type silhouette in an 8<br><br>target array, zeroed to 300m) with a Probability of Hit greater than .04 at<br><br>600m.<br>The OICW Increment I Carbine, SC and DM shall demonstrate 18,000 Mean Rounds<br><br>Between Essential Function Failure (MRBEFF) for Class III malfunctions (i.e.,<br><br>for non-operator correctable malfunctions which cause the loss of essential OICW Increment I functionality) and 2,300 MRBEFF for Class I and II malfunctions combined (Class I malfunctions are operator clearable within 10<br><br>seconds, whereas Class II malfunctions require more than 10 seconds but less than 10 minutes to clear but can be corrected by the operator with available equipment).  The OICW Increment I LMG shall demonstrate 18,000 MRBEFF for Class<br><br>III malfunctions and 1,900 MRBEFF for Class I and II malfunctions combined<br><br>The OICW Increment I Carbine, SC, DM weapon systems shall have a sustained rate<br><br>of fire greater than or equal to 45 rounds per minute without degrading<br><br>reliability.  The OICW Increment I LMG weapon system�s sustained rate of fire<br><br>shall be at a minimum of 72 rounds per minute for ten minutes without degrading  reliability and accuracy.<br><br>All OICW Increment I weapon systems shall have a minimum barrel life of 15,000 rounds.<br><br>All Proposals will include written submissions and test (bid) samples, both of<br><br>will be 60 days after Solicitation release.  A pre-solicitation or a pre-<br><br>proposal conference will be conducted at a later date (to be determined).<br><br>The offeror shall submit four (4) of each variant for a total of sixteen (16) complete weapon systems, along with sufficient spare parts, to the Government<br><br>for bid sample testing no later than the closing date of the solicitation.<br><br>Should an offeror�s bid samples pass through the initial and subsequent go/no  go screening criteria, the samples will be evaluated with live fire to<br><br>demonstrate the weapon systems� ability to meet the system requirements.<br><br>The winning offeror will be awarded a contract for test quantities to proceed to a Milestone C decision, if required.  After satisfying the requirements for a Milestone C decision, Low Rate Initial Production (LRIP) quantities (up to 4,900 weapon systems) shall be produced.   Subsequent to the production of LRIP quantities, the Government may award multiple Full Rate Production (FRP) options to the winning offeror (up to 134,500 total weapon systems if the total number of options are exercised).<br><br>The OICW Increment I family of weapons is intended to replace current weapon systems to include the M4, M16, M249 and selected M9 pistols for the active army.<br><br>A Request for Proposal (RFP) to be posted on the TACOM-ARDEC Acquisition Center website located at: http://procnet.pica.army.mil  is planned for release on or about 23 March 2005.  Proposals, along with sixteen (16) bid samples, are required to be delivered within sixty (60) days from the date the RFP is released.

            <div class='col-md body'>Yes, this can be seen in the past acquisition on the Stryker instead of our special Bionix version. Although,it is debatable that our Bionix is superior to the Stryker due to lack of actual combat experience but there are some clear advantages such as being more capable in handling the additional weight of extra armour. The US will most likely choose a local design to create jobs in their own country even if the design is less capable. This is one of the bad points of real democracies. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>The last I heard about the xm-8 is that it did not fair well during its test run in the fields.  Also, the U.S Army has put a hold on their replacement of rifle due to new requirements.  They might start a new round of selection of rifle again but thats unconfirm yet.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br><br>Yup, its true that some SWAT teams are trying out the SAR-21 &amp; though there are some problems as you guys have pointed out, overall review was that most of the SWAT officers prefer the SAR-21 to the M-4 when carrying out CQC.  They like the fact that its also using 5.56 ammo, the weapon being compact, etc.  As for whether it'll become part of the SWAT teams armoury that depends on the individual county SWAT teams' fundings, etc.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"></div>
