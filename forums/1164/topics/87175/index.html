            <div class='col-md body'>By Chief Journalist Melinda Larson, CARAT Task Group Public Affairs<br>Released: July 16, 2004<br><br>KUANTAN, Malaysia -- High in the Malaysian skies, U.S. Navy and Royal Malaysian Air Force (RMAF) fighter pilots went nose-to-nose during a 10-day series of air-to-air combat scenarios that ended July 15.<br><br>Â“Every pilot benefited from seeing how a dissimilar aircraft performs. ThereÂ’s only so much you can learn from a book. You have to see how the other aircraft perform,Â” said Lt. Chris Hubbard who flies the F/A-18F Super Hornet for Strike Fighter Squadron (VFA) 102.<br><br>The Navy pilots from VFA 102, 192 and 195 flew F/A-18Cs and F/A-18F Super Hornets against the RMAFÂ’s MiG-29s and Hawks. The air-to-air combat training, along with a fighter symposium, was part of the Malaysia phase of the Cooperation Afloat Readiness and Training (CARAT) exercise. CARAT is a series of bilateral exercises with several Southeast Asia nations designed to enhance the interoperability of the respective sea services, and as was the case in Malaysia, other services as well.<br><br>Â“It was a great opportunity for us to fight against the type of threat we may face from other countries,Â” said Lt. Jason Naidyhorski, an F/A-18C pilot with VFA 195. Â“ItÂ’s a good feeling to learn how to fight against a potential threat and be more prepared.Â”<br><br>While the pilots received briefs on the performance and capabilities of each otherÂ’s aircraft, in the air the pilots were able to see for themselves what to expect from a possible enemy aircraft.<br><br>In addition to learning about each otherÂ’s aircraft, the pilots learned from each other.<br><br>Â“We see this as a chance to interact with a force that has gone through real-time combat,Â” noted RMAG MiG-29 pilot Maj. Sebastian Williams. Â“We can gain a lot of knowledge and experience working with the U.S. Navy pilots.  We shared openly about our aircraft and our experiences.Â”<br><br>In the end, how did the aircraft stack up against each other?<br><br>Â“It was a good fight. We had to struggle to compete,Â” said MiG-29 pilot Cpt. Roshaidi Bin Â“G-MonÂ” Kamaruddin who earned his call sign by pushing the limit on his Â“nine-GÂ” capable aircraft.  Each aircraft has a Â“GÂ” or gravitational pull limit. One Â“GÂ” is equal to gravity at sea level.<br><br>The RMAF pilots were impressed by the capabilities of the Super Hornet. Â“It almost matches or surpasses what a MiG is designed to do,Â” Williams said. Â“I know we've not seen all that it can do. I hope they can come back again.Â”<br><br>When they werenÂ’t Â“fighting,Â” friendships between the pilots and crews developed during the 10-day training series that began with the squadronsÂ’ arrival on July 6 prior to the official start of CARAT Malaysia on July 12.<br><br>Â“The Malaysians were great hosts. We had fun. They were very kind,Â” said Hubbard.<br><br>It seems the Malaysian pilots felt similarly about their U.S. counterparts.<br><br>Â“The U.S. pilots are cool,Â” said Kamaruddin.<br><br>In all, nearly 120 U.S. Navy pilots and crew took part in CARAT Malaysia. VFA 102, 192 and 195 are forward deployed to Atsugi, Japan.<br><br></div>
