Therefore vehicles not fitted with Blue Force Tracker will not be at Â“grave risk of being destroyed by other fighting vehicles or coalition aircraftÂ” as suggested by your article.<br><br>The Battle Management System requires either satellite, combined with a data fusion centre, or radio based (terrestrial) carrier signals to enable a network to be established.<br><br>Defence is negotiating the provision of satellite services which is expected to be established by the end of 2007. In the meantime an interim solution is being investigated.<br><br>It is disappointing that reporting on such important matters glosses over the actual facts and details.<br><br>Brigadier Mike Phelps<br>Department of Defence<br><br></blockquote><img src="http://www.defence.gov.au/includes/coa.gif"><br></div>

Frankly, when they say Eyeball a target, i always thought it's eyeballing them from a camera in a targetting pod.<br><br>Having a target coordinator on the ground would be the best way to avoid friendly bombings.
