            <div class='col-md body'>(Source: Rada Electronic Industries Ltd.; issued March 3, 2005)<br><br>NETANYA, Israel --- RADA Electronic Industries Ltd. today announced that it has successfully completed the prototype of the avionic upgrade project for the A-4 Skyhawk for the Israeli Air Force. Today, during the afternoon, the ceremony presenting the prototype for the first time, will take place in the Israeli Air Force base in Hazerim.<br><br>RADA won its first A-4 Skyhawk contract with the Israeli Air Force in January 2003, for the supply of the ACE-II system for advanced debriefing. The system operates in conjunction with a ground system that shows the pilot his flight performance in video and three-dimensional graphics. At the beginning of 2004, the project, led by RADA, turned into a full avionics system upgrade.<br><br>The upgrade program includes design and installation of a Ring Laser Gyro (RLG) and Global Positioning System (GPS) based navigation system, Head-Up Display (HUD) units, weapons management and control systems, and an advanced display and control system for the pilot. In the project, all Skyhawk jets used by the Israeli air force will be upgraded, half are single-seater models and the remainder are twin-seater models.<br><br>The Israeli Air Force recognizes the importance of advanced debriefing system, which enables better and more efficient training program for pilots, and always ensures that it uses the best debriefing systems available. Today, a significant portion of fighter jets used by the Israeli Air Force are equipped with debriefing systems made by RADA. The new F-16I squadrons of the Israeli Air Force are also equipped with the "Reality" system, one of the most advanced debriefing systems made by RADA.<br><br>Adar Azancot, RADA's Chief Executive Officer commented: "The selection of RADA, for performing an upgrade project, by the Israeli Air Force is proof of its trust in RADA - both its people and its products. We are proud to be partners in such a special event for the defense industry, in which the first upgraded prototype jet will be presented and will be known from now on as "The Improved Skyhawk". The performance of the jet, as test-flights have proved so far, will guarantee that also in the future, the Air Force Flight Academy will have the best and most advanced jets for training the Israeli pilots of tomorrow."<br><br>In the upgrade program, RADA co-operated with the LAHAV division of Israel Aircraft Industries. IAI will also be maintaining these jets during their use by the Israeli Air Force. In addition, other Israeli companies including Nir Or and Vectop have been working with RADA, as subcontractors, on the program. Vectop, whose assets were recently acquired by RADA, is engaged in the design, development and marketing of electro-optic and debriefing equipment. It was the supplier of the camera for the Head-Up Display units.<br><br>RADA Electronic Industries Ltd. is an Israel based company involved in the military and commercial aerospace industries, with 110 staff. The company specializes in Avionics, Ground Debriefing Stations (Video, ACMI and Maintenance) and Electro optic cameras for a/c and armored vehicles.<br><br>I guess this means skyhawks still got use and we don't need to scrap them  anymore after NGF.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I think it's way too early to write off the A4S.....actually the Israelis "Improved Skyhawk" is not far better than the current RSAF A4S.<br><br>Actually, I think the avionics in the A4S is still better off. The ACE black box is actually the ACMI pod......of course I'm not sure if they have moved it into the airframe? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br><br>Those closer to the aircraft will know more.......<br><br>CAS role maybe relegated to the Apache.....but A4S can is still relevant - freeing up the Vipers for more figther bomber strike missions.<br><br>Maybe we should keep a few in flying state and the rest near flying state like the USAF's Air National Guard unit.<br><br></div>
