            <div class='col-md body'>FUCHS 2 ARMOURED WHEELED VEHICLE, GERMANY<br><br>The Fuchs 2 armoured personnel carrier is a new version of the 6 x 6 Fuchs (Fox) Transportpanzer 1. The vehicles are built by Rheinmetall Landsysteme, based in Kiel and Kassel in Germany. Rheinmetall has delivered 1,236 Fuchs 1 vehicles in a variety of mission variants. The vehicles are in service with the German Army and the armed forces of Saudi Arabia, The Netherlands, United Kingdom, USA and Venezuela. The Fuchs has been in operational service with German KFOR troops in Kosovo and Macedonia. Trials of the Fuchs 2 began in 2001.<br><br>In February 2005, the United Arab Emirates placed an order for Fuchs NBC (Nuclear, Biological and Chemical) reconnaissance vehicles which will be based on the Fuchs II.<br><br>The Fuchs 2 has a maximum combat weight of 20,000kg and is fully amphibious. The main improved features incorporated into the Fuchs 2 are the integration of a more powerful, low emission engine allowing a payload increase of 4t to a total of 9.4t, depending on the version. The drive and brakes have been upgraded to match the higher power and weight performance. The height of the rear crew compartment has been increased by 145mm and roof-mounted air louvres have been installed. Other improvements include the digital onboard system to CAN-Standard SAE J 1939 and a central tyre inflation system.<br><br>The cabin is sufficiently large with 10.5mÂ³ stowage capacity to accommodate a range of mission systems. The family of Fuchs 2 vehicles includes an NBC protection vehicle, reconnaissance, C4I command, control, communications and intelligence, C3I, mortar carrier and an electronic warfare vehicle.<br>FUCHS 2 WEAPONS SYSTEMS<br><br>The Fuchs 2 can be fitted with a range of weapon systems including a Rheinmetall E8 turret or Rheinmetall low weight RLS 609 weapon station. The E8 turret can be armed with missiles, a 30mm cannon and a 7.62mm machine gun.<br><br>The RLS 609 station can be fitted with a 12.7mm machine gun or 40mm grenade launcher for self defence against soft or light armoured vehicles and hostile airborne systems. The RLS 609 provides low noise levels during firing and minimum carbon monoxide concentrations. A remote controlled RLS 609 is equipped with a CCD camera, liquid crystal display monitor and joystick control for operation of the weapon systems from within the vehicle.<br>FUCHS 2 ARMOUR STEEL MONOCOQUE HULL<br><br>The armour steel monocoque hull provides all round 360Â° protection against 7.62mm armour piercing (AP) rounds at 0Â° obliquity. Window glass and vision blocks provide the same level of protection as the hull. Armour window shutters can be operated from inside the vehicle.<br><br>Add on armour kits, supplied by IBD, provide protection against 12.7mm and 14.5mm armour piercing rounds, artillery fragments, anti-tank and anti-personnel mines (increasing vehicle weight and consequently decreasing payload). A passive armour kit over the frontal arc provides protection against 30mm Armour Piercing Discarded Sabot (APDS) rounds.<br><br>The vehicle can be fitted with an intercom and radio, driver's and commander's night vision system, an integrated global positioning system and vehicle navigation set.<br><br>Access to the driver's station is via two side doors. Troops have fast access to the crew station by two outward opening rear doors or via a rear ramp door. The rear ramp is power operated. The crew and driver can also use two roof-mounted hatches.<br><br>With the optional amphibious suite, the vehicle is able to enter and exit water by steep banks and is fully amphibious. The rear of the vehicle is fitted with two Schottel propellers which can turn through 360Â° and give a water speed of 10km/h.<br><br>The vehicle is equipped with a Nuclear, Biological and Chemical warfare (NBC) protection system.<br>TE20 DIESEL ENGINE<br><br>The MTU 6V 199 TE20 diesel engine is fitted with direct fuel injection, an exhaust gas turbocharger, liquid cooling and electronic engine management system. The engine is rated 315kW at 1,800rpm.<br><br>The ZF 6 HP602 six speed, fully automatic transmission has an integrated retarder, an STV 502 primary gearbox and STU 13000 secondary gearbox.<br><br>The axles on the Fuchs 2 have been upgraded to carry higher wheel loads. It is possible for the driver to activate the differential locks longitudinally and latitudinally whilst on the move. A pressure control valve on the third axle prevents axle blockage during manoeuvres involving emergency braking.<br><br>Steering is controlled via a LS7FS Daimler Chrysler gearbox and connecting steering rods to the first two axles. The 14.00 - 20 radial tyres can be optionally fitted with run flat capability. A Central Tyre Inflation System (CTIS) ensures the Fuchs 2 retains mobility in the event of damage to one or all tyres.<br><br>The fuel system includes two bullet-proof, self sealing rubber bladder tanks installed in the sides of the welded hull in armour steel housings.<br><br>ELECTRICAL POWER<br><br>The vehicle has a 24V electrical system with four 200Ah batteries and a 6.5kW generator. The CAN standard SAE J 1939 digital electrical system provides vehicle status data and details of component failure to the Driver Information System.</div>
