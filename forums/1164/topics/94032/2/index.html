Though it may be a legitimate measure, it would be unwise to carry out such a course of action. It undermines the confidence of commercial shipping through our waters and our economy will suffer if these shipping companies decide to reroute to other shipping lines where the navy ships don't fire on anyone that stray too close. Such a scenario does not bode well for a nation that relies heavily on trade.</div>

What is all this fuss by Malaysia over Pedra Branca?<br><br>A. <strong>The dispute arose in 1979, when Malaysia for the first time published a new map which claimed the island. Prior to that, Singapore had occupied and exercised full sovereignty over the island for more than 150 years since the 1840s without any protest from Malaysia. Previous Malaysian maps, even as late as 1974, showed Pedra Branca as belonging to Singapore. </strong> <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br><br>Following the recent International Court of Justice's decision in favour of Malaysia over Indonesia regarding the disputed islands of Sipadan and Ligitan, Malaysia began to accuse Singapore of delay over the Pedra Branca issue. Malaysia also falsely accused Singapore of building new structures on Pedra Branca even though no new structures have been built there for the last 10 years.<br><br>Q. Has Singapore delayed putting the dispute on Pedra Branca before the International Court of Justice (ICJ)?<br><br>A. No. In fact, as early as 1989, it was Singapore which first proposed to resolve Malaysia's claim through the ICJ process. Malaysia agreed to this in 1994 and both countries settled on the text of a Special Agreement to refer Malaysia's claim to the ICJ in 1998. But Malaysia made no serious attempt to pursue the signing and ratification of the Special Agreement to start the process until recently.<br><br>Q. Why is Singapore chasing away Malaysian vessels from Pedra Branca? Does Malaysia not have a right to patrol at Pedra Branca before the International Court of Justice's ruling?<br><br>A. Singapore has exercised exclusive control and sovereignty of Pedra Branca since the 1840s. This is the status quo. Until Malaysia's claim is decided by the ICJ, the status quo must remain.<br><br>In fact, Malaysia took this same position against Indonesian naval intrusions over the Sipadan and Ligitan dispute. In that case, Malaysia took the position that as they were in possession of the islands, the status quo should prevail. But Malaysia now conveniently disregards the status quo in the case of Pedra Branca by intruding into Singapore waters.<br><br></div>
