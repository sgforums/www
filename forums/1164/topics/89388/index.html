            <div class='col-md body'><strong>rest assured Mod, there's nothing sensitive about this topic...</strong><br><br>there was an extremely heart wrenching story featured in the NY Times some months ago about an israeli youth with a Jewish mother and a Palestinian father...<br><br>the parents divorced on paper so that the mother could bring the child to Israel where there was a better future. the youth grew up and served in the IDF, while the dad came in as an illegal immigrant, washing dishes at a restaurant just so that he could be near his son.<br><br>one day, he was caught and due to be deported. he managed to inform his son and the son raced off in an IDF jeep to the border check-point and managed to meet his dad before they escorted him over the borders.<br><br>the soldiers escorting the poor man took one look at his son's Sergeant rank and decided to look the other way while the son drove his dad home.<br><br>last heard, "special provisions" were being sought for the dad to stay... but one should realise that this is no isolated incident.<br><br>the divide is not between jews and muslims... there are great complexities on the ground and the grey areas are very broad indeed...<br><br>when we talk about Jews or Muslims, we should remember that we are talking about PEOPLE, not categories.<br></div>
