In other words, the religion is called Judaism &amp; the ppl who practise it are called Jews. Just like the religion is called Buddhism, Christianity or Islam, and the ppl who practise it are called Buddhists, Christians or Muslims respectively.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>i believe there is elements in the Palestinian people that opposes the suicide bobmbing method. Not that i encourages nor agree to suicide bombers you must think that what drives this people to do this... clerics or the sight of their houses being torn down by IDF bulldozers, or the fact they are living in refugees camps for a past few decades. The Jewish people also started out with terrorism.. the Hagnanah is one example. The group which bomb the King David hotel to force Brits to leave Israel decades ago. You must think the cause before you comdemn the whole Palestinain ppl of violence</div>
