It'll usually smooth out after a few thousand rounds, but will never approach the silky-smooth pull and crisp break of the trigger on a well-broken-in CZ 75B, <span style="font-style: italic;">unless</span> a trigger job is performed.<br><br>You can lighten both the DA and SA trigger pulls by replacing the stock 20 lb. hammer mainspring with a lighter one from <a href="http://www.gunsprings.com" rel="nofollow">Wolff Gunsprings</a>. A 17 lb. mainspring would be my recommendation, as a 16 lb. one (the lightest available) might not give the hammer enough energy to reliably ignite some of the harder primers found on 9mm milsurp ammo.<br><br>Swapping in a lighter mainspring doesn't require the dec<span style="font-style: italic;"></span>ocker mechanism to be disassembled. It will reduce the trigger effort, but not smooth out the trigger pull. For that, you'll need to perform a full-blown trigger job. The P-01's dec<span style="font-style: italic;"></span>ocker mechanism is, unfortunately, a real b!tch to disassemble, and  makes trigger jobs a real PITA. I've done repair work on a number of CZ's dec<span style="font-style: italic;"></span>ocker models, but am currently <span style="font-style: italic;">not</span> set up to do trigger jobs on them.<br><br>To get a complete trigger job on your P-01, you have the following options.<br><br>1. Send it back to <a href="http://www.cz-usa.com" rel="nofollow">CZ-USA</a> and have their resident gunsmith, Mike Eagleshield, work on it. Do note that Mike is perpetually backlogged and you might have to wait 6 to 8 weeks for the work to be done.<br><br>2. Send it to <a href="http://www.ghostholster.com" rel="nofollow">Angus Hobdell</a> for the trigger job. Angus is a full-time CZ-sponsored competitive shooter who travels to matches all the time, so he's not always available to work on guns.<br><br>3. Send it to Jim Miossi at <a href="http://www.miossigunworks.com" rel="nofollow">Miossi Gun Works</a>. Jim is also another CZ-certified gunsmith.<br><br>If you're looking for custom wood grips for your P-01, take a look at the offerings by <a href="http://www.czgrips.us" rel="nofollow">Omega Custom Grips</a>. Sam's work is outstanding, and I have his grips installed on a number of my pistols.<br><br>Hope that helps!<br><br>MG</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>HI Shotgun!<br><br>Here is a link of how the gun strip apart ! the main difference is that now you have a piston opening in the front below the front sight, twist it and you get a gas plug and than a piston rod. the bolt carrier is modify now without the gas tube connector and the bolt does not have the gas seal ring.<br><br>Look at the picture below and you will have a better picture. They also took out the front sight tower and mount a detachable front sight ! I am changing mine to a flip up and down version becasue it is blocking my electronic sight ! I will use the iron sight as a backup!<br><br><a href="http://www.pof-usa.com/P-416/P-416upper.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.pof-usa.com/P-416/P-416upper.htm</a><br><br>DaveC</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hi Dave!<br><br>Can you please talk about the fluting on the barrel?<br><br>I looked at the website briefly and I saw one upper which had what was called a "continuous fluting". The fluting on yours is different.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hi Moca<br><br>Basically the Continous fluting and mine is just a slight differnce... MIne has a M203 cutout notch just like what an M4 does! kind of asthetics to me since I am not putting a M203 on the gun.  The continous flute just have a straight flute cut out on the barrel.<br><br>The FLutes help to disipate heat out of the barrel thus accelerate cooling ... it really helps in getting mroe consistant shot when the barrel is hot hot.. and you can do more shots before have to let the barrel cool down...<br><br>DaveC!</div>
