            <div class='col-md body'>No, the so call "assualt weapon" ban is over , Now in most of the Free State (excluding some like People's Republic of California, New York, New Jersey etc) as long as the assualt weapon is made in the US, we can buy these weapons without restrictions.<br><br>Infact the ban was a joke becasue they deem an assualt weapon as one that has a flash hider, bayonet lug, ablity to shoot semi auto, pistol grip, folding stock.  and to make it legal at that time you can only have 2 or 3 of the items! During the ban, say you take an Ar15 and take out the bayonet lug, flashhider ! it somehow become not an assualt weapon.<br><br>Anyway! the importation of assualt weapon is still on! So! we still cannot buy say a German HK G36 or somthing like that! However, foreign company is comming to built the weapon here in the US! like FN has their P90 and P2000 bullpup, SIG is releasing a US version of their SIG 55x series rifle, heard Steyr would do likewise!<br><br>Its all so political, and the sad thing is the people who write these rules have no understanding of firearms whatsoever and that is the SAD part.<br><br>DaveC!</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>HI tankee1981<br><br>Yes! I shot the U100,M249 .... comparing these rifles my piston M4 is much lighter... thus in FA the controllability is not as good! the bipod on my gun is a lightweight type thus not as strong and robust as the SAW type! again! we are comparing apples and oranges!<br><br>the M4 piston is more of a handheld , short barrel carbine ... it handles better as that! it is lightwesight , nimble and much better as a CQB to midrange type engagement ! I did up to 400 yds and it perform remarkerbly.   but as a SAW comparing to our U100 and M249 it will never be ! 1st there is no quick change barrel like a SAW to change out the barrel when it is hot, the reliability of drum magazines like the betamag is still questionable ( had a few freinds from the sandbox and they commented on the Beta, RPK drum mags and all that_) the rate of fire on my gun is tone down to 600 rpm! so! it is not as hi as say a M249 which for SAW I think higher ROF is a little better IMHO.<br><br>It handles very well! I would compare this over the exsisting M16A2, M4 type rifle and it runs much cleaner, not as hot, and handles , accurwacy is as good as any M4! but much more reliable.<br><br>Again! to me ! a SAW needs to be belt fed! its a much more efficient system ! I hate loading the Betamags and also! I remeber our U100 drum needs a special machine to load FULL!<br><br>Yes! this one is registered as a Class 3.. so! it has Safe, Semi and FUN!<br><br>DaveC!</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hi MOca<br><br>the sight is EOtech 552 with Night vision ... it has a holographic sight projected on the screen.. the holographic projection is a circle with a dot in the center.. i think the dot is .65 MOA!... it has many settings to brighten or dim the system!<br><br>I like the EOtech better than the AImpoint ML beecasue it is not just a dot! and it has a wider FOV! rather than looking into a tube !you have a big flat head up display type ! WOrks better in CQB in all ways!<br><br><a href="http://www.eotech-inc.com/index2.php" rel="nofollow">http://www.eotech-inc.com/index2.php</a><br><br>DaveC</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Yea Yea Dave,<br><br>With all that firepower in your hands in a firefight, you will be the centre of attraction. Enemy wud throw at you JDAMs, 155s and the kitchen sink - if all these were available at an instant's notice - otherwise, you will have GMPGs RPKs RPGs mortars 84s thrown at you.  Good luck in your next firefight.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>YEah! we are comparing a rifle system! not comparing full blitzkreig combine arms operations??<br><br>ANyway! you can go to a firefight with a knife or with your barehands.... its your choice... Having a 100rd mags and 3 or 4 thirty round mags don;t make you a center of attention ! but still is your training, actions that dictates the outcome.<br><br>Wonder what is his point!???? or what is his problem???<br><br>Anyway! no hard feelings!<br><br>DaveC <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"></div>
