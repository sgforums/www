They added that if the system is approved, it can be operational within 18 months.<br><br>The project was dropped about a year and a half ago, despite several successful tests and in spite of repeated rocket attacks from Lebanon and the Gaza Strip, but Public Security Minister Avi Dichter has been enlisted to spearhead the effort to resurrect Skyguard by a strong lobby group, including former defense ministry officials, that has developed.<br><br>To address the threat from Palestinian Qassam rockets, Prime Minister Ehud Olmert and then-defense minister Amir Peretz approved the development of an alternative missile-defense system which is based on intercepting rockets rather then laser beams. The missile interceptor, named Iron Dome ("Kipat Barzel" in Hebrew), was to be developed by Rafael, the national authority for the development of weapons and military technology, and completed within three years.<br><br>Olmert and Peretz's decision to go ahead with the Iron Dome project was made in conjunction with the Defense Ministry's recommendation to develop the system in Israel, and facilitated by the fact that<strong> a foreign country agreed to allocate considerable funds toward developing the system. </strong><br><br>However, the pro-Skyguard group argued that Skyguard was nearly completed, requiring minimal further investment to make it operational. They urged Dichter to persuade other decision-makers to approve the resumption of its development in addition to the Iron Dome project. They added that the combination of both systems would yield optimal results.<br><br>Supporters of reviving the laser-based project pointed out that it had passed performance tests in the U.S. with flying colors, registering a successful interception rate of nearly 100 percent. Northrop Grumman Space Technology's Skyguard is an advanced derivative model of the Tactical High Energy Laser (THEL/Nautilus) project. Initially, the project was launched in 1996 by Israel and the U.S., and was meant to counter Hezbollah's 122mm Katyusha rockets.<br><br>http://www.haaretz.com/hasen/spages/888921.html<br><br>Skyguard or related pictures;<br><br><a href="http://www.defense-update.com/images/skyguard.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://www.defense-update.com/images/skyguard.jpg</a><br><br><a href="http://www.israeli-weapons.com/weapons/missile_systems/systems/thel5.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://www.israeli-weapons.com/weapons/missile_systems/systems/thel5.jpg</a><br><br><a href="http://www.israeli-weapons.com/weapons/missile_systems/systems/thel2.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://www.israeli-weapons.com/weapons/missile_systems/systems/thel2.jpg</a></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Could not agree more Gary. In most cases, India and Singapore are likely suspects.<br><br>But why would the Indians need this? They have an entire sub-continent to fall back on and thier capital and key cities and industries are far away from any rocket strikes.<br><br>It would seem that the `Iron Dome' would be useful against rocket barrages from short ranges where higher altitudinal surface to air missiles could not counteract because the rockets are fired from close range and fly too low.<br><br>The Qassams have a range of 4-17 km while the Katyusha have a max range of &gt;20 km. If Singapore truly partakes in this project, did our military commanders see an insidious threat from the ongoing conflict in Israel?<br><br>Or did our military planners see a unique opportunity in influencing the design of a cheap system to counter-act inaccurate rocket barrages leaving our more expensive surface to air missiles to deal with more expensive and accurate cruise missiles and the like ?<br><br>Interestingly, Ehud Barak is now in charge and pushing for the system. We have extremely close relations with this `fella.' We co-funded and co-founded the Barak system and it is called the Barak missile system. If you could recall, George Yeo visited Israel not too long ago. His visit was reciprocated by the Israeli deputy prime minister`s (? one of the minister) visit just recently.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>My take on the possible 'foreign partners':<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">China</span><br>=&gt; Not very likely unless Tel Aviv want to incur Washigton's wrath again, remember the Harpy incident?<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">India</span><br>=&gt; Possible.  But doubt so, the Indians is more interested in anti-ship defences eg improved Barak + deep penetartion weapons into the Chinese heartland.<br>=&gt;  The Skyguard seems to be laser-base, geared towards counter those Katuysha/ Qassam/ Mortar type of rockets.<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Singapore</span><br>=&gt; Highly Possible.  Given the slow proliferation of MLRS systems being introduced into this region  Coupled with the terror (or nuisance) effects rained onto densely populated areas.<br>=&gt; Astros-like MLRS are considered less shophistcated rockets (unguided) whereby one need to fire in salvos to ensure a decent damage to the enemy.  Therefore Astros-type arec considered more of a terror-type weapon.  Tactical yes, Strategic No.  As compared to the US MLRS system, 1 rocket = 1 target or multiple targets.<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">US </span><br>=&gt; Very Possible.  Given the mortar-type weapons being encountered by US troops in Iraq,  a long-term solution (or mobile) need to be found rather than the current cumbersome Land-based PHALANX.<br>=&gt; Given the sophistication of the SKYGAUARD, I doubt the Israeli defence industry will support this system indegeoiusly, US components techincal support+ components will play a part here.<br><br>But then, the above is my take.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote>The Skyguard seems to be laser-base, geared towards counter those Katuysha/ Qassam/ Mortar type of rockets.<br></blockquote>The Katuysha and Qassams fly low because they are rudimentary rockets which are launched from less than 20 km away and the flight time is shorter. I do not think that is the case with the Astross rockets. Moreover, it would be unlikely that the Malaysians would put thier Astross within that range since anything within 40 km from Singapore is within tube artillery fire from Singapore.<br><br>I am thinking that the SAF (if true) in getting involved in this project wants to distinguish unguided rockets from guided ones which are inherently dangerous. Hence, they are looking for a cheap system to counteract these unguided rockets if they come within our space and the space where our ground forces are occupying. We can leave cruise missiles to more sophisticated and expensive surface to air missiles. It is like you buy S400 missiles to shoot down a mere unguided Astross rocket? What a waste...<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>The Thel has indeed been proven to be effective in tests and the `Iron Dome' looks promising. The combination of the two system would be lovely. Hopefully, Singapore gets them. They can form an effective lower tier of protection. And we can invest in longer ranged systems like the Aster-30 SMPT, A400s, Meads, etc for middle and/to upper tier protection.<br><br>In the past, we do not need longer ranged surface to air missiles as the 40 km  I-hawks and our RSAF interceptors are sufficient. However, the advent of more sophisticated cruise missiles in our region would highly likely change that situation. I am confident that the SAF would be buying an upper tier system not just to stop ballistic missiles(like what Defence Minister Teo Chee Hean says) but other aerial threats as well.</div>
