What is this? 2 of each type? How is TNI going to maintain these 2 different types (albeit they have common parts). Furthermore, only 4 aircraft - to do what? If 1 crash then what's going to happen?<br><br>Now they are going to be operating 2 different types russian jets of 2 each, 12 F-16s, skyhawks, etc. It sounds even worse than RMAF purchases.  Why don't they stick to only either the Su27 or the SU-30 but instead having to buy 2 of each. This is really funny.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I just dont see why they should purchase 2 Su-27 and Su-30, 2 multi-role aircraft performing the same roles of air superiority and ground attack. In fact Indonesia had cancelled an order for 12 Su-30 in the late 1990s citing financial problems.<br>The new purchase and probably later purchases of Su-27/30 could be to replace their F-16s which are down due to lack of spares or maybe their aging A-4.</div>

Sure Aceh and the surronding sea has oil.But the bad thing is Aceh is under rebellion and ofcause the 1st thing they'd attack is the petrol plants thus they cannot fully develop that area due to lower investors confidence in that country.Thus they do not have the money to even develop the fields themselves.....believe me the oil industry is very expensive to even go into.Sure they can trade palm oil like Malaysia but remember Malaysia is paying a bigger majority of the price in cold hard CASH while Indonasia doesnt have that much cash.....if you read defence articles they're hard pressed to even mantaint their army.Credits are not vaild due to the unstablilty of the country.Same thing with the banks are not going to lend you money if you're working as a temp and ou cash input is not constant....it's all about balance of economies which as a sale manager you should understand....right?<br>But let's wait and see thats the best  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>Singapore doesnt really buy with cash...we license quite alot of it and build it ourselves.......and sometimes even sell it...<br>And yes Indonasia does produce alot of Natrual Gas(not alot of oil though)But with that amount of corrouption do you think they are getting alot of the gas money??i hardly doubt it.....and the Exxon plants there are operating but barely....also they have not been able to expend nor look for new wells due to the unrest.The Indonasian goverment cannot use oil to barter trade due to the fact that the oil can only be given out to companies and not the country.They have to give the oil rights to indian companies and trade deals thats the only way.Oh and Singapore also does offer trade deals and other stuff for the hardware</strong><br><br>Oh I am sure we license/build lots of stuff. But not aircraft. And definately not the good stuff that we are planning to procure like the JSF.<br><br>As for CASH, I don't mean we pay everything up front. but we do not have other barter goods in exchange for our arms purchases. What does the USA/Isreal want from Singapore that is not produced elsewhere (we buy it first &lt;--- cash outflow, assemble and sell to USA) That is different from Malaysia/Indonesia who are growing the palm oil and processing it in country. (ZERO cash outflow)<br><br>There is tons of corruption in Indonesia. And some of the most corrupted people there are the generals (why do you think there are so many of them) Hence that is why I believe that they have the money, and can pass any possible parlimentary law to procure the equipment.<br><br>Despite having the troubles, the Exxon Mobil plant is still able to process the natural gas. I do admit that it is on a reduced capacity, mut none the less, its only temporary (a few years is still temporary compared to the life of their contract)<br><br>You may be right that the oil may not be used for barter trade, but I don't see why not .. after all, Pertamina, who is the Indonesian Oil Company is able to do the trading. They can sell the oil directly to India at barter trade prices, and hence both sides get a good deal.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Do not underestimate the "true value" of Indonesia. By right with all these resources, Indonesian people should deserve higher standard of living, like Brunei.<br><br>Some figures for your brian cells....too many to list them out<br><br>Irian Jaya - the world largest gold, copper and other weird precious metal deposits (Freeport operate the world largest gold mine est 400 billion USD of gold just for a single glasburg mine). This piece of virgin land is thought to hold a huge proportion of the world gold reserve.<br><br>Arch - tons and tons of natural gas and oil.<br><br>Java - Sulphur and other odd resources to make your explosives<br><br>You may ask why they got so much free earthly resources and the answer is their woes is also their gains. You see Indonesia happens to lie in the rings of fire and all those "pukes" from inner earth spill out to the surfaces from time to time, killing the people and replenish the natural resources (gold, copper, sulphur ores..)<br><br>BTW me thinking of going to Irian Jaya (quite a scenic place) to hunt for gold, hope I won't get eaten by native headhunters <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Indonesia is rich in natural resources. However, there is so much corruption there that the money is not going to the poor people. The rich are very rich (I read that some Indonesian tycoon actually owns Lambourgini company) The Chinese in Indonesia has loads more money than we Singapore Chinese. So the problem is not that Indonesia is poor, its a mismatch in the living standards of their people.<br><br>Also, there are logistic problems that will be nightmare for anyone. Imagine trying to distribute rice to all their islands. And just getting a maid from Indonesia is a nightmare .. my Malaysian relatives maid came from some small village in Java, she travelled to Jakarta, then to the west tip of Java, then took a ferry to Sumatra, up to some port, and a ferry to Malacca, and finally to KL. That trip took 1 week. So unlike Singapore (which is small) and KL (which has nice highways), the Indonesians have more logistical problems.<br><br>Compared to Brunei, of course Indonesia looks bad. But I just had some friends in from Brunei. The picture is not that bright there also. Although the bruneians have a PPP GDP per cap equal to Singapore (or even higher), BSB is like Kuala Trengganu or Kota Bahru. Boring. People there are even more conservative than the PAS members. its because the Brunei sultanate suppress all opposition that they don't complain.<br><br>When Malaysia banned Daredevil, the Brunei govt followed suit. And for good measure, banned The Matrix II &amp; III (because the evil villian is named Allah I think)<br><br>Also, there may be no taxes and health care is free and the oil there can last 50 more years .. but already, there is something brewing there. Did you know that Bruneians who are sent to Britain on govt scholarship are also discriminated? Those close to the royal family can study degrees. Those bright but without any connection can only do "higher diplomas" .. talk about discrimination.</div>
