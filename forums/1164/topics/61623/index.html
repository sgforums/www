            <div class='col-md body'>Straits Times, Monday, 10 November 2003, reported that RSAF Training Group in Cazaux, France will be using new high tech satellite linked equipment in their dog-fight training, so as to get immediate reviews of each individual's performance.<br><br><a href="http://straitstimes.asia1.com.sg/singapore/story/0,4386,219141-1068501540,00.html?" rel="nofollow">http://straitstimes.asia1.com.sg/singapore/story/0,4386,219141-1068501540,00.html?</a><br><br><strong><span class="large">'Action replays' to get pilots up to speed in dogfights </span><br>Singapore's trainee pilots in France will have access to device that records their planes' positions in air battles for review </strong><br><br>By David Boey<br><br>TO TRAIN Singapore's fighter pilots better, an electronic device that captures every position they take during mock air battles will be introduced to their flight training in France from early next year.<br><br>Called Air Combat Manoeuvring Instrumentation (ACMI) pods, they are fitted under the wings of the warplanes to record, via satellite, each fighter's location.<br><br>Later, at debriefings, trainees get a clear view of how well they did in the mock air battle, especially when several fighters are performing high-speed manoeuvres.<br><br>The pod is one of several devices the Republic of Singapore Air Force (RSAF) is considering.<br><br>Said Lieutenant-Colonel Sim Kim Yong, Commander of 150 Squadron: 'We want to look at basic ACMI equipment like pods, antennas and television monitors as debriefing tools. This will allow us to conduct better debriefings.<br><br>'You can point out students' mistakes, their correct moves. From there, they can visualise air combat manoeuvres a bit more clearly.'<br><br>The training at Cazaux Air Base in south-west France involves Super Skyhawk fighter-bombers: 16 single-seat A-4SU and double-seat TA-4SU planes modified as advanced jet trainers.<br><br>The ACMI pods, which resemble air-to-air missiles, are hung on weapons pylons under the wings of the Super Skyhawks.<br><br>Cazaux is where the RSAF trains its fighter pilots. About 150 RSAF personnel are based there, including close to a dozen pilot trainees.<br><br>These trainees stay between six and nine months before they graduate as fighter pilots.<br><br>Before France, they receive their basic flight training on S.211 jet trainers in Australia, at the Royal Australian Air Force base in Pearce, near Perth.<br><br>A posting in France is also available to full-time national servicemen. Four of them are currently at Cazaux on a two-year posting.<br><br>Apart from training, the detachment at Cazaux also allows Singapore pilots to fly there for joint air defence exercises hosted by the French Air Force with NATO air forces involving sometimes as many as 17 European countries.<br><br>The 'extra' trainees receive in the Cazaux training programme is exposure to a range of weather conditions and procedures used by different air forces, said LTC Sim.<br><br>'For example, the air traffic controllers speak English but because of the different accents, sometimes they don't understand what our Singaporean pilots are saying. And sometimes we don't understand the French speaking English.<br><br>'But over time, we get to know and understand and learn from each other.'<br><br>Another plus is the vast training ranges over the Atlantic Ocean - about 160km long and 65km wide - located just five minutes by air from Cazaux.<br><br>This compares favourably to training over the South China Sea, where about 30 per cent or 18 minutes of an hour's flight training is spent reaching the training area.<br><br>Instructors at Cazaux also have the use of air-to-ground ranges which allow trainees to fire the Skyhawk's 20mm cannon or attack land-based targets with bombs. These ranges span an area about the size of Ang Mo Kio and Toa Payoh combined, said LTC Sim.<br><br>He also expressed confidence that the training will help pilots master more advanced fighters such as the F-5S/T interceptor and F-16C/D multi-role fighter.<br><br></div>

Theres no need for fixed ACMI stations, all parameters are measured by the pods and downloaded into computers back at base when the aircraft returns.<br><br>Any aircraft thats capable of carrying the AIM-9 is compatible with the system. IIRC other than Singapore the RAF and the RNZAF (when they had combat capability) used this system</div>
