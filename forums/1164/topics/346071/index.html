              <p class="intro"><em><strong>ONE
                  hundred Royal Australian Navy submariners will be flown around the
                  world at taxpayers' expense in coming weeks to conduct submarine escape
                  training, despite those training facilities existing at their base in
                  Perth.</strong></em></p>
              <p><em>Their $2.3 million business-class trip
                  comes as a confidential audit report on the management of the navy's
                  Collins Class submarines, obtained by The Weekend Australian, delivered
                  a damning assessment of submarine escape and rescue services, saying
                  they were unsafe, unreliable and had been mismanaged. </em></p>
              <p><em>The navy is flying its submariners from Perth to Halifax on Canada's
                  east coast because of a bungled Defence Department tender that left it
                  unable to use its $25 million facility for pressurised escape training
                  at HMAS Stirling in Perth. </em></p>
              <p><em>The pressure escape training facility, described on navy's website
                  as "the most advanced of its kind in the world today", has not been
                  used since last May after a tender dispute between the navy and the
                  Australian Submarine Corporation. </em></p>
              <p><em>With the facility lying idle, the navy has been forced to send its
                  submariners overseas to receive pressurised training on how to exit a
                  stricken submarine at depths of up to 180m. </em></p>
              <p><em>The escape training is mandatory for all new submariners and all
                  qualified submariners must take a refresher course every three years. </em></p>
              <p><em>"Plans are presently in place to requalify up to 100 sailors in Canada in the near term," a Defence Department spokesman said. </em></p>
              <p><em>"Canada was identified as the best option as it meets the
                  pressurised training requirements and has the training capacity to meet
                  Australian needs within the designated timefame." </em></p>
              <p><em>The taxpayer-funded trip is the result of a dispute between the navy
                  and ASC last year, which has left the navy with no contractor to manage
                  its submarine escape training facility in Perth. </em></p>
              <p><em>A forthcoming audit report is expected to be highly critical of the management of submarine escape and rescue services. </em></p>
              <p><em>The Australian last month revealed there was no viable rescue
                  equipment in Australia to help stricken submariners because the
                  equipment had failed to gain safety certification. </em></p>
              <p><em>A leaked draft report by the Australian National Audit Office goes
                  further, citing serious shortcomings in management, procedures and
                  equipment, which have undermined the prospects of a successful
                  submarine rescue. </em></p>
              <p><em>A draft version of the report, due to be tabled in parliament in
                  coming months, cites the findings of an internal navy safety study that
                  admits "a robust safety management system is not in place" for
                  submarine rescue. </em></p>
              <p><em>For deep-sea submarine rescues, the navy uses a 16.5-tonne rescue
                  vehicle called Remora, which attaches to the sunken submarine and
                  brings six survivors at a time to the surface. </em></p>
              <p><em>The <span style="color: #ff0000;">Remora is</span> in storage after it failed to regain its safety
                  certification after an <span style="color: #ff0000;">accident off t</span>he coast of Perth in December 2006
                  when a snapped cable caused two men to be trapped inside the vessel for
                  12 hours at a depth of 140m. </em></p>
              <p><em>The draft ANAO report says Remora has previously been subjected to unauthorised alterations and inadequate maintenance. </em></p>
              <p><em>At present, any stricken Collins Class submarine would have to wait
                  until a rescue vehicle was brought out from Britain, raising doubts
                  about whether it could be deployed in time to save the lives of the
                  crew.---EOQ</em></p>

              <blockquote>The haunting tale of the Kursk is one the Royal Australian Navy vowed would never happen to it.
              <p>Just as Australia had built and operated its own unique fleet of
              Collins class submarines, this country would create and manage its own
              submarine rescue service.</p>
              <p>History tells us that the Collins class boats, after some big
              initial problems, are a success and form a critical plank in the
              nation's defence.</p>
              <p>But the story of the submarine rescue service is far less glorious.</p>

              <p class="intro"><strong>FORMER
              submariner Stuart Weymouth wants to know why the Royal Australian Navy
              is flying 100 submariners to do escape training in Canada when he can
              train them more cheaply at home in Perth.</strong></p>
              <p>The
              former chief instructor at the navy's now-dormant Submarine Escape
              Training Facility at HMAS Stirling says he could gather a team of 12
              instructors immediately to train the submariners at a cheaper cost than
              the $2.3 million being spent to fly them to Canada.</p>
              <p>"If I made a few phone calls, I could get the whole lot lined up and ready to go," he said.</p>
              <p>"We have a world-class training facility here that is just lying idle -- it's crazy."</p>
              <p>The navy is flying the submariners to Canada to conduct the same
              pressurised escape training they would normally get at Perth's SETF,
              because a bungled Defence Department tender has left the $25million
              facility idle.</p>
              <p>The bungled tender has left Mr Weymouth and at least a dozen other
              instructors without jobs at the SETF, which has not been used for
              pressurised escape training since last May, after<span style="color: #ff0000;"> a dispute between the
              Defence Materiel Organisation and the Australian Submarine Corporation
              over a tender to manage the facility. </span></p>
              <p>The tender process collapsed after senior Defence officials
              <span style="color: #ff0000;">repeatedly changed</span> the specifications of the contract, causing friction
              with ASC and eventually prompting Defence to withdraw from the tender.</p>
              <p>With the SETF lying idle, the navy has been forced to send its
              submariners overseas because pressured escape training is an essential
              safety requirement.</p>
              <p>As a result, Mr Weymouth said Australia's highly specialised team of escape instructors were now searching for work.</p>
              <p>"Some of the instructors are applying for completely new careers,
              like jobs on the railways, and their skills will soon be lost," Mr
              Weymouth said.</p>
              <p>"This facility in Perth is world-class and has been purpose-built
              for the task, and it is much better value for money to train our
              submariners in Australia."</p>
              <p>Mr Weymouth said the SETF was built specially to train sailors to
              escape from Collins-Class submarines, and that the training in Canadian
              facilities would not be as effective.</p>
              <p>"They're being sent to Canada to train at a facility which is not up
              to the task, and which has not been purpose-built for our submarines.
              It's the same as hosing someone down with a hose and saying you've been
              in the ocean.</p>
              <p>"There is no facility elsewhere in the world which replicates our own submarine systems."</p>
              <p>After 19 years in the navy and 15 as an escape instructor, Mr Weymouth urged Defence not to cut corners on submarine safety.</p>
              <p>"In a submarine you don't have to be at war to have a problem.
              Submariners are entitled to the same level of safety, and that means
              doing the best training the Australian Government can provide.</p>
              <p>"We have the people and we have the facilities, but we just don't seem to have the will to make it happen."</p>
              <p>The navy has defended the Canadian trip as "a temporary measure" to
              maintain safety training in the wake of the collapsed tender, but has
              given no indication of when the Perth training centre will be used
              again.</p>
