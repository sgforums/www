So long ago, I can't remember the details - I think it was a disgrunted (probably mentally unstable) sub-ordinate who shot the sergeant (the CSM, I think) for 'tekan'ing him. This is about all i remember.<br>In the 1970's there was an MP who didn't check that he removed all 5 rounds from his revolver (he had 1 round still chambered in the .38 ) and shot and killed his buddy, thinking his revolver was not loaded. This was at the old Tanglin Mindef HQ across from Botanic Gardens and Gleneagles hospital. The bullet passed thru his buddy's body and ricocheted off a table (and left a deep mark) - hat table was still around when I served in the late 80's. The guy had to serve his time in DB until trial 2 years later and then more time in civilian jail. Our CSM told me this story as he was there.<br>Back to orig. post. When I was in NS, MPs were 'combat support'. Their wartime duties have been mentioned above already - security for Brigade/Div commander, guarding checkpoints along supply routes, rounding up stragglers (and send them back to frontline units) and guarding POWs. Although they are not combat units, MPs have come under fire in recent wars (famous one was during Tet Offensive in Vietnam).<br>Peacetime duties vary, depending on the unit posting and your clearance (check family background) - silent precision rifle drill, motorcycle cops, Detention Barracks, Istana guards, honour guards for visiting VIPs, guarding vital installations (such as Mindef HQ and certain hush-hush secured areas), and working for SIB. Working at Mindef HQ, I got to meet many govt ministers (except LKY), SAF and foreign generals (incl. Chair of US Joint Chiefs) and foreign dignitaries (George H. Bush, the father, when he was VP) when they visited.</div>

But in retrospect, IMHO most of us were just doing our jobs and not going overboard with our powers. Only those guarding DB were a bit more "ngiao" and less forgiving because some of the detainess were perpetual/habitual offenders - some were there for 10+ years (they come out, then AWOL from their unit and kenna charged and send back again repeatedly).<br><br><blockquote> No (real) offense intended as I do have a 3 very close friends whom were MPs.

In fact after School of Provost, I was posted to Mindef HQ (another command) and came back only periodically, so my NS period didn't overlap with yours. Yes, baton is very useful, including for self-defense. Hmm, I don't think I know your Sikh friend. Only Sikh I know was the CSM at Mindef HQ. Last time I checked, he (Amar Singh) is the current RSM of Provost. He can speak fluent Hokkien, whenever he tried to spot check on sentries at duty post (usually at 4 or 5am to see if we 'eat snake'), we said on our walkie-talkie "Bayi lai liao" or "Bao Tao lai liao" to warn the sentries. But he understood every time and the person sending the warning kenna extra duty.<br><br><blockquote> It was during this time I was on loan to your PROVOST CO and I saw that incident where 5 to 6 MP's got stripped of their ranks by CO personally.

I do know many senior officers at Mowbray have police/CID connections because the same camp also housed police dog and other investigation units. I remember being warned that the CO was very strict about law-breakers under his command. If anyone in the camp commit crime outside and kenna sentenced in civilian court, he swore he would throw the culprit into DB afterward after they return (double punishment). The CO was the most feared person in our camp, more than OC, CSM or even RSM.</div>

While I was at Mindef HQ, they frequently conducted spot checks at night (when everything should have been locked up), on anything that could lead to security breach - computer with sensitive material not turned off, file cabinets (w/ confidential stuff) not locked etc. Always had to have an MP as witness so the accused can't say the evidence was planted. Boy, it's hard to imagine this was nearly 20 yrs ago (reminds me I'm old). <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"></div>

I have been back almost yearly but for no more than 1 month each time, so I haven't had any reservist/ICT at all. (I'm writing this in the US right now). Not to say I won't serve, just haven't had the opportunity. Most of my batch boys told me they still had to go for ICT, as MP, practice stuff like manning POW camp.</div>
