            <div class='col-md body'>Well of coz the Air Defence would be no doubt defending, but our airspace is like so miniature. The bomb attack would unlikely be of small scale as the aim of the bomb attack would definitely to annihiliate KI's and mass numbers of population. If your an attacker and wan it to be sudden with maximum effect, a huge scale bombing is more feasible as u can wipe out a very large number of men who are trained. 100 bomber planes divided into 4 waves will cause rather serious infrastructural and population damage.</div>

Let's see....<br><br>Malaysia is still the same, Singapore is still as small... That's means friend, we still have to move up north to fight!!<br><br>British wasn't full hearted? I guess the Malaysians will be more enthusiastic in defending their nation now but still their army is small... You mean we're gonna wait until their army retreated until JB before we mob?? TOo late...<br><br>Defence positions facing south?? You mean those few guns are gonna make a difference? Anyway, that's a WWII myth your history textbook told you cos those guns can traverse and fire to the north, except they had armour piercing shells for shooting ships instead of high-explosive against soldiers....<br><br>The difference is today, troops can move faster and have better intelligence, that means there's even less reason for Singapore to be caught unprepared...<br><br>Most important lesson learnt from WWII which is still very true today is:<br>The defence of Malaysia and Singapore is inseparable. If one falls, the other falls too...</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Okay, I'll bite into the revised speculative scenario. My response would be the same as Slywong's, with slight deviations.<br><br>1st - Make sure all family members are safe.......<br><br>&gt;&gt;&gt; Ditto.<br><br>2nd - call buddies/camp-mates/CSM/PL SGT etc etc....to verify and gather information on what happened......<br><br>&gt;&gt;&gt; No point. Word of mouth, while useful, can complicate the confusion. Instead, get access to the nearest radio, to get a sense of the whole picture &amp; also any SAF announcements. (Screw the codewords; they won't apply by then.)<br><br>3rd - Go back camp.......no need to wait for activation code or phone call liao since Singapore already under attack......<br><br>&gt;&gt;&gt; Hard to say. It's likely the standby forces would've been activated, followed by existing NS combat units, plus also reservist outfits who happen to be doing their ICT locally at that point in time. (I'm only roughly guessing here, cuz I don't have inside knowledge of whether the various DIV commands have contingency ORBATs for such emergencies.)<br><br>As for the reservists generally making their way back to camp, the pressing compulsion would be there but IMO not necessarily the "desperate urgency" - cuz some time is theoretically bought, with the ad-hoc vanguard forces already mobilized &amp; sent out. Possibly as long as 24 hours.<br><br>Also, I won't expect the subsequently-assembled outfits to be deployed to what they've been trained for. They may even be below-strength (why not?), with or without certain KAHs in place. It's also likely to be the PDF staff officers who'll take charge of the island defences, so supposedly frontline soldiers could be sent instead to guard installations/bridges, help distribute ammo, join the SCDF relief or just anxiously waiting in camps as reserve-contingency forces. Might even see the merging of certain units, so that the combined whole can be practically tasked for a functional assignment. Don't bank on doing things by rote or by the textbook.<br><br>Just do your best if we kena such a scenario. No one will begrudge you for taking a week or longer to report back, after seeing to &amp; settling personal affairs which are more important to you.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Arty bombardment ... &amp; we dunno where they're coming from? Kinda hard to suspend my disbelief that far.<br><br>He did mention "air raid siren", which suggests more of an aerial attack (&amp; which is precude to some sort of a land invasion). For this part, just close shop &amp; listen to the radio, lah - isn't that the mindset which the countless Civil Defence alarm-sounding on Saturday noons supposed to drill?<br><br>Indulge me; I didn't elaborate earlier on how our standby forces would react, but here's my take anyway:<br><br>1. The quickest-activated would be the RSAF &amp; the DA BNs (both to secure air superiority), followed by the recalling of RSN fortilla out patrolling. This aspect of the battle could drag on for days, even as the rest of the SAF mobilizes.<br><br>2. The standby ground-troops, while alert, aren't really that bountiful. They'll thus be deployed to dig in somewhere, but serve as frontline blocking positions against the perceived land invasion. Could be lots of scrambling around, depending on what intelligence the Joint Staff gets.<br><br>3. The NSF outfits would reinforce the standby forces, ready to take the fight to the enemy. Ditto the NSman outfits who happened to be attending ICTs. I suppose I'd better give a shout-out to the OCS &amp; BMTC/SISPEC batches as well. They'll be activated for battle; in particular, we'll need to withdraw the Tekong guys back to the mainland to prevent a siege there.<br><br>4. The civilian reservists, upon reporting, would be utilized accordingly - even if only to help out in disaster relief or logistics distribution. Would this mobilization aspect be super-prompt? I'm not that optimistic, since the affected guys have to make serious choices - which in a worse-case mentality is akin to abandoning their parents, leaving wifes to fend for themselves, &amp; possibly never see their children again. Won't put it past certain patriots joining the field-deployed personnel as pseudo-militia too, willing or enforced.<br><br>~shrugs~ That's how I foresee the SAF in such a crisis-management mode.<br><br>If anyone's interested in how we'll respond to an invasion, I recommend the SAF "Fighting Fit" coffeebook issued about a decade back (way before Douglas Chia's &amp; Wee Ee Mon's novels). It included a fictional short story that briskly namedropped, Tom Clancy style, our formations &amp; equipment (both a bit dated - it had us fighting with SAR-80's) as well as local landmarks against a force attacking from the east.<br><br>FWIW The narration centered around the Battle of Changi (IMO more like East Coast Parkway &amp;, supposedly, Marine Parade) &amp; more romantically, the Battle of Tekong (IMO more like Rocky Hill, with the recruits digged in &amp; waiting for the GDS to heli-drop in as support). The tale ends with a killer punchline of a coda, which I won't reveal here.</div>
