Assuming similar projectile weights, the 38 Special cartridge is actually somewhat less powerful than a 9mm cartridge. For example, a typical commercially-loaded 38 Special cartridge with a 125 gr. jacketed projectile clocks in with a velocity of around 1000 fps, while a 9mm cartridge with a 124 gr.

The 38 Special cartridge is 1/8" shorter than the venerable 357 Magnum, and revolvers chambered for the latter can also shoot the former (but not vice versa). Shot out of a 357 Magnum revolver, the 38 Special is actually a very comfortable and easy-shooting round, with virtually no recoil. There are also short-barrelled and highly concealable revolvers (like the popular Smith &amp; Wesson "AirLite" series) chambered specifically for the 38 Special, that are intended to be carried as self-defense weapons.<br><br>There are several revolvers on the market today chambered in calibers which are traditionally the domain of semi-autos--for example, Ruger and Taurus both sell revolvers chambered in 9mm and 45ACP. However, unless I am mistaken, the only semi-auto pistol available today that can fire revolver cartridges is the IMI Desert Eagle. There are versions of the DE that are chambered for the 357 Magnum and 44 Magnum cartridges (though I believe the former version is no longer manufactured).<br><br>Take a look at <a href="http://webpages.charter.net/dlwh/Cartridges_02.jpg" rel="nofollow">this image</a> to see the difference is size between the two cartridges. These are cartridges I currently handload; the 357 Magnum and 38 Special are sixth and seventh from the left, respectively.<br><br>MG</div>

Apparently, the SKS gives quite good accuracy inspite of the AK round - true? Where is your SKS made?

Its "reputation" for poor accuracy comes from its close association with the venerable AK-47, a rifle that was designed with operational reliability rather than raw accuracy in mind. Most AK-47s are built with relatively loose tolerances to allow them to continue functioning in the most adverse of conditions. For example, the fine dust encountered in a desert environment is less likely to cause an AK-47 to jam than a tight-fitting AR rifle. However, these loose tolerances wreak havoc with accuracy.<br><br>I can't speak for the accuracy of other SKS rifles, but the one in the image above is capable of <span style="font-style: italic;">reasonable</span> accuracy (sub-5" groups at 100 yards using the plain iron sights) with my reduced-power target handloads. That particular SKS is Yugoslavian; my other one is a Chinese model made by Norinco. In terms of durability, the Yugoslavian-made SKSes are generally considered the best, as they incorporate improvements to the original Russian design, such as thicker chamber walls and a more reliable gas piston system.<br><br>(Wow!

Generally, a greater sight radius improves the shooter's ability to aim the firearm accurately. Note that it doesn't make the firearm more accurate--it merely allows the shooter to make the most of the firearm's inherent accuracy.<br><br>Rifles like the SKS and AK-47 are built to relatively loose tolerances to enhance operational reliability, and in so doing, sacrifice accuracy. A longer sight radius will do little to improve the accuracy of such rifles. but they are plenty adequate to get the shot into the kill zone at normal engagement distances.</div>
