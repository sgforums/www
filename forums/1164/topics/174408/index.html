            <div class='col-md body'>IAF pilots have completed their mission training and fighter jets have been prepared for an Israeli attack on Iran, the British Sunday Times reported.<br><br>The article reported that "the elite 69 strategic F-15 I squadron" had been equipped with weapons that will be tested in combat for the first time, and that two missile submarines were on standby: one in the Persian Gulf and the second in Haifa Bay.<br><br>The Times also said that special IDF forces would be helicoptered into Iran to take out targets that could not be destroyed in an air strike.<br><br>Iran's nuclear facilities, according to the newspaper report, are widely dispersed at some 40 underground sites throughout Iran, which would make any attack by Israel - or any other nation - exponentially more difficult that Israel's successful attack on Iraq's Osirak nuclear reactor in 1981.<br><br>Col. [res] Ze'ev Raz, the former IAF pilot who led the Osirak mission, was quoted by the Times as saying, "What we now have is a lot of targets, which makes the operation much more difficult."<br><br>Raz believes an aerial assault on Iran's nuclear facilities is possible. There are many things that the IAF has done over the past few years that the public is not aware of, and it has made many important advances in mid-air refueling. Israel can strike the Iranian nuclear program, Raz said on Israel's Channel 1 TV's Politika program last week.<br><br>Former IDF Deputy Chief of Staff Uzi Dayan said last week that if Iran gets nuclear weapons, then so would terror organizations, like Hizbullah. "Israel needs to be ready to act on a military option," Dayan said. "Without getting into details, Israel is capable of doing these things."<br><br>When Dayan was head of the National Security Agency, he advised the government not to allow a situation in which Israel, and the world now finds itself, with a radical regime in Tehran on the verge of attaining nuclear weapons. Dayan laid much of the blame on the United States, which allowed this to happen. "The military option does exist, but only if the international community works together. The government that arises in Israel after the elections will have to deal with this issue," he said.<br><br>Shabtai Shoval, a former operative in the Israeli intelligence community, who wrote a book that Iran will reach nuclear weapons capability by 2009, says that covert action, for example by the Mossad, is the most interesting option, but would still not stop Tehran's push for nuclear weapons.<br><br>Dr. Reuven Pedatzur, a senior lecturer at the Strategic Studies Program at Tel Aviv University, believes Israel would be making a "disastrous strategic error" if it embarked on a full-scale attack on Iran's nuclear facilities. "The military option is not relevant, we simply don't have the right amount of intelligence and information; many of the targets are buried deep under ground.<br><br>Only if the Americans decide to do it, then that option is possible," Pedatzur said last week. Pedatzur added that the day Iran gets a nuclear weapon, Israel will have no choice but to abandon its policy of nuclear ambiguity.<br><br>Amir Mizroch contributed to this report.<br><br><a href="http://www.jpost.com/servlet/Satellite?cid=1136361083662&amp;pagename=JPost%2FJPArticle%2FShowFull" rel="nofollow">http://www.jpost.com/servlet/Satellite?cid=1136361083662&amp;pagename=JPost%2FJPArticle%2FShowFull</a></div>

Anyone remembered the cargo plane that crashed into an apartment block because it was rusty?...[/b]</blockquote>Whether the IRIAF is in terrible shape or not, I wouldn't dscount them out.  A lot of things had been discussed (particularly in the Western military circle) of the IRIAF - from its Tomcats being grounded to Tomcat strength down to just 10 or even non-existence - during the war with Iraq turned out to be erroneously wong.<br><br>I'm not a believer and definitely not a supporter of the Tehran regime but C'MON!  The post-Shah Iranian Army or even the fanatical Revolutionary Guards wouldn't be able to hold Saddam's army for 8 bloody long years w/o some decent air support (&amp; please! I'm not referring to divine help here) and esp w/o US support for their prevalent US-supplied equipments, wouldn't it?<br><br>In fact, given that Iranian C-130s is STILL flying w/o US support give credence to their ability and resilence.  Of course, there are always counter claims to their ability to fly and ability to maintain a decent IRIAF presence in the region.<br><br>On a last note, the IRIAF will not turn tail as compared to the Iraqi AF if challenged.  Btw, did you realised that the IRIAF Tomcats are <span style="color: red;"><strong>STILL FLYING</strong></span> (&amp; w/o US support for critical Tomcat spares).... IRIAF in poor shape?  You be the judge.<br><br></div>

Hopefully the next President elected will be <strong>moderate</strong>.[/b]</blockquote>Assasinating President Ahmadinejad or even his successor will not defuse the situation.<br><br>The next President being elected is a <strong>MODERATE</strong>?  I wouldn't count on it.  If the mullahs (esp Khameini) wanted a moderate President, they definitely wouldn't allow Ahmadinejad to win the Presidential elections (if you call that as elections!), or even allow him to stand in the first place.<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">"Perhaps they didn't expect him to be so radical</span>" you might say.  C'mon, Ahmadinejad IS FROM THEIR (MULLAH) OWN RANKS.  His radicalism was already pasted on the wall when he was a former Mayor of Tehran.  You think the Mullahs isn't aware of his record and his political leanings?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_confused.gif" alt="Confused" title="Confused"><br><br>Changing Ahmadinejad will not solve the Nuclear Problem.  <span style="color: brown;">The genie is out of the bottle</span>.  One thing is certain, the <span style="color: red;"><strong>MULLAHS WANT THE BOMB</strong> and this <span style="text-decoration: underline;">not negotiable</span></span>.  The whole thing about this EU talks with Tehran will not solve anything except buying time for the Irainians.  The Iranians knew that bringing the issue to the UN Security Council will not bear fruit which they knew is not popular with '2 of their friends there.'<br><br>Moscow and Beijing for their own skewed agendas/interests (political &amp; economic) and wanting to be the GOOD GUYS in front of the world, is courting everyone at risk.  The Mullahs will not be just restricting the BOMB within their borders and would glady share this with any Muslim group that Tehran sees as 'oppressed by infidels'.  Perhaps the Mullahs will repay Moscow's and Beijing's 'goodwill' here (UNSC) by sharing with 'oppressed groups' in troubled Chechnya and XinJiang province.... once that happens, perhaps we can rename Red Square as 'Red Dust'?  or the term 'Forbidden City' be extended to the whole of Beijing?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_twisted.gif" alt="Twisted Evil" title="Twisted Evil"><br><br>[/b]</div>

Perhaps an Allied strike on Iran in this instance will indeed be morally justifiable.[/b]</blockquote>Well said on this, huaichien!<br><br>"Allied Strike...moraly justifiable?"  The problem here is, <span style="font-style: italic;">who</span> is willing to join such a allied force for such a mission?  Even though the Saudis may not be comfortable and dread the idea of Tehran possessing such a weapon, I seriously doubt the Saudis (represented by their RSAF) would participate in such a 'grand coalition' unless Jeddah is able to deflect the historically conflict  of a Shiite-Sunni struggle.<br><br>Therefore, even though most of the ruling bodies of Gulf states may welcome such a coalition to take out Iran's nuclear facilities and the subsequent raid, they will not participate if requested.  That leaves only the US and the 'other democratic nation in the middle east'.<br><br>Thoughts anyone?</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Looking at the time line for the Iran Nuclear Programme, the Isreal is not likely to strike until the underground facility is near to full functioning status. A precision air strike at this stage, would sure cause serious damage to the nuclear programme hardwares, and more importantly the "brains" behind the entire nuclear programme.<br><br>This would kick back the nuclear programme by at least 10-20 years.</div>
