This is probably so you can wear the 6cm wide canvas belt.<br><br>In my experience the trousers are way too deep. When I wear them during combat training the top of the trousers always drop below the navel to hang around the hips. This means the crotch of the trousers drops down to somewhere midway between the crotch and the knees. This makes movement extremely difficult and I always have to hitch up my trousers during movement especially when I'm climbing up.<br><br>I have seriously considered fitting very wide cloth suspenders to my No4 trousers that hang on my shoulders.<br><br>In my opinion the No4 trousers should dispense with the need to wear a wide canvas belt so the trousers can be less deep and naturally fit around the hips instead of the navel. Or if the belt option must be retained then use a thinner 3cm belt like the No3 belt.<br><br>The 6cm belt is a really old-school and uncomfortable piece of kit anyway. A leftover from the British Army.<br><br>For boots I bought my own US-made Altama Jungle Boots. This is against the SAF law and the trainers always give me hell for it.

They are designed so that water doesn't flow in so easily and helps tremendously to let water out. In jungle training even brand new leather boots eventually let water in. But then the water doesn't come out after that. These eyelets also act as ventilation.<br><br>I had one in-camp where we did several days and nights of amphibious assaults sleeping on Seletar Island at night.
