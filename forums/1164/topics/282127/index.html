            <div class='col-md body'>I have extended family who are from Rangoon, they are on lock down,they are allowed only to do shopping under their blocks,then staright back inside their flats. It is very scary. Australians have been told not to travel to Myanmar for the next 6 months,and the American Government has threatened to intervene if things get worse. Our Australian news also reports that 3 monks have been bashed and shot to death in the streets, with police and the army using tear gas, grenades and brute force during PEACEFUL marches. What is wrong with our world??? I am ashamed to be a part of the human race, look at us....we kill each other in the streets....killing religious people for standing up for what they believe in!

            <div class='col-md body'>ozzy_gurl, sorry to hear that.  It is a military regime after all.<br><br>This is a rather strange protest to begin with.  Who are the monks rallying under?  I find it strange that there's no leader behind the protests at all. With the protests reaching to Aung San Suu Kyi's "residence", it almost seems as though they are trying to get her to step up in defiance to the military government.<br><br>I doubt a UN resolution that would force the military government to step down would ever be passed.  It is not that the democracies around the world doesn't care, but that there are 2 autocratic nations with veto powers that inhibit it.  China has strategic interests in Burma, and would well veto any move to a "regime change" in that country.<br><br>The effectiveness of UN is being questioned when it can't even act against what is obviously wrong and immoral because of the above mentioned.  If there is a time where a coalition of the willing is needed, its now.<br><br>On the other hand, I doubt whether Burma is ready for a full democracy after years of oppression.  Democracies typically take off well when the country is doing well, and level of public education is high.  While there have been many Burmese students that have fled overseas for their educations, there is little indication of many returning to their homelands.<br><br>Also, there have been many rumors and talks of Singapore's ties with the Military govt in Burma.  Many suggest that the ties are deep and that Sg has aided them in their oppression against their people.  Whether that is true, we don't really know.  However, there are indications of strong ties given the rather "neutral" statement by us.  I wonder, does that statement represent how the majority of Singaporeans feel about the situation there?</div>

It is very scary. Australians have been told not to travel to Myanmar for the next 6 months,and the American Government has threatened to intervene if things get worse. Our Australian news also reports that 3 monks have been bashed and shot to death in the streets, with police and the army using tear gas, grenades and brute force during PEACEFUL marches. What is wrong with our world??? I am ashamed to be a part of the human race, look at us....we kill each other in the streets....killing religious people for standing up for what they believe in!

Some Burmese exile in bangkok.. blame the expensive move of the Administrative capital from Yangon as the reason.. but those money saved will not last forever.. It was only stall the problem.

The general media is quick to equate the fuel protest to Democracy. The monks and nuns in no way indicating it so.  Look at CNA way of reporting the situation.. it is totally unbalanced and bias journalism .. they even dedicated 15 mins of their 1/2hrs news slot for it.. even invited Burmese Exile (likely C!A supported) for interview.<br><br>If one were to take note of CNA/Channel 5 reporting.. they are actually quite unbalance... when the myanmar police is shooting tear gas to disperse the protesters.. they using words like "no Qualm".. tactically equating tear gas to shooting live rounds. What are they suppose to use then ? Then, they were hundreds, then there were thousands, now there were tens of thousands. The general media is forcing the Juntas restrain.. but when the crowd reached a million... then what ? The media is setting up the junta for a TianAnMen Sq situation. In order to survive, the Junta will be forced to react... just like any other govt.<br><br>The media is propaganding that "should not use crackdown with violence".. then crackdown using what means ?  The Junta should surrender ? Effectively, would that mean a  regime change ? Again.. what has protesting against fuel height, to do with Democracy ? Of course, democracy groups will take advantage of the situation to join in, but are the monks saying that ? OR the media ?<br><br>Very unprofessional way of reporting. The general media is setting up the Myanmar for an TianAnmen situation. And not surprisingly, taking advantage of this protests, the US is urging for sanction. This is ridiculous, already the burmese suffering the fuel increase, and here, US is calling for sanction. .. Adding fuel to fire... aim to topple the Junta. Even better, install a pro-US democratically elected dictator. If you search US history... it is very familiar. Just like Iran is getting the Iraq treatment.<br><br>I am not a fan of the Junta.. but Myanmar must tread their own progress carefully.. and not along a civil war path. Also, I'm disappointed with CNA journalism.. I hope they are not part of the American propaganda news network.. but it seemed so.</div>

These point to the glaring discrepency between rich and poor from over 40 years of mismanagement by a string of  military dictators. I think the protests is a pressure-cooker phenomenon of this discrepency. The dictatorship may have to use increasingly bloodier force with each subsequent protest.<br><br><blockquote><strong><br>Coming back to the the monks protest.

Hence reporting has to be based on whatever info journalists can gather from abroad, which can be biased since there is no official channel for more accurate news. In the past (like the bloody clamp down in 1988 ) this has worked for them, but nowadays so many people can take photos/videos and send them worldwide by just a click, so the news restriction may work against them now.<br><br>The last time Burma had a budget surplus was the year before the military took over (in 1962). Burma has abundant natural resources, hardworking people, and there's potential for tourism, mining and other industries. There is no reason for it to lag so far behind other ASEAN nations.<br>The US and UK can't do much because they don't have much direct trade with Burma so the US is restricting travel visas of the Burmese elite, which is not going to hurt much (frankly, if Burma supplies 20% of the world's fuel, we might see carrier battle groups in the Andaman Sea right now). As I see it, China and India, Burma's biggest trading partners, should say something to the dictators. Even though China has been brutal in handling demonstrators, I believe the economic conditions in Burma are much worse than in China, with wages at under S$1 a day. China wants its immediate neighbours to be stable, this situation could lead to a bloody suppression and then foreign intervention of some sort, which is not good for China's interests as well.</div>
