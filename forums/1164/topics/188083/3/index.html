            <div class='col-md body'>As you meant the Naval version need not be ready before the year 2012-2013. That's when the Indian Aircraft carrier (ADS) will be ready. So they have a lot of time.<br><br>Also the Naval version is no different from the Airforce version except some structural changes. I.e its undercarriage need to be strengthened undercarriage, the nose will be slightly pointed downwards for better vision for the pilot. etc.<br><br>One can expect the Naval prototype after the trainer version prototype which is under construction.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hmmm..... Arjun, sorry for interrupting this thread but I think this thread is seriously going no where. Singapore already have a long history working on the F-16 from the a models to the D models. Why would RSAF go for a not battle tested, still in proto typing stage equipment? Just like the Nag u posted on the previous thread, again, why would the army need it? Singapore has a close relationship with Israel and Singapore is claimed to be a collaborator in the production of SPIKE missile. Thus why would we want a repetition?<br><br>Lastly, I understand how u feel has a Indian national. Like China, India is a growing economical and military power of the region. With the new founded economical success and growing middle class, many citizens of both countries have the " we reached the moon" mentality. I have personally visited Bharat webby and it is just like those typical patroitic websites of China military forums. They are filled with articles without credible sources and many self-acclaimed military experts writings which ae just fictions. For example, I have seen on China websites saying that their J-6 can shoot down the F-22, or things like "China rocket scientist claims the Tomahawk missile is a joke" All this shows the lack of maturity and fair-mindedness of the forummers.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>It is no wonder India military industry and project development is always delay and hamper due to the high nationalistic of the project management! Without going into a basic fundenmental,they straight away proceed to a higher lvl which they cannot manage,with people like arjun who possessed nationalistic view. Who cannot think rationally and admit its country shortcoming. Arjun MBT project is a great example which development took 30years until now only 5 r deploy due to the fact,the latest field trial fail. Thinking they must match the best (M1A2) and start design a tank which nvr meet the military requirement(India has no design of tank expereince before)? India is not facing any M1A2? Instead of evolving from a present design which will prove more materialistic and possible They totally radically design a tank which they nvr need.They r building a tank which eats up lot of fuel which casues logisitc nightmare. Too heavy,which they need to induct a new series of logistic(Which is not part of the plan). They wanted to obtain the best technology which they themselves cannot produce and start a flurry of purchasing foreign component which cause massive intergration problem. Resulting it failing the latest field trial.<br><br>Same as their LCA,they r too ambition of the engine! Instead of developing a smiliar engine to RD-33 turbofan engine(they have no experience even designiing a turbojet engine). They try to develop a Kaveri which expectation prove too difficult for India to handles.<br><br>If India management continue to have people like Arjun who refuse to accept its country shortcoming,who refuse to take fundenmental step to achieve world-class standard,who disregard facts and statsistic due to national pride and nationalistic! India will nvr progress. Horrible Military project like Arjun and LCA will continue into MCA or next big elepant! Mistakes will repeat and repeat... The next big white elephant I think I'm going to see is the new indigenous aircraft carrier ,India going to build. They nvr build up their ship building capacity and talking abt building a carrier? I seriously doubt it wil materialise. I shall wait and see... Even it did touch the water,I bet it will be 10 times worst than French Charles De gulle carrier which encounter so many problems cos the French refuses to take the fundenmental step too...</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Erm, i believe every industry project would have its fair share of flaws.  But I also believe that as the country continues to develope and produces indigenous equipment, weapons etc, it will also grow and learn from its previous mistakes and flaws.  And hopefully, future products will get better.<br><br>Lets chill off on the Arjun MBT and LCA.  They are good attempts, tho still flawed in one way or another.
