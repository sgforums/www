              <p><a href="http://topics.bloomberg.com/pakistan/">Pakistan</a> cut supply lines to NATO
              troops in Afghanistan and ordered a U.S. withdrawal from a drone
              base after reports that helicopters of the U.S.-led <a title="Open Web Site" rel="external" href="http://www.nato.int/cps/en/natolive/index.htm">NATO</a> force
              in Afghanistan killed at least 24 Pakistani soldiers in an
              attack on a border post.</p>
              <p>Prime Minister <a href="http://topics.bloomberg.com/yousuf-raza-gilani/">Yousuf Raza Gilani</a> “strongly condemned”
              the attack and ordered the Foreign Ministry to address the
              incident “in the strongest terms” with the North Atlantic
              Treaty Organization and the U.S., his spokesman said yesterday
              in an e-mailed statement. The Cabinet’s defense committee held
              an emergency meeting and ordered the U.S. to withdraw from the
              Shamsi Airbase within 15 days.</p>
              <p>Army Chief of Staff Ashfaq Kayani said the attack was a
              “blatant and unacceptable act,” and demanded urgent action
              against those responsible. NATO and the U.S. said the incident
              is being investigated.</p>
              <p>The U.S. and Pakistani governments have been trying to
              stabilize their relationship after a year that included
              Pakistan’s detention of a CIA contract employee for killing two
              Pakistanis, the U.S. raid that that killed <a href="http://topics.bloomberg.com/osama-bin-laden/">Osama bin Laden</a> in
              May, and public accusations by top U.S. officials that
              Pakistan’s army is actively aiding militant groups that the U.S.
              defines as terrorist.</p>
              <p>“This incident puts General Kayani in a very difficult
              position among his troops,” <a href="http://topics.bloomberg.com/talat-masood/">Talat Masood</a>, a retired army
              lieutenant general and security analyst in Islamabad, said in an
              interview. “I don’t think both allies will go to the tipping
              point, but it makes things even worse at a time when the Obama
              administration was trying to restore a working relationship with
              Pakistan after the Osama bin Laden incident.”</p>
              <h2>Border Posts</h2>
              <p>In the Nov. 25 attack, NATO helicopters and a fighter
              aircraft fired at Pakistani border posts on the mountainous
              frontier between <a href="http://topics.bloomberg.com/afghanistan/">Afghanistan</a>’s Kunar province and the Pakistani
              district of Mohmand, according to a statement posted on the
              Pakistani army’s website. The attack is at least the fourth on a
              Pakistan border facility by NATO forces in 15 months.</p>
              <p>Pakistan’s defense committee, in a written statement from
              Islamabad, said the attacks “constituted breach of sovereignty,
              were violative of international law and had gravely dented the
              fundamental basis of Pakistan’s cooperation” with U.S. and NATO
              forces in Afghanistan.</p>
              <h2>‘Shared Interests’</h2>
              <p>“Senior U.S. civilian and military officials have been in
              touch with their Pakistani counterparts from Islamabad, Kabul
              and <a href="http://topics.bloomberg.com/washington/">Washington</a> to express our condolences, our desire to work
              together to determine what took place, and our commitment to the
              U.S.-Pakistan partnership, which advances our shared interests,
              including fighting terrorism in the region,” White House
              National Security Council spokeswoman Caitlin Hayden said in an
              e-mail yesterday.</p>
              <p>NATO oversees the <a href="http://topics.bloomberg.com/international-security-assistance-force/">International Security Assistance Force</a>,
              or ISAF, in Afghanistan. The incident “has my highest personal
              attention and my commitment to thoroughly investigate it to
              determine the facts,” said the ISAF commander, Gen. John R. Allen, in an e-mail. “My most sincere and personal heartfelt
              condolences go out to the families and loved ones of any members
              of Pakistan Security Forces who may have been killed or
              injured.”</p>
              <p>Cameron Munter, the U.S. ambassador to Pakistan, said “the
              <a href="http://topics.bloomberg.com/united-states/">United States</a> will work closely with Pakistan to investigate
              this incident,” according to a statement from his embassy.</p>
              <h2>NATO Investigation</h2>
              <p>It’s “highly likely” that NATO aircraft conducted a raid,
              the British Broadcasting Corp. said, citing an interview with
              spokesman Brigadier-General Carsten Jacobson. NATO is
              investigating how the incident happened and has sent condolences
              for it, Jacobson told the <a href="http://topics.bloomberg.com/bbc/">BBC</a>.</p>
              <p>In September 2010, U.S. forces attacked areas in the border
              districts of Kurram and North Waziristan, killing what Pakistan
              said were several of members of its paramilitary Frontier Corps,
              an army-led force that guards much of the border. Pakistan
              closed its frontier for 10 days to the NATO-contracted trucks
              that haul food, uniforms, construction material and other “non-
              lethal” supplies from its port of Karachi into Afghanistan.
              Pakistan re-opened the border after a joint investigation with
              U.S. officials and a NATO apology for the attacks.</p>
              <p>Afghan and Pakistani Taliban factions regularly attack U.S.
              and other NATO forces from their bases in Pakistan and try to
              slip back across the frontier for protection from NATO
              retaliation. ISAF has at times asserted a right of “hot
              pursuit” of Taliban guerrillas into Pakistani territory, while
              Pakistan has objected, calling such actions a violation of its
              sovereignty.</p>
              <p>The Pakistan-Afghanistan border passes through rugged
              mountains and desert terrain and is unmarked over most of its
              more than 2,600-kilometer (1,600-mile) length. The two countries
              dispute the border’s location in many areas.</p>

For all we know, the border post might have been playing "let's scare NATO aircraft with warning shots" and got shot for their actions. So, wait, gather intel, consider.

              Dalfarce, I'm not too sanguine about China too, they have a tendency to treat large chunks of open sea as their property and can get violent about it.
              
              NATO? Doesn't disturb us, we don't disturb it. China's more likely to disturb us.

              You might be trading one smaller monster for a bigger one. US may attack other countries, but they do not have popular support for it by the people who vote for their leaders, so that functions as a self-limiting check on the military, not to mention that the US already have the "I'm a 600 pound gorilla" mentality pounded out of them in WWII and Vietnam, and economically, so they're less likely to go on little adventures without counting the cost 1st, China still doesn't. As a rising "superpower", they're still feeling for their limits, and the nationalistic pride makes them MORE likely to cause trouble, and unlike the US, their people will be cheering all the way in a war. See the recent Spratley's dispute and the Japanese disputed territories incidents, the Chinese are more prone to using violence on other country's ships, though they were civillian they ATTACKED other people's military. In a war, these people will be goading their government to higher and higher levels of aggression.
              
              Yes, the Americans can be stupid, and that makes them dangerous. The Chinese are nationalistic and feel like others owe them a debt as they are less developed. It makes them even more so. See Germany before the 2nd War.
              
              Prefering China over the US just because "I feel like it" is suicidal and totally does not take into account the mentality of the country. Quit only looking at history and stop fighting the previous war. Look at NOW and what they are likely to do in the future.

              "All the big powers are working to end U.S hegemony"
              
              This part is pretty bullshitty. Russia's quiet, British are allied, French have their own problems, India is worried about Pakistan/Iran. Only one I see on the board is China, and they can't do much as most of their reserves are in US bonds, kick the US and they hurt their own savings.
              
              "For me, U.S is the biggest monster. Their hegemony is dangerous for the world and must be destroyed."
              
              Then you have limited imagination or little referencing skills. China has the potential to be the WWII Germany of this era, and that exercise in German nationalism cost us millions of lives, IIRC 40 million in Russia alone. I repeat. US monster is smaller than China monster. Less soldiers, less rabid.
