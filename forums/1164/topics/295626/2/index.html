            <div class='col-md body'>How about my own story? Laugh at ourselves for a moment....<br><br>I was PS in my NSF. One nite in the Ulu Sembawang area... night movement to contact. Heard firing suddenly to front left , somewhere ahead of the platoon column.<br><br>I knew it was a contact by the  forward section. PC was by chance some 50 metres behind me, moving up after conference with OC.<br><br>I thot I should react to the sound of fire and ran forward to the front to give support to the section commander. Hardly took 4 steps and suddenly I found myself in a  XXXX@@@  pot hole ! Half my body was drenched in wet mud !<br><br>Looking back, I think it was rather funny. At that time I was embarrassed. Luckily the night disguised my embarassment.<br>The garang sergeant fell into a shit hole !!!</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>You people do not know how blur i was in the army. As i grow up studying on my own most of the time, i never listen to my teachers and to any instructions.<br><br>Back when the instructors were teaching us how to strip rifle or anything, i would just drift away and never listen to a single thing. When asked to strip rifle, everyone in my section strip it very fast but i am left with how to even open up the first rifle lol. From then on, i learnt my lesson and start to listen to those sergeants.</div>
