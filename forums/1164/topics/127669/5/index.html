Further we are only getting 20 aircraft I think other allies are getting more so why and how would the americans able to afford us preferential treatment if the other allies didn't get it.<br><br><strong>DOD Approves Lockheed Martin F/A-22 Raptor Aircraft for Full-Rate Production</strong><br><br>(Source: Lockheed Martin; issued Apr. 19, 2005)<br><br>MARIETTA, Ga.--- The Lockheed Martin F/A-22 Raptor fighter aircraft has been given the green light by Department of Defense acquisition officials to enter into full-rate production.<br><br>An acquisition decision information paper released by the Department of Defense on April 18 states "The Under Secretary of Defense (Acquisition, Technology, and Logistics) [Michael W. Wynne] approved the full rate production capability of the F/A-22." This decision officially transitions the Air Force's premier fighter program to a new level of confidence and maturity.<br><br>"This is great news for warfighters whether they are soldiers on the ground or airmen guarding the skies," said Larry Lawson, Lockheed Martin Aeronautics Company executive vice president and general manager of the F/A-22 program.<br><br>"This decision reflects confidence in the performance of the aircraft demonstrated during an exhaustive Independent Operational Test &amp; Evaluation program as well as the team's proven ability to produce the aircraft," Lawson added. "This is the culmination of a tremendous effort put forward by many in the Air Force as well as industry. The Raptor team understands the overwhelming capability the F/A-22 provides is vital today and must also be relevant for three to four decades to come."<br><br>This F/A-22 program milestone follows initial operational test findings in February and March by both the Air Force and the Department of Defense, which judged the aircraft to be "overwhelming effective" in its performance. Air Force pilots will be able to dominate any engagement with the Raptor. The F/A-22 will provide protection for troops no matter where they are, to an extent never before possible.<br><br>The F/A-22 Raptor, the world's most advanced fighter, is built by Lockheed Martin in partnership with Boeing and Pratt &amp; Whitney. Parts and subsystems are provided by approximately 1,000 suppliers in 42 states. F/A-22 production takes place at Lockheed Martin Aeronautics facilities in Palmdale, Calif.; Meridian, Miss.; Marietta, Ga.; and Fort Worth, Texas, as well as at Boeing's plant in Seattle, Wash. Final assembly and initial flight testing of the Raptor occurs at the Marietta plant facilities.<br><br>The Raptor is slated to reach initial operational capability in December 2005 at Langley Air Force Base, Va. The F/A-22's balanced design of stealth, supercruise speed, supportability and super-agility, along with its advanced integrated avionics, will enable combat commanders to change the way future wars are fought.</div>

At the very best, the company could expand its St. Louis work force over the next decade, company executives said Thursday. The four nations combined are considering purchases of at least 231 planes.<br><br>Of course, there are no guarantees. In recent years, Boeing has lost competitions to sell aircraft to Israel and Greece.<br><br>Still, building fighter jets is at the heart of Boeing's St. Louis-area operations, which generated $1.2 billion in annual payroll and paid out nearly $851 million to 1,257 Missouri suppliers and vendors in 2004.<br><br>Meanwhile, the Navy is considering a third, multi-year agreement to buy Super Hornets. The current deal, which runs through 2009, is valued at $8.6 billion, plus another $1 billion for a radar-jamming version of the plane.<br><br>Capt. Donald Gaddis, the U.S. Navy's program manager for the Super Hornet, said if development of the Joint Strike Fighter is delayed, the Navy would have a "serious production discussion" for more Super Hornets to bridge the gap until the Joint Strike Fighter's arrival.<br><br>Combat-ready Super Hornets cost $55 million apiece, Gaddis said. The current multi-year procurement program is on budget and three months ahead of schedule. That means a lot to the Pentagon, which may need to scrap some big-ticket weapons programs to pay for the war in Iraq.<br><br>Gaddis made his remarks Thursday in St. Louis before Boeing unveiled the most advanced version of the Super Hornet, which is packed with a radar and computing system that, in a matter of seconds, will allow the plane to relay coordinates for an enemy target to other fighters, bombers and ships.<br><br>That capability could be used in combat as early as 2007. The radar, made by Raytheon Co., offers three times the detection range and five times the resolution of its predecessor.<br><br>Today, pilots use a lot of time-consuming chatter to direct an attack on a target that's uncovered during a combat mission. The latest Super Hornet is designed to be plugged into a communications network that allows the plane and crew to interact instantaneously with soldiers, ships, satellites and battlefield commanders.<br><br>Gaddis told the Post-Dispatch his deputy is currently in India gathering information from the government that wants to buy at least 126 multi-role combat planes. Boeing plans to enter the Super Hornet in the India competition, which will include Lockheed Martin Corp.'s F-16 and entries from Europe and Russia.<br><br>The Bush administration opened the door to combat aircraft sales to India after agreeing to sell F-16s to neighboring Pakistan.<br><br>"We will be in that (India) competition," said Jim Albaugh, chief executive of Boeing Integrated Defense Systems.<br><br><strong>Albaugh also recently learned the F-15 is a co-finalist for Singapore's next combat plane. Now in the final months of that competition, Boeing faces off against the Rafale fighter made by Dassault Aviation SA of France in what Albaugh described as a "cost shoot-out."<br><br>He plans to travel to Singapore in June to help close the deal.<br><br>"We have to make a profit, but I'm not so sure the French do," Albaugh said. </strong><br><br>Meanwhile, the war in Iraq is putting extraordinary stress on Navy combat aircraft. Some models of the F-18 Hornet, the Super Hornet's predecessor, have flown more than 8,000 hours.<br><br>That's far above their design limit of 6,000 flight hours, Gaddis said. Some planes are even logging 100 hours of flight time a month.<br><br>In response, the Navy has plans to try to double the lifespan of the Hornet's design limit.<br><br>"But that's a pretty tall order," Gaddis conceded.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hi guys,<br><br>Im not sure if you are aware of this.<br>A few years ago, Rafale and the F15K were in a South korean fighter plane competition. In the End the F15K won the deal.<br><br>Im not supporting the F 15k, i prefer the rafale actually. But it seems to scary that history will repeat itself for singapore.<br><br>However, i believe that singapore will wish to diversify our airforce planes. Its not good to have one sole supplier, especially if one day singapore loss our significance on US foreign policy gameplan.  In any case the France will sell to anyone who she is not at war with and if you can pay cash.<br><br></div>

It is perhaps partly for this reason that the aviation industry is paying close attention to the Singapore competition, seeing it as more objective.<br><br>In any case, my take on the matter is that both the F-15 and the Rafale are capable aircraft. We can speculate all we want, but it's anybody's guess which aircraft will be chosen until the announcement is made.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>It is highly likely that Singapore will eventually have the Eurofighter. Our F 5s are bound to be replaced in about 2010.  I doubt that we can get F22, as US have expressed that the F22 is more or less strictly US allowed only.  The JSF will be a damn long wait. Thats when the Eurofighter will come into the picture. The plane will be more or less proven to a certain extent, which designs like Rafale, F15 or Gripen would be significantly older. I guess it is inevitable that we get them</div>
