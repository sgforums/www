            <div class='col-md body'>may provide a clearer picture here.<br><br>Singapore close to finalising fighter decision<br>Robert Karniol JDW Asia-Pacific Editor<br>Bangkok<br>Additional reporting J A C Lewis JDW Correspondent<br>Paris<br>and Michael Sirak JDW Staff Reporter<br>Washington, DC<br>Singapore is set "within the next few months" to finalise its decision on<br>the Next Fighter Replacement Programme (NFRP) to replace the A-4SU Skyhawk<br>attack aircraft, according to sources familiar with the selection process.<br>The contract is expected to involve 20 platforms valued at about $1 billion.<br><br>There has been no delay, but, as is usual with the Singaporeans, they will<br>not be rushed, the sources told JDW. They are being very thorough in their<br>technical evaluations, the sources added.<br>The Republic of Singapore Air Force (RSAF) has shortlisted three aircraft:<br>the US Boeing F-15T; the French Dassault Rafale; and the four-nation<br>Eurofighter Typhoon (manufactured by a consortium comprising EADS, BAE<br>Systems and Alenia). Boeing's F/A-18E/F Super Hornet, Lockheed Martin's F-16<br>Block 60 and Sukhoi's Su-30MK were eliminated from the running on 10 October<br>2003.<br>"The minimum number we'd like to have is eight, but we're looking for 20<br>aircraft. We've asked the suppliers to provide several options," RSAF chief<br>Major General Lim Kim Choon told JDW in2004. However, he acknowledged that<br>second-phase procurement could eventually follow.<br>"We're replacing the Skyhawks but the [Northrop] F-5s are coming online for<br>replacement in terms of available airframe hours by about 2015. Together,<br>we're looking at a [combined] upper-limit requirement of 60-80 aircraft,"<br>Maj Gen Lim explained, adding that around 2008 the RSAF would need to<br>consider additional NFRP aircraft or the US-made Joint Strike Fighter now in<br>development.<br>Singaporean Ministry of Defence sources previously said the final platform<br>selection would probably be made in late 2004 or early 2005, but "the exact<br>timing will depend on the evaluation process". This schedule showed a marked<br>slow-down from initial proposals, which sought a contract announcement in<br>late 2003 and first aircraft deliveries during 2006-07.<br>Under the current process, initial deliveries are expected in 2008-09.<br>A Dassault Aviation aide said: "For some time now we've been working on the<br>principle that the decision will be announced this summer."<br>The official also conceded that Rafale now found itself at a disadvantage in<br>the competition relative to the F-15 because of a factor beyond its control:<br>the rise of the Euro against the US dollar.<br>"Evidently we feel handicapped because the F-15 has a 30 per cent<br>competitive edge due to a currency swing," said the aide. "Our costs and<br>sales price are calculated in Euros."<br>Another industry figure, who asked not to be named, felt both European<br>contestants in the competition - Rafale and Typhoon - were likely to be<br>knocked out of the competition by dollar weakness regardless of their<br>merits.<br>"If the Euro were still worth $0.85, as it was in 2002, Rafale would be a<br>shoo-in for the contract," he said. "With the European currency now at<br>$1.32, the prospects are an awful lot slimmer."<br>Defeat because of currency considerations would be particularly galling to<br>Dassault because it believes the Singapore Air Force favours it for the<br>deal. It would also mean a further setback for Rafale, which has yet to find<br>a foreign buyer.<br>Eurofighter officials declined to comment further on Typhoon's prospects or<br>the extent of the currency exchange handicap.<br>Skip Bennett, head of F-15 business development at Boeing, told JDW on 17<br>February: "We still expect some kind of decision or announcement [on the<br>Singaporean contest] later this spring [or in] early summer ... Right now we<br>are still working to finalise configurations. There are a lot of options."<br>Although Boeing is not currently producing any F-15s for the US Air Force<br>(USAF) (the last two USAF F-15Es were delivered in December 2004, and<br>although Congress did provide long-lead-time funding in FY05 for two<br>additional F-15Es, work on them has not started), 40 F-15Ks for South Korea<br>will be delivered and produced between now and 2008. This, at least, gives a<br>window of opportunity for a smooth continuation of the F-15 line should<br>Boeing win the Singaporean contest or the South Koreans decide to make a<br>follow-on F-15 order.</div>

The consortium had flown out two jets last June to try to win the order.<br>The Typhoon project has been sharply criticised by MPs because of cost and time overruns and by others as an unnecessary relic of the cold war. There are serious doubts whether the full order for 636 planes for Britain, Germany, Italy and Spain will be met.<br><br>The UK is taking 55 of the first tranche of 148 jets to be delivered and has agreed to take a further 89 under the contract, signed by ministers last December, for 236 in the second tranche. The third tranche, with Britain taking 88 of the last 236, may never happen. It is also understood that the Eurofighter consortium has increased worries that the Greek government will never fulfil an initial contract for 60 Typhoons, with the option to buy a further 30, because of the country's budgetary crisis.<br><br>Last year Greece staged the costly Olympics and revised its borrowing figures for the previous three years, running up a deficit of 6% of its GDP.<br><br>The Singaporean decision, which could be appealed against, is a fresh blow to the European industry following the recent success of Boeing in winning orders for its new 787 Dreamliner civilian jet and the failure so far of Airbus to meet its target of 50 orders for its rival A350 by the end of June.<br></div>

But it has raised detailed questions about the ability to fit Singapore's advanced weapons on the jet, a stumbling block that may make it impossible for Eurofighter to win.<br><br>Just over a year ago Eurofighter was selected by Singapore from a group of six aircraft to compete for the order. Three jets, including one made by Lockheed-Martin, were dropped at the time. The other two aircraft that remain in the competition are the F-15 Eagle, built by Boeing of the US, and Rafale, made by France's Dassault Aviation.<br><br>A winner is expected to be selected this summer, and the new Eurofighter concerns make the F-15 and Rafale the favourites.<br><br>Although the potential order is relatively small - eight jets with an option to buy 12 more - Singapore is considered a "reference customer" that is closely watched by other nations since it has a transparent and rigorous acquisition process. A win by Eurofighter would have been a big boost for the programme, which has yet to secure a customer outside Europe.<br><br>"This would have been a real breakthrough order," said Richard Aboulafia, an aerospace consultant with the Washington-based Teal Group. "Even though the numbers are small, it would have been a powerful endorsement."<br><br>BAE Systems, one of three prime contractors building the jet and the company responsible for marketing Eurofighter to Singapore, has pushed hard to win in the city state, and the Royal Air Force has helped, flying two RAF Eurofighters to Singapore last year.<br><br>Industry experts said the recent efforts were believed to have significantly improved Eurofighter's chances, which originally were seen as slim thanks to an equally-strong push by Boeing and the US air force.<br><br>BAE declined to comment on its discussions with Singapore, and a Singaporean defence official said her government was not speaking publicly about the status of the competition.<br><br>Other industry officials said they believed the setback meant Eurofighter had been dropped from the competition, but people briefed on the talks said negotiations between Eurofighter and Singapore were continuing in an attempt to resolve the problems.<br><br>The setback in Singapore comes after the Greek government last year backed away from a commitment to buy 60 Eurofighters, making 18 jets ordered by Austria the programme's only sales outside its four home countries: Britain, Germany, Spain and Italy.<br><br>Such export orders are key to Eurofighter hopes of making the programme profitable.<br></div>
