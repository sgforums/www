NO.<br><br>I think that would constitute aggression.And i'll be very sure which direction my rounds will fly.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>anyway, the flanker family have an extremely short range as compared to a fighter like an f 15. To actually attack all the way here they will be on the edge of their combat radius. We still have to add in the combat fatique factor in too. So unless they have an aircraft carrier operational, we really have nothing to worry about for the time being.</div>

We cannot not help and we will not gain, but we have a lot to lose, during and after the war.<br><br>The scenario is getting ridiculous from a military point of view. The typical combat radius of the Chinese Su 27 Flanker is 1500 miles and that is the distance between Hainan island and singapore! Besides, to fly to malacca straits the planes need to fly over malaysia, or thailand and myanmar. I never see that as an option in any discussion among the chinese military websites and wonder how on earth singaporeans can consider that a possible threat, to justify the purchase of the toys they like?<br><br>Straits of Malacca will continue to be open to all and the only country who can force a blockage is USA, with the approval of Indonesia and Malaysia, and that is not likely to happen.
