            <div class='col-md body'>"Not long had the exercises finished when the media in both countries painted the exercises as a 'rude shock' for the USAF and the Washington establishment. According to respected media reports, Indian pilots outflew the Americans, right through the exercise. Â“On the first day all four American planes were shot down. Never once did the Indians come off secondÂ”. According to United States media, the F-15C's were defeated more than 90 percent of the time in direct combat exercises against the IAF. It should be noted that the IAF did not field its newest Â“near fifth-generationÂ” Sukhoi-30MKI air-dominance fighters and if it did so, the results may have been even more favourable to the IAF. Nevertheless the IAF had the benefit of operating the two-seater Sukhoi-30MK/K Â“four plus-plus-generationÂ” fighters."<br><br><a href="http://users.senet.com.au/~wingman/cope.html" rel="nofollow">http://users.senet.com.au/~wingman/cope.html</a><br><br>"The whole world knows that if you mess with U.S. Air Force pilots, you're going down.

According to respected media reports, Indian pilots outflew the Americans, right through the exercise. Â“On the first day all four American planes were shot down. Never once did the Indians come off secondÂ”. According to United States media, the F-15C's were defeated more than 90 percent of the time in direct combat exercises against the IAF. It should be noted that the IAF did not field its newest Â“near fifth-generationÂ” Sukhoi-30MKI air-dominance fighters and if it did so, the results may have been even more favourable to the IAF.
