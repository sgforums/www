Its already very difficult to get moveable Shermans. How could they stage those battle at Al Quettar? So they turn to the Spanish army and use their Patton tanks. By the way. the advisor of this film is Bradley. He hates and despises Patton. So some facts of Patton were omitted and Bradley glorified his own character in the movie. Those people who wanted to know more about Patton should read "War As I Knew It by General Patton" and  "A Genius For War by Carlo D'Este". The first one is his war diary.</div>

In the movie battle of the bulge, they were using M47s as Royal Tigers.Man, wish they cold get one of those tigers from those tank museums. From what i see, the Americans were using super shermans and M24s. Not the M4A1 , M4A2.<br></div>

The show with one of the most ancient tanks is "A Bridge Too Far". But they are mostly used on roads and they aren't tanks (mostly) but Volkwagen with plastic Sherman chassis.
