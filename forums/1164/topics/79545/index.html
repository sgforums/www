Looking Glass guaranteed that U.S. strategic forces would act only in the precise manner dictated by the President. .........<br><br>.......The airborne launch control officer was the missile launch team leader and, along with the communications officer, operated the airborne launch control system. This system allowed Looking Glass to transmit launch codes to the intercontinental ballistic missiles in their underground silos should ground launch control centers become disabled.

The same year that EC-135s took on the Looking Glass mission, modified Marine Corps KC-130s (re-designated EC-130Qs) took on the mission of command and control of SSBN forces. The EC-130Qs were equipped with a very low-frequency radio transmitters contained in vans loaded aboard the aircraft.. Despite force modernization and advances, both airframes displayed a high degree of reliability and remained essentially unchanged for decades..."<br><br>Hence, they seem to have a backup for the normal C&amp;C networks and would use that should the usual network be disabled...As for the term "retaliatory force", well, the US likes to think of them as a "deterence force" though, using the "you wack me, I'll make sure I'll wack you back hard hard" mentality. Thank goddess none of these weapons have ever been knwon to be involved in an exchange.1962 was a close one...</div>

Its highly-trained crew and staff ensured there wass[was] always an aircraft ready to direct bombers and missiles from the air should ground-based command centers become inoperable. Looking Glass guaranteed that U.S. strategic forces would act only in the precise manner dictated by the President. .........<br><br>.......The airborne launch control officer was the missile launch team leader and, along with the communications officer, operated the airborne launch control system. This system allowed Looking Glass to transmit launch codes to the intercontinental ballistic missiles in their underground silos should ground launch control centers become disabled. It qualified the aircraft as a weapon system even though Looking Glass itself cannot fire a bullet or drop a bomb."<br><br>and another <a href="http://www.fas.org/nuke/guide/usa/c3i/n19980922_981443.html" rel="nofollow">FAS</a> site states<br><br>"Like the Air Force, the Navy also developed a method for maintaining constant control of their nuclear forces. The same year that EC-135s took on the Looking Glass mission, modified Marine Corps KC-130s (re-designated EC-130Qs) took on the mission of command and control of SSBN forces. The EC-130Qs were equipped with a very low-frequency radio transmitters contained in vans loaded aboard the aircraft.. Despite force modernization and advances, both airframes displayed a high degree of reliability and remained essentially unchanged for decades..."<br><br>Hence, they seem to have a backup for the normal C&amp;C networks and would use that should the usual network be disabled...As for the term "retaliatory force", well, the US likes to think of them as a "deterence force" though, using the "you wack me, I'll make sure I'll wack you back hard hard" mentality. Thank goddess none of these weapons have ever been knwon to be involved in an exchange.1962 was a close one...[/b]</blockquote>oh..interesting..<br><br>but did they say what happens in any case when the looking glass thingy gets shot down (anything can happen), and there is no C&amp;C facilities left to authorise a retaliatory nuclear onslaught?</div>
