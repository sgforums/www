            <div class='col-md body'>Clarencebk,<br><br>the Sikorsky S-70 is the manufacturer designation for the helicopter. The US Armed Forces use the S-70 family in various guises including the UH-60, HH-60, MH-60, SH-60. They are used by the US Army, Air Force, Navy and Coast Guard and have names ending with 'Hawk' (eg BlackHawk, Pave Hawk, Seahawk)<br><br>The pic used is technically a S-70, but its one of the HH/MH-60 versions.
