            <div class='col-md body'>Use of GSM was openly discussed at many exercise debriefs during reservist. The conclusion by various people, senior and junior , and from reservists who are telecomms civilian experts .....  GSM can only be relied on during limited war scenarios, but in an "all-out" war, you can bet that the network will be shut-down or  targeted by eaves-dropping devices.  So the network is not secure and robust (which is the terminology used).<br><br>From an old bird RSM, he made a good point during a debrief.... he mentioned that stray signals and faulty GSM phones may be a safety hazard.  In the Army we have electric detonators and POL dumps....</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Yeah... actually the GSM discussion during reservist also extended to commercial GPS use.   Conclusion, the satellites were mostly controlled by the US. And it is a stated fact by the US government that they will downgrade the signal strength or limit the signal so that it can only be received by allied forces.  Hence, don't count on GPS (commercial or military) to be working.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Key to Comms is security and reliability...having been both a comms spec and worked with Comms related companies in the private sector, I can tell you that in war, you or your commanders can't depend on GSM (for reasons stated) or Satellite comms. Iridium, one of the first and last satellite comms provider died...they burnt up all their LEO satellites when they went bankrupt. The rest of the sat comms are controlled by private companies that reroute your calls...hence no security even if there is reliability. If you think you can depend on those, well, I just have to say your wrong...remember what the Israeli did to those PLO people ...they followed their GSM phone trails and took them out. In short, no security.<br><br>Therefore, *if* there is war, all the comms have to be controlled, deployed and within the power of the commanders.<br><br>Having said that, i know for a fact that at div levels, comms are always thru down to brigade levels...from Bde levels to actuall Bn and Coy levels, it really is up to how the Sig Officer's planning in those levels. As state by some, there are environmental factors to be taken into considerations i.e. trees, bodies of water...typical scientific stuff ie. absorption of signals, signal strength and there are standard ways to handle that i.e. rebro, etc. ANd as some stated, comms check, equipment checks are SOP to be followed. If you don't follow those and never plan, then it is as good as not doing your drills for section, platoon, coy level movements...you fail. I understand, having been attached to bde and bn levels, the focus is always on the obvious tasks etc...secure this secure that...but they don't pay attention to the signals or comms plans ... unti l it f**up...then start complaining..so whose fault is it? Of course the commanders...since it is their job to ensure all aspects of the plan are done properly.</div>
