The report of US troops using GSM to communicate,  is the failure of the troops to follow COMSEC, although it is initative on their end. Not sure when your report is dated, but I am assuming is against the insurgents.<br><br>Old radio sets does not mean they don't work well....juz more troublesome to operate. But they are more rugged. It all depends on the signaller's skill to get the comms....terrain....weather etc....all play a part.<br><br>If still don't work well, is usually faulty equipment, but then.....should have checked before moving out.<br><br>Size of encyption key in our sets?..........I am pretty sure such info is classifed.

Not part of our equipment list.<br><br>For Rifle Coys, the platoon medics stick with their respective PS. The Coy medic sticks with the CSM. They thus rely on the PS/CSM comms sets.<br><br>As for the BCS (medical center) team, they have two signallers from Support Coy attached to them on missions.</div>

Thus you are wrong to say nobody will dare to shut it down.  They will make all attempts to do so.<br><br>SAF do not believe in being a sitting duck in defence.
