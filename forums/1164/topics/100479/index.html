As for pistols with special ammunition is need so that the bullet will not over penetrate and shoot open a hole that cause lost of cabin pressure that can bring down the plane. In fact the proceduer of assualt team tactics is very well known, there is a lot of books on it. The SOP of pilots is also standard.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>1) naturally the marshals must be and will be psychologically screened and tested and 'maintained'.<br><br>2) you do not use FMJ rds in airplane or places with high-P containers. dats why some magazines got red tape, some yellow tape.<br><br>3) the marshal is not really distinct like the yankees one, therefore if got terrorist then element of surprise is on the marshal's side.<br><br>4) regarding detonation of bombs....think of it this way....better to bomb the plane up than crash it into a building, causing more death....the terrorists will more likely want to drive the plane into a building to cause more casualties, not just destroy the plane inflight.</div>
