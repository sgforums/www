There are a lot of very trendy, smart (mostly) young people but most of the older generations of 40 and above are as old-fashioned as you can imagine. The gulf is very big between old and new.<br><br>Most grew up with no private phone lines to individual mobile phones. Most went from no VHS player straight to DVD.
