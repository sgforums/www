            <div class='col-md body'>Just for interests' sake, I was reading about aircraft carrier operators, and seems like China has been dabbling in buying old aircraft carriers for studies (HMAS Melbourne, Minsk, Kiev, and Varyag).<br><br>Ostensibly they are purchased for scrap or to convert into amusement parks, it took 9 years to transform the Melbourne to a pile of scrap metal, not before rumours that Chinese aviators used the flight deck and steam catapults to gain experience at sea.<br><br>It also took a while from purchase to amusement park for the Minsk and Kiev, though they are now what they claim to be.<br><br>The Varyag is still docked at a high securty Navy yard since its purchase a few years ago.<br><br>There's even more rumours that none of the three existing ex-Soviet carriers will see Chinese service - rather, China has three indigenously built aircraft carrier hulls soon to enter service. China has also bought maritime versions of the SU-30, lending further credence to this theory.<br><br>It appears that PLAN is well on its way to becoming a blue water Navy.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I read from a China website(www.sinodefence.com) yesterday,saying that the PLAN will not be having an aircraft carrier any time soon due to technological and budgetary constraints. This is because the emphasis is now on Taiwan and getting a carrier now in their opinion does not help much in the invasion of Taiwan. Their argue that their navy should be concentrating on having better submarines to counter the USN carriers in the event of war with Taiwan. I also read about that the Western intelligence(www.janes.com) have recently discovered a new class of conventional submarines(which they named Yuan class) developed by the Chinese launched in Wuhan Shipyard.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>this brings to mind the debates generated during the inter-war years about huge, chunky battleships able to command a presence and dominate the seas vs sleek and fast commerce raiders able to disrupt commerce and bring an enemy to its knees...<br><br>as we all know, until effective countermeasures were found, german u-boats were infinitely more successful than the surface fleet ever could be...<br><br>not to mention that american subs were wrecking havoc in the pacific as well against japanese merchant shipping...<br><br>so is china aiming for a large, expensive, carrier based fleet to command a presence and project power? or are they going for the faster, sneakier alternative? my guess is a bit of both, but for now, more of the latter...<br><br>if they are projecting for an invasion of taiwan, do they need a carrier? no... they just need to blockade the straits and deal with the american carriers with tactics they have been developing all along...<br><br>whether they will succeed or not is anybody's guess... but a naval blockade against taiwan is a very real threat indeed and i think we all know that if it ever came to a matter of who could last longer, we're not gonna put all our money on taiwan...<br><br>so really... is it all about cruising across the straits, guns blazing, missiles overhead? i don't think so... nobody's that dumb... they'll be nothing left to conquer if it came to that.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Taiwan might be China's nearest problem but it is not its only problem, the other issue that spring to mind are the Spratly Islands. Though China has in the past been involved in other territorial altercations with neighbours, Taiwan and the Spratlys are the more notable ones, and both involve the Navy.<br><br>Taiwan is still within easy land-based aircraft range, the Straits of Taiwan isn't very wide. And there are military bases aplenty dotting the coastlines.<br><br>Taiwan aside, the Spratly Islands are supposed to contain big reserves of crude oil and that would be attractive and justifiable for any sizable country in the region to claim. Seems like every country roughly near the Spratlys, bar Singapore, is posting some kind of claim to it.<br><br>China is pretty far compared to everyone else, I think its closest point would be the Hainan Island, and while it is powerful within a given radius from its land bases, Spratlys is just a little far off for easy access. A naval battle group centred on an aircraft carrier would enable a Chinese force projection into the region, though it is smaller than a US naval battle group, is bigger than anything else the ASEAN countries can offer up. In terms of military posturing without going to war, that'd be menacing enough already. Sabre rattling, if you may. China's sabre will rattle the loudest.<br><br>Sure, when the missiles and bombs start to fly, the US would play its "peacekeeping" role and swing either of its carriers in the Indian Ocean or from the Pacific Ocean into the region, but if they come in just to hammer the PLAN, fine and good. What happens after that? Whose side does the US take? They've just leveled the playing field, they have not solved the problem.<br><br>Someone mentioned that to be effective, three CVBGs are needed, one operational, one working up, and one in refitting, well that can arguably be for a global navy like the US is; for China, the time between the cycles can be shorter, plus its proximity to the area of concern is such that working up isn't going to be that complex a matter given that Chinese ports are close enough.<br><br>I guess, since the Spratlys are too small to contain any runway of a meaningful size, China may view an aircraft carrier as a mobile airbase for this region.<br><br>It would however be ironic, if, at the end of the day, Singapore is appointed to arbitrate the proceedings of pumping the Spratly oilfields, given it is the most neutral party in this region on the matter!</div>

China probably need their navy to project forces in the south china sea, and at the most to the indian ocean to protect its sea lanes for crude oil imports. Use of airfields from Burma, Thailand, Vietnam will stretch the range of their planes by a long distance. There is really no need for china to use carriers.<br></div>
