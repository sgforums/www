            <div class='col-md body'>maybe not, due to the fact that at java sea, the largest ship japenese sent out was only heavy cruiser and no battleship nor carriers. A more powerful force of battleship and battlecruiser could eaily win against the IJN and also given the fact the the japan's navy is too preoccupied, maybe not much ships could be sent to java sea.<br><br>however, i'm not too sure whether battle of java sea the japanese ships had air cover or not...but likely with prince of wales and repulse, the allies may win and java may not fall to the japs, then british may be able to retake singapore sooner before 1945.</div>
