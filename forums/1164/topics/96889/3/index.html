Russian failure to withdraw from Manchuria and Russian penetration into N Korea were countered by Japanese attempts to negotiate a division of the area into spheres of influence. The Russian government, however, was inflexible, and it was willing to risk an armed conflict in the belief that Japan was bound to be defeated and that a Russian victory would head off the growing threat of internal revolution in Russia. Japan broke off negotiations and severed (Feb. 6, 1904) diplomatic relations with Russia. Two days later, without a declaration of war, Japan attacked Port Arthur and bottled up the Russian fleet. A series of quick Japanese victories, which astounded the world, culminated in the fall of Port Arthur (Jan., 1905), the victory of troops under General Oyama at Shenyang (Feb.Â–Mar., 1905), and the destruction of the Russian fleet under Rozhdestvenski at Tsushima by Admiral Togo's fleet (May, 1905). Through the mediation of U.S. President Theodore Roosevelt, peace was made in September at Portsmouth, N.H. (see Portsmouth, Treaty of). The disastrous outcome of the war for Russia was one of the immediate causes of the Russian Revolution of 1905. Japan gained the position of a world power, becoming the first non-European and non-American imperialist modern state."<br><br></div>

Pearl Harbor disabled a large chunk of the Pacific fleet less the USS <span style="font-style: italic;">Langley</span> was reduced to delivering P-40s to reinforce the island of Java against Japanese invasion - it was lost here. CV-2 <span style="font-style: italic;">Lexington</span> was lost in the battle of Coral Sea, where the two fleets battled to a draw, where the US lost a fleet carrier but prevented the Japanese from reaching their objectives.<br><br>With the hindsight of history we know that this was the turning point, for the next battle at Midway was the beginning of the end for the Japanese. Still the US lost the <span style="font-style: italic;">Yorktown</span> at Midway, the USS <span style="font-style: italic;">Wasp</span> to a submarine in September. and the <span style="font-style: italic;">Hornet</span> at Santa Cruz. The sinking of the USS <span style="font-style: italic;">Enterprise</span> was the ONLY operating US carrier in the Pacific, from late October to early December 1942.<br><br>So despite the Japanese losing carriers at Midway, it was far from a foregone conclusion.<br><br>As far as the Royal Navy was concerned, after the disastrous Force Z (Prince of Wales and Repulse) defeat, remnants of that fleet escaped to Java, combined with a cobbled-together force comprising of Dutch, British, Australian and Australian ships, known as ABDA. No carriers and hardly enough stuff to prevent Japanese landings on Java and in Bali. The Japanese went as far as to bomb Darwin though no landings were made on the Australian continent.<br><br>The Japanese also took their carriers toward India, flying raids on Ceylon, intercepting merchant shipping, and sinking the British HMS <span style="font-style: italic;">Hermes</span> in the process. Shortly thereafter Japan's efforts turned back to the Solomons and trying to invade Guadalcanal and Papua New Guinea.</div>

Homes and business buildings were set on fire, stores looted, and many women, aged ten through sixties, were raped. Some of them were gang raped right in front of cheering crowds. Some suffered further bodily harm in their private parts as a result of struggling against them, some were tossed into fires and left to die.<br>During that horrible 48-hour period, the Indonesian authorities did little to protect the Chinese or to control the mobs. Adding to the insults of those terrible tragedies, some government officials and community leaders even blamed the Chinese themselves. It makes one wonder if the government instigated the riots.<br><br>In this age, how did the international community every where, who advocate human rights, fail to take notice of these gross human rights violations against the Chinese minority in Indonesia?<br><br>According to a survey made by rescue organizations, there were more than 300 women and girls raped in Jakarta alone, and more than a thousand elsewhere throughout the country during these two days of rampage.<br><br>The Chinese did not dare to protest on the street for fear of a return of the 1967 anti-Chinese riots that caused tens of thousands of deaths and a huge loss of personal property. We Chinese, most of whom have lived in Indonesia for generations, without political power or even voice, have been forced to suffer great human indignity in silence.<br><br>We are counting on the international communities to spread the news of our sufferings, and bring our voices to let other peoples know how the Indonesian government has failed to protect the human rights and properties of its minorities.<br><br>We earnestly hope that you, the citizens of the world, will contact the Indonesian embassies in your countries to protest loudly in our behalf.<br><br>We are in gratitude for whatever you can do to deliver us from this intolerable sufferance.<br><br>-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>Mind you, Indonesia is less then 100km away from our nearest shore..<br><br><strong>6 Years Ago Niah</strong>, Im Glad Singapore got kicked out , or else if ethnic cleansing happens , i dare not imagine ..what will happen..<br><br>The memory is quite fresh..</div>
