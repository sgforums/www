            <div class='col-md body'>In a classic blitzkrieg, Rommel outflanked the British at Gazala, surrounded and reduced the strongpoint at Bir Hakeim and forced the British to quickly retreat, in the so-called "Gazala Gallop", to avoid being completely cut off. Tobruk, isolated and alone, was now all that stood between the Afrika Korps and Egypt. On 21 June 1942, after a swift, coordinated and fierce combined arms assault, the city surrendered along with its 33,000 defenders. Only at the fall of Singapore, earlier that year, had more British and Commonwealth troops been captured. Allied forces were comprehensively beaten. Within weeks they had been pushed back far into Egypt.<br><br>Quotations of Erwin Rommel<br>"Sweat saves blood, blood saves lives, and brains saves both."<br>"Mortal danger is an effective antidote for fixed ideas."<br>"The best form of welfare for the troops is first-rate training."<br>"Don't fight a battle if you don't gain anything by winning."<br>"In a man-to-man fight, the winner is he who has one more round in his magazine."<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Rommel was the kind that believes that the logistics has to catch up with the tactics.  That tactics shouldnt be urealistically limited by one's logistics.  Most conservative warfighting concepts believe that logistics dictates the tactics.<br><br>One of the more famous things he did was convert the Flak-88 into anti armor weapons.  This eventually lead to 88mm guns that sat on the turret of the Tigers and KoenigsTigers.  One of the most fiercesome tanks in the war.<br><br>Rommel was also charged with the defence of Normandy.  It would have been successful if he was allowed to retain his armor to counter-attack the allies on the beaches.   However, Hitler and another guy... Rommel's "mentor,"  did not believe the allies would land on normandy, and did not place the armor where Rommel wanted.<br><br>Had the allies saw the German Armored counter attack on the first wave, they might have called off the assault immediately.<br><br>Rommel is my fav WW2 general too! =)</div>

He continually used weaker forces to inflict greater losses in his desert campaign by regularly employinng pincer movements to encircle escaping columns.<br><br>When faced with superior forces, he abandoned several positions, trading land for time.

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote>Originally posted by Shotgun:<br>[b]Yes, it was more "broad" front rather than amassing forces at critical point for break through right?Still, despite not adhering strictly the blitzkrieg doctrines. However, the "over" emphasis on blitzkrieg lead the allied forces down the wrong track, causing them to come up with under-gunned tank designs like the sherman.</blockquote>Uh no,Guderian still advocates the mass concentration of tanks used upon the weak points of enemy frontline to breakthrough it and harass the rear of the enemy.<br>What differs btw Guderian's concept in the book i mentioned before and blitzkrieg doctrine used by Germans in WW2 is that the latter also does the cutting of the enemy units and encircling them,and eventually the destruction comes,whereas Guderian's concept,it seems to me,is more aligned with "Deep Battle" doctrine by the Soviets.<br>And not to forget that the book by Guderian was written and printed in 1937,2 years before the onset of WW2,thus not surprising if there is any amendment to their doctrine.<br><br><blockquote><br>The allies were so decieved and self deluded by blitzkrieg that they believed that the Shermans didn have to outgun the enemy tanks, since airpower would neutralise enemy tanks.  Their tanks just had to be fast.</blockquote>It seems that this concept is akin to the British's "cruiser tank" concept,as in the infantry tanks which have stronger armour and firepower stick together with the infantry units whilst fighting,and when a weak point of the enemy line had been found the cruiser tanks,which are lightly armour and have weaker firepower but fast, are supposed to break through it and harass the rear.<br><blockquote><br>The entire blitzkrieg thing might have been more disastrous for the allies than the germans.</blockquote>Interesting point,and i know which book you are referring to,but i reserve my opinion.<br>However the author of the book is a Literature professor rather than a history one,and much less of military history.Moreover his points are really controversial and suspected of sensationalism,thus i would take it with a pitch of salt. Nevertheless shall read his book instead of jumping to conclusion.</div>

Army Air Force.<br><br>In anycase, the Americans only adopted "dive" bombers much too late.  Prior to that, the allies also believed the Strategic bombers to be unstoppable.  That en mass, they could defend themselves against attacks.  Of course, we now know it wasn't true, and that the only reason allied bomber losses were reduced was cos of the introduction of the Mustang.<br><br>And the P-51 mustang was not really a late war invention.  The first model of the mustang was already in service in 1941.  The RAF used it as a recon plane, and the US as dive bombers.  It was only much later that they replaced the allison engine with the famous merlin that they realised their solution for long range figther escorts was actually staring at their faces all this while.<br><br>Back to the sherman thing.  Now, why did the British became smart enough to re-arm their shermans with 17 pounders.  Why not the Americans?  Somehow, I feel it had to do with Montgomery's experience in the Desert with Rommel.  He was a cautious commander that didn't really apprieciate the "Blitzkrieg."  Of course, that was why a lot of ppl felt that he wasn't really suitable to be an armored commander.<br><br></div>
