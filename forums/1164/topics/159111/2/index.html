Army Air Force.<br><br>In anycase, the Americans only adopted "dive" bombers much too late.  Prior to that, the allies also believed the Strategic bombers to be unstoppable.  That en mass, they could defend themselves against attacks.  Of course, we now know it wasn't true, and that the only reason allied bomber losses were reduced was cos of the introduction of the Mustang.<br><br>And the P-51 mustang was not really a late war invention.  The first model of the mustang was already in service in 1941.  The RAF used it as a recon plane, and the US as dive bombers.  It was only much later that they replaced the allison engine with the famous merlin that they realised their solution for long range figther escorts was actually staring at their faces all this while.<br><br>Back to the sherman thing.  Now, why did the British became smart enough to re-arm their shermans with 17 pounders.  Why not the Americans?  Somehow, I feel it had to do with Montgomery's experience in the Desert with Rommel.  He was a cautious commander that didn't really apprieciate the "Blitzkrieg."  Of course, that was why a lot of ppl felt that he wasn't really suitable to be an armored commander.<br><br></div></blockquote>I just dont think Monty was good enough to command anything more then a division.

It really didn't make much sense for him to attack Russia other than the fact that he hated the Russians and regarded them as 'subhuman'.

Imagine this: India invaded from the West by the Germans, and from the east by the Japs.<br><br>I know that this is all a lot of fanciful thinking, but I can't help wondering.

[/quote]<br><br>Don't have the source handy but I remember reading that the Germans actually received more resources and raw materials from Russia during 1939-41 (courtesy of their non-aggression pact) than 1941-44, when they controlled large tracts of the Soviet Union!<br><br>That said, even if Hitler didn't hate the Russians and communism as much as he did, I find it hard to believe that two such diametrically opposed totalitarian systems would not have clashed sooner or later, if not in 1941 then perhaps a few years later, when the Soviet Army had completely recovered from Stalin's purges.
