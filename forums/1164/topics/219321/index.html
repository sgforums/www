            <div class='col-md body'>November 8, 2006 (by Lieven Dewitte) - A joint Indo-Singapore air force exercise, codenamed "SINDEX" commenced today at Air Station Kalaikunda in India. This is the third such exercise between the Republic of Singapore Air Force and the Indian Air Force.<br><br>The exercise, which will run until November 30th, hopes to strengthen defence cooperation between the two countries and to allow the air forces to learn from each otherÂ’s operational philosophy and tactics.<br><br>The IAF has fielded its MiG-27 and upgraded MiG-21 Bisons against the Singapore F-16s. The Indian Air Forcee had earlier used frontline jets like the Sukhoi 30, Mirage 2000 and other fighters against F-16s -- the mainstay of Pakistan's fighter fleet -- during earlier exercises with the US Air Force, Thai Air Force and Singapore Air Force.<br><br>The for example United States deployed 12 F-16 CJs from Misawa and Kadena to Kalaikunda Air Base for the Cope India exercise in November last year.<br><br>"The tactics being fine-tuned by the two air forces are dissimilar air combat, air defence and ground support," an IAF spokesman declared.<br><br>Besides the pilots, fighter controllers, air traffic controllers and radar system operators of both the air forces will participate in the exercise. A host of other support staff will also be involved in managing engineering, logistics and administrative issues.<br><br>Air Force Station Kalaikunda in Kharagpur, West Bengal, came into existence during the Second World War as a forward airfield. This base has played a vital role in all the wars fought by India. It has recently been upgraded and at present, it is one of the major IAF air bases for hosting international air exercises.<br><br>The inaugural bilateral exercise between the RSAF and the IAF, SINDEX 04, was held in October 04 at Gwalior Air Force Station. The RSAF participated with six F-16C/Ds supported by 2 tankers and 1 transport plane whereas India operated the Sukhoi-30, MiG-27 and Mirage 2000 aircraft. The second exercise ran from 03 to 20 January in which eight RSAF F-16s participated.<br><br><a href="http://www.f-16.net/news_article2046.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.f-16.net/news_article2046.html</a></div>

Hence the news will be throught the news media who try to get whatever information they can thought the pilots who took part in the exercise.<br><br>I think it did not matter much for the IAF who wins or loses. They are more interested in finding the weakness of F-16's and to find whether the upgraded Mig-21's can take out F-16's, if so in what manner. If it is possible it will agument the strength of the IAF, else they are not losing anything.<br><br><blockquote>The MiG-21s are flying coffins...

Its a name given by the media during the crisis when large number of Migs started to crash. That problem was due to some engine problem and was rectified. This has improved the performance of the plane and no more news of crash are heard.<br><br>Remember that the Mig-21 with the IAF is upgraded and it is now called the Bison.<br></div>

            </div>
            <div class='col-md body'>It was an article I distinctively remembered.  Trainee pilots in an interview, expressed their fear of the MiG-21s notorious reputation.<br><br>As for whether the MiG-21 Bisons are safer or not, I wouldn't know.  However, I don't recall the Bison upgrades to have included modification or change to the powerplants.  However what made the MiG-21s deadly is not just the powerplant itself, but its design.<br><br>Designed as a Mach 2 fighter/interceptor, it has low aspect ratio for an aircraft, suited for high speed flying.  But that also means, that flying at low levels would be trickier and requires more precision.  Thus, if u decide to task the MiG-21 to do CAS, Bison or not, there WILL be accidents.<br><br>On landings especially, landing the MiG-21 would be tricky especially if the aircraft is heavily laden.  If the aircraft is too low, and perhaps a bit heavy, instead of instinctively powering up and pulling up, the MiG-21 pilot has to throttle up, and push forward, reduce AOA then pull up.  Even in the take off, the MiG-21 cannot afford to pitch up too much, or lose the ability to accelerate.  That again, is due to high induced drag, contributed by its very low aspect ratio.<br><br>Of course, taking it out of the CAS role completely, would probably half accident rates.  Putting it back into its High Speed, High Altitude role, which is what the Bison has done, makes it a lot safer to fly.  However, for such an aircraft, don't expect to land it in one piece should some unforeseen failure arise.  A pilot would have better chances ejecting.<br><br>PS: I heard the Ejection seats don't work too well at low speed low altitudes either.<br><br>Comparing against the F-16?  Its state of the art FCS, design, and Zero-zero ejection seat makes it a much safer aircraft to fly and fight.  Not to mention handling a large variety of roles including low-speed, low altitude CAS roles.<br><br>The F-16 in general, especially the modern blocks, is a superior aircraft in all aspects to the Bison.   While its only weakness is its rather short legs.  Which I feel is a problem common to both the Bison and F-16.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Yeah, Bison is the keyword.  Bison upgrades keep the MiG-21s viable in the air to air arena, taking out it away from the ground support role.   Basically, the further it is from the ground, the safer it is to fly, in a way. =D<br><br>So if u ever have a MiG-21 on ur tail, at dogfight range.  Take your fight low, and keep making him rack up his AOA.  He might just crash. =D</div>
