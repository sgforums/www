At least one (or even both) of the Chinese economies will collapse. This will definitely hurt us. We either lose one partner or both.<br><br>2) If war breaks really breaks out, most of the navies in the region will either be directly involved in the conflict or be busy securing their respective nation's own maritime borders. A large stretch of the Pacific Ocean will probably be left unguarded and unpatrolled.
