In both Operation 'Enduring Freedom' and 'Iraqi Freedom', US soldiers raised concerns about the performance of small arms in close-quarter battles; the service's Project Manager Soldier Weapons commissioned the survey to gauge soldiers' confidence in their weapons.<br><br>[first posted to http://jdw.janes.com - 23 July 2007]<br></div>

This pattern has become so set you wonder if this dude is on sgforums for any other purpose except to try to find strange ways to toot our nation's horn.<br><br>In any case it is apparent he makes most of his threads with an appaling lack of knowledge of actual military equipment and procedures.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>If a rifle can fire without stoppage only when<br>it is clean,is it a good rifle?<br><br>US Army shall call for tender to have a fair and open<br>competition to see if there is a better rifle to replace<br>M4.<br><br>Pl prepare one hour to read!!<br><br><strong><a href="http://www.defenseindustrydaily.com/the-usas-m4-carbine-controversy-03289/" rel="nofollow">The USA's M4 Carbine Controversy<br>30-Jul-2007</a></strong>---http://www.defenseindustrydaily.com/the-usas-m4-carbine-controversy-03289/<br><blockquote>.....Gannett's Army Times magazine also obtained a copy of Project Manager Soldier's Weapons Assessment Team's July 31, 2003, report:<br><br>"The executive summary said that M16s and M4s "functioned reliably" in the combat zone as long as "soldiers conducted daily operator maintenance and applied a light coat of lubricant." "<br><br>Soldiers had their own comments, however, which were also included in the report and relayed in the magazine article:<br><br>3rd ID soldier:<span style="text-decoration: underline;"> "I know it fires very well and accurate [when] clean. But sometimes it needs to fire dirty well too."</span><br><br>25th Infantry Division soldier:<span style="text-decoration: underline;"> "The M4 Weapon in the deserts of Iraq and Afghanistan was quick to malfunction when a little sand got in the weapon. Trying to keep it clean, sand free was impossible while on patrols or firefights."</span><br><br>82nd Airborne Division soldier: <span style="text-decoration: underline;">"The M4 is overall an excellent weapon, however the flaw of its sensitivity to dirt and powder residue needs to be corrected. True to fact, cleaning will help. Daily assigned tasks, and nonregular hours in tactical situations do not always warrant the necessary time required for effective cleaning."</span><br><br>75th Ranger Regiment member, SOCOM:<span style="text-decoration: underline;"> "Even with the dust cover closed and magazine in the well, sand gets all inside; on and around the bolt. It still fires, but after a while the sand works its way all through the gun and jams start."</span><br><br>The 507th Maintenance Company, ambushed outside Nasariyah in 2003 during the opening days of the ground invasion of Iraq, might concur with all of the above. The post-incident report released by the US Army had this to say:<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">"Dusty, desert conditions do require vigilance in weapons maintenanceÂ… However, it is imperative to remember that at the time of the attack, the 507th had spent more than two days on the move, with little rest and time to conduct vehicle repair and recovery operations.....</span>''<br><br>Even without those extenuating circumstances, however, there have been problems. A December 2006 survey, conducted on behalf of the Army by CNA Corp., conducted over 2,600 interviews with Soldiers returning from combat duty. The M4 received a number of strong requests from M-16 users, who liked its smaller profile. Among M4 users, however, 19% of said they experienced stoppages in combat Â– and almost 20% of those said they were "unable to engage the target with that weapon during a significant portion of or the entire firefight after performing immediate or remedial action to clear the stoppage."<br><br>The report adds that "Those who attached accessories to their weapon were more likely to experience stoppages, regardless of how the accessories were attached [including via official means like rail mounts]." Since "accessories" can include items like night sights, flashlights, et. al., their use is not expected to go away any time soon.</blockquote><img src="http://www.defenseindustrydaily.com/images/ORD_HK416.jpg"><br><img src="http://www.defenseindustrydaily.com/images/ORD_M4_Carbine_SOPMOD.jpg"><br><br><strong><blockquote>The last word will be left to SOCOM's Major Chaz Bowser:<br><br>"<span style="text-decoration: underline;">We buy new laptop computers every few years across the gamut, so couldn't we do the same with our single most important piece of military equipment? .... Waiting for a leap-ahead technology based on a kinetic energy weapon platform is a waste of time and money, so we need to look at what is out there nowÂ…. What the Army needs is a weapon that is now ready for prime-time and not a developmental systemÂ…. The requirement comes from the field, not from an office in some garrison activity, not from some consultant and definitely not from a vendor.</span><br><br>Let's do this quickly without all the bureaucracy typically associated with change. Find someone in our ranks who can make a decision Â– who hasn't floated a retirement resume with a gun company Â– and make the decision now. Just look how fast we were all issued the 'highly coveted' black beret or the digital uniform. Find that recipe card, change out the word 'Velcro' with 'battle rifle' and that may be a start to finding a solution [DID: which, he acknowledges, could be Colt's M4 if that's what the competition shows]. Our men and women deserve much better than we are giving them, and shame on us."</blockquote></strong></div>
