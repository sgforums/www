            <div class='col-md body'>I question the credibility of certain PRC analysts.  Those of you with cable might have seen the program on Ch 49.  Fat guy decked out in military fatigues who thinks wearing a LBV makes him look gung ho or something.<br><br>Very pro China as expected.

What makes me uncomfortable is that there's quite a bit of footage on Taiwan invasion drills.  Its almost as if they are adamant about invading the island.<br><br>Watched it twice &amp; gave up.  If I wanna watch this kinda show, I want a show that is unbiased.  If I want to be given propaganda on how great the PLA is, I might as well go around with the communist flag shoved up my you know where.</div>
