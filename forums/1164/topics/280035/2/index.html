The so-call defence analyst you are referring too is an academic. His job is to read and write, and if he/she is in the defence field, writes about defence stuff. In order to appear on TV and other media as an academic expert, normally you would need to have quite a bit of academic credential so a PhD would be minimum.<br>Singapore only have one "pure" defence analyst at the moment, his name is Dr Bernard Loo, incidentally my lecturer. There are other analysts, but they are normally experts on other fields such as a certain area like China or they could be experts on International Relationships or civil-military relationship.<br>The RSIS churns out about 150+- students every year and although a good number of them are international students, it is still highly probable that there will be an increase in the numbers of defence analysts.<br>The thesis for MSC in RSIS is 10,000 words. So for those who had experience in writting 12,000 thesis, it shouldn't be much of a problem.<br>Defence-Analyst don't earn a lot more than other academics.....meaning you will survive well, but you are not going to get rich if you are just going to depend on your salary. The exact figures, well depends on which University you are in and how many of them you are in. But most likely to be above 4000, but lower than 5 figures per month.<br><br>Hope that this will give you a better idea. I don't come to sgforum so often now, but if you have questions, I welcome you to PM me and I will respond as quickly as possible.<br>Best wishes for your studies</div>

I'm into this industry but I hardly find out anything about those equipment and I bet a lot of people in Military Nuts probably knows more about them than me. But the thing is, the specific specs of the equipment are not the important things that you need to waste yout brain cells on. Generally Janes provides a good summary of them every year and they are only referred upon when needed. The important things are actually war theories and incidentally they are learnt in the most uninteresting manner - namely, history.<br><br>The concept of war is much harder to grasp than its grammer.</div>
