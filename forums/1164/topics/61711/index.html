            <div class='col-md body'>Rare glimpse of S'pore's naval research given by Defence Ministry, which says homegrown technology is a must<br><br>By David Boey<br><br>SINGAPORE'S new fleet of stealth warships will form the backbone of the 'next generation navy', carrying the latest in weapons and sensors.<br><br>To add firepower to the six 110m warships, which will come into service from 2007, defence planners are looking into arming them with more agile anti-ship missiles that fly faster than the speed of sound.<br><br>The first of the Republic of Singapore Navy's new squadron of frigates is still being constructed in France and the others here.<br><br>Yesterday, Permanent Secretary for Defence Peter Ho lifted the usual veil of secrecy from some of Singapore's ongoing research into new naval technologies.<br><br>The RSN's future would be underpinned by developments in areas to do with stealth, electronic warfare, unmanned systems and guided weapons.<br><br>In his opening speech at the 9th Naval Platform Technology Seminar yesterday, Mr Ho said that the Ministry of Defence would continue investing in certain areas of defence research and development, even though new technologies can be bought from the world's arms market.<br><br>Mr Ho, a government scholarship holder who was trained as a naval officer, spoke to more than 500 navy officers and defence engineers from 30 countries at the seminar.<br><br>While Singapore buys whatever and whenever it can off-the-shelf, he said there was an 'irreducible' minimum that the country had to invest in such research to stay ahead, even if the technologies later become available on the market or obsolete.<br><br>'That is a price we have to pay in order to develop and sustain our defence technology capability,' he said.<br><br>For example, in the 1980s, DSO National Laboratories developed an unguided bomb made into a smart weapon by fitting it with a camera to direct it to its target. This became a 'learning project' for DSO's young engineers and scientists, just out of university.<br><br>'It was not rocket science,' he said, and the outcome was simply a prototype.<br><br>But it gave the engineers and scientists an excellent learning opportunity in design, testing and evaluation.<br><br>Now a project to develop a rocket-powered target drone, which could be used as a 'live' target for guns and missiles, has also reached the prototype stage.<br><br>That project helped engineers build up knowledge in specialised areas of weapons engineering linked to aerodynamics, flight control, navigation and guidance, all crucial to developing unmanned systems.<br><br>Mindef has examined the scope for using a high altitude, long endurance unmanned aircraft as a flying radar station.<br><br>'Investments in time and resources have to be made now to seek innovative responses,' said Mr Ho.<br><br><a href="http://straitstimes.asia1.com.sg/topstories/story/0,4386,219436,00.html?" rel="nofollow">http://straitstimes.asia1.com.sg/topstories/story/0,4386,219436,00.html?</a></div>

The only thing that is unclear from this particular article is that will RSN also purchase Aster 30 and field a mix of Aster 15 and Aster 30 on each ship?<br><br>In the ST version, I wonder if ST Marine is also secretly building or designing a new class of  stealth corvettes for the RSN on top of the Delta frigates. I felt that there were some subtle hints but I don't know if I am being overly "sensitive" or this is indeed the case.<br><br></div>

It should not be impossible to extend a MM-40 Exocet to fly above Mach 1 given it is already doing 0.9 Mach.<br><br>RSN may also explore the possibility of getting one from other source such as the Taiwanese Hsiungfeng-3 missiles, or Indian's Brahmos.</div>

In view of known technology collaboration with our two western allies , it is undoubtable that our future ASM will certainly be from either the French or the American source.<br><br>The French system is relatively flexible as Singapore had gone upfront to sent up long term scientific researches with our french counterparts. The last time i heard about the ANF is that it was shelved due to funds and security problems. Singapore can retrigger that project by injecting funds and researchers into that much needed pool. With so much talks about intimate collaborations with france , i believe we can tailor the ANF to meet our interest as well as their's.<br><br>Some other missile plateforms to consider for our Deltas is the Exocet Bk3 , the Harpoon Bk2 and the Polyphem-S to replace our Gabriel SSM.</div>

It is not unprecendented that the SAF might use Russian equipment.

Not unless u are engaging in the open south china sea , doubt we will have much chance firing one.<br><br>On russian Naval missiles :<br><a href="http://www.wonderland.org.nz/rnss.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.wonderland.org.nz/rnss.htm</a><br></div></blockquote>Logical prognosis.... but I would like to add some thoughts to this...<br><br>1. Exocets MM40 mk3 were unofficially announced as the ASM for the Deltas. The mk3 version is the latest, longest range, and meanest ASM from France. It has a 90KM? range and a speed far higher than Harpoon. &gt; 0.9 Mach.<br><br>2. Supersonic ASM doesn't mean one has to fly at Mach 2. What about one that flies at Mach 1.1 to Mach 1.4?  The whole idea is to ensure that missiles will arrive the target before the sonic boom to alert the enemies. Furthermore, one that flies faster also mean harder for the CWIS or SAMs to intercept, not to mention, "I can whack you before you return your punch" philosophy.<br><br>3. Why is it so difficult to develop and interim ASM? France can certainly push Exocet a little faster, DSTA can assist in development and research. DSTA can secretly learn to assemble and build, say the Taiwanese supersonic ASM. Afterall, it is very much Harpoon like in appearance anyway, wouldn't raise any suspicion.<br><br>4. Why can the Deltas carry a mix of supersonic and subsonic ASMs? Certainly can.<br><br>5. RSN is fast developing a green water, if not blue water navy. Its theatre of operation is non longer just Singapore Straits and the Melacca Straits.  We should expect RSN to operate in the open seas of Indian Ocean and South China Sea.  RSN has the obligation and tasks to protect Singapore's SLOC which is not just the mere 2 straits....<br><br>Just my 2 cents worth.<br><br></div>

By cruising at such speed , u can evade interception and even radar detection(?) , however the main point which i wanna say here is not about evading SAMs or CIWS but about how useful is such missiles in our crowded SLOC and neighbouring waters.<br><br><blockquote>I can whack you before you return your punch" philosophy.</blockquote>Yes , but that is a philosophy of vast water surface. But in our regional content , it will be a ' i score a civilian hit ' fact of life.<br><br><blockquote>4. Why can the Deltas carry a mix of supersonic and subsonic ASMs? Certainly can.</blockquote>Take a look at our Gunboats now. Even with the subsonic Harpoon missiles , our MGB have to be armed with Gabriel SSM for precision engagement in crowed SLOC.<br><br>U will see that the subsonic harpoon aint suitable for some of the engagement in our region and now u wanna intergrate Supersonic missiles?

Look at the western navies who patrol international water more frequent ly than the eastern navy , do they have to adopt supersonic missiles? No.<br><br>Did the arm race during the cold war period make the Americans develope supersonic missiles? No. So the conclusion is , i agree that supersonic missiles are harder to intercept , harder to evade.But we must understand our needs and our wants. We must ask the following questions :<br><br>Do we really need supersonic missiles during our main patrol of the south china sea , the Singapore strait and the Malacca Strait?<br><br>How useful are such missiles?<br><br>Is supersonic missiles a need for power projections as a blue water navy? Why aint developed navies of the world replacing subsonic missiles with supersonic missiles?<br><br>Wat are the problems if we intergrate supersonic missiles , subsonic missiles and wire guided missiles onto our ship? Does that make sense?<br><br>Cheers,<br>My 5 cents.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Lets see this senario in the vast ocean :<br><br>A Delta Class Frigate was at a range of 200km from a destroyer armed with 8 sunburn missiles. The Sunburn missiles have a range of 150km , it can attain a speed of 2.4mach while cruising at wave level. If the sunburn was fired at our delta , it will certianly be high to intercept.<br><br>When our Delta frigate was within range of the sunburn, our ship was still safe because<strong>our stealth delta frigate cant be detected at that range of 150km.</strong> When our Delta Frigate was at 120km from the destroyer , the destroyer was within our Harpoon engagement range and we engage.<br><br>If we will to purchase the Exocet bk3 , we can engage at a range of 180kms , 30kms ahead of the Sunburn. Thus u can see that even without the long range of supersonic missiles , our stealthy Delta Frigate with good countermeasure system is still at the upperhand.<br><br>Second senario in a crowded SLOC :<br><br>Our MGB was patrolling the crowded strait of Malacca. A Destroyer armed with 8 Sunburns. At the range of 200kms , the destroyer detected our MGB and ordered an engagement at 150km. Within range, the sunburn was launched but due to it's supersonic nature , it scored a civilian hit.<br><br>At a range of 120kms , the commander ordered a harpoon engagement to the destroyer but was adviced not to as the destroyer is cruising among international ships , taking them as shields. The MGB streaked 40km from the Destroyer and launched a Garbriel missile , beautifully guiding the missile into the destroyer crippling it and order it's surrender.<br><br>Thus u can see that the use of supersonic missiles in crowded SLOC is almost impossible. With ships crowding the area and with the electronics on board our ships , a score from such missile is close to zero.<br><br>Conclusion , with high end electronic systems and stealthy features. Our ships armed with subsonic missiles aint at the losing end compare to large unstealthy ships with supersonic missiles. We can also concluded that short range wire guided missile is still a vital element in naval engagement in our region.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>To wd1 :<br><br>Dear pal , i disagree generally with u.<br><br>1) I agree that Supersonic missile have way much advantages than subsonic missiles in terms of evading interception and detection. U had said a great deal abt it , however i had already illustrated that such supersonic missiles aint the optimum choice for our Frigate. Basically , it cant engage precise targets in crowded environment of our region and without supersonic missiles , we aint at all at the lower end. So why supersonic missiles for Singapore?<br><br>2) U had stated that our Frigates are for power projections and they need 4 legged missiles. I believe u had missed the importance of wire guilded missile on our the frigates which are suspose to replace our MGBs. If our MGBs had been replaced by the Frigates and if the Frigate aint armed with wire guided missiles , who will do the close range cum very precise engagement?<br><br>3) I stated that supersonic missiles aint an reliable aspect in naval engagement currently. It can be justifiy as we see that the western navies ( in fact most of the world navies ) do not arm their ships with such weapons.  U debated that the reason why Americans aint investing into such system because their unmatchable naval fleet is able to give cover to their ships ( am i right here ? ). However , i wonder do the British navy , the Spanish Navy , the Japanese Navy etc think likewise that their fleet air arm can cover their ships , thus not investing into supersonic missiles?<br><br>4) U had stated that the supersonic is almost unstoppable when it is fired. However i had already stated that our Frigates stealthy design cum advance electronic make us virtually 'not there' at a range of 200 to 300km away. U had not thought on wats the use when our enemy's ships were destroyed b4 they can even detect our ships?<br><br>My illustration ( above )had said that our ships first look capability will certainly give us a first kill capability. Even if our ships were detected early , we still have the capability to shoot first and kill first using NG-subsonic missiles such as the Exocet Bk3 against most of our enemy's ships (armed with most of the general supersonic missiles except afew).</div>

The actual replacement could be in the form of ST Marine OPVs armed with short to medium range SSMs or fitting Gabriels permanently on our PVs.<br></div>

But to write off the Harpoon as expensive and lousy, that's underrating it. I cannot proclaim to be an expert on ASMs, but let me give you a post on another forum by one who is well versed...<br><br>"Don't hold your breath. Statements like that are an absurd<br>over-simplification. The Russian anti-ship missiles represent one set of<br>technical solutions to penetrating anti-missile defenses. They are not<br>the only set of solutions to those requirements nor are they necessarily<br>the best.<br><br>The Russian attention to hypersonics had its costs. The missiles are big<br>and heavy. limiting the number that can be carried. Their high speed<br>causes severe airframe heating that prevents them using infra-red<br>guidance. It also commits them to a straight run-in course (or, at best,<br>gentle curves). They have a heat plume that a thermal sight can detect<br>while the missile is still kilometers over the horizon.<br><br>There are such things as adaptive and iterative guidance systems that can<br>be applied to subsonic missiles that simply cannot be used on the<br>hypersonics. Subsonics have much lower signatures so can be more<br>difficult to spot. They don't guzzle fuel like hypersonics so can deliver<br>equal punch in a much smaller airframe. And so it goes.<br><br>For your information; Russian-style hypersonics are known as "streakers",<br>Western style highly agile subsonics as "dancers". Both have their place<br>but their relative merits are still being evaluated with great passion.<br><br>What is startling is how few of their naval weapons the Russians have<br>actually sold. P-270 Moskit has gone to China and they have sold 96 Kh-35<br>Harpoonski to Algeria. Contrary to your repeated assertions, they have<br>not sold any of their naval weapons to the US. They have sold a small<br>number of M-31 target drones to the US via Boeing on the simple logic<br>that it was cheaper to buy the actual missile in question than to spend<br>money developing a simulator. M-31 is a version of Kh-31, a short-range<br>air-to-surface missile, roughly equivalent to Maverick.<br><br>As a point of factual accuracy, neither the US nor the UK nor any other<br>major western sea power has adopted or has any plans to adopt any Russian<br>designed weapons system.<br><br>As a point of factual accuracy, according to SIPRI, Russia is now the 5th<br>largest arms supplier in the world in terms of value of signed contracts<br>and its relative position is declining.<br><br>I would like to revise my first sentence. please do hold your breath<br>while waiting, you'll find the experience instructive<br><br>Stuart [Slade]<br><br>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br><br>Streakers and dancers complicate intercept in two ways. If we take the<br>intercept window of a crude, basic anti-ship missile (subsonic,<br>straight-in) as a baseline there are two options. The first is to use the<br>Russian approach and get the missile to cross that intercept zone as<br>quickly as posisble. This means adopting the shortest path across it and<br>flying that path as fast as possible. Hence P-270. This is a perfectly<br>viable approach.<br><br>The second is to stretch the time the CIWS needs to destroy the missile<br>to the longest possible point. In effect, this (a) reduces the percentage<br>chance of the system killing the missile and (b)reduces the number of<br>inbound systems a single CIWS can engage. One way of doing this is to use<br>an iterative guidance system in the missile.  This works by giving the<br>missile a fine-cut radar receiver which picks up and localizes the<br>emissions from the CIWS fire control system. The missile knows its own<br>course and speed, it now knows the position of the CIWS (and can work out<br>the course and speed of the target). The computer in the missile knows<br>the algorithms used by the closed loop tracking system in the CIWS to<br>correct the aim of the CIWS. it can therefore work out what the firing<br>correction applied by the CIWS will be and alter the missile's flight<br>path to be somewhere else. This system is a service reality.<br><br>A third method is to physically shrink the envelope. The outer edge of<br>the intercept window is set by the maximum range at which the inbound<br>missile can be spotted, the inner edge is the range at which wreckage<br>from the shot-down missile will still strike the target ship. We can push<br>the outer edge in by flying the missile lower, by making it more<br>difficult to spot and by reducing its emissions. We can pull the inner<br>edge outwards by making sure the shot-down wreckage travels faster.<br><br>Putting all this together means that existing streakers fulfill<br>rerquirement (a) very well at expense of (b). In terms of (c), the<br>significantly pull the inner edge back (from 1 km to around 2.5) but have<br>major sacrifices in the outer edge. Their level of airframe heating,<br>their heat plume, the altitude at which they fly, their active radar<br>emissions, all mean they can be detected well over the horizon.<br><br>On the other hand, dancers make major gains in (b) at cost of performance<br>in (a). They sacrifice the inner edge of the engagement zone but achieve<br>major gains in reducing the outer edge by being inconspicuous. Typically,<br>they come in with their radars off (homing on command or IR), they are<br>coated with RAM (which streakers can't use since it burns off), they have<br>little airfrme heating and only a limited plume.<br><br>In summary, streakers move fast but have a larger, more distant intercept<br>zone. dancers move more slowly and evasively and have a much smaller<br>intercept zone, closer to the target ship. Close your eyes and visualize<br>it, you'll see what I mean.<br><br>This leads to a curious point which comes back to the Soviet's lack of<br>systems analysis. They designed P-270 to exploit certain weaknesses in<br>the SPY-1 radar performance. This it does, but by looking at a single bit<br>of equipment in isolation, they neglected to evaluate the target system<br>as a whole. Had they done so, they'd have found they'd managed to push<br>the intercept envelope back into an area where AEGIS works very, very<br>well.  Once Standard SM-2 had been given an IR auxiliary homing system,<br>it was more than capable of shooting the P-270s out of the sky. Its<br>essential to think system-to-system NOT weapon-to-weapon.<br><br>On average a P-270 weighs about 4.5 times as much as a Harpoon. This<br>loads the odds in favor of Dancers - remember effectiveness is related to<br>squares of numbers.<br><br>Your comments about Yakhonts containers do not represent new technology<br>or anything particularly unusual - most western missiles have been<br>delivered that way since the late 1960s. We treat them as "wooden rounds"<br>- get them, slip them into the rails, hook them up, run a self-diagnostic<br>then adjust people's attitude with them.<br><br>Sadly, I can deny the Russians are achieving a lot of success; I say<br>sadly because I thought they were going to do a lot better than they<br>have. Their equipment has stirred up a lot of interest but relatively<br>little of that has translated into sales. Where it has, it is usually<br>because of a lack of any opposition. Malaya represents the only case<br>where Russian equipment has secured an order in the face of Western<br>competition.<br><br>Stuart "<br><br>The Standard which he was referring to is the SM-2 Block IIIB... I believe that after reading his post, one can conclude that the seemingly much poorer performance Harpoon may not necessarily be that bad when compared to its Soviet counterparts..</div>
