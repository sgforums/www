            <div class='col-md body'>ohhh shit!!! i forgot the frigates are replacing our MGBs. of course we still need those gabriels for accurate pointblank range plinking, they're very impt there still. agree wholeheartedly on that. the MGBs' small size and agility make them great for hiding between big merchant ships and ambushing enemies too.<br><br>i was talking mainly on the open-ocean arena, and admittedly concentrating on harpoon-bashing at that. but i really doubt harpoon can be considered a cutting-edge missile anymore. if as u said our as-good-as-invisible frigates shot first, the harpoon will get shot down easily by his CIWS and the enemy will know he's being hunted and the general direction of our ship.<br><br>u have a point though on how come many other navies all use harpoon. u win here...maybe coz its reliable and proven and commonly used? i dunno...<br><br>basically my pt was that harpoon is getting overtaken by new missiles, and to have an advantage the RSN should buy a new-tech faster missile. i think whats impt is not strictly whether an antiship missile is supersonic or not, but that it is fast and survivable enough to beat a warship's self defense systems and kill it. harpoon is not. if exocet 3 which goes at almost double harpoon's speed (mach0.5 vs 0.9) is good enough lets use it. thats what ure saying rite.<br><br>kinda noe more abt brahmos and sunburn... first time ive heard of exocet 3, so was trying to promote the first two a bit haha. i'll go check exocet 3 out yeah?<br><br></div>

NO. What i said was that SAF is to become an expenditory force.<br><br>There are steps to become an expenditory force , our first step was clearly shown when we annouce to the world our 4 Endurance Class LPD-like LST ( sad to call it so ). Then we show great in undersea warfare interest by collaborating with western countries on that research. Shortly after , we circumnavigate the globe and show off our LST's capability to the world on her journey. Then the world was shock again to know that we are currently building 6 Stealth Frigates. Now this thread was open because RSN wanted stealth warships are the core of her orbat in the future.<br><br>So u see , all i did said was that we are aiming to be an expenditory force , not trying to say that we are an expenditory force now.

But could they by themselves I mean, even the frigates that were to armed to what you stated, there r still very vulnerable w/o air cover. </blockquote>On dealing with surface threats , i believe we currently have the capability to put up a fight with most of the navies in our region ( up to Australia but certainly not India in the Indian Ocean or China near their Naval heartland ). In the future with more advance combatant , we can project our force confidently further from Singapore.<br><br>I agree that we need aircover , with aircover ( which is a bonus ) we can be more confident on our victory. I believe in the future with more and better vessels , we might be independent of that ( who knows ).<br><br></div>

U had said in ur previous post that our ships can onli 'kick' in our region. How much do u wanna include into the word region? Our region can asia , asia-pacific , or ASEAN? If it is Asean that u mean , then i can tell u that our navy can engage in minor stand offs up to western Oceania region which is out of ASEAN.<br><br>I had quoted JDW saying that our SAF will to become a expeditory force. U said that our expeditory force is onli restricted to our region , i can then tell u confidently that we are already an expeditory force to be reckon with under your impression now.<br><br>Gary , u have a habit of putting words into my mouth. I will like ask when did i say an ocean crossing expenditory force? An expenditory force may include many meanings. To some it is the 7th fleet , to others it is jus an increase in combatant, an increase in capability to future enchance victory in regional battles and the capability to move military influence out of her shores. How much further is dependent on how much she wanna invest in. If u need wat Gary said jus to be an expenditory force , then the world will onli have 1 expenditory force and perhaps 5 sub-expenditory force kicking.<br><br>I have full confidence that Singapore will not stop at 6 Frigates and 4 LSTs. Our technology shown off in our LST had amaze the whole on how we can manage to run large ships with small amount of people. I can forsee that for the next 10 years , more Frigates even guilded missile Destroyers can be included into our inventory.<br><br>Our 6 MCV have to go in the next 10 years , 12 PVs will have to face up to retirement perhaps in the next 5 to 10 years if a replacement is convincing enough for the Mindef to adopt. Our beloved Sir Lancelot LST may be replaced by something bigger ( how much bigger we dun know ). Our submarine is facing a undoubtable replacement by 2010. So let us have a summary of RSN 2015 :<br><br>6 Frigates/ Destroyers. 110m+<br>6 Frigates. 110m<br>6 OPVs 81m ( replacing ASWPV ).<br>6 PVs.<br>4 LSTs.<br>1 LPD ( or bigger vessel ).<br>5 NG-Sub.<br>2 Sub ( Sjoormen for training ).<br><br>Our dear RMN is aiming for 27 NGPVs and im sure RSN will be planning something big. I believe with the force ( as above ) , protecting our interest as far as the Indian Ocean ( not a stand off with india ) or senting ships for peacekeeping missions anywhere on this globe wont be a problem. That is wat i call and i believe what JDW will call an expeditory force.</div>
