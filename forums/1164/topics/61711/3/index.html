As i reply to laser, if our enemy have AWACs and therefore could target our ships over horizon and we can't , it certainly dun look good for us especially if the enemy a/c joined into the fight as well.</div></blockquote>Hmm Gary , u pose a good and difficult question that questions the defination on expeditory force.<br><br>I had stated that my defination of a expeditory force is a force that can spread her military influence away from her shores , her region to protect her interest. How much power and how far from her shores is dependent on how much the govt willing to invest in. I had also stated that our 2015 capability of senting a significant amount of ships and power for peacekeeping mission anywhere on the globe is already a form of power projection and force expedition. I believe thats wat JDW mean too.<br><br>I will also like to tell u that not all naval projection is so intense that it require fighter cover for it. I believe a fleet of 6 Frigates and 3 Destroyers can be potent enough to ward off any potiential threat which we can think of any we patrol the seas.<br><br>On the over horizon thing..lol , u must have forgotten that our ship is steathy. A detection from a range of 200 to 300 is doubtful.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote>I think most of us have realised by now that United States Navy's doctrine on sea warfare is somewhat different from most of the smaller Navies.</blockquote>Different? I believe there are differences in doctrine , but i dun see a difference in weapon confriguration in most of the allied navies and the smaller navies which follow their confriguration.<br><br>It is standard to have 8 SSM ( Harpoon/Exocet ) as their arm confriguration for most of the European Navies , the Asian Navies and the North American Navies. Did they not realise that their doctrine are different from that of the USN or there is no need for other confriguration??<br><br><blockquote>The fact that aircraft carriers have longer strike range than any type of Surface to Surface missiles pretty much convinced USN that nothing today can beat having man-plaforms throwing lots of guided munition and standoff weapons at you.</blockquote>Under ur impression , are u trying to say that in the USN , the Harpoon ain the primary naval Weapon?U must know that not ever deployment of the USN involve carriers. So how are u going to argue that their combatant dun rely on the Harpoon as their primary naval spear?<br><br><blockquote>One can argue that it is far easier to down an ASM than a guided standoff munition like Popeye or JDAM.</blockquote>JDAM? It is a unpowered bomb ( i dun think it is a stand off weapon ) and i believe it is far easy to shoot down a JDAM then a ASM. There had been reports that Sea wolf SAM can shoot down artillery shells.<br><br><blockquote>Thus, upgrading of Harpoon become less of an incentive. Upgrading to Block 2B Harpoon also may not be viewed as cost-effective.</blockquote>The Harpoon Bk2 is answer to navies who cant afford seaborne cruisemissiles. Therefor i see the Harpoon Bk2 a very good industrial strategy which allow Boeing to secure more deals in the market of Navies not using the Harpoon before and the market of Navies who uses the Harpoon Bk1.<br><br><blockquote>However, to Navies that have no carrier battle groups or even a Helicopter carrier, having long range ASMs become viable solution, especially one that can perform land attack as well.</blockquote>I dun see most of the world doing that. Their answer to a lack of air support is to use stealth as a mean to avoid detection and therefore increase their lethal capability. U must know that if the enemy cant detect u , how long ranged her ASM be , they can engage u.</div>

AFAIK harpoon was a purpose-designed ship-to-ship missile first, only then adapted for air launch. the designers could well have had air launch in mind, but harpoon was primarily meant for ship use.<br><br>and neither is it short ranged by any means. perhaps only when u compare it wif sunburn or tomahawk...<br><br>as for the tomahawks, it was only practical to use if u had a good idea of where the enemy ship would be after the missile had travelled a few hundred miles at subsonic speed. which works out to at least half an hour... more than enuf time for the enemy to make a lucky turn out of the missile's seeker range.<br><br>foxtrout8... sorry to cut in, but if u were any sensible admiral would u have ur big warships running arnd without ASMs even if u had powerful carriers? especially when ur ships are big cruisers, destroyers or frigs and have more than enough space for 8 harpoons.<br><br>antiship just isnt the primary mission of USN non-carrier ships. aegis cruisers wif 20 times the displacement of our MCVs carry the same number of harpoons, and their Perry-class frigate only has 4 harpoons.

Read again.<br><br><blockquote>i just meant that the main role of USN escorts is fleet air defense, antisubmarine and tomahawk shooting etc, not really antiship which is borne mainly by carrier planes</blockquote>Yesh i know , but if u read by previous post real properly , i stated that not all naval deployment of the USN include carriers , thus how are USN combatant going to defend themselve if their deployment didnt include a carrier (base on ur arguement that the antiship role is borne by carrier planes)?<br><br>So in conclusion , i agree that aircrafts are the main anti-shipping medium to sink enemy ships but onli in a carrier fleet. To be precise , the Harpoon is still the primary Anti-ship Missile of the US Navy Ships.<br><br><blockquote>thus USN ships carry fewer harpoons than other navies' ships (eg our MCV) relative to their size... (aegis and MCV have same harpoon load but the size is 20 times different)</blockquote>I dun understand. A Burke class carry 8 Harpoon which is the same with our MCV. Ur arguement that USN carry fewer harpoons is wrong but then u didnt stop and say that 'aegis and MCV have same harpoon load'. Isnt that a contridiction?<br><br><blockquote>their harpoons are more for use when no planes are around or on targets of opportunity...</blockquote>Yah so am i right to say that the Harpoon is the main ASM of the USN ships? Note that i didnt say the main Anti-shipping medium of USN carrier fleet.<br><br><blockquote>havent heard of USN ships ever firing their harpoons in anger.</blockquote>Not that i know .<br><br><blockquote>also that the "guided munitions and standoff weapons" joeblack mentioned were indeed harpoons, not JDAMs.</blockquote>U read again. His sentence structure is susgesting that JDAMs and Popeye are stand-off guided weapons which are hard to shoot down. Base on my knowledge , JDAM is not a stand off weapon and it is relative easy to shoot down ( base on the fact that JDAM is a unpowered munition and SAMs were proven to be able to shoot down 155mm round ).<br><br>Quote from Joeblack :  ''One can argue that it is far easier to down an ASM <span style="font-style: italic;"><strong>than a guided standoff munition like Popeye or JDAM</strong></span>.''<br></div>

They will then be manned by NS men of former RSN's regulars &amp; NSF of RSN which will be formed the 192 &amp; 193 sqn of the RSN. They have annual ICT just to get familiar with their boat/ships.<br><br>To what extent the requisition is I really have no idea except I am sure some tugboat,some merchant vessels for replenishment.<br><br>I hope my reply could ans yr qn.<br></div>

AFAIK harpoon was a purpose-designed ship-to-ship missile first, only then adapted for air launch. the designers could well have had air launch in mind, but harpoon was primarily meant for ship use.<br><br>and neither is it short ranged by any means. perhaps only when u compare it wif sunburn or tomahawk...<br><br>as for the tomahawks, it was only practical to use if u had a good idea of where the enemy ship would be after the missile had travelled a few hundred miles at subsonic speed. which works out to at least half an hour... more than enuf time for the enemy to make a lucky turn out of the missile's seeker range.<br><br>foxtrout8... sorry to cut in, but if u were any sensible admiral would u have ur big warships running arnd without ASMs even if u had powerful carriers? especially when ur ships are big cruisers, destroyers or frigs and have more than enough space for 8 harpoons.<br><br>antiship just isnt the primary mission of USN non-carrier ships. aegis cruisers wif 20 times the displacement of our MCVs carry the same number of harpoons, and their Perry-class frigate only has 4 harpoons. USN doctrine is indeed different from other navies, but that dont mean they dont mount harpoons on their ships when it wont hurt to do so.<br><br>and ure right, the harpoon is indeed their main naval spear. all those guided munitions joeblack toks abt (in an antiship context) are harpoons launched from F-18s. tell me the harpoon is an unguided munition...</div></blockquote>The harpoon is their primary ship to ship missile however it's range is medium....long range would be like the AS-4,the SS-20 and even the tomahwak.By the way the Tomahawk ship to ship is armed with a radar and GPS seeker head meaning it is the same as the harpoon when it comes to finding a target.It's usually lead there by an AWACS.<br><blockquote>Yesh i know , but if u read by previous post real properly , i stated that not all naval deployment of the USN include carriers , thus how are USN combatant going to defend themselve if their deployment didnt include a carrier (base on ur arguement that the antiship role is borne by carrier planes)?<br><br>So in conclusion , i agree that aircrafts are the main anti-shipping medium to sink enemy ships but onli in a carrier fleet. To be precise , the Harpoon is still the primary Anti-ship Missile of the US Navy Ships</blockquote>Actually the USN seldom depolys without air cover...be it airforce or navy planes.At the very least they try to keep a P-3 near it.It would be interesting to note that while they carry Harpoons they usually carry more Tomahawk SSM's into combat.Usually around 10.<br>Note the Tomahawk SSM is different frm the land version TLSC(or something like that)I think the only difference is the warhead.<br>Anyway<br><blockquote>I dun understand. A Burke class carry 8 Harpoon which is the same with our MCV. Ur arguement that USN carry fewer harpoons is wrong but then u didnt stop and say that 'aegis and MCV have same harpoon load'. Isnt that a contridiction?<br></blockquote>What he meant to say is that at most the USN ships carry 8 harpoons.Which in terms of ratio is little compared to what our ships carry and their size!I mean a Crusier or Destroyer carrying the same number as an MCV when it can easily carry alot alot more.<br><blockquote>Yah so am i right to say that the Harpoon is the main ASM of the USN ships? Note that i didnt say the main Anti-shipping medium of USN carrier fleet.</blockquote>Some sources i read say the penguin is the main anti shipping missole now....cuz it can be chopper launched though the harpoon is kept just incase.<br><blockquote>I think the point is that for the US Navy, the structure of the navy itself is centred on the carrier battlegroups.
