            <div class='col-md body'><br><strong>AN/MPQ-53 </strong><br><br>The AN/MPQ-53 is a frequency-agile multifunction G/H- Band radar group which performs<br><br>surveillance,<br>Identification Friend-or-Foe (IFF),<br>tracking and guidance, and<br>Electronic Counter Measures (ECM) functions<br>entailed in the Patriot tactical air defence missile system. The antenna array is a 2.44 m diameter, 5,161-element phased-array planar configuration carried on a semi-trailer chassis. The antenna unit has separate arrays for target detection and tracking, missile guidance and IFF functions. The last of these tasks is carried out by an AN/TPX-46(V)7 interrogator, using a supplementary array adjacent the main circular search and track array on the antenna unit. Other supplementary arrays are for sidelobe cancellation and missile guidance signal reception.<br><br>The 3 to 170 km range radar performs its surveillance, tracking, guidance and Electronic Protective Measures (EPM) functions in a time-shared manner by using the system's computer to generate action cycles that last in milliseconds. Up to 32 different radar configurations can be called up with the beams tailored for long range, short range, horizon and clutter, guidance and EPM functions in terms of their power, waveform and physical dimensions. The data rate for each function can also be selected independently to give 54 different operational modes so that, for example, a long-range search can be conducted over a longer time period than a horizon search for low-altitude pop-up targets. None of the functions requires any given time interval which therefore allows a random sequence of radar actions at any one time, considerably adding to an attacker's ECM problem. The search sector is 90Â° and the track capability is 120Â°.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Below from sinodefence.com<br><br>KS-1 Surface-to-Air Missile<br><br>NAME: Kaishan-1 (KS-1)<br><br>TYPE: All-altitude medium- to long-range surface-to-air missile system<br><br>INVENTORY: Unconfirmed reports stated that the modified KS-1A SAMs has already entered service with the PLAAF Air Defence Troops near Taiwan Strait.<br><br>PROGRAMME<br><br>The KS-1 is an all-altitude, all-weather, and multi-target engaging capable medium- to long-range surface-to-air missile system first revealed in the 1991 Paris Airshow. The missile was originally designed as the second-generation medium- to long-range SAM to replace the ageing HQ-2, but the programme was delayed due to unsatisfying performance and the introduction of the more capable Russian S-300.<br><br>DESIGN FEATURES<br><br>The KS-1 was reportedely first tested in 1989. The system is highlighted by its SJ-212 phased array radar, with a search range of 115 km, a tracing range of 80 km and guiding range of 50 km. The radar is working at G-band, being able to guide six missiles to attack three to six targets. It is also said to have an impressive anti-jamming capability.<br><br>Derived from the second- (upper-) stage of the HQ-2, the KS-1 missile has a slant range of 42 km, boosted by solid rocket engine. Apart from aircraft, the missile could also shoot down air-to-surface missiles. The KS-1 missile is comparable in size to the Russian S-300, but can only be launched from a fixed slant launcher, each mounting two missiles, which caused longer reaction and re-loading time.<br><br>A typical KS-1 battery consists of a phased-array radar guidance radar station, four twin-rail launchers mounted on a flatbed trucks or a four-leg pedestal, and associated reload, test, and maintenance vehicles. A total of 24 missiles, including 8 ready-to-launch missiles, are available to the battery.<br><br>SPECIFICATIONS<br><br>Missile Length: 5.6 m<br>Missile Diameter: 0.4 m<br>Missile Wingspan: 1.2 m<br>Launch Weight: 900 kg<br>Propulsion: Solid rocket booster<br>Operating Altitude: 0.5 ~ 27 Km<br>Operating Range: 7 ~ 42 km<br>Maximum Speed: 1,200 m/s<br>Missile Manoeuvrability: 20 g<br>Guidance: Radar command<br>Warhead: 100 kg HE fragmentation, with radio frequency proximity fuze<br>Single Shot Hit Probability: N/A<br><br>I estimate its Single Shot Hit probability to be in the high 80%s<br><br>The range of its search radar is 115km, not too bad, can use as some kinda landbased early warning platform.   Maximum engagement range is about 50km.<br><br>If it really has that good ECCM capabilities, means its probably hard to decoy it with chaff too.  Hence, the only measures against such a system is low-altitude + terrain masking.  And taking out its guidance radar before it can shoot.   I can see why RSAF chose the F-15T now.<br></div>

However, the todayÂ’s NG SAM is mobile, it usually uses Electronically Scanned Array(ESA) Radar, So  if HARM against such ESA target, specially AESA target, the range of AGM88 is much shortened and the possibility of it  been cheated is increasing as well! AESA radarÂ’s beam scan can perform so many types. Sometimes, it does cheat those anti-radiation Missiles like HARM neatly. To deal with those NG TVM guided SAMs + ESA radars. AGM-88 HARMÂ’s maximum range wonÂ’t exceed 50km!</div>

The Harm Targeting System on the F-16s collect all the radar emissions from the Radar Warning Reciever, which includes all the radars that are emitting, have emitted.  And they include everything from search radars, to tracking and guidance radars.  I believe it also includes naval radars.<br><br>The pilot can actually select which radar to shoot the Harm at.   Whether the target is still emitting or not, I'm guess the HTS would still contain the coordinates which the radar was at.<br><br>I'm not clear with the nature of AESA radars tho.  I know they scan a lot faster, hence the emissions would only be detected for a short while.  But thats not a problem with a HTS? Unless the radar is a mobile one... But I'm not aware of any mobile SAMs that launches medium range missiles.<br><br>If the SAM is using an AESA Radar, I'm betting on the part where it has to actually lock on to me before i launch a HARM at it.  Since thats the part where it has to keep its radar on in order to guide its weapon at me.   Since no Medium Ranged SAM radars are highly mobile yet,  I'm hoping the emitter will still be there wan my HARM slams in on it.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Ha, HTS just provides you a simple machine solution, but how reliable is that solution? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br>The HarmÂ’s infamous only record of knocking out an AESA radar happened in 2003, When a USAF F16 launched an AGM88 harm, destroyed a friendly unitÂ’s MPQ-53 radar for guiding the Patriot SAM.<br><br>ASEA is the best way to count ani-radiation missile, 1 of the features the ASEA has is its low-probability of intercept ( LPI) , if you know the F22Â’s APG77 ASEA, you probably heard of this LPI. short to instantaneous scanning rates of the AESA contribute to this LPI feature, but not all, some other advantages of the ASEA can also make the Radar Warning Receiver's interception distance much shortened if compared to old style mechanic driven radar and increase the difficulties for the HARM mission computer to analyze those signals fast enough.<br><br>BTW, Cheating Anti-radiation missile is not that a tough task as compared to jamming an AAM or SAM</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Well, jamming AAMs and SAMs has never been easy.  In fact... they whole idea is  to make them crank more and more power to their guidance radars to burn through the jamming so that HARM's can target them more effectively.<br><br>And I do agree that SAMs with AESA radars and perhaps active radar guided missiles would be a challenge for SEAD aircraft and pilots.<br><br>But, killing SAMs is not just going up to 20000ft, broadcast the wild weasel's presence and wait to get shot at, and hopefully return a HARM.  That could be just one component of it.  There could be a 2nd package with Mavericks and CBUs in the weeds, waiting for the location of the SAM, ready to shove its payload down the Air Defense Team's throat.  I guess, going against modern air defence systems has become an art, no longer just science.<br><br>No air defence systems are perfect, nor undefeatable.  U just have to peel them layer by layer, and u'll get there.<br><br>But point taken tho.  I'd hate to go up against any SAMs using an AESA radar.</div>
