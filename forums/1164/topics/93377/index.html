            <div class='col-md body'>One man's meat is another man's poison.<br><br>Terrorist to you may be someone's patriot.<br><br>But to end this we must try and understand why the Chechens in Russia did waht they did.<br><br>To understand one person's actions, no matter how illogical, first try to put yourself in their shoes.<br><br>Here is an imaginary scenario:<br><br>Imagine if you're a young man in Singapore 1942 occupied by the Japs.<br><br>The Japs are killing Singaporeans brutally every day. Remember all the torture, machinegunning, cutting off heads and raping of women and children?<br><br>You see dead Singaporeans, tortured Singaporeans and perhaps your family, relatives and friends have suffered casualties.<br><br>You and fellow Singaporean young men and women are putting up armed resistance. But the Japs are too powerful and a lot of you die for very few Japs killed. And for every armed action you take, the Japs kill even more innocent Singaporeans in revenge.<br><br>The fight isn't going well. No other nation is giving you any outside support and some of your comrades - including our very important resistance leader Lim Bo Seng - are held prisoner by the Japs. Possibly to be executed soon.<br><br>One day your resistance group leader orders you to go to Japan and take a school hostage. The goal is to bring attention to the sufferings of Singapore and our fight for freedom. You also want to make a last ditch effort to secure the release of Lim Bo Seng and other freedom fighters before their execution, which will surely dinish off the resistance.<br><br>The chance the Japanese will agree is very slim. But if they don't then they must be prepared that we will kill our Japanese hostages.<br><br>You would most definitely make the ultimate sacrifice and have to be prepared to kill your hostages. The Japanese people, you must remember, support their Emperor and the war effort. A lot of the brutal Japanese soldiers are young lads, much like the kids you might have to kill in Japan. And Japanese kids one day become Japanese soldiers.<br><br>So, the million dollar question is: would you go? Would you want to make a patriotic sacrifice for Singapore and possibly save Lim Bo Seng?</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Personally I don't think LBS would want anyone to risk his life to save his &amp; he would rather die then have people rescue him through the use of children as hostages.<br><br>Tvdog, you've single handedly dishonour all freedom fighters around the world especially those from WW II.  You've tried to merge the defination of a terrorist &amp; a freedom fighter as a single entity thereby making the actions of the terrorist seems almost justifiable.<br><br>Its true, some of the tactics used by freedom fighters are not much different then that of a terrorist.  However, freedom fighters have always target political leaders, leaders in the economic world, policemen &amp; military personnel.  They try never to involve civilians into the their fight as their reason for fighting is for the people.  Just check the IRA record, they maybe classified as terrorist by the British government but they have never shot at childrens or blow them up.  IRA's targets have always been British government related.  So IRA can be consider as Freedom fighters.<br><br>Fidel Castro would probably chew his cigar if he knew you were trying to associate him to a terrorist who kills children.<br><br>Todays terrorist as we all know, have a no-holds-bar to who they can use as targets or who they can kill as long as it rattles the world.  Take the recent Jarkarta bombing, what did they got out of it?  No Australian or foreign civilian were killed, only 8 INDONESIANs were killed.  And they claimed to fight for the Indonesian people.<br><br>A freedom fighter use of terror is aim at terrorizing the government, while a todays terrorist is aim at not only the government but everyone who doesn't submit to them.<br><br>And so to answer your question, no I would not be a terrorist to save even my own kin.  I would, however, be a sniper &amp; put a bullet to LBS to end his missery.  His death would have been more honourable.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>tvdog, *lol* you sound damn pek chek with our resident clown! Remember, letting him get to you means that he has is achieving his meagre (and pointless) objectives in life.<br><br>Anyway, in response to your question... does the means justify your end? and does this mean ANY course of action to achieve your desired outcome? i don't think so..... could there have been anyway to change the equation to achieve the desired outcome?<br><br>Given a choice, yes i'm going to have to take somebody hostage. It wouldn't be children and women though. If possible, it would be military personnel, prob someone high ranking enough to draw attention. I would not take anyone hostage to "make a statement or highlight the suffering of women/children", this reasoning and rationale to me is too superficial and does not warrant a hostage situation. But if i had to take a political/military figure hostage IN EXCHANGE for one of mine, yes i would do it.<br><br>What seperates a terrorist from a freedom fighter? ideals? methods of fighting? race perhaps? (don't laugh about that race bit, you and i know that if someone is from the middle eastern region they would be labelled as terrorists STRAIGHTAWAY) I think the difference is simply is the PUBLIC PERCEPTION of your group of freedom fighters/terrorists. You may have started out as freedom fighters, but because of your tactics and fallout from possible situations, end up being labelled as terrorists. In my opinion, that was what happened to the Basque Separatists, once seen and welcomed by the general population as freedom fighters, now seen as ruthless terrorists despised by all.<br><br>P.S. if i were some low-level foot soldier, i would refuse to take part in any situation involving children much less kill any. I don't believe in blind faith nor partaking in group-think mentality of monkey see monkey do. Doing it in full knowledge that i would be labelled a "chicken-shit" or "bo-chee" by my peers. Even as a soldier where i was expected to follow commands to the letter, i did not follow blindly (something which caused my boss some stress when i was an NSF.. har har! luckily he was quite patient).</div>

The imaginary leader of the resistance decides on this drastic measure to save him. What then?<br>the point tvdog is making is a good one. there r 2 sides to a coin. yes what the chec terrorists did were wrong. but yes, they have a reason for what they did too.</div>

For a minute there I thought I had just written a load of rubbish nobody can understand.<br><br>If I were to answer the question myself...<br><br>YES, I would agree to go for the mission. YES, the ends does justify the means.<br><br>Why? Do I want to kill women and children?<br><br>Of course not. Beisdes, the point is NOT to kill the women and children. It is to use them to bargain for the life of LBS.<br><br>But even if I don't go, the commander will someone else to go.  So this suicide terrorist mission is going ahead with or without me. But if I am there, I won't be shooting at the hostages. So with me there there will be one less gun firing at women and children.<br><br>The main reason I would go is because I would do what it takes to continue to fight for the freedom of my country. Preventing the execution of LBS by the Japs is one sure way the fight will go on. If we don't win our freedom, then the Japs will continue to slaughter innocent Singaporeans for a long time to come.<br><br>And if the Japs come to their senses, then no women or children need to get hurt during the mission. We would only release the hostages and surrender after LBS is back in the hands of the resistance forces. Of course, none of us hostage takers should expect to go home alive.</div>
