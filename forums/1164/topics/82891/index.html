            <div class='col-md body'>Singapore - The island state has taken the first step into converting her Army into a 3G army with the introduction of 3G mobile phones to all current and new NS men for the duration of their service. Army spokesperson Corporal(NS) Tan Koo Kooh said today, "We've been emphasising 3G for quite some time and now it's great that we can finally provide world-class equipment with the best quality of service thanks to Singtel providing us with a solid 3G network. It'll also provide a great tactical advantage and force multiplier now that unit commanders can communicate with their men via their mobile phones."<br><br>Many parents of NS men have applauded the move; many saying that now their sons can now call them, especially when going through the very stressful BMT period. Said one parent, "It's great! Now I can provide better emotional support to my son who's had a very difficult time adjusting to the food in camp and the constant teasing by the other recruits."<br><br>Other NS men has found other uses for their 3G phones. Corporal Eric Song said, "I totally love my new phone. It was good to be able to place bets for the Euro 2004 football matches from the comfort of my bunk. What's better is that I don't have to use my own personal handphone and incur costs calling my girlfriend in NUS"<br><br>Even with the new 3G phones, there has been some criticisms from both the public and NS personnel. Some have complained that only Nokia models were given out and not other models. Army clerk Sergeant(NS) Sam Tsung said he would have liked it better if there had been a larger variety of phone models to choose from; "I've always been using Samsung phones for quite some time and it's disheartening to be using a Nokia. I believe their standards of design has fallen." Others have complained about the MINDEF's misallocation of resources. Man on the street Mr. Ahmad Alqaed, "Giving all those phones to NSmen is wrong. They could waste it all on chatlines which I hear is very popular with teens. They could have used the money and spend it on more serious things like a redesign of the awful Army uniforms or good Nike boots or more PCs so that they can practice combat skills using CounterStrike and Battlefield Vietnam". - Reuters<br></div>
