Owning a full-auto weapon requires one to jump through a lot of hoops. The overwhelming majority of privately-owned self-loading rifles in this country are semi-automatic, <span style="font-style: italic;">not</span> full-auto.<br><br>A basic, no-frills M4 with a 16" barrel and plain iron sights can be purchased at a typical gunstore here for anywhere between $700 and $1000. You can save a lot of money if you are willing to buy the individual parts and build the rifle yourself; I've assembled many M4/AR-15 rifles for members of our gun club, and the total cost of parts for a typical basic M4-type rifle comes to around $550 (more if the member wants to add 'upgrades').</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Meia is correct.. most self loading rifle in the US are semi auto for the civilian market! even those new FN P90 , P2000, the new SIG556 are all semi!<br><br>FA weapons are very expensive here in the US becasue of the supply and demand.. as an investment point of view I feel a FA class 3 weapon keep increase in value everyyear ! So! it is a good investment piece !<br><br>A lot of states do not allow or have to make people jump thru hoops to get it,,,, so sad! fortunatley I live in  a state that is CLass 3 freindly! So! owning and getting a C3 weapon is not that bad ! just lots of paper work!<br><br>Prices of semi auto has been stable ... not crazy ... what you see in those prices are about right.... M16-M4 prices have stabalize and again! there is so many manufactuer making them, price I doubt will go up! those prebans that is ban prices has been stable too! a typical Galil ARM is still $2400 and up, HK93-91 series is still $2000 and up, Steyr AUG is still in the $3k range.<br><br>I buy a lot from a few distributors like<br><br><a href="http://www.aimsurplus.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.aimsurplus.com/</a><br><br><a href="http://www.southernohiogun.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.southernohiogun.com/</a><br><br>these prices are dealer price!  individual would expect about 15% more! the prices quoted on the website above seems reasonable.<br><br>DaveC!</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Are you guys trying to trade Guns too?<br><br>"A 30-YEAR-OLD Singaporean pleaded guilty yesterday to trying to supply 20,000 assault rifles to a shady Syrian arms dealer last year.<br>Colin Mak Yew Loong admitted to conspiring with B.R. Chaandrran, 45, to move the AKMS assault rifles, valued at US$3.4 million (S$5.4 million), from Bulgaria to Syria.<br><br>Chaandrran is denying the charges.<br><br>In court yesterday, it was revealed that Chaandrran was an employee of Dannhauser, a company registered to deal in strategic goods such as weapons and ammunition.<br><br>When his company refused to supply a shady arms dealer in Syria, Chaandrran is alleged to have pulled off the deal on his own.<br><br>He roped in Mak, the managing director of a Swiss-based firm specialising in computer software, who helped broker the deal between the Bulgarian seller and the Syrian buyer and hid the transaction with false documents.<br><br>Acting on a tip-off, Customs officers moved in and found incriminating e-mail messages, exchanged between May and September last year, in Mak's computer. They also found that he had acted as broker for the cargo without having first registered with Customs.<br><br>Deputy Public Prosecutor Lee Cheow Han said it was not necessary for the guns to pass through Singapore and that even though the delivery was not made, the act of brokering the deal without registering to deal in strategic goods was an offence.<br><br>Mak is the third Singaporean caught for illegal arms dealing, but the first to be prosecuted here for brokering in strategic goods.<br><br>He tried to convince District Judge Wong Keen Onn to hear the case in camera, away from public eye or the media. The DPP objected to this request, arguing that the case did not involve any public security issues. The judge dismissed the application.<br><br>Mak also asked the court to order the media not to identify him. He said his life would be in danger. But he was unable to provide any evidence to prove this.<br><br>The case will be next heard on July 7.<br><br>The AKMS belongs to the AK47 family of carbines, the favoured weapons of terrorists.<br><br>Two other Singaporeans have been caught overseas for illegal arms dealing.<br><br>Ronald Chia Kia Cheng, 60, a retired senior SAF officer who runs a company trading in weapons and security equipment, was arrested in San Diego in April. He was trying to buy American carbines, also for potential buyers in Syria, which remains on the US arms embargo list.<br><br>The other case, blown open in Hawaii in April, involved Ibrahim Amran, 26, and three Indonesian men. They were trying to buy a stash of weapons, including aircraft missiles and Heckler &amp; Koch sub-machine guns, for US$3.3 million.
