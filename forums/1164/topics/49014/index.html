            <div class='col-md body'>By David Boey<br><br>THE crack Commando unit has been barred from competing for one of the military's top honours because of cheating involving record-keeping and fitness scores.<br><br>Several personnel from the 1st Commando Battalion are also facing disciplinary action.<br><br>This is believed to be the first time a Singapore Armed Forces (SAF) unit has been booted out of the competition for the Best Combat Unit award. It is a major blow to the Commandos, who hold the record for having won the annual award 17 times, since the contest started in 1969.<br><br>The battalion last won it in 2001. Last year, it was edged out of the top spot by the 40th Singapore Armoured Regiment. The red berets' bid to reclaim the honours, given out every year during SAF Day celebrations on July 1, ended late last year.<br><br>In response to The Straits Times' queries, the Defence Ministry (Mindef) yesterday confirmed that irregularities were uncovered in late 2002 in the logistics or storekeeping records of one of the sub-units of 1st Commando Battalion. There were also discrepancies in the individual fitness test scores reported by two of the unit's specialists, who handle the stores.<br><br>A ministry spokesman said: 'The SAF takes a serious view of such matters. As a result, the unit was disallowed from participating in the Best Unit Competition for the year. This is to uphold the integrity and high standards of the competition.' Disciplinary action is being taken against the individuals concerned.<br><br>Word of the Commandos' ban has been making its rounds in defence-linked Internet chatrooms.<br><br>It is believed that storekeepers, who are tasked with managing all supplies from light bulbs to spare tyres, doctored some paperwork to account for missing items.<br><br>Army inspectors unmasked the cover-up during a logistics readiness inspection at the battalion. The inspection, which assess the level of competence of storekeepers in SAF units, is part of the selection process in the best-unit competition.<br><br>The year-long assessment also grades SAF units on matters like battle readiness, administrative efficiency, marksmanship, manpower issues and the way the unit handles security matters.<br><br>The unit with the highest overall score receives the Best Combat Unit trophy from the President during the SAF Day parade on July 1. The winning unit also gets to safeguard the SAF Colours - a top honour reserved for the best unit in the SAF.<br><br>The 1st Commando Battalion, based at Hendon Camp near Changi Point, has traditionally been regarded as the leading contender for the trophy because some of the fittest and most motivated national servicemen are selected for commando training.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Judging from this report....i think this yearly SAF best unit competition has a dark unhealthy "Enronesque" side to it. From people i know, this 'cooking the books' business is widely practiced...even during my NSF days. Of course, each unit practices it to varying degrees<br><br>Being an army in peacetime (something to be thankful for anyway) i guess everything is all 'paper-play"..no two ways abt it <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_confused.gif" alt="Confused" title="Confused"><br><br>i remember during a time in Starlight...when i overheard a ROC personnel remarking that the SAF is really obsessed with 'papers' when he observed that lots of SAF forms change hands during handing over and taking over of eqmt.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>last time i heard from an ex commando guy that they went training somewhere in spore and they lost a milan round, whole thing was covered up and they went to win best unit. another fren of mine who was at TAB FDS told me of an incident in 96/97 when airbases will have exercises to simulated war time and commandos are sent to attack TAB. What the commandos did was to switch off their laser vest and the PDF reservists cannot 'kill' them as the vests are deactivated. So the reservists were very du lan with commandos and in the middle of the night instead of exercise they were going to fight each other, the accessors step in to stop the fight. From there onwards, commandos were never involved in air base exercises. what rsaf do is get FDS from another airbase to 'attack' the airbase having exercise.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Is it really that good? Look at the typical scholar's career. Its already mapped out the minute he puts pen to paper. He'll supposed to fast-tracked up the ladder, usually from a middle level position, supposedly for him to gain experience. His term there is usually more or less fixed, until the next step up and so on until he arrives where it's been planned for him.<br><br>That sounds fine and good in theory, but then the road to hell is paved with good intentions<br><br>He is assured of that promotion even if his performance is average or mediocre, barring major f***ups. So what happens is most of them taken the safest, and most risk averse path. Hey, if I don't do anything risky, nothing will go wrong right? No controversial (or even remotely controversial) decisions are made, nothing of substance gets done, major decisions get buried under red tape until scholar boy moves up the ladder and hands over the decision making reponsibility to the next guy, who more often than not, is another scholar and the process repeats itself over and over again.<br><br>An overblown scenario? Not from what I have seen first hand myself. While I was in NS years ago, we got wind of a new system "to be implemented in the next year". When I left for my studies 1 1/2 years later, it had yet to be implemented, and when I came back 4 years later to serve my balance, the "new system" had been in place all of 2 weeks(No kidding). The system was riddled with kinks (not SAF's fault, every new system is like that) but what was particularly galling was the "scholars" in position to make decisions to iron out the kinks refused point blank, preferring to let the onus fall on another scholar who was obviouslly not too keen on making THAT decision and passed it around like a hot potato. With the result that the guys down the pecking order suffered.<br><br>Whats new?<br></div>
