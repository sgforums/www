            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by Viper52:</div><div class="quote_body">Is it really that good? Look at the typical scholar's career. Its already mapped out the minute he puts pen to paper. He'll supposed to fast-tracked up the ladder, usually from a middle level position, supposedly for him to gain experience. His term there is usually more or less fixed, until the next step up and so on until he arrives where it's been planned for him.<br></div></blockquote>I agree...i think that's one of the major flaws. Let's have some perspective, it'll be dumb of SAF, let alone any organisation, not to want to recruit the nation's best and brightest. Scholarships is definitely a way to seek'em out.<br><br>But with this fast-track thingy, i'm afraid that SAF is at risk of losing it's soul (warrior soul that is). Sure, being able to write well and plan ahead is well and good. That's what a staff officer must be good at. But an army can't fight with staff officers...it needs leaders...people who inspire and lead by example. I've know of an OC whose men would do anything for him..because they know he really cares for them. Men can tell whether their leaders are genuine or not. When they know that their leader is behind them, instead of climbing their backs for the crabs and stars, they will go for excellence. I'm sure this quality is something that can be found in peacetime too. Mindef needs to put its ear to the ground when it comes to assessing people for promotion. Ask questions like "What does his subordinates and peers think about him? Is he a screamer or is he cool as a rock under pressure" Let the answer factor heavily in promoting junior and middle-management officers (scholars or not).<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Now the critical question is: Can we change the system even if its discovered to be flawed? As it is most of the decision makers today are the scholars (i.e the beneficiaries of the system). Now should the day come when the system's failings become painfully obvious to everyone else and a source of embarrassment to Singapore, will these scholars stubbornly cling on to the system that put them there in the first place? Or can we trust that these people will put the country's interests above that of their pride and slaughter whats already their "sacred cow"?<br><br>Would you?</div>

Perhaps some of you may already know, in the US, they have this famous vietnam vet called Col David Hackworth (who is one of the founders of SFTT). He writes a very widely read weekly syndicated op-ed called "Defending America" which can be found in www.hackworth.com where he exposes wrongdoings or serious flaws in the military. It gets the attention of lawmakers there. Needless to say, he is persona non grata with the military suits<br><br>Thinking aloud: "How i wish the most very senior level fella in MINDEF is listening or reading these stuff"</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Agreed.  And its not as if these storemen and supply supervisors can DON'T cover up.  As it seems, the cover up for this kinda thing is passed from the previous batch down to the next batch.  So much crap that the next batch HAS to cover up also.<br><br>And imagine what would the CO do to the poor storeman if he refuses to cover up and do everything by the book?  It will definitely cause the unit to do badly for the best combat unit competition if such cover ups were suddenly exposed and investigated thoroughly.  These storemen also LAN LAN have to cover up lor.  And now when their cover up is discovered, they will definitely be blamed for this.<br><br>Its such a sad case.  If the entire SAF logistics is like that, can the SAF fight effectively?  What if the equipment thats supposed to be there on paper... is actually not?  The SAF invests huge amounts of money on logistics software, and so many units can't be bothered to use it, rather relying on their own system to manage their logistics.  And when they need something, the fall back on the primitive system of requests.<br><br>If there is a waste of money on the part of SAF, its not just the CDO.  But a majority of units out there, for failing to make full use of the software and equipment it has put in place for proper logistics handling.<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by Viper52:</div><div class="quote_body">Putting the blame squarely on some lowly logistics spec or enlistee and hanging him will not help matters. Thats called scapegoating.<br><br>We need to use this incident to realise that this culture of one-upmanship and elitism, if taken too far, will do no good in the long run, and examine on ways to change this mindset. The posts about the actions of the Commandoes by the other posters just goes to show that this competitive mindset has been taken too far. To the point that winning is everything, never mind how you get there (Switching off your MILES is cheating)<br><br>Tripwire, you may have been too harsh on the SAF in your post, but you're spot on in saying that this competitive streak has become a bad thing and is IMO already harming rather than helping the SAF in its primary role, the defence of singapore<br><br>I don't think the punishment is too harsh, had 1 CDO BN remained in the competition and won it in spite of this issue, the message we're sending out is that its ok to do such things and still be possible to get ahead. By barring them, it might actually serve as a wake up call, not just to them, but too all others who use such underhanded means to get to an end.<br><br>And no, I don't have a beef with 1 CDO BN or any of its members, my beef is with the culture and system that IMO is pervasive here, not just restricted to the military</div></blockquote></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Was from one of the log unit that got the ISO rating, and in fact was from the batch that had to work its ass off to get that blasted rating. Had guys who had to stay in shuffling papers in the middle of the night and even come back on weekends to clear stuff.<br><br>All said and done, not much to worry about when it comes to security. From what i could see, it was pretty much paperwork inspection to see that the forms and inventory tracking SOP was followed. If wartime scenario, i think confirm must cut corner liao. The inspectors didn't get to see the operational side of it tho. Seemed that they were more concerned with peacetime operation than in actual wartime scenario. All in all, i (grudgingly) say it was a good thing, cos it really cleaned up everything, after all the loose ends were finally tied up. At least the guys from the next batch didn't have the nightmare of papers and numbers not tallying.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>This is plain embarassing. Remembering what 1 Commando was like ten years ago, watching my old unit fall from grace in this manner really stings.<br><br>My loyalty still remains with the Commandos; such things are hard to let go of. However, being realistic, I am not surprised, much less offended, at the smudging of logistics records. For as long as I have known, the ethos of the unit was that maintaining stores held a very low priority in comparison to getting the job done. The implicit assumption was that in completing the mission, plenty of equipment, both ours and the oppositionÂ’s, would be damaged, destroyed or lost. This assumption was carried through to training, and in the interests of focussing upon the mission, our willingness to write off equipment was much higher than what would be typically found in other SAF units.  Certainly our logistics people earned their pittance.<br><br>Call it arrogance, callousness or just plain sloppiness, but we never paid much attention to the niceties of military life. We were often cited for not saluting other unitsÂ’ officers, employing guerrilla tactics in BTEC exercises and, in one case, painting in our own parking space at SAFTI. As Henry David Thoreau would have it, "Simplicity, simplicity, simplicity! I say, let your affairs be as two or three, and not a hundred or a thousand instead of a million count half a dozen, and keep your accounts on your thumb-nail". We were there to do a job and do it damned well, and as long as that was achieved, we were, and I do believe we remain, unabashedly unapologetic for all other transgressions.<br><br>What, if the rumours are true, shames me is that the fitness records were falsified. A full score on the fitness tests was the minimum required for the job, and a problem in this department, in light of the ethos I described above, simply will not do. If the unitÂ’s state of fitness was such that records had to be falsified, losing the Best Combat Unit competition would be a foregone conclusion anyway.<br><br>Another part of our ethos is that we tend to self-regulate, and in terms of fitness our standards would be more demanding than what Mindef sees fit to impose. As much as I would hate to disagree with a fellow Commando, I would point out to DarrenWong that if we need to falsify our records for the sake of meeting Mindef standards, we have well and truly fallen even further below our own standards. Unless things have changed radically since I left, Commandos are self-starters; on a normal day, without need for instructions, most of us would go for runs around AETI while waiting for the Duty Officer to sign everything off.  I was far from being the fittest man in my company.  However, despite all these years and a relatively sedentary lifestyle, I can still clear a 2.4 kilometre run in less than ten minutes.<br><br>Vis-Ã -vis the claims of Commandos turning their MILES harnesses off during exercises, a major shift in culture must have taken place for such practices to occur.  Apart from the usual grumbling about being unable to book out in the evenings, my lot rather looked forward to playing OPFOR and having some real fun.  Some of us wanted to try out new tactics; other simply had plenty of aggression to release.  Either way, the net effect was that the majority of us went out for the satisfaction of properly trouncing the opposition.  This, more so than any regulation, precluded the idea of turning the MILES harness off.  Again, it our self-regulatory nature manifesting itself.  If the current lot are in fact trying to win for the sake of the record, half the unit motto ought to be shamefully erased.<br><br>Those from my company who stayed on have risen to reasonably senior positions by now; the last time I checked, all of the officers were majors.  I can only sincerely hope that they remember the way we did things, and maintain or regain that standard.<br><br>A point of irony to note: thomasct pans the wild speculations made by other posters, and immediately following makes some speculations about tips of icebergs himself.  This is somewhat inconsistent.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Thomas, your assertion is in itself speculation, distinct from fact in that there is no verifiable evidence to demonstrate it.<br><br>The reported facts here are presented in the last sentence of your latest post: two specialists were caught cheating and the unit was banned from the Best Combat Unit competition.<br><br>The rest of it is pure speculation.  Is it really the tip of the iceberg?  Is there an iceberg?  If so, what exactly does the rest of the iceberg consist of?  Specifically, what else has happened to result in the banning?  Who is responsible?  Where and when did it happen?  Who made the decision to ban the Commandos from the competition?  What regulation specifies the minimum level of clearance (by this I take it you mean seniority) for such a decision to be made and for such information to be released to the press?  Exactly what is the level of clearance required?<br><br>As a measure, if the answers are facts, they will be based upon what "is"; not what "should", "could", "would" or "must be".  Framing an assertion in the negative does not make it fact; just because it is not one thing does not necessarily mean it is the other.<br><br>If you cannot present clear, factual and verifiable answers to these questions, your assertions are not based upon facts - they are speculative, educated guesses at best.  If you have no facts to answer the above questions, your statement that there must be more going on than just two specialists being caught cheating cannot be proven any more than speculations of classified missions and the deliberate intent to ban the unit from competition.  Therein lies the inconsistency.<br><br>In any case, I would not pay too much heed to any of this if I were you.  I occasionally tutor Honours students writing their theses and I get finicky about these things.</div>
