Believed that Taiwan also has one such operational airbase built inside the mountains so that fighter planes can be launched during wartime towards the north-east direction (away from mainland China).<br><br>In terms of construction technology, I believed that Singapore has already gained much from the construction of the underground MRT, underground ammunition facility and the current PLE. It will not be difficult to build one underground or hardened runway to allow the immediate launch of our fighter aircrafts to carry out counter-strike if our runway / roads are ever destroyed by enemy. Maybe we should consider if it is worth to invest $200 to $500 million building such runway. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_idea.gif" alt="Idea" title="Idea">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_idea.gif" alt="Idea" title="Idea">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_idea.gif" alt="Idea" title="Idea"><br><br></div>

Runways have to be above ground... Hangars and disperal areas can be hardened.<br><br>I think it is sufficient to protect aircraft with HAS (Huxley Book) against a first-strike by an adversary. Also when hitting a HAS, you are never sure whether there is an a/c inside.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"><br><br>We have alternate runways like lim chu kang (open source) next to Tengah. We also have other "very straight very long 6 lane highways without a permenant central dividers" in Singapore where in my opinion are alternate runways designate. This is no secret also.<br><br>In my opinion, the procedures that the RSAF practice in Lim Chu Kang road can be applied to other roadways.<br><br>It will be impossible to repair aircraft and trained personnel once they are bombed as they are both very fragile.<br><br>But not easy to bomb runways, Conventional bombs will leave a small crater which will be easily filled by trained units in in airbases (source Huxley). I don't think any potential adversary have specialized runway cratering munitions.<br><br>I think we can all restrict our discussion with sources that are unclassified and if it is plain speculation or opinions it should be clearly stated.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Although i do not doubt that the SAF have the resources and capability to construct such runways, however i doubt that the runway will constructed on the mainland Singapore. It will make more sense if it is constructed in out-laying islands due to security and space constraints. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"></div>
