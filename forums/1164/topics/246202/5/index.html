            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote>Originally posted by Wosiu:<br><strong>Hello all!<br><br>Gary1910, I think you understand ERAWA-2 tests with Panzerfaust-3 in wrong way. Angles of 15o and 30o are very close to average hit angles of hull and turret of tanks from T-72 family. So these tests results show real penetration of Panzerfaust-3 after ERAWA-2 and Panzerfaust-3 cannot pierce turret of PT-91 covered by ERAWA-2. But please dont mix PT-91 with PT-91M. Details of PT-91M armour are clasified but one thing is known, PT-91M has [b]new</strong> armour of hull and turret, much possibly with ceramcs and probably much more potent. It has also new, improved and lighter (due to aluminium boxes) version of ERAWA-2. You cited comments of some Polish tanker, but please pay attention that he compared our Leopard 2A4 with PT-91. PT-91M is different tank that PT-91. In my opinion PT-91M is more capable than Leopard 2A4, mainly because of:<br>- SAVAN-15 FCS which has capabilities only marginally lower that Leclerc FCS,<br>- new gun stabilisation system,<br>- all electric turret,<br>- new gun with accuracy 20% better than basic 2A46.<br>Sorry but I think that your MATADORS and  your Leopards 2A4 (if not modernised) are no threat to Malaysian PT-91M. Even Spikes. We have also Spikes in Poland and know that this missile is not fully effective in short ranges and in wet conditions with fog, low level of clouds etc. In case of Singapore - urban and jungle conditions - your Spikes also could be not so effective like in theory.[/b]</blockquote>For the Spike missiles, they are designed to be a dual warhead and top attack ammunitions. Thus the problem of ERA plates standing in the way is solved, as the the top part of the tank has the weakest armour thickness and most third gen ATGM desires an attack from the top. Yes, I am not advocating Spike is invincible or whatever, but the Spike suits or terrain well as our terrain here has lots of vegetations, thus an attempt to guide a missile towards the enemy using wire guidance or IR is impossible and risky, so Spike offers a choice to overcome this issues.<br><br>Regarding the Leo2, I believe SG will upgrade them for sure, as we usually buy 2nd hand weapons and upgrade them, thus using the original leo2A4 and comparing them with an upgraded PT-91M is definitely moot.</div>

If it is the former, then the Twardy is as susceptible to tungsten rounds from a 120mm L44 as any Soviet tank without any ERA. The Kontakt-5 ERA are all heavy ERA, and I highly doubt the Poles have the technology. It will also be interesting to see how the Twardy compares with real Soviet T-72s as the Poles received semi monkey models for their military. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br>As for that M'sian noob, he should know that our 2A4's configuration isn't confirmed and could well be upgraded close to 2A5's configuration.<br><br>And yes, the 2A4 also has a gun stabilisation system as do all modern Western tanks.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"></div>

But it is quite good tank with good cost-effect ratio and should be not underestimated. Also you should not underestimate Polish technology which in many branches is equal to top western technology. Poland has tradition in tank production from 1930`.

            <div class='col-md body'>Well frankly,<br><br>even though we have a forward defense policy, the chances of us attacking our northern neighbour is quite low.  Simply because we are so closely linked that hitting one will probably kill the other later anyway.<br><br>However, if the push comes to a shove, man, things are going to hurt real bad on both sides.  Why?  It's unlikely you have this "face off" of their best versus ours.  More likely it their best will roll over our normal units while ours do the same to theirs until both sides gets worn out badly.<br><br>Well next thing is, deployment. Odds that armoured vehicles rolling across the causeway is very slim.  Neither side will have the ability to do so without heavy casualties. Dont forget, the links are still narrow highways, block the first few, and you have a real kill zone formed infront and behind the barricade.<br><br>For our northern neighbour, their siting of their PT-91ms will determine if they can react to an attack from the north/south in X hours. Closer to one end means less reaction time for one and more on the other.  Not to mention the swats of now very viable oil-palm biofuel rich land in the eastern part of the country.<br><br>Even for regular forces, you still need time for mobilisation.<br><br>I realised also that modern armoured vehicles, unless very lucky getting a glancing hit, any impact from antitank weapons is going to ring and shake like hell at least when hit.  It will still suffer some damage no matter what and thus weakened in the next engagement. (Unless you have those wierd armour on abrams the cannot die kind)<br><br>Other stuff to say :<br><br>Spike performance while not mirroring that of hellfire II,  the longer versions are capable of LR-AH hunterkiller ability just like hellfire IIs.<br><br>Spike got different types one.

Please enlighten me. How, like Desert Storm is it?<br><br>Last time I checked, tanks supporting infantry is still a very legitimate use of tanks especially in our SE Asian terrain of jungle, town and city.

The Kodams Tanjungpura in Borneo will probably invites other Kodams from throughout Indon to join the fun of<br>bashing Sarawak and Sabah.
