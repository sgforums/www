It strikes with so much kinetic energy that if none of it was dispersed by the armour breaking or melting or into sound or what, <strong>an MBT hit by it would be displaced 600 meters! </strong></blockquote>Surely you jest?  I'd like to see the maths for that.<br><br>FWIW, the LOSAT penetrator is supposed to generate the equivalent of 5 times the kinetic energy of the best penetrator fielded, at that time.  Given that the KE of an APFSDS dart cannot be more than the energy contained in the firing charge ... and given that an MBT isn't sent flying back 50m when firing one ... How would a LOSAT displace a 50ton target by 600 metres?<br><br>Lets see you think up of something for this one  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>

I've read that in many places but don't know if this is more effective than smoke dischargers.</blockquote>Generating smoke in this manner is a (relatively) simple matter of injecting diesel fuel into the exhaust manifold in a controlled amount. Off the top of my head, I know that the Chally 2 and M60A3 can do this ... seen it on video. I'm sure the complete list is likely to be much longer than that.<br><br>The difference between smoke from diesel smoke generators and smoke grenade launchers is a matter of time and obscuration qualities.<br><br>Smoke grenade launchers fire their grenades off in a pre-determined pattern. The grenades explode a few metres above the tank, much like one of those fireworks air-burst. The resultant dispersed smoke pellets produce a dense screen that totally cover the firing platform in a couple of seconds. Smoke generators OTOH take much longer to produce an effective screen for the emitting tank, mainly because it is producing smoke from a single source instead of from hundreds of dispersed pellets. Think of the smoke grenades you used to chuck around and how long it took to produce effective concealment.<br><br>Smoke grenades also typically use a phospor/rubber compound as their active ingredient and this generates a screen that works not only in the visible spectrum but also in the IR spectrum, effectively concealing the platform from thermal sights. Diesel smoke OTOH only works in the visible spectrum.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Presently? No we can't use it, not to mention there are no real systems being sold out there yet.<br><br>But in the future? Certainly.

This of course will call into question the future of MBTs in the battlefield. I mean a Hummer can carry more LOS firepower then an MBT, as well as a system that can defeat all known armour threats, the advantages of an MBT having armour and firepower have been more of less negated.<br><br>Basically the armoured fist cannot punch if a technology is developed that enables a lighter, quicker rival to engage you beyond the range of your own weapon. Just as how machine guns effectively ended the days of the horse calvary and the aircraft carrier that of the battleship as king of the seas.<br><br>Eventually you might see a trend towards "tanks" that put less emphasis on passive protection (which can't protect against hyperkinetic munitions anyway), and more on active suites and having armour that is designed to protect against lower-caliber attacks, and firepower to kill just about anything in its LOS and maybe even with indirect fire. To survive the "tank" can no longer rely on taking shots and fielding multi ton armour but instead on being hidden, hitting the enemy where does not expect, as well as other tatics.<br><br>To get an idea of what is happening, the Yanks are not developing a next gen MBT to replace to M1A2, but a different concept of "tank" entirely in their FCS systems.<br><br>The "tank" is not obsolete, the idea of a mobile, protected space will always be around in various forms but it may not exist in the way we are familiar with.

The Galix system reaction time is less than one second and is reported to protect Leclerc against any known weapon on the battlefield. The Galix 13 smoke round can produce a smoke screen that includes visual and multi-band screening agents, over an arc of 120Â° to the front of the vehicle, that can last up to 30 seconds. This screen can blind any optically or IR-controlled weapon system. The IR decoy deviates the trajectory of antitank missiles controlled by an IR seeker.
