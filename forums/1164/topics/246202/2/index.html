Obviously smaller groups (plts scts)  come face to face with enemies first and the support will then react.

How big is the whole line.

If the company is agile enough, they should fall back a little and then the rear lines will provide cover fire and the correct weapons bring to fore. No sense facing something they are not equipped to do so and then when you have dead men you really have a collapsed line.</div>

From the looks of it, it isn't even the Polish derived ones, or even the latest Russian ones. Surely they at least invested in good ERA?</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>First thing first, we need to look at the PT-91M before we could go ahead with any reasonable estimation.<br><br>It is based on T-72M1, the export or monkey model of the Russian variant, estimated armour protection is 420mm RHA against KE and 480mm RHA against CE and according some estimate PT-91M with ERAWA 2 will have 640 Â– 670 mm RHA against KE and something like 1300mm  RHA against CE.<br><br>But I sincerely doubt the protection of  the ERAWA 2 as stated above.<br><br>The reason is the test below<br><br><blockquote>In May of 2000, there were presentations of Dynamit Nobel Panzerfaust 3 anti-tank grenade launchers for Polish Army as a part of marketing campaign. There were firing tests of Panzerfaust 3 armed with 3T and improved 3-T600 tandem HEAT warheads (Dynamit Nobel claims that 3T is capable of piercing 900mm RHA behind ERA and 3-T600 over 1000mm RHA behind ERA at the hitting angle of 90 degrees). On Polish testing ground 3T was fired upon armoured steel plates of 550mm RHA screened with Erawa-2 at the hitting angle of 30 degrees and 3T-600 was fired at the similar target at hitting angle of 15 degrees. In both situations German warheads pierced through Erawa-2 but then were capable of penetrating only about 400mm of RHA. Germans were surprised by the protecting level gave by Erawa-2.</blockquote>DonÂ’t be fooled by colourful presentation above, the results at 30 and 60 degrees and not at the optimum of 90 degrees( or 0 degrees of incidence , depending on how you measure it from) do not look impressive at all, let me explain, the baseline T-72M1 has armour protection of 480mm against CE, and with the fact that (rough estimation) at 30 deg(or 60 deg) only abt have half of the original penetration power and at 15 deg( or 75 deg) I think only abt have less than 1/3 of the original penetration power and they have already penetrated 400mm RHA!!!!<br><br>So in reality, Panzerfaust 3T at below 60 deg of incidence and Panzerfaust 3-T600 at below 75 deg of incidence will most likely able to penetrate the PT-91M even at itÂ’s thickest armour!!!!<br><br>Some may argue that PT-91M is more modernised than the Polish PT-91 but protection wise, it could not be dramatically higher becos of the limitation of  high ground pressure(0.94 kgf/cm sq),  &amp; after all the weight increase from 45.9 tons (PT-91) to 46.5 ton(PT-91M) only a mere 0.6 tons.<br><br>So in conclusion , protection wise, PT-91M is certainly not impressive at all.<br><br>Later I will continue with part II.............<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Of course that's assuming the PT-91 has not had its passive armour package improved by the Polish.

They probably only had the Tungsten rounds which may be of dubious quality.<br><br>Frankly, I don't even know why the M'sians picked that tank. Doesn't make much sense. A T-90  which even the Indians can afford, never mind they have even tighter budget constraints than the M'sians, would have been a better choice.<br><br>Also, who ever designed the ERA package obviously doesn't have enough experience with it. It leaves so many gaps in the protection. The Russian ERA is more compact and probably more effective.<br></div>
