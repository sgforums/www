I'm basing my questions on a layman's perspective of traction vis 2WD/4WD vehicles.  2WDs can dig themselves in by standing on the brakes and spinning the wheels.  4WDs can't ... well they could by revving the engine and dropping the clutch but this only works on soil that is on the <strong>borderline</strong> of being trafficable.  Not to mention doing your tranny and threads a world of hurt ...<br><br>IINM, tracks operate on similar principles ... as such using the tracks to dig is more a matter of happenstance rather than a deliberate action.<br><br>Can anyone clarify that tanks (or any tracked vehicle) can deliberate "dig" into hard ground that has a high VCI shear index?<br><br>The other thing that comes to mind is that like moca mentioned, tracks are designed for floatation.  Your description of mud flying and tanks spinning their tracks kinda implies that the soil is no longer trafficable ... if that is the case, is that tank going to be able to exit the position under it's own power? Or will it require a tow to get out?  I would think that implied into digging a fighting position is an implicit understand that one should be able to evacuate the position when required ...</div>

Look at the pics I posted.<br><br>And Taiwan operates bothh the M48 and M60.<br><br>They also have a twin AA gun on a chassis very similar to the M41 series. When I was in ROC in the 80s I saw a convoy of these AA tanks - very retro 1950s. The TC saluted us when we - lowly infantry types - waved to them.</div>
