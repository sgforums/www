            <div class='col-md body'>To follow on nanotubes, they are quite a bit stronger then steel (RHa)... about over 300 times stronger (48,462 kNÂ·m/kg vs. 154 kNÂ·m/kg).<br><br>Though they might have other properities unsuitable for armour that require compositing them with other more traditional materials to make their use as armour viable.<br><br>Here's some 2 year old news:<br><br><a href="http://www.physorg.com/news8947.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.physorg.com/news8947.html</a><br><br><blockquote>A year ago IsraCast reported on the development of the first commercial nano-based lubricant which was developed by the Israeli company ApNano materials. A year later we find ApNano working also on a wholly different application of their technology - shielding and protection. In recent research lead by Prof. Yan Qiu Zhu of the School of Mechanical, Materials and Manufacturing Engineering at the University of Nottingham, England, a sample of the ApNano material was subjected to severe shocks generated by a steel projectile traveling at velocities of up to 1.5 km/second. The material withstood the shock pressures generated by the impacts of up to 250 tons per square centimeter. This is approximately equivalent to dropping four diesel locomotives onto an area the size of oneÂ’s fingernail. During the test the material proved to be so strong that after the impact the samples remained essentially identical compared to the original material. Additionally, a recent study by Prof. J. M. Martin from Ecole Central de Lyon in France tested the new material under isostatic pressure and found it to be stable up to at least 350 tons/cm2. </blockquote>But hey, at 1,500 USD a gram it isn't too cheap you know.</div>

They are more likely to rely on civilian infrastructure to achieve strategic mobility for their MBTs.<br><br>And as per what ST posted, they certainly do not share the advantage of sensor and information fusion that the SAF will have once the BMS is fully operational/implemented.  I think it is a given that the TDM is well and truly behind the SAF in the Revolution in Military Affairs.<br><br>Given that, I think what they're attempting to do with PT-91M makes sense<br><br>Put yourself in their shoes ... in the event of a conflict with Singapore and the SAF pours Northwards across the Straits of Johore.<br><br>The TDM is outnumbered in sheer numbers for armoured platforms.  This makes an open meeting engagement folly.<br><br>What they do have is strategic depth ... lots of it.  They can afford to trade space for time.<br><br>Imagine a signature managed PT-91M sitting in prepared firing postions overwatching likely avenues of advance.  Using it's small silhouette, signature management and close cover of vegetation, it is likely to remain "invisible" until it moves or fire.<br><br>Say it conducts a brief ambush engagement, reverse into the cover of the reverse slope and scoots to a prepared fallback position.  This is where the improved powerpack, transmission and Diehl tracks start to make sense.<br><br>Given the likely engagement ranges, a hit by a KE APFSDS round from either party (PT-91M/Leo 2) is bound to mean game over for the other.  Hence the upgraded FCS start to make sense too.<br><br>If the TDM can string together a zone of such penny packet ambush positions, they can quite effectively stall the momentum of any advance, assuming the SAF remains casualty conservative.<br><br>Heck, imagine if whole advance comes to a temporary stop because the commander of the lead element doesn't like the bloody nose he got and wants to regroup and let the following elements move up ...  can you say Astros time?  Enough to give the commanders of the lead and following elements a bloody headache.<br><br>This trading of depth buys them time to find other means to resolve the conflict.<br><br>I've never liked platform vs. platform d**k swinging contests ... reminds me too much of childhood game of trumps.  As if my higher top speed means that my "card" beats your "card".<br><br><strong>The raw capabilities of each system/platform has to be taken within the context of the operating environment, operational doctrine and the likely OPFOR. </strong><br><br>Oh, BTW did I mention crew quality?<br><br>Cheers! <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"></div>

If it needs to employ a fluid defence by using non-prepared positions, it would find itself unable to "hull down" properly compared to western models.<br><br>This limits it's ability to make full use of whatever terrain it has to play a battle. For example, the limited depression of the soviet-style tanks was well known by the Israelis when they often engaged Arab armour in places where they knew their enemy tanks had to fully climb a berm in order to get a proper shot while the Israelis could hunker down behind a berm and get off their shots exposing only the turret.<br><br>Hence this tank would actually be unable to fight from behind a reverse slope, unless it was a prepared position that had taken out the slope.<br><br>But I'm sure the MAF have though about it, and have found ways to make up for it. Dozer blades for their tanks to dig their own positions maybe? But in a fluid battle it might be totally different.<br><br>Think their attempts to signature-manage is a response to the SAF's 3G abilities? I am no expert in the area of sensors so I'll reserve comment on how effective the measures of each side is.<br><br>And of course, I'm not entirely sure the SAF intends to pit armour on armour.

Looking at our ORBAT, that seems to be the way we're geared to fight.<br><br>It's to their advantage to try to force set piece engagements where such "soft" advantages are mitigated.
