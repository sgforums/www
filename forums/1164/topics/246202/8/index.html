            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by moca:</div><div class="quote_body">Did I say AK47?</div></blockquote><blockquote>"First hit probability of 2A46MS modernized gun compared to the original 2A46 gun was increased by 23%. In conjunction with a FCS of T-72 M2 MBT this value was even more enhanced."<br><br>Granted it's a manufacturer blurb, but just like a high grade barrel enhances a sniper rifle accuracy, a proper main gun barrel can enhance accuracy over the typical 500-rnd monkey model barrels.<br><br>What remains to be asked is whether a 23% increase in the 2A46MS equates to a similar barrel accuracy of the Rheinmetall 120mm ... ?</blockquote>Really? Maybe I read wrongly but I thought wosiu was implying the 2A47MS is 20 percent MORE precise then the L44(which I find dubious). A 23 percent increase on the 2A46 would be a much needed improvement, given that gun has a substandard mean error of 1m at 1,800m.<br><br>Of course the blurb in itself is very vauge... 23 percent hit probability increase? Under what situtation? From what facts was this probability calculated?<br><br>The numbers quote from the gunnery range is certainly a lot better then the monkey T-72 gunnery in the Gulf War, but at the same time prehaps also points out that your gunnery is only as strong as the weakest link in your chain of features.<br><br>You can have a good gun and FCS, but the limited elevation and depression of the main gun will make laying it on target troublesome in rough terrain (a fault common in the low-slung soviet designs). Let's not even talk about trying to do hull down with that thing.<br><br>Given a new turret I think the gunnery scores might be even higher, for in any case they seem somewhat lower then the Pk on the manufacturer's website. Good FCS but inability to lay the gun properly on the target prehaps?<br><br>As for the Thermal and Radar paints... I dunno, they sound gimmicky to me (ie. the length of the sentence taken to describe it might be bigger then it's actual importance  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"> ). Granted they might reduce or manage the signature of the MBT somewhat, but I doubt you are getting any kind of a stealth tank. And fire up that engine, no amount of Thermal paint will help.<br><br>We know the Yanks had been painting their U2s and SR-71s with RAM paints for decades, and that didn't stop the soviets from tracking them easily. It's a nice measure no doubt, but I wonder if it really deserves mention.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>AFAIK, the real difference between the Â“generationsÂ” of tank FCS has been the range of the Thermal Sight, and not the gun stabilization system, which has been already perfected since the first Gulf War.<br><br>The stabilization upgrades to the T-72 design were more of playing catch-up to modern standards then actually excelling in them. Once again the limited elevation and depression of the main gun is an issue when it comes to stabilization over rough terrain or when climbing and going down slopes or even bumps on the road- thereÂ’s only so much you can do with a design that was intended to be used en masse with less regard to individual unit ability and more on numbers to overrun the enemy.<br><br>Aiming the gun and keeping it on target was not a problem, but the issue of detecting your enemy before he sees you is another, hence the emphasis on getting increasingly powerful sights.<br><br>On the other hand this might be a moot argument (for us at least), given the armies that have been attempting to go network centric have been putting an emphasis on Â“sensor-weaponÂ” separation. That is, the separation of the platforms who do the detection and targeting from the weapons platforms that do the actual engagement.<br><br>This means that instead of having to manually acquire your targets yourself, this information is streamed to you from external sensors (other units closer to the target, UAVsÂ… etc) via network and your course of action is then decided.<br><br>On the other hand, while the long-range aquistion of the enemy is great in the latest-generations of Thermal Imaging Systems, they are outgrowing the range of their weapons platform (especially on use with tanks). For example, even with the ability of the SAVAN 15 to acquire a target at 5km is impressive, the tank using it (assuming a PT-91) has to close to within 2 km in order to use its rounds effectively. And within that range even a previous generation tank (with a Gulf War 1 era TIS) would have detected them by then (and itÂ’ll be a matter of who shoots first).<br><br>Tactically, the advantage of the latest Thermal Sights has not been that it allows you to engage the enemy first (unlike the first Gulf War where coalition armour could engage Iraqi tanks without even them being detected), but that it allows you to see the enemy first and take appropriate action before he receives the same intelligence (assuming he has a weaker FCS sight).<br></div>

Been "Neighbors", One had excess Equipment, another had excess manpower. "Win Win" for both. Other countries, may not be willing to enter into such situation.</blockquote>So now you finally agree that the acquisition of the Leos by Poland was not because they needed them to join NATO <span style="font-style: italic;">per se</span>?<br><br>Yah yah, bought/sold at transportation cost ... whatever.

Why carry on harping about it?<br><br><blockquote>Originally posted by kotay:<br>More importantly, you left out replying to my highlighting the diversity of platforms within NATO with the UK Challengers, French LeClercs, Italian Arietes and US M1s? </blockquote><blockquote>Originally posted by snowfox_my:<br>Why these didn't use/buy Leopards.

So case closed ... no need to try taking it off on another tangent.<br><br><blockquote><br>Tell me about the Fire Sale.

Aint that wierd?</blockquote>Not really, does each and every purchase the SAF make need to be broadcast to the world?<br><br>In any case we are getting "refurbished" tanks, so it's anybody's guess on what "refurbished" means, and until we get official confirmation all the stuff we say here unfortunately (like the ability of Pakistani Penetrators) will be mostly speculation.<br><br>All we can make are educated guesses... I am guessing the SAF isn't so hard up for cash that we are going to send our Leo2A4s into our network centric battlefield along side the digital Bx2 deaf dumb and blind. I am guessing that our military budget, which is several times that of our friends, isn't exactly hard up to afford a FCS upgrade. I am guessing that we have already looked hard at the abilities of the PT-91M before considering what system to aquire that best fits our needs.<br><br>I am also guessing (based on some data) that in terms of crew and unit survivability the PT-91 will have more stuff to worry about then the crew of a Leo2. After all, "knocked out" can both mean "penetration to ammo compartment, fire damage to turret bustle" or "penetration to ammo compartment, catastrophic kill with turret seperation". And of course, mission kill and catastrophic kill are greatly different things entirely.<br><br>That aside, the final thing I am guessing is that ST has already long though of these things before we have, and it's anyone's guess (to use the word another time) if they intend to do something about it.<br><br>But we can't know until it's offically released or mentioned, and even then the SAF might want to be coy about talking too much about what FCS and stuff it uses, even with us military buffs wanting to know about it.<br><br>Needing to mention the Savan-15 explictly along with other upgrades was an important point in selling a T-72 derived design, given the negative reputation of the type in the world market, but not so for the Leo2 which could simply be sold on the weight of its "Germans-make-good-stuff" reputation. So market forces might have something to do with it.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>on the PT91M new gun from a friend of mine<br><br><blockquote>PT-91M has as you know a slovak modernisation of Rapira gun, 2A46MS  (modernized,slovak). It has increased hit accuracy by 23%.<br>Better guns i can see only german 120mm L44 or L55, swiss one,russian/ukrainian modernisation or chineese (do not know the name, with increased kinetical energy by 30%). However Bumar Labedy is familiar only with slovak one.<br>So it's too complicated and costly to change the gun. In Poland the programme with 120mm L44 (like in Leopard 2A4) was abandoned.</blockquote>Info on the PT91M new round<br><br><blockquote>what we know however, that a military weapon research guys work over new apfsds projectile. next one. this one would have additional charge around the sabot. The apfsds amunition for t-72 is split in two parts, penetrator with sabot and propellant charge. and that's why the length of the penetrator seems to be limited (some say however that loader would accept longer penetrators anyway) and also the amount of propellant is limited. Malaysia bought new APFSDS and now they working on this next - this time the propellant will be in two parts of the amunition - in normal charge and additively around the sabot. So it could achieve biggest speed and biggest penetration.</blockquote><blockquote>The additive propellant charge around the sabot is for speed increase. Normally the amunition for T-72 (in oppose to western tanks amunition that is ine one piece) consist of 2 separate parts: propellant and projectile (sabot and penetrator). Normally propellant in one part burns at the moment of opening fire, and the projectile goes out of the barrel, then sabot breaks apart and lonely penetrator flies to the target. But the amount of propellant is limited due to construction of 2-part amunition. Now they want to add the propelant also around projectile - of course it burns also in the moment of opening fire. Two charges of propellant burn, (normal and around the sabot) and projectile leaves the barrel. </blockquote>cheers<br><br>SGT rex wrote<br><blockquote>As for the Thermal and Radar paints... I dunno, they sound gimmicky to me (ie. the length of the sentence taken to describe it might be bigger then it's actual importance  ). Granted they might reduce or manage the signature of the MBT somewhat, but I doubt you are getting any kind of a stealth tank. And fire up that engine, no amount of Thermal paint will help. </blockquote>the anti-radar, anti-thermal covering - reducing physical fields (smaller radar and thermal visibility) will make it hard to be detected, especially underneath bushes and secondary jungle.

With current materials there's only so strong a dart you can make for the diameter-length ratio. The longer and thinner the better but the projectile also becomes weaker versus other forces. And I think we are approaching the limits of what current APFSDS technology can offer)<br><br>Hence recent efforts to improve the 120 performance involved increasing the length of the gun (L55, same penetrator but with more force, so there's no need to use a slimmer dart) and the like, and less on tweaking the round. The Yanks are experimenting with smart rocket "X-rods" and the like, increasing the effective kill range of an M-1 tank to 8.6km (tested).<br><br>Currently, the most powerful dedicated AP weapon ever created (in my knowledge) is the LOSAT.
