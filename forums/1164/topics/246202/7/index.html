            <div class='col-md body'>Chey, so it's MOA?<br><br>20 percent more in MOA? As one might point out even with the capabilities of 1991-era FCS this has become a moot point. This increase in accuracy (if verified) does not equate to a pratical increase in combat effectiveness.<br><br>Unless of course in engagements that take place at really extreme range (4-5 km+), but yet again moot given most conventional KE rounds would have lost much of their effectiveness at that point and you don't usually get that kind of LOS unless you are in really good tank country.<br><br>And one does not see this in our region much.<br><br>On protection:<br><br>Uh uh, the Tankers at StragetyPage will give you a different RHA estimate for the Leo2A4 series, the estimates you put out seem to be more of the ballpark for KE protection of the ORGINAL Leo2 variant without the remodeled armour and tungsten upgrade.<br><br>As for the effectiveness of Chinese (and associated penetrators), let's just say it's a matter of much debate as well though I find it highly suspicious. The PRC does have a bad habit of overstating their stuff just for the effect of it. And of course, it's hard to verify their numbers as well.<br><br>KE is not just the end of the APFSDS equation, the design of the penetrator must be able to wistand the forces generated on impact with the target as well, or else it will simply shear or snap and be ineffective.<br><br>What this means that the Chinese must have made several advances in materials science and penetrator design for such performance to be possible... I'll file it under the same classification as the Iranian "super cruise missile and torpedo report"... interesting but unable to be fully verified.<br><br>But of course I find this suspicious for the simple reason the Yanks and Germans, (and even the russians) with far more knowledge of tank guns and ammunition have been trying to crack the current KE performance deadlock for decades and suddenly China comes up with a superpenetrator? *scratches head*<br><br><blockquote>But please know, that even if turret is not completly penetrated, tank could be eliminated by powerful impact force causing many damages of internal electronic, other systems and severe wounds of tankers. </blockquote>That would be more of an issue for Soviet derived designs like the PT-91M then Western designs. The low survivability of the T-72 design means that even a minor penetration will end up with a catastrophic kill, and I doubt this issue was rectified in the PT-91M.<br><br>On the other hand, combat experience has proved that the Western mindset towards tank designs (with emphasis on damage control) has led to AFVs that were mission capable even after having taken several penetrations (lucky shots that missed everything vital though)! And of course we had this story of a bogged down M1A1 that was shot several times before it brewed up (ammo explosion), but still remained intact and was discovered to still be working when it was finally pulled out.<br><br>In fact the destruction of any unrecoverable M1 tank to prevent capture usually involves hitting it several times with airstrikes from heavy anti armour missiles and dropping a rather large bomb on it, if possible. Just to get an idea of how difficult it is to render unusable to anybody.<br><br>What this translates to is that western designs, even after having being hit will have a far higher chance of being mission capable. And even after being knocked out will have a far higher rate of crew survival and unit recovery. The same can't be said for the traditional soviet design on which the PT-91 is based.<br><br>Not to toot any horns, but the issue of AFV/crew survivability after being hit is more of an issue of the soviet designs like PT-91M, not the Leo2.<br><br>Of course in all of this we forgot to mention that Singapore was getting <strong><span style="font-style: italic;">refurbished</span></strong> Leo2A4s... it's anybody's guess on what "refurbished" means. But I don't think it's going into battle alongside the digital Bx2 dumb, deaf and blind with last era electronics.<br><br></div>

The side hull of any MBT is also rather vulnerable, and this is no exception with the M1. And of course we have cases where Bradleys used their 25mm Bushmaster to take out T-72s (while the T-72s were generally protected against 25mm, all it needed was one round in the many to find a weak spot and set off the poor damage control measures of the T-72) .<br><br>There was this M1A1 tank which turned it's main gun into a rather sturdy wall during the Thunder Runs in Bagdad, and bent it, rendering the multimillion dollar MBT mostly mission killed from that simple action and forcing the crew to fight on their machine guns during the mission.<br><br>And it seems that often reason for taking an M1 out of the fight was not enemy fire but General Mud.<br><br>On the other hand, when the really bad stuff happens to Western designs, the crew survival rate is simply a lot higher then any Soviet design... mostly because Western designs try to avoid the trend of sticking the crew in a cramped turret with no space for spall liners, ammo stuffed all around with no space to vent the blast in the event of an cookoff after being hit.<br><br>The ultimate test of any RHA values it seems... is to really bring it into combat and let it take stuff. Which indicated that the M1A1 HA (and above variants) were actually far more protected then their "official" RHA values.

PLs read this: http://www.army-technology.com/projects/t72/ </blockquote>Err ... the link you provided has this to say:<br><br>"In June 2002, The Polish company, Obrum signed a contract with Rheinmetall Landysysteme of Germany to co-operate on the <strong>modernisation of Polish Army T-72 tanks, using Leopard 2 technology.</strong>"<br><br>How does this mean that the T-72/PT-91 will be upgraded to Leo 2s?<br><br>If I read this correctly, it means that the T-72/PT-91 will be upgraded very much like the PT-91M with western vehctronics.  In this case, they are possibly looking at the EMS-15/PERI-R17A2 sights, electrical harness and gun stabilisation system used by the Leo 2.<br><br>I would love to see you explain how the above quote equates to a replacement of the T-72/PT-91 by Leo 2s.<br><br><blockquote>It's is true that system need not be similar to inter operate (Why even the American Forces in Iraqi also when to conflict with not so compatible comms)<br><br>But NATO want to do it their way. Maybe you can highlight it to them with your wisdom. </blockquote>Okay, so NATO want to do it their way ... where does it say that part of NATO membership required Poland to buy a whole brigade of NATO/German equipment?<br><br>Where in Poland's entry into NATO was it mandated that member nations must use platforms designed/manufactured by charter NATO members?<br><br>If NATO's way is that all member nations must use Leo 2s (like what you're saying about Poland), then what about recent members like the Czech Republic, Hungary, Bulgaria, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Romania, Slovakia and Slovenia?<br><br>More importantly, you left out replying to my highlighting the diversity of platforms within NATO with the UK Challengers, French LeClercs, Italian Arietes and US M1s?<br><br>IINM, all that NATO requires for member nations is that they upgrade their C3I to be compatible with the standards in place.<br><br>Like I've been trying to say, the acquisition of Leo 2s by the Poland Land Forces were more to do with integration into the 7th Panzer Division (and ARRC) than integration into NATO.  As to why they wish to have a brigade under ARRC/Bundeswehr command, that I agree is political.<br><br><blockquote><br>Am a bit confuse, The Polish is providing a brigade strength right? If it is operating under a a Corp, or Division or Army. Do you get a discount in the number of Men provided? Sorry how is it related to the Topic of this thread? </blockquote>I think you misunderstand me here ...<br><br>The ARRC is a Corp/Army level formation.  If the Poles contribute a brigade as an independent formation, than the brigade will have to function as an independent formation attached to Corp HQ.  This would allow the Polish Brigade the freedom to use it's own hardware as an independent brigade will have it's own self-contained higher level maintenance depots.  However, Given the structure of ARRC, that is unlikely to be approved.<br><br>IINM, Poland has made a statement that it wishes to be an active member of NATO and the only way they could contribute a brigade was within the organisational structure of a division assigned to ARRC.<br><br>For a brigade to be assimilated effectively into a division, it has to be supportable by the logistics and maintenance units of the division.  If Poland insisted on using PT-91s, the 9th Panzer Division would have to enlarge their divisional support structure to cater for the new equipment ... not very ideal issit?  Hence a whole brigade of Bundeswehr stuff ... Leo 2s, Gerpards, M113s etc.<br><br><blockquote><br><strong>Forces that Operate T-72 and Leopard</strong><br>It's true that the Polish Army operate T-72(T-91) and were provided with Leopards by the Germans (Alot of Historical reasons for this move, trying to heal old wounds)<br><br>Finnish Army also operated T-72, and move to Leopard 2A4.<br><br>All had their own reasons for doing so.</blockquote>Look ... a lot of countries have purchased Leo 2s <strong>recently</strong> because the Bundeswehr have been conducting a fire sale of their surplus-to-requirements stocks ... literally in the thousands.<br><br>Not to disparage the Leo 2A4 but in alot of these purchase decisions (just like Singapore), it isn't because it represented the best available platform but rather the one with the most bang for the buck.<br><br>Go check for yourself the proliferation trend of the Leo 2s and tell me the bargain basement price was not a primary factor?<br><br>Oh BTW, Finland is not a member of NATO.<br><br><blockquote>If the chances arise, ride on a T-72(T-91) and a Leopard.  Compare it with SM-1,  World of Difference,  true T-91M is fairly new.</blockquote>Duh ...  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"></div>

Remember the politics over the M2 Bradley protection issues and what have you not.<br><br>On the other hand, nations like China, Pakistan and others mentioned do not have such systems in place, and making exaggerated claims for their systems seems to be part of official policy. IÂ’m not too sure what to make of the things like super-torpedoes, supertanks, cruise missiles and ammunition that they seem to be able to come up with the drop of a hat, but I think common sense tells us to be more sceptical of it.<br><br>Not that it isnÂ’t possible for them, but if you are claiming that you managed to crack the performance deadlock that dedicated companies of other nations with decades of experience have been working on for very long, and even tot a 30 percent increase in power in your gun and ammunitionÂ… letÂ’s just say that one needs to treat such a claim with some reserve until it can be tested by the trusted guys in the business.<br><br>But of course this is not just restricted to those countries, weapons systems are often sold with very favourable models to test their PK, while actual practice might prove something entirely different. The improved Sidewinder variants used in the Falklands were supposed to have a PK of 0.9, but in practice it turned out to be in the ballpark of 0.78 instead.<br><br>Hence the danger of treating "on paper" arguments as gospel truth. At one juncture the Israelis were forced to fight Arab armour with inferior FCS (no night sight), but they still managed to make a more then favourable account of themselves, and puzzling the Soviet and Arabs who knew that "on paper" their armour was in every respect superior.<br><br>Once again the human factor is the hard part of the equation, and technology can only take you so far.

The T-72 is more of a AK-74 of tanks, if one were to draw such an picture.<br><br>The main advantage of soviet designs is their low weight and cost, you could get about 3-4 soviet styled designs for one western tank.<br><br>But unfortunately in pratice the low silhouette and size had not proven to be a real asset in battle, FCS has simply improved to the point that reducing the size of the tank does not relate to any real chance of the enemy missing.<br><br>And they made great sacrifices just to trade off size, drasically reduced internal space and poor damage control abilities.<br><br>Being small may be beautiful in an AFV, but I think for modern MBTs are currently an exception to this rule... if you want to survive at least.<br><br>At the end of the day if you want to talk numbers the T-72 may be able to fit into smaller areas then a Leo 2, but it's ground pressure is actually higher and mobility less. So once again that's a tradeoff.<br><br>The soviet-styled design like T-72 is a great if you are facing lesser AFVs and infantry, but not really a tank you want to be fighting another tank or dedicated AT weapons in.<br><br>And of course if you look at the Type 99, which is the most advanced Chinese MBT yet, it shows that they have elected to put some western thinking into their design.<br><br>Not saying the western approach to tank design is the best, but I think as a whole they have a sounder approach towards making MBTs- putting the focus on protection and crew survival and confort as opposed to making the tank as small as possible- on a piecemeal evaluation at least. I mean it's another story if you can send thousands of inferior designs to swarm your enemy, in which case you are willing to sacrifice your tankers.</div>
