It is hard to totally destroy an M1 unless you use a huge IED or really heavy ATGM or something in the lines of it.<br><br>What's so strange abour RPGs being able to disable an M1? RPGs have knocked out Abrams before, just that it's hard to make that lucky shot without getting killed in the process. Also there are plenty of areas to put an RPG to in an M1 tank, but of course the smart tanker will keep his strongest side facing you have having his buddies to protect his weaker areas. Tatics matter as much as armour protection.<br><br>In the First Gulf War an M1A1 took a belly shot from an RPG while climbing a sand berm, and was disabled, so the iron ogres are not invincible, just extremely hard to kill.<br><br>The big 5, aka. the Abrams, Leopard 2, Challanger, Merkava and LeClerc are still the five MBTs you do not want to fight in war, but that does not mean they are unkillable.<br><br>In any case, the Abrams that got knocked out by an RPG that I mentioned can be found here, it was interesting because at first they could not figure out what was the projectile that disabled the tank, but later they realized it was just a very lucky shot from an RPG 7.<br><br><a href="http://www.discourse.net/archives/2003/11/what_puts_holes_in_abrams_m1a1_tanks.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.discourse.net/archives/2003/11/what_puts_holes_in_abrams_m1a1_tanks.html</a><br><br>Anyway the hull armour of MBTs tend to be a lot weaker then their turret armour, especially the flanks. The turret side of the M1 is supposedly able to resist it's own DU APFSDS rounds (which they realized when they tried to destroy a bogged down M1A1 tank)!<br><br>But not the hull, where a hit will produce a through and through penetration... and this is probably true for other MBTs as well.<br><br>From the front the M1 is quite nearly invulnerable to just about anything, save a LOSAT or some really huge AT weapon prehaps?<br><br>In any case, if there's any tank you want to go into battle with right now, you can be sure it must be one of the top 5... anything else might be suicide.</div>

There were firing tests of Panzerfaust 3 armed with 3T and improved 3-T600 tandem HEAT warheads (Dynamit Nobel claims that 3T is capable of piercing 900mm RHA behind ERA and 3-T600 over 1000mm RHA behind ERA at the hitting angle of 90 degrees). On Polish testing ground 3T was fired upon armoured steel plates of 550mm RHA screened with Erawa-2 at the hitting angle of 30 degrees and 3T-600 was fired at the similar target at hitting angle of 15 degrees. In both situations German warheads pierced through Erawa-2 but then were capable of penetrating only about 400mm of RHA. Germans were surprised by the protecting level gave by Erawa-2.Â”</blockquote></span><br><br><blockquote>At normal circumtances, LAW gunner should not even try to engage PT-91M at the front, but senario I have given was for evasive measure when they are being hunted down by them.<br><br>Try to hit the first one and take evasive action as I suggested. </blockquote>nice senario.<br><br><blockquote>It depend on the technology of the ATGM.<br><br>For example, Spike could still be operate w/o optical link but by thermal imaging( i.e. no wire needd in this case), a true 3rd generation F&amp;F ATGM, unlike that of 2nd gen SACLOS like BHAKTAR SHIKAN , METIS -M etc.<br><br>In fact, top attack ATGM is even better than 2nd gen direct fire ATGM, reason is becos one could guide the missile way above the canopy where the 2nd gen direct fire ATGM could not do , thus better in reducing the possibility of entanglement of the wire by the vegetation.<br><br>LAHAT and Hellfire II are both laser guided, (for Hellfire II there us also a version which is MW guided), so no problem at all. </blockquote>try to use that knowledge and fire a lahat here...<br><br><img src="http://aa.wrs.yahoo.com/_ylt=A9FJqF_xzidGRJsAmBnuPwx./SIG=136i5ad92/EXP=1177100401/**http%3A//www.horizonsunlimited.com/tstories/rooiman/images/malaysia/20020524-008.jpg"><br><img src="http://www.inhu.go.id/image/potensi/karet.jpg"><br><img src="http://www.csf.or.id/gallery2/main.php?g2_view=core.DownloadItem&amp;g2_itemId=200&amp;g2_serialNumber=2"><br><br>bare in mind a top attack atgm must go where first? before hitting the target?<br><br><blockquote><br>Who say so???<br><br>ST Engg is adverising them in their website, so it is certainly not illegal.<br><br>There is talk in Europe to ban the use of cluster munitions or bomblets but so far nothing is concrete.<br><br>In fact the likely outcome I think will be banning cluster munitions w/o self-neutralising or self-destruct capability, which is STK cluster munitions ceratinly have such capability, so it will not be illegal in the future. </blockquote>You will eat your word when you saw what cluster munition did to children in lebanon.
