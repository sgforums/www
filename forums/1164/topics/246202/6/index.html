Of course I am assuming they had some common sense.<br><br>I mean if the PT-91 (or any of its variants) was really superior to any western tank on the market, I don't know about the Poles but it's one tank that I would like to hang onto instead of trading it out so that I can operate easily with some other armies.<br><br>Basically no matter how you spin it, the T-72 has several serious drawbacks that cannot be overcome without radically changing the tank itself (in which case you might as well get a totally new design).<br><br>The main one being that of inadequate internal space and very poor damage control. The basic design of the T-72, no matter how you tweak it renders it to be an MBT that you do not want to be in if its penetrated. And one can only improve it so much but this flaw will always be an issue.<br><br>Also, the elevation of the gun presents tatical issues (the tank is unable to run up against a protective berm and depress its gun to bear or keep its gun in the fight if it's climbing a hump) as opposed to western designs. I'm not sure how fast the new electric turret goes but I wonder if it's up to par with western systems. Russian tanks have been known for their low turret traverse rates. But that's just speculation on my part.<br><br>Having a good Fire Control System is no good if your gun can't be brought to bear on the target or turret turn fast enough to keep up with the FCS computer.<br><br>The armour protection is another issue as well. I don't think the makers of the PT-91M ever intended it to stand up against MBT fire from other tanks, but tailored it more of infantry level ATGMs or LAWs. There is only so much armour you can pack into a 40+ ton tank and to provide reliable protection in MBT engagements you need to tot packages like the DU package like that of the M1A1 HA series.<br><br>So ERA aside, unless the poles really came up with something as revolutionary in passive protection that allows a 40+ ton tank to pack as much protection as your typical 50-60 ton MBT, I suspect the term "new composite armour" to be more of a buzzword then anything else.<br><br>All that aside I'm not saying the PT-91M is a lously tank, just that I suspect some people might not know which end of the gun the APFSDS comes out from when they say that the Leo2A4 is "no threat" to it. That smacks of the "on paper" argument... which is the habit of quoting paper facts without using common sense and logic to consider how it all really stacks up.<br><br>At the end of the day, there's only so much you can do with a 40+ ton soviet tank design with limited internal space and damage control measures.<br></div>

It is FCS of latest generation. Leopard 2A4 has FCS of previous generation, from 80`. FCS of PT-91M has not only longer range and higher precision of detection and targeting of objects in any conditions but also "hunter-killer" capabilities with additional autotracking function. All electric turret has new, latest generation stabilisation system of gun and new, improved gun with 20% better accuracy. New 125 mm APFSDS rounds of Polish, Ukrainian, Pakistani,Chinese etc. production have penetration of 560-600-640 or even 760 mm RHA at 2.000m, which is enough to knock out Leopard 2A4.<br>So maybe not absolutely, but most probably, in possible duel between PT-91M and Leopard 2A4, Leopard should be simply first detected, identificated, targeted and destroyed by PT-91M. Especially in medium and long distance and bad weather conditions. From the other side, in close quarter day battle, chances should be equal, with Leopard advantage in armour and mobility.<br>There are different tanks with different capabilities, it is very hard to mesure precisely which tank is "better" in most situations and conditions. So it is wrong way of discussion, once again, I only asked you: dont underestimate PT-91M.</div>

It simply means that it's design lineage can be traced back to where it started from.<br><br>Of course, FCS aside, you seem to leave out the very important ability of the tank to keep up with it's FCS. That is a whole different thing entirely.<br><br>20 percent more precise? What do you mean? In terms of MOA or ability to lay the gun? Proper numbers please.<br><br><blockquote>New 125 mm APFSDS rounds of Polish, Ukrainian, Pakistani,Chinese etc. production have penetration of 560-600-640 or <strong>even 760 mm RHA</strong> at 2.000m, which is enough to knock out Leopard 2A4.</blockquote>Not that I want to doubt you but this smells like snake oil. 760mm RHA is more akin to the "silver bullet" APFSDS that the yanks use (currently rated to 790-800+mm RHA)and I'm not sure if you got this number off a website trying to make a sales pitch or did they really put holes with it? In any case,<br><br>And on armour penetration of the "new" APFSDS rounds, I am dubious not because I want to defend the Leo2, but because even the numbers you state are dubious. The first generation of Leo2 tanks had an approximate KE protection of 650mm RHA, and the armour was further improved against KE attack in the A4 variant with tungsten and titanium, putting it somewhat in the league with the M1A1 HA series of tanks (which is prehaps the most KE protected tank in the world). KE protection for A5 and A6 with the spaced armour wedge is even higher.<br><br>Hence along the frontal arc, I express my doubts that anything less then the american "silver bullet" APFSDS will do the job on a Leo 2,<br><br>Unfortunately I do not have the specific RHA numbers to prove it, but we can draw some ideas on the level of protection from examples on tanks with similar protection in both Gulf Wars. When the Yanks attempted to destroy their own M1A1s that had bogged down in the mud, they realized to their surprise that their "silver bullet" APFSDS had difficulty penetrating their own turret armour even at point blank range.<br><br>I'm not trying to put down the PT-91M, but a lot of the stuff you mention smells a lot like snake oil... of course we can't know until you try to put holes in each other.<br><br>Also, in the terrain of SEA, do you seriously think MBTs have the chance to engage each other at long or even medium range? Taken a trip to our parts before? Most MBT battles will likely be concluded below 1 km, we just don't have the rolling plains of tank country here.</div>

The ceramic materials also were added to chassis/hul.

            <div class='col-md body'>And how does 20 percent more precise (assuming it's true and not snake oil) even matter given what MBTs were capable of doing even in 1991? They could put rounds into targets 3 feet tall 2 clicks away on the move?<br><br>The ability of the electronic FCS has long since outgrown the capabilities of the conventional gun system, even if your gun was 20 percent more precise (whatever that means), it would not actually factor into a 20 percent increase in capability, not any more then a 2000lb LGB with a 20 percent lower CEP then another one is actually more useful... the "inferior" system is more then enough to splatter anything even with it's larger CEP.<br><br>This logic was discovered by the soviets who went to extreme lengths to make their tanks smaller, reducing its form factor and drastically removing internal space only to realize that FCS systems had simply grown so capable that the smaller size did not represent a useful asset in helping their enemy miss. And of course they sacrificed armour protection and a lot of other things to get there.<br><br>So unless you intend to shoot coconuts with the PT-91 "more advanced" gun at 3 clicks, I'm not sure it's a real horn to toot. Even at 2 clicks a less precise weapon will do the job just as well.<br><br>It would only matter if you could somehow engage your enemy at ranges far beyond what is normally possible, then lets start to talk about how precise your gun is.<br><br>Of course, we are also told to make the leap of faith that 2A46MS gun is better then any smoothboreRheinmetall can manufacture... have they actually run a gunnery contest like they usually do in NATO or is this yet again snake oil?<br><br>Please refer to a thread in Strategypage on some dudes who tried to insist (rahter dubiously as well) that the Zulfiqar MBT and the Type 96 are better then any of the "big 5" MBTs (Leo, Abrams, Challanger, Merky and LecClerc), needless to say many were HIGHLY dubious.<br><br>As one tanker put it "if you have some dude who claims any new-fanged design is better then the big 5, it's time to take him with a large pinch of salt)</div>

I bet you my head no one will know it, at least for now.</div></blockquote>No one will know, but it's possible to make some educated guesses:<br><br>For example, APFSDS technology is reaching it's apex, that's why they have been suggesting alternatives to suceed it for some time now (ETC guns, larger calibers). There's a pratical limit to how much armour you can penetrate with a conventional APFSDS round from a gun of 120-125mm caliber.<br><br>One limit is in the propellant, as chemical propellants have a limit as to how much bang they can produce (which has a pratical limit before it destroys the gun). But a greater limit lies in the penetrator itself.<br><br>The design of the penetrator is prehaps the most important. The ratio of diameter to length, the type of material we make it out of and what have you not. Get the wrong length ratio and penetration will be inefficent. Get the material wrong and the penetrator might shatter and be ineffective.<br><br>The problem with current APFSDS technology is that we are already reaching the very limits of what we can do with it from a 120-125mm platform. To get good penetration you need a very slim and long penetrator (high diameter to length ratio), but such a penetrator is only possible with exotic materials, and hence each round will cost a lot more. And this can only carry you so far.<br><br>The yanks have some of the most effective APFSDS ammunition around, given they are the ones who are willing to spend a couple of grand with a single pull of the trigger and also the ones willing to use exotic materials like DU in their penetrators. And they are well aware of the limits of this technology. What we do know is that the frontal arc KE protection of their M1A1 HA (and onwards) series actually provide more protection then could be overcome by the pratical limits of APFSDS technology, that's why they worked on systems like LOSAT and the like to come up with new ways of defeating such KE packages, but nobody really followed up with it on their MBTs.<br><br>In fact their next generation tube-launched KE technology is based on rocket assisted projectiles (more akin to LOSAT then conventional ballistic technology), they have reached the limit of what is possible with APFSDS technology just as how the limit with HVAP was reached before APFSDS was introduced.<br><br>So back to the PT-91 APFSDS, this means that we can exclude the more fantastic numbers as pure fantasy and an attempt by the salesman to sell the round rather then actual reality, and the higher numbers as greatly suspect (unless the Malaysians are happy to buy their rounds at very expensive prices and deal with heavy metal toxicology issues), and focus on the more likely and lower estimates instead.<br><br>I would treat "even 760mm RHA" as highly suspect, and see the lower numbers as more likely. Prehaps 450-650mm RHA is more in the ballpark.</div>

But follow up on the spot where the previous round impacted? I think not.<br><br>The limits of APFSDS technology are quite well understood, hence indeed one should take fantastic numbers on "Pakistani penetrators" coming from excited people with a big pinch of salt. I might trust the China stuff more (as much as they tend to have the hype effect), but I think it's a moot point...<br><br>We won't know if it can penetrate the Leo 2 until it is actually tested in combat, but I suspect our KE package might be up to the task (if it can be benchmarked to the M1A1 HA standard), given improved KE protection was the idea of the A4 variant, taken one step further in the A5 "wedge".<br><br>But of course this is speculation on my part, just as the guy who threw highly speculative values on the "multiple country manufactured" 125mm APFSDS, just that I need to point out that I do have some real world combat examples to draw from when the Yanks had difficulty in penetrating their own armour point blank with prehaps the most effective APFSDS in use anywhere ever.<br><br>If APFSDS technology wasn't reaching it's useful limit in 120-125mm caliber, why do you think people are messing around with ETC and 140mm platforms? As well as "rocket rods"?<br><br>Also it seems to me the upgraded armour package in the PT-91M was tailored to HEAT and not KE attack, so it's a different ball game entirely. To defend against KE you need the heavier packages with exotic metals in it typically found in the heavier MBT designs. There's only so much you can pack into a 40+ ton design.<br><br>In fact if the lighter ERA is to be believed, it seems the PT-91M has focused on HEAT attack, and not KE threats. Which makes sense given there is no real pratical way they can proof the tank from KE attack (only tanks in the higher weight range have a realistic chance of turning off KE attack with their packages) and focusing more of the threats they can deal with- which is infantry LAWs and ATGMs.</div>
