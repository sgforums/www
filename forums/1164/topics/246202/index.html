            <div class='col-md body'>If you guys want to know more , read the comment by Polish tank commander posted by Xerovix in the new MN forum , which was orginally from this thread in Militaryphoto forum which orginally from a Polish forum:<br><br><blockquote><br>Question:<br>How can you compare the armour of Leo-2A4, PT-91 and T-72M1<br><br>Answer:<br>It's not really comparable. I was talking with a friend who was taking part in shootings to an armour covered with ERAWA (polish reactive armour. It didn't stand any chance against APFSDS, against HEAT it was much better. I had a couple of pics from the German shooting range, after the shooting a T-72. It's funny but in Germany you're not allowed to use combat APFSDS because of it's range, so they used some training APFSDS. The tank was shoot apart no matter on the place of hit/impact. The shape of the tank has completely no<br>meaning so there's no ricochetting (spell?) about which I was taught as a tanker for years, in the most round places the shelles went throught the tank (in and out).<br><br>Question Leo2A4 has a better power to weight ratio, how does it look in practice?<br><br>Answer<br>Also uncomparable. Acceleration, breaking, mobility on the pitholed road in hard terrain are couple of times better than ours "t" series tanks. Two examples. In 2002 we used ours WZT2 based on PT-91 underpinnings. We had the same training ground as the Leos and the Wzt which is lighter because it has no turret was far behind the Leos. It was possible to go faster because it was enough power but the suspension gave up. The second I was driving a Leo in a light terrain (sandy) 65km/h.<br><br>Question:<br>How can you compare the accuracy of Leo-2A4 to PT-91 and T-72M1?<br><br>Answer:<br><br>There's no need to talk about T-72. As for PT-91 it had something called by the producer "floating/wandering (?) point of impact". Someone want to ask more about accuracy? Leo with a good trained crew can destroy a target that appeard in his sector in 14-16 seconds. No PT-91 or T-72 could do that, maybe by a chance.<br><br>Question:<br>Can you compare the ammunition of Leo-2A4 to the PT-91/T-71M1?<br><br>Answer:<br><br>The basic purpose of a tank is a fight against other tank and this is what the APFSDS is the best for. The APFSDS of the T-72 is restricted in lenght so it's restricted in armour penetration (two-parts ammo). Leo doesn't have such problems. The PT ammo has better velocity but it's not as effective. The plus for the PT is the HE round. We didn't recieved the HE rounds yet for the Leo.<br><br>Question:<br>Couple of questions regarding the FCS<br><br>- minimum and maximum range that are automaticly entered<br>- max. speed of the target<br>- max. perpendicular wind speed<br>- time of recalculating correction<br>- air temperature<br><br>Answer:<br>- range is 200-9990m (above 4000 fire is blocked)<br>- it depends of the turret angle speed and target range (possible to hit a target running at 65km/h)<br>- realtime (for me unnoticable)<br>- air temp is entered manually<br>- windspeed is entered manually, the maximum value I was entering was 15 m/s more is not needed but I can check it.<br><br>Question:<br><br>How the practical rate of fire looks like compared to T-72 autoloader. Is live loader faster? And is he an advantage or disadvantage.<br><br>Answer<br>In theory the PT-91 auto is faster. Good manual loader makes 4 rounds in 20 sec. Autoloader is very unreliable. It has the ability to jam and than the fight with an "alien" begins.<br><br>Question:<br>How often do you use laser rangefinder. Is it useful in times when more and more tanks has systems similar to OBRA (automatic smoke grenade launcher when laser detected)?<br><br>Answer:<br>We use it always before the fire. And as for OBRA it's not useful as in the very second the shell is on it's way. OBRA is more useful against other sources lighetning the target. In modern battlefield there will be so many laser beams OBRA can fool the crew and FCS itself.</blockquote><a href="http://www.militaryphotos.net/forums/showthread.php?t=86408&amp;page=4" rel="nofollow">http://www.militaryphotos.net/forums/showthread.php?t=86408&amp;page=4</a></div>

Think about whether we can even counter them not "chey they cmi".<br><br>Oh yeah please dont tell me you see this you will zhao. If you are in defense position how?  Think also. If you zhao you will probably be mged down in the back too and demoralise all your buddies next to you.  So look where you can shoot and have a chance.<br><br>I know i talk bullcrap but i mean well!<br><br>I'm still thinking for my own situation. Headache ah.<br><br></div></blockquote>Er... Matador? You use a Spike for this tank.</div>

The only area I can think of is hitting the engine (which is difficult), or the tracks (just as difficult.)<br><br>No, you get people armed with Spike to fight a tank like this. YOu don't fight it with Matador. You hide and just maybe strike the tracks or something.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>if really no choice, just shoot off ur matador at the tank, then run off into the bushes and try to hide and report to higher HQ so that they can take care of the problem. at least you have a lighter load.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>i doubt this tank will do much mad rush towards defensive position, MAF tank doctrine were mostly ambush, but that doesnt meant it wont happen. If the commander saw the opportunity he would be happy to use it for counterattack.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>There's no way a MATADOR can take this out from the front, especially with the ERA covering it. Even a Spike might be of questionable effect on it.<br><br>Best shot? Switch your MATADOR to bunker busting mode and aim for the tracks, or go for a flank or rear shot in the none ERA parts with the HEAT mode. Unless you are a brain surgeon with the LAW, I doubt you can hurt it much.<br><br>In any case if you have nothing to counter it and it's coming at you, to stick around would be sucide... as it has always been with infantry vs. tanks.</div>
