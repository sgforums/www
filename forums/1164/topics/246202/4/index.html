HOWEVER any MBT itself can't possibly squeeze into dense jungle without requiring some kind of clearing or the like and that's where you will want to engage them anyway.<br><br>In fact an MBT in dense jungle is pretty useless, given it can't even bring it's gun to bear without getting trapped. So I think it's a moot point... if you see an MBT chances are you are already in a good spot to try for a top attack ATGM.<br><br>That aside, different tools for different jobs. Top attack can't be used in all of the cases, but it's another thing to say that our terrain prevents any kind of its use at all.<br><br><blockquote>yes but astros have effect a bigger area </blockquote>Once again different tools for different jobs. While rockets are great for sending a huge amount of explosives to the target in as short an amount of time as possible, tube arty will eventually send more weight of HE over time, and with it being more precise as well, a reason why tube arty still has its place. The logistics for tube arty is a lot easier to work out, as well as less vulnerable to distruption.<br><br>At the end of the day it's how you fight. Obviously having ASTROS suits the Malaysian needs, given they know they can't really go toe-to-toe with SAF tube arty and the ASTROS is a good way of getting more explosives into the arty fight- even if it's in not a very precise way.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote>ok. so how to achieve 60 deg and 75 deg hit during combat? and also how to achieve 90 or 0 deg hit too? im interested. thanks </blockquote>It depends on many factors, the difference in elevation between you and the target, the way the target is facing you, the properties of your rounds and many other things that affect the way your munition hits the armour.<br><br>Obviously the optimal way to splash your target is to achieve a 90 deg hit with your warhead, but given that tank armour is sloped this is not often possible. If you fire straight on at a PT-91M's frontal hull armour (assuming the tank is flat and level with you as well), you will probably achieve much shallower angles of hit.<br><br>There is a reason why armour is sloped.<br><br>On the other hand, if you are splashing the tank from an elevated position, your warhead is going to hit closer to 90 degrees, and hence the penetration power will be increased.<br><br>But the best is to go for the hull sides and turret, where the armour has virtually no slope at all, not to mention the armoured hide there is thinner as well. In any case it's foolhardly to directly engage an MBT in the frontal arc, given that's the most likely arc the tank can return immediate fire when you engage it.<br><br>Flanking it and catching it in the side works better.<br><br><blockquote>its still hounting me seeing small kids without limb playing football in cambodia, and it even hurt me that some of the mines were made by singapore. </blockquote>Might as well say that the VT shootings making us feel guilty about having invented guns at all.<br><br>At the end of the day the weapon is just a weapon, how people use it is another thing altogether. In the end, a tool is just a tool. Want somebody to blame? Blame the dudes who decide to plant mines with reckless disregard for just about everybody else and the future.<br><br><blockquote>its an area effect weapon. what do you think will happen if a battery of Astross send a salvoes on top of a forward hq? </blockquote>\<br><br>Depends on the range, the huge CEP of rocket arty makes it useful for sending a lot of explosives in a very short time into a large area, however the actual mass of exposives it can send per unit area over distance is a lot less then tube arty.<br><br>So while the forward HQ may take several hits, if they have been dug in properly they will most likely survive... unless the enemy is like the Yanks who can really toss plenty of rockets at you with impunity without the real need to shoot and scoot given they had already established superiority over their hapless enemy.<br><br>I doubt the Malaysians will see the same situtation with their ASTROS, if the SAF's counter battery and RSAF does its job properly.<br><br>MLRS is great for catching large masses of targets out in the open with minimal protection given its saturation effect, however it is a lot less useful when trying root out a properly dug in enemy force, in which tube arty, with its ability to consistently send HE to a smaller CEP would be far more useful.<br><br>This is also very important in urban battles, where the landscape can provide plenty of cover from saturation attacks. It would simply take too many rockets to root out a properly established and dug in forward HQ at distance, not to mention a lot of the destruction would be wasted on nothing.<br><br>In which case tube arty is a lot more useful at sending your enemy packing.<br><br>Once again, different tools for different jobs. MLRS is great for sending stuff to an enemy that is advancing on you and lacks proper cover, this is when the ability of the rocket arty to saturate an area with explosives works the best.<br><br>But properly dug in an harderned targets require more then the MLRS grid square removal effect, you got to send HE into a small CEP over a period of time.<br><br></div>

Their one hit can cause a world of hurt if not prepare.  Thankfully our friends north, only got a few of these weapons. </div></blockquote>Please read thru thr thread, the debate was not on cluster munition but the delivery system, tube arty with much better CEP will delivered the cluster munition much more efffectively against the target as compare to unguided rocket of MLRS system.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Sorry if I may have misunderstood the point.<br><br>For an MLRS, no one really wants a tight CEP, and especially so with cluster munitions. MLRS is best suited for Area Denial.  You have enough of those, you can blanket an area full of a mixture of cluster munitions, some with delayed fuses even.<br><br>Such a weapon, properly used, manned by skilled operators, with proper doctrine, can slow an advance force down and regain the initiative.  Its advantage is its wide area.  Look at the CEP comparison of trajectory guided rockets vs unguided.  Give each of those a blue dot of 300m munitions footprint, and see how much coverage u have.<br><br>Just cos a buckshot from a shotgun cant make a tight group against a .22 rifle, doesn't mean the shotgun/buckshot ain't good.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hello all!<br><br>Gary1910, I think you understand ERAWA-2 tests with Panzerfaust-3 in wrong way. Angles of 15o and 30o are very close to average hit angles of hull and turret of tanks from T-72 family. So these tests results show real penetration of Panzerfaust-3 after ERAWA-2 and Panzerfaust-3 cannot pierce turret of PT-91 covered by ERAWA-2. But please dont mix PT-91 with PT-91M. Details of PT-91M armour are clasified but one thing is known, PT-91M has <strong>new</strong> armour of hull and turret, much possibly with ceramcs and probably much more potent. It has also new, improved and lighter (due to aluminium boxes) version of ERAWA-2. You cited comments of some Polish tanker, but please pay attention that he compared our Leopard 2A4 with PT-91. PT-91M is different tank that PT-91. In my opinion PT-91M is more capable than Leopard 2A4, mainly because of:<br>- SAVAN-15 FCS which has capabilities only marginally lower that Leclerc FCS,<br>- new gun stabilisation system,<br>- all electric turret,<br>- new gun with accuracy 20% better than basic 2A46.<br>Sorry but I think that your MATADORS and  your Leopards 2A4 (if not modernised) are no threat to Malaysian PT-91M. Even Spikes. We have also Spikes in Poland and know that this missile is not fully effective in short ranges and in wet conditions with fog, low level of clouds etc. In case of Singapore - urban and jungle conditions - your Spikes also could be not so effective like in theory.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>but there is one exception.<br><br>newer generation reactive armor such as ERAWA 2 are lighter in terms of weight and material, yet gives better protection from anti armor missile from its predessesor.
