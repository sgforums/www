For RPG-7 there are some new tandem warheads with 500 RHA (cover by ERA) but not sold to forces yet (manufacturer site - http://www.dezamet.com.pl/dezamet/plakat11b/plakat10.html ).<br>Of course, Russians have their new warheads for RPG. Especially specialist say that RPG-7VR was the version of weapon used againg this ABRAMS tank, that was penetrated of both sides (http://www.altair.com.pl/files/r1203_abrams.htm). So MoD guys organized with Germans the tests of PF-3T, they cowered steel with ERAWA-2, and it was shoot from several angles.  Germans claimed PF-3T to be able to penetrate 1000RHA behind ERA. After thest it appeared that half of it was achieved, 500 mm penetration in the steel. But there are also some mysteries with those tets - some of the bricks did not explode, yet it protected the steel. Anyway, Polish Land Forces did not buy the Panzerfausts, although this kind of weapon is very necessary - on west border we have Germans with amazing Leo2A6, Leo2A4, on easter border we have Belaruss and Russia, with thousands of T-80 and Poland cannot spent the same money as the Germans, and unfortunately does not have so weapon industry in very different areas. We have a peace now, but relations with Russia gets a little worse, and Germans now start to want some of their lands back. Who can images what can happen in 15 years. So effective grenade lauchers are very needed, especially with some programable amunition. As i read some military analyzis from polish land forces, they want to introduce a new kind of RPG successor with about 1000 meters range.</blockquote></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>The problem with Snipers is that the Comd has to stick his head out to look around.  Some angles are just not covered especially if you are talking about the area directly next to an armoured vehicle.<br><br>While RWS has solved this partially, cameras are still very limited with today's technology. Good Cameras can see 360  degrees, imagine a circle drawn.  Better ones can see in a sphere. However, the overdependence of cameras alone will result in a need to protect the cameras from damage.  Transparent material and strength are apparently two different hard to have together properties(expensive too).  Not to mention the amount of extensive wiring and controls require to cover the tank from bottom to top.<br><br>Basically, if you can see the tank on the outside, weapons from the enemy can hit you.  It's part of the risk of being a vehicle commander. I know cause i'm one. It absolutely sucks. I'm hoping that they will either allow RW of the 40/50/scout or convert them into something like the 25mm.  Suitable RWS that we can build will be like the Typhoon and mini-Typhoon. For those in doubt we can make that.... can PM me.<br><br>Anyway i'm waaaay off topic...since this is about MBTs first and foremost.  *cough*<br><br></div>

When was this?<br><br>Tanks with multiple turrets were in use since the period between the 2 world wars. The most famous multiple turret vehicle is the US M3 Lee. It had a added "wedding-cake" turret for the commander MG.<br><br>(In fact, the British left out the TC MG turret ion their version called the M3 Grant. The M3 was already a very tall vehicle without the extra turret and the turret is of limited usefulness.)<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by snowfox_my:</div><div class="quote_body">Originally posted by snowfox_my:[b]<br>Later, in the 70s-80s period, people laught and jeer at the Twin Turret idea,  Saying that it was not needed.

This is very advanced tank, much lighter than Leopard 2A6, Abrams A2, Challenger 2, Merkava 4 and Leclerc, but with [b]equal capabilities! </strong>CV 90120 has ACC active defense system of German IBD and Swedish Akers Krutbruk, first <strong>ADS system with claimed 100% effectivity with APFSDS rounds</strong>. CV90120-T also has:<br>- light 120mm/50 gun CTG of RUAG Land Systems, only slightly inferior to Rheinmetall 120/55 gun but better of older Rheinmetall 120/47,<br>- anti-radiation and anti-thermal absorbent paint, add-on multispectral camuflage suite,<br>- anti-thermal water mist/artificial fog system,<br>- very advanced FCS with 3 independent sights (loader has own sight)![/b]</blockquote>Apples and oranges, you are comparing the latest light tank convert of the CV90 with previous generation MBT designs. It would be better to compare it with the American FCS concepts or even the latest Korean K-2. After all the previous generation MBTs do not include signature-management systems and the latest in FCS developments.<br><br>And ADS with <strong>100 percent</strong> effectivity against APFSDS rounds? Sounds <span style="color: red;"><span class="large">highly suspicious</span></span>... who wants to be the first to bet their life on it? Sounds like some people are trying to confirm the dream of tank designers that they can rely totally on active defences and not worry about needing to mount any armour at all. Let's just say it's suspicious.<br><br>And of course when you come up against non conventional threats like insurgents with IEDs and simple, unguided RPGs... armour is still an asset that you can't find in a light tank. In the end the most bombproof and simple-AP weapon-proofAFV is still the MBT.<br><br>A light tank has it place and purpose, but I seriously doubt you can replace the 50 ton MBT with this "light tank" anytime soon.<br><br>And these "features" sound suspiciously like a sales pitch, as opposed to a pratical look at how things really play out on the ground.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>The reason why I find the claim of 100 percent effective against APFSDS suspicious is because so many parties have been working on an ADS solution for APFSDS rounds for quite some time now and indeed to make a 100 percent claim is a very tall order indeed.<br><br>The way I understand it, ADS solutions to APFDSDS rounds work by attempting to deflect or distrupt the round by projectiles, explosions or even projecting an ERA plate into it (even before the round impacts), causing the round to miss the target entirely or impact with greatly reduced force (up to 50 percent loss in penetration)<br><br>But even with 50 percent less energy, I doubt the light tank carries enough armour to prevent a penetration... and that is assuming the ADS managed to cause this effect in the first place!<br><br>So yeah, I am greatly interested... how does this ADS work?
