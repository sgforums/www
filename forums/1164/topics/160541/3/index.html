Just let me clarify why I believe Japan has not worried about deployability.<br><br>First of all, deployability in Japan itself is a war of defence of japan. History tells us that Japan never did have to defend the japan islands. The first ever attempt by a foreign forces to land in japan was the Mongolian in 1281. They never reached japan proper because of kamikaze. In WW2 the allied forces were spared the tasks of attacking japan thanks to the two atomic bombs.<br><br>Secondly, the seas that surrounded the Japanese islands are the natural barriers for any possible assaults on japan proper. The only land facing japan is Pusan in korea but the korea strait is a good 300km away. Japan completely wiped out the whole Russian navy in the battle of Tsushima, at the korea strait in 1901. China is a sea away from Japan, even to the ryuku island! The closest foreign island to japan is Sakhalin island of Russia, north of Hokkaido. If there is problem deploying troops on japan island, Sakhalin island is a nightmare.<br><br>Thirdly, who are the Japanese perceived invaders? (enemies who intend to occupy!), and who has the capabilities? China is far far away and has no capabilities, Korea is unlikely, Russia? A different story to me, need to study more.<br><br>In modern days, major threats to japan come from nuclear attack, directly from missiles or aircrafts, or indirectly through terrorism, and naval blockade. If they fail in these two fronts, where they deploy their ground troops is of no significance.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Before WW2 started, Japan had just won a war with Russia which the Japan Imperial Navy sank nearly the entire Russian Navy.<br><br>Not since the Mongolians had an Asian power defeat a Western Power. So Japan was feeling on top of the world, being the first Asian power.<br><br>After WW2, the world reverted back to Asia having no dominant power. Basically it's back to the old days with the European in charge.<br><br>China then became the next Asian military power.<br><br>Now China is a econmic powerhouse also.<br><br>China is now finding that it can also achieve a lot through a combination of economic and military muscle.<br><br>Its aggressive army of businessmen are already on the rampage buying up European, Canadian and American businesses including oil companies. It is also "colonising" the Indochinese countries by buying up their mineral mines, building factories. They are building factories in Vietnam - a former enemy - Cambodia, Burma etc.<br><br>The massive PLA stands as a force to kinda make sure things go smoothly. And it is also common for businessmen to cultivate relationships with PLA and government officials.<br><br>China is now apeshxt about the coming Olympics in 2008, being new kid in the WTO and the World Expo in 2010. So China will be very nice and do nothing to jeopardise its image.<br><br>For now it will tolerate all the nonsense of Chen Sui Bian and Koizumi. It will also not show too much force in the Spratlys. But make no mistake that China carries a very big stick and has shown its readiness to use it in the past.</div>

All the jobs will have to go to china because they are cheap and no less inefficient. Why do we have to re-learn our mandarin, unfortunately yes or our boss will send somebody to china.<br><br>So how? switch focus and imagine they are military threats in the future, on the basis that "how can you be sure that they won't"? build up your military arsenal in case a war starts? do we stand a chance? if china does intend on destabilizing any local government, they just do what the religious extremists do and plant bombs.
