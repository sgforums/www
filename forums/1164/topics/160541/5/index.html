Singapore has moved on. Today Singapore has an excellent relationship with Japan. Unlike South Korea &amp; China , Singapore is one of the few countries that supported Japan bid to be a permanent member in the UN.<br><br></div></blockquote>That's great - we have moved on.<br><br>How about the Japs? Have they moved on?<br><br>If Japan has moved on, how come Joizumi visits the shrine to pay respects to dead Jap war criminals every year?<br><br>The problem the Chinese have is that many Japanese today continue to deny that the Nanjing Massacre ever occurred. Some claim it was all fabrication. Some claim the numbers killed was just a few thousands. Also, they keep changing their school's history books every year so that maybe one day, they would be telling their children that they did no wrong in WW2.<br><br>How about you? Do you think the Nanjing Massacre was fake? How come no Jap politician will ever admit it occurred?<br><br>The Germans took all responsibilities for the Holocaust. Their politicians no longer pay respects to dead Nazi soldiers. They have truly moved on.<br><br>You don't understand the Japs - the Chinese and Koreans (North &amp; South) do. They have sufferred terribly for a very long time under the Japs.<br><br>You are way off in scolding the victims and siding with the wrong side.<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by Sid_Vicious:</div><div class="quote_body">Singapore is also one of the few countries in the world that have a Free Trade Agreement with Japan.<br><br>Japan has invested hundred of millions of dollars in the petrolchemical industry in S'pore and has created thousands of jobs in Singapore with their investment. China only take away our jobs.<br></div></blockquote>Which of your job did China take away? Do you know how many Singaporeans are working in China? Do you know how many Singaporean companies are in China? Do you know how much trade Singapore does with China?<br><br>You are really eager to bash China, but you got all your facts wrong, mate.<br><br>But no matter how much trading, investing etc, how come the Japs just can't accept and admit their past mistakes and - to quote you: "move on" like the Germans?<br><br>Why does Koizumi visit the shrine?<br><br>Think about it.<br></div>
