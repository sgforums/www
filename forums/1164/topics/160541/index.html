The JPG-1 AESA, especially, is a disappointment with faults that are still not corrected. The radar negating effect was never really solved, as was the faulty range due to software troubles. Currently, F-2's air-to-air tracking range against fighter-sized targets are rumored to be as low as 40km.<br><br>2). F-2 price is almost 6 times more expensive than F16C<br><br>3).

That has not changed since 100 yrs ago, but is it changing?<br><br>The geography of its land will never hampered the JDF for they never fought a battle on its land.<br><br>Japan's ability to build its armed forces is limited by the constitutions, not by its technological or financial capabilities.<br><br>Technologies will take yrs to built and financial capabilities take time to accumulate, but constitutions can be changed within a short period of time.

I can only hope that the leaders on any side would be cool and rational enough to know better ...<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Invading an island nation like Japan will not be easy. It would be more like D-Day or better yet, reference the battle of Okinawa.<br><br>Big budget stuff: full naval and amphibious force with massive air cover. And worst of all, very heavy casualty for the invading force.<br><br>There are many slightly different casualty figures you can find on the net for Okinawa, but they are all very high:<br><br><strong><span style="color: red;"><br>"US: 15,900 killed, 38,000 wounded + 26,000 non combat wounded , 763 planes shot down. JAPAN: 107,000+ soldiers killed, 10,755 surrendered/captured, 100,000+ civilians killed"<br><br>"The ferocious hand to hand fighting on Okinawa resulted in 12,281 Americans and 110,000 Japanese killed by June 21, 1945. The suicidal dedication of the Japanese defenders indicated an invasion of Japan itself would be costly, with estimates of at least 500,000 potential Allied casualties."<br><br>"Total American battle casualties were 49,151, of which 12,520 were killed or missing and 36,631 wounded... The cost of the battle to the Japanese was even higher than to the Americans. Approximately 110,000 of the enemy lost their lives in the attempt to hold "</span></strong><br><br>This is just Okinawa. There was a whole range of other islands the US had to take before Okinawa in WW2. Names like Leyte, Tarawa, Iwo Jima etc.<br><br>For US Marines and US Army troops in the Pacific, if they survived one island, they probably get to join in the fight for the next island. Whoopee.<br><br>One figure quoted 500,000 casualty if the mainland of Japan was invaded. This was WW2 and a very weak Japan in 1945.<br><br>So if someone were to mount an attack on Japan today, with today's modern weaponry involved, the casualty figure would number above a million surely.<br><br>China would be able to absorb a million in human casualties but it would not be able to absorb the loss in warships and combat aircraft. After such a huge amphibious undertaking, China would be very weak.</div>
