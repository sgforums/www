Japanese Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi appointed Monday a new cabinet whose key members gloss over the country's wartime past and espouse a tough policy line on its neighbours such as the two Koreas and China.<br><br>The cabinet reshuffle, which followed Koizumi's landslide election victory two months ago, came soon after the ruling Liberal Democratic Party endorsed a proposal to revise Japan's pacifist constitution, which would boost the status of the Self Defence Forces and give them a greater role and freedom in overseas operations.<br><br>The proposal also seeks the separation of state and religion, a move apparently aimed at facilitating government officials' visit to the Yasukuni Shrine, which honours Japan's war dead, including Class A criminals of World War II.<br><br>Taken together, these latest developments are a clear indication that the country is racing fast to the right, despite concerns raised by sensible Japanese and the international community.<br><br>A look at the profiles of just two of the new appointees is enough to convince one why the new Koizumi cabinet is a cause of grave concern. Foreign Minister Taro Aso and Chief Cabinet Secretary Shinzo Abe are both strong potential candidates to succeed Koizumi when he retires next September.<br><br>To begin with, the two conservatives back visits by Japanese leaders to Yasukuni, which is a symbol of Japan's militarism. Aso, who headed the Internal Affairs Ministry, was the only cabinet member to pay respects to the shrine in April. Abe also indicated upon his appointment that he would do the same.<br><br>We don't need to go any further than quoting Nobutaka Machimura, who was replaced by Aso, in questioning the sensibility of installing the two men in the cabinet. "If the prime minister, the chief cabinet secretary and the foreign minister all turn up to visit Yasukuni, it is feared it would lead to a quite serious situation," the outgoing minister said.<br><br>Adding to our worries is that Aso is one of the Japanese politicians who often glorify Tokyo's colonial rule of Korea. He argued in 2003 that Koreans were not forced by the colonialists to use Japanese names but did so willingly.<br><br>It is truly doubtful that Korea, China and other Asian countries who suffered so much at the hands of the brutal Japanese imperial colonialists can work with a man who is bent on glossing over his country's misdeeds.<br><br>On a broader perspective, the Republic of Korea (ROK) needs to work with its Asian neighbours, particularly China, to put a brake on Japan's expansionist policy, which is certain to pose a threat to regional stability.<br><br>In this vein, the upcoming summit between the ROK President Roh Moo-hyun and Chinese President Hu Jintao in Seoul ahead of the Asia-Pacific Economic Co-operation leaders' meeting would provide a good opportunity for the two countries to demonstrate their firm joint ground. For instance, they would be able to initiate international pressure on the wayward Japanese leaders not to visit Yasukuni.<br><br>The two leaders may do well to recall that their predecessors, Kim Young-sam and Jiang Zemin, at a summit in Seoul in 1995, joined in harsh denunciation of Japan's attempts to beautify its wartime atrocities.<br><br>Joint pressure coming from the ROK and China could be one of the ways to prevent Japan from creating the "quite serious situation" that its just-fired foreign minister worries about. Lining up other former victims of Japan's past expansionism in Asia behind such efforts would be more effective in curbing the country's ill-advised move in the wrong direction.<br><br>(China Daily 11/05/2005 page4)<br></div>
