Ship armour hasn't advanced much since I think the current doctrine is to destroy incoming warheads or avoid getting shot at in the first place. A ship is pretty much dead if a warhead explodes on the hull, much less get hit by a projectile that would blaze through the hull like water.<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by the Bear:</div><div class="quote_body">mach 5??<br><br>actual rail guns are supposed to shoot stuff which speed is measured in fractions of c or speed of light <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz"></div></blockquote>I can imagine the barrel wear and tear to be horrendous. At the moment, I think they can achieve something at least close to the escape velocity of the earth since one use of the gun would be to shoot and have it bounce off the atmosphere back down.</div>
