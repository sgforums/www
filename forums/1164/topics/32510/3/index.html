            <div class='col-md body'>True, but if the US is willing to sell us the F/A-22, of course some sensitive equipment is need to be ommited from the original design but if theres's a cooperation between ST Enginnering and Lockheed Martin about the F/A-22, they can produce F/A-22s for Singapore which is similar in performance and capability as the full variant...</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>THe F22 has been around for quite some time... And since Singapore is already in the JSF project... The US might just consider if we were to request to purchase the F22s<br>Yes there are lotsa sensitive equipment on board...<br>Since both the F16 and F22 are built by Lockheed, I doubt there will be major difficulties in fitting F16 avionics equipment onto the F22s since US is concerned abt the equipment part.<br><br>IF RSAF were to acquire raptors, RMAF's Hornets and Sukhois won't stand a chance.... Our Hawkeyes can detect their takeoff and alert our raptors which can take em out with AIM-120s before they become a threat to our planes. When the raptors return to rearm and refuel, our Vipers can deal with them too and the cycle can go on....<br><br>Just my personal opinion that's all.....</div>

Please kindly just paste the URL in the future. Anyway, this pix can be found at <a href="http://www.geocities.com/spyder355a/f16.html" rel="nofollow">The Unofficial RSAF Homepage</a> for those who are interested.<br><br>The picture was taken in the US when RSAF received its first Viper D Block 52 version. It was meant for publicity. It wasn't integrated with the Python 4 yet. Thus the pilots were not wearing a Dash-3 helmets albeit the helmets were black and look like a Dash-3.<br><br>Even the Vipers that first arrived in Singapore and displayed during the open house did not have the Dash-3/Python integration. It was only quite recently (from the last Pitch Black exercise) that I saw actually saw photos of Vipers with the Dash-3/Python4 integration, although none of them actually carry Python 4 to Australia for that exercise.<br><br>As for F-5S Tigers, I cannot confirm that they are already integrated with these but it should not be an issue if RSAF wants to do that.<br><br></div>

Last news i got about RSAF HMS was that Singapore Aerospace helping Venezuela to upgrade their F-5s with HMS.<br><br>About the F-22, I think we can dream very hard about getting it.  Cos we won't.  Those things costs like USD$100 Million.  Thats about almost 5 F-16s!<br><br>Moreover, considering the kinda congress the United States has and their restrictions on introducing new capabilities to our region, the chances of that is even slimmer.<br><br>The F/A-22 has capabilities now that none of us can even dream of.  Eg, some of the more well known ones like the ability to classify almost every known radar system in the world, and activate appropriate measures to counter them.  And that is just the tip of the iceberg.  Such a system will definitely not be released for Foreign Military Sales.  They won't trust us not to sell this technology or remake it.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>The Sh is nothing but BS and only Malaysia is stupid to even consider getting it. (Doubt Kuwait will get it). Once we purchase Rafale or Typhoon, your Su-30 is nothing to us.  Most Malaysians think with their MRCA, Singapore will be done for. But this is nothing but Malaysian BS. Threat? My foot.</div>
