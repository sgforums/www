To mi, i think this is a serious issue as no country here( not just sg) have this capability yet.  I dun see the SBug as a threat to mi.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Depends, thou all the trust vectoring in the world can't help you when you are trying to dodge AMRAAMS! That thing so far has a 100 percent kill rate on everything it was shot at, not a single AMRAAM has missed, even when used on aggressively manuvering and counter-measuring drones. That'll beat their Adders flat.<br><br>However it is no time to be complacent, though one factor we always try to remain is the quality of our pilots, and to make them as good as possible, following Israeli style. Only the best of the best make the breed in Singapore. Pilots make the battle. Just look at the way British Sea Harrier pilots fragged the enemy during the Flaklands, even though their plane could not preform as well.<br><br>We might be getting the Rafel thou... to replace the A-4s.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>What about the Typhoon? RSAF has stressed that the aircraft of the next purchase should be able to carry its present armamment. The Rafale is good but we will have to buy Magic and MICA AAMs.  Maverick ASMs, AMRAAMS and sidewinders might not fit and as we might be the first foreign customer of the type, we have to spent money integrating them onto the aircraft. The typhoon is able to carry our present armament and is designed to counter  Soviet Su-27 series fighters. BAe has also offered Meteor BVRAAM on the Typhoon package though these can be carried on the Rafale too. However the Typhoon looks to be delayed once again with the  crash.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>The Typhoon seems to be out to be out of the race liao... due the crash... wat.. the engine flame out??? do u know that there is nothing more a pilot can do if he encounters engine trouble for the typhoon.. It will drop like a comet, not like others which may be able to glide back to base. Note that they are replacing Strike crafts with the new planes... currently the idea of having F15s in the force seems more likely.<br><br>So what do you all want?

            <div class='col-md body'>and it was Dassault who first began its promotion to promote the <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Rafale</span> for the RSAF. Typhoon is also a good plane but as said by some of us, Eurofighter had been delaying the project due to budget and prototypes had crashed. It could be quite a while before Germany, Italy, Spain and Britain cpuld be supplied withe the Typhoons. Super Hornets may be out as Malaysia has acquired it and the F-15E is a deep strike aircraft, sure it retains its superior air-air capabilities, but as I heard, its wings may not be suitable for prolonged low-level flight. But then, F-15E is my choice...<br>The F-16 Block 60 is the newest F-16 block in the block and the UAE maybe the first to acquire it and if the agreement is sealed, it may be probably the first country to purchase something from the US which is as powerful as the US Air Force, something which was prohibited before. and there was the Rafale...its MICA is some mean missile and comes in two variants, radar-guided and heat-seeker and hear this, I heard it can carry cruise missiles...don't know if its true...</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>For the RMAF does not have many frontline plane (Mig 29 &amp; F/A18D) compare to singapore. But procuring planes in small numbers at a 5 years intervals does makes sense......especially when the planes reaching its lifetimes.<br><br>Look at south korea buying almost 40 F15 in one go....nowdays is very costly to replace on 1 to 1 basis.<br><br>In the near term the SU30 will be procure first. With this current situation the US is still to busy to approve the SuperBug to My....the F18F can wait a little longer. Next better money spend on AWACS, range equipments and some numbers of 90km+ russian "anti awacs" missile for the SU30!<br><br>Furthermore most country with Mig29 are retiring early this plane due to "quite" a number of reason....look around in web and magazines  u knows.<br><br>Even if RMAF managed not to trade the Mig29 with the SU30, the Mig is still good as 2nd line plane as with our current F5E. Infact I hope the My goverment introduce something in line like the national air guard using Mig29 &amp; F5E (part time pilot of course)<br><br>As for logistic.....what to do live with it la....!<br><br></div>

Besides the americans might block this toy and that toy and so you be left with a tooth-less tiger. The Rafale is begining to be my favourite. They can give those above us a hell of a time with APACHE/SCALP MISSILES.</div></blockquote>Yup F-15 might just stand a chance if we are offered JSOW, JDAM and SLAM-ER. However, With the Rafale we stand to get Scalp which has a much longer range than the SLAM_ER. And with a sea version who knows. It might also be fitted on the new Delta frigates too.

            <div class='col-md body'>Hmm, word is Rafel is cheaper, more modern (and hence easy to use and upgrade) and requires a smaller logistics chain.

            <div class='col-md body'>Reading back past posts, i found one written by tripwire saying that the late batch of RSAF F-16C/Ds have thrust vectoring nozzels.This is a surprise to me as currently the only planes in service that have this are the F/A-22, Su-30 and MIG-29. Already, the news of RSAF F-16D having the spine has got many around excited and RSAF is the second operator. If our F-16 do have such thrust vectoring nozzels, this news would have shaken the earth as we would be the first operator of F-16 to have such a thing. However, there is no nws around. One can identify such nozzels as they usually droop down while stationary. However, i have seen none that have this feature. Operators and would-be operators of improved F-16(Block 50+) including Greece, Chile, Poland etc do not have such nozzels on their planes and nether UAE's block 60 F-16, the most advanced variant have that. If we really have that, ours would be the most advanced F-16 currently around.</div>
