            <div class='col-md body'>Agree, but I seriously wonder how big a threat their RMAF really to justify such a tatic. By the looks of it, they face overwhelming air superiority from our forces. If we can't take their supply trucks out, we can still destroy them piecemeal in the air. And of course, with free reign over Malaysia save for annoying AAA and SAMs, we can pretty much chase their PM's fleeing BMW with LGBs, impacting them close enough to rattle, but not enough to kill them. That'll be the day...</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>How good is their MiG-29N? Some malaysian guy say their Migs were able to outrun USN F/A-18C/D in exercises(probably wet dreaming after reading how IDF/AF thrash USN in air exercises).</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Yes the MiG 29 is indeed faster then the F-18. About Mach 2.3 against Mach 1.8. Though it would be pretty useless in a dogfight as speeds only range from 250-450 knots. All in all, their preformance envelopes in terms of turning and manuverability are roughly the same. It's mainly up to the pilot.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hrm... Honestly... Mach 1.8 and 2.3 doesn't make that much of a difference.  Seriously.<br><br>The numbers itself may make it seem so.  But u have to also consider the amount of distance the planes have to fly at burners to reach that speed.  Usually, the higher mach number means that the acceleration is higher... but it still depends on the combat load and how much fuel it has.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Exactly, save for the F-22, no fighter plane can maintain supersonic flight for long before running out of fuel. Most of the action still takes place in the subsonic realm. In the entire vietnam war, all the US aircraft only logged about 20 minutes of supersonic time, combined!</div>
