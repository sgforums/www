            <div class='col-md body'>TVC is good! Even with all aspect missiles. Any pilot can tell you that.<br><br>In a closeup dogfight the US set up to study VIFF involving slow, lumbering Harriers vs. F-14s, the Harriers won an amazing 23 out of 25 engagements using VIFFing.<br><br>But of course, dun have to get all obessed about it. Dogfighting is here to stay, not all engagements can be blotted out at 30km with AMRAAMs and a lot of situtation will cause up to end up having to dogfight. In such a case, TVC will be an advantage.<br><br>As for the hemelt sights, you can hardly turn your head when pulling moderate Gs, getting the bandit in front of you is still a good thing.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>On G forces, I think in some cases, TVC actually reduce the need for high G manuvers. Doing J turns rather then high energy turns are far easier on the pilot, and far faster too. TVC gives you added nimbleness at any attitude or speed for sure.<br><br>I'm not sure what the SU-30's cobra is good for though, if that's the reson the malaysias bought it for. The manuver is only useful at targets above and infront and slowing down fast, but can only be preformed when the plane is light and not ladened with fuel or bombs.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hmm...for me, the Super Hornets can compliment the F-16s as it can swing its role for either Air Superiority or Attack, just like the F-16s, though it has more wing pylons (11, compared to the F-16's and F/A-18A-D's 9), which means more loads and electronics for the SH. The F-15 and the F-16 is a well-proven 'high-low' combination utilised by the USAF and with the F-15E, RSAF may have some resemblence to it. Rafale is somewhat like the same as the F-16, but can you imagine the load we can carry with 14 hardpoints!!! Whoa! Sure can beat the F-16...<br>The Su-30....the Russians has incoporated probably the best fighter to counter the Western planes, remember that in close range and in IR situations, SU-30 or its SU-27 counterparts and derivitives are superior, thanks to the IR Search and Track System, which is a tear-shaped 'zoom camera' to target its target for its IR missiles and its been fitted as well to the MiG-29..<br><br>Eurofighter Typhoon is also a good potential but there's this thing called budget problems and just recently, one of the prototypes crashed...it will even be quite a while b4 Britain, Germany, Spain and Italy received its first batch of the Typhoon<br><br>I not sure what to talk about for the F-16 Block 60, since the US has not even made any news of purchasing it...<br><br>As for the final 4 to be decided...we can only wait and see but for now, heres my final four...<br><br>1) Rafale<br>2) F/A-18E/F<br>3) F-15E<br>4) SU-30</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>read in the Flight International mag that the Typhoon has resumed flight testing. It seems that they have traced the engine flame-out problem to an earlier batch of the EJ200 engine (if I remembered correctly). Anyway, I think it would be foolish to rule out the Typhoon at this stage. If the Eurofighter consortium were to provide Singapore with access to sensitive equipment, or better yet, rope in Singapore as a partner in developing the tranche 3 aircraft, it may be too appealing to turn down their proposal. Remember, the RSAF has placed emphasis on technology transfer, rather than industrial offset. Imagine we get as much access as Great Britain, Germany on the AESA radar, etc.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Friend, having 14 hardpoints is a plus. If you were intercepted, you have no choice but to dump bomb lah (but drop on malaysia so also not so bad), however if you can carry less, you have to make more sorties to deliver the same amount of firepower, that means a higher change of getting shot down. In this case, more is certainly better.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Keep our airforce ahead with technological superiority and high level of intensive training.<br><br>A squadron of the Lockheed F/A-22 Raptors with Twenty First Century Technologies - that include stealth features - will be more then sufficient to handle a squadron or two of F/A-18F or Su-30MKM-A.<br><br>The FA-22 Raptor will allow our F-16 pilots and ground crew to switch easily into a new aircraft type, as both are from Lockheed.<br><br>This will be a natural progression, instead of mixing our aircraft fleet with different aircraft design and manufacturing philosophies.<br><br>At the last Asian Aerospace 2002, the displayed FX35 Joint Strke Fighter carried a Singapore flag - amongst a series of US and European Countries - on its tail. The Lockheed personnel clarified that Singapore had "bought itself a seat" as an interested party in the development of the JSF, but not necessarily as an Industrial Partner.<br><br>By 2020, when the FX35 JSF is ready for full production, the FA-22 Raptor would have reached its mid-life term; and the F-16's would have reached its optimum life.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Yes i agree that jettioning the bomb are an option ... but do consider that should the bombs be the Precision ones.... they are not cheap and they are NOT in numbers... losing them also a blow to us.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>More so would losing an entire aircraft to needless sorties that could be acomplished by an aicraft lugging more firepower! You can escort a strike aircraft but you can't avoid more sorties if you can't carry many bombs! That said, low carrying aircraft put more aircraft at risk. Not to mention longer logistics trail.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>its simplistic to think that the more hardpoints an aircraft has, the more it'll be used. fighter bombers don't go into battle with the mentality that once they are in danger they would unload. mission planning is a tedious process. the type of weapons to carry for the mission depends on the threats. an a-6 never went bombing carrying sidewinders for self defense cos they are CAP protecting them. same goes for the prowler. if a hardpoint is available, it does not mean that it has to be utilised. f-4s in vietnam did not use the centreline hardpoint for the fuel tanks when they venture north cos they use wing tanks. so do they put a bomb there to maximise weapon load when doing CAP? the type of weapons carried affects the aerodynamics of aircraft. if the mission requires alot of agility. the pilot would want to keep the load at the minimum. the su-27 pilots which crashed at the ukraine airshow last year complained that the plane was carrying extra fuel that affects its maneuverability. a su-27 pilot would managed his fuel load such that when he reaches the hot zone, he had fuel only in his central tanks and the wings tanks are empty to get maximum agility. lift vs drag, thrust vs weight.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Still it can be argued that more hardpoints provides more options, for sure. There will be times when you can go downtown armed to the teeth to blow nine shades of sharpnel out of everything in sight, (esp. In events of complete air superiority) and at that time, having more hardpoints simply provides far more options then skating around the sky thinking which is the best target to pop because you can only carry four slicks!<br><br>Nuff said. More hardpoints, more options.<br><br>That's of course not the only factor in how good the plane is, but having more hardpoints in the case of the Rafel is certainly a very good point.</div>
