"Red Cell" was purported to be a U.S. Navy SEAL team which had been organized to attempt to infiltrate and otherwise test the security of U.S. military bases and other installations sensitive to U.S. security interests. The original Red Cell group was led by the former leader of SEAL Team Six Richard Marcinko, a.k.a. the "Rogue Warrior".<br><br><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_Cell" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_Cell</a></div>
