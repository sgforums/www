            <div class='col-md body'>This is great news! As soldiers tend to travel more in B vehicles such as rovers and tonners, it is very crucial to properly protect this vehicles. Since our 5-tonners are relatively new and powerful thus there is room for heavier armour protection. Just a side note, there have been accidents with tonners before such as the one in ROC with reservists, i wonder if this additional armour will offer better protection to its occupants?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"></div>

I have seen one accident in Taiwan, and most of the injuries appeared to have been suffered when people were thrown around at the back. Of course the V-Com was stuck in front. I do not know the extent of his injuries but he did not seem terribly hurt. Assuming that the upgrade will do nothing to strengthen the poles holding up the canvas sheet, then the armor upgrade will have done nothing to protect the occupants behind.<br><br>In anycase, the taiwan tonners are different from those we use in singapore. I do not know if they have changed since when i was there though.<br></div>

The US soldiers are improvising armour on their vehicles at first which see great result.
