            <div class='col-md body'>hey guys, i would like to post an interesting question. i'm not sure if this has been asked in this thread, as it is so long. however, i would like to ask how the navy and coast guard did not stop the sampan from coming in. tekong is a military island, how is it that three robbers with only hand guns apparently managed to get through the radars and awacs of the SAF? tekong is also close to changi naval base, where american ships regularly dock, and also close to the sea lane for going into sembawang shipyard. this is also a major american warship route, as i've seen destryoers and even nuclear subs there. the USS cole was attacked by terrorists who drove up in small boats up to the big destroyer and blew a big hole in it.  how is it that security was so lax that the SAF couldn't protect its biggest military island and naval base from three indonesian badits with handguns? sounds like a major blunder to me. could anyone comment or correct me on this?</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>true, but it was reported they landed on the south side. i do not believe stuff like the sea is vast and sampan is small excuse. if they can't stop this, how can the police ever even think of stopping illigal immigrants? moreover this shows that many people could have gotten into singapore, even tekong without being detected. sampan small? coast guard radar is supposedly reported to be able to pick up humans swimming in the water even.<br><br>if this wasn't detected and stopped even before they landed, who knew, someone might have tried to take their sampan, drive it up to an american carrier undetected and unstopped, and blew something up? it doesn't speak very highly of SAF security when their major military island has been invaded by some badits....<br><br>have we not learnt from WW2 not to rely on others(esp you know who) to guard and defend us? as long as they landed in tekong means they entereed singapore waters already what...<br><br>i have a feeling someone high up is going to get screwed for this lapse<br><br></div>
