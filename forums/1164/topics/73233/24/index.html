In short, the SOF were given the orders to skip the ROE and got to rule 5 straight away. The only reason being that the spore govt had decided that these terrorists were bent on killing hostages if their demands were not met and thus no chance could be taken.<br><br>The hunt on Pulau Tekong did not involve any SOF units. 1 Guards unit was deployed along with 2 more other units. the only special force unit was from the police.<br>To the one who thinks that the the SAF is not vigilant enough, i have this to say. There is 16 km of sea between the nearest point of tekong and johor. And, the singapore has to respect the territorial boundaries between ourselves and m'sia. Its not easy to be searching through the jungles for 3 men. Yes we did have 400 plus men. But you must realise that 3 men vs 400, may seem easy but 3 men can move faster than the 400. Also, its not easy to hunt in pitch dark. Even though we may have NVG, still the SAF is not willing to risk any accidents. Yes we did carry out night ops but we had to stop at 3.<br>I cant reveal my unit. but trust my word. i had to stay in camp the entire period during the chase. i'm an nsf.</div>
