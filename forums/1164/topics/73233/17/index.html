            <div class='col-md body'>hi ppl... the picture in the papers is NOT of an NS unit. there are NS units involved but i'm not sure which ones.<br><br>the guys on this morn's papers ARE not from an NS unit. i know where they're from but so far the news hasn't mentioned them so i won't be saying who they are. but i can tell you that these guys are more ops ready then most of the battalions.<br><br>anyway...just to add a bit of snippets for you military crazy people, did you know that an OCS wing was involved? they happened to be on that island doing a POI exercise...haha...then when the news broke, they transferred from ex to ops...hahaha...<br><br>oh and.... m203? first of all, any standby unit/ unit who turns ops for this assignment, MUST have zeroed weapons. Keeping to the estab of a platoon, there are bound to be m203 gunners hence the need to bring their ZEROED m16s which happened to have m203s attached to them. otherwise, they're def not gonna draw any m203 rounds with maybe the exception of illum but i really doubt it. For those of you war mongers out there, i think you're gonna be very very disappointed.  I predict the outcome is likely to be the surrender of the two guys without a shot fired. besides, the guys searching are prob NOT even given the basic 1.5 contact rate. they're prob given really really limited amount of rounds... think about it, if each men is given 5 rounds, assuming there are 500 odd SAF troops(i'm guessin the police didn't change their figueres) that would translate to 500x5=2500 rounds for 3 jokers....but u never know...one thing is for sure, there's no way 1.5 contact rate was issued.<br><br>and for all those people thinking they'd bring in planes or apaches or even the artillery to bomb the shit out of them, i'm gonna really disappoint you by saying SAF IS NOT THAT STUPID. you think they'd really wanna reveal their strengths infront of the world?<br><br>one thing i'm really puzzled is why none of you worry about an actual invasion since all most of our standby units are involved. I was kinda worried when i heard my bud's unit was involved as his unit was on 6ntm...</div>
