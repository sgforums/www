Your immediate family member is in serious trouble for breaching the secrets act.<br><br>2.) The SAF is crazy enough to toss away valuable information on terrorist organizations just to send out a message.<br><br>3.)

Singapore likes to be known as a nation who has no regard for internationally accepted laws for behaviour in combat.<br><br>5.) More oddly, if our gar'men wanted to make an example out of them, they certainly didn't talk much about how we will shoot wounded and disarmed tangos in the toliet to show those terror organizations about what we can do, instead, the only peep we got of this was from a immediate family member of yours.<br><br>Hmm, but of course, we know what you say is not reality.<br><br>Yes, as credible as a certain commando who boasts of penetrating fictious missile bases in Bukit Batok and pasting malaysian stamps on the missiles there. </div></blockquote>i might not totally agree with ST here but i do have a few things in support. were there dead hostages? no. did singapore have to pay a ransom? no. were there dead SOFs? nope. so zero casualties and 100 percent dead hijackers. sounds pretty much like a succesful mission. besides...even if they were brought out alive, they'd prob be hanged by the court. so it makes no difference...</div>

For those that did not open their big eyes when they were doing BMT(for the mono guys who did theirs in their unit, you must have been to that island atleast ONCE), for all you civilians who think tekong is some little island with a sprawling city and mrt network, for all you people that think that this is a movie, <strong>TEKONG IS NOT SMALL. IT IS FILLED WITH SWAMPS AND DENSELY FORESTED. for 3 men to hide its extremely easy. and u think that ALL 700 people are involved in the direct search ops? NO!!! some of these people are involved in CORDONING off the area that has been searched. do i need to explain why there's a need to cordon off an area?</strong> for all those smart alecs who think THEY can do the job better, go ahead... we'll see what YOU do when you reach a swamp..you'd prob skirt it and glance to see if anyone's there. these guys actually have to WALK into the mud and all that crap, turn over every rock and check for them...<br><br>next..it DOESN'T matter who catches it. there was one dumb idiot who posted that there were more saf troops then gurks so it was sia suay that the saf troops did not find them. did it occur to you that it doesn't matter? you think you're gambling issit? the gurkhas with their better physical condition and abilities are prob called upon to lead the search, leavin the SAF soldiers to guard the areas that were ALREADY searched.<br><br>next, branzzz...really...how dumb do you want us to see you as? the m'sian coast guard couldn't chase into singapore waters right? so they'd prob lose sight of them at the northern part of tekong. being robbers, (and this proves they've got more brains then you) they'd prob escape to the nearest land form, TEKONG....would you then land on the northern part where the m'sian police can see you or would you skirt to the side of the island where the view is blocked? geez...<br><br>now i rem there was another joker sayin why not send the whole division to go in? haha... please... the SAF has other things to do apart from finding these 3 jokers. there is still the security of the nation to take care of and thats what the other units are doing.<br><br>really...i'm apalled at how some of you think</div>

For those that did not open their big eyes when they were doing BMT(for the mono guys who did theirs in their unit, you must have been to that island atleast ONCE), for all you civilians who think tekong is some little island with a sprawling city and mrt network, for all you people that think that this is a movie, [b]TEKONG IS NOT SMALL. IT IS FILLED WITH SWAMPS AND DENSELY FORESTED. for 3 men to hide its extremely easy. and u think that ALL 700 people are involved in the direct search ops? NO!!! some of these people are involved in CORDONING off the area that has been searched. do i need to explain why there's a need to cordon off an area?</strong> for all those smart alecs who think THEY can do the job better, go ahead... we'll see what YOU do when you reach a swamp..you'd prob skirt it and glance to see if anyone's there. these guys actually have to WALK into the mud and all that crap, turn over every rock and check for them...<br><br>next..it DOESN'T matter who catches it. there was one dumb idiot who posted that there were more saf troops then gurks so it was sia suay that the saf troops did not find them. did it occur to you that it doesn't matter? you think you're gambling issit? the gurkhas with their better physical condition and abilities are prob called upon to lead the search, leavin the SAF soldiers to guard the areas that were ALREADY searched.<br><br>next, branzzz...really...how dumb do you want us to see you as? the m'sian coast guard couldn't chase into singapore waters right? so they'd prob lose sight of them at the northern part of tekong. being robbers, (and this proves they've got more brains then you) they'd prob escape to the nearest land form, TEKONG....would you then land on the northern part where the m'sian police can see you or would you skirt to the side of the island where the view is blocked? geez...<br><br>now i rem there was another joker sayin why not send the whole division to go in? haha... please... the SAF has other things to do apart from finding these 3 jokers. there is still the security of the nation to take care of and thats what the other units are doing.<br><br>really...i'm apalled at how some of you think [/b]</blockquote>Wow, this dude sound so patriotic...</div>
