            <div class='col-md body'>NEARLY 700 soldiers and policemen are combing Pulau Tekong for three armed robbers who fled there from Johor yesterday morning.<br><br>The search is now focused on the northern part of the island with guardsmen, reconnaissance troops, the Special Operations Command and Gurkhas among the crack units deployed, along with 12 search dogs.<br><strong><br>The men have been ordered not to shoot unless shot at.<br></strong><br>The hunt was set to continue through the night for the three robbers, said to be Indonesians and believed to be armed with a shotgun and two pistols.<br><br>They and one other man robbed a vegetable stall owner of RM$600 (S$270) at a wet market in Sedili town, then sped off by car to Pengerang, on the Johor River, and robbed a tour boat operator of RM$8,000 in cash and jewellery.<br><br>They also stole his motorised sampan, eluded Malaysian patrol boats and made a dash for Tekong, which is directly opposite Pengerang on Johor's south-eastern tip. The fourth robber fled in a car.<br><br>Tekong, 90 per cent of which is jungle, is used exclusively for SAF training, but for now, all field training has been cancelled and the soldiers have been ordered to stay in barracks. Other training is going on as usual.<br><br>The 5,000 or so recruits and other trainees and their instructors on the island are all safe and accounted for, said the Defence Ministry. Additional guards have been put in place to secure the island's ammunition base.<br><br>Even with some 5,000 soldiers in barracks, the SAF Ferry Terminal bristled with army and police personnel in full combat gear, including bullet-proof vests.<br><br>With the search dogs, they began scouring the jungle and swamps for the robbers at around 11am, as two RSAF helicopters circled overhead.<br><br>They found the robbers' motorised sampan abandoned off Tekong's south-eastern shoreline, a reclaimed area thick with palm trees, said Lieutenant-Colonel Richard Tan, head of general staff at SAF infantry headquarters.<br><br>A 30m-wide stream separates this area from the rest of Tekong, and soldiers patrolled its 1km length. Nearby, other soldiers moved to guard two bridges and a road that link these areas, hoping to cut off the escape.<br><strong><br>But the robbers may have got through, as the police searched the reclaimed area until 6pm and came up empty.<br></strong><br>On the SAF jetty, a sergeant whose unit was close to completing its stand-by duty yesterday, said: 'No one expected a real operation when we were activated for duty.<br><strong><br>'It seems so unreal, having to load real ammunition and knowing that we are facing armed men out there.'<br></strong><br>Safe in barracks, the recruits took things more lightly. One sent this SMS message to his girlfriend: 'Yeah! 16km road march cancelled...armed robbers running around Tekong.'<br><strong><br>Last night, in the Basic Military Training Centre, the CO's Night, a battalion party, went on as planned.<br></strong><br>Outside, in mud churned up by the afternoon downpour, searchers slogged through the night, using night-vision devices to hunt down the fugitives<br><br><img src="http://straitstimes.asia1.com.sg/mnt/media/image/launched/2004-03-19/P1A_0319.jpg"><br>Armed with assault rifles, SAF personnel in bullet-proof vests about to leave for Tekong yesterday afternoon<br><br><img src="http://straitstimes.asia1.com.sg/mnt/media/image/launched/2004-03-19/P1B_0319.jpg"><br>In a stolen sampan, the three robbers made a dash for the island, then abandoned the boat.<br><br>--ST</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>they wont shoot unless shot at???<br><br>in operation thunderbolt the key issue was to take no one alive. apparantly some of the hijackers surrendered but were taken to the aircraft toilet to be shot. thats y there was a lot of bullet holes only in the toilet not anywhere else. unless the bugger was using the toilet at the time. but honestly highly unlikely. the rationale is to send a strong deterent msg to other potential hijackers that singapore will not negotiate. thats why till now SQ doesnt have that kind of hijack problem (YET??). in addition to trial them in courts would also be a waste of taxpayers money. cos they also confirm get death penalty. so solve the problem asap.<br><br>so in this op. most likely the SAF will announce that the robbers fired the 1st shot, and as a defensive measure, the rest of the 700 ppl fired backed. to send them to trial and then deport them is a waste of time and resources. in this way our SAF can look good, send a msg out to these ppl not to mess with singapore and at the same time save money.<br><br>it will be a major embarassment if we cant catch them. so they will be caught and shot. they have to.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>SINGAPORE: The manhunt on Pulau Tekong for three gunmen has been narrowed down to the eastern part of the island.<br><br>MediaCorp's NewsRadio 93.8 quoted Mindef spokesman Lt Colonel Richard Tan as saying on Friday that efforts are now focused on the remaining 12 square kilometres, which covers about 40 percent of the island.<br><br>He explained that this area is filled with swamps and dense vegetation.<br><br>Overnight operations by 700 army and police personnel have covered more than half the island, used by Singapore for military training.<br><br>Lt Colonel Tan said they have not been able to flush out the three armed robbers, but he did not rule out the possibility that the trio may have already fled the island.<br><br>He reiterated that all field training on Pulau Tekong has been suspended.<br><br>The 5000 recruits and their instructors remain confined to their camps for indoor training.<br><br>There is no housing on the island.<br><br>The three robbers, believed to be Indonesians, are armed with a pistol and a shotgun.<br><br>The trio fled to the island in a wooden boat after two robberies in Johor on Thursday morning.<br><br>And at 9am, heavily armed soldiers, police special force officers as well as a dozen sniffer dogs were sent to the island to flush out the robbers.<br><br>To stop them from escaping using the same boat in which they fled from Johor, the island was cordoned off by the Coast Guard.<br><br>And since 90 percent of Pulau Tekong is covered in dense forest, two helicopters also joined the manhunt.<br><br>Right through the afternoon, more and more troops were deployed to Pulau Tekong to join in the manhunt.<br><br>By the evening, there were some 700 soldiers, police special forces and Gurkhas.<br><br>The Police Coast Guard also set up a command post at the jetty to facilitate the search operations.<br><br>At least one Malaysian patrol craft was also spotted in the waters just off Pulau Tekong.<br><br>"This group of robbers, one armed with a revolver and the other with a pump gun ... I believe they are dangerous," said Superintendent Tajudin Isa, Officer-in-Charge, Kota Tinggi District. - CNA<br><br></div>
