              <p>Limited army use in Thailand (even this I am not sure, their standard rifles are M16A1/2 and Tavor. SAR 21 could just have been borrowed during exercises), limited Indonesian units (they use own local products), and one police department in the US.</p>
              <p>Our previous SAR80 and SR88 were also exported- like shit to use. Export history is available on google or wikipedia.</p>

              <p>My Paper merely reprint from POPULAR MECHANIC magazine, so unless you are trying to claim that you are a well known professional arms expert and thus more authoritative than POPULAR MECHANIC, yours is nothing more then a personal unprofessional opinion.</p>
              <p>at least people stick their magazine reputation on it, you OTOH got what? how many articles have you published?</p>
              <p>secondly, being poor does not mean they will make bad choices.... though they will probably be limited in their options given their financial limitation, but such limitation at times could also force them to be hard discerning customers.  (especially if your country is in a conflict)</p>
              <p>but guess what... rifles aint that expensive, just check their military equipment listings, and viola!!! other then SAR-21, you will find that your so called "poor countries" can easily afford some of the more well known weapons too... like M-4, M-16, AK series and others like FN SCAR, F2000 as well.</p>

            <div class='col-md body'><p>It's harder to make inroads into developed countries with their own local arms developers, hence it's not surprising you don't see the US army or something like that using the SAR-21 en masse. <br><br>For an oversaturated small arms market, the SAR-21 is a pretty decent performer, nothing to shout about but nothing to scoff at as well. If you want to hazard a guess what earns STK the most money, I'd suspect it is their export of 40mm ammunition.<br><br>Anyway it's about time for an upgrade of sorts for the SAR-21. Seems to me the majority of us are still using the first few marks when STK has already made significant improvements to the design, but I am guessing the SAF sees no need to spend a lot to improve on what they deem to be "good enough". Ironically this means other countries could be using more updated versions of the rifle.</p></div>

              <p>The SAR-21 is decent in that some fundamentals are there (ie it cycles reliably, is short, durable and low maintenance) but other fundamentals are left out (balance, shape, weight, trigger &amp; selector and the LAD concept).
