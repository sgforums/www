            <div class='col-md body'>Whether the jets in the current inventory can replace the F5 depends on the aircraft payload, onboard avionics, endurance/range and of course the operational role to be replaced. It is not necessary to have one single aircraft type to replace all operational roles of F5. Therefore I would say what we have in the inventory will be more than capable to replace F5, its only a matter of re-distributing the jobs.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>We got the F-5 not because it was dbl engined.  More because the first series was nearly free under FMS.  The subsequent ones were not free when the economy boomed and foriegn aid dwindled.<br><br>F-5 was dbl engined because costs.  Excerpt from "Northrop F-5/F-20" by Jerry Scutts, Modern Combat Aircraft.<br><br>"One drawback foreseen was the use of a large conventional turbojet: not only would this require a large amount of fuel, but its cost would be high.  This factor was one of the primary reasons for the cancellation of furthter work on the Fang.  Tom Jones, then Northrop Planning Officer (later President and Chief Executive) felt that this was not the way the company should go.  He pressed for a reassessment of the fighter programme, with more emphasis on keeping the cost down.<br>At this point, Northuop's brainchild was helped considerably by the availability of very small turbojets being produced primarily for guided missiles.  With very high thrust to weight ratios and dimension modest enough to fit into a very compact fighter airframe, these engines became the crux of the aircraft Northrop was plannning."<br><br>The F-5 has the smallest engines ever.  The engines start after the auxilary air intakes.  Look at any F-5 taking off.  It is that small.<br><br>Due to same cost reasons, it have dry wings, eg all fuel is carried in the main fuselage.<br><br>The end result, the smallest fighter supersonic aircraft that can take off from a grass strip.  You need to respect this little bird as it is used for Agressor training.  This is mainly dogfight without radar using mainly eyes.<br><br>Cons, limited stores stations, limited radar capability.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>The radar upgrade increased the capability of the F5 tremendously. But no matter what, it is still using the same engine and same airframe.... So its weakness of short endurance was not addressed.<br><br>It is the most capable F5 because we are probably the only nation where the F5 is still a frontline figther, the other major users of F5Es like ROKAF and ROCAF have both obsolete most of their F5 fleet.<br><br>Similar to the A4, we are the last major users of the A4. that is why it is the "most capable" A4.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I will think that RSAF will just use the current F16 to replace F5... Because in the current warfare events... Dogfight is a thing of the past... There's not many dogfighting event due to the advancement of guided weaponery... and practically... F16 can totally handle air-to-air and air-to-land... Buying a new aircraft is a waste of tax-payer money... Don't forget that you need to train the new pilot to adapt the new plane, shipping the aircraft to australia, india, US for training...<br><br>The US had already tried a SCRAM jet engine plane from New Zealand to LA... It flew there in 1 hour only... So basically, future warfare will just be missile flying around... Geneva War convention stated that a war had to be declared in 1 hour advance... so that both party can be prepared and moblise...  You can call the US to declare "WAR" while preparing the tactics... the rockets are already at your door-step...<br><br>Due to technology advancement, aircraft will not longer be carrying pilots... everything is radio controlled...

Most of it used up.  For the Grifo radar, the bulkhead actually was in the way and they have to do major structural work on the nose.  Not speced out originally.<br><br>The turbojet engines isn't exactly cold.<br><br>Zeroing the airframes involves stripping down the entire jet.  Not too sure if ST have the necessary parts and skills to do it. Not to talk about cost.<br><br>Yes it is a great aircraft, but it is time to move on.</div></blockquote>Agree on the space limitation within the fuselage.<br><br>Though I remember Celsius and some other company approach this by incorporating ECM jammers into pylons and other conformal packages attached to pylons strong points(centreline station).<br><br>There must be other ways to add black boxes too.</div>
