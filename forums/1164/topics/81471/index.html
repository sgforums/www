            <div class='col-md body'>Hi guys, ermm..want to ask a few qns which may sound silly to all NSmen who already ORDied duno how long liao...I just ORDied recently...n started to work..n my Reservist letter haven come yet...but today I receive a call suddenly from 443SAR who tell me I have been posted to 443SAR for reservist. Which I 1st thought was funny, coz I actually disrupted for studies during my NSF, and should joined my old unit from 41SAR b4 my disruption(which is the current 408SAR) for reservist. And wats worst is the guy told me on the phone that 443SAR is currently under Open Mobilisation standby from 1st June to 15th June (and today is already the 5th June then they call 2 tell me!! isnt that too rushed?), and I am liable to be mobilise and report back to camp and so on. Ermm..a few qns I would like 2 ask are:<br><br>1) During the period 1st to 15th June the person tell me is actually the "manning period" issit ?<br><br>2) Are we confirmed to be mobilised at least once during any of such standby periods or jus liable ?<br><br>3) Other then field pack with items, SBO, helmet and reporting back in Uniform, bring that small NS Booklet and 11B and IC back, wat else do u guys bring back ?<br><br>4) Most of the time a mob happens, do we report back and after a briefing, go home, or proceed to a real exercise ? If proceed to a real exercise, is that counted as a reservice ?<br><br>5) Other than TV, Radio and other medias ? Will we be contacted by hp ?<br><br>6) What is the duration to allow us to report to camp in time ?<br><br>7) What number do we call to enquire abt Reservice Units ? And can we request to change our Reservice Unit back to our original ones ?<br><br>Many thanks bros and uncles, pardon me for my blurness  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_sad.gif" alt="Sad" title="Sad"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Yes, you can be posted out of your NS unit if you didn't ORD'd with them. As for petitioning them to take you back, I'm doubtful: your designated replacement must be himself unreliable with attendance (enough for them to want to dump him as well).<br><br>Who called you - unit i/c, unit S1 cell, etc.? I'm surprised you weren't called up to attend a mob briefing beforehand. How come 2 weeks?<br><br>I won't be cavalier with the word "standby". Mob "manning" is mob manning; the other requires you to pack a standard fullpack, for one thing.<br><br>No "confirmation" about activation; they can call you back anytime with the assigned period. If it's just to track reporting time, you'll only have to physically sign in &amp; then go home (no debriefing even). Nope, it won't count as an ICT if you move out for deployment, if that's what you meant.<br><br>No contact by hp with an open-mob. The people activating it doesn't have direct access to the requisite unit rosters, nor the logistics to call everyone up. FYI The latter's actually done by your own unit people, with a silent mob.<br><br>Icemoon is correct with the reporting times. KAH = Key Appointment Holder. Sorry, the phone #'s aren't known to the general public.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote>There may be no mob briefing. Usually they send you a letter informing you of the manning, what to bring and pack etc.</blockquote>Not in my case. They usually did the general mob briefings at the tailend of my ICTs, but I was also regularly called back - as a recall i/c - to attend half-days briefings in case it's a silent mob. During the latter times, I often see a few unfamiliar reservists - presumably temporarily attached or newly posted to my unit - being pulled aside to get their own general mob briefings. Some of them stood out cuz they were really "old birds", complaining to the SAF regulars that they're too old to be targeted, that they can't understand the English-language regulations, etc.<br><br><blockquote>You have to prepare a standard fullpack in both cases.</blockquote>Actually I've never packed a standard pack; ditto my kakis. We brought in what we usually bring for our ICTs, albeit with prior networked knowledge of whether it's only a sign-in, or draw-arms, or move-out activation. The officers, KAHs &amp; others who reported very early would spread the word by phone (if it's something out of the ordinary). I remember us being caught out only once on the "standby" regimentation, but they didn't formally check the equipment until the M+6 hour was up, so there was some last-minute scrambling to bulk-buy items. Even then, I don't recall any formal scolding on incomplete equipment either. Probably can't say the same for our CO, though.</div>

And I haven even receive my letter of reservist yet, then a few days ago, someone from my camp(I can see is my own camp's number from my caller ID) called me and told me I am attached to that particular reservist unit already and I am suppose to be under MOB standby for that 2 weeks. Yes, I didnt hear wrong, its 2 weeks. And I oso duno y. I called my Chief Clerk from my unit S1, and ask told her abt my situation, she told me I shldnt be under a MOB list so fast, coz I haven even ORD for one mth yet, n moreover they shld hav inform me 1st hand by mail 1st and I shld go thru a briefing then can. She oso confirmed with me the MOB manning is 2 weeks.

            <div class='col-md body'>I dunno how much the SAF policy has changed with regards to phone contact as a communication tool for callups &amp; mob postings (beyond the legal liability). Where I came from, that not enough per se - you had to be formally informed either via black-&amp;-white or a physical presence, &amp; by an appriopriately-senior figure at that (SSG or WO).<br><br>That's why I asked the thread-starter who contacted him. If it was from a clerk (unit S1 or reservist faciliator), they should've correspondingly sent along a mob letter, registered-post if need be. If it was from a recall i/c - &amp; I've done this before myself as instructed - it's done usually to confirm the phone #'s as contactable, &amp; I also had one guy basically making the same complaints as Raynor's done here. (I dunno whether to believe him, but told him to call the battalion office anyway.)<br><br>It's tempting to treat these cases cynically, as with the "old birds" from my previous post, but I've learnt in time to give them the benefit of the doubt. Many of them are, for want of a better description, "peripheral" soldiers - armourers, MT-line technicans &amp;, when we still had them, cooks - who were SBMT-trained but largely did their NS in their own "world", away from the more-regimented operational units &amp; thus unfamiliar with things like mob manning. That said, some of them do made a smooth transition - I know this ammo storeman who converted into a "kilat" RP - but most remained so-called "misfits" who took cover in the bunks when they're not needed. But their vocational skills are much valued, if you want tasteful meals, or your Land Rover to be repaired, or your hastily-cleaned rifle ~wink~ to be accepted when returned!</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>evozero, thanks for the warning but I've read the posting guidelines &amp; think I've been discreet enough - unless this board is irrationally kiasi.<br><br>I think those who had to "standby" got a letter notice beforehand but, reservists being reservists, some of them are half-serious about it. Thankfully, my unit officers/KAHs were cognizant of this, would plan ahead &amp; get the max out of the situation. Translated, that meant designating an area for the standby formation as they reported in, with periodic semi-formal fullpack checks. Those who lacked stuff are asked to borrow them from non-standby people &amp;, as a last measure, resorted to joining a bulk-buying before H-hour.<br><br>The bigger context here is many reservists don't possess a complete set of personal equipment in the 1st place - or anymore. I mean, how many of you still have the "green" vest &amp; "blue" shorts? Jackknife &amp; rifle-cleaning kit (I didn't ORD with either)? A fork (to go with your spoon)? Also, they've gotten used to the QM providing the expendables - toilet roll, powder, etc. - but doesn't know if he'll do the same for the mob standbys.<br><br>I-like-flings(m), the junior sergeant-major conducted the formal equipment check; the inspectors just stood aside &amp; took notes. That's the thing - I get the impression that they were more interested in the overall operational efficiency (reporting times, complete &amp; proper stores, functional transports, etc.). Hope I've worded this right: IMO there's no need to overemphasize on standard fullpacks per se. Yes, it's an important individual responsibility, except it's not a be-all either: at worst you're deducted marks for it, but then it's only one component towards calculating an overall passing grade. I'd even dare say our CO didn't get scolded, if the inspectors had noted how we positively improvised to meet the standby-pack criterion.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Zenmaster is right. The manning periods are planned long ago, so it is Brigade (active or reservist) policy (since the unit is practically non-existent normally) to send a letter informing you of the manning date, your codewords, where to report and the stuffs to pack. Moxie, maybe your Brigade is just that ... slack?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"><br><br>About the 2 weeks manning period, I'm surprised. I'm just beginning to understand how this whole mobilisation biz works, but I guess this is not an appropriate topic to discuss here.<br><br>About using the phone as communication tool, well I suppose we can wait for the day when they use SMS for callups and mob postings .. hahahaha<br><br>About personal equipment .. Moxie, what green vest?? I thought should be grey vest? Jackknife is a standard SBO item, but rifle cleaning kit is a restricted item, so you wouldn't ORD with that.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Icemoon, I don't comment on what's beyond my realm, but suffice to say we worked with Formation authorities at most, rather than with Brigade staff. My CO may have answered to such higher-ups - I dunno - but certainly not on the day itself. There's just too much logistical inspections to be conducted, after which I guess reports have to be tallied together &amp; written up before submission.<br><br>Green vests/blue shorts - guess I'm from a different era. Jackknife? Man, I've already upgraded myself to a Swiss pocketknife during my active days; funny how the latter's not accepted as a "standby" tool by chickensh*tters interpreting the word "standard" to the literal. Ditto the PT-kit colors which I mentioned, even rolled-up vs. rolled-down sleeves  - some trainers insist on one common standard; others don't give a damn (at another time).<br><br>Zenmaster, ah yes, the e-mart. Sadly, I could only take advantage of it during my last couple of ICTs - all of us stocked up on running shoes (&amp; sometimes socks) since we had little use left for the other military stuff - &amp; could only rely on the old-style "gift shop" for most of my serving days. Of course there's the infamous kit-exchange - whose people are either unpunctual or unlocateable, &amp; highly reluctant to accept anything except rotting or totally condemned items anyway.</div>
