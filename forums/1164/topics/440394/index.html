              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"><span>WASHINGTON: US 
              justice officials on Tuesday charged four Singaporeans and one Iranian 
              with fraudulently exporting radio equipment to Iran that subsequently 
              ended up in roadside bombs in Iraq.<br><br>At least 16 radio antennas 
              were found in unexploded improvised explosive devices (IEDs) in Iraq, 
              the US Justice Department said in a statement, noting that the Iranian 
              suspect in the case is still at large.<br><br>The indictment said 
              thousands of antennas were meant to be exported from the United States 
              to Iran, and in addition to the four Singaporeans, four companies from 
              the Asian city state had been charged in the alleged plot.<br><br>Admiral
               Mike Mullen, then the top US military officer, said in July that Iran 
              was stepping up its support for Shiite militants in Iraq, supplying them
               with more sophisticated weapons that were being used against American 
              forces.<br><br>"Yesterday, authorities in Singapore arrested Wong Yuh 
              Lan (Wong), Lim Yong Nam (Nam), Lim Kow Seng (Seng), and Hia Soo Gan 
              Benson (Hia), all citizens of Singapore, in connection with a US request
               for extradition," the justice department statement said.<br><br>"The 
              United States is seeking their extradition to stand trial in the 
              District of Columbia," where the US capital Washington is located.<br><br>"The remaining individual defendant, Hossein Larijani, is a citizen and resident of Iran who remains at large," it added.<br><br>Assistant
               Attorney General for National Security Lisa Monaco said the defendants 
              had attempted to subvert export controls by sending US-origin components
               to Iran rather than their stated destination of Singapore.<br><br>"Ultimately, several of these components were found in unexploded improvised explosive devices in Iraq," she said.<br><br>"This
               case underscores the continuing threat posed by Iranian procurement 
              networks seeking to obtain US technology through fraud and the 
              importance of safeguarding that technology."<br><br>US Attorney Ronald 
              Machen said the defendants misled US companies in buying parts that 
              ended up in IEDs on the battlefield in Iraq. "We hope for a swift 
              response from Singapore to our request for extradition," he added.<br><br>US
               officials regularly accuse Iran of meddling in the politics of 
              Baghdad's Shiite-led government, and training and backing militant 
              groups that target US troops in the south of Iraq.<br><br>Analysts have 
              voiced concern that Tehran's ability to interfere could increase as a 
              result of President Barack Obama's announcement last week that all US 
              troops will be pulled out of Iraq by the end of this year.<br><br>-AFP/ac</span></span></p>
