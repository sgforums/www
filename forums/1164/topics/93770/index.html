            <div class='col-md body'>more newsfeed, new development this time.<br><br>(Source: HDW; issued Sept.13, 2004)<br><br>By the name of Â“U 33Â”, today Jutta Doenitz christened one of the most modern non-nuclear submarines in the world from Howaldtswerke-Deutsche Werft AG (HDW) in Kiel. The Class 212 A submarine is intended for service in the German Navy, and is the third of four submarines, which are currently being built at HDW and at the Nordseewerke in Emden. After an extensive period of sea trials, it is expected that Â“U 33Â” will enter service on 31 January 2006.<br><br>The characteristic feature of the new submarine Class 212, which has been developed by HDW, is an atmospheric air-independent propulsion system based on the hydrogen fuel cell. HDW is thus the first company in the world to produce a production-ready fuel-cell propulsion system. The fuel cell, which produces electricity from hydrogen and oxygen, enables the new class of submarine to cruise submerged for weeks at a time. Conventional diesel-electric submarines have exhausted their batteries after about two daysÂ’ submerged cruising. In addition, the fuel cell generates no noise and no exhaust heat. It is thus virtually impossible to fix the submarineÂ’s position.<br><br>The further development of position-finding technology and the increasing number of submarine-hunting methods, together with the extended field of deployment, necessitated the development of the new Class A generation of submarines. The extremely favorable signatures, the fuel-cell propulsion system and the position-finding and weapons technology will ensure that the new type of submarines will be successful in every conceivable field of operations. At the same time, the design of the vessel is characterized by a high degree of availability and low maintenance costs.<br><br>In the speech he made at the christening, HDW Board member Walter Freitag pointed out that the very early decision to use the fuel cell in submarine construction had laid the foundations for HDWÂ’s technological market leadership.<br><br>The development of the fuel cell propulsion system has produced a series of subsequent orders for HDW. Thus, HDW has received orders for seven submarines of the export version Class 214 submarine, of which four vessels are for the Greek Navy and three other vessels for the Korean Navy. The Italian Navy has also followed the example of the German Navy with two Class 212 A submarines, which are being built at Fincantieri. The Portuguese Navy has signed a contract to have three of its Class 209 submarines modernized with a fuel-cell propulsion system. Eventually, the Greek Navy will have 3 of its Class 209 submarines modernized with a fuel cell propulsion system. Thus, the German technology of the atmospheric air-independent submarine propulsion system is meanwhile being used by five Navies.<br><br>Thus, the German technology of the atmospheric air-independent submarine propulsion system is meanwhile being used by five Navies.<br><br></div>
